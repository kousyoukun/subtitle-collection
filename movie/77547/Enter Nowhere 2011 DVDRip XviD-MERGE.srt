1
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:20,216
Register... now! Everything!

2
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,553
Do it!

3
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:23,928
I'll open it.

4
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:27,473
Come on, come on!

5
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,936
- What about the safe?
- We don't have time for the safe.

6
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,396
- Do it now!
- There you are, here.

7
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:35,649
Come on, come on,
come on... money.

8
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:40,904
Get the car.

9
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,406
- I said open it.
- I'll open it,

10
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,908
but I don't think
you'll like what's inside.

11
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:47,910
What the hell
are you talking about?

12
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,079
Interesting life
you've chosen for yourself.

13
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:51,914
- Just shut the fuck up!
- All the things you could have

14
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,876
done in life... you don't even care
that you're going nowhere.

15
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,339
I'm gonna give you

16
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:01,340
to the count of three.

17
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:03,927
One...

18
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,679
two...

19
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:37,135
You always help yourself
to other people's food?

20
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:40,722
Let me help you.

21
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,768
I have a first aid kit inside.

22
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:01,325
I'm sorry I helped myself
to your food.

23
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,744
It's just I haven't eaten anything
since breakfast yesterday.

24
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,664
What are you doing out here?

25
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:09,083
Our car ran out of gas last night

26
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:13,670
and my husband went
to go look for a service station,

27
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,675
I don't know. Late.

28
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:20,135
Would it be possible
to use your phone?

29
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,053
Yeah, sure.
If you can find one.

30
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,014
Pardon?

31
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,435
You know how to work
a busted radio?

32
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,064
You don't know how to fix it?

33
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,690
This isn't my cabin.

34
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,231
Then what are you doing here?

35
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:37,735
Same as you... car trouble.

36
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,242
I've been stranded here
for three days.

37
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:47,746
Three days?
And you haven't left?

38
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,581
Where am I gonna go?
There's no phone.

39
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:52,709
My car's toast. I haven't been able
to walk out for help.

40
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:55,044
Listen...

41
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:57,546
I appreciate your predicament,

42
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:01,217
but I... I need
to find my husband.

43
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:05,138
Look, that read -5° last night.

44
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,392
What are you saying?

45
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:11,394
Nothing.

46
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,398
- I'm sure he found some help.
- Oh, my God.

47
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:17,400
Look, I'm sure he's fine.

48
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:26,618
You have matches?

49
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:30,789
Can I?

50
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,083
I thought I was gonna
freeze to death.

51
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,138
How did you survive?

52
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,475
It was below freezing.

53
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,311
We have blankets in our car.

54
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:56,687
I practically made
an igloo out of them.

55
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:00,316
Blankets?

56
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,614
I think you just became
my new best friend.

57
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:07,615
Tom.

58
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,535
Samantha.

59
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,414
How about showing me
where that car is, Sam?

60
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,639
Well, you weren't kidding
when you said your car ran out of gas.

61
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,767
Sam?

62
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:39,023
so what happened to you?

63
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:42,150
I put my car in a ditch
about a half a mile up.

64
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:46,946
When you said you had car trouble,
you weren't joking.

65
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,739
I...

66
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:51,742
- Practically broke my leg.
- Oh, my goodness.

67
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:55,371
It doesn't hurt now.

68
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:59,292
I'm gonna stay here
for a little while,

69
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,167
wait for my husband
to get back.

70
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:04,421
I'll stay with you.

71
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:16,391
That's a good idea.

72
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:20,228
Just in case, you know?

73
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:24,776
It'll be getting' dark soon.

74
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:29,612
We really should get back before
the temperature drops.

75
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:34,075
What if Adam comes back
and I'm not here?

76
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:37,412
We'll leave him a note. Do you have
any pen and paper in the car?

77
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,332
Maybe in the glove box.

78
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,241
How do you know
no one lives there?

79
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:18,286
Well, if someone does,
they haven't been there in a while.

80
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,374
Pretty cool car.

81
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,083
You think so?

82
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,420
Yeah, it's a classic.

83
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,271
Here... here, I'll take that.

84
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:49,649
Thank you.

85
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:58,617
Is there a bathroom anywhere?

86
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:00,576
You see all this?

87
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:03,871
There's your bathroom.

88
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:10,421
Right.

89
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,701
There you go.

90
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,245
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

91
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,706
Those blankets are a lifesaver.

92
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,919
So where's the water
from anyway?

93
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:53,587
Oh, I found a creek outback.

94
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,006
Well, at least we won't go thirsty.

95
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:58,009
About that...

96
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,803
I tried to find the creek again,

97
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,096
but I couldn't find it.

98
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:05,431
So we have one tank of gas.

99
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:08,685
Right. You know,
I've got some paint buckets

100
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,019
and some rubber hosing
in the back of my truck.

101
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,982
I bet I could siphon gas
from my car to yours.

102
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:17,193
- Would that work?
- Yeah, I think it would.

103
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,028
Get us out of here.

104
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:21,113
Get us to your husband.

105
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:23,616
I should've never let him go.

106
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,952
When Adam gets
an idea in his head,

107
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:27,578
there's no stopping him.

108
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:30,707
Well, why didn't you
just go with him?

109
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,210
He...

110
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,379
didn't want me to leave the car

111
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:41,968
- in my condition.
- What's your condition?

112
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,057
I'm pregnant.

113
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,392
You're smoking.

114
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:52,061
I know.

115
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:55,690
It's my last pack.

116
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:58,234
We were on our way to

117
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:01,737
see his parents before he ships off...

118
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:04,906
tell them the news.
He ships out in two weeks.

119
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:08,910
Anyway, I smoke when I'm nervous,

120
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:12,414
obviously.

121
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:13,998
Tonight you can have the bed.

122
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:17,085
I'll sleep on the floor.

123
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:18,838
I'm gonna get us out of here.

124
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:22,133
Okay.

125
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,419
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my goodness.

126
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:44,546
Are you okay?

127
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,394
Where am I?

128
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,690
You... you were out
in the cold and...

129
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,859
Who are you?

130
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,320
My name is Samantha.
Who are you?

131
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,164
- I was just trying to help you.
- Where's Kevin?

132
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,791
I don't know who that is.

133
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,334
- Where is he?
- You were asleep on the porch.

134
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:51,838
I found you out there.
I brought you inside.

135
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,841
That is all I know.

136
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,015
Where are you going?

137
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,641
Away from here.

138
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,643
Well, if you find anyone

139
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:09,438
will you please tell them
about this cabin?

140
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,527
And if you don't,
you're welcome to come back here.

141
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:27,539
Shit!

142
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,861
Hello?

143
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,532
Is anybody out there?

144
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:14,085
- Tom?
- No, not Tom... Jody.

145
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,546
Did you see anyone at the road?

146
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:20,216
Excuse me!

147
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,799
Where is your phone?

148
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:23,385
We don't have a phone.

149
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,139
What? What the hell
kinda place is this?

150
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,891
You don't have to be so rude.

151
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,601
I thought you said
I was welcome back.

152
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,728
Well, you are but...

153
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:34,938
Listen...

154
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:36,732
what's your name again?

155
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:38,567
Samantha.

156
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,568
Right... Sam,

157
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:43,322
I don't know if you're a hermit

158
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:45,573
or a serial killer
or whatever your deal is,

159
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,576
but I need to get
a phone, okay?

160
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,619
And I need to get the hell
out of here. Capisce?

161
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,788
I just told you,
we don't have a phone.

162
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,288
Now if you'll just let me explain...

163
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:55,584
Okay, so there is
no form of communication

164
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,086
anywhere in this goddamn shack?

165
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:02,048
We have a broken ham radio.

166
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:04,843
Awesome.

167
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:08,138
What am I supposed
to do with that?

168
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,973
I don't... is there a bathroom?

169
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:14,310
We don't have one.

170
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,395
I am in hell.

171
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:20,191
I am in the third ring of hell.

172
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,612
Did you see anyone by the road?

173
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,114
Yeah, I heard some crazy guy
yelling in the distance,

174
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,782
but I don't know
if he was your friend or not.

175
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,993
But, you know, I've seen
"Deliverance" enough times

176
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,162
to know that you don't
go messing with the locals.

177
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:36,916
"Deliverance"?

178
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:40,754
You've never seen "Deliverance"?

179
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,714
"Squeal like a pig"?

180
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,675
Oh, boy.

181
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,715
Great.

182
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,941
I like your lighter.

183
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:47,778
Really? 'Cause there's
only a zillion of them

184
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,196
in every gas station in America.

185
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:52,365
But I guess when
you live in a cabin,

186
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,033
you don't get out that much.

187
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:56,827
Oh, I don't live here.

188
00:21:56,953 --> 00:22:01,249
- You don't?
- No, I'm like you.

189
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:03,960
My husband and I ran out of gas

190
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,713
and got stuck here.

191
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:09,841
I wound up at this cabin
yesterday morning.

192
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,802
First of all, Sam,

193
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:16,472
you're nothing like me.

194
00:22:17,931 --> 00:22:20,267
If I don't live here
and you don't live here,

195
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:23,813
then who lives here?

196
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:27,982
What?

197
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:30,068
I thought I heard something.

198
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:31,821
Shit.

199
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:35,741
You're more paranoid than me
and you ain't even smoking.

200
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,081
Who's this?

201
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,916
I'm Jody.

202
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:45,958
Are you the husband?

203
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,128
No, this is Tom.

204
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:49,545
Pleasure to meet you.

205
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:52,256
How did it go with the cars?

206
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:55,384
It didn't go,
but I got you these shoes.

207
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,428
I figured you could use them.

208
00:22:57,553 --> 00:23:00,807
Thank you.

209
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,437
What is that,
weed you're smoking?

210
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:08,189
You a cop?

211
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:10,316
Hardly.

212
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:15,113
So what's your story?

213
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:17,615
My story?
What's your story?

214
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:20,158
It's an epic saga.
You first.

215
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:21,785
I've been stranded up here four days,

216
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,663
living off granola and creek water.

217
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:25,790
What do you mean, stranded?

218
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:29,293
He got in a car accident.

219
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:32,671
Listen, Sam, we shouldn't
keep the Axe outside.

220
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:35,342
- It's our only weapon.
- Why would we need a weapon?

221
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:38,468
We're in the wilderness
and I thought I heard a gunshot.

222
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:39,969
A gunshot?

223
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:43,641
Okay, no bathrooms,

224
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:46,977
no phone, and now you guys
are talking about weapons?

225
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:50,897
This is a great operation
you guys are running here and all,

226
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:54,610
but I'm not gonna be part of it.
I'm outta here.

227
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,528
It's below freezing at night.

228
00:23:56,654 --> 00:24:01,366
- I'll take my chances.
- You'll be dead in the morning.

229
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,995
If suicide's your plan, go for it.

230
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,249
But would you mind leaving behind
your vintage ski jacket?

231
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,710
Samantha here
could probably use it.

232
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:14,878
Now I want to know your story.

233
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,299
My name's Jody from Detroit.

234
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:19,301
I got into a fight
with my boyfriend.

235
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,720
He kicked me out of the car
and left me on the side of the road.

236
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:22,971
Why would he do that?

237
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,346
'Cause he's a dickhead.

238
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:27,266
And that's all
you deserve to know.

239
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,894
Well, Jody from Detroit,
you can stay here tonight.

240
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,816
But you're gonna have to start
pitching in... starting with that lighter.

241
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:42,407
Oh, and for your information,

242
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:44,868
this is a brand-new jacket

243
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:49,081
For your information
I don't give a shit.

244
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:55,920
What are you doing?

245
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,506
I'm nailing it shut.

246
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,717
It'll be warmer this way.

247
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:05,096
So what was
the sleeping situation

248
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,348
- like last night?
- I slept on the floor.

249
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,517
Really?

250
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:12,021
Two people alone in the woods,

251
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:15,397
with a cabin.

252
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,403
What are you insinuating?

253
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,279
Nothing.

254
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:24,198
I have a husband.

255
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,033
- So?
- Why don't you just keep

256
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,825
- your thoughts to yourself?
- I would never do that.

257
00:25:28,952 --> 00:25:30,285
Shame. I'd do him.

258
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,245
Enough!

259
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:34,917
If you're wondering about
tonight's sleeping situation,

260
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,210
you've got the floor.

261
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,422
Samantha keeps the bed.

262
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,466
You're so protective, Tom.
Am I on the floor next to you?

263
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:46,093
- You're on the floor next to you.
- Boring.

264
00:25:46,219 --> 00:25:49,097
Do you always make people
hate you within an hour?

265
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:52,808
I just don't understand why at least
me and her can't share the bed.

266
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:56,102
Because I said so.

267
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:58,605
Because she's pregnant.

268
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,775
She's pregnant?

269
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,568
Good job with the smoking, Sam.

270
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:05,946
Are you trying to give the fetus cancer
before it's even born?

271
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:08,949
Leave her alone.

272
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:11,494
God, you are so high and mighty.

273
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:14,955
Well, how is it that you got to this
cabin days and days before us?

274
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,124
I crashed my car into a ditch.

275
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:19,334
Yeah, and where is this ditch?

276
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,711
- It's back at the road.
- How do we know you're not

277
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:25,174
just some lumberjack psycho
who lures young women to his cabin

278
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:26,968
and tells them
there's no way to communicate

279
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,470
or get back to the real world?

280
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,345
You can leave whenever
you want, lady.

281
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:34,516
- You nailed the door shut!
- Because it's freezing outside!

282
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:37,311
I'm no murderer or rapist

283
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,355
or whatever sick shit
you wanna dream up.

284
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,023
- Then who are you?
- I'm just a guy

285
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:43,943
with one thing on his mind... survival.

286
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,487
And don't think for one second
that you being here

287
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:52,868
is helping our food situation
at all, 'cause it's not.

288
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,874
Let's just get some sleep.

289
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:34,909
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

290
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,038
Where's your little boyfriend at?

291
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,999
He's not my boyfriend.
I have a husband.

292
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,212
Oh, yeah.

293
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:47,254
Whatever.

294
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,383
Where did Mr. Rogers
go to this time?

295
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:52,927
Well, now that his leg
is feeling better,

296
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:56,555
he decided to walk as far as he can and
try and find that creek and get help.

297
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,473
Crap, is this all
the food that we have?

298
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,060
Yes, and we need
to conserve it.

299
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:05,772
Right.

300
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:11,988
Well, I'm just gonna go.

301
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,738
I don't wanna waste
all your food.

302
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:16,325
- No, it's not like that.
- No, it's cool. It's fine.

303
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:18,911
There's gotta be someplace
with electricity around here,

304
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:20,413
so I'm just gonna go.

305
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:23,748
Tom's been looking for days
and he hasn't found anything.

306
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:26,044
Well, I'm just gonna go
in the opposite direction.

307
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:30,171
I mean, he keeps going out the front,
I'm just gonna go out the back.

308
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,341
I don't mean to be a bitch.
It just comes naturally to me.

309
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,593
So no hard feelings.

310
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:40,390
And if I never see you again,
then good luck.

311
00:28:40,515 --> 00:28:43,476
You too.

312
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:29,456
You're back.

313
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,419
Yeah, you miss me?

314
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:54,896
Thanks.

315
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:58,817
So where were you headed
before you ended up here?

316
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:02,029
We were on our way
to my husband's parents' house

317
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:04,990
to tell them the news.

318
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,909
They hate me.

319
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,912
You?

320
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:15,041
Miss Goody-Two Shoes? Why?

321
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:20,172
They're Jewish.
I'm Catholic.

322
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,133
You know, you don't
look knocked up.

323
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,262
I just found out
about a week ago.

324
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:30,014
I'm due in October
or early November.

325
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:34,060
So he's gonna be
a little Scorpio hellion just like me.

326
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,978
I'm November 11th,

327
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,271
but I ain't having kids.

328
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,528
Somehow I think the world
would be better for it.

329
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,446
Good one, Sam.

330
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,200
You're starting
to loosen up a bit.

331
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,993
Where do the parents live?

332
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,121
Just outside of Concord,
New Hampshire.

333
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,373
That's kind of a schlep.

334
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,124
Not really.

335
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,920
Trust me, I've been
to that shithole of a town.

336
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,549
I wouldn't go
within 100 miles of there.

337
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,804
Are you from San Diego?

338
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,180
You look like
a San Diego chick.

339
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,557
Virginia.

340
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,227
Virginia?
Well then,

341
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,021
what are you
doing in Wisconsin?

342
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,814
Excuse me?

343
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,235
Well, if you were on your way to
New Hampshire, coming from Virginia,

344
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,697
then how did you wind up
in Wisconsin? Wrong turn?

345
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,703
We're not in Wisconsin.

346
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,541
Look, I'm not trying
to be an asshole,

347
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,375
but we're just 50 miles

348
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,168
outside of Milwaukee.

349
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:48,048
No, we're about two hours
from Concord, New Hampshire.

350
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,428
Well, I find that hard to believe,

351
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,514
because I was headed to Seattle
coming from Detroit,

352
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,270
so there's no way I could be
in fucking Concord, New Hampshire.

353
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:35,554
You gotta be kidding me.

354
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,981
Okay, I think I'm going crazy.

355
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,901
I could have sworn I was
heading in a straight line,

356
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:52,655
and then I just ended up back here.

357
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:55,157
I'll tell you who's crazy...
that bitch.

358
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:58,243
- What are you talking about?
- She thinks we're in New Hampshire.

359
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,036
- New Hampshire?
- Yeah.

360
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:02,497
She says she's on her way
to Concord, New Hampshire,

361
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,460
coming from Virginia.

362
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,797
- Ask her!
- Yeah, I'll ask her.

363
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,146
How did it go?

364
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:29,440
Listen...

365
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:30,817
I was talking with Jody...

366
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:33,444
I can't take her any more, Tom.
I can't.

367
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,279
She's out of her mind.

368
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:39,490
No one's gonna fight you
on that one.

369
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,161
But she did tell me
something kind of odd.

370
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:45,205
She said we're not
in New Hampshire?

371
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,957
Right.

372
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,376
See, she's clearly lost it.

373
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:54,672
But we're not in New Hampshire.

374
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:59,636
Did you get Tom to go along
with your little game?

375
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:02,596
Samantha, it's not a game.

376
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:06,475
We're nowhere near New Hampshire.

377
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:10,647
Well, we sure as hell
are not in Wisconsin.

378
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,735
Wisconsin?

379
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,155
I never said anything
about Wisconsin.

380
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:22,866
What the hell did you just say?

381
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:24,494
Where do you think we are, Tom?

382
00:35:24,618 --> 00:35:25,995
South Dakota.

383
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,497
South Dakota?
What are you talking about?

384
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:30,624
We're like 50 miles
outside of Milwaukee.

385
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,209
I think I know where I am.

386
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:34,503
I was going from Oklahoma City
to South Dakota.

387
00:35:34,628 --> 00:35:36,548
You guys are both crazy.

388
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:38,674
I'm not in Wisconsin!
There's no way.

389
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:43,553
Well, there's sure as hell no way
that I'm in goddamn South Dakota!

390
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:50,518
Something's not right
about this cabin.

391
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:53,438
No. You know what, Tom?

392
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:55,023
You're not right, okay?

393
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:57,191
Fuck South Dakota,
fuck New Hampshire,

394
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,944
and fuck you!
And fuck you too!

395
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:02,198
Be honest with me!

396
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:06,953
Do you really think
we're somewhere in Wisconsin?

397
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,621
Honestly?

398
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:14,585
New Hampshire?

399
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,812
This doesn't make any sense.

400
00:36:33,937 --> 00:36:36,857
What, did we disappear?

401
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,611
No.

402
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:45,823
If we disappeared,
then how could Adam find us?

403
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:50,620
You don't think
he's alive, do you?

404
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:55,124
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Answer the question.

405
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:01,966
No.

406
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,303
No.

407
00:37:07,678 --> 00:37:10,598
If we don't do something,

408
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:14,393
we're gonna run out of food
and water if we stay here.

409
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,357
Tomorrow we're just gonna have
to walk as far as we can go.

410
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,985
We may be dead either way,

411
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:26,447
but I'd rather die trying.

412
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:55,057
Forget the road, Tom.

413
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:56,935
Why?

414
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,439
You've gone that way
long enough.

415
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,569
Fine.

416
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:15,054
Look, I'm sorry
if I made you angry.

417
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:17,389
I'm sure Adam's fine.

418
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:22,644
I'm not angry because
you think my husband is dead.

419
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:27,648
I'm angry because
I think you're right.

420
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,127
Between you and me,

421
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,755
I think your husband's just fine.

422
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,093
I don't want
to talk about my husband.

423
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:58,095
What about your boyfriend?

424
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,931
He's an asshole.

425
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:03,393
A bad influence as
my "mother" would say.

426
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,394
Your "mother"?

427
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:07,939
Yeah. I actually
never met my mother.

428
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:09,440
She died the day I was born.

429
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:12,360
I was raised
with my grandparents.

430
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,444
Ladies,

431
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,447
let's keep it moving. Jeez.

432
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:18,907
I wanna get out of here
before it gets dark.

433
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:21,993
Yeah.

434
00:40:25,414 --> 00:40:29,334
So is this the farthest
you've gotten mileage-wise?

435
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,213
Are you okay?

436
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:36,258
Where'd you get
all that money?

437
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:38,343
None of your business.

438
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:40,845
Well, I'm making it my business.

439
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,098
I got it working
with my boyfriend, okay?

440
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:46,309
And that's all you need to know.

441
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,603
Guys?

442
00:40:48,728 --> 00:40:52,273
What's this?

443
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:06,703
What is that?

444
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:26,014
Need some help there, Tom?

445
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:29,559
I got it.

446
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:34,940
There we go.

447
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:10,057
Oh, my God.

448
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,602
It's like a military bomb shelter.

449
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:14,812
Jesus, Jody!

450
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:16,899
Sorry.

451
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:22,696
These maps must be 20 years old.

452
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,490
Try so.

453
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:31,078
Hey, you guys, look.

454
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:39,754
- It's vintage 1925.
- Shit.

455
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:43,507
It must be worth a fortune.

456
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:47,010
Liebfraumilch.

457
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:52,098
This is German,
same as the maps.

458
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:03,735
It looks like Poland.

459
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,866
How do you know?

460
00:43:08,783 --> 00:43:11,994
My father was German.

461
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:23,463
Beans.

462
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:27,259
More beans.

463
00:43:29,928 --> 00:43:32,223
- Sausage.
- Your dad taught you well.

464
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:36,852
My mother taught me.
I actually never met my father.

465
00:43:38,937 --> 00:43:41,857
Really?

466
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:52,324
Why are you looking
at me like that?

467
00:43:52,908 --> 00:43:54,660
Nothing, it's just

468
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:58,289
I didn't think we had
anything in common until now.

469
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:02,208
What do we have in common?

470
00:44:02,751 --> 00:44:06,504
My dad died in the war too.

471
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:11,175
I'm sorry.

472
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,219
No, I mean, it happens.

473
00:44:13,344 --> 00:44:15,222
That's life, you know?

474
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:17,432
Oh, look. Cigarettes, Sam,

475
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:20,018
to kill your fetus some more.

476
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:23,021
- Cool it.
- I'm kidding.

477
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:27,776
Let's just pack up some food
and get out of here.

478
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:35,408
Tom, I can't carry all this alone.

479
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:46,170
It's impossible.

480
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:50,256
I'm starting to think
anything's possible.

481
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:54,510
No, it's...

482
00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:56,219
it's like we're trapped!

483
00:44:56,345 --> 00:44:58,806
It's like... it's like Pac-Man.

484
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,390
Pac-Man?

485
00:45:00,516 --> 00:45:02,101
Yeah, you know...

486
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:04,644
you go in one side of the board
and come out the other,

487
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,357
but it's always the same board.

488
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:13,862
How do you get
to the next level?

489
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:25,457
It can't be.

490
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:47,854
Tomorrow we're gonna
have to split up,

491
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,772
go in separate directions,
try to get out of here.

492
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:51,899
No fucking way.
That is the worst thing

493
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:56,447
we could do at this moment.
Besides where is here?

494
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:59,782
I don't know.

495
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:03,162
No one's out there
looking for me anyway.

496
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:05,289
Nobody?

497
00:46:05,414 --> 00:46:08,500
- Nobody.
- Why is that?

498
00:46:08,626 --> 00:46:11,670
Because I was raised
in an orphanage in South Dakota

499
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:14,632
because my mother was executed.

500
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:18,551
So like I said, nobody.

501
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:27,143
I could be dead and missing
and no one would even notice.

502
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:31,231
- That is not true.
- Thank you, Sam, but it's true.

503
00:46:31,357 --> 00:46:34,818
So you were headed home.

504
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:36,318
It doesn't matter
where I was headed.

505
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:39,447
Well, it might be helpful.

506
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,075
I was headed back to the orphanage
where I was raised.

507
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,452
- Why?
- To visit an old friend.

508
00:46:44,577 --> 00:46:47,705
Can we change
the subject, please?

509
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,957
I'd like to say grace.

510
00:46:50,082 --> 00:46:52,376
Sorry, I'm an atheist.

511
00:46:52,502 --> 00:46:54,421
I'm willing to try
anything at this point.

512
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:57,463
I'll make it quick.

513
00:46:58,299 --> 00:47:01,468
Okay.

514
00:47:14,314 --> 00:47:17,608
Damn, it's freezing out here.

515
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:21,362
Here, take a swig of this,
it'll warm you up.

516
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:28,744
I think we were
abducted by aliens.

517
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:30,246
What?

518
00:47:30,372 --> 00:47:33,165
Yeah. I think we were
abducted by aliens,

519
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,167
taken on a space ship,
knocked out

520
00:47:35,293 --> 00:47:38,880
and then dropped somewhere
in the mountains.

521
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:41,882
It could have happened
while I was sleeping in my car.

522
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:45,218
Yeah, we could be near Area 51.

523
00:47:45,343 --> 00:47:47,054
Let's stop with the aliens.

524
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:48,639
But, Tom,

525
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:52,310
you kinda look like an alien.

526
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:54,771
Very funny.

527
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:58,482
Laugh it up.

528
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:02,527
Aliens.

529
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:23,632
Where are you going?

530
00:48:24,758 --> 00:48:27,678
Nature calls, ladies.

531
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:38,354
Can I see it?

532
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,152
The money? I don't think
I've ever seen that much before.

533
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:00,334
How?

534
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,629
You really wanna know?

535
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,639
I rob gas stations
with my boyfriend.

536
00:49:12,764 --> 00:49:14,141
Really?

537
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:16,517
Hardware stores, delis...

538
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:17,728
whoever seems harmless.

539
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:19,978
Sometimes we'll get a Kmart

540
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:23,191
just to rob somebody corporate.

541
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:26,777
Nice try.

542
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:29,654
Let me tell you something, Sam.

543
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:32,032
I don't lie.

544
00:49:32,158 --> 00:49:34,328
Not about what state I'm in

545
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:37,663
or how I get by.
I don't lie.

546
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:40,207
Got me?

547
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,835
I ain't no precious
little Catholic schoolgirl,

548
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:46,254
I ain't been privileged enough
to afford college

549
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,924
or whatever else
people expect of me.

550
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:51,510
So I rob people.

551
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:55,013
You understand?

552
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,977
Yeah.

553
00:50:10,862 --> 00:50:13,115
This isn't even real.

554
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,658
What are you talking about?
Of course it's real.

555
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:18,036
It says it was printed in 1984.

556
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,120
What did you rob, a gag store?

557
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:22,207
What exactly is the gag?

558
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:25,042
I've never heard
of the treasury

559
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:28,838
printing money from the future,
have you?

560
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:37,138
What?

561
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:50,525
Samantha,

562
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:53,321
what war did
your father die in?

563
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:56,448
World War ll of course.

564
00:50:56,574 --> 00:51:00,453
He was killed
in a massive air-strike.

565
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:03,956
Okay, Sam, I'm gonna
ask you a question, okay?

566
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:08,543
And I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

567
00:51:09,545 --> 00:51:13,923
What year do you think it is?

568
00:51:14,257 --> 00:51:17,845
1962.

569
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:22,807
What year do you think it is?

570
00:51:33,442 --> 00:51:36,153
Holy shit.

571
00:51:39,198 --> 00:51:41,784
It's freezing out there.

572
00:51:45,288 --> 00:51:48,249
What year does this say?

573
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:52,503
1931.

574
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:55,506
And this one?

575
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,967
- 1932?
- Doesn't it strike you as odd

576
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:01,388
- how old they are?
- No, not really.

577
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:03,638
That bomb shelter could have
been locked up for years.

578
00:52:03,764 --> 00:52:05,640
How many years?

579
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:09,562
Who knows?
What's going on?

580
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:12,565
- Tom, what year is it?
- I just told you.

581
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:14,566
No, not the bottle,
but the year now!

582
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:16,653
What year is it now?

583
00:52:16,777 --> 00:52:19,654
2011.

584
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:22,158
Would someone tell me
what's going on?

585
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:24,869
Okay, last time
I checked it was 1985

586
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:26,913
and Samantha thinks
that it's 1962.

587
00:52:27,037 --> 00:52:28,997
I don't think it's 1962.
I know it is!

588
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:32,668
- This is a joke, right?
- No, believe it.

589
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:44,346
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I've heard it before.

590
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:46,015
- You have?
- Yeah.

591
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,850
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I don't know.

592
00:52:47,975 --> 00:52:50,727
Well, maybe it's a hunter.

593
00:52:58,526 --> 00:53:01,572
Oh, my God,
there's someone out there.

594
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:06,533
Shit, it's Michael Myers.

595
00:53:06,658 --> 00:53:08,994
You know him?

596
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,373
Not this shit again.
Tom, what do we do?

597
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,752
Stay here.

598
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,714
Hey, sir,
we're stranded out here.

599
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:22,632
Sir.

600
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:30,766
- What?
- It's German.

601
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:35,103
- What's he saying?
- I don't know. He's speaking too fast.

602
00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:37,938
Drop the axe, Tom.

603
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:40,191
Hey, man, look,
we're not gonna hurt you.

604
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:43,153
I don't think he's scared of you.

605
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:48,616
Samantha,
say something, anything.

606
00:53:48,784 --> 00:53:53,580
We are not armed.

607
00:53:55,916 --> 00:54:00,587
I don't think
he's search and rescue.

608
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:27,279
Are you okay?

609
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:29,907
Yeah.

610
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:32,493
You?

611
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:36,955
- We're fine.
- Yeah, fine and dandy.

612
00:54:37,122 --> 00:54:38,748
Where did he go?

613
00:54:38,874 --> 00:54:40,960
I don't know.
He was trying to fix the radio.

614
00:54:41,084 --> 00:54:42,961
He's been gone all morning.

615
00:54:43,086 --> 00:54:45,464
- I think he has anger issues.
- What does he want?

616
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:48,135
Maybe he lives here.

617
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:50,303
No.

618
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:53,598
No one lives here.

619
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:58,310
Ham radio,

620
00:54:58,435 --> 00:55:00,646
vintage wine, bomb shelter,

621
00:55:00,771 --> 00:55:02,815
psycho German dude.

622
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:06,151
Holy shit.

623
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:08,778
What?

624
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:11,407
I think...

625
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:14,327
I think we're in
another time period.

626
00:55:14,451 --> 00:55:17,204
His time period.
What, the '30s?

627
00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:20,957
'40s maybe.
World War ll?

628
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:25,003
Yeah, I mean that would
explain the bomb shelter.

629
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:29,675
Tom, do you have
time travel in 2011?

630
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,385
Did... did you bring us here?

631
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:36,096
I know 2011 sounds like
a long way off,

632
00:55:36,222 --> 00:55:38,684
but we're nowhere near
that advanced yet.

633
00:55:38,808 --> 00:55:41,145
We haven't even been back
to the moon since the '60s.

634
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,063
We go to the moon?

635
00:55:43,188 --> 00:55:44,189
Supposedly.

636
00:55:44,314 --> 00:55:45,982
You don't think
we went to the moon?

637
00:55:46,107 --> 00:55:48,652
Oh, and I suppose Elvis
is still alive

638
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:50,528
and no one shot JFK, right?

639
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:55,032
Somebody shoots JFK?

640
00:55:55,158 --> 00:55:56,659
Oh, my God.

641
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:58,744
Maybe we shouldn't
talk about the future.

642
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,622
Easy for you to say, Tom. You know
everything that's going to happen.

643
00:56:01,747 --> 00:56:04,542
Do I? I sure as hell don't know
what this guy is capable of.

644
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,544
He's psychotic.

645
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:09,715
He's afraid.

646
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,800
Even worse.

647
00:56:17,012 --> 00:56:21,683
Shit, he's coming.
It's been nice knowing you guys.

648
00:56:28,188 --> 00:56:30,024
Get away from him, asshole!

649
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,986
What are you gonna do?

650
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:44,372
What do you want?

651
00:56:44,498 --> 00:56:46,290
Tom!

652
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:49,419
Leave him alone!

653
00:56:55,968 --> 00:56:58,094
Do you understand English?

654
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,430
English!

655
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:03,016
Peaceful.

656
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:06,561
What are you, a Nazi?

657
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:13,734
Please,

658
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:19,364
whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't! Please!

659
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:45,682
Halt!

660
00:57:53,859 --> 00:57:56,945
Shit!

661
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:59,404
Jody, Sam!

662
00:57:59,528 --> 00:58:02,866
Can you hear me?

663
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:35,731
He's a fucking Nazi.

664
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,912
I'm pregnant.

665
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:52,207
What are you doing here?

666
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:53,874
You're an American?

667
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:57,212
I don't...

668
00:58:57,337 --> 00:58:58,545
What are you doing here?

669
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,757
Leave her alone.
Tell him I'm hungry.

670
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:07,429
She is hungry.
We are all hungry.

671
00:59:07,555 --> 00:59:12,310
Really? Hungry?

672
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:23,611
Who are you?

673
00:59:23,778 --> 00:59:27,365
Who are you?

674
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:42,796
Where did you get this?

675
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,631
He wants to know
about your necklace.

676
00:59:44,757 --> 00:59:46,967
It was my mother's.

677
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:48,887
It was her mother's.

678
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:51,095
No!

679
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:56,225
You have three seconds
to tell me where you got it.

680
00:59:56,352 --> 00:59:57,437
One.

681
00:59:57,562 --> 00:59:59,898
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

682
01:00:00,022 --> 01:00:01,649
Two!

683
01:00:01,774 --> 01:00:02,775
Three!

684
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:06,279
I have the same necklace!

685
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:19,499
Where did you get this?

686
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:22,586
- It can't be.
- What?

687
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,965
It's my mother.

688
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:37,559
Tom, do you have a locket?

689
01:00:37,685 --> 01:00:39,894
- A what?
- A locket, a locket like this one.

690
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:41,647
No, why?

691
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,815
I don't know what's going on,

692
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,483
but if you have a locket,

693
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:49,904
you need to tell him right now
before he does something terrible.

694
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,205
You all have the same locket?

695
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,833
Well, isn't that just beautiful?

696
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,211
Welcome to our nightmare.

697
01:01:05,337 --> 01:01:08,131
You know if you put your gun down
for more than two seconds,

698
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:10,382
maybe we could figure
this whole thing out.

699
01:01:10,508 --> 01:01:14,262
But I guess that's just not
in your vocabulary, is it?

700
01:01:16,265 --> 01:01:18,516
I can't translate all that.

701
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:21,353
I don't give a fuck
if he understands or not.

702
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:26,483
Well, what do you
want me to tell him?

703
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:31,112
Tell him I know
something he doesn't.

704
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:39,328
What do you know?

705
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,541
How to untie a slipknot.

706
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:56,053
So who's the woman in the picture?

707
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:59,598
My mother.

708
01:02:00,056 --> 01:02:03,227
My grandmother.

709
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,480
And my father's name
was Hans Neumann.

710
01:02:09,149 --> 01:02:12,612
No fucking way.

711
01:02:24,288 --> 01:02:27,332
What is your birthday?

712
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:31,503
- I don't want to answer that question.
- Tell me the date.

713
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:36,425
November 11th, 1962.

714
01:02:37,552 --> 01:02:39,886
That's when my baby is due.

715
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:44,099
Your last name is Cohen.

716
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:50,272
Your father is Adam Cohen, right?

717
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:52,107
It was his parents who raised you?

718
01:02:52,232 --> 01:02:55,110
Yes.

719
01:02:55,235 --> 01:02:59,865
So he dies in the war?

720
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:18,466
We're all related.

721
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,387
Don't try passing it off
like I'm your mother, Tom.

722
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:26,140
- Because that's bullshit.
- Believe it.

723
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:28,435
Fuck that!

724
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,355
I ain't no mother.

725
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,524
You don't even have a locket.

726
01:03:34,649 --> 01:03:38,778
I did have a locket.
I just never kept it.

727
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:42,322
No, you see now you're just
saying things just to say them.

728
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:44,826
See, I'm not pregnant

729
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,994
and I never even plan to be, ever.

730
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,163
Maybe not now,
but definitely this year.

731
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:52,500
No, I vowed never
to have children!

732
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:56,046
I want nothing to do
with them, ever.

733
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:59,631
Yeah, I noticed
when I was four days old

734
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:01,675
and I was put up for adoption.

735
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:04,011
It wasn't me, Tom.
It wasn't me.

736
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:07,182
I know it wasn't you.
It was the State of South Dakota.

737
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:08,599
What are you talking about?

738
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:11,852
My real mother was put to death
for murder and armed robbery.

739
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:15,313
She was robbing liquor stores
and gas stations all over the Midwest.

740
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:20,487
She shot a cashier. She also shot
and killed my father, Kevin Banks.

741
01:04:20,612 --> 01:04:22,447
- No, you're lying.
- Am I?

742
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:26,742
Because I was born in South Dakota
Women's Prison on December 12, 1985,

743
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:29,619
eight months before
she was executed.

744
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:33,207
And the only thing she left me with
was a box of her junk,

745
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:35,251
including a tiny silver locket

746
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,586
that looked just like this.

747
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:42,090
So you tell me, Jody. You look me in
the eyes and you tell me if I'm lying.

748
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:00,901
You said

749
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:04,821
that your mother died in childbirth?

750
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:07,574
And Adam?

751
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:11,870
Your father?

752
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,750
He was killed in Vietnam.

753
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:19,753
I'm sorry.

754
01:05:19,877 --> 01:05:22,215
What happened to you?

755
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:25,257
I went to go live with Adam's family

756
01:05:25,381 --> 01:05:28,676
since you didn't have any.

757
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:33,765
They hated me and I have
the scars to prove it.

758
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:40,314
- Did he...
- Yeah, Adam's dad was a drinker.

759
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:45,235
And they weren't really
big fans of you either.

760
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:49,197
I know.

761
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:53,869
I hated them for that...

762
01:05:53,994 --> 01:05:58,915
every day growing up without
even a picture of my mother.

763
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:01,750
So I always kept
the locket close

764
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:04,922
and I never did find out
what happened to her.

765
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:08,383
Your grandmother?

766
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:12,929
She married an American.

767
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:18,184
They were killed
in a car accident a few years ago.

768
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:28,861
I'm sorry.

769
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:56,640
You starting to get the idea
of what's going on around here?

770
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:03,938
You know, you could help us
figure this whole thing out.

771
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:07,816
What does this all mean?

772
01:07:08,151 --> 01:07:10,528
The cabin, the bomb shelter,

773
01:07:10,653 --> 01:07:14,031
all this shit?

774
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:22,080
Fine, suit yourself.

775
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:32,757
I need five minutes with him.

776
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:37,596
Five minutes.

777
01:07:50,193 --> 01:07:53,612
It's been five minutes.

778
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,578
What are you doing?

779
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,080
It's okay.
I explained everything to him.

780
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:06,165
You can't untie him. He's nuts.

781
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,916
No, I won't have him tied up.

782
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:09,918
He doesn't think
we're related, okay?

783
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,798
- He thinks we're all crazy.
- He is my father!

784
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:17,385
Please.

785
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:20,972
Trust me.

786
01:08:31,188 --> 01:08:35,610
I'm untying you because I believe

787
01:08:35,734 --> 01:08:41,159
that you, Hans Neumann,
are my father,

788
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:47,580
and that I am your daughter.

789
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,918
I'm going to trust you,

790
01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:57,340
and I can only hope
that you learn to trust us too.

791
01:09:49,641 --> 01:09:52,101
What the fuck?
You're just letting him get away.

792
01:09:52,227 --> 01:09:56,231
I don't think he'll get very far.

793
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:03,363
My husband is in the army.

794
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:05,825
He's overseas.

795
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:07,701
I'm all alone.

796
01:10:07,827 --> 01:10:11,746
There's something wrong
with my baby.

797
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:14,457
You should know that I dreamt it.

798
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:15,917
You dreamt what?

799
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:20,420
I dreamt I died in childbirth.

800
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:24,552
I was all alone because
Adam was overseas.

801
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:29,513
The ambulance didn't
make it in time.

802
01:10:34,019 --> 01:10:35,894
I had a dream too.

803
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:37,606
What kind of dream?

804
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:41,567
About a priest who wronged me.

805
01:10:42,693 --> 01:10:45,571
I shot him,

806
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:49,326
then I shot myself.

807
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,419
I dreamt that
I was being executed

808
01:10:58,543 --> 01:11:01,420
for murdering Kevin.

809
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:04,214
We all dreamt our death.

810
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,550
No,

811
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:10,388
we all dreamt our futures.

812
01:11:11,221 --> 01:11:13,683
None of this has happened yet.

813
01:11:13,807 --> 01:11:17,188
We can change it.
We can stop it.

814
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,982
That's gotta be
a reason why we're here.

815
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:26,612
Samantha, didn't you say your dad
was killed during an air-strike?

816
01:11:27,738 --> 01:11:30,491
What were the circumstances
regarding his death?

817
01:11:30,617 --> 01:11:32,910
He was killed

818
01:11:33,036 --> 01:11:34,744
when he lost contact
with his unit.

819
01:11:34,868 --> 01:11:37,078
He was supposed to be
locating rebels on the border.

820
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:40,791
- That's all I know.
- Okay, so where did your father die?

821
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:43,419
In Wielun.

822
01:11:43,545 --> 01:11:46,923
This is the cabin
and this is the bomb shelter.

823
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:50,468
It's on the edge
of the bubble, right here.

824
01:11:50,802 --> 01:11:54,138
If we're here,
then today's the day.

825
01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:57,350
And we're all about to die.

826
01:12:00,978 --> 01:12:02,563
Maybe we're all about to live.

827
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:05,191
What do you mean?

828
01:12:05,316 --> 01:12:07,901
Hear me out.

829
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:10,362
For whatever reason,

830
01:12:10,488 --> 01:12:12,824
we have a chance
to make sure he doesn't die.

831
01:12:12,949 --> 01:12:16,035
If he lives, then your mother
will never remarry.

832
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,704
And if she never remarries,

833
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:22,166
maybe she's with you
while Adam's over in Vietnam.

834
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:26,253
She drives you to the hospital.
You don't die during childbirth.

835
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:29,714
That would mean
Jody grows up with a mother.

836
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:34,051
Maybe she doesn't
turn out so bad after all.

837
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,765
Maybe I grow up
with a real mother.

838
01:12:42,978 --> 01:12:44,647
It's a stretch.

839
01:12:44,771 --> 01:12:46,981
It's all I've got.

840
01:12:47,107 --> 01:12:49,609
Yeah, it's also insane!

841
01:12:54,071 --> 01:12:56,408
- Jody?
- What?

842
01:12:56,533 --> 01:12:59,368
Your scar.

843
01:12:59,494 --> 01:13:02,372
What about it?

844
01:13:06,877 --> 01:13:08,337
It's gone.

845
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:10,172
We're changing things.

846
01:13:10,296 --> 01:13:13,173
We have to make sure
Hans is in the bomb shelter

847
01:13:13,299 --> 01:13:17,304
- when the air-strike happens.
- Yeah.

848
01:13:18,763 --> 01:13:21,850
Fuck it. I'm in.

849
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,106
Hans?

850
01:13:29,483 --> 01:13:30,900
We're on your side.

851
01:13:31,025 --> 01:13:32,903
Don't come any closer.

852
01:13:33,027 --> 01:13:35,280
I don't want to hurt any of you.

853
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:38,866
Let me go,
so I can follow my orders.

854
01:13:38,992 --> 01:13:41,536
He says he must follow his orders.

855
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:49,126
Fuck the mission, Hans!

856
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:52,797
There's something bigger
happening out here.

857
01:13:55,675 --> 01:13:59,388
They think...
they think he failed his mission.

858
01:13:59,512 --> 01:14:02,557
They're going ahead
with the bombing.

859
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:05,893
Hello? Hello? Hello?

860
01:14:06,018 --> 01:14:08,729
- It's not working.
- Sam!

861
01:14:09,522 --> 01:14:12,065
Samantha!

862
01:14:13,232 --> 01:14:16,112
Tell him, tell him!

863
01:14:16,236 --> 01:14:18,446
Halt!

864
01:14:18,571 --> 01:14:21,409
Don't come any closer.

865
01:14:21,785 --> 01:14:25,162
If you go through
with your mission, you will die,

866
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:30,166
and when you die, you will be
responsible for our fates.

867
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:32,543
I must complete my mission.

868
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,463
The Germans aren't
gonna win this war.

869
01:14:34,587 --> 01:14:37,006
No, Tom.
See, maybe he's supposed to die.

870
01:14:37,131 --> 01:14:38,591
No! No, we're here to save him.

871
01:14:38,714 --> 01:14:40,343
No, Tom, that's what
you want, okay?

872
01:14:40,468 --> 01:14:43,011
Maybe this is about
something bigger... bigger than us.

873
01:14:43,136 --> 01:14:45,891
Bigger than this fucking Nazi!

874
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:52,147
He says he's not a Nazi.
He's a soldier.

875
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:54,357
Hans, you have to stay with us!

876
01:14:54,482 --> 01:14:55,857
If you don't come with us,
you're gonna die!

877
01:14:55,983 --> 01:14:58,861
Get out of my way!

878
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,872
No, Tom!

879
01:15:11,582 --> 01:15:14,460
No!

880
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:25,803
No! Jody! Oh, my God.

881
01:15:25,929 --> 01:15:28,723
Jody! Oh, my God.

882
01:15:28,848 --> 01:15:31,184
Oh, my God.

883
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,698
Shit, her scar's back.

884
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:48,743
Sam! Sam, Sam,
we need your help.

885
01:15:48,868 --> 01:15:50,495
You need to put
pressure here, okay?

886
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,581
Put your hands here.
I need your help.

887
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:57,168
- It's okay.
- You can't let her die, okay?

888
01:15:58,628 --> 01:16:01,046
If she dies,

889
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:04,342
I don't exist.

890
01:16:05,551 --> 01:16:07,471
What do you mean?

891
01:16:07,595 --> 01:16:09,973
If she dies...

892
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:13,810
You'll disappear.

893
01:16:15,018 --> 01:16:16,771
Save Hans. Save Hans.

894
01:16:16,896 --> 01:16:19,231
- I will, I will.
- Save Hans.

895
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:21,567
I'll save him.
I'll save us.

896
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:23,694
Tom, Tom, Tom.

897
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,696
If you save Hans, then then...

898
01:16:25,821 --> 01:16:28,240
then maybe neither of you will exist.

899
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:31,076
Maybe I'll never meet Adam.
Maybe... maybe...

900
01:16:31,202 --> 01:16:34,622
I know.

901
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:47,676
Oh, my God.

902
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:53,598
Hans! Hans!

903
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:03,441
Hans!

904
01:17:04,652 --> 01:17:07,487
It's okay. It's okay.

905
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:09,197
Hans!

906
01:17:09,323 --> 01:17:11,951
It's okay.

907
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:23,421
Hans!

908
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:30,594
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.

909
01:17:36,517 --> 01:17:39,852
Don't.

910
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:46,875
Pac-Man.

911
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:13,195
No, no!

912
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:16,339
You did this!
You did this!

913
01:20:16,464 --> 01:20:20,218
You killed them!
Don't you understand me?

914
01:20:25,807 --> 01:20:29,227
We have to go to the bunker.

915
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:37,443
If you die, she dies.

916
01:20:37,569 --> 01:20:41,989
My mother, your wife.

917
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:44,700
Do you understand?

918
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:51,998
Save yourself for her. For me.

919
01:20:57,671 --> 01:21:00,715
Hurry!

920
01:23:25,899 --> 01:23:29,361
Miss? Miss?

921
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:33,282
Miss?

922
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

923
01:23:35,326 --> 01:23:37,162
Here you go.

924
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:39,789
Thank you. Oh, miss,

925
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:43,749
you forgot these.

926
01:23:44,084 --> 01:23:46,294
I'm sorry. I just...

927
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,633
I feel so weird,
like I've been here before.

928
01:23:50,757 --> 01:23:54,344
This place has
that effect on people.

929
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:56,679
Do you need directions
or anything?

930
01:23:56,805 --> 01:24:01,017
Oh, no, I know where I'm going.

931
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:04,937
Have a good day.

932
01:24:54,152 --> 01:24:56,447
Come on!

933
01:24:56,571 --> 01:24:59,199
No need to yell.
I'll open it.

934
01:24:59,324 --> 01:25:01,534
No tricks up these sleeves.

935
01:25:01,658 --> 01:25:02,743
Keep it that way.

936
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:05,456
Come on, man.
Give me the fucking money!

937
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,084
Here you go, here you go.

938
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:10,752
There you go.

939
01:25:10,878 --> 01:25:13,965
The safe.

940
01:25:15,299 --> 01:25:17,593
Damn shame you're living
your life like this.

941
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:19,428
All the things
you could have done

942
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:21,512
and you're holding up
a dairy mart for pennies.

943
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:23,138
I said the safe, right now.

944
01:25:23,264 --> 01:25:25,100
I'll open it,

945
01:25:25,225 --> 01:25:29,144
but I don't think you have
the stomach for what's inside.
