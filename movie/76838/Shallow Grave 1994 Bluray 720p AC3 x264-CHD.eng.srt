1
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:31,750
I'm not ashamed. I've known love.
I've known rejection.
I'm not afraid to declare my feelings.

2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,787
Take trust, for instance, or friendship.
These are the important things in life.

3
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:42,416
These are the things that matter,
that help you on your way.

4
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:49,130
If you can't trust your friends,
well what then? What then?

5
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,966
This could have been any city.

6
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:57,428
They're all the same.

7
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:26,337
Hello. I've come about the room.

8
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:36,804
- So what's his name?
- I don't know. Campbell or something.

9
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:39,848
- Cameron.
- Cameron? Really?

10
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,392
That's right.

11
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:45,103
What?

12
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,605
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes, thanks.

13
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,899
- Have you seen the flat?
- Yes.

14
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,859
- And you like it?
- Yes, it's great.

15
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,904
We all like it. The room's nice,
too, don't you think?

16
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:59,949
Spacious, bright, all that sort of stuff,
all that sort of crap.

17
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,659
Well, yes.

18
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:05,328
So tell me, cos I'd like to know,
what on earth could make you think...

19
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,247
..we'd want to share this flat
with someone like you?

20
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:13,460
My first impression is that you have none
of the qualities we seek from a flatmate.

21
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,255
I'm talking about things like presence,
charisma, style and charm.

22
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:20,841
I don't think we're asking too much,
or being unreasonable.

23
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:25,012
Take David here. An accountant
he may be, but at least he tries hard.

24
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:28,348
Trouble is, I just don't think you're trying.

25
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:33,477
Hey, Cameron, I mean this. Good luck.

26
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:45,571
- Just a few questions.
- What about your hobbies?

27
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,823
- Why do you want a room here?
- Do you smoke?

28
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:51,868
When you sacrifice a goat and rip
its heart out, do you summon hellfire?

29
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:56,038
It's a straightforward question.
Either you're divorced or you're not.

30
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,916
- Or do you just send out for a pizza?
- Do a little freebase, maybe?

31
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,752
How do you decide
which shade of black to wear?

32
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:06,255
OK, I'm going to play you
just a few seconds of this tape.

33
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,840
Name the song, the lead singer,...

34
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:16,555
..and three hit singles subsequently
recorded by him with another band.

35
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:27,481
Let me get this straight.
This affair that you're "not" having,...

36
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,025
..is it not with a man
or not with a woman?

37
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,736
Turning very briefly
to corporate financing...

38
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:37,281
No, this is important. Leveraged buyouts:
a good or a bad thing?

39
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:40,159
When did anyone last
say to you these exact words:

40
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:44,204
"You are the sunshine of my life"?

41
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:50,000
And how would you react, then,
if I told you I was the Antichrist?

42
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,590
Do you like my picture?

43
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,976
Defeat. Defeat. Defeat.

44
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:16,648
Sporting, personal, financial,
professional, sexual and everything.

45
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:20,735
Next.

46
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:28,867
- Did you know that...?
- Alex. Just serve.

47
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:35,747
Anyway, I wasn't tryin' to win. I
don't want to devalue your victory, Juliet.

48
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:39,125
- I wasn't tryin' to win.
- Victory's the same as defeat.

49
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,294
It's giving in to destructive urges.

50
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:44,255
Did you learn that in
your psychotherapy group?

51
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,466
- Discussion group.
- I thought you'd stopped going.

52
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:52,303
He had too many of those urges.
You of all people should know about that.

53
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,764
God, you two are sensitive.

54
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:58,934
All I'm doing is implying some
kind of ugly, sordid, sexual liaison.

55
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,770
- I'd be proud of that.
- Maybe you should go.

56
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,605
- You'll meet someone wonderful.
- For my life?

57
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:08,108
- A discussion group? I think not.
- For the flat.

58
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:12,112
No, it'd be someone like him,
and one's enough, thank you very much.

59
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:16,407
What about that girl? That friend of yours,
the one that came round. I liked her.

60
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:19,993
We had something. She could have
moved in. We had chemistry.

61
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:22,162
- She hated you...
- She had problems.

62
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:27,041
..more than anyone
she had ever met in her entire life.

63
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,878
Like they say, you know, she's
got to want to change, hasn't she?

64
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:44,848
- You must be Hugo.
- And you must be Juliet.

65
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:50,019
- Would you like to come in?
- I'd be delighted.

66
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,651
- What do you do?
- I've been away for a while.

67
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,779
Travelling. And now I'm writing a novel.

68
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:02,905
Oh.

69
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:07,951
- What's it about?
- It's actually about a priest who dies.

70
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,161
I see.

71
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:13,747
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ought to change it. You're right.

72
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:17,334
I mean, who wants to read
another story about a dead priest?

73
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:21,796
In fact, it's about another guy,
he's not a priest, and he lives.

74
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:25,799
He doesn't die. See? It's better already.

75
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:29,010
- Writing seems easy.
- It's a breeze. No problem.

76
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:42,063
Do you think you could answer that?

77
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:47,609
- What, the telephone?
- But... if it's for me, I'm not here.

78
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:51,905
Right. You're not here.

79
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:56,742
OK.

80
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:04,248
Hello?

81
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:09,127
Yes, it is, yes. Who's calling, please?

82
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:14,799
Well, I'm sorry, but she's not...
she's not in right now.

83
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:18,594
No, I've got absolutely no idea.

84
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:21,596
Would you like to leave a message?

85
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:25,433
OK. Goodbye.

86
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:30,646
That was, um... a guy called Brian.

87
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:33,690
- Did he sound upset?
- A little bit, yeah.

88
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,651
- Is that good or bad?
- It's an improvement.

89
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:39,361
- Shall I get the phone?

90
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:43,532
Just leave it. He knows I'm probably
at home. I'm working nights this week.

91
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,492
- You're working nights?
- I'm a doctor.

92
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:47,493
Ah.

93
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:52,539
- And he's a patient?
- No, but he needs treatment.

94
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:55,125
- For what?
- A certain weakness.

95
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,003
- The human condition.
- Oh. You know about it.

96
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:03,966
- Well, I write about it.
- And that's not the same thing?

97
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:07,886
No. I'm like all novelists -
on a search of the self.

98
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:10,638
Has he tried
down the back of the fridge?

99
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:13,057
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

100
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:16,101
I'm not saying
he didn't seem like a nice guy.

101
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,937
I just said it's a bit strange,
this search of the self or whatever.

102
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,565
He didn't seem strange, Alex.

103
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:28,236
He seemed... you know,...

104
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:32,448
- ..interesting.
- Interesting?

105
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,663
- Interesting.

106
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,962
Hello? No, she's not in.

107
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:51,714
I don't know. I've no idea.

108
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:54,383
- Who was it?
- I don't know. He sounded Swedish.

109
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:57,970
- Do you know any Swedish men?
- No.

110
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,347
Maybe it was just the emotion.

111
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:02,849
- What do you think?
- About what?

112
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,643
- About this Hugo person.
- I don't have the time.

113
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:09,646
- I'm just asking what you think.
- I don't care, so long as he's not a freak.

114
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:13,316
David. It's your mother's
handwriting. I didn't open it.

115
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:17,069
I don't like reading about
your father's constipation.

116
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,239
- So we'll meet him, then?
- What?

117
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:25,868
Yeah, yeah, whatever. I tell you, every
letter this guy writes you is the same.

118
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,496
They all begin like true love
and descend into open pornography.

119
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:33,708
"I dream of your thighs, the touch of
your white skin leading me in desire,...

120
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,964
..while I, aroused and inflamed..."
Aroused and inflamed?

121
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,761
He even signs them in his own name.

122
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:52,141
I'd sign someone else's. I'd sign his name.
If I wrote them, that is, which I don't.

123
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,768
Interesting. That's what she said.

124
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:57,478
Interesting. You see,
that's why you're here.

125
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:00,731
I don't usually meet people,
unless I already know them.

126
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,400
- I see.
- People can be so cruel.

127
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,861
So, um...

128
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,072
..well, we think it's fine.

129
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:11,407
Ah. So, I can have the room?

130
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:14,785
- Yes, you can have the room.
- I'm not usually drunk.

131
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:18,246
- Not usually this drunk.
- Only on expenses.

132
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:21,165
He's going to tell you
he could have been someone.

133
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:25,127
Instead of what he is, which is
the man we know and love.

134
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:29,464
..tired out, empty shell of a...
Know and love?

135
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:32,592
- I think you're lying.
- You're right.

136
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:39,431
- You see? They don't really know me.
- No, Alex. We don't really love you.

137
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:43,434
Can you afford this place?

138
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:47,271
Oh, yeah.

139
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,528
- Can I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

140
00:11:56,195 --> 00:12:00,157
Have you ever killed a man?

141
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,330
No.

142
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,670
That's fair enough, then.

143
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:28,931
Well, it certainly smells like the real thing.

144
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:39,199
Rangers have made a few
dramatic comebacks this season.

145
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:45,496
But they'll really have to
draw on all of their resources.

146
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:51,751
- Have you seen Hugo?
- No.

147
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,629
Any idea which channel he's on?

148
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,173
..the High Court in Edinburgh.

149
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:01,176
Oh, for fuck's sake.

150
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,893
No, she's not in.

151
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,819
- Have you seen him?
- I don't have the time.

152
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:27,698
- Yes or no? David, yes or...?
- No!

153
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,369
- David hasn't seen him either.
- So I gathered.

154
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,287
- Maybe he didn't like us.
- David?

155
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:37,915
- No, Hugo.
- His car's still there.

156
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:41,460
- He's got a car?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

157
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,504
- What sort of car?
- I don't know, Alex. I'm just a girl.

158
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:46,881
I'll ask you once more. What sort of car?

159
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:51,844
A blue one, OK? And it's still there.

160
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,358
Hugo, I'm sorry about this,
but can you open your door?

161
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:14,196
It's us, your flatmates and companions,
your new-found friends.

162
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:18,199
- He's not there. I can't see him at all.
- Maybe he's in the wardrobe.

163
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,618
Of course he's not
in the bloody wardrobe.

164
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:24,204
- It's a joke, Alex.
- I think he probably left.

165
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:29,542
- We'll probably never see him again.
- Alex, the key is on the other side.

166
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,420
- So?
- Open it.

167
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,588
You want me to kick this in? Now?

168
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,633
- Yeah.
- OK, no problem.

169
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:50,101
Do you want a go?

170
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:55,064
OK, you size that up.

171
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:23,296
- Is this what they always look like?
- Yes.

172
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,841
- Wonder how he did it.
- Did what?

173
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:32,095
Killed himself.
I presume that's what's happened.

174
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,264
What do you think?

175
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:37,100
- Alex!
- What? What's wrong?

176
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,185
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

177
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,020
- Don't.
- Don't look?

178
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,313
- No.
- Why not?

179
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:46,107
What's wrong? Don't you
wonder what he died from?

180
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:51,070
No. The guy's dead.
What more do you need?

181
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,990
It's not every day
I find a story in my own flat.

182
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,077
It's not a story, Alex, it's a corpse.

183
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:06,458
I've never seen a dead body before.

184
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,385
I saw my grandmother, of course,
but I don't suppose that counts.

185
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:22,305
She was alive at the time.

186
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:42,238
Can I show you something?

187
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,374
Emergency. Which service?

188
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:59,086
Emergency. Which... ?

189
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,633
- No.
- Just think about it.

190
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,968
- No.
- Come on, David.

191
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,470
- No.
- Juliet?

192
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:13,598
- No, Alex. It's...
- It's what?

193
00:18:13,848 --> 00:18:15,558
- Unfeasible.
- Is that all?

194
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,060
- You mean immoral.
- I know what I mean.

195
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,647
- I'm only asking you to think about it.
- It's a sick idea, Alex. It's sick.

196
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:26,567
But don't tell me you're not tempted.
Don't tell me you're not interested.

197
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:30,696
- I know you well enough.
- You think so?

198
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:39,578
Go ahead, then. Telephone.

199
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,749
Telephone the police.

200
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,292
Go ahead. No one's gonna
stand in your way.

201
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,628
Telephone them. Tell them.

202
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:55,383
Tell them there's a suitcase full
of money, and you don't want it.

203
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:24,825
# My baby don't care for shows

204
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:29,871
# My baby don't care for clothes

205
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,167
# My baby just cares for me

206
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:41,297
# My baby don't care for

207
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,092
# Cars and races

208
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:49,221
# My baby don't care for

209
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:53,433
# High-tone places

210
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:57,978
# Liz Taylor is not his style

211
00:19:58,228 --> 00:20:00,856
Was there a pet
in the house? Yeah, a pet.

212
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:05,359
You know, like a dog or a budgie
or a gerbil or something?

213
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:12,365
What I need here is "PC Plod saves Harry
the Hamster from house of horror".

214
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,745
All right. Well, that's a pity.
You see, no pets - no human angle.

215
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:24,125
# My baby just cares for me

216
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,884
- Hi, there. What happened to that guy?
- What guy?

217
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:36,094
That guy. The one that died.

218
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:37,970
- Died?
- That one last week.

219
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:40,848
- Here?
- Yes, here. Where else?

220
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,975
Oh, him. Well, he died.

221
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,894
That's what I thought.

222
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:51,065
Hello? Have you got room
for an overnighter?

223
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,866
# My baby don't care

224
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:06,161
# For cars and races

225
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:10,248
# Baby don't care for

226
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:13,375
# He don't care for high-tone places

227
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:18,963
# And Liz Taylor is not his style

228
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:23,050
- He's still here?
- Yeah, he couldn't get his car started.

229
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,427
When are you gonna let the police know?

230
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:28,722
You phone them if you want, David.

231
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:34,352
- What about you?
- I'm getting used to having him around.

232
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:39,064
# With baby

233
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:42,817
# My baby just cares for

234
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:46,904
# My baby just cares for

235
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:53,117
# My baby just cares for me #

236
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,455
What is it we do here, David?

237
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:00,457
- Sorry?
- Here.

238
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:04,127
- Right here?
- In this firm.

239
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:08,005
- Well, it's a wide range of...
- Accounting, David.

240
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:13,176
Chartered accounting is of ten sneered at.
Were you aware of that?

241
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:17,346
- Not any real sneering as such, no.
- There's a whole wide world out there,...

242
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,599
..and it all needs to be
accounted for, does it not?

243
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,393
- Well, I...
- They sneer, do they not?

244
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,812
- I'm not sure.
- It's unfashionable.

245
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:29,482
But yes, we're methodical,
yes, we're diligent, yes, we're serious.

246
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:33,276
And where's the crime in that?
Why not shout it from the rooftops?

247
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:37,989
Maybe sometimes we're a wee bit boring,
but, by God, we get the job done.

248
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:42,826
- Yes, sir.
- That's why I think you fit in here.

249
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:46,246
- I'm boring?
- You get the job done.

250
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:53,252
- I see. I thought you meant...
- Which is why I trust you with this client.

251
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,071
Good morning. Can I help you?

252
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,200
Yeah, I'll just check that for you.

253
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:54,554
Let's do it.

254
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:58,557
Let's talk about disposal.
We have to make that body unidentifiable.

255
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:02,102
Burning, dumping at sea
and burial are all flawed,...

256
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:06,105
..either by fingerprints or more commonly
by dental records, I have learnt.

257
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:08,983
What I suggest is that
we bury him out in the forest.

258
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:12,569
First we remove his hands
and his feet, which we incinerate.

259
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:16,697
And his teeth, which we just
remove. It's as simple as that.

260
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:19,491
David.

261
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:24,120
I've always wondered
what these were for. Now...

262
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:25,872
Oh.

263
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,457
This is what we need.

264
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,043
And, um...

265
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,420
..this.

266
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,130
- What else?
- I don't know.

267
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,006
A spade. We need a spade.

268
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:40,009
I wish you'd concentrate.
We need a spade to dig a pit.

269
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,011
- Who's gonna do it?
- Dig the pit?

270
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,137
- Not that.
- Who's gonna do what?

271
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:48,308
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Do I? What are you talking about?

272
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,644
- You know what. Who's gonna do it?
- We all are, David.

273
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:56,022
We're all gonna do it. You, me and Juliet
will do his or her bit. Fair enough?

274
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:58,274
- I can't do it.
- I don't hear this.

275
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,694
- I won't be able to do it.
- You want out already?

276
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,947
You don't want the money?
Hugo is going off! He smells!

277
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:11,744
- The flat smells! We can't wait!
- I won't be able to cut him up.

278
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:29,676
- Who's going to do it?
- I thought we all were.

279
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:32,970
- I don't think I can.
- But, Juliet, you're a doctor.

280
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:38,350
- You kill people every day.
- That's different. I still don't want to.

281
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,604
Now you tell me.

282
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:05,706
There's something I want to ask.

283
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:10,419
I don't know! I swear to God, I don't know!

284
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:14,214
Family? Friends?

285
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:18,634
Drugged-up, wandering, suicidal
fuck-ups don't have families.

286
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:23,680
- I just thought we should discuss it.
- Take his legs.

287
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:30,769
Where's Hugo?

288
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,606
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

289
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:27,901
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

290
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:34,073
I swear to God, I don't know! I don't know!

291
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,285
Stupid fuckin' bastard.

292
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,002
Why don't we draw lots for it?

293
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:42,506
Whoever draws the short straw does it all.
That way you either do it or you don't.

294
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,133
- OK. I can go with that.
- David?

295
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:49,053
- I don't know.
- If I draw the short straw, I'll do it.

296
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:54,933
But I'm not gonna do it
just because you won't.

297
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:37,136
All right, then. Here we are and this is it.

298
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:41,639
Do you wanna play or not?

299
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:21,340
I can't do it.

300
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:06,253
- Finished.
- All right, but not quite.

301
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:09,255
- Is that going to be deep enough?
- Don't worry.

302
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:15,052
- Is this necessary?
- Yes. Now come on. All or nothin'.

303
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:05,428
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. I'm fine, thanks. Just fine.

304
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:09,890
- Would you like to talk about it?
- No.

305
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:33,410
These three people
get their chance to...

306
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,664
..lose a million.

307
00:32:57,013 --> 00:33:01,767
Yes, all right. Hello there and welcome
aboard our millionaire's yacht.

308
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:05,896
It's just like the "Marie Celeste"
but without the party atmosphere.

309
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:10,066
As you know, the object is not
to win the game, but to...

310
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,943
Lose.

311
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:14,612
Not to give right answers, but...

312
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:17,906
- Wrong ones.
- Not to do well, but to do really...

313
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,241
Badly.

314
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:25,788
And above all to try
and make a total... hotchpotch.

315
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:37,047
Be careful.

316
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:58,023
Alex!

317
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:07,323
I don't know why we couldn't
stuff it under the floorboards.

318
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:13,411
- Stop nagging, Alex.
- We could have hid it in the fridge.

319
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:33,271
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please?

320
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:36,023
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight,...

321
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:41,778
..to help us raise funds
for the sick children's unit.

322
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:45,072
You never told me this was for children.
I hate children.

323
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:51,828
I'd raise money to have the little fuckers
put down. I want my money back!

324
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:54,205
But before the dancing starts...

325
00:35:54,455 --> 00:35:57,458
- Excuse me!
- ..I would like to give a vote of thanks...

326
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:03,755
..to the few people who have worked
so hard to make this occasion happen.

327
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:06,674
- Do you know these people?
- They're my friends.

328
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:11,178
Oh, so if they want to speak to you,
we tell them that you're not here?

329
00:36:11,428 --> 00:36:18,684
But ladies and gentlemen and those
of you who are neither or both...

330
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:24,481
- Where did they dig him up?
- Form sets for "Strip the Willow".

331
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,612
- Are we going to dance?
- Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?

332
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:50,095
OK.

333
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,013
Talk to me.

334
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:54,015
Talk to me.

335
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:03,190
- OK.
- No! Don't! Please don't!

336
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:08,694
No! No!

337
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:12,531
Please!

338
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,171
- Can we talk about something?
- Not now. I have an idea.

339
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:36,468
- It's important. We need to decide...
- Will you just stop worrying?

340
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,930
To love and to happiness for ever.

341
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,975
For ever and ever.

342
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,772
- What's wrong?
- I want to talk now.

343
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:53,023
When you've drunk
to love and happiness.

344
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:54,274
- Now.
- After.

345
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:56,943
David, I promise we will.
Just keep him happy.

346
00:38:57,194 --> 00:39:02,490
It's not for me. It's for love
and happiness for ever.

347
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:10,288
Look over there. It's Cameron.

348
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:12,331
- Who?
- You remember Cameron.

349
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:14,041
- No.
- What's he doing here?

350
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,627
- That's not him.
- It is. Cameron!

351
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:21,005
Cameron, come on over here. Come on.

352
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,675
What?

353
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:28,303
Nothing. We thought
you were someone else.

354
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:30,847
Good luck!

355
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:35,059
- Why does he have to follow us around?
- What I was wanting to say was this.

356
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:36,310
Aha!

357
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,896
- The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
- Brian.

358
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,066
- Would you care to dance?
- Hold on. Who do you think you are?

359
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:45,151
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

360
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:49,655
- You interrupted us.
- I'm Brian McKinley. And who are you?

361
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:55,368
Well, Brian McKinley, if you wanna talk
to my girlfriend, you talk to me first.

362
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:58,496
If you wanna dance, you apply
three weeks in advance,...

363
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,206
..or you're gonna end up
inside a fucking bin bag!

364
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:06,085
You didn't apply, so you don't dance.

365
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:14,342
Do you think you could be
a little more forceful next time?

366
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:18,804
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. I think he got the message.

367
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:21,056
That was quite stressful.

368
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:25,644
Yeah, but you were good. He was
really good. Fuckin' bin bag, I like that.

369
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:29,730
You really explored
your maleness to the full there.

370
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:32,524
- You think so?
- You certainly had a good look around.

371
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:36,361
You were magnificent.

372
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:39,280
Yeah.

373
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:43,117
Fuckin' bin bag.

374
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:09,347
Fuckin' bin bag.

375
00:41:14,101 --> 00:41:17,854
Cameron! What a surprise!

376
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:11,109
Hello?

377
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,779
Hello?

378
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:24,078
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

379
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:28,916
- No one said anything.
- Or rendered speechless with desire.

380
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:32,877
I recall that feeling from
the days when I had such a thing.

381
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:37,131
- Are you all right?
- No.

382
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:42,844
Then let's spend some money.

383
00:42:43,845 --> 00:42:48,140
Hello. It's been a struggle,
but now our days of worry are over.

384
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,060
The light at the end of the tunnel
has expanded into a golden sunrise.

385
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:59,525
And now at last, at long last,
nothing will ever be the same again.

386
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:49,309
This is Alex Law reporting on
the video diary of his own life.

387
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,103
Let me tell you, I'm so happy I could die.

388
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,321
I think we ought to stop this, don't you?

389
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:07,657
- Oh, will you relax?
- You're making us all nervous.

390
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:11,035
- How much did you pay for this?
- I don't know.

391
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,496
- I can't remember.
- Tell me how much you paid.

392
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:16,457
- I can't remember.
- How much did you pay for this?

393
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:20,251
- No idea. I don't know.
- How much did you pay for this?!

394
00:44:20,502 --> 00:44:24,422
- 500.
- 500?

395
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:27,966
You paid 500 for this?

396
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:31,636
- That's what it cost.
- No. That's what you paid for it.

397
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:37,266
500 is what you paid for it.
We don't know how much it cost us yet.

398
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:42,687
For you two to have a good time.
We don't know the cost of that yet.

399
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:28,893
Excuse me. Did they take anything?

400
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,193
Is that enough for you?

401
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:40,861
Oi.

402
00:45:41,112 --> 00:45:43,280
- What?
- Is that enough for you?

403
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,116
- Yes, that's fine.
- There's plenty more.

404
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:49,952
That's fine.

405
00:45:55,165 --> 00:45:56,375
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

406
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,376
- You're not eating.
- Eating what?

407
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:05,215
- You're not eating like you used to.
- If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

408
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,688
Now swallow.

409
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,902
You should spend some money
instead of worrying about it.

410
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:32,530
- You'd feel much better.
- Once it's spent, you don't have to worry.

411
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,325
- It'll be a weight off your shoulders.
- You know we're right.

412
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:40,078
- I wanna secure it.
- Secure it? You wanna put it in a bank?

413
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:43,373
You don't wanna put it in a bank, do you?
Do you want to bury it?

414
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:47,751
- I don't see the point. It's stupid.
- Course it's stupid. We took the money.

415
00:46:48,002 --> 00:46:50,337
It was a material calculation.

416
00:46:50,587 --> 00:46:54,465
What's the point if it's underground
in some funny bank in some funny place?

417
00:46:54,716 --> 00:46:58,052
If you can't have it - spend it -
then what use is it? None.

418
00:46:58,302 --> 00:47:02,806
It's all for nothing. I didn't get into this
for nothing, so that I could have nothing.

419
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:07,476
Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.

420
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:18,236
Tastes different.

421
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:53,432
David, what are you doin' up there?

422
00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:03,190
Will you come down now?
It's not safe up there.

423
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:15,826
Are you listening to me?

424
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:20,955
Security and insanity
are not the same thing.

425
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:27,920
Shit.

426
00:49:05,994 --> 00:49:10,873
I don't care. A grown man shouldn't
be living in a loft. He isn't safe up there.

427
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:15,627
If you cared about him at all,
you'd use your influence to get him down.

428
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:18,254
- And the money?
- We could put it somewhere.

429
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:21,298
Where he can't get it?

430
00:49:21,548 --> 00:49:23,800
Well, you thought of that, not me.

431
00:49:24,051 --> 00:49:28,054
Forget it. He'll come down.

432
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:31,640
Oh, Juliet, look.

433
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:51,073
Hello, Mr Lumsden.
It's David Stevens here.

434
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:54,243
I'm sorry, sir. I won't be able
to make it to the office today.

435
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:59,497
It's my mother, sir. She's very ill
and I think I need to be with her just now.

436
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,918
I don't know. The doctors aren't sure.
It could go either way.

437
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:08,463
Yes, sir. I'll certainly stay in touch.

438
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:43,118
- Good day?
- What?

439
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:45,703
- Good day?
- What are you talking about?

440
00:50:45,953 --> 00:50:49,039
- I'm just asking if you had a good day.
- Why?

441
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:52,042
Well, I thought I'd make conversation.

442
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:56,504
- Please, I'd rather you didn't.

443
00:50:56,754 --> 00:51:00,090
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

444
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:06,721
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

445
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:13,778
It's in the loft! In the loft!

446
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:29,610
September 19, London Heathrow
to Rio de Janeiro.

447
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:33,864
It's British Airways.
You're looking at 765. That's 7-6-5.

448
00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:36,866
- That sounds fine.
- Air Portugal, on the other hand,...

449
00:55:37,117 --> 00:55:42,955
..it's via Lisbon, the same day.
It's 565. 5-6-5. Is catering important?

450
00:55:43,205 --> 00:55:45,916
- What?
- Air France, Glasgow direct.

451
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:49,752
But then you're looking at
the wrong end of 912. That's 9-1-2.

452
00:55:50,003 --> 00:55:53,214
- The first one was fine. Heathrow direct.
- It's up to you.

453
00:55:53,464 --> 00:55:58,426
Air Patagonia, that's a new outfit.
Via... via lots of different places, really.

454
00:55:58,677 --> 00:56:04,765
It's no catering. That's 411. 4-1-1.
It's good value, but refuelling at Bogot?..

455
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:07,559
The first one was fine.

456
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:12,355
It's up to you. 7-6-5.
How will you be paying?

457
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,377
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

458
00:56:46,634 --> 00:56:48,928
Oh, my God!

459
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:51,138
Christ!

460
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:56,267
No, no. Dear God. No! Christ!

461
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:37,010
No, and that's it.
I refuse to discuss it any further.

462
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,803
- It's the only way.
- I refuse.

463
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:42,807
- You're frightened.
- I'm not frightened. I'm a little terrified.

464
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:45,642
Did you see what happened
to the last two people?

465
00:57:45,892 --> 00:57:48,478
They went up alive and
they came back down dead.

466
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:52,690
Did you notice that? The difference,
I mean. Alive, dead - dead, alive.

467
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,276
It wasn't difficult to spot.

468
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:58,820
He killed them both.

469
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:03,407
- He cut them up.
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

470
00:58:03,658 --> 00:58:08,995
- And how's that?
- Because you're smarter than he is.

471
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:15,501
Yeah, well, that's what
I've always thought.

472
00:58:40,814 --> 00:58:44,901
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector
McCall. This is DC Mitchell.

473
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:47,194
I wonder if we could ask some questions.

474
00:58:47,445 --> 00:58:50,072
- What about?
- It's about the burglary.

475
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:53,533
- Burglary?
- Downstairs.

476
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:57,703
- Of course.
- Can we come in?

477
00:58:57,954 --> 00:59:00,789
So I just heard
her cries for help and all that.

478
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,917
When I went downstairs,
there were other people there.

479
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:08,045
So I just stood around, you know,
waiting, the way people do.

480
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:11,590
And when your colleagues arrived,
I came back upstairs.

481
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,428
That's about all, I think. I didn't actually
see anything useful, I don't think.

482
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,263
And the other three people,
did they hear anything?

483
00:59:19,513 --> 00:59:24,017
There are only two
other people in the flat.

484
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:34,860
- Two?
- Who said there were four?

485
00:59:35,193 --> 00:59:39,447
We understood there were four people
living here. Not always, but now four.

486
00:59:39,697 --> 00:59:42,533
No, three. Who said there were four?

487
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:47,162
How strange. And how unsatisfactory
to have misleading information.

488
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:49,706
Only three people here?

489
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:52,250
- You're sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

490
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,543
Who said there were four?

491
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:59,506
Make a note of that, Mitchell.
Only three rather than four. Write it down.

492
00:59:59,756 --> 01:00:02,508
You can use numbers or words.
I've no preference.

493
01:00:02,758 --> 01:00:05,719
- Which are you using?
- Both, sir.

494
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,889
Excellent.

495
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:12,016
DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr Stevens.

496
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:16,103
Under my tutelage, he will
undoubtedly make the grade.

497
01:00:16,353 --> 01:00:20,357
- I see.
- I doubt it.

498
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:23,359
- You'll wait in the hall?
- I'll wait.

499
01:00:23,609 --> 01:00:27,863
If it sounds like I'm getting killed,
call the police and tell them everything.

500
01:00:28,113 --> 01:00:30,824
Except maybe that it was
his idea in the first place.

501
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:33,326
That's important.
I need to die misunderstood.

502
01:00:33,576 --> 01:00:35,119
- Alex.
- What?

503
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:40,540
As smart as you are,
you might need a little help.

504
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:48,589
David, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open this lock and I'm gonna come up.

505
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:54,427
But what's really important
is that you remain calm. OK?

506
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:41,425
Alex?

507
01:01:41,676 --> 01:01:45,679
It's all right. It's just a pigeon.

508
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:04,028
Well, he isn't up here.

509
01:02:07,531 --> 01:02:11,534
Tell him to look for the money.

510
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,290
Look for the money.

511
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:23,294
Don't worry.
That's exactly what I'm doin'.

512
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:37,640
It's not up here. He has eaten it.

513
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,913
Are you looking for me?

514
01:03:05,163 --> 01:03:07,206
Looking for you, yeah.

515
01:03:07,457 --> 01:03:11,168
What for? What did you want?
The money? Was that it?

516
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:13,545
We just wanted to talk to you.

517
01:03:13,795 --> 01:03:19,383
Who else have you just wanted to talk to?
Maybe you thought they'd already got me.

518
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:23,637
- Who?
- Your friends.

519
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:27,891
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

520
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:32,436
He doesn't know, David.

521
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,357
Maybe you don't.

522
01:03:37,607 --> 01:03:40,151
I'm talking about the police.

523
01:07:09,328 --> 01:07:13,123
I thought you'd gone to work.

524
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:17,210
With a face like this?

525
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:37,269
Alex, the editor wants to see you.

526
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:50,405
- I'm sorry.
- So you should be.

527
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:57,578
Maybe we can still sort everything out.

528
01:08:01,873 --> 01:08:06,085
Well, we can certainly try.

529
01:08:08,462 --> 01:08:13,174
Three bodies. Decomposed.
Mutilated beyond recognition.

530
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:16,886
- I don't know anythin' about it.
- Of course you don't.

531
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:20,680
If you knew anything about it,
I wouldn't have to send you to cover it.

532
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,559
- Cover it?
- That's right. This is your break, son.

533
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,394
Cover it?

534
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:33,400
Jesus.

535
01:08:48,412 --> 01:08:51,999
Ow!

536
01:10:05,102 --> 01:10:11,024
All right. The releasable and printworthy
facts of the day so far are as follows.

537
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:15,569
Late yesterday, forestry workers
came across one set of human remains...

538
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,655
..in a grave which appeared
to have been recently dug.

539
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:24,077
Further excavation revealed another
deeper grave with two sets of remains.

540
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:30,207
- Is this a serial killer?
- How come they haven't been identified?

541
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:34,794
- Any obvious motive here?
- Is it true that one has been skinned?

542
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:37,296
Not entirely.

543
01:10:37,546 --> 01:10:41,008
All right, all right.
An area of skin "has" been removed.

544
01:10:41,258 --> 01:10:45,762
And you'd better keep this to yourselves.
There's no hands, no feet, no teeth.

545
01:10:46,012 --> 01:10:48,889
The face is totally
unrecognisable and, yes,...

546
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:53,560
..skin has been removed
from one of the bodies.

547
01:10:53,894 --> 01:10:56,062
As and when the corpses are removed,...

548
01:10:56,312 --> 01:11:00,608
..we will endeavour to ascertain the
mode of death and duration of burial,...

549
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:05,612
..as well as identification, which
will of course be passed on to you,...

550
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:10,366
..after informing,
where possible, the next of kin.

551
01:11:57,197 --> 01:12:00,283
- Are you OK?
- Yes, of course.

552
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:04,537
Why wouldn't I be?

553
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:11,251
- I don't know. I just thought maybe...
- We were just sorting things out.

554
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:14,879
- You'd better read all about it.
- We already know.

555
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:16,714
It was on the television.

556
01:12:16,964 --> 01:12:19,591
Of course, but print
provides a more lucid and...

557
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:21,885
Oh, shut up, Alex.

558
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:26,222
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't
deep enough and you wouldn't listen.

559
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:28,474
It doesn't necessarily matter.

560
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:32,978
They don't know who they are and have
nothing to connect us with them. Nothing.

561
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:35,521
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex.

562
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:38,024
It makes us feel a whole lot better.

563
01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:44,195
- I beg your pardon?
- It makes us feel a whole lot better.

564
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:48,366
That's what I thought he said.

565
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:14,346
Shh. Stop.

566
01:13:14,596 --> 01:13:16,806
What are you doin' here?

567
01:13:17,057 --> 01:13:19,017
It's about me and David.

568
01:13:19,267 --> 01:13:23,520
- The perfect couple, I should say.
- You mustn't take it so badly.

569
01:13:23,771 --> 01:13:28,316
Don't worry. I'd do exactly the same
thing, only I don't think I'm his type.

570
01:13:28,566 --> 01:13:33,195
- Don't you ever stop?
- No.

571
01:13:57,883 --> 01:14:01,219
Take all the time you like, Doctor.

572
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:04,639
No, I've never seen any of them.

573
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:08,475
Look again, if you like.

574
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:16,232
I'm sorry, I haven't seen them.

575
01:14:16,482 --> 01:14:20,027
- Do you have a good memory for faces?
- The same as everyone else.

576
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:24,989
But in your work you must meet lots of
people every day. New people, new faces.

577
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:26,699
Yes.

578
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:29,493
What do you recognise most,
names or faces?

579
01:14:29,743 --> 01:14:32,787
Diseases.

580
01:14:33,038 --> 01:14:37,208
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

581
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:42,212
- I suppose so.
- I meant, that's what it's like.

582
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:44,839
- Sorry?
- You said you supposed so.

583
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:48,634
- I wasn't offering it for debate.
- He wasn't offering it for debate.

584
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:53,847
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

585
01:15:18,535 --> 01:15:22,163
No, I've never seen
any of these men before.

586
01:15:22,413 --> 01:15:26,083
Take a look at the first two.

587
01:15:28,335 --> 01:15:30,253
No, I don't know them.

588
01:15:30,503 --> 01:15:37,759
If I told you their car was parked outside
just now, would that surprise you?

589
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:45,099
Yes, I suppose so.

590
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,394
Well, is it?

591
01:15:49,644 --> 01:15:52,814
- What?
- Parked there?

592
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:55,566
No. Not any more.

593
01:15:55,816 --> 01:16:00,403
I just wondered if it would surprise you.

594
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,448
- That's it.
- That's all?

595
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:05,533
Yes.

596
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:11,371
- Sorry to waste your time.
- Oh, not at all. Don't worry.

597
01:16:12,163 --> 01:16:14,457
- One thing.
- Your watch.

598
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:17,418
- Your watch.
- Is it real?

599
01:16:17,668 --> 01:16:22,297
Oh, no. It's a fake. I got it in Thailand.
The second hand doesn't sweep.

600
01:16:22,547 --> 01:16:26,134
- I see.
- Right.

601
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:30,345
Tell you what. If you do
remember these guys,...

602
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:34,474
..maybe you could give me
a phone on this number.

603
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:38,853
Any time you like.

604
01:16:43,982 --> 01:16:48,402
I didn't tell them anything, nothing
at all, absolutely nothing. They're plods.

605
01:16:48,653 --> 01:16:53,740
If they had any witnesses, any forensic
evidence, they would have whipped it out.

606
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,368
- They know.
- They can know all they like.

607
01:16:57,619 --> 01:16:59,787
- They know.
- So? They know.

608
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:03,665
So what? There's nothing
to connect us with that body stuff.

609
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:08,878
- Except the money.
- He's right, Alex. They know.

610
01:19:50,056 --> 01:19:53,309
Come on.

611
01:19:53,559 --> 01:19:55,269
My office is closed.

612
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:58,272
Life, however, grinds on
towards its conclusion.

613
01:19:58,522 --> 01:20:03,568
In the meantime, you may wish to leave a
message, but the final decision is yours.

614
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:13,660
David? You forgot to wake me.

615
01:20:24,752 --> 01:20:29,173
- So let's go.
- You and me?

616
01:20:29,715 --> 01:20:33,718
Together.

617
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:39,849
Hey! Alex! Who are you calling
at this time of night?

618
01:20:44,603 --> 01:20:48,189
Come out here and talk to us.

619
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:07,163
Well? Sex lines, is that it?

620
01:21:07,414 --> 01:21:10,875
Triple-X-rated, interactive fantasies?
Old habits die hard.

621
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:14,962
- I was phoning your mother.
- You old devil.

622
01:21:15,212 --> 01:21:18,715
Well, anyway.
As you can see, we're leaving.

623
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:21,926
- So I gathered.
- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

624
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:25,762
- Don't worry. I'll forward your mail.
- No, really.

625
01:21:26,013 --> 01:21:30,600
I am sorry. Sorry to be ducking out on
you. I hope you won't take it personally.

626
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:34,228
No, no. Don't let it worry you.
It's probably for the best.

627
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:40,108
All for the best. Exactly. I wouldn't
want things to end on a downer.

628
01:21:40,358 --> 01:21:43,277
- Not at all.
- I mean, we've ups and downs, right.

629
01:21:43,527 --> 01:21:46,613
Good times, bad times.

630
01:21:46,864 --> 01:21:49,366
We could talk all night,
but we have to go. Don't we?

631
01:21:49,616 --> 01:21:51,868
Yes.

632
01:21:52,118 --> 01:21:56,330
- And you need your sleep.
- Yes.

633
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,169
No, I can't think of
anything else that matters.

634
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:06,297
- About your mail.
- Very good of you to offer, but...

635
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:08,590
Where do you think you'll go?

636
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,343
Where will we go?

637
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,595
Where will we go?

638
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,805
Juliet?

639
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:18,724
- I don't know.
- Don't be so coy, dear.

640
01:22:18,974 --> 01:22:21,184
You're going to Rio.

641
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:24,187
- What?
- That's right.

642
01:22:24,437 --> 01:22:26,898
Rio de Janeiro, on your own.

643
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:32,694
You should know.
You bought the fucking ticket!

644
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:39,366
Did you see that?

645
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:43,245
I bet she didn't show you that before
she sent you up there. What did she say?

646
01:22:43,495 --> 01:22:48,416
We'll split it together,
you and me, fifty-fifty.

647
01:22:50,126 --> 01:22:52,294
But I bet you didn't say you'd split on him.

648
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:55,755
- It wasn't like that.
- Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.

649
01:22:56,006 --> 01:22:59,592
I bought it.

650
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:02,553
What?

651
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:05,722
I bought the tickets.
For her and for me. It was my idea.

652
01:23:05,972 --> 01:23:08,308
Your idea. I see.

653
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:10,393
Well, that fits.

654
01:23:10,643 --> 01:23:15,355
I mean, you and him fit together.
I should have seen that a long time ago.

655
01:23:15,606 --> 01:23:18,691
- Alex, stop him!
- No, let him go. Let him have it all.

656
01:23:18,942 --> 01:23:22,945
Juliet, let him go.

657
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:28,366
I'm leaving.

658
01:23:34,538 --> 01:23:41,044
You shouldn't have hit her! Do what
you like, but you shouldn't have hit her!

659
01:23:56,348 --> 01:23:59,559
You want it?

660
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:01,102
You want it?

661
01:24:01,353 --> 01:24:04,355
Aagh!

662
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:08,734
You bastard!

663
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,247
You did the right thing.

664
01:26:02,247 --> 01:26:06,167
But I can't take you with me.

665
01:27:18,103 --> 01:27:20,438
Be OK, Mummy.

666
01:27:20,688 --> 01:27:24,400
Oh, I'll be all right.

667
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:47,419
Hello, Inspector.

668
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:15,777
# It's the sound that lovers

669
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:20,280
# Hear when they discover

670
01:28:20,531 --> 01:28:29,246
# There could be no other for their love

671
01:28:29,497 --> 01:28:35,710
# It's my happy heart you hear

672
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,797
# Singing loud and singing clear

673
01:28:40,047 --> 01:28:44,259
# And it's all because you're near

674
01:28:44,509 --> 01:28:48,262
# Me, my love

675
01:28:48,513 --> 01:28:52,808
# Take my happy heart away

676
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:56,978
# Let me love you night and day

677
01:28:57,228 --> 01:29:01,357
# In your arms I wanna stay

678
01:29:01,607 --> 01:29:08,238
# Oh, my love #

679
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:13,117
Oh, yes. I believe in friends.

680
01:29:13,367 --> 01:29:15,577
I believe we need them.

681
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:19,998
But, if one day you find that
you just can't trust them any more,...

682
01:29:20,248 --> 01:29:22,500
..well what then?

683
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:26,336
What then?
