1
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:40,140
^ ^

2
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,620
嘿 如果你一大早要起床趕車...
Hey, hey. If you're coming in for the morning grind...

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,460
那麼這絕對又是一個交通繁忙 惱人的週一
it's another brutal Monday out there traffic-wise.

4
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,710
二號道以及五號道交通繁忙
The 2 is slow-and-go to the 5.

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,380
十號道因擁堵接近癱瘓
A Sig Alert is bogging down the I-10.

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,720
如果你還在四零五高速路上
And if you're on the 405 freeway,

7
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,460
你上班可能就要遲到了
you're probably already late for work.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,760
如果你的老闆要給你點顏色看看
If your boss gives you a hard time about it,

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,380
你讓他到這裡來和...
have him come down here and talk to...

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,580
- ...Rachel談談 - 噢 不
- ...Rachel. - Oh, no.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,460
好 哈哈 謝謝 還是免了吧
Zing! Ha, ha. Thanks, Skip.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,140
但是 說到老闆 廣告之後...
But, hey, speaking of bosses, after the break...

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,970
我們請來了三位自已創業的小伙子
we get to meet three guys

14
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,020
白手起家 追尋他們的夢想
who are chasing their dream of becoming their own bosses.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,220
馬上回來
Stay with us.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,700
暫停 很好 各位 九十秒後繼續
And we're out. Very good, guys. We're back in 90 seconds.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,200
老闆不是人2

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,580
天啊 黛爾 你別再冒汗了
Jesus Christ. Dale, you gotta stop sweating, pal.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,850
噢 哇 你都濕了
Oh, wow, you are wet. "Stop sweating."

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,820
"別出汗了" 怎麼讓它停下來了
How do I stop sweating?

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,540
這可是件大事 我們把全部都押在這上面了
This is a big deal. We got everything riding on this.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,770
我們辭掉工作
We've quit our jobs,

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,380
我還有三個孩子嗷嗷待哺 怎麼說?
I have three children to think about now. How about that?

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,560
想像一下 你等下表現得亮瞎全場
Think about this. You do a good job right now,

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,260
你的兒子們絕對會以你為豪的
you're gonna make your boys very proud.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,340
女兒 我有三個女兒 老兄
Girls. I have three girls, dude.

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,580
好吧 她們那年齡也認不出男的女的
Right. You can't even tell at that age.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,050
她們都活像長手腳的馬鈴薯
They basically look like potatoes with arms.

29
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,140
別把我孩子叫作馬鈴薯
Don't call my kids potatoes.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,100
- 尊重一下孩子們 - 別把他惹惱了
- Respect the kids. - Don't piss him off.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,150
她們可穿得粉紅粉紅的!
They wear pink!

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,700
讓他冷靜下來
Calm him down.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,460
很多人都喜歡穿粉色衣服
A lot of guys wear pink.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,230
我就很喜歡我那件粉色的馬球衫
I have a pink polo shirt that I love.

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,820
快別說了
Come on.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,550
能拿一卷紙巾過來嗎?
Can we get a roll of paper towels?

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,820
快來人拿捲紙巾!
Can I get paper towels?!

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,460
你為什麼要大吼大叫?
Why are you barking at people?

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,300
他可是禮貌地說 你卻在大吼
He's saying please, you're just barking.

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,180
- 沒禮沒貌 - 兄弟 你該把臉擦乾
- Bad manners. - Buddy, dry your face.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,140
- 他緊張得要死 - 難以置信
- He's freaking out. - It's unbelievable.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,810
你們沒我也行吧?
Can you go on without me?

43
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,540
不然你待在車裡等著?
Why don't you wait in the car?

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,060
別鬧 很簡單的 只要你放輕鬆
Stop, this is gonna be easy. You have to calm down.

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,610
聽著 尼克會用事實和數據說話
Look, Nick's gonna hit them with facts and figures,

46
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,060
他很有頭腦的 好不?
because he's the brains, right?

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,500
你就說說 你和你老婆怎麼天雷勾動地火
You talk about how you and your wife fucked

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,860
養大那三個馬鈴薯大的孩子
and made three potatoes with arms.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,060
你去感化人心 我就做我該做的事 隨機應變
You're the heart. Me, I'll do my thing, get in where I fit in.

50
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,300
- 你是靈魂? - 不 勞資是你們的大屌
- You're the soul? - No, I'm the dick and balls.

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,380
- 明白了 - 我為什麼要當靈魂?
- Got it. - Why would I wanna be the soul?

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,660
就是別嚇昏過去 大力吸氣
Just don't pass out. Just keep breathing.

53
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,980
看吧 很簡單的
See? This will be easy.

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,440
我們要做的就是展現自我
All we have to do is be ourselves.

55
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,410
還是別展現自我了
Let's not be ourselves.

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,700
我們的自我都丟垃圾堆去了
Ourselves is a Dumpster fire.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,240
要比自我做的更好才行 升華自我
Let's be better than ourselves. Let's try to elevate a little.

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,140
說得很好 沒人做的了自我
That's a good note. Nobody be themselves.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,220
注意 還有二十秒節目開始
All right, we're back in 20 seconds.

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,180
嘿 小伙子們 感謝你們的到來
Hey, fellas, thanks for coming.

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,420
- 很高興見到你們 - 早安 你好嗎?
- Nice to meet you. - Good morning. How are you?

62
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,780
嘿 伙伴 一團糟對不
Hey, my man. There's trouble.

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,660
- 太過火了 - 他都不介意
- Too much. - Well, he went with it.

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,040
黛爾·阿爾比
Dale Arbus.

65
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,140
很高興認識你 伙伴
Pleasure to meet you, man.

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,060
感謝你們的到來 這肯定很有趣
Thanks for coming on. This will be fun.

67
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,600
是的
Yeah.

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,350
拉鏈一直都拉得這麼低嗎?
Does that zip all the way down?

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,940
離節目開始還有五 四...
And we're back in five, four...

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,940
"洛杉磯 早安"

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,630
歡迎回來 知道嗎
And we're back. You know,

72
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,820
我們每週都會在 "創意焦點" 中...
every week we like to highlight...

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,980
採訪本土的發明家或是企業家
local inventors and entrepreneurs in our Big Idea Spotlight.

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,180
說得對 麥克
That's right, Mike.

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,300
今天我們有幸請到三位現代安迪生...
And today we have three modern-day...

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,260
他們發明了一種新型洗浴器 並且希望它大賣
Edisons who've created a new shower gadget they hope to really clean up with.

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,700
有請尼克·庫爾特還有黛爾
Please, welcome Nick, Kurt and Dale.

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,900
很高興來到現場
Pleasure to be here.

79
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,480
在我們介紹你們的產品之前
Before we get to the product,

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,460
能告訴我們...
can you tell us...

81
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,730
是什麼激發了
what is it that

82
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,660
你們三個人自己去創業的想法呢?
inspired three regular Joes to go into business for yourselves?

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,900
我們三個都曾為討人厭的上司倍受屈辱地工作
We were all working at pretty terrible jobs for some awful bosses.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,200
然後就想 如果我們自己當老闆
And thought if we got a chance to be our own bosses,

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,820
我們肯定不會像他們一樣
we'd do things differently.

86
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,220
這就是我們的機遇
This might be our shot.

87
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,750
我們從未想過有這機會
We didn't think we'd get the chance,

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,460
但是黛爾有個很棒的想法
but Dale had an amazing idea.

89
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,700
別讓黛爾搭話
Don't go to Dale.

90
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,740
後來 我們就開始聚在一起 討論發明...
And, we started meeting together to talk about the invention...

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,860
不再抱怨鬧心的工作
instead of complaining about our jobs.

92
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,340
嘿 我覺得這真是讓人 "性" 奮
Hey, I think that's exciting.

93
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,060
黛爾 我想問
Dale, you know, I just wanna know,

94
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,700
是什麼激發你的靈感...
where did the idea come from...

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,980
...去設計一個新型蓮蓬頭?
...for a new showerhead?

96
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,580
我有三個孩子
I have three kids.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,340
我是來談心的
So that's the heart.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,060
- 真是幸福 - 是的 他有三胞胎
- That's a blessing. - Yeah, well, he has triplets.

99
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,340
說實話 有點多了 鴨梨山大
In all honesty, it's too many. I'm pretty overwhelmed.

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,700
很顯然 他心思全在那上面了
Well, he's got them on his mind, clearly.

101
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,220
我來回答吧
Let me answer the question.

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,620
黛爾當時從一個自助洗車服務回來...
Dale, had just gotten back from one of those self-service car washes...

103
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,400
... 那裡有杆 有肥皂
...with the wand with the soap.

104
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,860
總之是所有東西的結合體
It's got everything in one thing.

105
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,470
他就想 "為什麼不給我們
He thought, "Why don't they make one of

106
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,860
設計一個類似的東西呢"
these for your body?"

107
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,490
在我們幾杯酒下肚之後 靈光一閃
After we had a few beers, we came up with the,

108
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,740
就想出 "洗浴好基友" 了
Shower Buddy.

109
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,960
"洗浴好基友"?
The Shower Buddy?

110
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,700
不好意思 那名字還只是暫定而已
I'm sorry, that name's not official yet.

111
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,210
不 他說錯了 是正式的
No, he's wrong. It is official.

112
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,740
我想取名為 "洗浴好爹地"
I wanted the "Shower Daddy."

113
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,080
"洗浴好爹地" 這名字真是爛出新高度
"Shower Daddy" is worse on every level.

114
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,260
我同意尼克說的
I have to agree with Nick.

115
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,540
好過有個怪咖和你一起洗澡
Better than having some strange dude with you.

116
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,010
才不是怪咖呢 老兄
It's not some strange dude, Dale,

117
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,940
我說過多少次了 是你的好基友
as I've said many times. It's your buddy.

118
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,820
為什麼讓你的好基友和你一起洗澡?
Why would your buddy be in the shower?

119
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,860
為什麼要和你爸爸?
Why would your dad?

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,420
別在節目上大吼大叫
Don't scream on television.

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,220
不如這樣
You know what?

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,740
小伙子們 向我們展示展示你們的小發明吧
How about you fellas show us how this gizmo works?

123
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,660
好吧? 咱們走吧
Right? Let's get it going.

124
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,830
好 看看吧 拿出來秀秀
Yes. Make it rain. Yes. Work it, work it.

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,940
噢 真是帥呆了
Oh, this is awesome.

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
庫爾特會進去 打開水龍頭
So Kurt's gonna go ahead and get in there. He's gonna turn on the shower.

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,340
你們就會看到水流出來
You're gonna see the water come out.

128
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,780
過一會 洗髮液就會自動從蓮蓬頭噴出來
After a bit, the shampoo's gonna automatically be triggered out of the showerhead...

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,620
- 沒有水壓 - 那個藍色把手
- No water pressure. - The blue handle.

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,980
- 沒有水壓 - 後面有一個抽水機
- No water pressure. - There's a pump on the back.

131
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,310
我可以手動抽水
I could pump it manually.

132
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,420
黛爾去幫幫忙 謝謝你 老兄
Dale's gonna help out. Thank you, buddy.

133
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,140
- 抽水機 - 你搞得定嗎?
- Pump. - You got it?

134
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,300
- 可以的 - 好
- I got it. - Yeah?

135
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,220
水流出來後 洗髮液就會順著水流出來...
Water comes out, the shampoo mixes with the water...

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,260
緊接著 就會流出護髮液
then shortly after that, conditioner.

137
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,700
所以用 "洗浴好基友"
You shower in half the time

138
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,820
只花你平時一半的時間
with the Shower Buddy.

139
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,890
大多數美國人... 不知道你聽說過沒...
The average American... I don't know if you know this....

140
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,180
平均每週工作五十多小時

141
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,540
- 手酸死了 - 來 我幫你
- Hand's cramping up. - Here, let me help.

142
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,300
... 如果我們能替你們剩下五分鐘...
...commuting. If we can save you just five minutes...

143
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,100
- 杆子是太乾燥了嗎? - 對 吐點口水潤滑
- The whole rod's too dry, right? - Yeah, spit on it.

144
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,140
- 好點沒? - 看吧 加了潤滑劑好點吧
- Better? - See, yeah. If you lube it up, it's better.

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,660
沒錯 確實是
Oh, no, absolutely.

146
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,060
抱歉 這機器背後有個洞 我得用手指戳一下
I'm sorry. There's a hole in the back. I'm gonna stick my finger in it.

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,180
我們不想知道你怎麼搞定的
We don't really care how you get it done.

148
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,740
趕快弄好它 儘快結束
Just get it done. Get it finished.

149
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,780
- 無論如何搞定它 - 直播嘛 對吧?
- Whatever it takes. - Live TV, right?

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,660
現場直播 你能怎麼辦?
Live TV. What are you gonna do?

151
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,500
- 好了 有水了 - 終於射出來了
- Yeah. Here we go. - Oh, here it comes.

152
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,220
嘿
Hey!

153
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,460
- 我早就說過 - 就像預先想的一樣好使 對吧
- I told you. - Works just as promised, okay?

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,660
- 好了 現在可以關了 - 太炫酷了 我想要一個
- Now, go ahead and shut it off. - It's so cool. I want one.

155
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,380
你不能帶走這一個 這是原型機
You can't have this one. It's the prototype.

156
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,780
但我們在找投資商
But we're looking for partners.

157
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,180
我說句話吧 我想加入 我來投資
I'll tell you right now. I'm sold. I wanna invest.

158
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,100
終於找到一個了 麥克
We got one. All right, Mike.

159
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,340
怎麼和你們聯繫呢?
Now, how would I get in touch with you guys?

160
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,780
- 你可以上我們的網站- 抱歉 沒聽清
- You go straight to Nickkurtdale. - I'm sorry, what?

161
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,820
我們的網站 尼克kurtdale.com
It's our website. Nickkurtdale. com.

162
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,900
我確定我還是沒把名字聽清楚
I'm positive I'm not hearing that right.

163
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,100
是我們的名字 尼克·庫爾特·黛爾
It's our names: Nick, Kurt, Dale.

164
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,660
尼克庫爾特黛爾
Nickkurtdale.

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,580
快換掉那名字吧
Y'all gotta change that name.

166
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,540
不敢相信我們之前沒有像這樣宣傳
Cannot believe we never said it out loud before.

167
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,700
紙上寫的挺好的啊
It looked so good on paper.

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,340
可惜只是黃粱美夢
It was a nice dream while it lasted,

169
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,100
還是想想怎麼求回我們以前的工作吧
but I think it's time we all go beg for our jobs back.

170
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,540
也許改接受現實了 我們根本不是造機器的料
Maybe just accept the fact that we'll always be cogs in the machine.

171
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,100
等等 "造機器的屌" 那是什麼?
Wait. Cocks in the machine. What is that?

172
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,620
是 "料" 開頭的
"Cogs." Guh.

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,500
知道嗎? 你說得對 我們不是當老闆的料
You know what? You're right. We're not boss material.

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,220
我們像工蜂一樣 像豬一樣賣力幹
We're worker bees. We're grunts.

175
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,240
噢 老兄 那首歌 我現在聽不得
Oh, boy. That song. I can't hear that now.

176
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,900
調成振動吧
Just put it on vibrate.

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,100
你能消停點嗎?
Will you stop? Please?

178
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,910
我專門調這歌激勵我們的
I picked this song to inspire us.

179
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,020
至少不是激勵我
It's not inspiring me.

180
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,740
快看 未知來電
Look at this. Unknown caller.

181

Really? Yes. No, of course. I know exactly who you are.

When you're in a good mood, it's a good song.

200
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,540
心情不好 就覺得很爛
Bad mood, bad song.

201
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,150
這就是藝術 真是良曲
That's art. That's good art.

拿點水抹掉
Put water on it.

215
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,020
不要水擦 那樣會讓汙漬凝固的
I don't need water. That will set it.

216
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,750
別拿著餅乾離我這麼近
Get the cookie away from me.

230
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,740

261
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,990
天啊
Jesus fucking Christ.

262
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,660
親愛的 我們費勁腦汁
Sweetheart, we were racking our brains.

263
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,740
啤酒罐到底是用什麼做的?
What's a beer can made out of?

264
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,350
你是說鋁嗎?
Do you mean aluminum?

265
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,820
- 是這樣的 朗小姐 謝謝你 - 好的
- That'll be all, Miss Lang. Thank you. - Okay.

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,300
她要去哪裡?
And where does she go now?

267
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,060
這就是你們所嚮往的酷東西
Now, that is the kind of cool shit you have to look forward to.

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,300
這就是交易最棒的地方 你都不用親自操心
Best part about this deal: you're not gonna have to lift a finger.

269
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,180
本公司會承擔產品未來的發展...
My company will assume all future product development...

270
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,060
外包到天朝生產...
outsource manufacturing to China...

271
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,780
你們會一次性收到一筆 "英俊的" 報酬
and you receive a handsome one-time development fee.

272
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
我想深入談談這費用的問題...
I wanna dig in on the one-time fee because...

273
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,220
看到這個橄欖球了嗎?
You see this football?

274
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,630
是培頓·曼寧拋出後
This is the one Peyton Manning threw

275
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,340
那人用頭盔接住的那個 拿去吧
and the guy caught it in his helmet. Keep it.

276
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,150
知道嗎? 雷克斯 關於報酬的問題
You know, Rex, the one-time fee thing,

277
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,260
我們不太想放棄我們公司的所有權
we're not looking to give up control of the company.

278
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,630
是的 我們想負責生產的部分
Right. We wanna handle all the manufacturing

279
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,940
而貴公司負責行銷
and you guys do distribution.

280
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,700
什麼 你們負責生產? 在美國本土?
What, you manufacture? Here, in America?

281
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,100
- 計劃之中的 - 就像美國夢之類的
- That's the plan. - The American-dream thing.

282
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,590
小子 我不想打擊你
Boys, I hate to break it to you,

283
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,820
但俗話說 "美國創造 中國製造"
but the American dream, it's made in China.

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,420
聽著 很傻很天真 但我尊重你們...
Now, look, I respect your naivete...

285
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,860
但恐怕這筆交易只能這麼處理
but I'm afraid that this deal only happens one way.

286
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,020
我剛剛說了"英俊的"報酬 不是嗎?
I did say "handsome fee", right?

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,980
能給我一點時間嗎? 我想和我的合伙人談談
Can I have one minute? Just love to talk to my partners.

288
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,860
好吧 慢慢來 我去那邊等著
You got it. Take your time. I'll be over here.

289
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,340
- 噢 伙伴 - 老兄
- Oh, boy. - Man.

290
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,900
- 你們覺得怎麼樣? - 我不知道說什麼好...
- What do you think? - I didn't wanna say anything...

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,300
他指的可能是伊萊·曼寧 並非培頓·曼寧
but he means Eli Manning, not Peyton Manning.

292
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,370
可能是吧 庫爾特你呢?
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Kurt.

293
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,340
我覺得那女的身材真他媽正點
I think she has an amazing fucking body...

294
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,990
她的口音又讓她性感了許多
but that accent puts her over the top.

295
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,540
簡直不可思議 還有那條裙子
It's insane. That dress.

296
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,780
我同意你們倆說的 但是對那筆交易怎麼說?
Agreed on both points. How about the deal?

297
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,020
- 那筆交易 拿下它吧 - 我們該接受
- The deal. Gotta take it. - We should take it.

298
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,580
- 拿錢走人 - 他有這麼多酷東西
- Take the money and get out. - He's got cool shit.

299
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,320
想像一下 你也擁有這些
Imagine having your own cool shit.

300
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,500
但是仔細看看這裡
But look at this place.

301
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,220
這人靠他的公司賺了很多錢...
I mean, these guys make loads of money selling stuff...

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,740
但他覺得我們的產品還不錯
and he just called our Shower Buddy a home run.

303
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,590
為何要把一支潛力股就這樣賣出去呢?
Why sell a home run for a one-time fee?

304
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,420
很有道理
That's a good point.

305
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,260
我也不知道
I don't know.

306
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,380
我拿這錢養活史黛西 還有我的女兒們
I could use the money for Stacy and the girls.

307
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,980
這也有道理 真的 我也需要錢
That's a good point. That's true. I could use money.

308
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,660
我懂的 但這不僅僅只是錢的問題
I get that. But maybe it's not just about the money.

309
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,980
有道理
That's a good point.

310
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,100
可能還關係到 不再為任何人工作
Maybe it's about never having to work for anybody ever again.

311
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,500
- 說得對 - 對吧? 自己當老闆
- That's right. - Right? Being our own bosses.

312
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,420
- 要我說還是得指望我們自己 - 我也是
- I say we bet on ourselves. - Me too.

313
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,660
- 你說得對 - 我同意
- You're right. - I'm in.

314
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,980
我也同意 就這麼幹
I'm in. Let's do it.

315
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,420
好吧 雷克斯
Okay. Rex. Ahem.

316
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,380
- 我們拒絕你的提議 - 抱歉
- No deal. - Sorry.

317
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,740
- 我們還是打算自己幹 - 是嗎?
- We're, betting on ourselves. - Is that right?

318
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,890
對 不要難受
Yeah. And no hard feelings.

319
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,140
我們還是很感激你那慷慨的提議的
Honestly, we really appreciate the offer.

320
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,580
- 抱歉 - 我尊重你們的決定
- Sorry. - Yeah. I can respect that.

321
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,620
要拒絕三百萬大洋 確實需要莫大的勇氣
Takes some serious balls to walk away from 3 million bucks.

322
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,060
等等 三百萬美元? 我們接受了
Hang on. Three million dollars? We'll take that.

323
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,700
抱歉 提議收回了
Sorry. Offer's off the table.

324
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,100
那就一半 一半總可以了吧 一半可以嗎?
We'll take half. Half is fine. Can we have half?

325
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,420
過這村沒這店 總之感謝你們的到來
Ship's sailed. Thank you so much for coming in.

326
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,310
黛爾把那球還給我吧
Dale, I'm gonna need that ball back.

327
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,660
祝君在美國創業順利
Good luck building something in America.

328
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,660
你們要知道...
You know...

329
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,580
我當初在美國可是白手起家的
I built this company from the bottom up here in America.

330
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,600
父親 沒注意你回來了
Dad, I didn't know you were back.

331
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,820
我說了你能用我的辦公室嗎?
What'd I tell you about using my office?

332
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,300
- 我知道 我就想... 你懂的... - 我是伯特·漢森
- I know, I just thought, you know... - Bert Hanson.

333
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,820
你們幾個就是"浴室好基友"的合伙人嗎
You're the Shower Buddy guys?

334
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,540
- 是的 先生 - 對 我們就是 先生
- Yes, sir. - Yeah. We are, sir.

335
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,390
我對你們想要大幹一場並希望有所作為
I respect you gentlemen for wanting

336
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,500
而最終確立了自己地位的精神
to roll up your sleeves and build something...

337
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,700
表示尊敬...
stake your claim.

338
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,500
其實 我來到這個國家的時候一無所有
Now, I came to this country with nothing.

339
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,430
通過冒險以及艱辛工作
And through risk and hard work,

340
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,620
我的美國夢才得以實現
I made my own American dream come true.

341
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,540
- 你很厲害啊 - 嗯 繼續聽著
- Good for you. - Well, here's what I'm gonna do.

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,980
我會把我與太平洋沿岸國家的關係介紹給你們
I'll refer you to my contact at Pacific Shore National.

343
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,140
- 那是個銀行 - 他們不會不給你們貸款...
- That's a bank. - They won't balk at giving you a loan...

344
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
一旦他們聽到伯特·漢森
once they hear that Bert Hanson

345
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,740
剛開始就一下訂了 呃...
just has placed an initial order of, say...

346
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,820
十萬套
100,000 units?

347
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,300
- 十萬套的"浴室好基友"嗎 - 哇哦 哈
- A hundred-thousand Shower Buddies? - Whoa. Ha!

348
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,380
你要十萬套"浴室好基友"嗎
You're gonna make 100,000 Shower Buddies?

349
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,540
老爸 你在說什麼 我們可從來不做這種買賣
Dad, what are you talking about? We never make this kind of deal.

350
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,860
很抱歉 先生
I'm sorry, sir.

351
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,540
但是比爾德·斯特姆得做你們的獨家零售商
But Boulder Stream needs to be your exclusive retailer.

352
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,250
讓我仔細想想 可以
Let's think it over. Of course.

353
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,820
我們一定不會答應另外其他人的請求的
We won't pick up the phone if anyone calls.

354
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,540
- 就這麼定了嗎 - 必須的 就這麼定了
- We have a deal? - Yeah, you got a fucking deal.

355
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,350
哎 真是太好了 真棒
Hey, all right. There it is.

356
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,940
我抓到他的手腕了 哈
I got his elbow. Yeah.

357
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,980
- 我從你那裡拿了點巧克力呢 - 沒關係
- I got some chocolate on you there. - It doesn't matter.

358
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,990
太棒了 這真是個好消息
That's great. That is good news.

359
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,500
這裡有兩萬平方英尺大 但租賃期至少為五年
So it's 20,000 square feet, but it's a minimum five-year lease.

360
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,430
兩萬平方英尺
Twenty thousand.

361
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,340
聽起來比我們所需要的面積要大得多
That sounds like a lot more than we need.

362
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,660
但我們也需要放些東西進來 不是嗎
But we want something we can grow into, right?

363
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,650
我們的確有筆大單 尼克
And we have a really big order, Nick.

364
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,140
說得對 來吧 尼克
Damn straight. Come on, Nick.

365
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,140
- 尼克 叫你呢 - 我什麼也不知道
- Nick. Nick. - I don't know.

366
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,740
- 你明白我的意思 我是說就它吧 就是它了 - 對
- You know, I say we take it. I say we take it. - Yes.

367
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,740
- 對 就它了 - 太棒了
- Yes, we do. - Excellent.

368
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,700
你沒有一點工作經驗
You've got no work experience at all.

369
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,020
這很糟糕嗎
Is that bad?

370
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,540
開玩笑的吧 這樣很好
Are you kidding? It's great.

371
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,380
- 你熱情飛揚而又精力十足 - 並且不夠資格
- You're enthusiastic and you're unjaded. - And unqualified.

372
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,700
- 告訴你 你被僱傭了 - 哎喲
- You know what? You're hired. - Oops.

373
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,740
- 真的嗎 - 這真讓人出乎意料 並且 毫不值得
- Really? - That was unexpected and, undeserving.

374
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,940
你被僱傭了
You're hired.

375
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,100
通過 很明顯你通過了
That's a yes. That's an obvious yes.

376
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,820
- 呃 又一個... - 沒有一點工作經驗
- Well, again... - No résumé at all.

377
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,540
不需要那個 你的眼睛已經告訴我們一切了 你很誠實
Don't need it. Your eyes speak. You seem honest.

378
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,740
等下 伙伴
Hold on, pal.

379
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,860
- 你被僱傭了 - 真的嗎
- You're hired. - Really?

380
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,140
- 如果你選擇加入我們的話 - 謝謝
- I mean, if you'll have us. - Thank you.

381
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,620
- 越來越快了 - 呃...
- Becoming faster now. - Well...

382
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,700
- 你能從週六晚開始上班嗎 - 當然可以
- Can you start on Saturday evening? - Absolutely.

383
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,500
那太棒了 我到時候找你
Okay, great, I'll get ahold of you.

384
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,530
上面說的你曾經犯過重罪
Says here you've been convicted of a felony.

385
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,780
那都是胡說八道
That was bullshit.

386
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,650
雖然我明白 但我還是同意你的觀點
Word up, though, I get that, man.

387
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,020
就像 噗 我有過類似的經歷
Like, pfft, I had a similar thing.

388
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,390
他們認定我就是個兒童性犯罪者
They tried to peg me as a child sex offender.

389
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,300
那真是瞎扯淡
It was total bullshit.

390
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,300
哦 喂 喂 喂 我可不喜歡兒童性犯罪者
Oh, yo, yo, yo. I ain't down with no kid-fuckers.

391
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,310
我當然對兒童沒有那種意思
I'm not down with kid shit either.

392
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,460
嗯 我們都沒有
Yeah, none of us are.

393
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,260
真的沒有 伙伴
N-to-the-O, brother.

394
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,660
他在我們這裡不通過
We do not support that at all.

395
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,020
呃 我們就給他這份工作吧 我僅僅是...
But, you know, let's just give the guy a job.

396
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,740
呃 不想讓這個伙伴沮喪
Just... Yeah. I don't wanna upset this guy.

397
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,980
蒂芙尼 告訴你 你被僱傭了
Well, tell you what, Tiffany. You're hired.

398
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,340
- 我被僱傭了嗎 - 是啊
- I'm hired? - Yeah, you are.

399
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,940
- 行了 就這樣 - 哦 謝謝
- There you go. There you go. - Oh, thank you.

400
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,820
我們稍後週一再見 你可以離開了
We'll see you later. See you Monday. Get out of here.

401
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,420
庫爾特 你別僱傭惹火卻沒有經驗的女人了
Kurt, you gotta stop hiring hot unqualified women.

402
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,840
如果不讓美女簇擁周圍
What's the point of being boss

403
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,300
那麼你當老闆的意義何在呢
if you can't stock the pond?

404
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,140
如果沒有這些女人 你就夜不能寐嗎
You realize you can't sleep with these women?

405
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,180
- 你說什麼 - 作為老闆 你這是性騷擾
- What? - You're the boss. It's sexual harassment.

406
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,440
還記得性騷擾的事情嗎
Remember sexual harassment?

407
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,340
我差點殺了我老闆 還有印象嗎
I tried to kill my boss. Ring a bell?

408
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,620
我要把她們都解僱了嗎 我才剛僱傭了她們啊
I gotta fire them all now? We just hired them.

409
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,860
你不能解僱她們因為你不能和她們滾床單
You can't fire them because you're not allowed to sleep with them.

410
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,140
同樣因為性騷擾事件
Also sexual harassment.

411
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,460
我們為什麼要這樣做呢
Why are we even doing this, then?

412
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,540
好了 下面談一下著裝標準
All right, let's talk dress code.

413
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,900
- 這個無關緊要 - 這裡沒有著裝標準
- Forget it. - There is no dress code.

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,660
- 來吧 - 想怎麼穿就怎麼穿
- Come on. - You can dress however you want.

415
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,550
只要自己感覺舒服...
Whatever makes you feel comfortable...

416
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,340
呃 那個把襯衫脫了 好吧
Well, there goes a shirt. All right.

417
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,700
- 這是種選擇 - 呃...
- It's a choice. - Well...

418
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,150
但這是種錯誤的選擇
That's the wrong choice, though.

419
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,180
把襯衫穿上 那才是正確的...
Gotta wear a shirt. That's the one...

420
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,110
他正在離我越來越遠
He's walking away from me.

421
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,580
他可能是個壞員工
He might have been a bad hire.

422
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,060
誰玩得那麼開心啊
Who's having fun?

423
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,340
嘿 伙伴們
Hey, guys.

424
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,900
每個人看起來都很開心 這是個不錯的主意
Everybody seems very happy. This was a great idea.

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,460
嗯 我知道 但這也會成為一個問題
Yeah, I know. This could be an issue, though.

426
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,140
帶著孩子來工作 不是把孩子放在這裡工作
It is Bring Your Kids to Work Day, not Put Your Kids to Work Day.

427
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,620
他們不是在工作 他們把這個當做為一個遊戲
They're not working. They consider this playing.

428
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,580
我告訴他們停下 但一說他們就哭
I tried to tell them to stop, and they started crying.

429
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,180
他們已經裝了1200套了
They have boxed 1200 units already.

430
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,580
非專業... 1200套
Unethical... 1200?

431
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,580
- 是的 - 好吧 儘管如此 挺多產的
- Yeah. - Well, that's productive, though.

432
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,580
- 是的 - 他們看起來還挺開心的
- Yeah. - And they seem happy.

433
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,720
也許我應該讓他們多玩個10分鐘
Let them play another ten minutes, maybe.

434
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,540
我認為應該讓他們玩一整個中午
I say we let them play through lunch.

435
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,140
- 是的 從法律上講我得變下那個標牌 - 嗯
- Yeah. Legally I think I'll change the sign. - Yeah.

436
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,060
哦 哥們 就是它
Oh, boy. This is it.

437
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,830
走起 走起
Here we go. Here we go.

438
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,940
- 我們做到了 我們做夠十萬套了- 我做到了嗎
- We did it. We're at 100,000. - We did it?

439
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,180
- 是的 - 給我看看
- Yeah. - Let me see.

440
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,220
喔嚯嚯
Woo-hoo-hoo!

441
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,560
這主意太棒了
This is a great idea.

442
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,180
你們認為他會對此事不高興嗎
How do you think they mow this?

443
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,220
你認為我們不應該提前打電話嗎
Sure we shouldn't have called ahead?

444
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,260
不 他會喜歡的
No. He's gonna love it.

445
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,740
蛋糕和氣球 我們是不是做得太過了點
Cake and balloons. Don't think that's overdoing it?

446
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
不 我想他一定會為訂單提早三天完成
No. I think he's gonna

447
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,140
而感到興奮鼓舞的
be psyched the order's done three days early.

448
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,180
按照他的預計進程 他看到我們在這裡會瘋掉的
I think he's gonna be flipping out to see us out on his course.

449
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,980
如果他給我們會員資格的話 我是不會感到驚奇的
I wouldn't be surprised if he gives us a membership.

450
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,340
- 你沒開玩笑吧 - 沒有啊
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

451
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,740
天啊 我想要會員資格
Oh, my God. I want that.

452
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,860
太棒了
Yeah!

453
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,260
驚喜來啦 哈哈
Surprise. Ha, ha.

454
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,310
先生 我們已經完成了您的訂單
Sir, we finished your order

455
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,350
貨物正在等候船運
and it is ready to be shipped.

456
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,300
這消息真棒
Excellent news.

457
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,300
我們給您帶了個小蛋糕 上面寫著
We got you a little cake that says,

458
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,620
"感謝您對我們的信任"
"Thanks for believing in us!"

459
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,020
- 當然了 還有一些氣球 - 我們三個就是那個"我們"
- And some balloons of course. - We're the "us."

460
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,700
小伙子們 恭喜你們 成就非凡
Congratulations, boys. What an accomplishment.

461
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,390
- 謝謝您 - 謝謝
- Thank you. - Thanks.

462
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,420
我還以為得把訂單取消了呢
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel that order.

463
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,820
他說的什麼
What'd he say?

464
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,460
- 聽著好像說的是"取消訂單" - 什麼
- Sounded like he said "cancel the order." - What?

465
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,230
- 取消什麼 - 取消訂單
- Cancel what? - Cancel the order.

466
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,980
我不需要它了
Don't need it.

467
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,500
- 不 等下 你這話起不了作用 - 你不能夠這麼做
- Wait, no. That doesn't work. - You can't do that.

468
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,510
- 我們財務負債了五百萬美元 - 我們還在做買賣呢
- We went 500 grand in the hole. - We were in business.

469
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,800
你要不買的話 我們就愧於一旦了
If you don't buy, we are ruined.

470
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,340
這可是筆五十萬美元的單子
It's a $500,000 order.

471
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,140
這就是他所謂的美國夢哈
The American dream and all that.

472
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,100
他就要擊球了 他僅僅是要擊球
He's gonna putt. He's just gonna putt.

473
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,180
- 他擊球了 - 你可以解釋下發生什麼了嗎
- He makes the putt. - Can you explain what's happening?

474
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,260
- 你為什麼要這麼做 - 嗯 是 好問題
- And why you're doing this? - Yeah, sure. Fair question.

475
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,180
小伙兒們 你們看 你們的過渡性融資一週後就要到期了...
You see, boys, in one week your bridge loan comes due...

476
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,980
但你們卻無力償還
and you won't be able to pay it.

477
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,670
你們的信貸員已經向我保證
And your loan officer has assured me

478
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,620
不會再貸給你們錢了
no extension will be granted.

479
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,780
到那個時候 你們的公司就會喪失抵押品贖回權...
At that moment, your company will go into foreclosure...

480
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,330
接著我會用美元以極低的價格在拍賣會上
and I will buy all of those units at auction

481
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,420
買光所有這些設備
for pennies on the dollar.

482
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,100
這比我從中國那裡買要便宜
Cheaper than I could have gotten them from the Chinese.

483
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,340
- 噢 我的天啊 - 這是真的嗎
- Oh, my fucking God. - I can't believe this.

484
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,260
另外 作為附加的紅利 你們的專利也將屬於我...
Anyway, as an added bonus, I will also own your patent...

485
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,810
而這兩位先生將
and these gentlemen here will

486
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,900
接管生產我們的新產品
take over manufacturing of our new product:

487
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,420
"浴室小伙伴"
The Shower Pal.

488
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,060
- 這名字更好聽點 - 是的
- It's a better name too. - It is.

489
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,580
- 真該死 - 我去
- Goddamn it. - Fucking hell.

490
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,140
噢 老爸  這真是個該死的遊戲
Oh, Dad, that is a hell of a fucking play.

491
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,290
我們應該給他們授以王冠
We should fit these guys for crowns

492
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,340
因為他們剛被莊重地調戲過
because they just got fucked royally.

493
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,080
雷克斯 不要在這裡賣弄
Rex. No call for this MTV showboating.

494
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,340
對於他們自己的失敗 他們心知肚明
They're aware of their defeat.

495
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,740
這種時候 不說話是更為有力的
In these moments, it's more impactful to be still.

496
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,010
既然如此 你所說的關於努力工作
What about that stuff about hard work

497
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,780
以及在美國白手起家的事情是真的嗎
and starting a company in America?

498
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,180
- 美國夢和努力工作 - 全是胡說八道嗎
- The American dream and hard work. - All bullshit?

499
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,460
你真的以為努力工作能夠創造財富嗎
You honestly think hard work creates wealth?

500
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,700
唯一能夠創造財富的就是財富本身
The only thing that creates wealth is wealth.

501
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,460
但是我們有 而你們沒有
And we have it. You don't.

502
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,140
好吧 好吧 你知道嗎
Okay. Okay. You know what?

503
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,660
- 別激動 別激動 - 我明白 喂
- Take it easy. Take it easy. - I got it. Hey.

504
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,460
聽著 老土霸 你不想與我們為敵 是嗎
Listen, bucko. You don't wanna make enemies out of us, okay?

505
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,980
喔 別激動 我不是衝著你來的
Whoa, easy. I didn't walk all up on you.

506
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,460
我每天都有新的敵人 這就是做生意
I make new enemies every day. It's called business.

507
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,420
小伙們 謝謝你們的到訪 祝你們今天過得愉快
Thank you, gentlemen, for stopping by. Have a lovely day.

508
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,860
雷克斯 把蛋糕拿走
Rex, get the cake.

509
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,300
有錢人都不要臉 去它媽的經濟收入超水準 混蛋
Rich motherfucking, overprivileged, fucking assholes.

510
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,300
人的正直去哪裡了
What happened to decency?

511
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,900
- 我就要失去我的房子了 - 是
- I'm gonna lose my house. - Yeah.

512
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,370
史黛西就要和我離婚了
Stacy's gonna divorce me.

513
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,540
她要嫁給一個花花公子了
She's gonna marry some dude.

514
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,690
我以後去個麥當勞也要被人監視了
I'll have supervised visits at McDonald's.

515
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,660
去它的麥當勞
Fucking McDonald's.

516
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,810
我們過去都在想什麼
What were we thinking?

517
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,170
怎麼把賭注下到他們身上了呢
Who bets on themselves?

518
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,980
我們為什麼那樣做
Why did we do that?

519
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,500
- 你說什麼 - 你就是那時候說服我的那個人
- What? - You're the one who talked me into it.

520
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,980
我那時候中立
I was on the fence.

521
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,740
我們被耍了 我們的員工被耍了
We're fucked! Our employees are fucked.

522
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,340
他們呢 盧佩呢
What about them? What about Lupe?

523
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,540
這只是一個問題
This is just a problem.

524
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,300
我們所需要做的就是想出這個問題的解決辦法
That means all we gotta do is come up with a solution.

525
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,180
我們可以把想法寫到這塊板上
We'll put some ideas up on the board.

526
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,060
這正是我要說的 說做就做 來吧
That's what I'm talking about. Here we go. Let's go.

527
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,730
沒有主意才是最糟糕的
No idea's a bad idea.

528
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,180
沒有主意才是最糟糕的
No idea's a bad idea.

529
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,060
- 誰先開始說 - 我來
- Who's gonna start us off? - I got it.

530
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,940
- 庫爾特你來 - 把這幫畜生宰了
- Kurt. - Kill these motherfuckers.

531
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,180
- 不 不 - 宰了他們 對
- No, no. - Murder! Yes.

532
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,580
- 你不必把它寫下來 - 宰了他們
- You don't need to write that down. - Kill them.

533
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
我們去宰了他們 我要把他們弄死
Let's fucking kill them! I want them dead!

534
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,350
宰了他們
Kill them.

535
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,030
切開他們的腦袋再用力扔到一邊去...
We open up their brains and shove them...

536
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,140
然後干他們的頭蓋兒
Then we fuck the skulls!

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
那種快感越來越強烈 尼克
I'm getting that taste, Nick.

538
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,500
他們死啦
They're fucking dead!

539
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,060
我們再來一遍
We're fucking doing it again!

540
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,020
這就是芝加哥處理方式
That's the Chicago way!

541
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,990
芝加哥處理方式
Chicago way!

542
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,580
把他們的腦袋切開 我想弄死他一家
Cut them open. I want his family dead.

543
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,540
我要把他的房子點了 我就能拿到棒球棒了
I want his house burned down, and I'll get a baseball bat.

544
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,180
- 來吧 伙伴 來吧 - 干他們的頭蓋兒
- Come on, man, come on. - Fuck their skulls!

545
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,580
- 來啊 - 來啊
- Come on. - Come on.

546
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,540
我們去宰了他們
We'll fucking kill them.

547
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,070
如果我們要對自身進行了解的話
If we've learned one thing about ourselves,

548
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,700
那麼首先應該明白的就是我們不是殺手
it's that we're not murderers.

549
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
殺了他們怎麼能讓我們的錢回來呢
How does killing them get us our money?

550
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,580
你什麼意思
What do you mean?

551
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,300
你帶走他們的器官 然後拿它們到黑市上賣
You harvest their organs, sell them on the black market.

552
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,440
嚴肅點 伙伴們 這樣是無濟於事的
Be fucking serious. Come on. This is not helpful.

553
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,580
我們要認真地思考下
Think seriously.

554
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,340
你說得對 很多事情都有人做過了
You're right. There's other things people have done.

555
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,900
- 得有秘密計劃 - 為了我們的錢
- There's plots. - For money.

556
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
電影速度的秘密計劃
The plot of the movie Speed.

557
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
對 就這樣 把炸彈放在巴士上
Yes, there you go. Put a bomb on a bus.

558
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,100
所以我們得操縱住一輛巴士
So we'll rig a bus so that

559
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,180
當它時速低於五十米每小時時 讓它引爆
when it goes below 50 miles an hour, it blows up.

560
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,940
- 什麼濫主意 - 你說沒主意才是最糟糕的
- What the fuck is that? - You said no idea was a bad idea.

561
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,940
我錯了 這主意太爛了 電影很爛 你也很爛
I was wrong. That idea sucks, the movie sucks and so do you.

562
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,420
這個電影讓我們想起了桑迪·布洛克
That movie introduced us to Sandy Bullock.

563
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,180
去你的 我愛桑德拉·布洛克 我已熱血沸騰
Fuck you! I love Sandra Bullock! I'm running hot.

564
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,780
抱歉 我已經熱火沸騰了
I'm sorry. I'm running hot.

565
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,420
整件事情都他媽讓我心煩意亂
The whole fucking thing's got me upset.

566
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,540
把筆給我 我會想到更好的辦法
Give me the marker, I'll get a better idea.

567
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,230
想要筆嗎 給我五十萬美元
Want the marker? Give me $500,000,

568
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,220
那才是我們需要的
that's what we need.

569
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,660
想要那支筆的贖金嗎
Gonna hold the marker ransom?

570
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,900
你愛怎麼說怎麼說吧
Call it what you want.

571
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,310
我需要五十萬美元
I need a half a million dollars.

572
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,940
我需要的不是什麼鬼主意或在這裡閒扯淡
I don't need shit ideas and a bunch of hot air.

573
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,660
來吧
Come on.

574
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,300
黛爾
Dale.

575
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,380
- 嘣嘣 筆掉了 - "拐騙罪"
- Boom. Marker drop. - "Kidnaping."

576
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,640
這是"綁架"
That's "kidnapping."

577
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,590
你說的是多了個P的那個詞
With one more P it is.

578
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,620
這個是"拐騙罪"
That's "kidnaping."

579
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,130
管你他媽怎麼拼呢
However the fuck you spell it.

580
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,660
你知道我在說什麼 就是綁架 走起
You know what I'm talking about. Kidnapping. Come on.

581
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
等下 這主意不錯
Wait a second. That's a fucking great idea.

582
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,260
先想想 首先 我們要綁架雷克斯
Think about it. First of all, we kidnap Rex.

583
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,220
- 然後向伯特要錢 - 贖金
- We get money from Bert. - Ransom money.

584
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,380
如此我們還省事了
We save the business.

585
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,540
也沒有人會死
No one has to die.

586
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,620
- 沒有人會受傷 - 他是伯特的孩子
- Nobody gets hurt. - He is the kid of Bert.

587
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,300
對 而且他年齡也不算很小
Right, but he's not super young.

588
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,120
這樣做不會顯得太白痴
So it's not super douchey and shit.

589
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,580
而且危害也不是最大
It's not all molesty and shit.

590
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,780
你們知道如何實施綁架嗎
What do you know about executing a kidnapping?

591
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,580
- 你什麼意思 你只要... - 用拉鏈綁
- What do you mean? You just... - You get zip ties.

592
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,780
你們關於綁架一無所知
You don't know shit about kidnapping.

593
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,280
好吧 我們知道的不多
Okay, we don't know a ton.

594
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,340
但是敢打賭 我們知道有人深諳其道
But I bet we know someone that does.

595
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,180
- 誰 - 壞蛋瓊斯
- Who? - Motherfucker Jones.

596
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,900
- 哦 天啊 - 去找他不好嗎
- Oh, Jesus. - Wouldn't it be good to see him?

597
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,320
我們不會去找混蛋瓊斯
We're not gonna go see Motherfucker Jones

598
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,820
因為我們也不會"綁架"任何人
 because we're not gonna "kidnape" anyone.

599
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,940
得了吧 這個傢伙在對問題的處理上是個蠢貨
Come on, this guy's a master business prick.

600
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,870
他正處於事業的巔峰 我們得明白...
He's at the top of his game. We need to figure out...

601
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,500
伙伴們 看看這都是什麼
Boy, look what we got.

602
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,940
是用記號筆寫的嗎
Is that a Sharpie?

603
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,840
等下 記號筆怎麼會在那裡呢
Hang on. What was a Sharpie doing there?

604
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,860
你把它放那裡的
You put it there.

605
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,020
我的確把它放到那裡了
I did put it on there.

606
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,430
是你負責管理記號筆的
You're in charge of marker distribution.

607
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,060
我知道我就是那個看記號筆的人
I know I'm the marker guy.

608
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,780
現在擦不掉了
Permanently on the board now.

609
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,450
這讓我想出了一個方法 笨蛋們
This illustrates my point, idiots.

610
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,340
我們需要找到一個合法人
We need to find somebody who's legitimate.

611
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,020
我們需要找到一個能夠讓我們的公司回來的人
We need to find someone who can get us our company back.

612
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,540
嗨 尼克...
Hello, Nick...

613
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,260
一個傢伙是救了我性命...
guy who saved my life...

614
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,220
一個傢伙是上了我老婆
guy who fucked my wife.

615
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,340
那是爭吵 僅僅是爭吵 我沒有上她
It was a blow job. It was a blow job, only. Didn't fuck her.

616
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,700
你收到我的郵件了嗎
You got my e-mail?

617
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,900
收到了 而且我被它逗得樂不可支
I did. And I was very amused by it.

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,930
我知道伯特·漢森
I know Bert Hanson.

619
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,220
我希望你們能夠重創他
I like the cut of his jib.

620
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,370
但是我欣賞他把你們三個白痴
And I admire the way he bent you three idiots

621
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,220
玩弄於股掌並讓你們死得明白的行為方式
over a barrel and showed you the 50 states.

622
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,900
- 明白了 跟你說過這是個俗語 - 哇哦
- See? Told you it was a saying. - Wow.

623
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,340
尼克 現在回答我幾個問題
Now, Nick, just tell me something.

624
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,620
你為什麼在對方還沒保證
Why would you start production...

625
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,540
給你墊付至少百分之三十五的製造成本之前
without at least a guarantee of 35 percent down...

626
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,700
就開始生產了呢
to cover manufacturing costs?

627
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,100
我是說 你為什麼那麼做
I mean, why would you do that?

628
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,660
- 他在講笑話嗎 - 有什麼搞笑的事情嗎
- Is he telling a joke? - Is something funny?

629
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,140
我們以為我們遇到好人了...
We assumed that we were dealing with somebody who was ethical...

630
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,260
不 你回答錯了 正確的答案是因為...
No, that's the wrong answer. The right answer is because...

631
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,060
你們都是白痴
you're all fucking morons.

632
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,820
哥們 他提出自己的觀點了 對嗎
Boy, he shined a light on that, didn't he?

633
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,220
你說得對 你說得很對
That's true. You're absolutely right.

634
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,980
你以為我是一個很差勁的老闆
You thought I was such a bad boss.

635
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,050
但我可不這麼認為
But, I don't know,

636
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,540
我認為也許你們把自己的公司經營得一敗塗地...
I think running your own company into the ground...

637
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,250
毀掉你們員工的生計可能會更加糟糕
ruining the livelihood of your employees is maybe a bit worse.

638
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,100
你覺得呢
What do you think?

639
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,920
你說得對
That's fair.

640
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,100
我是不是應該在你們打電話的時候做記錄呢
Should I be on the phone if I'm taking notes?

641
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,470
我完全聽不到他說的任何話
I'm not getting any of what he's saying.

642
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,140
都是一些誇張的問題
It's just a lot of rhetorical questions.

643
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,260
那麼你想從我這裡得到點什麼 尼克
So, what do you want from me, Nick?

644
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,300
無意冒犯 我想你知道他是個什麼樣的人
With all due respect, you know what makes a guy like that tick.

645
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,510
如果你能給我們提些
So if you could give us some advice on

646
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,740
如何把我們的錢弄回來的建議的話...
how to get our money back...

647
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,570
我會在你下次假釋聽證會上表現得特別棒
I will play real nice at your next parole hearing.

648
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,860
這聽起來感覺怎麼樣
How does that sound?

649
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,660
- 你會為我做那些事情嗎 - 是的 我會
- You would do that for me? - Yes, I would.

650
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,900
好的 我想我能幫你
Okay. I think I can help you.

651
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,940
他要幫我們嗎
He's gonna help?

652
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,980
好 我帶了筆記本 我帶了筆記本
Okay, I got a notepad. I got a notepad.

653
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,540
從法律的角度上講...
From a legal standpoint...

654
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,820
"法律的角度"
"Legal standpoint."

655
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,580
...你的選擇是...
...your options are...

656
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,980
...吃屎去吧
...jack fucking shit.

657
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,420
我聽到了"傑克·維茨" 是律師嗎
I heard "Jack Leibowitz." Is that an attorney?

658
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
我會寫下來的
I'll write that down.

659
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,100
能告訴我們他的聯絡方式嗎
Can we get his contact info?

660
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,620
即使你們有錢跟他對簿公堂
Even if you had the money to fight him in the courts...

661
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,060
他的律師也會在你們三個小嘍囉
his lawyers are just gonna file motions and continuances...

662
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,860
燒光腦細胞之後
long after you three pissant little fuckups...

663
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,060
不斷申訴
have blown your tiny little brains out.

664
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,740
你是說一切已成定局了嗎
You saying nothing can be done?

665
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,060
不是 我是說你們屁事也乾不成
No, I said there's nothing you can do.

666
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,580
想要力挽狂瀾有很多出路 但你們屁事也乾不成
There's plenty that could be done, but you won't do it.

667
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,660
- 你想知道為什麼嗎 - 不想
- And do you wanna know why? - No, not really.

668
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,940
- 因為你們是沒蛋的傢伙 - 懂了
- Because you have no balls. - I see.

669
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,940
你們的爹也沒蛋
And your fathers had no balls.

670
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,060
你們都是一群沒蛋的人養的兒子
You are all a product of generations of ball-less men...

671
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,200
懦弱無能 不敢揭竿而起
who were too weak or too frightened to stand up

672
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,740
奪回屬於自己的東西
and take what was theirs.

673
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,460
總有一天 你們會一命嗚呼
And one day, you will pass on...

674
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,460
把你空空蕩蕩 皺皺巴巴的陰囊留給你們可憐的兒子
your empty, shriveled sacs to your own pitiful offspring.

675
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,080
我聽不見啊 他在說什麼
I can't hear. What is he talking about?

676
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,500
說我們的陰囊 大部分是
Our nut sacs, mostly.

677
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,660
怎麼會說到這個
How'd that come up?

678
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,480
你怎麼不提綁架的事
Why don't you pitch him the kidnapping?

679
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,780
別提綁架這事了
Let the kidnapping go.

680
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,580
- 快說綁架的事 - 有點種 行嗎
- Pitch him the kidnapping. - Show some balls, all right?

681
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,260
想看蛋蛋 去綁架個人來看吧
Wanna see balls? Kidnap someone.

682
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,060
然後你鋃鐺入獄 會有很多蛋蛋在你眼前晃的
You'll end up in here. You'll see plenty of balls on your forehead.

683
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,060
為什麼在我眼前晃
Why are they on my forehead?

684
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,340
- 丁丁是在我頭上嗎 - 胡說八道
- Was the dick on top of my head? - Makes no sense.

685
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,570
哦我倒過來了
Oh, I'm upside down.

686
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,350
絕逼是的 你的臉要被幹了
You sure are. Your face is getting fucked.

687
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,700
媽蛋
Motherfucker.

688
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,900
你打算用那筆贖金挽救你們的事業
So y'all plan to use the ransom to save your business.

689
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
- 正事 就是這樣的 - 我們是這樣打算的
- Exactly, yeah. That's it. - That's what we're hoping.

690
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,590
你能告訴這兩個傻逼那樣有多傻逼嗎 謝謝
Will you tell these idiots how stupid that is, please?

691
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,940
我喜歡
I like it.

692
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,620
- 太棒了 看見了吧 - 我就知道他喜歡
- Nice. See? - I knew he'd like it.

693
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,580
你總得努力讓公司繼續運轉
You're doing what you need to to keep your business going.

694
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,180
我早就夢想開家自己的公司
I had a dream for a long time to get my own business.

695
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,380
就是啊
Yeah.

696
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,020
我想開自己的莓果冰淇淋店
I wanted to open my own Pinkberry.

697
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,020
- 你他媽的笑什麼 - 我以為你在搞笑
- What the fuck is the chuckles about? - Oh, I thought you were joking.

698
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,620
你知道有多少妞排隊買那個嘎吱嘎吱船長
See how many crackers line up to

699
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,940
上面蓋著一坨冰凍的翔
get that Captain Crunch-covered freezing shit?

700
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,280
我一週吃三次 我超愛莓果冰淇淋
I eat it three times a week. I love Pinkberry.

701
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,900
超牛逼的
Hey, that's awesome.

702
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,140
- 你喜歡莓果冰淇淋 - 我有乳糖不耐症
- You like Pinkberry? - I'm lactose intolerant.

703
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,340
- 好吧 - 你長了個非洲裔美國人的肚子嗎
- Right. - You got an African-American belly?

704
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,780
- 黑人就不能吃乳糖 - 這樣啊 好吧
- Because black people suffer from lactose. - Oh, okay, good, well...

705
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,300
- 我們有點親戚關係 - 不錯啊
- We got some kind of kinship. - Yeah, cool, man.

706
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,140
- 拉得出屎嗎 - 這個可以
- Stool soft? - It can be.

707
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,980
- 屁股軟嗎 - 挺軟的
- Bottom tender. - Yeah, bottom's fine.

708
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,070
如果有人搶了我的莓果冰淇淋
If somebody took my Pinkberry,

709
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,220
我不會善罷甘休的
I wouldn't take that sitting down.

710
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,260
- 你得揭竿而起 - 我會把那傻貨長的劈成兩半
- You would fight. - I will cut a motherfucker in half.

711
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,120
你不會綁架的
You wouldn't kidnap someone

712
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,140
因為你根本辦不成
because you can't successfully pull it off.

713
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,340
說個講綁架的電影來聽聽
Name me a kidnapping movie...

714
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,580
而且結局是綁匪沒翹辮子也沒坐牢
where the kidnappers weren't dead or incarcerated at the end.

715
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,260
- 朝九晚五 你個沒屁眼的 - 朝九晚五
- 9 to 5, asshole. - 9 to 5.

716
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,100
- 那再說一個 - 你說了一個就行的
- Name me two movies, then. - You said name one.

717
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,260
- 我剛剛就說了一個 - 朝九晚五這個電影...
- I nailed one right on you. - 9 to 5 was this movie...

718
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,850
我知道朝九晚五
I know what the fuck 9 to 5 is.

719
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,100
是講那個大奶子的白人婊子
It's about the white bitch with the big titties.

720
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,690
是啊
Yeah.

721
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,380
她雖然人老珠黃 奶子還是不錯的
She got old, the titties stayed young.

722
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,700
我不會看了朝九晚五就去綁票
I'm not gonna kidnap someone based on 9 to 5.

723
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,620
- 那是因為你是簡·方達[著名演員] - 你就是膽小鬼
- That's because you Jane Fonda. - You're the scaredy-cat one.

724
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,580
你就是最沒用的 老是拖拖拉拉
You're always the last to man up. You're dragging your feet.

725
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,340
你都不想參與你在這幹嘛
Why are you here if you're not gonna participate?

726
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,830
首先 如果這裡有人長了腦子的話
First of all, if anyone,

727
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,500
就是我 我是莉莉·湯姆林[美國女影星]
I'm the smart one. I'm Lily Tomlin.

728
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,040
我不想跟你說了
But I won't have this conversation.

729
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,220
算了吧 老子是莉莉·湯姆林
Please, I'm Lily Tomlin, if anybody is.

730
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,020
坐在大椅子上 鳥都不鳥大衛·O·拉塞爾[90年代喜劇演員]
Sitting in the big chair, giving David O. Russell shit.

731
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,520
就是啊 他有點上道了 你是莉莉·湯姆林
Yeah, he's got the 'tude. You're Fonda, man.

732
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,180
你是方達
You're Jane Fonda.

733
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,170
那你就是桃莉·芭頓
That makes you Dolly Parton.

734
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,380
太好了 這女人自娛自樂啊
Great. Woman's got her own theme park.

735
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,940
- 她簡直是國寶 - 倆國寶
- She's a national treasure. - Two national treasures.

736
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,460
我能問你們這些殖民者一個問題嗎
Can I pose a question to you colonizers?

737
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,750
猴年馬月的事了
Happened a long time ago.

738
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,180
你要怎麼綁架一個人
How do you kidnap somebody without them knowing...

739
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,180
還不讓他知道自己被綁架了
they've been kidnapped?

740
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,820
- 好的 - 你少裝蒜了 你又沒綁架過
- Okay. - You smarten up, and you don't even do it.

741
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,680
他是個黑人獅身人面像 我喜歡
He's a black sphinx. I like it.

742
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,830
他給我們指點迷津了
He threw a riddle our way.

743
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,420
- 你怎麼... - 巫術 巫術怎麼樣
- How do you...? - Voodoo. Voodoo?

744
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,540
我可以告訴你們答案
I can give you the answers.

745
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,860
- 五萬塊 - 不是吧
- Fifty thousand. - No.

746
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,500
- 辦不到 - 六百怎樣
- We can't. - Six hundred?

747
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,740
你就不該開莓果冰淇淋店 不好意思了
You should not run a Pinkberry. Sorry.

748
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,420
- 這簡直是最奇怪的溝通方式 - 我們沒錢
- The weirdest negotiating style. - We don't have money.

749
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,260
我們到這裡來就是因為我們身無分文 我們破產了
You know, we're here because we have zero dollars. We're broke.

750
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,780
媽蛋 把手錶給我
Fuck it. Give me the watch.

751
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,260
- 不要 - 手錶給他
- Nope. - Give him your watch.

752
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,760
我才不給他 這可是豪雅表
I'm not giving him this. This is a Tag Heuer.

753
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,260
這就是個沒戴手錶的手腕
This is a wrist without a watch.

754
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,260
給他吧 錢財這種東西生不帶來死不帶去
Come on. It's just material things. Can't take it with you.

755
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,940
既然你給我們出餿主意 我就借給你
You can borrow it while you tell us a shitty plan.

756
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,460
好吧
All right.

757
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,580
給他下藥
Slip him a mickey.

758
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,740
還我手錶
Give me the watch back.

759
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,460
你半夜溜進他家
You sneak into his crib at night.

760
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,660
看看他睡覺之前都喝什麼
Find out whatever his beverage of choice is before he goes to bed.

761
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,340
在飲料裡下點藥 隨時把他搞定
You slip the mickey in the beverage. Knock him out nice and easy.

762
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,580
他爹不給錢 你們就別讓他醒過來
And you keep that bitch sedated until Daddy pays up.

763
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,380
這主意還湊合 但可不值一隻瑞士手錶
It's not a crazy idea, but it's not worth a Swiss watch.

764
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,380
- 能行得通的 - 太棒了 絕逼好主意
- That could work. - That's great. That makes total sense.

765
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,900
- 他又看不見我們長什麼樣 - 我們就像幽靈一樣 根本不存在
- He doesn't see our faces. - We're ghosts. We don't even exist.

766
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,170
你說的"藥"是什麼藥
When you say "mickey... "?

767
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,900
一種約會是強姦姑娘用的藥 你上哪裡搞的
A date-rape drug. Where do you get those?

768
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,260
- 我上哪裡搞 - 是啊
- Where do I get them? - Yeah.

769
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,620
因為我是黑鬼我就知道上哪裡搞這種藥
Because of the hue of my skin I know where to get date-rape drugs?

770
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,820
- 這事是你提的 - 你眼裡在說N詞
- You brought up the date-raping. - You got N word in your eyes.

771
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,340
- 你為什麼要說N詞 - 三K黨眼

她用什麼弄昏你的 笑氣嗎

- 我覺得只能這麼玩 - 有道理啊
- I think that's the only way to play it. - It makes sense.

如果條子查這些字母是哪裡來的
To throw the cops off if they start snooping

801
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,780
我們就可以瞞過他們
to figure out where the letters came from.

802
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,060
- 多拉探險家對講機 - 牛逼啊

804
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,100
用手機吧
Let's use our phones.

805
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,060

It's just the three of us doing this, not us and the NSA.

809
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,100

我就交代了你要買橡膠手套
It's the only thing you went in there to buy.

815
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,180
她辦公室裡一堆手套呢
She's got a ton of gloves in her office.

用那些就行了
We'll just use those.

817
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,300
你得有手套才能進去 才能不留下指紋
You need them to get inside, so we don't leave fingerprints.

818

- 為什麼啊 - 別的頻道上可能有人叫尼克啊
- Why not? - Could be somebody on the frequency.

831
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,220

姓也別叫
And there's the last name.

834
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,260
- 我們得想個暗號啊 - 就是啊
- We should come up with code names. - Absolutely.

835
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,330
尼克 你想要什麼暗號
Nick, where you landing on code names?

836

你別再叫我名字我就很高興了
I'd love it if you'd stop saying my name.

837
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,180
- 拿上笑氣就趕快閃人吧 - 收到
- Just get the gas and get out here. - Roger that.

838
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,540
"刀鋒劍士"搞定目標
The Blade has acquired the target.

839
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,340
- 是用的劍嗎 - 那是我的暗號啊 尼克
- Was that "The Blade"? - That's my code name, Nick.

840
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,420
我們不需要暗號 大家都知道誰在說話
We don't need code names. Everybody knows who's talking.

841
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,500

They're sounding pretty cool, so let's try to land on a couple.

I'm coming in at you with The Majestic Lion. I'm gonna be The Majestic Lion.

現在是我們在說話
Now we're talking.

845
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,740
我不會那樣叫你的
Not gonna call you that.

846
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,860
你真混蛋 你最好給我想一個好理由
That's a bummer there. I'm gonna need a reason as to why.

847
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,020
因為你不是叢林之貓 簡直傻逼
Because you're not a jungle cat, and it's stupid as shit.

848
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,460
- 有道理 - 接的好
- Fair point. - Good catch.

849
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,300
我們得給他想一個暗號

You know what? What if I drop the "Lion"?

- 有人來了 有人來了 - 只要光叫"王"嗎
- Somebody's here. Somebody's here. - Just The Majestic?

854
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,060
我太愛了 我喜歡
I love that. I like that.

855
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,500
別再說暗號的事了
Shut up about the code names.

856
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,420

操 倆傻逼
Fuck. Fucking idiots.

863

不是我的錯 不是我的錯
It's not my fault. It's not my goddamn fault.

- 我覺得那是雞籠 - 什麼
- The coop, I think. - What?

871
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,620
"我的天 我的天"聽著像個不錯的暗號
The "my God, my God" does sounds like a thing.

872

他還說他不喜歡暗號
For a guy not into code names...

905
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,300

would you like to share with us what's led you into recovery?

911
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,260
好吧 我是有個很大的問題
Well, okay. I do have a very big problem.

912
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,980
困擾我很久了 很久了
Just been hitting it hard. I've been hitting it hard.

913
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,420
他以為他是在戒酒互助會呢
He thinks he's in an AA meeting.

914
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,740
經常和一群人鬼混
Getting together with the guys.

915
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,820
每次都不省人事
Oftentimes, ending up just face down.

916
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,180
一次接著一次 有的時候甚至還要加倍
Chugging one after the other. Sometimes double-fisted, just:

917
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,020
你知道吧 知道我在說什麼吧
You know? You know what I'm talking about.

918
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,420
所以你的性癮 是天生的同性戀性癮嗎
So your sexual addiction, it's homosexual in nature?

919
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,060
我的性癮 我的...
My sex addiction? My sex addiction is...

920
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,460
你剛說什麼來著
And then what did you say?

921
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,020
- 你喜歡上男人 - 不是 我喜歡女人
- You like to fuck guys. - No. My sex addiction is to ladies.

922
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,860
- 哦 - 我對女人很上癮
- Oh. - You know. I'm addicted to women.

923
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,100
真無聊
Boring.

924
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,820
- 操 我想尿尿 - 什麼
- Oh, fuck, I have to piss. - What?

I have to piss. I'm nervous. I'm sorry.

926
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,700
- 去吧 去尿 - 聲音會很大的
- Go, go, just pee. - It's gonna make too much noise.

927
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,580
不會的 去廁所裡尿
No, no, just dip your dick into the toilet.

928
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,140
- 坐著尿 好吧 - 是啊 去吧
- Oh, sit down and do it? Okay. - Yeah, yeah.

929
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,060
- 搆不到 - 什麼
- It doesn't reach. - What?

930
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,380
搆不到啊 應該搆得到嗎
It doesn't reach. Should it reach?

931
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,180
我不知道應不應該
I mean, I don't know if it's about "should," but...

932
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,540
- 我要把座墊拿起來了 - 對 把座墊拿起來
- I'll put the seat up. - Yeah, put the seat up...

933
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,620
- ...對準馬桶尿 - 哦 天啊
- ...and just dip your butt in the bowl. - Oh, my God.

934
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,420
好了
There we go.

935
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,540
- 操 對不起 - 沒事
- Oh, shit, sorry. - It's okay.

936
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,540
- 抱歉 我小便後都要衝一衝 - 沒事
- Sorry, I always flush. - It's all right.

937
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,260
好了 我現在要洗手
Okay, I'm just gonna wash my hands.

938
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,260
不 你為什麼要洗手
No. Why are you gonna wash your hands?

939
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,700
- 為什麼 - 我哪次不洗手啦
- Why? - I always wash my hands.

940
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,020
- 你戴了手套的 - 被尿浸濕了
- You have gloves on. - Stuff gets under there.

941
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,740
好吧 別把動靜搞太大
Fine, just be quiet. Okay, okay.

942
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,860
就洗一下 不洗總感覺渾身不自在
Let me just wash them. I'll feel better.

943
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,140
哇靠 黛爾 住手
Oh, my God, Dale, stop.

944
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,180
我們是在偷窺 你好歹專業點
There's literally no element of sneak in anything you're doing.

945
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,180
- 沒那麼明顯吧 - 我也要尿一泡
- It's gross not to. - I gotta go now too.

946
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,460
- 你也要去? - 嗯
- You gotta go? - Yeah.

947
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,740
你灑手上沒有
Do you golf with the other hand...?

948
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,970
別吹口哨
Don't whistle.

949
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,580
沒辦法 只有這樣我才能尿出來
I have to. The only way to get this train going.

950
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,260
- 聽著 - 你幹嘛也衝
- Listen... - Why did you flush?

951
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,420
- 條件反射 - 為什麼
- It just happens. - Why?

952
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,900
- 這是個好習慣 - 扯淡
- It's a good habit. - Shit.

953
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,860
- 那是...? - 尼瑪 她過來了 躲起來
- What is...? - Shit. She's coming. Hide.

954
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,380
不過 曾經有一次 曾經有一次
But there was once, though. There was once...

955
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,420
大爺的 如果你們能保密的話
Oh, boy. If this is safe in here,

956
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,740
我倒想說出來和你們分享
I'd love to shake this out and share it.

957
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,940
情況有變 別掉下來打到我
Something must've happened. Don't fall on me.

958
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,900
別擔心 我在社區活動中心練過跑酷
Don't worry. I took a parkour class at the community center.

959
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,780
他把她弄回去了
Oh, he got her to go back.

960
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,540
- 我那時還是個孩子 - 多大
- I was a boy. - How old were you?

961
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,340
- 忘了 只記得很小 - 十四歲?
- I don't know. Young. - Fourteen?

962
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,500
差不多吧 兩個十四歲的男孩在露營的時候
I think we were. Two 14-year-old boys at camp...

963
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,460
不知道怎麼的
and not knowing what we're doing...

964
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,460
就絞在一起了
and just wrestling.

965
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,700
絞基露營 十四歲
Ooh. Wrestling camp. Fourteen.

966
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,300
相當精彩
Nice.

967
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,160
他說的是真的嗎
Is he telling the truth?

968
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,420
我不知道 不過如果是真的
I... I don't know. But, I mean, if he is...

969
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,260
-很適合他 對吧 - 必須的 眾望所歸
- Good for him, right? - Absolutely. That's great.

970
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,700
你們有沒有穿緊身熱辣連體衣
Did you guys wear those tight little onesies?

971
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,580
運動衫?
Singlets?

972
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,340
- 是這樣叫的嗎? - 對 運動衫
- Is that what they're called? - That's right. Singlets.

973
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,330
穿上緊身的彈性衣
Tight little spandex

974
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,860
龜頭的輪廓會更加清晰嗎?
offering a clear little outline of, say, a circumcised helmet?

975
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,740
- 我勒個擦 - 我有熱血沸騰嗎?
- Oh, boy. - Am I getting warm?

976
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,100
好了 也許該其他人分享了
Okay, maybe someone else should share.

977
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,340
- 不不不 我們再談談那東西 - 什麼意思
- No, no, no. Let's go to the unit. - Sorry?

978
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,410
那個地方看起來...?
What was the unit like on this little b...?

979
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,380
是青筋暴起的還是光滑的
Was it veiny? Smooth?

980
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,940
像小的高領毛衣還是食蟻獸
Little turtleneck? Anteater?

981
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,260
我 我也不清楚 很平常
I just... I don't know. Pretty normal.

982
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,740
初出茅廬的老二?
Starter penis?

983
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,500
我不想說得這麼直接 不過
Not the words I would've used, but...

984
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,580
團隊裡有個基佬也是很不錯的 對吧
It's good to have a gay friend in your group too, you know?

985
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,500
- 生命因此而精彩 - 沒錯
- It makes us more colorful. - Yeah.

986
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,530
那東西有沒有成功塞進你嘴裡
Now, did this penis ever, at any point,

987
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,660
哪怕是一部分
find its way into your mouth?

988
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,180
- 我的天 - 朱莉亞 別這樣
- Jesus. - Julia, no.

989
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,980
- 你不要再玩兒這套把戲了 - 什麼把戲
- You're not gonna pull this stunt again. - What stunt?

990
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,120
提前結束分享會
Stopping a meeting early

991
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,220
這樣她就可以想辦法找個基佬來一發
so she can try to flip another gay.

992
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,740
- 真的? - 得不到的總想要 說的就是她
- Really? - She always wants what she can't have.

993
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,900
聽著 沒激動 好吧? 他都不是基佬
Listen, relax, okay? He's not even gay.

994
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,720
十四歲的時候有一根雞巴擺在
He had one cock at 14

995
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,060
他面前他都沒有吹一管
and it hasn't made its way to his mouth yet.

996
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,690
你要是讓我說完
Well, if you'd let me finish...

997
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,380
這樣說來你吹了一管
So you did eat that cock.

998
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,940
你不就是想問我有沒有吹
You're asking if I sucked it?

999
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,780
我知道你吹了
I know you sucked it.

1000
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,420
我只是想聽你親口說
I just wanna hear you say it.

1001
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,060
- 布萊斯頓你沒必要說出來 - 閉嘴
- Blanston, you don't have to say it. - Shut your mouth.

1002
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,780
- 閉嘴 讓他說 你吹沒吹 - 快說吹了
- Shut up and let him share. You ate it? - Please say yes.

1003
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,580
你想知道我有沒有吹一管?
You wanna know if I ate that dick?

1004
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,580
你有沒有吹那管 就像炸彈直衝雲霄
Did you suck that cock like a Bomb Pop down to the blue?

1005
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,580
- 你想知道答案? - 給我說
- You want the answer? - Give it to me.

1006
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,580
我把他的老二和蛋蛋都塞進了嘴裡
I ate that dick, balls,

1007
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,660
還添了他濕潤的菊花
and licked that kid's sweaty asshole.

1008
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,870
這他媽就對了 你做了
Damn right you did

1009
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,540
因為你就是一個貨真價實的基佬
because you are awesomely gay.

1010
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,420
我是超級基佬 從來就沒有直過
I'm super gay. Never been straight.

1011
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,740
知道我還有什麼沒做過嗎
Know what else I've never been?

1012
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,580
- 操女人 - 休會
- Inside a woman. - Meeting adjourned.

1013
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,260
- 大家都出去 - 你妹的
- Everybody out. - Son of a bitch.

1014
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,940
快走 快點 快點 快出去
Come on. Hurry it up. Hurry it up. Come on.

1015
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,900
回見 拜拜 到此結束
See you later. Bye-bye. That's it.

1016
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,060
朱莉亞 你真的是上癮了
Okay, Julia, you are letting the addiction win.

1017
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,140
滾你媽的蛋 羅茲 反正沒人會上你
Oh, fuck you, Roz. No one likes you anyway.

1018
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,380
好吧
Okay.

1019
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,940
- 準備盡情的來一炮吧 - 來吧
- Let's get you prepped for a fill-n-drill. - Let's do it.

1020
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,440
有沒有在牙醫的椅子上做過
Ever done it in a dentist's chair?

1021
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,940
我早就想把我的牙醫脫得精光了
I always wanted to nail my dentist.

1022
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,940
- 他是個男的 - 我會讓你把他拋到九霄雲外
- He's a man. - I'll make you forget all about him.

1023
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,230
你為什麼不先去把椅子準備好呢
Why don't you go get the chair ready?

1024
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,140
我要去上個廁所 馬上就回來
I'm gonna visit the men's room real quick.

1025
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,620
你可以尿在我身上
Oh, you can do that on me.

1026
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,790
嗯 這個
Oh. Well, it's a...

1027
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,780
嗯?
And...?

1028
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,810
第一次和拉拉來一炮
Well, first time on the slopes,

1029
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,950
我可不想尿在美人身上
so I'm gonna stay off the black diamond.

1030
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,990
隨你便
Either way.

1031
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,810
你們動靜太大了 快走
You guys are so noisy. Let's go.

1032
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,340
對不起 對不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1033
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,660
恭喜 我為你出櫃感到驕傲
Congrats. I'm so proud of you for coming out.

1034
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,180
- 我不是同性戀 我一會兒就出來 行嗎 - 等等
- I'm not gay. I'll be right out, okay? - Come on.

1035
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,960
我覺得我現在走的話肯定會被懷疑
I think it'll be a little suspicious if I disappear.

1036
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,300
我給你們掩護到底
Gonna complete the diversion.

1037
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,100
- 我們必須走 - 你可是同性戀
- We gotta go. - Thought you were gay.

1038
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,420
我不是同性戀 快走 快走 我一會兒就出來
I'm not gay. Go on, go on. I'll be right out.

1039
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,980
我懂了 你男女通吃
Oh. I get it. You're bi.

1040
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,540
我不是
I'm not bi.

1041
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,980
不是?
Not bi?

1042
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,980
- 都有沒有一個S 我需要一個S - 有S
- Do you have, an S? I need an S. - S, yes.

1043
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,820
- 這個怎麼樣? - 能不能給我一個更嚇人的S
- How's that? - Do you have a scarier S than that?

1044
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,940
好的 嗯 這裡
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, here.

1045
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,500
這個是從一篇寫新娘酷斯拉的文章上剪下來的
This is from an article about bridezillas.

1046
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,060
好的 這個行 好吧 我可以把我拼的讀給你聽嗎
Yeah, that'll do it. Okay, can I read you what I got right now?

1047
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,300
- 當然可以 - 好的
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Okay.

1048
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,300
給我們五十萬
"Give us the $500,000..

1049
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,980
不然就殺了這個小孩男兒
...or the little boy dies.

1050
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,740
你只剩二十四小時的時間
You have 24 hours."

1051
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,820
要是你讀給他聽就好了 這聲音聽起來很嚇人
I wish you were there to read it. Sounds scary in that voice.

1052
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,580
這就是我要把信弄得恐怖一點的原因
That's why I wanted scary letters.

1053
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,300
這樣他在讀信的時候就像是親耳聽到這聲音一樣
Hopefully he's hearing a voice like that when he reads.

1054
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,110
但是 為什麼用"小男孩"兒這個詞
But why "little boy"?

1055
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,110
聽起來像是六歲小孩
Makes him sound 6.

1056
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,660
那換成"不然就殺了這個成年淫"
Don't wanna be like, "Or the grown man dies."

1057
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,180
- 不錯 可以 - 還是有點
- You're right. No, absolutely. - It's not even...

1058
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,680
行 給我固體膠 我要把它們黏上
All right, glue stick, and I'm gonna lock this in.

1059
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,540
嗯 好的
Oh, great, yeah.

1060
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,460
- 把初稿當最終稿 好不好 - 覺得怎麼樣 幹得不錯
- First draft, final draft, right? - How about that? Nice job.

1061
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,060
我給你說
God, I tell you what.

1062
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,810
不是我自吹自擂
I hope this doesn't sound cocky.

1063
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,500
我覺得我們真的是幹這個的料
I think we're really good at this.

1064
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,900
絕對地天賦異稟
We're extremely good at it.

1065
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,860
我什麼都不說了 這方法比謀殺好多了
I didn't wanna say anything, but way better than murder.

1066
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,180
- 比謀殺好得太多了 - 我覺得我們開竅了
- A lot better than murder. - We found our groove.

1067
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,580
- 這很搞笑 - 的確有點搞笑
- This is fun. - It is kind of fun.

1068
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,950
沒有人會受傷害
Nobody gets hurt.

1069
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,300
我早就想弄一封勒索信了
I always wanted to make a ransom note.

1070
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,340
人都齊了 走吧
All here. Let's go.

1071
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,700
你大爺的 早知道我剛才就把這些都黏貼好了
Son of a bitch. I knew I should've been gluing them as I went along.

1072
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,980
嘿 給我說說 感覺怎麼樣
Hey. Hey. Talk to me. How was it?

1073
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,460
這種感覺前所未有
It was like something I've just never encountered.

1074
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,660
未有什麼 女人?
What, a woman?

1075
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,260
我是說她很奔放 而且身體功夫了得
I mean, she's so free. She's so eloquent with her body.

1076
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,060
我意思是所有的性能量
I mean, all of that sexual energy...

1077
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,980
從她溫柔的胴體的深處流出來
it flows from this place of deep tenderness, you know?

1078
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,060
- 那叫陰道 - 別這樣用詞 行了 走吧
- It's called her vagina, Nick. - Please don't talk like that. Come on, let's go.

1079
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,740
你看你現在還護著她
Listen. He's being so protective.

1080
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,020
聽你這語氣你好像愛上她了
You're talking like you fell in love with her.

1081
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,860
你愛上她了嗎 尼克
What, are you in love with her, Nick?

1082
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,100
沒有 黛爾
No, Dale.

1083
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,540
- 你這反應也太慢了吧 - 他是在沉默
- That was a real long pause right there. - That was a moment of silence.

1084
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,420
我沒愛上她 這太扯淡了
I'm not in love with her. That's ridiculous.

1085
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,900
她給了我一次豐富多彩積極向上的體驗
She gave me a very rich and positive experience.

1086
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,260
是嗎 比絞基露營好多了
Oh, yeah? Better than wrestling camp?

1087
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,020
老天 這房子高大上
Oh, boy. Nice house.

1088
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,540
他終於清醒了
Well, he's doing well.

1089
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,820
算他好運
Good for him.

1090
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,580
- 好吧 我們來討論一下行動方案 - 深呼吸 直接上
- All right, let's discuss our options. - Breathe, and go.

1091
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,500
嘿 等等
Hey, whoa.

1092
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,620
你們倆二逼不能把車停在別人房子的正前方
Guys, you can't just park right in front of the guy's house.

1093
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,220
你想把一個意識模糊的富家公子在街上拖著走?
You wanna carry an unconscious dude down the street?

1094
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,220
他沉得要死 快行動
He's gonna be way too heavy. Let's move.

1095
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,990
說得對 說到點子上了
That's a good point. Good point.

1096
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,020
等等 你們不能直接從他的正門進入
Wait, whoa. You can't just walk up to the guy's front door.

1097
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,170
你能停下嗎
Will you calm down? We have a plan.

1098
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,180
我們計劃好了的 我們計劃好了的放鬆
We have a plan. Just relax.

1099
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,100
真的? 那樣最好 我感覺好多了
Oh, do you? That's great. That makes me feel a lot better.

1100
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,420
- 你準備好了嗎? - 我準備好了
- Okay, you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready.

1101
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,380
看好了 行動
Watch this. Go.

1102
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,180
- 我靠 - 我靠
- Fuck. - Fuck.

1103
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,950
- 計劃失敗 - 門鎖上了
- It's a bust. - It's locked.

1104
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,440
這個計劃沒有考慮門被鎖上的情況?
The plan did not account for a locked door?

1105
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,310
鎖上與打開的機率各占百分之五十
Fifty-fifty chance it's gonna be open.

1106
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,500
- 你們怎麼算出來的? - 只有鎖上和未鎖兩種情況
- How do you figure that? - Either locked or unlocked.

1107
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,560
五十比五十
Fifty-fifty, yeah.

1108
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,740
這是基本的數學問題 你今晚怎麼了
It's basic math. What's up with you tonight?

1109
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,580
- 把你的信用卡給我 - 好想法
- Give me your credit card. - Good.

1110
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,740
- B計劃是插信用卡進去? - 快給我
- Plan B's got a credit card in it? - Come on.

1111
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,540
- 你的計劃就是渣 - 你的數學才是渣
- Your plan sucks. - Your math sucks.

1112
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,780
這就是事實
That's what's going on.

1113
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,980
- 等等 要是他在裡面怎麼辦啊 - 對啊
- Wait. What if he's in there? - Oh, yeah.

1114
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,620
- 我們怎麼才能確定 - 為什麼不按門鈴
- How do we make sure? - Why don't you ring the doorbell?

1115
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,420
- 我喜歡聰明人的想法 - 別 庫爾特
- I love it. Smart. - Don't. Kurt.

1116
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,620
尼瑪 你在耍我吧
Oh, shit. Are you kidding?

1117
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,740
- 這麼晚了沒人在裡面的 - 別再按了
- It's dark. Don't think anybody's here. - Don't hit it again.

1118
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,620
- 你聽見沒 - 我知道那首歌
- You hear that? - I know that song.

1119
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,620
- 那是什麼 - 這是一首歌對吧 難道是
- What is that? - It's a song, right? Is it:

1120
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,380
不管你做了什麼
No matter what you do

1121
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,740
別 別
No, no.

1122
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,100
我都會永遠和你在一起
I will always be with you

1123
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,620
- 這歌誰唱的 - 壞手指樂隊
- Who sings that? - Badfinger.

1124
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,300
無論你做了什麼 姑娘
Doesn't matter what you do, girl

1125
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,580
小聲點
Quiet.

1126
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,900
噢 姑娘 和你在一起
Ooh, girl, with you

1127
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,260
你們唱對了
You nailed it.

1128
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,620
推倒了那陳舊的灰牆
Knock down the old gray wall

1129
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,060
他媽的給我閉嘴
Shut the fuck up.

1130
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,180
- 嘿 你在大吼大叫 - 你在大吼大叫
- Hey, you're yelling. - You're yelling.

1131
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,780
幫幫我 趕緊的
Do me a favor. Hurry up.

1132
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,080
沒能打開前門
Fail to open up the front door

1133
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,500
所以我們他媽的都趕快離開這裡
so we can get the fuck out of here.

1134
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,660
臥槽
Fuck.

1135
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,260
- 你操什麼 什麼情況 - 我們有麻煩了
- What's "fuck"? What happened? - We got a problem.

1136
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,500
- 沒錯 你看吧 那裡 - 你大爺的
- Yeah, see? Right there? - Goddamn it.

1137
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,020
- 就在那裡憂鬱地望著我們 - 那現在怎麼辦
- There it is. Staring back at us. - Okay, what now?

1138
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,620
我覺得我們應該聽你的離開這裡
I guess we follow your idea and we get out of here.

1139
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,340
- 沒錯 我們必須離開 - 不 嘿 我信用卡還在那裡
- Yeah, we gotta go. - No. Hey. My credit card's in there.

1140
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,650
打電話掛失
Call them and cancel.

1141
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,780
他們今晚就會送張新的給你
They'll send you a new one overnight.

1142
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,460
要是他們發現了這張卡 他們就會知道我們來過這裡
When they find the card, they'll know we were here.

1143
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,220
道理就這麼簡單
It's pretty simple.

1144
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,540
- 真他媽見鬼 - 他們會知道你來過這裡的
- Oh, shit. - They're gonna know you were here.

1145
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,060
快跑 快跑 車 有車
Go, go. Car. Car.

1146
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,900
- 你來這裡都做了什麼 - 手指擋住
- What do you got going there? - Finger-flage.

1147
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,660
那是他老婆嗎
Is that his wife?

1148
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,340
不 那是輛93年的本田思域 她提的是乾洗的衣服
No, that's a '93 Civic and she's carrying dry cleaning.

1149
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,660
我猜她是個傭人
I'm gonna go with a maid.

1150
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,260
他和他的女傭結婚了?
He married his maid?

1151

I can't believe she's fucking doing that.

1205
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,540
她插得還不夠深
She's not going in deep enough.

1206
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,500
- 你覺得她是在洗菊花嗎? - 顯然是個新手

1217
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,860
我們現在在做什麼
 What are we doing? What do we do now?

1218
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,970
等他上床睡覺 黛爾打開氣瓶
We wait for him to go to bed. Dale starts the gas.

1219
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,980
我把勒索信準備好
I've got the ransom note.

1220
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,020
- 不是現在 - 他說了 黛爾打開氣瓶
- Not now. - He said, "Dale, start the gas."

1221
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,340
我是說了 黛爾打開氣瓶
I said, "Dale starts the gas."

1222
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,090
後面在打開 二貨 關掉
Later, you idiot. Turn that off.

1223
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,340
不能把氣體放在這裡
We can't have the gas in here.

1224
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,820
我會把這信放在
Okay. I'll put this on the...

1225
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,580
- 關掉 - 我在關 這壞了還是怎麼了
- Turn it off. - I'm trying to. It's broken or something.

1226
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,780
你開玩笑吧 把它扳到另一邊
Are you kidding me? Turn it the other way.

1227
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,020
我關了一百萬次
We dropped it like a million times.

1228
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,180
我覺得我們把它弄壞了 看見了嗎
I think we broke it. No, see?

1229
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,220
- 一點都不起作用了 - 我們快出去
- It's not doing anything. - Let's get out.

1230
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,100

別笑了 這有什麼好笑的?
Don't start laughing. What is funny about this?

1235
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,460
看看你的臉 快看看他的臉

- 不好 - 老兄 你的臉...

1240
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,220
是的 就是因為笑氣
Yes, it's the gas.

1241
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,820
- 這感覺真好 - 你才要振作呢
- It's pretty good. - You keep it together.

1242
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,300
我想打的是他
I was trying to hit him.

1243
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,980
- 你們兩個 - 他要倒了
- Guys. - No, no, no.

1244
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,830
好了 我沒事 我沒事 我們應該...
Okay. I'm good. I'm good. Let's...

1245

1249
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,740
我的天啊 我昨天晚上沒回家 她大概嚇壞了
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's probably freaking out. I didn't come home last night.

1250
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,940
安靜一點
Quiet.

1251
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,420
老兄 把你的頭從我的褲襠移開
Dude, get your fucking head out of my crotch.

1252
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,420
你們看看這白天的景致!
Will you look at this fucking view during the daytime?

1253
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,860
這一定是在開玩笑!
You kidding me?

1254
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,420
- 他好像走了 - 難以置信
- He seems gone. - Unbelievable.

1255
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,420
-床已經鋪好了 - 我完全無法相信這一切
- Bed's made. - I can't believe this.

1256
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,860
我們應該確認一下他...
We should maybe just check...

1257
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,220
- 雷克斯! - 嘿
- Hey! Rex! - Hey.

1258
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,820
雷克斯! 雷克斯!

1259
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,740
黛爾
Dale.

1260
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,580
要是他還在家怎麼辦?
Did you have a plan if he responded?

1261
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,280
我沒想那麼長遠
I didn't think that far ahead.

1262
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,480
要是我的話就不會回應
I would've just been quiet.

1263
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,040
就是啊
Yeah.

1264
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,060
我發現早上的你更笨
You get even dumber in the mornings.

1265
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,700
- 你在擔心什麼? -  我們快走吧
- What are you worried about? - Let's go.

1266
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,470
- 他有一半的機率在家 - 對啊
- Fifty-fifty chance, you know, fifty-fifty chance he was here. - Yeah.

1267
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,020
我回去之後史黛西肯定氣翻了
You know, Stacy's just gonna completely flip out when I get home.

1268
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,930
她肯定會說: "什麼樣的爸爸是不回家的? "
What kind of dad doesn't come home?

1269
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,740
你給我閉嘴 求你了
Shut that down. Okay?

1270
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,570
如果現在最壞的結果
If the worst thing that happens

1271
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,700
只是你的家庭問題...
from this clusterfuck is your domestic problems...

1272
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,380
那我們還算走運的 我們剛剛逃過一劫
we can consider ourselves lucky. We just dodged a huge bullet back there.

1273
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,060
我們差點做了一個一生中最傻的決定
We almost made the worst decision of our lives.

1274
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,650
那倒是真的 你知道為什麼嗎?
That's true. You know why?

1275
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,430
如果他打開了衣櫥然後看到了我們
Cause if he opens that closet door and sees us,

1276
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,540
我們現在就在監獄裡了
we're in prison right now.

1277
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,320
是是是 所以我們非常 非常地幸運
That's right. So we're very, very lucky.

1278
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,060
我們之前是不是腦抽了?
What the fuck is the matter with us?

1279
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,900
我告訴你們
You know what? I tell you what.

1280
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,140
要是有一點點事情是按我們計劃發展的 我們肯定就成功了
If a couple tiny things went our way, we could've pulled that off.

1281
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,370
不 我們不是罪犯 我們一點都不會犯罪
No. We're not criminals. We suck at crime.

1282
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,500
我們都是善良的正常人
We're like nice, normal guys.

1283
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,260
- 我喜歡棒球 我每天都穿褲子 - 是
- I like baseball. I wear pants. - Yup.

1284
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,940
- 我們又得回去替人打工 - 辛勤工作啊 兄弟
- Back to being cogs in the machine. - Cogs. Cogs, dude.

1285
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,260
辛勤工作也沒什麼不好
Cogs are good.

1286
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,900
我反倒覺得輕鬆一些了
It's a relief, you know?

1287
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,650
就像很重的東西...
It's like a weight lifted off your...

1288
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,060
是啊 從肩上卸下來
That's right, my shoulder.

1289
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,850
我們要重新開始...
It's a fresh start where everything's...

1290
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,420
我過會打電話給你們
I'll call you guys later.

1291
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,660
- 求你們別殺我 - 我去!
- Please don't kill me. - Fuck!

1292
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,620
- 哇靠 - 這是怎麼回事?
- Oh, fuck. - What the fuck is that?

1293
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,860
怎麼會這樣? 我們都做了什麼?
What the fuck is that? What did we do?

1294
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,140
難道我們吸足了笑氣還能把他綁架了?
We kidnapped him while we're high on nitrous?

1295
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,540
然後還能自己回到衣櫥裡睡覺?
Then what? We just went back into the closet and went to sleep?

1296
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,460
- 我們為什麼要這麼做? - 噓 噓 - 怎麼了?
- Why would we do that? - Shh... shh... shh - What?

1297
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,500
他是在哭嗎?
Is he crying?

1298
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,820
噢 我的天啊 太好笑了
Oh, my God. The best.

1299
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,300
真是太好笑了
That was so good.

1300
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,980
快把我拉出來
Help me out.

1301
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,620
你們的表情... 看看你們的表情
The look on your... Look at this.

1302
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,300
我實在忍不住了... 你們嚇傻了吧
I really couldn't... Your fucking face.

1303
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,380
- 我的天 - 嗨
- Oh, my God. - Hey, man. Yeah. Whoo-whee.

1304
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,140
你真騙到我們了
You had us.

1305
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,940
- 發生了什麼? - 我也不知道
- What's happening? - I don't know.

1306
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,260
- 到底怎麼回事? - 噢天啊
- What's happening? - Oh, boy.

1307
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,860
天啊 謝謝你們
Oh, my God, you guys. Thank you.

1308
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,300
我很長時間沒笑得這麼開心了
I have not laughed like that in a long time.

1309
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,060
真是太好笑了 這個笑話簡直是精神食糧
Oh, my God. Goddamn, that was great. Food for the soul.

1310
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,260
不錯 我們就是為了搞笑的
Good, well, we were just trying to be funny.

1311
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,940
- 沒有傷害 就不算犯規 對吧 - 是啊是啊
- You know, no harm, no foul, right? - Yeah, yeah.

1312
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,900
我真的完全低估你們了
Guys, I completely underestimated you.

1313
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,740
你們還真有些本事 你們還真是令人印象深刻
You fuckers have some low-hanging balls. I mean it. I'm impressed.

1314
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,700
我起床之後就發現你們在我的衣櫥裡...
I mean, I wake up, I find you three in my closet...

1315
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,540
還有一張勒索信和一個裝笑氣的破罐子
along with a ransom note, a big old bottle of nitrous.

1316
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,180
我就在想 "媽蛋 這幾個混蛋是想要給我聞笑氣迷昏我"
I'm like, "Holy shit. These fuckers were gonna gas me."

1317
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,940
我差點就報警了 不過我又想 "等一下
I'm about to call the cops when I think, "Hold up a sec.

1318
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,100
這幾個人可能有什麼陰謀"
These guys may be onto something."

1319
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,220
我想加入你們
I wanna partner up on this thing.

1320
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,580
什麼陰謀? 你在講些什麼?
What thing? What are you talking about?

1321
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,580
我聽不太懂
I'm not sure what you mean.

1322
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,100
- 就是這個陰謀啊 綁架我啊 - 這
- This thing. My kidnapping. - Oh.

1323
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,260
說實話 我和我爸...
Truth be told, Pop and I...

1324
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,700
我們之間出現了一些問題
we've hit a rough patch.

1325
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,980
他不替我付帳了
 He's refusing to cover some of my expenses.

1326
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,110
說來話長 總之 你們選的時間點不能再合適了
Long story. Anyway, your timing could not have been better.

1327
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,220
這是一條槍魚嗎?
Is this a fucking marlin?

1328
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,740
雷克斯 你的提議不錯 不過我們已經決定收手不幹了
Rex, this is, cool and all, but we decided, like, we're out.

1329
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,700
- 我們不會犯罪的 - 這不是我們該幹的
- We're not doing crime. - Not our thing.

1330
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,820
他說的對 其實我們不打算綁架你了
Yeah, no, he's right. No, the kidnapping is off, actually.

1331
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,180
- 不 不 你們還得繼續下去 - 不 我們不幹了
- No, no, no, it's on. - No, it's off.

1332
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,820
不是的 你們必須得繼續"綁架"我 我已經把勒索信寄給我爸了
No, it's totally on. I sent the ransom note to my dad.

1333
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,340
- 你什麼? - 你做了什麼?
- You what? - You did what?

1334
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,720
勒索信寫得太好了
And it was brilliant.

1335
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,860
誰想出要把我寫成一個小男孩的?
Who came up with that thing about me being a little boy?

1336
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,180
- 幹得漂亮 - 謝謝
- Beautiful. - Thanks.

1337
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,040
你只要了50萬美元 我還覺得少了呢
I was a little insulted you only asked for $500,000 for me.

1338
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,100
我就值那麼些錢?
Is that all I'm worth?

1339
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,060
不過也不是很麻煩 我又添了一個零上去
No sweat. I tacked on another zero.

1340
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,390
- 五百百萬? - 天 太多了
- Five-hundred million? - Wow, that's a ton.

1341
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,340
- 是五百萬 - 五百萬
- Five million, guys. - Five million.

1342
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,020
- 五百萬啊 - 對
- Five million. - Five. Right.

1343
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,340
是的 五百萬 分你們一百萬 分我四百萬
Yeah, 5 million. One million dollars for you guys, and 4 for me.

1344
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,140
我們不如去搞一個付費電話來打勒索電話?
Why don't we get a payphone to make that ransom call?

1345
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,980
呃 雷克斯 還是算了吧
Yeah, Rex, let's not.

1346
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,130
我們感謝你慷慨的提議
We appreciate the generous offer,

1347
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,300
也很感謝你沒有報警 不過還是算了吧
and thank you very much for not calling the cops, but we're gonna pass.

1348
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,500
- 別這樣 - 就是這樣
- No. - Yeah.

1349
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,420
伙伴們 這難道不是個天大的好消息嗎?
Guys. Guys, how is this anything but great news?

1350
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,610
你們只要完成計劃
All I'm asking you to do is finish your own plan

1351
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,700
就能拿到雙倍的錢了
 but for double the money.

1352
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,100
而且我是你們的內線
Plus, it got a thousand times easier

1353
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,060
所以完成這個計劃比原來容易多了
because now I'm your inside man.

1354
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,700
我可以確保我爸付贖金
I can make sure Dad pays up.

1355
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,540
然後等你們"放了我"之後
And then when you, "set me free"...

1356
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,660
我就告訴警察是另外三個白痴綁架了我
I tell the cops it was three other morons that went that way.

1357
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,300
哇塞 這倒不是個壞主意
Oh. Wow. That's not the worst idea I've ever heard.

1358
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,820
-這比我們原來的計劃好 - 好多了
- It's better than our original idea. - A lot better.

1359
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,460
等我們一下
Give us one second.

1360
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,700
你們在想點什麼?
Fucking what?

1361
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,380
- 我們根本不能相信他 - 你當然可以相信我了
- We can't trust this guy. - You can trust me.

1362
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,020
你說得對 他們已經騙過我們一次了
No, you're right. They burned us once already.

1363
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,220
我們不能再被騙了
We're not gonna get burned again.

1364
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,580
- 得了吧 - 謝謝你 不過還是算了
- Nice try. - Thanks but no thanks.

1365
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,860
- 我們三個都不同意 - 都不同意
- That's a Nick-Kurt-Dale no from us. - Nick, Kurt and Dale.

1366
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,980
- 所以 謝了 不過再見了 - 嗯
- So, thank you, but adios. - Yeah.

1367
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,700
- 好吧 - 你要我們送你回去嗎?
- Okay. - You need a ride?

1368
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,980
不用了 那我還是在這裡多待一會
No. I think I'll hang out here.

1369
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,580
逃出你們的魔掌...
You know, escape from your clutches...

1370
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,380
然後報警
and call the police.

1371
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,740
那你報警呀 我們又沒有綁架過你
Go ahead. Call them. We never kidnapped you.

1372
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,380
- 不 你們綁架了 - 我們才沒有
- Yeah, you did. - We didn't.

1373
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,340
- 你們的確把我拐走了 - 明明就沒有
- Yeah, you abducted me. - We did not.

1374
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,180
可你們把我帶來這裡啦
Yeah, you brought me back here.

1375
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,260
- 我們打鬥了一番 - 真是糟糕 你可不能這樣
- There was a struggle. - Oh, shit. Come on, man.

1376
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,110
有東西被打破了
Things got broken.

1377
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,740
怎麼會... ?
What the...?

1378
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,420
然後 你們就打了我
And then, you assaulted me.

1379
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,100
- 天啊 - 什麼?
- Oh, shit. - What?

1380
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,700
這人一定是瘋了
This guy's fucking nuts.

1381
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,620
雷克斯 計劃早就結束了
Hey, Rex? It's off, pal.

1382
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,220
然後你們又無情地揍了我一頓
Oh, and then you beat me. Mercilessly.

1383
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,940
天啊 他在自己打自己
Holy shit. He's Fight Clubbing himself. We got a Fight Clubber.

1384
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,060
之後我就到這裡來 找到了這個電話
And then I found my way up here and I found this phone.

1385
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,580
- 我就撿起聽筒... - 不
- I picked up the receiver... - Oh, no.

1386
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,100
... 然後我就撥了九...
...and I dialed 9...

1387
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,460
- 別別別 - 拜託 玩笑已經開過了
- Don't, don't, don't. - Come on. Joke's over.

1388
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,620
- ... 一... - 你不能再按一了
- ...1... - Don't you hit the second 1.

1389
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,150
- 快停下 - 別按了
- Don't do it. - Don't hit it.

1390
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,910
我不知道要去哪裡
I don't know where I'm going.

1391
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,980
我也不知道在哪裡能找到付費電話
I don't know where you find pay phones.

1392
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,420
- 這個公園裡有付費電話 - 好吧
- There's some pay phones at the park here. - Okay.

1393
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,670
我們要幹這一票了 冒險已經開始了 你們是不是都很激動啊?
Boys, we are doing this. The adventure begins. Who's fired up?

1394
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,220
你們都太消極了 搞得我很不好受 拜託了
Such a negative energy. This is killing me. Guys, come on.

1395
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,220
- 你能不能移過去一點? - 不行 我就是坐在中間的
- Can you scoot over just a smidge? - No, I sit in the middle.

1396
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,380
- 那是他的座位 - 一直是這樣的 雷克斯
- That's his seat. - It's a whole thing, Rex.

1397
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,140
我知道 只是你擠著我了
I know. Just you're crowding me.

1398
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,340
我怎麼擠著他了?
I'm crowding this guy now?

1399
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,500
他逼著我們綁架他 我還擠到他了? 這太荒謬了
He's forcing us to kidnap him, and I'm crowding him?

1400
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,720
哇 哇 哇 兄弟 冷靜一下
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. Simmer down.

1401
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,700
綁架是你想出來的 記得不?
Kidnapping was your idea, remember?

1402
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,420
- 但之後我們放棄了 - 對啊 就是這樣
- But then we had the idea to not do it. - Yeah, exactly.

1403
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,300
- 我就是坐在中間的! - 嘿 嘿
- I sit in the middle! - Hey, hey.

1404
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,020
- 黛爾 你就按他說的做吧 - 我的天啊
- Dale, just do what he says. - For chrissake.

1405
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,790
啊 這樣不錯
Oh, God. That is nice.

1406
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,860
舒服多了
This is way better.

1407
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,060
這就是在胡扯
This is bullshit, by the way.

1408
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,410
不好意思 哈里斯醫生
Excuse me, Dr. Harris.

1409
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,580
昨天晚上有人在辦公室嗎?
 Was someone in the office last night?

1410
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,620
昨天晚上八點我的性癮交流協會在這裡聚會
My sex-addiction group met here at 8.

1411
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,700
對的 不過電腦記錄到之前有人進來過
Oh. Yes. But, doctor, the keypad logged an earlier entrance.

1412
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,230
真的嗎?
Really?

1413
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,380
那我們看一下新裝的監控
Let's check our fancy new camera system.

1414
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,470
那是個同性戀 真是奇怪
That's a gay guy. It's so weird.

1415
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,740
他看起來不太像同性戀
He didn't bone me like a gay guy.

1416
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,540
他就是流了點眼淚
He only cried, like, a little bit.

1417
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,980
而且他對於他的肛門很拘謹 這很奇怪
And he was oddly squeamish about his own asshole, which is weird.

1418
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,910
- 這太奇怪了 - 我也是這麼想的
- It's so weird. - Yeah, that's what I thought.

1419
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,580
那是黛爾嗎?
Is that Dale?

1420
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,380
他和庫爾特和布萊斯頓在一塊兒幹什麼?
What's he doing with Kurt and Blanston?

1421
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,380
- 我們要報警嗎? -  不用了
- Should we call the police? - No.

1422
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,940
還是不了
No.

1423
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,950
我來解決他們
I'll take care of them.

1424
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,350
好好享受吧
Enjoy.

1425
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,550
這還是蠻不錯的 學著點
It's good stuff. Learn something.

1426
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,420
好了 已經撥出去了
All right, it's ringing.

1427
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,690
記住 籌碼都在你們這裡
Remember, you guys hold all the cards.

1428
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,060
嚴肅一些 你們會做的很好的
Game faces. You are going to crush this.

1429
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,180
等一下 他知道我們的聲音 我們應該裝出一些口音
Hold on. He knows what we sound like. We gotta use an accent.

1430
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,380
- 不要裝口音 那太奇葩了 - 好主意 庫爾特
- No accents. That's ridiculous. - That's a great idea, Kurty.

1431
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,900
比爾德·斯特姆公司
Boulder Stream.

1432
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,300
- 那是誰? 是秘書嗎? - 裝出口音來
- Who is this? The secretary? - Accent. Yeah.

1433
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,780
親愛的 讓我和伯特·漢森先生通電話
Hey, homey. Let me speak to Mr. Bert Hanson.

1434
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,640
不 我不介意等一會
No, I don't mind holding.

1435
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,540
我費了好大勁才打通你的電話
I just barely even called you right now already.

1436
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,740
- 這太種族歧視了 - 太種族歧視了
- That's incredibly racist. - Super racist.

1437
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,100
還是用一個南方口音吧
Just do a Southern accent.

1438
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,620
南方? 我會南方口音 沒問題
Southern? Southern I got. Southern. No problem.

1439
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,260
漢森
Hanson.

1440
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,580
你好啊 伙伴
Well, howdy there, partner.

1441
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,700
你家公子現在在我們手上
This here's the gents what got your young'un and all.

1442
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,460
我們需要談一談
And, well, we got some talking to do and...

1443
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,480
我讓你裝南方口音 而不是老礦工的口音
Southern, not old prospector.

1444
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,500
我覺得剛剛那還不錯
I thought that was pretty good.

1445
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,500
聽著 你們這些卑賤的老工人
Listen, you lowlife bottom-feeder,

1446
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,380
我沒時間和你們瞎鬧
I don't have time for this little fuck-around.

1447
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,020
要麼你現在掛掉電話
Either this ends right now,

1448
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,740
要麼我就給你吃子彈
or it ends with bullets in your skulls.

1449
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,300
不 你閉嘴 你一點都嚇不倒我們 你兒子在我們這裡
Now, you hush. You don't scare us one bit. We got your boy.

1450
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,260
這肯定把你嚇壞了
I bet that tears you up something fierce.

1451
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,980
我怎麼知道我兒子真在你那裡?
How do I know you really have my boy?

1452
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,660
爸
Dad.

1453
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,980
爸 是不是你 求求你快來救我 他們太變態了
Dad, is that you? Please. They're crazy.

1454
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,500
他們跟我說 要是你報警的話就殺了我
They told me if you call the police, they'd kill me.

1455
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,620
求求你按他們說的做 爸 我不想死
Please. Please, do whatever they say. I don't wanna die, Dad.

1456
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,580
別報警
No police.

1457
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,020
- 我的天 - 雷克斯? 雷克斯? 你在哪裡?
- God! - Rex? Rex? Where are you?

1458
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,980
你給我聽好了 你必須把
Now, you listen. Y'all gonna have to rassle up...

1459
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,060
五百萬現金交給我們
that 5 million bucks in cash.

1460
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,780
全都是100塊的紙幣
We're looking at all 100s.

1461
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,980
- 不許做記號 - 不許做記號
- Unmarked. - Unmarked.

1462
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,980
- 不能有跟蹤器 – 不許帶跟蹤器 也不許在錢上面做標記
- No tracers. - No tracers and no dye packs neither.

1463
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,660
不然的話 我們就...
Otherwise, we gonna take your boy...

1464
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,300
用我們有的
and string him up by his pretty little neck...

1465
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,940
最粗的繩子
with the roughest, coarsest piece of rope we got...

1466
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,420
綁在他纖細的小脖子上
in our rope inventory.

1467
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,540
聽明白了? 二十四小時之內不交錢我們就撕票
You understand? You got 24 hours before he dead.

1468
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,300
- 太棒了 - 我們做到了
- Yes. - That is how it's done.

1469
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,580
我們走吧
Let's go. All right.

1470
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,540
剛剛簡直太棒了
Guys, that was great.

1471
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,180
真是有意思
That was so much fun.

1472
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,020
- 絕對的 - 你們太厲害了
- Absolutely. - You were incredible.

1473
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,820
- 謝謝你替我們買了零食 - 應該的
- Thanks for getting us snacks, dude. - You earned it.

1474
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,300
所以現在我們做些什麼?
So now what? What do we do?

1475
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,540
- 好的 - 接下來的計劃是什麼?
- Okay. - What's the plan?

1476
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,900
我們不如回辦公室吧
I say we go back to the office.

1477
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,620
好嗎? 先低調一些
Okay? Lay low for a little while.

1478
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,740
- 然後我們就等著拿錢了
And we wait for that money train to roll in.

1479
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,050
把音響開響點 我喜歡這首歌
Oh! Turn up this song. I love this one.

1480
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,300
我們就要完成綁架計劃了
We're doing this thing.

1481
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,010
我不喜歡打破你們歡樂的心情
I hate to break up the car party,

1482
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,540
不過 雷克斯 你根本就沒有想好交換贖金的計劃
but, Rex, you don't have a plan for the ransom drop...

1483
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,540
綁架犯最容易在那時候被抓住
and that is the part where people get caught.

1484
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,180
沒有警察 交贖金就很容易了
Wow. The ransom drop is only hard if the police are involved.

1485
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,340
是啊 可是萬一他報警了怎麼辦?
Yeah. But what if he does call the police?

1486
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,300
那就不妙了
Because that wouldn't be good.

1487
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,300
他是億萬富翁 他不會為了五百萬就不管我死活了
He's a billionaire. He's not gonna risk my life over $5 million.

1488
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,560
有了庫爾特的精彩表演
After Kurt's little performance,

1489
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,940
他不可能報警的
there's no way he's gonna call the cops.

1490
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,900
我的表演很精彩? 那你呢? 你演得太好了
My performance? What about yours? You were so in the moment.

1491
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,140
- 你真這麼覺得? - 你演得很好! 另外你也…
- You think so? - You were great! And you were…

1492
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,500
你們都閉嘴吧
Get your mouths off his dick, okay?

1493
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,060
- 每個人都演得很好 – 冷靜一下
- Everyone was doing pretty good. - Whoa. Take it down a notch.

1494
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,260
等一下 都別說話 史黛西打電話來了
Wait. Shut up, shut up, shut up. This is Stacy.

1495
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,580
噢 我的天啊 我忘記打給她了 嗨 親愛的
Oh, my God. I forgot to call her. Hi, honey.

1496
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,500
- 你昨天晚上去哪了? - 是這樣的
- Where have you been all night? - Here's what happened.

1497
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,460
我在公司睡著了 然後...
I fell asleep at the office, and...

1498
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,660
真的嗎? 我的手機定位軟體說你並不在公司
Really? Because Find My iPhone said you weren't at the office.

1499
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,740
黛爾你是不是有小三了?
What, are you cheating on me, Dale?

1500
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,580
- 聽著 你現在心情不好... - 糟糕
- Look, you're upset and... - Oh, shit.

1501
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,580
- 該死的 - 他報警了
- Oh, God. Goddamn it. - He called the cops.

1502
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,740
- 我們被抓現行了 - 被抓? 我的天啊
- Oh, we're busted. - Busted? Oh, my God.

1503
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,420
- 不是我被捕 - 快開車
- I'm not busted. - Drive.

1504
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,860
沒有人被捕
No one is busted in a bad sense of the word.

1505
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,920
太晚了 盧佩已經看到我們了 開過去
Too late. Lupe's got us. Pull in.

1506
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,100
把你的頭放到我大腿上
Put your head in my lap.

1507
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,090
親愛的 沒有人的頭在我的大腿上
Honey, no one's head's going in my lap.

1508
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,340
這只是一句流行語罷了 我不能和你多講了
It's something guys are saying now. I can't talk.

1509
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,220
- 躲起來 躲起來 - 我完蛋了
- Hide, hide, hide. - I am fucked.

1510
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,540
- 我們走進去就行了 冷靜一點 - 靠
- Let's just go in. Be calm and be cool. - Shit.

1511
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,660
- 嗨 - 你們好
- Hi. - Gentlemen.

1512
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,060
- 這房子是你們的嗎? - 這個地方?
- You own this establishment? - This place here?

1513
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,900
我不知道 我這輩子就沒什麼東西是我自己的
I don't know. Do you really own anything in this lifetime?

1514
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,100
我們只是租的
We're currently renting.

1515
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,300
我們就租了這些東西 電啊 質子啊
It's all just material. Electrons, protons.

1516
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,830
- 對的 - 嚴格來說
- Yeah. We do. - Technically.

1517
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,820
我要問你們一下 你們的公司最近和伯特·漢森有商業往來嗎?
Let me ask you, has your company done business recently with a Mr. Bert Hanson?

1518
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,580
- 巴布爾·范松? 沒聽說過 - 的確沒有
- Barb Fanson? Doesn't ring a bell. - Not really ringing a bell.

1519
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,780
- 我也覺得沒聽說過 - 我們不認識他
- I don't think that we have. - Not our guy.

1520
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,820
那還真是有意思 據我所知 你們正和他合作
That's interesting. The way I hear it, you're working with him.

1521
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,820
事情對你們很不利
And things didn't shake out too well for you boys.

1522
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,260
- 噢 伯特 - 噢 伯特·漢森
- Oh, Bert. - Oh. Bert Hanson.

1523
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,740
- 沒錯 - 他是那麼說的嗎?
- Yeah. - Is that what he said?

1524
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,140
- 伯特·漢森? 是的 我們認識他 - 那老頭
- Bert Hanson? Oh, yeah. We know him. - That guy.

1525
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,910
我們有利益衝突
We had a business disagreement.

1526
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,660
- 很大 - 沒什麼大不了
- Big whoop. - No big deal.

1527
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,900
- 事情都過去了 - 我們對那傢伙超級友好
- Water under the bridge. - We're super friendly with the guy.

1528
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,060
你們真寬容
You're very forgiving.

1529
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,500
因為幾乎所有我談話的都認為他是混球
Because almost everyone I've talked to thinks he's an asshole.

1530
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,460
- 他們是那樣認為的? - 我可以理解
- Do they think that? - I could see that.

1531
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,700
言辭激烈 我不知道是否會那麼說
Strong word. I don't know if I'd use it.

1532
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,300
我們喜歡他 當然他兒子不該被綁架
We like the guy. Definitely don't think his son deserves to be kidnapped.

1533
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,070
綁架?
Kidnapped?

1534
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,420
誰提了綁架一事?
Who said anything about kidnapping?

1535
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,100
- 我想是你說了 - 我沒有
- I wanna say you did. - I didn't.

1536
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,460
- 我聽你說了 - 我沒有
- I heard you say it. - I didn't.

1537
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,380
- 我也覺得你說了 - 我確信沒有
- I feel like you did. - I'm sure I did.

1538
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,100
你說了"綁架" 我還想"多奇怪的用詞"
You said "kidnapping." I was like, "What a weird word."

1539
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,580
- 有點像"綁家" - 不 沒有 我說了嗎?
- Should be more "kidnabbing." - No, I did not. Did I say that?

1540
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,260
- 我想可能有吧 長官 - 你確定?
- I think you might have, sir. - You sure?

1541
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,740
他們亂吵的時候我走神了 但很確定有
Well, I got a little lost with all their yammering, but pretty sure.

1542
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,060
好吧 可能我說了
All right, maybe I did.

1543
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,220
- 嗨 - 難熬的一週
- Hey. - It's been a long week.

1544
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,620
還會在聯絡
We'll be in touch.

1545
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,620
是 隨時
Yeah. Anytime you want.

1546
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:33,540
不要擔心 因為你透露的大事...
Don't worry, because the main thing is that you said it...

1547
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,100
別提了 別提了
Stop talking. Stop talking.

1548
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,740
你說得夠多了 夠了
You've done plenty, plenty of talking.

1549
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,910
你去哪? 回來 過來 我們去這裡
Where you going? Come back here. Come over here. We're going this way.

1550
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,580
不用謝我 回家享受天倫之樂吧
I don't want you to thank me. Just go home and enjoy your family.

1551
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,380
享受假期吧 伙伴們 你們掙來的
Enjoy the rest of the day off, everyone. You've earned it.

1552
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,940
警察來查過了 確保晚上都鎖門了
The police were just checking. Making sure we're locking up at night.

1553
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,220
他們維護鄰里安全 他們是英雄
You know, they're keeping the neighborhood safe. They're heroes.

1554
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,060
好了 都安頓好了
Okay, all taken care of.

1555
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,940
- 沒事 大家都走了 - 不 不 他...
- No, everyone's gone. - No, no, he...

1556
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,380
他崩潰了
He's spinning out.

1557
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,140
我很清楚我性命攸關
I was really clear my life was in danger.

1558
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,940
他卻還是報警了
He called the police anyway.

1559
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,340
沒錯 自從他報警...
Yeah, and since he did...

1560
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,100
現在很明瞭了我們不能再繼續騙局了...
it's pretty clear that we're not gonna be able to continue with the scam...

1561
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,060
五百萬對他來說毛毛雨
Five million dollars is nothing to him.

1562
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,140
但我想我還不如那些錢
But I guess it's worth more to him than my life.

1563
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,580
- 看在老天分上 我是他兒子 - 噢 天 都成淚人了
- I'm his son, for chrissake. - Oh, boy. We got a crier.

1564
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,410
瞧瞧他哭的時候眼睛水汪汪的
Look how blue his eyes get when he's crying.

1565
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,300
抱歉 真他媽的尷尬
I'm sorry. This is so fucking embarrassing.

1566
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,780
- 噢 沒有 不 不 不 - 沒有
- Oh, no. No, no, no. - No.

1567
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,900
給廁紙 你可以擦擦鼻子
Toilet paper here. You can blow your nose.

1568
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,530
你父親報警
Just because your dad called the cops

1569
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,980
不意味著他不愛你
doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

1570
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,480
是的 當然不意味
No, of course not.

1571
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,820
哦 天啊 我想這是他的第一反應
Oh, my gosh. I'm sure it was just his first reaction.

1572
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,740
- 他嚇壞了 迷惘 - 這是本能 黛爾就是位父親
- He's scared, confused. - It's natural. I mean, Dale's a dad.

1573
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,100
我也是當爸爸的
I'm a dad.

1574
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,260
你能想像有人搶走其中一個孩子?
Can you imagine if someone stole one of them?

1575
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,380
- 無法想像 - 你會報警
- I can't imagine. - You would call the cops.

1576
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,260
不 我想不會報警 我承擔不了那風險
No, I don't think I'd call the cops. I couldn't take that risk.

1577
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,340
- 不同情況 - 操 抱歉
- Different situation. - Shit, I'm sorry.

1578
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,620
壞例子
Bad example.

1579
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,700
也許獨處會有用
Maybe some alone time would be helpful.

1580
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,980
我們出去 讓他靜靜?
Why don't we step outside, give him a minute?

1581
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,260
我們會回來的 不要做傻事
We'll come back, don't do anything rash.

1582
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,390
那根松點的繩子 我不希望他...
Get the loose rope. I don't want him to...

1583
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,460
我們只能自求多福
We can only hope.

1584
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,380
我們去外面談談?
Can I talk to you outside, please?

1585
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,260
- 噢 天啊 - 兄弟 我為那傢伙難過
- Oh, boy. - Man, I feel terrible for that guy.

1586
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,260
我明白 你在開玩笑? 可憐 可憐的娃
I know. Are you kidding me? Poor, poor guy.

1587
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,990
這是很艱難 艱難
I mean, that is rough. Rough.

1588
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,620
你們是在拆我台嗎?
Are you guys shitting me in there?

1589
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,540
他父親不要他為了... 對於他可能就是無足輕重
His dad sold him out for... It was probably nothing to him.

1590
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,180
- 錢於他 - 那傢伙不差錢
- Pennies to him. - The guy's rich.

1591
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,380
都撼動我內心了 請有點同情?
That would rock me to my core. Have a little empathy. Please?

1592
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,320
知道現在什麼情況嗎? 你心懷怨憤
Know what's going on? You're holding a grudge right now.

1593
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,500
是的 就是那樣
Yes, you do that.

1594
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,260
- 你做什麼都繃緊 會得癌症的 - 確實
- You get all tight. You're gonna get cancer. - You do.

1595
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,820
- 我也不想那樣 - 讓往事隨風而去
- I don't want that. - Let the past be the past.

1596
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,660
我們沒有在過去
We're not in the fucking past.

1597
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,500
我們是進行中 而你們...
We're in the goddamn present. And you guys...

1598
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,140
你們在談什麼? 你們像是患有斯德哥爾摩症
What are you talking about? You're acting like you have Stockholm Syndrome.

1599
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,140
斯德哥爾摩症:被劫持人質對劫持者產生好感並同情、寬容他

1600
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,300
什麼?
What is that?

1601
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,620
- 什麼 像是倒時差? - 不
- What, like jet lag? - No.

1602
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,620
- 你們看我累嗎? - 你沒有 沒有
- Do I look tired to you? - You don't. No.

1603
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,300
- 你看起來不疲倦 - 我很好
- You don't look tired. - I'm fine.

1604
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,940
斯德哥爾摩症發生在你與捕手緊密相連
Stockholm Syndrome's when you bond with your captors.

1605
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,820
噢 好了 等等 才是人質
Oh, okay. Well, then hold on a second. He's the hostage.

1606
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,260
所以這是反斯德哥爾摩症
So this would be reverse Stockholm Syndrome.

1607
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,980
沒錯 我們沒有 好嗎?
Yeah, and we don't have that, okay?

1608
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,780
他只是一個非常 非常 非常可愛的傢伙 我很喜歡他
He's just a really, really, really likable guy. I like him a lot.

1609
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,860
- 他很招人愛 - 他才是贏家
- He's really likable. - The guy's a winner.

1610
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,580
跟著贏的人混才是好的
It's nice to be around a winner.

1611
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,170
噢 天 直覺是對的 尼克 算了
Oh, boy. It feels right, Nick. Come on.

1612
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,420
我們要做的就是
Here's what we're gonna do.

1613
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,540
我們進去 告訴他我們撤出這個計劃....
We're gonna go in, tell him cops were never part of this plan...

1614
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,340
以及現在這破事結束了 走
and the shit ends now. Let's do it.

1615
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,480
好 但聽聽我們的怨憤
Okay, but hear us out about festering.

1616
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,060
你就不能好好談話
 Like you can't have a conversation.

1617
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,740
這是個好主意 只是沒奏效
It was a wonderful idea. Didn't work out.

1618
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,620
所以我們最好回歸正軌...
So I think the best thing to do is just to pull the plug...

1619
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,300
然後你去告訴警察那些綁你的人臨陣退縮了...
and you tell the police that the guys who got you chickened out...

1620
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,180
放走了你 他們遠走高飛了
let you go, they're long gone.

1621
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,190
他們沒有全部臨陣退縮
They didn't all chicken out.

1622
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,260
現在不是退出的時候 哥們
Now's not the time to back off, boys.

1623
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,660
我說我們砍掉一個腳趾 寄給他要雙倍贖金
I say we chop off a toe, mail it to him and double the ransom.

1624
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,170
現在你能說話了 砍 砍 砍
Now you're talking. Chop, chop, chop.

1625
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,420
沒錯! 等等 誰的腳趾?
Yes! Wait, whose toe?

1626
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,860
- 不是 不是 不是我的 - 誰的都不是
- Not it. Not it. Not my toe. - No one's toe.

1627
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,020
收好你的腳趾 該撤了
Keep your toes. Time to call it off.

1628
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,860
尼克 尼克 來嘛
Nick. Nick. Come on.

1629
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,060
- 尼克 看著我 - 唉
- Nick, look at me. - Oy.

1630
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,980
聽著 如果我們現在放棄 我會沒事 對吧?
Look, man, if we give up now, I'll be just fine, you know?

1631
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,220
但你們 你的員工 老天
But you guys, your employees, for God's sake.

1632
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,380
- 黛爾的小兔崽子 - 女孩們 庫爾特
- Dale's little boys. - Girls, Kurt.

1633
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,020
- 嗨 謝謝 是的 - 沒錯 你們都完蛋了
- Hey, thanks. Yes. - Yeah. You're all fucked.

1634
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,580
- 尼克 繼續吧 - 繼續吧
- Nick, come on. - Come on.

1635
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,620
你陷於囹圄之境唯有死路一條
You can't roll over and die when your back's against the wall.

1636
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,020
- 不要自找死路 - 你得謹慎
- Don't roll over and die. - You gotta be careful.

1637
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,060
- 你得拿回屬於你的 - 要回!
- You have to take what's yours. - Take it!

1638
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,260
報上你名 寫下名字並說 "那是我的"
Put your name on it. Write your name on it and say, "That's mine."

1639
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,540
並奪回
And take it.

1640
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,460
我想這裡還是由我來主導 好嗎?
I think I'll take it from here, okay?

1641
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,740
- 他懂的- 他懂的 他聽著呢
- He's got it. - He's got it. Listen right here.

1642
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,180
- 這就是你想要的 - 不是我們
- This is where you want it to come from. - Not us.

1643
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,740
- 我知道了! - 抱歉 雷克斯 抱歉
- I got it! - Sorry, Rex. Sorry.

1644
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,780
- 他明白 - 得了 哥們
- He's got it. - Come on, man.

1645
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,860
幫我也幫你們向我那混蛋老爹復仇
Help me help you get revenge on my asshole dad...

1646
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,900
- ... 你們還會有一百萬的回報 - 沒錯
- ...and get you paid a million bucks cash. - Yes.

1647
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,140
伙伴們 聽起來棒極了 但沒辦法實現
Boy, it sounds awesome, but there's no way to get it done.

1648
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,740
那是不對的這樣如何?
That's not true. How about this?

1649
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,100
我們集思廣益如何? 腦力激盪一下
How about if we just put our heads together? We brainstorm a little.

1650
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,440
如果我們想不出你喜歡的贖金計劃
If we don't come up with a ransom plan that you love,

1651
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,460
我們就撤消
we pull the plug.

1652
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,900
- 那時你放我們走? - 我保證
- Then you'd let us walk? - You have my word.

1653
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,180
但如果我們想出了振奮人心的...
But if we do come up with something really inspired...

1654
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,380
那我們就加入奪金
then we're in it to win it.

1655
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,620
好吧 我阻止不了腦力激盪
Well, I can't stop anybody from brainstorming.

1656
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,100
你最好了
You're the best.

1657
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,540
- 好了 - 樓上見 伙伴們
- All right. - I'll see you upstairs, man.

1658
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,420
"陰道"帶G還是J?
Is "vagina" with a G or a J?

1659
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,740
好了
All right.

1660
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,780
我們從頭到尾理一遍
Let's run it down from the top.

1661
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,520
好 首先我們把雷克斯綁在
Okay. First we tie up Rex

1662
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,460
第三街區一間被遺棄的倉庫
in one of those abandoned warehouses off 3rd.

1663
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,220
然後用一次性手機打給伯特 手機是預付費而且不可追蹤的
Then we call Bert on a dark phone. It's prepaid and untraceable.

1664
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,620
到四號街區橋的長椅進行投放
Go to the bench on the 4th Street Bridge to make the drop.

1665
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,620
時間很短追蹤不到電話
Not long enough to trace the call.

1666
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,740
靠
Goddamn it.

1667
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,900
這群傢伙是專業的
These guys are pros.

1668
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,300
我要把追蹤器放包裡
I want a tracer put in that bag.

1669
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,980
警察把手底下所有人派往橋邊監視
The police are sending everyone they've got to watch the bridge.

1670
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,540
整裝待發 全程戒備
Weapons tight. Eyes on.

1671
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,310
好吧 戰術指令 紅色小隊
All right, tactical command, red team.

1672
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,110
我們到了
Here we go.

1673
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,540
但當他到那裡...
But when he gets there...

1674
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,860
他找到我預先放置的一次性手機
he finds the dark phone that I planted ahead of time.

1675
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,180
然後我們用另一隻一次性手機打給他
Then we call him from the second dark phone,

1676
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,260
告訴他去市中心
and tell him to proceed downtown.

1677
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,540
你好
Hello.

1678
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,000
你要去曼德拉草賓館下的車庫
You'll wanna pull into the garage under the Mandrake Hotel

1679
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,740
並停在4421車位
and park in Space 4421.

1680
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,380
然後你會找到一個紅包
There, you will find a red bag.

1681
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,820
把錢裝入那個包裡 然後開出去等待下一個投放地點
You will transfer the money into this bag, then drive out and await the location of the drop.

1682
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,140
然後我們告訴他如果有人跟蹤他
And we tell him if anyone follows him in,

1683
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,180
他兒子就沒命了
his son's a fucking corpse.

1684
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,860
當伯特開到足夠地下
And when Bert drives that far underground...

1685
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,340
警方就會沒有他的信號
the police will lose the signal from his wire.

1686
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,220
但等他到達時 等待他的不是包而是你們三人
But when he arrives, instead of finding a bag he finds you three.

1687
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,580
偽裝 武裝 危險
Disguised. Armed. Dangerous.

1688
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,800
沒錯 但槍沒上膛 是吧?
Yeah, but the gun's not loaded, right?

1689
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,780
當然 不會有人受傷 繼續
Of course not. Nobody gets hurt, come on.

1690
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,860
然後我告訴他脫下外套和領帶
I then tell him to give me his jacket and tie.

1691
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:19,180
讀讀這個:我身上還有現金 要開車去停車點

1692
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,580
所以當警察開始急得直冒號時...
So just as the cops are starting to sweat...

1693
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,820
爸爸按指令扔下新的紅色包包
Dad pulls out with the new red bag, just as he was instructed.

1694
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,830
- 長官 我們又有信號了 - 謝天謝地
- Sir, we have the signal back. - Thank God.

1695
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,380
只是開車的不是我父親 而是我們的替身
Only it won't be my father driving. It'll be our ringer.

1696
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,540
- 我們重新找到他了 - 你怎麼知道是他?
- We're back on him, sir. - How do you know it's him?

1697
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,460
現金還在我身上 我要去停車點
I still have the cash and I'm heading to the drop.

1698
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,100
我想是他 跟著他
I guess it's him. Stay with him.

1699
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,260
然後我開車到斯特普爾特中心
So I drive to the Staples Center.

1700
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,620
國王對多倫多 熱門比賽 人群擁擠
Kings have Vancouver. Great matchup. Place will be packed.

1701
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,780
警察會盯著錢 等綁匪收錢
Cops will stay with the money, wait for the kidnappers to receive the drop.

1702
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,300
漢森投放了 盯好錢
Hanson made the drop, stay on the money.

1703
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,820
我們發現要找的人了 抓住他
We got our man. Take him down.

1704
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,540
趴下
Stay down.

1705
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,660
婊娘養的
Son of a bitch.

1706
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,340
到那時警察明白他們被...
By the time the cops know they've been had...

1707
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,620
庫爾特就是幽靈替身
Kurt's a ghost.

1708
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,230
尼克和黛爾帶著錢消失
And Nick and Dale disappear with the cash.

1709
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,420
最後我也從監禁中獲救
And, finally, I am rescued from my hellish captivity.

1710
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,270
謝謝 我父親呢?
Thank you. Where's my dad?

1711
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,900
爸爸!
Dad!

1712
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,950
一週後 風聲過去
A week later, once the smoke clears,

1713
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,620
我們坐在泳池邊 分贓
we'll be sitting poolside, splitting up the cash.

1714
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,420
錢到處飛舞 誰想要?足夠我們分
It's raining. Who wants it? There's enough to share.

1715
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,660
看誰來了 誰想要些龍舌蘭?
Look what came. Who wants some tequila?

1716
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,980
- 是現金 - 謝謝 寶貝
- It's cash. - Thanks, babe.

1717
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,220
嗨 哇噢 黛爾
Hey, whoa, Dale.

1718
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,900
把你孩子扔出去幻想中
Get your goddamn kids out of the fantasy.

1719
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,180
讓他們享受泳池 讓我享受金錢
Let them enjoy the pool, let me enjoy the money.

1720
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,210
他們都不被允許待在泳池
They're not even allowed at this pool.

1721
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,460
我腦海裡去不掉
I can't turn my mind off.

1722
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,260
- 伙伴們 伙伴們 伙伴們 - 你要阻止嗎?
- Guys. Guys. Guys. - Will you stop it?

1723
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,920
得了 不要爭了 好嗎?
Come on. Let's not argue, okay?

1724
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,060
我們想了個絕妙的計劃
We came up with an awesome plan.

1725
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,260
很有才 太開創了
It is smart. It is mad creative.

1726
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,900
你們又讓我印象深刻
You know, you boys continue to impress me.

1727
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,900
- 我為你們驕傲 - 謝謝 哥們
- I'm proud of you. - Thanks, man.

1728
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,380
- 但你才是想出大部分的那個 - 我沒有
- You came up with most of it, though. - I did not.

1729
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,660
- 你有 - 那是謊話 是集體的功勞
- You did. - That is a lie. It was a team effort.

1730
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,500
你想出了去車庫 切斷信號
You came up with going into the garage, losing the signal.

1731
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,700
太妙了 小K想出了一次性手機那碼事
That was brilliant. Kurty came up with the dark-phone business.

1732
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,900
- 那是從俠盜獵車手來的靈感 - 天才 黛爾...
- That's from "Grand Theft Auto." I took it. - Genius. Dale...

1733
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,900
我想到了你從滑索下到蹦床然後滑板跑路
I had the thing where you go on the zip line to the trampoline to the skateboard.

1734
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,900
如果你還記得 尼克否決了
Nick shot that down, if you remember.

1735
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,420
沒錯 那不是個好主意
Yeah. It wasn't a good idea.

1736
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,140
那是個糟糕的主意 實際上
It was a bad idea, it really was.

1737
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,350
你老有一堆壞主意但最後拋磚引玉出好主意
You had a lot of bad ideas though that led to good ideas.

1738
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,980
很有價值
And that is value.

1739
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,780
謝謝 伙伴
Thanks, man.

1740
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,140
好了 尼克 聽著 我的保證依舊有效
All right, Nick. Look, my word is still good.

1741
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,420
如果你認為計劃不會成功 我們可以取消
You know, if you don't think it can work, we call it off.

1742
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,860
由你決定 伙伴
It's up to you, buddy.

1743
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,620
我們上哪去找不被追逐的手機?
Where do we get untraceable phones?

1744
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,020
成了 這才是我們的好伙伴
There we go. That's our guy.

1745
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,790
- 這傢伙 - 成了
- This guy. - There we go.

1746
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,460
用比特幣預付過了
Prepaid with bitcoins.

1747
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,140
越獄版
Jailbroken.

1748
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,820
百分百不可追蹤
A hundred percent untraceable.

1749
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,380
- 我們有了- 謝謝 可靠 謝謝 草你媽
- We got it. - Thanks. Solid. Thank you, Motherfucker.

1750
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,660
祝好運 伙伴們
Good luck out there, boys.

1751
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,500
- 他笑什麼? - 我只是祝好運
- What's that laugh about? - I just said good luck.

1752
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,930
那是陰笑
That was a sinister giggle.

1753
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,660
你陰笑著說這話
You said it with a sinister giggle.

1754
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,780
我只是說也許你們需要一些設備
I'm just saying that maybe you guys might want a little advice.

1755
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,780
- 伙伴們 那是可想而知的 不 謝謝 - 我們很好
- Boy, that was predictable. No, thanks. - We're good.

1756
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,070
那你知道後續怎麼著嗎? 挫事一堆
You know what, then? Get the fuck on.

1757
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,460
就是我說的 一堆挫事
That's what I said. Get the fuck on.

1758
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,220
- 等等 - 我不喜歡這樣
- Wait a minute. - I don't like this.

1759
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,980
- 我想聽聽他怎麼說 - 現在你想聽了?
- I wanna hear what he has to say. - Now you wanna hear?

1760
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,530
你們綁架了一個
You got one on the hook.

1761
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,700
會花去你們百分之五十一的錢
It'll cost 51 percent share of your company.

1762
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,980
你想錯了
You're out of your fucking mind.

1763
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,860
會花去你們百分之二的錢
It's gonna cost you 2 percent share of your company.

1764
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,840
你討價還價的方式真怪異
So weird how you negotiate.

1765
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,460
不需要了 你可以走了
It won't be in existence. You can have that.

1766
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,820
- 還有轉寰餘地 - 給你們點建議 年輕人
- There's a middle ground. - Here's the advice, young men.

1767
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,500
你們都是罪犯
Y'all criminals.

1768
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,300
- 根本沒過好建議 - 我不接受
- It's never good advice. - I can't find the advice.

1769
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,700
事實上 都不是真的 我們不是罪犯 對吧?
It's not even true, actually. We're not criminals. All right?

1770
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,540
- 我們泥足深陷了 - 閉嘴
- We got dicked into this. - Shut up.

1771
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,180
明白了 你們不能兩全其美
See, you can't have this both ways.

1772
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,300
每次你們過來 你們看來就是
Every time you guys come here, you're like,

1773
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,180
"我們是群快樂又幸運的傢伙"
"We're a bunch of happy-go-lucky guys.

1774
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,500
我們沒有犯任何錯 卻又深陷困境
Through no fault of our own, we found ourselves in another pickle.

1775
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,510
我們沒辦法抽身" 去他媽的
We can't get our fingers out of our asses." Fuck that.

1776
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,460
你們是娘的罪犯 我們試圖謀殺老闆
You're fucking criminals. You've tried to kill your bosses.

1777
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,140
到最後有一個人喪命 而現在你們幹綁票?
One of them ended up dead. And now you want to perpetrate a kidnapping?

1778
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:35,740
你們三人是我這輩子見過的最瘋狂的草你媽罪犯
You three are the craziest motherfucking criminals I've ever seen in my life.

1779
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,510
你們想要安全脫身?
You wanna pull this shit off?

1780
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,100
你們就要那麼幹
You gotta act like it.

1781
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,260
精闢
Word.

1782
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,660
噢 真尷尬
Oh. That was embarrassing.

1783
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,900
我們想要走個超級酷的慢貓步
We're trying to do a super cool slow-mo walk.

1784
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,500
- 繼續 伙伴 - 放鬆
- Come on, man. - Easy.

1785
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,420
- 過去了 我們走吧 - 去哪?
- It's over. Let's go. - Where you going?

1786
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,970
幼稚的主意 我羞愧了
Moronic idea. I am mortified.

1787
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,540
來嘛 哥們 我們繼續貓步
Come on, man. Let's do the walk.

1788
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,230
你得堅持
You gotta stick with it.

1789
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,380
你認為怎麼樣? 我需要再打自己兩拳?
What do you think? Should I beat myself up more?

1790
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,410
不 你不需要再打自己了
No, you don't need to hit yourself anymore.

1791
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,340
我想我們只要打電話就好了
I think we should just make the call.

1792
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,620
等等 在我們開始前 我能說點什麼嗎?
Hold on. Before we kick this thing off, can I just say something?

1793
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,540
我不是很 擅長這種事
I'm not really, good at this kind of thing, you know?

1794
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,780
我媽媽在我四歲時去世...
My mom died when I was 4, and...

1795
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,460
在你由伯特·漢森養大的情況下...
You know, when you're raised by Bert Hanson...

1796
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,580
大部分朋友都是狐朋狗友
most of your friends are shitheads.

1797
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,100
是的 我知道我把你們扯進這裡 但我很抱歉
Yeah. I know I dragged you guys into this, but I'm not sorry.

1798
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,630
因為...
Because...

1799
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,460
我真的很高興遇到你們
I'm really glad I met you guys.

1800
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,260
不管怎樣 我希望你們收下這個
Anyway, I want you guys to have this.

1801
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,620
- 是什麼? - 是鐵血戰士裡的用過的毒牙
- What is it? - It's an actual fang from Predator.

1802
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,260
- 那部電影鐵血戰士? - 沒錯
- Predator the movie? - Yep.

1803
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,580
我想把這個給你
I want you to have it.

1804
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,980
- 真的? - 我發誓
- For real? - Swear to God.

1805
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,660
你喜歡鐵血戰士嗎?
Do you like Predator?

1806
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,980
是啊 我喜歡鐵血戰士
Yeah, I like Predator.

1807
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,300
- 庫爾特呢? - 對 對 我也喜歡鐵血戰士
- Kurty? - Yeah. Yeah, I like Predator too.

1808
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,420
我意思是我也喜歡 不是喜歡續集
I mean "also," not the sequel.

1809
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,020
- 尼克呢? - 額 這個
- Nick? - Oh, well...

1810
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,460
我第一次看鐵血戰士的時候不是很喜歡
I didn't like Predator when I first saw it...

1811
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,500
但是我越來越喜歡了
but it grew on me quite a bit.

1812
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,340
我很喜歡鐵血戰士
I like Predator a great deal.

1813
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,490
我們在說他還是電影
Are we talking about him or Predator?

1814
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:20,820
我討厭話裡有話
I'm terrible with metaphors.

1815
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,180
- 來讓我們打電話吧 - 你們把我搞糊塗了
- Let's make the phone call. - It was lost on me.

1816
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,420
很多事都這樣
Most things are.

1817
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,140
你好
Yeah.

1818
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,620
你們收到那筆錢了嗎?
You got that cash?

1819
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,500
- 是的 我收到了 - 耶
- Yeah, I got it. - Yeah.

1820
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,260
現在我需要你大搖大擺的走到第四街大橋
Now, I want you to sashay up to the 4th Street Bridge.

1821
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,340
你會在半路上發現有一個板凳 坐下來
You're gonna find a bench about halfway up, take a load off.

1822
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,660
你單獨帶著我們說好的錢來
And you bring the amount that we agreed upon and you come alone.

1823
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,280
如果你這麼做了
And if you do,

1824
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,180
你兒子就能速速的回家
you will find your son returned home lickety-splickety.

1825
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,260
第四街大橋 他會把他扔到那
Fourth Street Bridge, he's gonna have him drop it over the side.

1826
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,630
現在 我希望所有地方都在
Now, I want every inch covered,

1827
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,340
安全距離內覆蓋警力
but everyone holds a safe distance.

1828
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,660
好的 但是距離也別太安全 懂了嗎?
Yeah, but not too safe a distance. Understand?

1829
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,380
這個包是你最重要的東西
This bag is your number fucking one priority.

1830
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,540
不 實際上 我兒子才是最重要的
No, actually, your son's life is our number one priority.

1831
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,070
是的 你知道我什麼意思
Yeah, you know what I mean.

1832
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,900
或許我知道吧
Yeah, I think I do.

1833
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,390
誰能看清?
Does anybody have a visual?

1834
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,060
大橋上仍然是空的 老大
Bridge is still clear, chief.

1835
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,700
漢森預計兩分鐘到達
Hanson approaching. ETA, two minutes.

Ooh.We don't wanna use real names if we're using code names, Dale.

1844
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,010
別把我名字說出來 庫爾特
Don't say my name, Kurt.

1845
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,580
我那是意外 你是故意的
Mine was an accident. Yours was on purpose.

1846
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,740
- 我不覺得你是無心的 - 你說什麼?
- I don't think yours was an accident. - What?

1847
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,060
為什麼我們在一個房間裡還用對講機
Why are we on walkie-talkies in the same room?

1848
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,540
我們是在檢查設備
We're checking the equipment.

1849

We don't need to. He's on a TV remote control.

You're gonna see a big old bag there. Fill it up.

1889
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,900
然後接著北上到菲格羅阿
And then I need you to proceed north onto Figueroa

1890
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,500
等待我的下一步指示

1891
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,700
等等 等等
Wait, wait.

1892
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,030
你以為我們不知道你和警察在一起嗎
And don't think we don't know you got the law with you.

1893
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,980
我們都知道
That's something we do know.

1894
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,340
對嗎? 所以如果他們跟你去車庫...
All right? So if any of them cavalry follow you down in the garage...

1895
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,740
我會像打撲克一樣打你兒子的屁股
I'm personally gonna stick a hot poker so far up your son's ass...

1896

With game-time traffic, he could be here in less than 10 minutes. How we doing?

1901
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,220
- 差不多了 - 服務生的衣服去哪了?
- Almost done. - Where are the bellhop costumes?

1902
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,540
- 什麼? - 服務生的衣服
- What? - Bellhop costumes.

1903
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,620
我們不是要穿著服務生的衣服逃走嗎?
Aren't we dressed as bellhops when we escape with the money?

1904
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,340
那裡沒有服務生
This place doesn't have bellhops.

1905
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,540
- 沒有? - 沒有
- It doesn't? - No.

1906
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,220
我以為那有一些小甜心呢
I thought there was supposed to be some sweet-ass...

1907
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,540
- 這是什麼鬼東西? - 今天可不是鬼節
- What the fuck are these? - It's not Halloween.

1908
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,980
- 我在最短的時間內只能做到這樣了 - 這個不嚇人
- Best I could do on short notice. - It's not scary.

1909
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,220
- 嘿 我看起來怎麼樣? - 你是什麼鬼?
- Hey, how do I look? - Who the hell are you?

1910
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,060
- 我是庫爾特 - 我知道
- It's me, Kurt. - I know that part.

1911
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,060
太糟糕了 你看起來不像伯特 像馬克吐溫
Terrible. You don't look like Bert, you look like Mark Twain.

1912
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:49,940
沒有一件事是按照計劃來的 一切都搞砸了
None of this is like I pictured when we were planning it. Everything was cooler.

1913
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,300
他遠看還是不錯的
He just has to look good from a distance.

1914
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,540
- 我們走 開始吧 - 我們動手吧
- Here we go. Let's do it. - Let's roll.

1915
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,380
我們只要各就各位有信心我們就會好好的
Let's just do what we gotta do, do it confidently and, we should be fine.

1916
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,220
- 我們走 - 哦
- Here we go. - Oh.

1917
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,740
- 嗨 小伙子們 - 哦 嗨
- Hi, boys. - Oh, hi.

1918
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:03,840
你住在酒店
You staying at the hotel,

1919
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,220
還是這是你的酒店? 你在這住嗎?
or is this your hotel? You staying here?

1920
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,020
從你們闖進我的辦公室開始我一直關注著你們
I've been keeping my eye on you since you broke into my office.

1921
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,140
我不知道這裡發生了什麼 而且我一點也不關心
I don't know what's going on here, and I don't give a shit.

1922
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,200
你為什麼在這? 你想要什麼?
Why are you here? What do you want?

1923
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,700
我感覺你知道我想要什麼
I think you know what I want.

1924
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,420
不 我是不會和你上床的
No, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

1925
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,900
這個瘋女人在想什麼啊?
Why can't this crazy bitch get it through her head?

1926
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,540
- 放尊重點 對不起 - 你在耍我嗎?
- Keep it respectful. Sorry. - Are you kidding me?

1927
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,140
- 別這麼說她 - 我在努力搞清這件事
- Don't call her that. - I'm gonna make this simple.

1928
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,460
我要叫警察來把你們送到監獄裡去
I'm gonna call the police and send you to jail.

1929
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,740
- 別這樣 - 別啊
- Don't do that. - Come on.

1930
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,700
除非黛爾上我
Unless Dale plows me.

1931
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,660
為什麼? 為什麼是我? 我有什麼特別的?
Why? Why me? What is so special about me?

1932
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,180
這是個合理的疑問 所有人都想知道
That's a fair question. Everybody's wondering.

1933
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,940
- 我也是 - 黛爾你有收藏過什麼東西嗎?
- I am. - Did you ever collect anything, Dale?

1934
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,380
- 不要讓他捲入這件事 - 我收藏什麼?
- Don't get him going on this. - What do I collect?

1935
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,180
- 可多了 - 布朗百科全書?
- Tons of stuff. - Encyclopedia Brown?

1936
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,100
- 新的豆豆娃娃不算 - 銀河戰星
- New Beanie Babies, makes no sense. - Battlestar Galactica.

1937
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,200
好吧 我會收藏一些東西 怎麼了?
Fine. I collect some stuff. Why?

1938
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,260
好吧 我收藏雞雞
Okay, well, I collect cocks.

1939
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,580
- 齒輪? - 朱莉亞
- Cogs? - Julia.

1940
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,780
- 雞雞 - 哦 額 好吧
- "Cocks." - Oh, yeah. Well...

1941
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,860
就在這
Right up here.

1942
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,580
我有一個陳列著滿滿的雞雞們的陳列室
I've got quite an impressive trophy room filled with cocks.

1943
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,020
- 我們就在這 - 別
- We're in there. - Don't.

1944
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,980
在夜裡 我閉上我的雙眼
And at night, when I close my eyes...

1945
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,980
我回想它們
I reflect on them...

1946
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,260
我排列它們
I alphabetize them...

1947
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,980
我為它們拂去塵埃
I dust them.

1948
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,780
它們為什麼落灰了?
Why are they dusty?

1949
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,180
但是還有一個小問題 黛爾
But there's one little problem, Dale.

1950
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,820
看到那個地方了嗎? 壁爐上面空蕩蕩的地方?
See that space? That empty space above the fireplace?

1951
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,340
- 看到了嗎? - 你缺一隻雞雞?
- See that? - You got a cock missing?

1952
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,340
這是為我十一歲起
That's reserved for the only man who's ever said no to this.

1953
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,980
唯一說不的男人留個位置
Since I was 11 years old.

1954
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,980
就是你 黛爾
That's you, Dale.

1955
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,580
我的白鯨
My white whale.

1956
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,860
哦 好吧 我很感激 真的 我猜那很甜蜜
Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that. I really do. That's sweet, I guess.

1957
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,820
但是 嘿 現在有個辦法 我的朋友庫爾特喜歡開墾荒田
But, hey, here's an idea. My friend Kurt here loves to plow.

1958
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,260
- 而且他一定比我厲害 - 絕對的
- And maybe he could jump in for me... - Absolutely.

1959
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,500
我可以補充一下 我有真的活好
I could pinch-plow. I got a real green thumb.

1960
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,110
我們都知道這會兒聊上癮了
We all know this is just the addiction talking.

1961
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,020
如果你想要的不止快速解決...
If you're looking for more than a quick fix...

1962
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,380
我可以給你提供一樣富有含義還持久的東西
I can provide you something that's very meaningful, long-lasting.

1963
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,910
什麼? 你在說什麼?
What? What are you talking about?

1964
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,420
我在說我們
I'm talking about us.

1965
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,380
- 我們? 我們所有人? - 不
- Us? All of us? - No.

1966
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,620
- 那就更好了 - 不
- That's even better. - No.

1967
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,580
越多越好 我喜歡這個點子
More the merrier. I love this idea.

1968
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,020
你們有很多堅挺的東西
You got a lot of stuff sticking out.

1969
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,780
我有很多洞做它們的去處
I got a lot of holes going in.

1970
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,060
晚上有一點你們必須要搞清楚
At one point of the night, you'd better make sure that,

1971
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,780
就只有一個棍棍在洞洞裡
that one is in this one.

1972
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,580
- 謝謝 - 那不是我的意思 我誤解了
- Thank you. - That's not what I meant. You misunderstood.

1973
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,140
我去梳洗一下 你們要做點什麼準備嗎?
I'm gonna go freshen up. Why don't you guys suck each other off to get ready?

1974
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,300
- 我們來吧 - 你在幹什麼?
Here we go. - What are you doing?

1975
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,940
什麼? 她讓我們上她?
What? She's making us fuck her.

1976
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,900
- 我誰都不睡 - 謝謝
- I'm not gonna fuck anyone. - Thank you.

1977
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,460
我願意和她做愛 如果她需要的話
I'm willing to make love to her, if that's required.

1978
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,820
- 你是認真的嗎? - 我可以借用一下這個剃刀嗎?
- Are you serious? - Can I borrow this razor?

1979
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,380
可以 隨便用
Yeah. Go nuts.

1980
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,700
有什麼要求嗎?  捆綁?  旋轉?
Any requests? Landing strip? Dinner roll?

1981
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,140
隨便啦 我們趕時間 謝謝
Whatever's there. We're in a rush. Thanks.

1982
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,060
我不想出軌
I don't wanna commit adultery on my wife.

1983
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,540
不 如果你是為了救你的家庭就不是出軌好嗎
No, it's not adultery if you're doing it to save your family. Okay?

1984
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,420
你覺得你在監獄裡關三十年
You think Stacy and your girls are gonna wait for you...

1985
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,280
史黛西和你的孩子們會等你?
...while you're in prison for 30 years?

1986
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,060
他們不會的
They're not.

1987
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,780
我們就不能想想辦法嗎?
Can't we just come up with some kind of plan, though?

1988
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,980
哦 好 絕對的 我有辦法了 好 我們走
Oh, yes. Absolutely. I got a plan. Okay, here we go. Areas.

1989
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,820
我選屁股 臉 陰道
I'll go butt, face, puss.

1990
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,660
我不要進陰道 這讓我最有負罪感臉
I cannot go in the puss. That'll make me the most guilty.

1991
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,040
好吧 這樣行不行? 屁股 臉 陰道
Good call. How about this? Butt, face, puss.

1992
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,300
這才是我該去的地方
That's where I should be.

1993
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,460
我們在談論哪... 這主意不錯
I'm talking about a way where... That's good.

1994
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,540
如果我們換位置她就會忘了誰在哪
If we're switching positions, she'll lose track of who's where.

1995
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,100
- 就像賭博 - 三張牌的賭博
- Like the shell game. - Three-card Monte. Exactly.

1996
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,820
我可以埋胸然後打她屁股
I can motorboat her boobies and then smack on her butt.

1997
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,500
只要不是低俗可恥的方式就行
So long as nothing is done in a cheap or degrading way.

1998
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,140
- 我們會像菲爾醫生一樣敏感 - 我不知道我能不能上她
- We'll be as sensitive as Dr. Phil. - I don't know if I can fuck this woman.

1999
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,720
想想你的老婆孩子們
Think about your wife and girls.

2000
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,700
想想我的孩子們 我可以做到的
I'll think about my girls. I can get it done.

2001
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,180
好了嗎?
All right?

2002
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,420
- 史黛西 - 哦 不
- Stacy. - Oh, no.

2003
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,540
- 你怎麼找到我的? - 來這裡多會兒了?
- How did you find me? - Been there a while?

2004
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,500
手機定位
Find My iPhone.

2005
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,300
- 我知道你是騙我的 - 不 我不是
- I knew you were cheating on me. - No, I'm not.

2006
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,180
- 他不是 我們正準備去蹲監獄 - 監獄?
- He's not. We're trying to stay out of prison. - Prison?

2007
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,540
沒有人會進監獄的
No one's going to prison.

2008
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,660
- 因為我們綁架了一個人 - 綁架?
- Because we were gonna kidnap someone. - Kidnapping?

2009
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,300
- 不 首先 那個人是綁架了他自己 - 對
- No. First, the man kidnapped himself. - That's right.

2010
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,460
- 他逼我們... - 黛爾 甚至不操逼
- He forced us... - Dale wouldn't even do puss.

2011
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,340
- 我從沒想過操逼 - 我兩次都選的屁股
- I didn't even wanna do the puss. - I chose ass both times.

2012
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,410
我說那會讓我最有罪惡感
I said puss will make me the most guilty.

2013
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:52,220
你們沒在幫我! 閉嘴!
You're not helping me! Shut up!

2014
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,340
你看 這事太傻逼了 寶貝兒
Look, this is such a stupid thing, honey.

2015
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,980
而且放輕鬆 這裡還沒發生過性交
And easy, and nothing sexual is even happening here.

2016
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,100
來吧 黛爾 小妹妹不會把你吃了的
Come on, Dale, this pussy isn't gonna eat itself.

2017
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,380
- 朱莉亞? - 史黛西
- Julia? - Stacy.

2018
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,780
還有孩子們
And the babies.

2019
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,980
看這些孩子們 黛爾  她們和你好像
Look at those babies. Oh, Dale, they look just like you.

2020
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,700
- 聽著 - 你有病
- Listen to me. - You are sick.

2021
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,140
我沒病 別這樣 可以讓我...?
I'm not sick. Please. Can I just...?

2022
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,500
別跟著我 別跟著我
Do not follow me. Do not follow me.

2023
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,020
你這個小婊子
You fucking bitch.

2024
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,350
對不起 沒想到會這樣
Sorry. Really didn't mean for that to happen.

2025
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,940
好了 朱莉亞 你想性交嗎?
Okay, Julia. You wanna fuck?

2026
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,300
是啊
Yeah.

2027
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,380
為什麼不呢 是嗎? 我的婚姻已經結束了 它完全被毀了
Why not, right? My marriage is over. It's basically ruined.

2028
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,740
所以我毀了你的陰道怎麼樣? 這聽起來好嗎?
So how about I ruin that pussy? That sound good?

2029
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,540
- 不不不 你是負責臉 - 我是陰道
- No, no, no. You're face. - I'm puss.

2030
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,740
- 耶 - 不不不 這都是我的
- Yeah. - No, no, no. This one's all mine.

2031
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,100
什麼?
What?

2032
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,500
- 來吧 我們洗澡的時候來一發 - 太好了
- Let's do it. Let's do it in the shower. - Attaboy.

2033
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,020
你想這樣嗎? 那裡潮濕又美好
Is that what you want? Nice and wet in here.

2034
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,740
- 我無法拯救我的婚姻了 - 是的 你不能
- I can't save my marriage from prison. - No, you can't.

2035
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,620
- 幹得漂亮 黛爾 - 開始行動吧
- Great, Dale. - Let's roll.

2036
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,460
- 我們失去了聯繫 - 靠
- We lost the wire. - Shit.

2037
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,660
我們要開輛便車進去嗎?
Should we send in an unmarked?

2038
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,020
我們不能冒險 我們就守在這
We can't risk it. We'll hold here.

2039
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,100
你好 你好嗎
Hello. Howdy-do.

2040
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,700
- 你走這邊 - 停
- You go on this side. - Stop.

2041
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,260
嘿
Hey.

2042
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,700
這是什麼鬼東西?
What the fuck is this?

2043
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,480
我不需要和你爭辯
I do not need that sass-mouth.

2044
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,660
我要的是那袋現金 現在 把它拿過來
What I need is that sack of cash. Now, get it over here.

2045
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,820
別把它扔給我 滑過來 再來一次
Don't you throw it at me. You slide it. Do it again.

2046
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,780
- 不 就放到這吧 - 檢查一下
- No, we'll keep it here. - Check it.

2047
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,820
- 我的天 - 看那裡
- Holy shit. - Lookie there.

2048
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,980
- 我們做到了 - 真是個好包
- We did it. - There's a pretty bag.

2049
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,550
好 好吧 嘿
Okay. All right. Hey.

2050
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:41,140
我還要那個黏在凳子上被你拿走的手機
I'll also take that phone you took from the bottom of that bench.

2051
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,500
什麼?
What?

2052
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,660
- 手機 把手機給我 - 把手機給他
- The cell phone. Give me the cell phone. - Throw the phone to him.

2053
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,580
現在把你花俏的外套和領帶給我
Now that fancy jacket and that snappy tie.

2054
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,580
- 脫掉拿過來 - 不要
- Get them off. Get them over. - No.

2055
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,340
- 他說"不" - 我認為他是這麼說的
- He say "no"? - I think he said no.

2056
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,500
但是我們拿到這個了
But we got this.

2057
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,460
不要逼我用這個六髮式手槍
Don't make me use this six-shooter.

2058
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,460
男人手裡有槍
Man's got a shooter.

2059
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,340
你讓我感到噁心
You make me sick.

2060
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,460
美國的病根就在你這種人身上 每個人都想得到施捨
You're what's wrong with America. Everyone just wants a handout.

2061
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,860
拿去吧 拿去吧 從老老實實賺錢的人們身上拿去吧
Take, take, take from the people who earn their money honestly.

2062
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,860
好吧 我們現在不聊了 男人手裡真的有槍
All right, let's not chitchat now. The man does have a gun.

2063
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:10,780
你真會說話 但我能一槍斃了你
You got a real lip on you. I will shoot you in the chest.

2064
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,940
好吧 來吧 斃了我吧
Well, go ahead. Shoot me.

2065
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,420
你壓根就沒種
You don't have the balls.

2066
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,420
他有的 他的種可大著呢
Yeah, he does. He got big old balls.

2067
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,580
大嘴巴一個 再沒其他能力了
Big mouth. Nothing behind it.

2068
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,460
- 伙伴 - 我的天啊
- Dude. - Oh, my God.

2069
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,860
- 搞毛啊 - 我的天啊
- What the fuck? - Oh, my God.

2070
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,100
你做了什麼
What did you do?

2071
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,660
- 你斃了他 - 我沒有
- You shot him. - No, I didn't.

2072
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,940
- 你斃了他 - 手槍不應該是負荷的
- You did. - That was not supposed to be loaded.

2073
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,220
- 你什麼意思 - 這不是我的錯
- What do you mean? - That's not my fault.

2074
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,540
- 我的天啊 - 等一下...
- Oh, my God. - Wait, hold...

2075
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:46,220
伙伴 你們開始互相譴責的時候
Man. You should've seen your faces right now...

2076
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,060
應該看看自己的臉
when you started blaming each other.

2077
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,740
怎麼了
What's happening right now?

2078
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,820
我利用了你們
I'm fucking you over.

2079
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,420
不會的 我們是朋友啊
No, no. But we're all friends now.

2080
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,740
是啊 但這是多麼大的一個轉折 不是嗎
We are, but what a great twist, right?

2081
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,860
我最初想要拿走全部的錢 再栽贓給你們幾個
At first I was just gonna take all the money and throw you guys under the bus.

2082
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,380
但是我想 得了吧
I mean, come on. Duh.

2083
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,860
但是當老爸叫了警察後 證明他根本不關心我
But then when Dad called the cops and proved he doesn't give a fuck about me...

2084
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,660
我才意識到 既然我能繼承他的財產
I realized, why take a few of his millions...

2085
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,860
你們也能替我頂罪 我為什麼還要拿走他幾百萬中的一小部分
when I can inherit all of them and you guys can take the fall?

2086
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,860
過一會 警察就會來
In minutes, the police will be down here

2087
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,340
發現是你們殺了我可憐的爸爸
and discover that you killed my poor father...

2088
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,180
用的是你綁架我時從我房間偷來的槍
with a gun you stole from my room when you abducted me.

2089
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,900
那是假話
That is a lie!

2090
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,980
- 他知道 - 他知道的
- He knows. - He knows. He knows.

2091
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,860
別擔心 伙伴們
Don't worry, guys.

2092
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,780
我來解決
I'll take it from here.

2093
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,630
抱歉 雷克斯
Sorry, Rex.

2094
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,940
我們錄下證據了
But we got you.

2095
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,180
既然我能繼承他所有的財產
Why take a few of his millions...

2096
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,900
又能栽贓給你們幾個 為何還要在乎他區區幾百萬
when I can inherit all of them and you guys can take the fall?

2097
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,740
噢 將你一技 賤人
Ooh. Checkmate, bitch.

2098
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,100
- 好吧 給我吧 - 好吧 好吧
- All right, here. Let's have that. - Yeah. Yeah.

2099
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,300
- 不 我...好吧 抱歉 - 謝謝 伙伴
- No, I... Right. Sorry. - Thanks, man.

2100
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,500
不想多拿幾分鐘嗎
Didn't wanna hold onto that for two more minutes?

2101
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,620
不用 那是別人送的禮物
No, that was a gift.

2102
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,060
- 你把普銳斯停在後巷了嗎 - 停了
- Did you park the Prius in the back alley? - I sure did.

2103
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,380
- 你有鑰匙嗎 - 這裡
- Do you have the keys? - Here you go.

2104
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,060
我真為你們驕傲
I'm really proud of you guys.

2105
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,890
說真的 你們像一個隊伍一樣團結
Seriously. You pulled together. You worked like a team.

2106
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,100
和我們計劃的一樣
Just like we planned.

2107
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,420
黛爾 我們開了很多玩笑
Dale, we had a lot of laughs.

2108
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,190
我很感激 你使我感到高興
I really appreciate it. I mean, you made me smile.

2109
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,470
尼克 我想讓你更搞笑
Nick, I want you to smile more.

2110
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:20,100
知道嗎 看你眉頭皺的
You know? Look at those frown lines.

2111
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,780
休個假放鬆放鬆
Take a vacation. Lighten up.

2112
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,140
- 庫爾特 我覺得我可能最想你了 - 為什麼
- Kurt, I think I'm gonna miss you the most. - Why?

2113
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,980
好吧
Okay.

2114
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,260
拜拜
Bye.

2115
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,500
接著
Catch.

2116
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,820
- 別... - 我的天啊
- Don't... - Goddamn it.

2117
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,670
抱歉 我剛好接住了 我去 等一下
Sorry. I just have good hands. Fuck. Hang on a second.

2118
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,140
站住 站住
Hey, freeze. Freeze.

2119
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:39,180
黛爾 得了吧 你覺得我會給你一個負荷的槍
Dale, come on. You think I'd give you a loaded gun?

2120
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,700
我去
Shit.

2121
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,020
我要走了 我要去倉庫等著被警察營救 再見
I gotta get going. Gotta wait to be saved at the warehouse by the cops. See you.

2122
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,660
我去 好好跟警察談 你全身都是你爸爸的血
Oh, shit. Good luck talking to the cops. You have your dad's blood all over... Oh!

2123
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,310
我們就不能給自己留點話嗎
Can we not keep anything to ourselves?

2124
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,500
我去 抱歉
Fuck me. I'm so sorry.

2125
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,790
這比我做的還糟 我做了些什麼
That's worse than what I did. What did I do?

2126
01:32:57,790 --> 01:32:59,860
你是他的朋友 你把他介紹給我
You're friends with him. You introduced me.

2127
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,940
我們不會害怕你那個沒子彈的槍 雷克斯 你個白痴
We're not gonna be afraid of an unloaded gun, Rex, you dipshit.

2128
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,970
他有子彈 他有子彈
He's got bullets. He's got bullets.

2129
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,740
他有子彈 哇靠
He's got bullets? Fucking hell.

2130
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,780
庫爾特 你多大腰圍 32嗎
Kurt, what are you? A 32 waist?

2131
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,500
- 哇靠 他要強姦我們 - 不會
- Oh, dear God. He's gonna rape us. - No.

2132
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,220
- 你剛想要我... - 他只是想要褲子
- Oh, you just want my... - He just wants the pants.

2133
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,160
你們就出些餿主意
All-time shittiest idea you guys ever had.

2134
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,700
真不敢相信你們說服我趟這趟渾水
Can't believe you talked me into this.

2135
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,020
- 這個人已經死了 - 我知道
- This guy's dead now. - I know that.

2136
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,180
- 他死了 - 我們就應該繼續做齒輪
- He's dead. - We should've stayed cogs.

2137
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,140
這他媽的要耗太久
This is taking too damn long.

2138
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,060
我擦
Shit.

2139
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,660
這不是袋子的問題
This isn't about the bag.

2140
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,660
這是個該死的陷阱
This is the goddamn drop.

2141
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,900
進去 現在所有人都進去
Move in. Everybody move in now.

2142
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,570
脫下那條有血跡的褲子
Take off the incriminating pants.

2143
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:47,020
難道我要穿著內褲跑嗎
Run around in my underwear?

2144
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,540
為什麼不扔到車箱裡 我們可是有五百萬
Why not throw the body in the trunk? We got 5 million bucks.

2145
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,820
到處都是警察 我們哪都去不了
There's police everywhere. We're not gonna get away.

2146
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,950
該死
Oh, shit.

2147
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,420
- 拿上袋子 趕緊上車 - 為什麼
- Grab the bag. Get the fuck in. - Why?

2148
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,270
在你們那小子到倉庫前 我們要把警察引過去
Lead the cops to that warehouse before your boy gets there.

2149
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,430
如果他們看到他自由走動 他們可能就會相信你們 走吧
If they see him out walking free, they just might believe your ass. Let's go.

2150
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,460
拿上錢
Get the money.

2151
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,900
嘿 黑 伙伴們
Hey. Hey, guys.

2152
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,100
哇靠 是這群混蛋
Goddamn it. It's those idiots.

2153
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:33,340
我知道我從為說過關於綁架的事情
I knew I never said anything about kidnapping.

2154
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,820
來吧 我們走吧
Come on. Let's go.

2155
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:37,180
跟蹤我們已經是他們計劃的一部分
Following us is already a part of their plan.

2156
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,360
你根本不知道 只是確認一下
You never know. Wanna make sure.

2157
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,540
誰繫上安全帶了
What is the seat-belt situation?

2158
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,420
- 我繫上了 - 我們需要繫上
- I got mine. - We should put them on.

2159
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,060
- 我能跟你系一個嗎 - 抓住儀錶盤
- Can I get under yours? - Hold on to the dashboard.

2160
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,540
- 我擦 - 這條路不對
- Shit. - This is the wrong way.

2161
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,220
這條路不對 掉頭 趕緊停車
This is the wrong way. Turn around. Stop the car.

2162
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,860
- 你在跟誰發簡訊 - 我女朋友
- Who you texting? - My lady.

2163
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:57,180
- 放下 - 如果我不讓她知道 她會發瘋的
- Put it down. - If I don't check in, she goes crazy.

2164
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,090
順便問一下
By the way,

2165
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:06,220
你們一開始在那個車庫裡搞什麼呢
what the hell were you doing back there in that garage in the first place?

2166
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,140
那是什麼
What's that, now?

2167
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,620
- 哇靠 - 怎麼了
- Holy shit. - What's going on?

2168
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,020
你在那裡偷贖金
You were down there to steal the ransom money.

2169
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,700
聽著 我是去搶的 不是偷的
Listen, I hustle, I don't steal.

2170
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,540
你說些什麼 你在車庫裡做什麼
What the fuck does that...? What were you doing in the garage?

2171
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,900
我在想那是個機會
I was thinking there was a chance...

2172
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,740
你們拿不到錢 情況越來越糟 而且那個人會殺了你們三個
the drop might go south, and that guy would kill y'all.

2173
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,860
在那個情況 你們應該讓我拿錢而不是他
And in such a scenario, you'd rather me have the cash than him.

2174
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,540
- 他在賭我們辦不到 - 你個混蛋
- He was betting against us. - You motherfucker.

2175
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,340
- 我只是對你們即將面臨的死亡表示尊重 - 尊重我們
- I was honoring your potential death. - Honoring us?

2176
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,540
我們是什麼 日本武士
What are we, samurai?

2177
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,700
等一下 喂 是火車
Wait, hold on. Oh, hey. Train.

2178
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,940
- 有火車 有火車 - 有火車
- Train! Train! Train! - Train!

2179
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,060
- 漂亮 喔喔 - 該死
- Nice! Woo-hoo! - Damn it.

2180
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,780
你就是這麼擺脫警察的
That's how you lose the cops.

2181
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,790
- 我們不應該擺脫警察 - 不要擺脫警察
- We're not supposed to lose the cops. - Don't lose the cops.

2182
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,940
這是整個主意
That's the whole idea.

2183
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,460
- 好想法 - 現在回去 就更好了
- It was a good thought. - Going back. This is great.

2184
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,940
我希望你開慢點 你就不會犯錯了
I wish you'd slow down. You wouldn't make mistakes.

2185
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,740
別批評他了 他已經做到最好了
Don't criticize the man. He's doing the best he can.

2186
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,140
到了 我會讓他們知道的 等一下
Here, I'll let them know. Hold on.

2187
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,980
嘿 我們回來了 我們會在這
Hey. We're back. We'll stay here...

2188
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,340
直到火車走了
till all this shit goes by.

2189
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,820
然後我們一起走
Then we'll all roll.

2190
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,980
這幾個傻蛋在幹什麼
What the fuck are these assholes doing?

2191
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,260
- 他們懂了 - 應該是
- They get that? - Yeah, I think so.

2192
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,780
- 你車上載的是什麼啊 - 那是什麼
- What's that you're carrying around? - What is that?

2193
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,260
是給我的小貓的
It's for my kitties.

2194
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,860
- 你還有小貓 - 驚奇吧
- You got kittens? - Surprising.

2195
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,860
- 我不能有小貓嗎 - 你為什麼總是指責一切
- I can't have kittens? - Why you always jumping on everything?

2196
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,100
- 你帶著貓架到處跑很奇怪的 - 我喜歡小貓
- It's weird you're hauling around a cat stand. - I love pussy.

2197
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,220
- 嘿 我能下車撒尿嗎 - 不行 我們現在在飛車追逐
- Hey, can I hop out and piss? - No. We're in a car chase.

2198
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,530
超級長的火車 我可以尿完的
Super long train. I feel I could get it done.

2199
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:36,780
車上這麼多貨物
It is a lot of freight.

2200
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,260
堅持下去
Hold the line

2201
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,420
可能需要...
It probably needs...

2202
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,860
愛不總是能即使到達
Love isn't always on time

2203
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,740
堅持 堅持
Hold the line

2204
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,540
這也太容易了
It's just too goddamn easy.

2205
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,200
我感覺我現在可以去尿了
I feel like I could have pissed by now.

2206
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:39,380
讓他去 開門
Let him go. Open the door.

2207
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,420
- 還有一節車 - 該死

2208
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,420
該死 條子
Oh, shit. Cops.

2209
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,230
- 條子 條子 - 該死
- Cops. Cops. - Shit.

2210
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,740
- 怎麼了 - 你丟了東西
- What happened? - You lost your stuff.

2211
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,180
- 什麼 該死 - 是的 你丟了你的貓架
- What? Damn it. - Yeah, you lost your cat stuff.

2212
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,820
好了 這有個人 當心他
Okay, there's a man there. Watch out for him.

2213
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,060
嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2214
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,980
- 我們困在裡面了 - 不會太久
- Hey, we're boxed in here. - Not for long.

2215
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,900
- 不要 不要 - 我一直想這麼做了
- No, no, no. - I've always wanted to do this.

2216
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,460
最後再來一次
Gotta make it last

2217
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,420
我輕撫你一次
I touch you once

2218
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,700
我輕撫你兩次
I touch you twice

2219
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,260
該死
Shit.

2220
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,900
幹嘛
What?

2221
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,140
這是哪
So where is this place?

2222
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:59,540
快到了 橋下面
It's up here. Under the bridge.

2223
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,180
- 你在幹什麼 - 你應該在橋下走
- What are you doing? - You're supposed to go under the bridge.

2224
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,300
放鬆
Relax.

2225
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,460
- 輪子被卡住了 - 踩煞車器
- The wheels are locked. - Pump the brakes.

2226
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,100
- 換擋 - 停車
- Shift down. - Put it in park.

2227
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,340
我沒辦法思考
I can't think.

2228
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,340
我賭你們現在一定愛死這個圍欄了
Bet y'all loving this fence now.

2229
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,140
我已經從這些圍欄中恢復意識了
I've come around to the whole fence thing.

2230
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,300
我也愛死安全帶了
I would've loved a seat belt too.

2231
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,980
好吧 下一步計劃是什麼 蠢貨
Well, what's the next part of the plan, Motherfucker?

2232

- 那個蠢蛋在哪 - 我不知道
- Where's Motherfucker? - I don't know.

2237
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,860
條子 條子
Cops. Cops.

2238
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,660

01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,620
- 舉起手來 - 放鬆 把槍放地上
- Hands up. - Relax. Please, put your guns down.

2241
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,020
我們沒有殺任何人 我向老天發誓
We didn't kill anybody. I swear to God.

2242
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,190
我不吃這套 跟法官說這些吧
I don't give a goddamn. Tell it to the judge.

2243
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,620
我們沒有綁架任何人
We didn't kidnap anybody.

2244
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,100
他綁架了他自己 他隨時都會溜進來
He kidnapped himself. He'll sneak in any second.

2245
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,380
- 他本應該捆在椅子上的 - 他在你後面
- He was supposed to be tied up to that chair. - Right behind you.

2246
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:41,820
誰 他
Who? Him?

2247
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,820
是的
Yeah.

2248
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,780
啊哦 完蛋了 完大蛋了
Aw, that looks bad. That looks bad.

2249
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,260
- 這個該死貨 - 你應該相信我們
- This fucking guy. - You gotta believe us.

2250
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:52,260
是他們 他們三個拷打我 他們說他們要殺了我爸爸
That's them. Those three, they tortured me, then said they were gonna kill my dad.

2251
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,620
- 別聽他胡說 - 就在車庫
- Oh, don't listen to that. - That's garbage.

2252
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,500
告訴我他沒事
Tell me he's okay. Please.

2253
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,020
- 我很抱歉 孩子 - 不

2254
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,460
- 不 - 他殺了他爸爸啊

2255
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,260
- 他真是演技派 厲害 - 不要相信他
- He's a very strong actor. Bravo. - Don't buy it.

2256
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,260
- 趴下 - 我們這就趴下
- Get on the ground. - We're getting down.

2257
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,270
難以置信你相信了他的演技
I can't believe you're buying that acting.

2258
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:11,900
他演得的確很逼真 但是
I mean, it's good, but...

2259
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,420
你有權利保持沉默 蠢貨們
You have the right to remain silent, assholes.

2260
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,860
你也有權利請律師 你們有
You have the right to an attorney, asshole. You have...

2261

嘿 嘿 那是我的手機 他手上有我的手機
Hey. Hey, that's my phone. He has my phone.

2262

- 那是伯特在長凳瞎買年拿的電話 - 檢查一下
- The phone Bert had on the bench. - Check that phone.

2263
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,820
如果他一直被捆在這裡
If he was tied up here the whole time,

2264
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:30,860
雷克斯怎麼拿到他的手機的
how could Rex have the same phone?

2265
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,260
- 他們換了褲子 - 是的 他們明白了
- They switched pants! - Yeah. They got it.

2266
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,420
- 檢查一下 - 只是同一個鈴聲 長官
- Check it. - It's the same ringtone, sir.

2267
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,780
是的 那是我的手機
Yeah. That's my phone.

2268
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,630
我有相同的鈴聲 這是個振奮人心的鈴聲
I have the same ringtone. It's an inspiring ringtone.

2269
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,180
你一直待在這裡 還帶著手機
You were here this whole time with a cell phone...

2270
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,220
但是卻沒有打給警察
and didn't bother to call the police?

2271
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,420
- 是的 - 閉上你們的狗嘴
- Yes. - Shut the fuck up.

2272
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,780
讓我看看
Let me see it.

2273
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,980
我說了 讓我看看
I said let me see it.

2274
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,180
好的
Okay.

2275
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,210
大家都退後
Everybody move the fuck off.

2276
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:01,340
他現在看起來有罪了 對吧
Yeah, he looks pretty guilty now, right?

2277
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,660
他絕對是嫌疑犯
He's definitely suspect.

2278
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,140
扔掉你們的槍
Drop your fucking guns.

2279
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,980
對這個混蛋開槍 趕緊對他開槍
You shoot this prick. You shoot this prick right now.

2280
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,660
扔下槍 不然我就打爆他的頭 聽到沒 快點
You drop your guns or I'll blow his fucking head off. You hear me? Move.

2281
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,020
快點
Move.

2282
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,340
他準備就這樣逃跑
He's gonna get away with this.

2283
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,980
- 這傢伙不會停下 - 他真是堅韌不拔
- This guy doesn't quit. - He's incredibly resilient.

2284
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,180
- 你 車裡有鑰匙嗎 - 有
- You. Keys in the car? - Keys are in the car.

2285
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,460
- 這個賤人 - 冷靜
- This fucking guy. - Calm down.

2286
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,900
這個賤人都是學我的 "冷靜 黛爾" 不
This fucking guy took everything from me. "Calm down, Dale"? No.

2287
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,020
- 這個賤人去死吧 他害我失去妻子 - 好吧 走開
- Fuck this fucking guy. He took my wife. - All right, step away.

2288
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,390
還害我失去了孩子 我要做點什麼
He took my kids. I'm gonna do something.

2289
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,660
冷靜 你要做什麼
Easy. What are you gonna do?

2290
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,350
看看誰現在才是掠奪者
Look who's the predator now, bitch.

2291
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:38,060
等一下 黛爾 你要幹什麼
Wait, Dale. What are you doing?

2292
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,430
- 黛爾 - 我中槍了
- Dale. - Oh, I'm shot.

2293
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,580
過去 抓住他
Get in there. Get him.

2294
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,340
銬住這個瘋子 順便在痛扁他一頓
Cuff this crazy asshole. And beat the shit out of him while you're at it.

2295
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,420
- 噢 該死 - 黛爾 伙伴 你還好嗎 喂
- Oh, shit. - Dale, buddy, you okay? Hey.

2296
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,620
- 我的天啊 - 喔噢
- Oh, my God. - Oh, wow.

2297
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,340
- 該死 - 你剛剛在幹嘛
- Oh, shit. - What was that?

2298
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,180
黛爾 放下這個 你這到底是什麼計劃 伙伴
Dale, let's put this down. What was the plan here, buddy?

2299
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,250
我反應過度了 這一點都不鋒利
I overreacted. It's not even sharp.

2300
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,540
腎上腺激素分泌過度
Adrenaline.

2301
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,020
是不是只是擦傷 還是
Did it just graze me, or...?

2302
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:09,060
不是 你被子彈正中胸膛
No, you got hit right in the square of the fucking chest.

2303
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,300
- 到身體裡去了 - 你會沒事的
- Went straight through. - You're gonna be fine.

2304
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,820
我不知道 流了好多血
No, I don't know about that. That's a lot of blood.

2305
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,300
- 不要聽他說的 你會挺過去的 - 該死
- Don't listen to him. You're gonna make it. - Fuck.

2306
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,380
嘿 如果你還想要希望 聽他的吧
Hey, if you want hope, listen to him.

2307
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,630
如果你要聽真相
If you want the truth,

2308
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:21,940
我是你的伙伴 對嗎 這是個壞消息
I'm your fucking guy, all right? This is bad news.

2309
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,540
能不能幫幫我們
Can we get some help here?

2310
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,660
別擔心 我們會讓你沒事的
Don't worry. We're gonna get you fixed up.

2311
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,020
- 噢 我的耶穌啊 - 不好嗎 不好嗎
- Oh, Jesus Christ. - Is it bad? Is it bad?

2312
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,860
- 這他媽是個大洞 - 是的
- That's a big fucking hole. - Yeah.

2313
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:33,540
- 我就要死在這了 - 如果你要走 就走吧
- I'm gonna go to this light right here. - If you've gotta go, you gotta go.

2314
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,400
請別讓我在他說話中死去
Please don't let me die with him talking.

2315
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,300
我會照顧史黛西和你的孩子們
I'll take care of Stacy and your boys.

2316
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,220
沒有比這更煩的了
That couldn't be more annoying.

2317
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,860
我已經在努力不那麼煩了
I'm not trying to be annoying.

2318
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,860
- 我在儘量弄得又去 - 那很煩人
- I'm trying to have fun. - It's annoying.

2319
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:53,060
- 但是有用了 看看 - 看看誰在說話 你還好嗎
- It worked though. Look at that. - Look who's talking. You okay?

2320
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,980
你在生死邊緣徘徊 現在又說話了真好
You've been drifting in and out. Nice to hear you talking.

2321
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,220
- 那麼 醫生怎麼說的 我會死嗎
So, what do the doctors say? Am I gonna die?

2322
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,580
- 是的 - 什麼
- Yes. - Yes?

2323
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,620
- 不會 - 我們都會死的
- No. - We're all gonna die.

2324
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,100
這很危險的 但是你沒事了
It's been touch-and-go, but you're gonna be fine.

2325
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,620
醫生會讓你出院的
Doctors are gonna let you out.

2326
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,380
- 很好 - 他們的確給了你鳥的心臟
- That's good. - They did have to give you a bird's heart.

2327
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,900
- 天啊 - 你還適應嗎
- Oh, God. - You okay with that?

2328
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,220
- 沒有 - 他在開玩笑
- No. - He's kidding.

2329
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:12,420
我們在開玩笑
We're kidding.

2330
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,020
那個心臟對我可能太老了
That heart would've been too old for me.

2331
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,180
我昏迷了多久
How long was I out?

2332
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:16,660
- 兩年 - 真的嗎
- Two years. - Really?

2333
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,020
- 四天 - 那好多了
- Four days. - That's better.

2334
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:20,820
你為什麼不玩了 反正我們已經說了兩年
Why didn't you play? Thought we were gonna say two years.

2335
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,420
我們現在有了女總統
We've got a woman president.

2336
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,260
該死
Shit.

2337
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,460
- 看看誰來了 - 我的天啊 他在說話
- Look who's here. - Oh, my gosh. He's talking.

2338
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,820
- 嗨 你在說話 - 我們不打擾你們了
- You're talking. Hi. - We'll leave you alone.

2339
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,380
拜託 讓我來給你解釋一切
Please. Let me explain everything to you,

2340
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:33,900
裡面有太多誤會了
there are so many misunderstandings.

2341
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,980
- 沒事 朱莉亞解釋了一切 - 不要跟她說話 她瘋了
- It's okay. Julia explained everything. - Don't talk to her. She's crazy.

2342
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:41,380
她告訴了我由於她的苦難把你捲入了這一切
She told me everything she put you through because of her affliction.

2343
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,860
"她的苦難"
"Her affliction"?

2344
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,020
她當時有心臟病
It's heartbreaking what she's been through.

2345
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,580
- 嗨 - 她還跟我說了我丈夫
- Hi. - She also told me that my husband...

2346
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:50,460
是唯一抵制她的誘惑的人
is the only one that ever resisted her.

2347
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,940
- 好吧 - 黛爾 你真是個幸運的男人
- Okay. - Dale, you are one lucky man.

2348
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,700
你太太真是善解人意 體貼入微
Your wife is so understanding and caring.

2349
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,740

She has been so supportive with the babies. And helpful.

噢 拜託 這是我唯一能作為賠罪的
Oh. Please, it's the least I can do to make amends for my bad behavior.

2352
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,140
好吧
Okay.

2353
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,580
我會找到麥克醫生 告訴他能說話了
I'm gonna find Dr. Mike, tell him you're talking.

2354
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:13,300
好的 很好 去找醫生 因為我感覺有點
Okay, good. Go get the doctor because I'm feeling a little...

2355
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:14,780
你來這裡幹什麼
What is going on here?

2356
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,780
怎麼了 我擺脫你了 沒有什麼大白鯨交易 或者其他的
What's up? I'm off the hook? No more white-whale business? Or any of that?

2357
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,500
- 沒有了 你已經擺脫我了 - 真的嗎
- No more. You're off the hook. - Really?

2358
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:27,260
你知道男人在昏迷中仍然可以勃起嗎
Did you know that when men are in a coma they can still get an erection?

2359
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,980
真的哦 黛爾 昏迷勃起者
It's true, Dale. Coma boners.

2360
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,940
"昏迷勃起者" 什麼啊
"Coma boner"? What?

2361
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,220
昏迷中勃起很多很多次
Lots and lots of coma boners.

2362
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,340
想想吧
Think about it.

2363
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,460
- 該死 - 好吧 好吧 我還是走吧
- Oh, shit. - All right, well, I better go.

2364
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:44,180
我為我和史黛西預約了溫泉理療
I'm booking a spa day for me and Stacy.

2365
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,500
- 我會幹你的老婆 黛爾 - 不要 不要
- I'm gonna fuck your wife, Dale. - No, no.

2366
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,900
不要 不要 等一下 不要
No. No, you're not. Hang on. Hang on. No.

2367
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,060
- 嘿 他在這 - 孩子們

你看起來真美 你知道
You look fantastic. You know,

2369
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:59,500
我給你發了很多簡訊都沒有收到回復
I've been sending you a lot of unanswered texts.

2370
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,520
你不是這麼吸引他們的
That's not how you catch them.

2371
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,300
我覺得她要去幹我老婆
I think she said she's gonna fuck my wife.

2372
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,300
- 其實她已經幹了 - 如脫韁的馬無法挽回了
- Thought she already did. - That horse may have left the barn.

2373
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,500
我感覺她們倆已經基情四射了
I figured those guys have been bumping tacos.

2374
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,990
她們最近非常親密
Super touchy-feely lately.

2375
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,780
我不能讓它發生 太過分了
I can't process this. This is too much.

2376
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,140
那麼 最後怎麼樣了
Anyway, so, what's even going on?

2377
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,480
我們有沒有跟警察搞出什麼麻煩
Did we get in trouble with the police, or...?

2378
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,140
有麻煩
We did, yeah.

2379
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,070
- 是的 很多麻煩 - 我們因為一長串重罪被捕
- Yeah. A lot. - We got arrested for a long list of felonies.

2380
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,090
但是因為你替探長挨了槍
But because you took a bullet for the detective,

2381
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:25,740
地方檢察官給我們赦免了很多
 DA got rid of the biggies.

2382
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,150
減免費用了嗎 很好
Dropped some charges? Nice.

2383
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,900

2384
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:28,900
我覺得你有點像凱文·科斯特納
You're like a little Kevin Costner.

2385
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,300
你是我們的守衛者
You're our bodyguard.

2386
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:33,500
說的好聽 好吧 看來我們保住了我們的生意
Pretty sweet. All right, so I'm guessing we saved the business.

2387
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,110
- 沒有 - 沒保住
- Nope. We did not. - We did not.

2388
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,140

Going once, going twice, sold. To D.H. Commercial Trust.

2390
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,570
但也有個好消息
But there's good news.

2391
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,060
買我們公司的人讓我們繼續運營
The guy who bought the company is keeping us on to run it.

2392
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,160

If we bring that down to $300, you've got...

2393
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,220

Yes. Let's go show him these great numbers too.

2399
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,780
我們應該為這些數字高興嗎
Are we happy with these numbers?

2400
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,940
這很不錯的
They're pretty good.

2401
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,020
- 還有提高的空間 - 我們還能做得更好

2402
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,300
