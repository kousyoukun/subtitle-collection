1
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,271
"America has heard the bugle call

2
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:41,648
"And you know it involves us one and all

3
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:49,923
"I don't suppose that war will ever end

4
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:58,097
"There's fighting
that will break us up again

5
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,033
"Good-bye, my darling
Hello, Vietnam

6
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:14,378
"I'm here to take a battle to be won

7
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:22,792
"Kiss me good-bye
And write me while I'm gone

8
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:31,101
"Good-bye, my sweetheart
Hello, Vietnam"

9
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:39,777
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

10
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,980
You will speak only when spoken to.

11
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:46,910
The first and last words
out of your sewers will be "Sir!"

12
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:48,850
Do you maggots understand?

13
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,453
Sir, yes, sir!

14
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:53,889
I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,621
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

16
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:04,434
...you will be a weapon,
a minister of death, praying for war.

17
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,432
But until that day, you are pukes!

18
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:10,105
The lowest form of life on Earth.

19
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:12,573
You are not even human fucking beings!

20
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:17,248
You are only unorganized,
grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit!

21
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,577
Because I am hard, you won't like me.

22
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,410
The more you hate me,
the more you'll learn.

23
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,780
I am hard, but I am fair!

24
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,184
There is no racial bigotry here!

25
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,362
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

26
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:34,993
Here, you are all equally worthless!

27
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:38,096
My orders are to weed out non-hackers...

28
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:41,362
...who do not pack the gear
to be in my beloved Corps!

29
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:43,597
Do you maggots understand that?

30
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,974
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

31
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:52,739
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!

32
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,480
From now on you're Private Snowball!
Like that name?

33
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:57,918
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,480
There's one thing you won't like!

35
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,955
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

36
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:05,756
...in my mess hall!

37
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,027
Is that you, John Wayne?

38
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,293
Is this me?

39
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:11,931
Who said that?

40
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:14,331
Who the fuck said that?

41
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:18,206
Who's the slimy communist cocksucker
down here...

42
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,778
...who just signed his own death warrant?

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,708
Nobody, huh?

44
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:25,980
The fairy fucking godmother said it!

45
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:30,018
Out-fucking-standing!
I will P.T. you all until you die!

46
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:33,155
I will P.T. you until your assholes
suck buttermilk!

47
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,022
Was it you, you little fuck?

48
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:39,554
You look like a fucking worm!
I bet it was you!

49
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,066
Sir, I said it, sir!

50
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:46,427
Well, no shit.

51
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:50,166
What are you, a fucking comedian?
Private Joker.

52
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,101
I admire your honesty.

53
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:55,977
I like you. Come over to my house
and fuck my sister!

54
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:01,812
You little scumbag! I've got your name!
I've got your ass!

55
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:04,112
You will not laugh or cry!

56
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:06,790
You will learn by the number!

57
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:08,721
Get up! Get on your feet!

58
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:14,160
Unfuck yourself or I'll unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,063
- Why did you join my beloved Corps?
- Sir, to kill, sir!

60
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,536
You're a killer!

61
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,801
Let me see your war face!

62
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:25,167
You've got a war face?

63
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:29,406
That's a war face! Let me see yours!

64
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:34,207
You didn't convince me!
Let me see your real war face!

65
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:38,146
You don't scare me! Work on it!

66
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,322
What's your excuse?

67
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,826
Sir, excuse, sir?

68
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:45,886
I'm asking the fucking questions,
understand?

69
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,699
Thank you!
Can I be in charge for a while?

70
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,667
Are you shook up? Nervous?

71
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:54,032
Sir, I am, sir!

72
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:55,697
Do I make you nervous?

73
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:59,669
Were you about to call me an asshole?

74
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:03,006
- How tall are you, Private?
- Sir, 5'9", sir!

75
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:06,209
I didn't know they stacked shit that high!

76
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,909
Trying to squeeze an inch in on me, huh?

77
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:13,479
The best part of you ran down
the crack of your mama's ass...

78
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:17,392
...and ended up as a brown stain
on the mattress!

79
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:19,593
Where in hell are you from?

80
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:25,426
Holy dogshit! Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy!

81
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:28,970
You don't look like a steer,
so that narrows it down!

82
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:30,571
Suck dicks?

83
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:32,943
You a peter-puffer?

84
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,437
I bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,881
...and not have the courtesy
to give him a reach-around!

86
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:41,980
I'll be watching you!

87
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,420
Your parents have children that lived?

88
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,692
Bet they regret that!

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,558
You're so ugly
you're a modern-art masterpiece!

90
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:54,459
- What's your name, fatbody?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!

91
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,432
Lawrence, what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,265
That name sounds like royalty!
You royalty?

93
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,503
You suck dicks?

94
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:06,539
Bet you could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!

95
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:11,345
I don't like that name!
Faggots and sailors are called Lawrence!

96
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:13,550
From now on you're Gomer Pyle!

97
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:17,116
Think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
Think I'm funny?

98
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:20,320
Then wipe off that disgusting grin!

99
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,620
Any fucking time, sweetheart!

100
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,288
I'm trying, sir!

101
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:28,594
I'll give you three seconds...

102
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,928
...exactly three fucking seconds...

103
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,436
...to wipe off that stupid grin...

104
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,606
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you!

105
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:44,275
- Sir, I can't help it, sir!
- Get on your knees, scumbag!

106
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,218
Now choke yourself!

107
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:52,383
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts!

108
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:55,725
Don't pull my hand over there!

109
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:59,286
I said choke yourself!
Lean forward and choke yourself!

110
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,130
Are you through grinning?

111
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,269
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

112
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:14,236
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!
Sound off like you got a pair!

113
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,183
That's enough. Get on your feet!

114
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:26,990
Pyle, square your ass away and
start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

115
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,657
...or I will definitely fuck you up!

116
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:43,472
Parris Island, South Carolina...

117
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:46,706
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

118
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:50,906
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

119
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,913
"Mama and Papa were laying in bed!

120
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,921
"Mama rolled over
and this is what she said:

121
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,221
"Oh, give me some...

122
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,187
"...P.T.!"

123
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,930
"Good for you and good for me!

124
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,102
"Mmm, good!

125
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:16,002
"Up in the morning to the rising sun!

126
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:20,276
"Gotta run all day...

127
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:22,142
"...till the running's done!

128
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,584
"Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch!

129
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,781
"Got the blueballs, crabs
and the seven-year itch!"

130
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:56,905
Left shoulder, hut!

131
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:02,347
What are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

132
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,580
Sir, I don't know, sir!

133
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:08,615
Do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

134
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:13,392
You did that on purpose!
You want to be different!

135
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:17,096
- What side was that?
- Sir, left side, sir!

136
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,261
Are you sure, Private Pyle?

137
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:22,869
What side was that?

138
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,498
Sir, right side, sir!

139
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,073
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle!

140
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:29,142
Pick up your fucking cover!

141
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,946
Tonight, you pukes will sleep
with your rifles!

142
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,842
You will give your rifle a girl's name!

143
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:13,981
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get!

144
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:19,057
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

145
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,694
...through her pretty
pink panties are over!

146
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,859
You're married to this piece...

147
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,265
...this weapon of iron and wood!

148
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:31,137
And you will be faithful!

149
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,409
Prepare to mount!

150
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:56,925
Pray!

151
00:10:57,702 --> 00:10:59,329
"This is my rifle.

152
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:02,897
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

153

"I must fire my rifle true.

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,997
"I must shoot him before he shoots me.

161
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,256
"I will.

162
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,496
"Before God I swear this creed.

163
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:37,298
"My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

164
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,769
"We are the masters of our enemy.

165
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,308
"We are the saviors of my life.

166
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:43,873
"So be it...

167
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:46,815
"...until there is no enemy, but peace.

168
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,140
"Amen."

169
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:56,015
At ease!

170
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,085
Good night, ladies!

171
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,391
Hit it!

172
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,974
This is not your daddy's shotgun,
Cowboy!

173
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,023
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle!

174
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,297
Four inches from your chest, Pyle!

175
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:37,727
Four inches!

176
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,698
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

177
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:44,172
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun!

178
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,969
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

179
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:49,706
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun!"

180
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,101
You're bouncing!

181
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:29,446
Ten fucking seconds!

182
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,014
It should take you ten seconds
to negotiate this obstacle!

183
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,116
Quickly, move it out!

184
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:39,795
No swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

185
00:13:40,098 --> 00:13:44,125
...until they get this obstacle down
to less than ten fucking seconds!

186
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,659
Next two! Quickly!

187
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,495
Get over that goddamn obstacle!
Move it!

188
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:18,692
Private Joker, are you a killer?

189
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,265
Let me hear your war cry!

190
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,567
Get your fat ass over there!

191
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,679
That's right, Private Pyle...

192
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:33,148
...don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top!

193
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:38,245
If God wanted you up there,
He'd have miracled your ass up there!

194
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:41,250
Get your fat ass up there!

195
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,418
What the hell's wrong with you?

196
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:48,864
If there was some pussy up there,
you could get up there, couldn't you?

197
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:53,803
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum, Pyle.

198
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,803
One for the commandant!

199
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,878
One for the Corps!

200
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,510
Get up there!

201
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,739
Pull!

202
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:10,877
The Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, Pyle!

203
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,621
Pull!

204
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,447
Pull, Pyle, pull!

205
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,393
One pull-up, Pyle! Come on, pull!

206
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:20,896
You've got to be shitting me!
Get your ass up there!

207
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,924
Do you mean to tell me you cannot do
one single pull-up?

208
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,205
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle!
Get out of my face!

209
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,401
Get up there, Snowball.

210
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,507
Get up here, fatboy!

211
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,543
Quickly! Move it up, Pyle! Move it up!

212
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:42,281
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

213
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,284
Get up here! You're too slow! Move it!

214
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:49,618
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down!

215
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,887
That would break my fucking heart!

216
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:54,554
Quickly! Up and over! Up and over!

217
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:59,058
What in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

218
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:00,631
Get up and over!

219
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,502
Move it, move it!

220
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:05,137
Are you quitting on me?

221
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:07,533
Well, are you?

222
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:12,148
Then quit, you slimy, fucking,
walrus-looking piece of shit!

223
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,048
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

224
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:17,752
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

225
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:20,187
Now! Move it!

226
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:25,755
I'm going to rip your balls off so you
can't contaminate the rest of the world!

227
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,688
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

228
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:32,993
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo!

229
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,766
Pick 'em up and set 'em down, Pyle!

230
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,070
Quickly! Move it up!

231
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:44,109
Were you born a fat, slimy scumbag,
you piece of shit, Private Pyle?

232
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,443
Or did you have to work on it?

233
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:47,877
Move it up!

234
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,318
Quickly! Hustle up!

235
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:54,948
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, Private Pyle!

236
00:16:57,295 --> 00:17:01,197
Are you going to fucking die?
Are you going to die on me?

237
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,659
Do it now!

238
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,593
Move it up!

239
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,001
Hustle it up! Quickly!

240
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:09,639
Feel dizzy?

241
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,240
Faint?

242
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,980
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on!

243
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:24,280
Quickly, ladies! Assholes and elbows!
Move it out!

244
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:25,883
Get up!

245
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,274
Reveille! Reveille!

246
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:54,617
Drop your cocks and grab your socks!

247
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:57,483
Today is Sunday!
Divine worship is 0800.

248
00:17:57,822 --> 00:18:00,222
Get your bunks made
and your uniforms on.

249
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:02,689
Police call in two minutes.

250
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,495
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

251
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,467
Finish your bunks, then you two turds
clean the head.

252
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:14,036
I want that head so sanitary...

253
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,973
...that the Virgin Mary could go
in there and take a dump!

254
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:21,371
Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?

255
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,074
Sir, no, sir!

256
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:30,187
Private Joker, I don't believe
I heard you correctly!

257
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,916
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!

258
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,686
You little maggot!
You make me want to vomit!

259
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:40,557
You communist heathen, sound off
that you love the Virgin Mary...

260
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,856
...or I'll stomp your guts out!

261
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
You love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

262
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:47,068
Negative, sir!

263
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:49,868
Are you trying to offend me?

264
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,370
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong!

265
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:58,347
And that you will beat him harder
if he reverses himself, sir!

266
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,277
Who's your squad leader?

267
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:03,286
The private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir!

268
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:08,050
Private Snowball reporting, sir!

269
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,959
You're fired! Private Joker is promoted
to squad leader!

270
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:14,764
Disappear, scumbag!

271
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:19,193
Reporting as ordered, sir!

272
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,832
From now on Private Joker is your new
squad leader and you bunk with him.

273
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,335
He'll teach you!

274
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,206
He'll teach you how to pee!

275
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:31,971
Private Joker is ignorant
but he's got guts, and guts is enough.

276
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:33,944
Now you ladies carry on.

277
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,351
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

278
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,324
Operating rod handle.

279
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,629
Operating rod guide.

280
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,439
And the left one over the right.

281
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:00,371
Right one over the left.

282
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:04,676
Left one over the right.

283
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:07,212
Right one over the left.

284
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,513
Just throw your other leg over.

285
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,095
Pull the next one over
and you're home free.

286
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:35,278
Just throw it over.

287
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,487
That'a boy. Just set it down.

288
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:57,128
Congratulations, Leonard.

289
00:20:57,835 --> 00:20:58,961
You did it.

290
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,805
Fold the blanket and sheet back together.

291
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,266
Make a four-inch fold.

292
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:08,167
Got it?

293
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:09,804
You do it.

294
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:14,313
Right shoulder, hut!

295
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:21,657
Port, hut!

296
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,124
Order, hut!

297
00:21:58,195 --> 00:21:59,890
Square these weapons away.

298
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,831
The deadliest weapon in the world...

299
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:11,135
...is a Marine, and his rifle.

300
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:15,603
It is your killer instinct
that must be harnessed...

301
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:18,979
...if you expect to survive in combat.

302
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:21,612
Your rifle...

303
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,309
...is only a tool.

304
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,146
It is a hard heart that kills.

305
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,656
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

306
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:34,988
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

307
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:37,360
You will not kill.

308
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:39,735
You will become dead Marines.

309
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:43,169
And then you will be in a world of shit.

310
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:47,036
Because Marines are not allowed...

311
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:49,044
...to die without permission!

312
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:51,275
Do you maggots understand?

313
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:57,215
"I love working for Uncle Sam!

314
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:03,053
"Lets me know just who I am!

315
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,322
"One, two, three, four!
United States Marine Corps!

316
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:15,295
"One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!

317
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,902
"My Corps! Your Corps!

318
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:23,542
"Our Corps! Marine Corps!

319
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:27,214
"I don't know, but I've been told...

320
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:33,083
"...Eskimo pussy is mighty cold!

321
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,623
"Mmm, good! Feels good!

322
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:41,523
"Is good! Real good!

323
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,492
"Tastes good! Mighty good!

324
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:47,529
"Good for you! Good for me!"

325
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:51,897
Trim 'em!

326
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:56,540
Toe-jam!

327
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:01,382
Pop that blister!

328
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,222
Jesus H. Christ!

329
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,860
- Why is your footlocker unlocked?
- Sir, I don't know, sir!

330
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:22,428
If there is one thing
in this world I hate...

331
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,198
...it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, right?

332
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:31,480
Without dickheads like you,
there'd be no thievery in the world!

333
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:33,472
Get down!

334
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:40,819
Now let's just see
if there's anything missing!

335
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:45,860
Holy Jesus!

336
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:48,297
What is that?

337
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,733
What the fuck is that?

338
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:53,365
What is that, Private Pyle?

339
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,234
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!

340
00:24:57,374 --> 00:25:00,070
- Where did you get it?
- From the mess hall, sir!

341
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,742
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Pyle?

342
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:06,807
Are you allowed to eat
jelly doughnuts, Private?

343
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:11,084
- Why not, Private?
- Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!

344
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:15,214
Because you are a disgusting fatbody,
Private Pyle!

345
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:20,056
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker?

346
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,098
Because I was hungry, sir!

347
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:24,267
Because you were hungry?

348
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:30,330
Private Pyle...

349
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:34,637
...has dishonored himself
and dishonored the platoon!

350
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:38,911
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed!

351
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,643
I have failed because
you have not helped me!

352
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:46,119
You people...

353
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:50,887
...have not given Private Pyle
the proper motivation!

354
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:56,626
From now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

355
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:59,092
...I will not punish him.

356
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,700
I will punish all of you!

357
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:04,300
And the way I see it, ladies...

358
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:07,241
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut!

359
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:09,339
Get on your faces!

360
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:13,147
Open your mouth!

361
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:15,777
They're paying for it, you eat it!

362
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:18,583
Ready, exercise!

363
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:21,518
"One, two, three, four!

364
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,093
"I love the Marine Corps!"

365
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:45,372
You really look like shit today.

366
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,421
Everybody hates me now.

367
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:03,056
Even you.

368
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:08,633
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

369
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:13,401
You just keep making mistakes,
getting everybody in trouble.

370
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:19,110
I can't do anything right.

371
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:23,646
I need help.

372
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:29,416
I'm trying to help you.

373
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,394
I'm really trying.

374
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,723
Tuck your shirt in.

375
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:35,874
Do it.

376
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,430
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

377
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:40,408
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

378
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,852
Semper fi, do or die!

379
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,217
Gung ho, gung ho!

380
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:47,583
What makes the grass grow?

381
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:49,655
Blood, blood, blood.

382
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:52,487
What do we do for a living, ladies?

383
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:54,490
Kill, kill, kill!

384
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:56,188
I can't hear you!

385
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:58,095
Kill, kill, kill!

386
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:01,065
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!

387
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,166
Kill, kill, kill!

388
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:06,907
Do any of you know
who Charles Whitman was?

389
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,313
None of you dumbasses knows?

390
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:18,720
Sir, he shot all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!

391
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:21,480
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

392
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:25,517
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas...

393
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,854
...from distances of up to 400 yards.

394
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:32,231
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

395
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:36,868
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!

396
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,702
And do you know how far away he was?

397
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:43,604
Sir, it was far! From that
book suppository building, sir!

398
00:31:44,648 --> 00:31:45,876
Knock it off!

399
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,308
250 feet!

400
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:52,447
He was 250 feet away and shooting
at a moving target.

401
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:54,781
He got off three rounds...

402
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:58,191
...with an Italian bolt-action rifle
in six seconds...

403
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,557
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot!

404
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,764
Do any of you know where...

405
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,166
...these individuals learned to shoot?

406
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:11,271
Sir, in the Marines, sir!

407
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:15,275
In the Marines! Outstanding!
Those individuals...

408
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:18,643
...showed what one motivated Marine
and his rifle can do!

409
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,907
Before you ladies leave my island...

410
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:24,779
...you will all be able
to do the same thing!

411
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:29,615
"Happy birthday to you

412
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:39,030
"Happy birthday, dear Jesus"

413
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:46,633
Today...

414
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,775
...is Christmas!

415
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:53,613
There will be a magic show at 0930!

416
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:58,344
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

417
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:02,650
...about how the free world
will conquer Communism...

418
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:07,251
...with the aid of God and a few Marines!

419
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,024
God has a hard-on for Marines...

420
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:16,732
...because we kill everything we see!

421
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:19,568
He plays His games...

422
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,977
...we play ours!

423
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,407
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

424
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,580
...we keep heaven packed...

425
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:33,019
...with fresh souls!

426
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:37,827
God was here before the Marine Corps!

427
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:41,130
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

428
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:45,164
...but your ass belongs to the Corps!

429
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:47,566
Do you ladies understand?

430
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:50,764
I can't hear you!

431
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:01,083
It's been swabbed and brushed.

432
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:04,514
Everything...

433
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,116
...is clean.

434
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:12,820
Beautiful.

435
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:17,228
So that it slides perfectly.

436
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,159
Nice.

437
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,164
Everything cleaned...

438
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:27,665
...oiled.

439
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,775
So that your action is beautiful.

440
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,853
Smooth, Charlene.

441
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,811
Leonard talks to his rifle.

442
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:18,183
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.

443
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,964
I think Leonard's a Section 8.

444
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,826
It don't surprise me.

445
00:35:38,848 --> 00:35:41,442
I want to slip my tubesteak
into your sister.

446
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:47,019
What will you take in trade?

447
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:51,150
What do you got?

448
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:07,370
Outstanding!

449
00:36:07,877 --> 00:36:10,539
We've finally found something you do well!

450
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,043
What is your 6th general order?

451
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:22,148
Sir, to receive, obey and pass on
to the sentry who relieves me...

452
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:24,716
...all orders...

453
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:26,890
Sir, the 6th general...

454
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,562
The private does not know, sir!

455
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:32,965
You slimy scumbag,
get down and give me 25!

456
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:41,807
How many counts in that movement?

457
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:43,172
Sir, four, sir!

458
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,146
Why look down in the chamber?

459
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:49,445
Sir, to be sure the inspecting officer
is not given a loaded weapon, sir!

460
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:50,881
What's your 5th general order?

461
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:54,981
Sir, to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir!

462
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:57,421
What's this weapon's name?

463
00:36:57,594 --> 00:37:00,427
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir!

464
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:03,430
Private, you are definitely
born again hard.

465
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:07,161
I may even let you serve as a rifleman
in my beloved Corps.

466
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:14,536
"I don't want no teenage queen!

467
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:20,075
"I just want my M-14!

468
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:25,714
"If I die in the combat zone

469
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:31,092
"Box me up and ship me home!

470
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,698
"Pin my medals upon my chest!

471
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,294
"Tell my mom I've done my best!"

472
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:49,545
Graduation is only a few days away...

473
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,214
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

474
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:58,315
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

475
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:04,150
The instructors are proud to see us
growing beyond their control.

476
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:07,929
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

477
00:38:09,032 --> 00:38:11,296
The Marine Corps wants killers.

478
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:15,434
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

479
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:17,732
Men without fear.

480
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:21,933
Today...

481
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:25,278
...you people are no longer maggots.

482
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:29,645
Today, you are Marines.

483
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,054
You are part of a brotherhood.

484
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:37,718
From now on, until the day you die...

485
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,188
...wherever you are...

486
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:43,196
...every Marine is your brother.

487
00:38:45,468 --> 00:38:47,800
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

488
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:51,137
Some of you will not come back.

489
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:53,870
But always remember this:

490
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:55,943
Marines die.

491
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,309
That's what we're here for!

492
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:01,706
But the Marine Corps lives forever.

493
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:06,215
And that means you live forever!

494
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,623
0300, Infantry.

495
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,328
0300, Infantry.

496
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,598
1800, Engineers.
You go out and find mines.

497
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:24,996
Cowboy!

498
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,772
0300, Infantry.

499
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:31,273
0300, Infantry.

500
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:32,571
Joker!

501
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:34,441
4212...

502
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:36,417
...Basic Military Journalism.

503
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:38,314
You must be shitting me!

504
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:40,451
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

505
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:42,718
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

506
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:45,352
Sir, I wrote for
my high-school newspaper, sir!

507
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:49,023
Christ, you're not a writer,
you're a killer!

508
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:50,497
A killer, yes, sir!

509
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:51,692
Gomer Pyle!

510
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:59,006
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

511
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:07,448
Our last night on the island.

512
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:09,983
I draw fire watch.

513
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,977
Hi, Joker.

514
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:40,339
Are those...

515
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,807
...live rounds?

516
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:51,576
7.62 millimeter.

517
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:56,253
Full metal jacket.

518
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:11,400
Leonard, if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

519
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:15,406
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

520
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:20,710
I am...

521
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:24,519
...in a world...

522
00:42:27,023 --> 00:42:28,388
...of shit!

523
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:34,753
Left shoulder, hut!

524
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,499
Right shoulder, hut!

525
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,501
Lock and load.

526
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,336
Order, hut!

527
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,007
"This is my rifle!

528
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,943
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine."

529
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:02,620
Get back in your bunks!

530
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,586
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

531
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:10,590
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

532
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,959
Why is Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

533
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:17,065
Why is Pyle holding that weapon?

534
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,603
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

535
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:24,046
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform you...

536
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:28,140
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir!

537
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:39,423
Now listen to me, Private Pyle...

538
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,293
...and listen good.

539
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:45,290
I want that weapon...

540
00:43:46,235 --> 00:43:47,759
...and I want it now!

541
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:52,606
Place that rifle on the deck
at your feet...

542
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:55,777
...and step back away from it.

543
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:07,352
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

544
00:44:07,723 --> 00:44:11,853
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

545
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:38,815
Easy, Leonard.

546
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:44,558
Go easy, man.

547
00:46:12,548 --> 00:46:13,879
Hey, baby.

548
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,577
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

549
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,178
Not just this minute.

550
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:23,186
Well, baby, me so horny.

551
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:25,392
Me so horny.

552
00:46:26,228 --> 00:46:28,059
Me love you long time.

553
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:30,629
You party?

554
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,258
Yeah, we might party.

555
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:35,070
- How much?
- $15.

556
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:37,370
$15 for both of us?

557
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,374
No. Each you $15.

558
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:42,109
Me love you long time.

559
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:43,710
Me so horny.

560
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:46,774
$15 too beaucoup.

561
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:48,810
$5 each.

562
00:46:48,884 --> 00:46:50,351
Me suckee-suckee.

563
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:52,716
Me love you too much.

564
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,754
$5 is all my mom allows me to spend.

565
00:46:58,494 --> 00:47:00,655
Okay! $10 each.

566
00:47:01,664 --> 00:47:03,291
What do we get for $10?

567
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:06,360
Everything you want.

568
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:08,363
Everything?

569
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:15,275
Buddy, you feel like spending some
of your hard-earned money?

570
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:21,405
Half of these gook whores are officers
in the Viet Cong.

571
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:23,912
The other half have TB.

572
00:47:24,854 --> 00:47:27,254
Be sure you only fuck
the ones who cough.

573
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:18,539
That sucker really had some moves on him.

574
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,741
You know what pisses me off
about these people?

575
00:48:27,683 --> 00:48:30,846
We're helping them
and they shit all over us.

576
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,016
I just can't feature that.

577
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:36,016
Don't take it too hard.
It's just business.

578
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:41,491
I hate Da Nang.
I want to go out into the field.

579
00:48:42,331 --> 00:48:46,734
I'm here three months and all I do is take
handshake shots at award ceremonies.

580
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:50,397
You'd get wasted the first day
and it would be my fault.

581
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:52,837
A high-school girl could do my job.

582
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:54,839
I want to get into the shit.

583
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:56,673
I want some trigger time.

584
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:03,118
If you get killed, your mom will find me
and beat the shit out of me.

585
00:49:04,186 --> 00:49:05,585
That's a negative.

586
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:12,922
Let's keep it short and sweet.
Anybody got anything new?

587
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:18,930
Rumor has it that the Tet ceasefire
will be cancelled.

588
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:21,296
Rear echelon paranoia.

589
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:25,563
Intelligence says Charlie might try
something big during Tet.

590
00:49:25,774 --> 00:49:28,265
They say the same thing every year.

591
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:30,342
There's a lot of talk about it.

592
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:32,312
Don't lose any sleep over it.

593
00:49:32,448 --> 00:49:36,282
The Tet holiday is like July Fourth,
Christmas and New Year in one.

594
00:49:36,785 --> 00:49:40,243
Every zipperhead in the North and South,
will bang gongs...

595
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:42,390
...and bark at the moon.

596
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,985
Ann-Margret and entourage
are due next week.

597
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:50,223
I want someone to stick
with her for a few days.

598
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:51,926
Rafterman, you take it.

599
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:55,033
Get some good low-angle stuff.

600
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:58,972
Don't be obvious, but I want to see fur
and early morning dew.

601
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:05,305
"Diplomats in Dungarees. Marine
engineers rebuild Dong Phuc villages..."

602
00:50:05,548 --> 00:50:08,881
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees.

603
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:12,053
If they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

604
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:14,021
I'll make a note of it, sir.

605
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,418
"N.V.A. Soldier Deserts
After Reading Pamphlets."

606
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:21,486
"An N.V.A. regular, who realized
his side would lose...

607
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:24,157
"...deserted after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

608
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:27,566
That's good, Dave.
But why say, "N.V.A. regular"?

609
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,403
Is there an irregular?

610
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:31,462
How about N.V.A. soldier?

611
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,967
I'll fix it.

612
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:38,507
"The Lawrence Welk Show" will be on TV
in two weeks. Dave, do 100 words on it.

613
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:41,311
"Not While We're Eating."

614
00:50:41,483 --> 00:50:46,113
"N.V.A. learned not to interrupt meals of
Marines on a search-and-destroy mission."

615
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:50,491
We have a new directive from M.A.F.
on search and destroy.

616
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:55,726
Substitute "sweep and clear"
in place of "search and destroy."

617
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:56,787
Got it?

618
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,695
Got it. Very catchy.

619
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:01,659
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

620
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:07,698
The kill. The grunts
must have hit something.

621
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:09,934
Didn't see them.

622
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:13,648
I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

623
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:17,741
Grunts who buy toothbrushes
and deodorant for gooks:

624
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,854
"Winning of Hearts And Minds."

625
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:23,519
And combat action resulting in a kill:
"Winning the War."

626
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:27,290
You must have seen blood trails,
drag marks?

627
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,758
It was raining, sir.

628
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,828
That's why God passed
the law of probability.

629
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:35,968
Rewrite it with a happy ending,
say, one kill.

630
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:38,602
A sapper or an officer. Which?

631
00:51:39,074 --> 00:51:40,473
Whichever you say.

632
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:43,276
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

633
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:45,811
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

634
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,451
You'd like our guys to read
the paper and feel bad?

635
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:55,521
In case you didn't know,
this is not a popular war.

636
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:58,059
Our job is to report the news that the...

637
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,651
..."why-are-we-here"
civilian newsmen ignore.

638
00:52:01,563 --> 00:52:04,293
Maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

639
00:52:05,401 --> 00:52:08,393
You could find more blood trails
and drag marks.

640
00:52:09,672 --> 00:52:13,335
I've had my ass in the grass.
Can't say I liked it much.

641
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:16,500
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

642
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:20,046
My present duties keep me where I belong:

643
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:22,077
In the rear with the gear.

644
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:32,226
Tet. The Year of the Monkey.

645
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:35,456
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

646
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:40,762
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

647
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:53,177
I am fucking bored to death, man.

648
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,641
I have to get back in the shit.

649
00:52:57,252 --> 00:52:59,846
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

650
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:05,126
Joker's so tough, he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

651
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:08,022
...then ask for seconds.

652
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:10,231
Listen up, pilgrim.

653
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:14,992
A day without blood is like
a day without sunshine!

654
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:20,868
Joker thinks the bad bush is
between old mama-san's legs.

655
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:23,401
He's never been in the shit.

656
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,070
Hard to talk about. Like on Hastings.

657
00:53:26,381 --> 00:53:30,147
You weren't on Operation Hastings.
You weren't even in country.

658
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:34,655
Eat shit and die, you fucking
Spanish-American poge!

659
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:38,185
I was there! I was in the shit
with the grunts.

660
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:42,086
Don't listen to Payback's bullshit,
Rafterman.

661
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:45,498
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

662
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,194
You listen to Joker.

663
00:53:48,403 --> 00:53:49,836
He knows ti ti.

664
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:51,232
Very little.

665
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,071
He's never been in the shit
'cause he ain't got the stare.

666
00:53:55,878 --> 00:53:57,505
The 1,000-yard stare.

667
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,574
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit too long.

668
00:54:01,683 --> 00:54:04,948
It's like, it's like you've
really seen beyond.

669
00:54:06,188 --> 00:54:07,314
I got it.

670
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:10,524
All field Marines got it.
And you'll have it, too.

671
00:54:11,226 --> 00:54:12,215
I will?

672
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:17,728
How do you stop five blacks
from raping a white chick?

673
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,361
Fuck you.

674
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:21,265
Throw them a basketball.

675
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:27,132
Incoming.

676
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:31,177
They're outgoing!

677
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,678
- That ain't outgoing!
- That ain't outgoing!

678
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:37,343
Now what'd I just say?

679
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:19,157
I hope they're just fucking with us.

680
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:21,161
I ain't ready for this shit.

681
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,510
Cease fire!

682
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:28,356
Cease fire!

683
00:56:40,175 --> 00:56:41,335
The enemy...

684
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,108
...has very deceitfully...

685
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,244
...taken advantage of the ceasefire...

686
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:50,780
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

687
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,484
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

688
00:56:55,524 --> 00:56:57,583
But we seem to be the exception.

689
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:02,657
Charlie has hit every military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

690
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:04,592
In Saigon...

691
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,198
...the United States Embassy has been
overrun by suicide squads.

692
00:57:11,606 --> 00:57:14,404
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

693
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:19,073
We have reports that a division of N.V.A...

694
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:22,945
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

695
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:27,380
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

696
00:57:27,456 --> 00:57:30,186
...the civilian press are
wetting their pants...

697
00:57:30,392 --> 00:57:34,294
...and even Cronkite is going to say
the war is now unwinnable.

698
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,329
In other words...

699
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:41,734
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we all have to take a bite.

700
00:57:47,642 --> 00:57:50,008
Does this mean Ann-Margret's
not coming?

701
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:58,715
You go straight up to Phu Bai.

702
00:58:00,055 --> 00:58:02,114
Captain January will need you.

703
00:58:05,894 --> 00:58:08,021
And you take off that damn button.

704
00:58:09,064 --> 00:58:11,658
You can't get killed
wearing a peace symbol.

705
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:16,167
Permission to go with Joker.

706
00:58:17,172 --> 00:58:18,332
Granted.

707
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,774
Sir, permission not to take Rafterman.

708
00:58:22,477 --> 00:58:23,774
You still here?

709
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:27,705
Vanish ricky-tick
and take Rafterman with you.

710
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:30,314
You're responsible for him.

711
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:14,929
Get some! Get some!

712
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:35,511
Get some, baby!

713
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:47,251
I've got you, mother!

714
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:55,602
Anyone who runs is a VC.

715
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:58,429
Anyone who stands still...

716
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:01,300
...is a well-disciplined VC.

717
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:06,947
You guys ought to do a story about me.

718
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,446
Why should we do a story about you?

719
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,017
'Cause I'm so fucking good!

720
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:16,286
That ain't no shit neither.

721
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:20,761
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

722
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:23,397
And 50 water buffaloes, too.

723
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:26,026
Them are all certified.

724
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:29,860
Any women or children?

725
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:31,831
Sometimes.

726
01:00:33,408 --> 01:00:36,104
How can you kill women and children?

727
01:00:37,746 --> 01:00:38,644
Easy.

728
01:00:39,114 --> 01:00:41,207
You just don't lead them so much.

729
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:44,482
Ain't war hell?

730
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:23,782
We want to get in the shit.

731
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:25,653
Down the road. Two-five.

732
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,524
Outstanding! Thanks.

733
01:01:56,591 --> 01:01:59,389
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

734
01:01:59,828 --> 01:02:01,386
I got a bro named Cowboy.

735
01:02:01,463 --> 01:02:02,896
You people one-one?

736
01:02:02,964 --> 01:02:05,797
No, sir. We're reporters
for "Stars and Stripes."

737
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,460
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

738
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:12,229
He's just down the road
in the platoon area.

739
01:02:12,474 --> 01:02:13,998
May we tag along, sir?

740
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:15,906
No problem. Welcome aboard.

741
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:19,208
I'm Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski.

742
01:02:19,914 --> 01:02:21,814
They call me Mr.Touchdown.

743
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:24,343
I played ball for Notre Dame.

744
01:02:26,054 --> 01:02:28,045
You here to make Cowboy famous?

745
01:02:28,356 --> 01:02:29,789
Never happen, sir.

746
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:33,685
If you came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

747
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:37,259
We got Condition Red and we expect rain.

748
01:02:37,899 --> 01:02:40,367
Outstanding. We taking care of business?

749
01:02:40,769 --> 01:02:42,464
The N.V.A. are dug in deep.

750
01:02:42,537 --> 01:02:46,940
Hotel Company is working this side
of the river, house by house.

751
01:02:47,509 --> 01:02:51,809
Charles has his shit together,
but we're still getting some decent kills.

752
01:02:52,013 --> 01:02:55,710
We heard the N.V.A. executed
a lot of gook civilians.

753
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:57,779
Affirmative.

754
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:01,782
I saw bodies half a klick
this side of the canal.

755
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:03,715
Can you show me where?

756
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,450
The dead have been covered with lime.

757
01:03:35,523 --> 01:03:37,423
The dead know only one thing:

758
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:40,622
It is better to be alive.

759
01:03:51,973 --> 01:03:54,840
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

760
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:56,933
What outfit are you with?

761
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:58,979
We're from "Stars and Stripes."

762
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:03,374
I'm Sergeant Joker
and this photographer is Rafterman.

763
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:06,251
I'm Lt.Cleves. Hartford, Connecticut.

764
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,185
Have you got a body count, sir?

765
01:04:08,256 --> 01:04:09,245
Twenty.

766
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,418
How did it happen, sir?

767
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:14,855
The N.V.A. came in
with a list of gook names:

768
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:19,862
Government officials, policemen,
ARVN officers, teachers.

769
01:04:20,935 --> 01:04:25,235
They asked them, real polite, to report
the next day for political re-education.

770
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:29,034
Everybody who turned up got shot.

771
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:30,971
Some they buried alive.

772
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:39,384
What is that button on your body armor?

773
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:41,315
A peace symbol, sir.

774
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:44,017
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

775
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:46,393
What is written on your helmet?

776
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:47,951
"Born to Kill," sir.

777
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:51,190
You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

778
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:53,257
Is that some kind of sick joke?

779
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:56,164
Well, what does it mean?

780
01:04:56,538 --> 01:04:59,439
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know very much.

781
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:03,068
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will shit on you!

782
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:06,905
Answer my question
or you'll stand tall before the Man.

783
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:10,574
I was referring to the duality of man, sir.

784
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:13,944
The duality of man.
The Jungian thing, sir.

785
01:05:15,523 --> 01:05:17,616
- Whose side are you on?
- Our side, sir.

786
01:05:17,692 --> 01:05:19,626
- Don't you love your country?
- Yes, sir.

787
01:05:19,694 --> 01:05:23,687
Then get with the program. Jump on
the team and come in for the big win.

788
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:29,194
I ask that my Marines obey my orders
as they would the word of God.

789
01:05:29,904 --> 01:05:32,998
We are helping the Vietnamese,
because inside every gook...

790
01:05:33,074 --> 01:05:35,269
...is an American trying to get out.

791
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:37,741
It's a hardball world, son.

792
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:41,043
We must keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

793
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:56,797
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

794
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,230
Around the back.

795
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:09,367
- First Platoon?
- Through there.

796
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:35,467
Hey, Lone Ranger.

797
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:41,333
Holy shit!

798
01:06:49,017 --> 01:06:53,147
I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit!

799
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:55,854
What's happening?

800
01:06:56,190 --> 01:07:00,126
Just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

801
01:07:00,228 --> 01:07:01,593
Why go back?

802
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,420
Here or there, samey-same.

803
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:05,363
- Been getting any?
- Only your sister.

804
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:08,869
Better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

805
01:07:10,238 --> 01:07:11,967
Hey, you hogs, listen up!

806
01:07:12,974 --> 01:07:16,034
This is my bro, Joker, from the island.
And this is...

807
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:21,280
They're from "Stars and Stripes."
You'll be famous.

808
01:07:22,884 --> 01:07:26,615
We're the Lusthog squad.
We're lifetakers and heartbreakers.

809
01:07:27,655 --> 01:07:30,351
We shoot holes in them
and fill them with lead.

810
01:07:35,663 --> 01:07:37,392
Are you a photographer?

811
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:41,765
I'm a combat correspondent.

812
01:07:43,404 --> 01:07:45,338
You seen much combat?

813
01:07:48,576 --> 01:07:50,771
I've seen a little on TV.

814
01:07:55,316 --> 01:07:57,147
You're a real comedian.

815
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,220
Well, they call me the Joker.

816
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,292
Well, I've got a joke for you.

817
01:08:06,027 --> 01:08:08,291
I'm going to tear you a new asshole.

818
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,865
Well, pilgrim...

819
01:08:14,535 --> 01:08:18,904
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit!

820
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:26,712
You talk the talk.

821
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:29,976
Do you walk the walk?

822
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:37,387
You might not believe it...

823
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:41,519
...but under fire, Animal Mother
is a truly fine human being.

824
01:08:42,697 --> 01:08:45,894
He just needs grenades thrown
at him the rest of his life.

825
01:08:54,876 --> 01:08:58,312
Jungle bunny. Thank God
for the sickle cell, huh?

826
01:08:59,313 --> 01:09:00,541
Yeah, Mother.

827
01:09:02,283 --> 01:09:03,648
Hey, photographer!

828
01:09:05,586 --> 01:09:07,417
Want to take a good picture?

829
01:09:10,725 --> 01:09:11,817
Take this.

830
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:22,763
This...is my bro.

831
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:34,880
This is his party.

832
01:09:35,783 --> 01:09:37,478
He's the guest of honor.

833
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:40,684
Today is his birthday.

834
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,955
Happy birthday, zipperhead!

835
01:09:45,927 --> 01:09:47,827
I will never forget this day.

836
01:09:48,629 --> 01:09:52,497
The day I came to Hue city
and fought one million N.V.A. gooks.

837
01:09:54,268 --> 01:09:56,736
I really love the little Commie bastards.

838
01:09:58,106 --> 01:10:01,564
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

839
01:10:03,277 --> 01:10:05,404
These are great days we're living!

840
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:10,441
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

841
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,415
These people we wasted here today...

842
01:10:15,022 --> 01:10:17,547
...are the finest people we will ever know.

843
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:24,059
Once we rotate back to the world, we'll
miss not having anyone worth shooting.

844
01:12:00,862 --> 01:12:03,490
Delta 6 Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

845
01:12:13,107 --> 01:12:15,803
We are receiving incoming fire
from the ville.

846
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:17,939
The lieutenant is down.

847
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:20,673
We'll stop and check out
what's in front of us.

848
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:28,514
Okay, Lusthog squad, listen up!

849
01:12:29,624 --> 01:12:31,524
We'll move up these two roads.

850
01:12:31,592 --> 01:12:33,753
I want the third team up this road.

851
01:12:34,428 --> 01:12:37,363
First and second team behind me
up this other road.

852
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:40,667
Let's go! Let's get it done!

853
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:11,736
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

854
01:17:12,072 --> 01:17:15,064
Start the cameras.
This is "Vietnam: The Movie"!

855
01:17:15,376 --> 01:17:17,503
If Joker is John Wayne, I'm a horse!

856
01:17:17,578 --> 01:17:20,342
- T.H.E. Rock can be a rock!
- I'll be Ann-Margret!

857
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:22,438
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

858
01:17:22,516 --> 01:17:25,178
- I'll be General Custer!
- Who'll be the Indian?

859
01:17:25,252 --> 01:17:27,777
We'll let the gooks play the Indians!

860
01:18:06,393 --> 01:18:07,985
You're going home now.

861
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:13,491
Semper fi.

862
01:18:17,204 --> 01:18:18,899
We're mean Marines, sir.

863
01:18:23,177 --> 01:18:24,439
Go easy, bros.

864
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:30,883
Better you than me.

865
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:37,417
At least they died for a good cause.

866
01:18:38,692 --> 01:18:40,182
What cause was that?

867
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:43,485
Freedom.

868
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:46,959
Flush out your head gear, New Guy.

869
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:51,800
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

870
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,137
This is a slaughter.

871
01:18:56,844 --> 01:18:59,404
If I get my balls blown off for a word...

872
01:19:01,515 --> 01:19:03,346
...my word is "poontang."

873
01:19:07,154 --> 01:19:08,917
Tough break for Hand Job.

874
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:13,385
He was set to get shipped out
on a medical.

875
01:19:15,763 --> 01:19:17,458
What was wrong with him?

876
01:19:19,933 --> 01:19:22,197
He was jerking off ten times a day.

877
01:19:24,571 --> 01:19:27,301
It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

878
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:34,212
Last week he was sent to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

879
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:38,743
The crazy fucker jerks off
in the waiting room.

880
01:19:40,254 --> 01:19:41,915
Instant Section 8.

881
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:46,320
He was waiting for his papers
to clear division.

882
01:19:49,508 --> 01:19:50,532
Ready?

883
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:51,867
Turnover.

884
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:56,143
Hue city interviews. Roll 34.

885
01:20:00,286 --> 01:20:03,585
This is a major city,
so we have to assault with...

886
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,390
...tanks in the streets.

887
01:20:06,759 --> 01:20:08,693
They send us in first squad...

888
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:11,628
...to make sure there are no little, uh...

889
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:16,659
...Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

890
01:20:16,735 --> 01:20:21,365
So we roll the tanks in and basically,
blow the place to hell.

891
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:25,243
When we're in Hue, in Hue city...

892
01:20:26,478 --> 01:20:28,378
...it's like a war, you know.

893
01:20:30,616 --> 01:20:34,279
Like what I thought about, what I
thought a war was supposed to be.

894
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:39,423
There's the enemy, kill them.

895
01:20:40,259 --> 01:20:42,955
There's no question about it.
We're the best.

896
01:20:43,529 --> 01:20:47,898
It's bullshit about Air Cav. When
the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

897
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:50,829
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine!

898
01:20:51,837 --> 01:20:54,135
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

899
01:20:55,341 --> 01:20:58,401
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam,
I'll tell you that.

900
01:20:59,578 --> 01:21:01,045
Can I quote L.B.J.?

901
01:21:03,215 --> 01:21:04,944
"I will not send...

902
01:21:05,351 --> 01:21:09,287
"...American boys 10,000 miles
around the world...

903
01:21:09,388 --> 01:21:12,619
"...to do a job Asian boys
should be doing for themselves."

904
01:21:15,427 --> 01:21:17,019
Personally, I think...

905
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:20,358
...they don't want to be involved
in this war.

906
01:21:21,133 --> 01:21:22,760
I think they sort of...

907
01:21:24,236 --> 01:21:28,570
...took away our freedom and gave it
to the gooks. They don't want it.

908
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:31,701
They'd rather be alive than free.

909
01:21:31,877 --> 01:21:33,435
Poor dumb bastards.

910
01:21:35,047 --> 01:21:37,982
The ones I'm fighting at are some pretty...

911
01:21:38,784 --> 01:21:41,252
...pretty bad boys. I'm not real, uh...

912
01:21:42,888 --> 01:21:44,515
I'm not real keen on...

913
01:21:45,157 --> 01:21:48,320
...these fellows that are supposedly
on our side.

914
01:21:49,495 --> 01:21:51,895
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

915
01:21:56,035 --> 01:21:59,596
We get killed for these people
and they don't even appreciate it.

916
01:22:01,273 --> 01:22:03,070
They think it's a big joke.

917
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:05,174
If you ask me...

918
01:22:06,245 --> 01:22:08,372
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

919
01:22:08,747 --> 01:22:11,682
It depends. I'm here
to take combat photos.

920
01:22:12,518 --> 01:22:15,487
But if the shit gets too thick,
I'll go to the rifle.

921
01:22:17,056 --> 01:22:19,957
What do I think of America's involvement
in the war?

922
01:22:20,025 --> 01:22:21,617
I think we should win.

923
01:22:22,428 --> 01:22:23,725
I hate Vietnam.

924
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:28,057
There's not one horse
in the whole country.

925
01:22:29,068 --> 01:22:31,536
There's something wrong with that.

926
01:22:33,205 --> 01:22:35,230
If they'd send us more guys maybe...

927
01:22:35,307 --> 01:22:38,538
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

928
01:22:39,978 --> 01:22:42,378
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam...

929
01:22:42,915 --> 01:22:44,906
...the jewel of Southeast Asia.

930
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:46,779
I wanted to meet...

931
01:22:46,852 --> 01:22:50,219
...interesting people of an ancient culture
and kill them.

932
01:22:52,391 --> 01:22:56,293
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

933
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,684
'Morning, little schoolgirl.

934
01:23:24,289 --> 01:23:26,348
I'm a little schoolboy, too.

935
01:23:28,994 --> 01:23:32,122
- What you got there?
- Do you want No.1 fuckee?

936
01:23:33,565 --> 01:23:36,159
Any of you boys want
No.1 fuckee?

937
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:38,833
I'm so horny I can't even get
a piece of hand!

938
01:23:38,904 --> 01:23:39,928
Me want suckee.

939
01:23:40,005 --> 01:23:44,840
Suckee, fuckee, she give you everything
you want. Long time.

940
01:23:45,177 --> 01:23:47,737
Everything you want! All right!

941
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,174
How much, chief?

942
01:23:49,248 --> 01:23:50,510
$15 each.

943
01:23:53,852 --> 01:23:55,820
$15 beaucoup money.

944
01:23:56,722 --> 01:23:57,746
$5 each.

945
01:23:58,257 --> 01:24:00,054
Come on, she love you good.

946
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,389
Boom-boom long time. $10.

947
01:24:02,628 --> 01:24:03,526
$5.

948
01:24:03,695 --> 01:24:04,923
No, $10.

949
01:24:05,364 --> 01:24:07,298
Trade you some ARVN rifles.

950
01:24:07,599 --> 01:24:09,965
Never been fired and only dropped once.

951
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,097
Okay, $5. You give me.

952
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:18,667
Let's get mounted.

953
01:24:23,749 --> 01:24:25,376
Something wrong, chief?

954
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:27,542
She says no boom-boom with you.

955
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:29,209
What the motherfuck?

956
01:24:29,454 --> 01:24:31,615
She says soul brother too beaucoup.

957
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:37,388
He's saying you black boys
pack too much meat!

958
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:47,903
She looks like she could suck
the chrome off a trailer hitch.

959
01:24:48,473 --> 01:24:50,668
She say too beaucoup. Too beaucoup.

960
01:24:51,543 --> 01:24:52,908
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:24:54,046 --> 01:24:57,641
What we have here is a magnificent...

962
01:24:57,749 --> 01:25:00,445
...specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

963
01:25:01,053 --> 01:25:03,180
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

964
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:05,820
Okay. Okay.

965
01:25:12,764 --> 01:25:15,164
- We need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

966
01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:18,533
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

967
01:25:18,804 --> 01:25:22,137
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

968
01:25:25,544 --> 01:25:28,843
Hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

969
01:25:29,815 --> 01:25:32,306
- I don't want it after you, man!
- Fuck you!

970
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:07,682
Intelligence passed the word down...

971
01:26:07,853 --> 01:26:11,414
...that during the night the N.V.A.
pulled out of our area...

972
01:26:11,523 --> 01:26:13,991
...to positions across the Perfume River.

973
01:26:14,693 --> 01:26:18,459
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

974
01:26:50,595 --> 01:26:53,325
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!

975
01:27:16,922 --> 01:27:18,651
He ain't going to make it.

976
01:27:29,935 --> 01:27:32,165
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

977
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:37,005
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

978
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:42,306
Murph, this is Cowboy.

979
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:45,179
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

980
01:27:47,386 --> 01:27:48,375
Wait one.

981
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:56,292
You're senior NCO. Take charge
and continue with the patrol.

982
01:27:56,561 --> 01:27:58,859
Call in at the next checkpoint. Over.

983
01:27:59,297 --> 01:28:00,889
Roger. Understand.

984
01:28:08,407 --> 01:28:09,897
I'm squad leader.

985
01:28:13,278 --> 01:28:15,405
I'll follow you anywhere, scumbag.

986
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,142
He's dead.

987
01:29:10,001 --> 01:29:11,093
What's up?

988
01:29:11,636 --> 01:29:14,127
We made a mistake at the last checkpoint.

989
01:29:15,073 --> 01:29:16,734
See what you think.

990
01:29:19,644 --> 01:29:21,612
I think we're here...

991
01:29:23,215 --> 01:29:25,206
...and we should be here.

992
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:28,845
We're here?

993
01:29:30,088 --> 01:29:31,487
We should be here?

994
01:29:46,438 --> 01:29:47,837
What do you think?

995
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:51,902
I think we should change direction.

996
01:30:08,693 --> 01:30:10,320
We'll change direction.

997
01:30:21,306 --> 01:30:22,364
What's up?

998
01:30:23,141 --> 01:30:24,631
Change in direction.

999
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:27,004
Are we lost?

1000
01:30:27,145 --> 01:30:29,113
Joker, shut the fuck up!

1001
01:30:30,549 --> 01:30:32,016
Okay, listen up!

1002
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:34,216
Can you hear me?

1003
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,849
We're changing direction.

1004
01:30:37,122 --> 01:30:38,953
We're heading over that way.

1005
01:30:39,057 --> 01:30:41,491
Eightball's going to find a way through.

1006
01:30:42,727 --> 01:30:43,751
Got it?

1007
01:30:45,797 --> 01:30:47,788
Eightball, let's dance.

1008
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:51,426
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1009
01:32:10,048 --> 01:32:11,345
Cease fire!

1010
01:32:11,616 --> 01:32:13,277
Cease fire, goddamn it!

1011
01:32:13,618 --> 01:32:15,950
Cool it, goddamn it! Cease fire!

1012
01:32:19,424 --> 01:32:23,258
Listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1013
01:32:25,497 --> 01:32:26,657
Negative!

1014
01:32:26,731 --> 01:32:29,564
Save your ammo!
Nobody fire till I tell you!

1015
01:32:32,937 --> 01:32:35,167
No! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1016
01:32:35,573 --> 01:32:37,131
Animal, cease fire!

1017
01:32:37,409 --> 01:32:39,070
It's Sergeant Murphy.

1018
01:32:39,778 --> 01:32:41,268
Cowboy. Over.

1019
01:32:41,379 --> 01:32:44,542
Murphy. What is your present position?
Over.

1020
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:47,109
Receiving enemy sniper fire.

1021
01:32:47,552 --> 01:32:48,849
Eightball is down.

1022
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,753
We're half a klick north
of checkpoint No.4.

1023
01:32:52,057 --> 01:32:55,549
Possible strong enemy forces in front of us.

1024
01:32:55,894 --> 01:32:58,385
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1025
01:32:59,764 --> 01:33:01,391
Roger. Understand.

1026
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:03,730
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1027
01:33:06,604 --> 01:33:07,730
Stay close.

1028
01:33:09,607 --> 01:33:13,373
Listen up! I think we're being
set up for an ambush.

1029
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:17,145
There may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings.

1030
01:33:17,549 --> 01:33:19,540
I've requested tank support.

1031
01:33:19,617 --> 01:33:21,050
We'll sit tight...

1032
01:33:21,419 --> 01:33:24,286
...but keep our eyes open.
If they hit us...

1033
01:33:24,456 --> 01:33:26,447
...we'll have to pull back fast.

1034
01:33:27,959 --> 01:33:30,689
Goddamn it! Cease your fire, Mother!

1035
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:32,623
Cease your fucking fire!

1036
01:33:33,631 --> 01:33:35,030
We can't leave him!

1037
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,762
We'll get him when the tank comes up.

1038
01:33:37,902 --> 01:33:40,302
He's hit three times! He can't wait!

1039
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:45,335
That sniper's just trying
to suck us in one at a time.

1040
01:33:48,313 --> 01:33:50,338
Goddamn it! No!

1041
01:33:51,483 --> 01:33:53,110
Goddamn it, cease fire!

1042
01:33:54,552 --> 01:33:56,611
Fuck this shit!
I'm going in to bring him out!

1043
01:33:56,688 --> 01:33:59,179
Sit the fuck down, goddamn it!

1044
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,508
Okay, cease fire! He's there!

1045
01:34:34,359 --> 01:34:35,826
Hold your fire!

1046
01:34:36,027 --> 01:34:37,358
Hold your fire!

1047
01:34:38,263 --> 01:34:40,595
You can't see the sniper!

1048
01:34:40,999 --> 01:34:44,457
Save the ammo! Nobody fire
till I tell you! Nobody!

1049
01:34:50,775 --> 01:34:52,106
Hold your fire!

1050
01:34:53,278 --> 01:34:55,075
What the fuck do we do now?

1051
01:34:57,015 --> 01:34:58,812
Give me that fucking radio.

1052
01:35:03,221 --> 01:35:05,155
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1053
01:35:07,725 --> 01:35:12,025
We're in deep shit. Two men down.
What's the story on the tank? Over.

1054
01:35:14,132 --> 01:35:15,292
Sorry, Cowboy.

1055
01:35:15,366 --> 01:35:17,300
No luck so far with the tank.

1056
01:35:17,535 --> 01:35:19,264
Will advise. Over.

1057
01:35:23,441 --> 01:35:25,102
Numb-nut bastards.

1058
01:35:25,877 --> 01:35:27,242
Okay, listen up!

1059
01:35:29,881 --> 01:35:31,576
Can't wait for the tank.

1060
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:34,084
They're going to hit us any minute.

1061
01:35:34,152 --> 01:35:36,245
When they do, we won't have time.

1062
01:35:36,554 --> 01:35:39,079
We have to pull out now. Get ready.

1063
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:41,990
Wait! Hold it!

1064
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:44,018
Nobody's pulling out!

1065
01:35:44,295 --> 01:35:46,286
There's only one fucking sniper!

1066
01:35:46,364 --> 01:35:47,388
Back off!

1067
01:35:47,832 --> 01:35:50,630
I'm calling the plays and I say we pull out!

1068
01:35:50,835 --> 01:35:52,735
What about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1069
01:35:52,804 --> 01:35:56,535
It's shitty, but we can't refuse
to accept the situation.

1070
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:59,199
We're not leaving them out there!

1071
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:00,971
They're wasted!

1072
01:36:01,379 --> 01:36:02,710
You know that!

1073
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:05,275
Come on, we gotta bring them back.

1074
01:36:05,483 --> 01:36:06,745
Let's do it!

1075
01:36:06,985 --> 01:36:09,112
Stand down! That's a direct order.

1076
01:36:13,424 --> 01:36:16,325
Fuck you, Cowboy!
Fuck all you assholes!

1077
01:36:19,664 --> 01:36:20,756
Goddamn it!

1078
01:36:20,832 --> 01:36:22,493
Fucking son of a bitch!

1079
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:24,493
You motherfucker!

1080
01:36:45,823 --> 01:36:47,290
Where's the sniper?

1081
01:36:50,762 --> 01:36:53,128
Doc, where's the sniper?

1082
01:37:02,573 --> 01:37:03,505
Shit!

1083
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:07,639
Shit! Fuck!

1084
01:38:01,165 --> 01:38:03,599
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!

1085
01:38:05,303 --> 01:38:07,567
There's only one sniper!

1086
01:38:09,173 --> 01:38:12,006
Move up the squad!
You're clear up to here!

1087
01:38:17,882 --> 01:38:19,372
Son of a bitch.

1088
01:38:27,558 --> 01:38:31,392
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
come with me. We'll take a look.

1089
01:38:32,163 --> 01:38:34,427
You stay put and cover our ass!

1090
01:38:34,799 --> 01:38:36,824
We may come back in a big hurry!

1091
01:38:38,603 --> 01:38:40,833
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming, too.

1092
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:43,929
All set?

1093
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:45,664
Let's move!

1094
01:39:26,984 --> 01:39:29,282
Top of the building, round the corner.

1095
01:39:49,173 --> 01:39:50,936
Give me that radio.

1096
01:39:54,512 --> 01:39:56,104
This is Cowboy. Over.

1097
01:40:07,325 --> 01:40:10,522
Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot
through the hole!

1098
01:40:24,942 --> 01:40:26,273
That son of a bitch!

1099
01:40:26,344 --> 01:40:27,811
You'll be all right.

1100
01:40:27,879 --> 01:40:30,211
Don't shit me, Joker!

1101
01:40:31,716 --> 01:40:34,014
I'm not. You're my favorite turd.

1102
01:40:41,826 --> 01:40:43,453
Hang on, man! Hang on!

1103
01:40:47,698 --> 01:40:48,995
I can hack it.

1104
01:40:56,807 --> 01:40:58,297
I can hack it.

1105
01:41:56,334 --> 01:41:58,063
Let's go get some payback.

1106
01:42:04,842 --> 01:42:05,809
Okay.

1107
01:42:21,692 --> 01:42:23,387
Watch that fucking hole.

1108
01:42:25,029 --> 01:42:26,553
Give them some smoke.

1109
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,040
Ready?

1110
01:43:25,589 --> 01:43:28,285
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1111
01:43:34,432 --> 01:43:36,423
Joker, in there! New Guy!

1112
01:45:41,192 --> 01:45:43,592
We got the sniper!

1113
01:46:21,665 --> 01:46:22,757
What's up?

1114
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:26,259
We got the sniper.

1115
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:40,940
I saved Joker's ass.

1116
01:46:41,519 --> 01:46:42,884
I got the sniper.

1117
01:46:43,654 --> 01:46:45,781
I fucking blew her away!

1118
01:46:47,124 --> 01:46:48,819
Am I bad?

1119
01:46:49,627 --> 01:46:52,562
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1120
01:47:11,248 --> 01:47:12,647
What's she saying?

1121
01:47:16,954 --> 01:47:18,216
She's praying.

1122
01:47:22,793 --> 01:47:24,988
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1123
01:47:28,999 --> 01:47:31,126
There's nothing we can do for her.

1124
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:34,535
She's dead meat.

1125
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:44,170
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1126
01:47:48,919 --> 01:47:50,216
What about her?

1127
01:47:54,592 --> 01:47:55,650
Fuck her.

1128
01:47:57,528 --> 01:47:58,688
Let her rot.

1129
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,579
We can't just leave her here.

1130
01:48:21,085 --> 01:48:22,382
Hey, asshole...

1131
01:48:23,487 --> 01:48:24,954
...Cowboy's wasted.

1132
01:48:26,256 --> 01:48:28,087
You're fresh out of friends.

1133
01:48:29,927 --> 01:48:31,724
I'm running this squad now.

1134
01:48:31,895 --> 01:48:34,955
And I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1135
01:48:39,903 --> 01:48:41,996
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1136
01:48:45,075 --> 01:48:47,703
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.

1137
01:48:58,322 --> 01:49:00,620
Shoot... me.

1138
01:49:03,227 --> 01:49:04,421
Shoot...

1139
01:49:05,562 --> 01:49:06,586
...me.

1140
01:49:19,076 --> 01:49:21,408
If you want to waste her, go on...

1141
01:49:24,448 --> 01:49:25,642
...waste her.

1142
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,400
Shoot.

1143
01:50:43,127 --> 01:50:47,063
We'll have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of... Ugly!

1144
01:50:51,502 --> 01:50:52,992
Hardcore, man.

1145
01:50:55,839 --> 01:50:57,466
Fucking hardcore.

1146
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:19,455
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1147
01:51:20,998 --> 01:51:24,991
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1148
01:51:34,745 --> 01:51:38,306
"We play fair and we work hard
And we're in harmony

1149
01:51:39,183 --> 01:51:42,880
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1150
01:51:47,925 --> 01:51:50,723
"Forever let us hold our banner high

1151
01:51:52,529 --> 01:51:54,429
"Boys and girls from far and near

1152
01:51:54,498 --> 01:51:56,363
"You're welcome as can be

1153
01:51:56,934 --> 01:52:00,768
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1154
01:52:01,505 --> 01:52:03,632
"Who's the leader of the club..."

1155
01:52:04,141 --> 01:52:08,043
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1156
01:52:08,645 --> 01:52:13,605
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming fuck fantasy.

1157
01:52:15,319 --> 01:52:17,651
I am so happy that I am alive...

1158
01:52:18,222 --> 01:52:20,486
...in one piece, and short.

1159
01:52:22,392 --> 01:52:25,054
I'm in a world of shit, yes.

1160
01:52:25,896 --> 01:52:27,386
But I am alive.

1161
01:52:28,098 --> 01:52:29,759
And I am not afraid.
