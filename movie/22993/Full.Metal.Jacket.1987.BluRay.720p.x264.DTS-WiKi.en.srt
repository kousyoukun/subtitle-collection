1
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,630
"America has heard the bugle call

2
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:41,013
"And you know it involves us one and all

3
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:49,312
"I don't suppose that war will ever end

4
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:57,487
"There's fighting
that will break us up again

5
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:05,411
"Good-bye, my darling
Hello, Vietnam

6
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:13,752
"I'm here to take a battle to be won

7
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:22,177
"Kiss me good-bye
And write me while I'm gone

8
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:30,477
"Good-bye, my sweetheart
Hello, Vietnam "

9
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:39,152
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

10
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,363
You will speak only when spoken to.

11
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:46,284
The first and last words
out of your sewers will be "Sir! "

12
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,202
Do you maggots understand?

13
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,829
Sir, yes, sir!

14
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:53,249
I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

15
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:59,004
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

16
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:03,800
...you will be a weapon,
a minister of death, praying for war.

17
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:06,803
But until that day, you are pukes!

18
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,472
The lowest form of life on Earth.

19
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,933
You are not even human fucking beings!

20
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:16,604
You are only unorganized,
grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit!

21
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,941
Because I am hard, you won't like me.

22
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,777
The more you hate me,
the more you'll learn.

23
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,154
I am hard, but I am fair!

24
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,573
There is no racial bigotry here!

25
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:31,744
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

26
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:34,371
Here, you are all equally worthless!

27
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,458
My orders are to weed out non-hackers...

28
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,711
...who do not pack the gear
to be in my beloved Corps!

29
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,963
Do you maggots understand that?

30
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:46,341
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

31
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,097
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

32
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:55,850
From now on you're Private Snowball!
Like that name?

33
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,268
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,854
There's one thing you won't like!

35
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,316
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

36
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,109
...in my mess hall!

37
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,404
Is that you, John Wayne?

38
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,655
Is this me?

39
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,282
Who said that?

40
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,701
Who the fuck said that?

41
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:17,579
Who's the slimy communist cocksucker
down here...

42
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:20,165
...who just signed his own death warrant?

43
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,084
Nobody, huh?

44
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,337
The fairy fucking godmother said it!

45
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:29,382
Out-fucking-standing!
I will P.T. you all until you die!

46
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:32,510
I will P.T. you until your assholes
suck buttermilk!

47
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,387
Was it you, you little fuck?

48
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:38,933
You look like a fucking worm !
I bet it was you!

49
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,436
Sir, I said it, sir!

50
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,773
Well, no shit.

51
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:49,527
What are you, a fucking comedian?
Private Joker.

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,487
I admire your honesty.

53
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:55,324
I like you. Come over to my house
and fuck my sister!

54
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:01,163
You little scumbag! I've got your name!
I've got your ass!

55
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,498
You will not laugh or cry!

56
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:06,168
You will learn by the number!

57
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,086
Get up! Get on your feet!

58
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:13,508
Unfuck yourself or I'll unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!

59
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,429
-Why did you join my beloved Corps?
-Sir, to kill, sir!

60
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:19,889
You're a killer!

61
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,183
Let me see your war face!

62
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,519
You've got a war face?

63
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,773
That's a war face! Let me see yours!

64
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:33,569
You didn't convince me!
Let me see your real war face!

65
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,531
You don't scare me! Work on it!

66
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,701
What's your excuse?

67
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,202
Sir, excuse, sir?

68
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:45,247
I'm asking the fucking questions,
understand?

69
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:49,084
Thank you!
Can I be in charge for a while?

70
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,045
Are you shook up? Nervous?

71
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,380
Sir, I am, sir!

72
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,048
Do I make you nervous?

73
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,052
Were you about to call me an asshole?

74
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,388
-How tall are you, Private?
-Sir, 5'9", sir!

75
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,558
I didn't know they stacked shit that high!

76
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:08,269
Trying to squeeze an inch in on me, huh?

77
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,857
The best part of you ran down
the crack of your mama's ass...

78
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,735
...and ended up as a brown stain
on the mattress!

79
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,946
Where in hell are you from?

80
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,785
Holy dogshit! Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy!

81
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:28,330
You don't look like a steer,
so that narrows it down!

82
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:29,915
Suck dicks?

83
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,292
You a peter-puffer?

84
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,795
I bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,257
...and not have the courtesy
to give him a reach-around!

86
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,342
I'll be watching you!

87
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,763
Your parents have children that lived?

88
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,057
Bet they regret that!

89
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,935
You're so ugly
you're a modern-art masterpiece!

90
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,812
-What's your name, fatbody?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!

91
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,773
Lawrence, what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,610
That name sounds like royalty!
You royalty?

93
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,862
You suck dicks?

94
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,907
Bet you could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!

95
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,704
I don't like that name!
Faggots and sailors are called Lawrence!

96
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,914
From now on you're Gomer Pyle!

97
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,459
Think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
Think I'm funny?

98
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,671
Then wipe off that disgusting grin!

99
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,966
Any fucking time, sweetheart!

100
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,635
I'm trying, sir!

101
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,970
I'll give you three seconds...

102
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,306
...exactly three fucking seconds...

103
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,808
...to wipe off that stupid grin...

104
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,979
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you!

105
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,652
-Sir, I can't help it, sir!
-Get on your knees, scumbag!

106
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,572
Now choke yourself!

107
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,743
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts!

108
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,080
Don't pull my hand over there!

109
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:58,625
I said choke yourself!
Lean forward and choke yourself!

110
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,505
Are you through grinning?

111
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:07,633
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

112
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:13,597
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!
Sound off like you got a pair!

113
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:18,560
That's enough. Get on your feet!

114
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,359
Pyle, square your ass away and
start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

115
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:29,029
...or I will definitely fuck you up!

116
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,834
Parris Island, South Carolina...

117
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:46,045
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

118
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:50,257
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

119
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:53,260
"Mama and Papa were laying in bed!

120
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,266
"Mama rolled over
and this is what she said:

121
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,562
"'Oh, give me some...

122
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,523
"'...P.T.!'

123
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,277
"Good for you and good for me!

124
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,445
"Mmm, good!

125
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,365
"Up in the morning to the rising sun!

126
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,619
"Gotta run all day...

127
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:21,496
"...till the running's done!

"Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch!

129
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,132
"Got the blueballs, crabs
and the seven-year itch!"

130
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,279
Left shoulder, hut!

131
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,701
What are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

132
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:02,952
Sir, I don't know, sir!

133
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:07,957
Do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,753
You did that on purpose!
You want to be different!

135
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:16,465
-What side was that?
-Sir, left side, sir!

136
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:18,634
Are you sure, Private Pyle?

137
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,221
What side was that?

138
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,847
Sir, right side, sir!

139
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,433
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle!

140
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:28,477
Pick up your fucking cover!

141
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:04,303
Tonight, you pukes will sleep
with your rifles!

142
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,181
You will give your rifle a girl's name!

143
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,311
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get!

144
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:18,399
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

145
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,028
...through her pretty
pink panties are over!

146
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:25,198
You're married to this piece...

147
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,617
...this weapon of iron and wood!

148
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:30,494
And you will be faithful!

149
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,751
Prepare to mount!

150
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:56,269
Pray!

151
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,688
"This is my rifle.

152
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,233
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

153

"I must fire my rifle true.

00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:28,341
"I must shoot him before he shoots me.

161
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:29,593
"I will.

162
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,846
"Before God I swear this creed.

163
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:36,641
"My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

164
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:39,102
"We are the masters of our enemy.

165
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,646
"We are the saviors of my life.

166
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,231
"So be it...

167
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:46,150
"...until there is no enemy, but peace.

168
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,485
"Amen."

169
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:55,367
At ease!

170
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,412
Good night, ladies!

171
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:02,749
Hit it!

172
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,302
This is not your daddy's shotgun,
Cowboy!

173
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:26,355
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle!

174
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,656
Four inches from your chest, Pyle!

175
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:37,074
Four inches!

176
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:41,036
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

177
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,497
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun!

178
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:46,333
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

179
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,044
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun! "

180
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:11,440
You're bouncing!

181
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:28,790
Ten fucking seconds!

182
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:33,336
It should take you ten seconds
to negotiate this obstacle!

183
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,463
Quickly, move it out!

184
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:39,133
No swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

185
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:43,471
...until they get this obstacle down
to less than ten fucking seconds!

186
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,995
Next two! Quickly!

187
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,831
Get over that goddamn obstacle!
Move it!

188
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,046
Private Joker, are you a killer?

189
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:20,590
Let me hear your war cry!

190
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,888
Get your fat ass over there!

191
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:29,015
That's right, Private Pyle...

192
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:32,476
...don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top!

193
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:37,564
If God wanted you up there,
He'd have miracled your ass up there!

194
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,609
Get your fat ass up there!

195
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,778
What the hell's wrong with you?

196
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:48,200
If there was some pussy up there,
you could get up there, couldn't you?

197
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:53,163
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum, Pyle.

198
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,127
One for the commandant!

199
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:02,213
One for the Corps!

200
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:04,841
Get up there!

201
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,092
Pull!

202
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:10,221
The Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, Pyle!

203
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:11,972
Pull!

204
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:13,766
Pull, Pyle, pull!

205
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:16,727
One pull-up, Pyle! Come on, pull!

206
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:20,230
You've got to be shitting me!
Get your ass up there!

207
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:24,276
Do you mean to tell me you cannot do
one single pull-up?

208
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:28,530
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle!
Get out of my face!

209
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:30,740
Get up there, Snowball.

210
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,827
Get up here, fatboy!

211
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:36,871
Quickly! Move it up, Pyle! Move it up!

212
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:41,626
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

213
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:44,629
Get up here! You're too slow! Move it!

214
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,966
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down!

215
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,218
That would break my fucking heart!

216
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,888
Quickly! Up and over! Up and over!

217
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:58,392
What in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

218
00:15:58,767 --> 00:15:59,977
Get up and over!

219
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,854
Move it, move it!

220
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,481
Are you quitting on me?

221
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,858
Well, are you?

222
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,488
Then quit, you slimy, fucking,
walrus-looking piece of shit!

223
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,366
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

224
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,076
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

225
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,537
Now! Move it!

226
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:25,084
I'm going to rip your balls off so you
can't contaminate the rest of the world!

227
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:28,004
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

228
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:32,341
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo!

229
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,095
Pick 'em up and set 'em down, Pyle!

230
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,389
Quickly! Move it up!

231
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,435
Were you born a fat, slimy scumbag,
you piece of shit, Private Pyle?

232
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,771
Or did you have to work on it?

233
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:47,230
Move it up!

234
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,649
Quickly! Hustle up!

235
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:54,279
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, Private Pyle!

236
00:16:56,614 --> 00:17:00,535
Are you going to fucking die?
Are you going to die on me?

237
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:01,994
Do it now!

238
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:03,913
Move it up!

239
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:06,332
Hustle it up! Quickly!

240
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,960
Feel dizzy?

241
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:11,587
Faint?

242
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:17,301
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on!

243
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,599
Quickly, ladies! Assholes and elbows!
Move it out!

244
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:25,225
Get up!

245
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,625
Reveille! Reveille!

246
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,961
Drop your cocks and grab your socks!

247
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:56,797
Today is Sunday!
Divine worship is 0800.

248
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:59,550
Get your bunks made
and your uniforms on.

249
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:02,010
Police call in two minutes.

250
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:04,846
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

251
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,809
Finish your bunks, then you two turds
clean the head.

252
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,355
I want that head so sanitary...

253
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:17,317
...that the Virgin Mary could go
in there and take a dump!

254
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,695
Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?

255
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,405
Sir, no, sir!

256
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,537
Private Joker, I don't believe
I heard you correctly!

257
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,248
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!

258
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:35,000
You little maggot!
You make me want to vomit!

259
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:39,880
You communist heathen, sound off
that you love the Virgin Mary...

260
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,174
...or I'll stomp your guts out!

261
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,926
You love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

262
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,386
Negative, sir!

263
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,181
Are you trying to offend me?

264
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:53,685
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong!

265
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:57,689
And that you will beat him harder
if he reverses himself, sir!

266
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,607
Who's your squad leader?

267
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:02,610
The private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir!

268
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,365
Private Snowball reporting, sir!

269
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:11,285
You're fired! Private Joker is promoted
to squad leader!

270
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,079
Disappear, scumbag!

271
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:18,500
Reporting as ordered, sir!

272
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:23,171
From now on Private Joker is your new
squad leader and you bunk with him.

273
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:24,673
He'll teach you!

274
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,550
He'll teach you how to pee!

275
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:31,304
Private Joker is ignorant
but he's got guts, and guts is enough.

276
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,264
Now you ladies carry on.

277
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,692
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

278
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,656
Operating rod handle.

279
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,950
Operating rod guide.

280
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,745
And the left one over the right.

281
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,706
Right one over the left.

282
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,002
Left one over the right.

283
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,546
Right one over the left.

284
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,844
Just throw your other leg over.

285
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:24,439
Pull the next one over
and you're home free.

286
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:34,615
Just throw it over.

287
00:20:42,414 --> 00:20:44,791
That'a boy. Just set it down.

288
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:56,469
Congratulations, Leonard.

289
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,304
You did it.

290
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:02,141
Fold the blanket and sheet back together.

291
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:04,602
Make a four-inch fold.

292
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:07,480
Got it?

293
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:09,148
You do it.

294
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,652
Right shoulder, hut!

295
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,993
Port, hut!

296
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,457
Order, hut!

297
00:21:57,528 --> 00:21:59,196
Square these weapons away.

298
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:07,162
The deadliest weapon in the world...

299
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:10,457
...is a Marine, and his rifle.

300
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,919
It is your killer instinct
that must be harnessed...

301
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:18,298
...if you expect to survive in combat.

302
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:20,925
Your rifle...

303
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:22,635
...is only a tool.

304
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:25,471
It is a hard heart that kills.

305
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:30,976
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

306
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:34,313
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

307
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,690
You will not kill.

308
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,068
You will become dead Marines.

309
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,487
And then you will be in a world of shit.

310
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,366
Because Marines are not allowed...

311
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,368
...to die without permission!

312
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,579
Do you maggots understand?

313
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,543
"I love working for Uncle Sam !

314
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,382
"Lets me know just who I am !

315
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,638
"One, two, three, four!
United States Marine Corps!

316
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,602
"One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!

317
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,231
"My Corps! Your Corps!

318
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,860
"Our Corps! Marine Corps!

319
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,530
"I don't know, but I've been told...

320
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,410
"...Eskimo pussy is mighty cold!

321
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,957
"Mmm, good! Feels good!

322
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,835
"Is good! Real good!

323
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,796
"Tastes good! Mighty good!

324
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,841
"Good for you! Good for me! "

325
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:51,220
Trim 'em !

326
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:55,849
Toe-jam !

327
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:00,687
Pop that blister!

328
00:24:09,863 --> 00:24:11,531
Jesus H. Christ!

329
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:18,163
-Why is your footlocker unlocked?
-Sir, I don't know, sir!

330
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:21,749
If there is one thing
in this world I hate...

331
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,503
...it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, right?

332
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:30,800
Without dickheads like you,
there'd be no thievery in the world!

333
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:32,802
Get down!

334
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:40,142
Now let's just see
if there's anything missing!

335
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,188
Holy Jesus!

336
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:47,607
What is that?

337
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:50,026
What the fuck is that?

338
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:52,696
What is that, Private Pyle?

339
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:54,531
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!

340
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:59,369
-Where did you get it?
-From the mess hall, sir!

341
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:02,038
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Pyle?

342
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,125
Are you allowed to eat
jelly doughnuts, Private?

343
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:10,379
-Why not, Private?
-Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!

344
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:14,508
Because you are a disgusting fatbody,
Private Pyle!

345
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,388
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker?

346
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,431
Because I was hungry, sir!

347
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:23,600
Because you were hungry?

348
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:29,648
Private Pyle...

349
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,943
...has dishonored himself
and dishonored the platoon!

350
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:38,239
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed!

351
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:42,952
I have failed because
you have not helped me!

352
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,413
You people...

353
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,209
...have not given Private Pyle
the proper motivation!

354
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:55,923
From now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

355
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,384
...l will not punish him.

356
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:01,011
I will punish all of you!

357
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,597
And the way I see it, ladies...

358
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:06,558
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut!

359
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:08,643
Get on your faces!

360
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:12,439
Open your mouth!

361
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:15,108
They're paying for it, you eat it!

362
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,902
Ready, exercise!

363
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:20,822
"One, two, three, four!

364
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,408
"I love the Marine Corps! "

365
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,678
You really look like shit today.

366
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:57,732
Everybody hates me now.

367
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,362
Even you.

368
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,950
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

369
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:12,705
You just keep making mistakes,
getting everybody in trouble.

370
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,419
I can't do anything right.

371
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:22,965
I need help.

372
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm trying to help you.

373
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:32,682
I'm really trying.

374
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,020
Tuck your shirt in.

375
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:35,175
Do it.

376
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,729
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

377
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,695
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

378
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:42,156
Semper fi, do or die!

379
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,533
Gung ho, gung ho!

380
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:46,868
What makes the grass grow?

381
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,954
Blood, blood, blood.

382
00:30:49,204 --> 00:30:51,790
What do we do for a living, ladies?

383
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:53,792
Kill, kill, kill!

384
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,502
I can't hear you!

385
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:57,378
Kill, kill, kill!

386
00:30:57,587 --> 00:31:00,381
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!

387
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:02,467
Kill, kill, kill!

388
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:06,220
Do any of you know
who Charles Whitman was?

389
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:10,599
None of you dumbasses knows?

390
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:18,023
Sir, he shot all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!

391
00:31:18,273 --> 00:31:20,776
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

392
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:24,821
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas...

393
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:28,158
...from distances of up to 400 yards.

394
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:31,536
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

395
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,166
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!

396
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:39,002
And do you know how far away he was?

397
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:42,880
Sir, it was far! From that
book suppository building, sir!

398
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,174
Knock it off!

399
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,593
250 feet!

400
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,764
He was 250 feet away and shooting
at a moving target.

401
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:54,058
He got off three rounds...

402
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:57,478
...with an Italian bolt-action rifle
in six seconds...

403
00:31:58,228 --> 00:32:00,856
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot!

404
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,066
Do any of you know where...

405
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,444
...these individuals learned to shoot?

406
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:10,574
Sir, in the Marines, sir!

407
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,577
In the Marines! Outstanding!
Those individuals...

408
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:17,956
...showed what one motivated Marine
and his rifle can do!

409
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,209
Before you ladies leave my island...

410
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:24,087
...you will all be able
to do the same thing!

411
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:28,924
"Happy birthday to you

412
00:32:33,596 --> 00:32:38,308
"Happy birthday, dear Jesus"

413
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:45,941
Today...

414
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,068
...is Christmas!

415
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,906
There will be a magic show at 0930!

416
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:57,619
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

417
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,956
...about how the free world
will conquer Communism...

418
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:06,544
...with the aid of God and a few Marines!

419
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:11,298
God has a hard-on for Marines...

420
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:16,011
...because we kill everything we see!

421
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:18,847
He plays His games...

422
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,266
...we play ours!

423
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:26,688
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

424
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,858
...we keep heaven packed...

425
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,319
...with fresh souls!

426
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:37,115
God was here before the Marine Corps!

427
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,410
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

428
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,455
...but your ass belongs to the Corps!

429
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,874
Do you ladies understand?

430
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,044
I can't hear you!

431
00:33:57,926 --> 00:34:00,387
It's been swabbed and brushed.

432
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:03,807
Everything...

433
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:06,393
...is clean.

434
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:12,107
Beautiful.

435
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:16,528
So that it slides perfectly.

436
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:20,448
Nice.

437
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,452
Everything cleaned...

438
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:26,954
...oiled.

439
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:32,084
So that your action is beautiful.

440
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,132
Smooth, Charlene.

441
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:03,114
Leonard talks to his rifle.

442
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,461
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.

443
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:21,256
I think Leonard's a Section 8.

444
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:27,095
It don't surprise me.

445
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:40,733
I want to slip my tubesteak
into your sister.

446
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:46,322
What will you take in trade?

447
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:50,451
What do you got?

448
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:06,675
Outstanding!

449
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:09,845
We've finally found something you do well!

450
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,310
What is your 6th general order?

451
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:21,439
Sir, to receive, obey and pass on
to the sentry who relieves me...

452
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:23,983
...all orders....

453
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:26,194
Sir, the 6th general....

454
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:28,863
The private does not know, sir!

455
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:32,241
You slimy scumbag,
get down and give me 25!

456
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:41,083
How many counts in that movement?

457
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,459
Sir, four, sir!

458
00:36:42,543 --> 00:36:44,419
Why look down in the chamber?

459
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:48,715
Sir, to be sure the inspecting officer
is not given a loaded weapon, sir!

460
00:36:48,924 --> 00:36:50,175
What's your 5th general order?

461
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:54,262
Sir, to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir!

462
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:56,723
What's this weapon's name?

463
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,726
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir!

464
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:02,729
Private, you are definitely
born again hard.

465
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,440
I may even let you serve as a rifleman
in my beloved Corps.

466
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,823
"I don't want no teenage queen!

467
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:19,370
"I just want my M-14!

468
00:37:22,372 --> 00:37:25,000
"If I die in the combat zone

469
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:30,380
"Box me up and ship me home!

470
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:35,969
"Pin my medals upon my chest!

471
00:37:39,097 --> 00:37:41,557
"Tell my mom I've done my best! "

472
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:48,814
Graduation is only a few days away...

473
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:53,486
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

474
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:57,615
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

475
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:03,412
The instructors are proud to see us
growing beyond their control.

476
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:07,207
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

477
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,585
The Marine Corps wants killers.

478
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:14,714
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

479
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,008
Men without fear.

480
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,220
Today...

481
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,557
...you people are no longer maggots.

482
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,936
Today, you are Marines.

483
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:32,314
You are part of a brotherhood.

484
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:36,986
From now on, until the day you die...

485
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,488
...wherever you are...

486
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:42,491
...every Marine is your brother.

487
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:47,079
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

488
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,415
Some of you will not come back.

489
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,168
But always remember this.:

490
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:55,211
Marines die.

491
00:38:55,795 --> 00:38:57,589
That's what we're here for!

492
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,967
But the Marine Corps lives forever.

493
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:05,513
And that means you live forever!

494
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:13,896
0300, Infantry.

495
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,608
0300, Infantry.

496
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,863
1800, Engineers.
You go out and find mines.

497
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,281
Cowboy!

498
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,034
0300, Infantry.

499
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,537
0300, Infantry.

500
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,830
Joker!

501
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:33,707
4212...

502
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,709
...Basic Military Journalism.

503
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,585
You must be shitting me!

504
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,712
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

505
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,006
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

506
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,634
Sir, I wrote for
my high-school newspaper, sir!

507
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:48,304
Christ, you're not a writer,
you're a killer!

508
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,764
A killer, yes, sir!

509
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:50,973
Gomer Pyle!

510
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:58,272
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

511
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,738
Our last night on the island.

512
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,241
I draw fire watch.

513
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,262
Hi, Joker.

514
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:39,619
Are those...

515
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:41,079
...live rounds?

516
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:50,838
7.62 millimeter.

517
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:55,509
Full metal jacket.

518
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:10,690
Leonard, if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

519
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,694
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

520
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,991
I am...

521
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:23,786
...in a world...

522
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,665
...of shit!

523
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:34,004
Left shoulder, hut!

524
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:37,758
Right shoulder, hut!

525
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:41,762
Lock and load.

526
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:47,601
Order, hut!

527
00:42:50,645 --> 00:42:52,272
"This is my rifle!

528
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,191
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine."

529
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:01,906
Get back in your bunks!

530
00:43:02,782 --> 00:43:04,867
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

531
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:09,872
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

532
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:13,209
Why is Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

533
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:16,337
Why is Pyle holding that weapon?

534
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:19,882
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

535
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,302
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform you...

536
00:43:23,427 --> 00:43:27,389
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir!

537
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:38,691
Now listen to me, Private Pyle...

538
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,569
...and listen good.

539
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:44,572
I want that weapon...

540
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,033
...and I want it now!

541
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,871
Place that rifle on the deck
at your feet...

542
00:43:53,122 --> 00:43:55,040
...and step back away from it.

543
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:06,635
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

544
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:11,139
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

545
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,082
Easy, Leonard.

546
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:43,837
Go easy, man.

547
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:13,131
Hey, baby.

548
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:15,842
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

549
00:46:16,885 --> 00:46:18,428
Not just this minute.

550
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:22,432
Well, baby, me so horny.

551
00:46:23,224 --> 00:46:24,642
Me so horny.

552
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:27,311
Me love you long time.

553
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:29,897
You party?

554
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:31,524
Yeah, we might party.

555
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:34,318
-How much?
-$15.

556
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:36,612
$15 for both of us?

557
00:46:36,695 --> 00:46:38,614
No. Each you $15.

558
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:41,366
Me love you long time.

559
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:42,951
Me so horny.

560
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:46,038
$15 too beaucoup.

561
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:48,081
$5 each.

562
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:49,624
Me suckee-suckee.

563
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,960
Me love you too much.

564
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:57,006
$5 is all my mom allows me to spend.

565
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,926
Okay! $10 each.

566
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:02,553
What do we get for $10?

567
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:05,598
Everything you want.

568
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:07,642
Everything?

569
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:14,523
Buddy, you feel like spending some
of your hard-earned money?

570
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:20,654
Half of these gook whores are officers
in the Viet Cong.

571
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:23,156
The other half have TB.

572
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:26,493
Be sure you only fuck
the ones who cough.

573
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:17,792
That sucker really had some moves on him.

574
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:25,007
You know what pisses me off
about these people?

575
00:48:26,926 --> 00:48:30,096
We're helping them
and they shit all over us.

576
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:32,264
I just can't feature that.

577
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:35,267
Don't take it too hard.
It's just business.

578
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,731
I hate Da Nang.
I want to go out into the field.

579
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:45,986
I'm here three months and all I do is take
handshake shots at award ceremonies.

580
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:49,656
You'd get wasted the first day
and it would be my fault.

581
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:52,075
A high-school girl could do my job.

582
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:54,077
I want to get into the shit.

583
00:48:54,202 --> 00:48:55,912
I want some trigger time.

584
00:48:57,914 --> 00:49:02,377
If you get killed, your mom will find me
and beat the shit out of me.

585
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:04,837
That's a negative.

586
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:12,178
Let's keep it short and sweet.
Anybody got anything new?

587
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:18,183
Rumor has it that the Tet ceasefire
will be cancelled.

588
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:20,561
Rear echelon paranoia.

589
00:49:20,853 --> 00:49:24,815
Intelligence says Charlie might try
something big during Tet.

590
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:27,526
They say the same thing every year.

591
00:49:27,734 --> 00:49:29,611
There's a lot of talk about it.

592
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:31,571
Don't lose any sleep over it.

593
00:49:31,696 --> 00:49:35,533
The Tet holiday is like July Fourth,
Christmas and New Year in one.

594
00:49:36,034 --> 00:49:39,495
Every zipperhead in the North and South,
will bang gongs...

595
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:41,623
...and bark at the moon.

596
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:46,252
Ann-Margret and entourage
are due next week.

597
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:49,463
I want someone to stick
with her for a few days.

598
00:49:49,547 --> 00:49:51,173
Rafterman, you take it.

599
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:54,301
Get some good low-angle stuff.

600
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:58,222
Don't be obvious, but I want to see fur
and early morning dew.

601
00:49:59,473 --> 00:50:04,561
"Diplomats in Dungarees. Marine
engineers rebuild Dong Phuc villages...."

602
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:08,148
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees.

603
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:11,318
If they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

604
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,278
I'll make a note of it, sir.

605
00:50:14,029 --> 00:50:16,656
"N.V.A. Soldier Deserts
After Reading Pamphlets."

606
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,743
"An N.V.A. regular, who realized
his side would lose...

607
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:23,413
"...deserted after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

608
00:50:23,496 --> 00:50:26,833
That's good, Dave.
But why say, "N.V.A. regular"?

609
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,668
Is there an irregular?

610
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,711
How about N.V.A. soldier?

611
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:32,213
I'll fix it.

612
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:37,760
"The Lawrence Welk Show" will be on TV
in two weeks. Dave, do 100 words on it.

613
00:50:38,844 --> 00:50:40,554
"Not While We're Eating."

614
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:45,350
"N.V.A. learned not to interrupt meals of
Marines on a search-and-destroy mission."

615
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:49,729
We have a new directive from M.A.F.
on search and destroy.

616
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,985
Substitute "sweep and clear"
in place of "search and destroy."

617
00:50:55,026 --> 00:50:56,027
Got it?

618
00:50:56,194 --> 00:50:57,946
Got it. Very catchy.

619
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:00,907
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

620
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:06,954
The kill. The grunts
must have hit something.

621
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:09,165
Didn't see them.

622
00:51:09,915 --> 00:51:12,877
I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

623
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:17,006
Grunts who buy toothbrushes
and deodorant for gooks:

624
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:19,091
"Winning of Hearts And Minds."

625
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,761
And combat action resulting in a kill:
"Winning the War."

626
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:26,556
You must have seen blood trails,
drag marks?

627
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:29,017
It was raining, sir.

628
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:32,062
That's why God passed
the law of probability.

629
00:51:32,395 --> 00:51:35,231
Rewrite it with a happy ending,
say, one kill.

630
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:37,859
A sapper or an officer. Which?

631
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:39,736
Whichever you say.

632
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:42,530
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

633
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:45,074
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

634
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:50,705
You'd like our guys to read
the paper and feel bad?

635
00:51:51,414 --> 00:51:54,750
In case you didn't know,
this is not a popular war.

636
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,294
Our job is to report the news that the...

637
00:51:57,419 --> 00:51:59,880
..."why-are-we-here"
civilian newsmen ignore.

638
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:03,550
Maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

639
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:07,637
You could find more blood trails
and drag marks.

640
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,601
I've had my ass in the grass.
Can't say I liked it much.

641
00:52:13,268 --> 00:52:15,729
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

642
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:19,274
My present duties keep me where I belong:

643
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:21,317
In the rear with the gear.

644
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,452
Tet. The Year of the Monkey.

645
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:34,705
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

646
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:40,002
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

647
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:52,430
I am fucking bored to death, man.

648
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:55,892
I have to get back in the shit.

649
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:59,103
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

650
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:04,358
Joker's so tough, he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

651
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,278
...then ask for seconds.

652
00:53:07,987 --> 00:53:09,488
Listen up, pilgrim.

653
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,243
A day without blood is like
a day without sunshine!

654
00:53:16,495 --> 00:53:20,124
Joker thinks the bad bush is
between old mama-san's legs.

655
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:22,626
He's never been in the shit.

656
00:53:22,835 --> 00:53:25,295
Hard to talk about. Like on Hastings.

657
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:29,382
You weren't on Operation Hastings.
You weren't even in country.

658
00:53:29,508 --> 00:53:33,887
Eat shit and die, you fucking
Spanish-American poge!

659
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:37,432
I was there! I was in the shit
with the grunts.

660
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:41,311
Don't listen to Payback's bullshit,
Rafterman.

661
00:53:41,853 --> 00:53:44,731
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

662
00:53:45,857 --> 00:53:47,441
You listen to Joker.

663
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,068
He knows ti ti.

664
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:50,486
Very little.

665
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,323
He's never been in the shit
'cause he ain't got the stare.

666
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:56,742
The 1,000-yard stare.

667
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,829
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit too long.

668
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:04,208
It's like, it's like you've
really seen beyond.

669
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:06,543
I got it.

670
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:09,754
All field Marines got it.
And you'll have it, too.

671
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:11,464
I will?

672
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,970
How do you stop five blacks
from raping a white chick?

673
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:18,596
Fuck you.

674
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,515
Throw them a basketball.

675
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:26,354
Incoming.

676
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,399
They're outgoing!

677
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:34,904
-That ain't outgoing!
-That ain't outgoing!

678
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:36,572
Now what'd I just say?

679
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:18,404
I hope they're just fucking with us.

680
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:20,406
I ain't ready for this shit.

681
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:15,750
Cease fire!

682
00:56:26,385 --> 00:56:27,595
Cease fire!

683
00:56:39,398 --> 00:56:40,566
The enemy...

684
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:43,360
...has very deceitfully...

685
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:46,488
...taken advantage of the ceasefire...

686
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:50,033
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

687
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:53,703
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

688
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:56,831
But we seem to be the exception.

689
00:56:57,749 --> 00:57:01,878
Charlie has hit every military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

690
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,838
In Saigon...

691
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:08,426
...the United States Embassy has been
overrun by suicide squads.

692
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,639
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

693
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,310
We have reports that a division of N.V.A....

694
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,189
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

695
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,610
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

696
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,404
...the civilian press are
wetting their pants...

697
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,533
...and even Cronkite is going to say
the war is now unwinnable.

698
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,578
In other words...

699
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,957
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we all have to take a bite.

700
00:57:46,879 --> 00:57:49,257
Does this mean Ann-Margret's
not coming?

701
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,932
You go straight up to Phu Bai.

702
00:57:59,266 --> 00:58:01,351
Captain January will need you.

703
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:07,232
And you take off that damn button.

704
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:10,902
You can't get killed
wearing a peace symbol.

705
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:15,407
Permission to go with Joker.

706
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:17,575
Granted.

707
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:20,995
Sir, permission not to take Rafterman.

708
00:58:21,704 --> 00:58:22,997
You still here?

709
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:26,918
Vanish ricky-tick
and take Rafterman with you.

710
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:29,545
You're responsible for him.

711
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,171
Get some! Get some!

712
00:59:33,481 --> 00:59:34,733
Get some, baby!

713
00:59:44,951 --> 00:59:46,494
I've got you, mother!

714
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:54,835
Anyone who runs is a VC.

715
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:57,671
Anyone who stands still...

716
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:00,507
...is a well-disciplined VC.

717
01:00:03,218 --> 01:00:06,179
You guys ought to do a story about me.

718
01:00:07,973 --> 01:00:10,684
Why should we do a story about you?

719
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:13,228
'Cause I'm so fucking good!

720
01:00:13,728 --> 01:00:15,522
That ain't no shit neither.

721
01:00:16,064 --> 01:00:19,984
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

722
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:22,612
And 50 water buffaloes, too.

723
01:00:23,613 --> 01:00:25,239
Them are all certified.

724
01:00:26,574 --> 01:00:29,076
Any women or children?

725
01:00:29,952 --> 01:00:31,037
Sometimes.

726
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:35,332
How can you kill women and children?

727
01:00:36,959 --> 01:00:37,876
Easy.

728
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,421
You just don't lead them so much.

729
01:00:42,422 --> 01:00:43,715
Ain't war hell?

730
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,003
We want to get in the shit.

731
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,880
Down the road. Two-five.

732
01:01:24,963 --> 01:01:26,757
Outstanding! Thanks.

733
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:58,621
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

734
01:01:59,038 --> 01:02:00,622
I got a bro named Cowboy.

735
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:02,124
You people one-one?

736
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:05,002
No, sir. We're reporters
for "Stars and Stripes."

737
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,672
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

738
01:02:08,922 --> 01:02:11,466
He's just down the road
in the platoon area.

739
01:02:11,675 --> 01:02:13,218
May we tag along, sir?

740
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:15,136
No problem. Welcome aboard.

741
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:18,431
I'm Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski.

742
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,017
They call me Mr. Touchdown.

743
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:23,561
I played ball for Notre Dame.

744
01:02:25,271 --> 01:02:27,273
You here to make Cowboy famous?

745
01:02:27,565 --> 01:02:29,025
Never happen, sir.

746
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:32,903
If you came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

747
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:36,490
We got Condition Red and we expect rain.

748
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:39,576
Outstanding. We taking care of business?

749
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:41,703
The N.V.A. are dug in deep.

750
01:02:41,745 --> 01:02:46,166
Hotel Company is working this side
of the river, house by house.

751
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:51,046
Charles has his shit together,
but we're still getting some decent kills.

752
01:02:51,213 --> 01:02:54,924
We heard the N.V.A. executed
a lot of gook civilians.

753
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:57,010
Affirmative.

754
01:02:57,385 --> 01:03:01,014
I saw bodies half a klick
this side of the canal.

755
01:03:01,347 --> 01:03:02,932
Can you show me where?

756
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:32,669
The dead have been covered with lime.

757
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:36,631
The dead know only one thing.:

758
01:03:38,091 --> 01:03:39,843
It is better to be alive.

759
01:03:51,187 --> 01:03:54,064
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

760
01:03:54,648 --> 01:03:56,150
What outfit are you with?

761
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,193
We're from "Stars and Stripes."

762
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:02,573
I'm Sergeant Joker
and this photographer is Rafterman.

763
01:04:03,115 --> 01:04:05,450
I'm Lt. Cleves. Hartford, Connecticut.

764
01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:07,411
Have you got a body count, sir?

765
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:08,453
Twenty.

766
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:10,622
How did it happen, sir?

767
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:14,084
The N.V.A. came in
with a list of gook names:

768
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:19,088
Government officials, policemen,
ARVN officers, teachers.

769
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:24,469
They asked them, real polite, to report
the next day for political re-education.

770
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:28,264
Everybody who turned up got shot.

771
01:04:28,556 --> 01:04:30,182
Some they buried alive.

772
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,607
What is that button on your body armor?

773
01:04:39,316 --> 01:04:40,526
A peace symbol, sir.

774
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:43,237
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

775
01:04:43,654 --> 01:04:45,614
What is written on your helmet?

776
01:04:45,656 --> 01:04:47,157
"Born to Kill," sir.

777
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:50,410
You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

778
01:04:50,494 --> 01:04:52,454
Is that some kind of sick joke?

779
01:04:53,663 --> 01:04:55,373
Well, what does it mean?

780
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:58,668
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know very much.

781
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:02,297
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will shit on you!

782
01:05:03,047 --> 01:05:06,134
Answer my question
or you'll stand tall before the Man.

783
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:09,804
I was referring to the duality of man, sir.

784
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,140
The duality of man.
The Jungian thing, sir.

785
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:16,810
-Whose side are you on?
-Our side, sir.

786
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:18,854
-Don't you love your country?
-Yes, sir.

787
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:22,900
Then get with the program. Jump on
the team and come in for the big win.

788
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:28,405
I ask that my Marines obey my orders
as they would the word of God.

789
01:05:29,114 --> 01:05:32,200
We are helping the Vietnamese,
because inside every gook...

790
01:05:32,284 --> 01:05:34,494
...is an American trying to get out.

791
01:05:35,161 --> 01:05:36,955
It's a hardball world, son.

792
01:05:37,038 --> 01:05:40,250
We must keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

793
01:05:53,554 --> 01:05:56,015
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

794
01:05:56,056 --> 01:05:57,433
Around the back.

795
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:08,568
-First Platoon?
-Through there.

796
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,677
Hey, Lone Ranger.

797
01:06:39,473 --> 01:06:40,557
Holy shit!

798
01:06:48,231 --> 01:06:52,360
I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit!

799
01:06:53,695 --> 01:06:55,071
What's happening?

800
01:06:55,405 --> 01:06:59,325
Just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

801
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:00,785
Why go back?

802
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,620
Here or there, samey-same.

803
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:04,580
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

804
01:07:04,622 --> 01:07:08,084
Better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

805
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,170
Hey, you hogs, listen up!

806
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:15,257
This is my bro, Joker, from the island.
And this is....

807
01:07:17,635 --> 01:07:20,471
They're from "Stars and Stripes."
You'll be famous.

808
01:07:22,097 --> 01:07:25,809
We're the Lusthog squad.
We're lifetakers and heartbreakers.

809
01:07:26,852 --> 01:07:29,563
We shoot holes in them
and fill them with lead.

810
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:36,611
Are you a photographer?

811
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,990
I'm a combat correspondent.

812
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:44,535
You seen much combat?

813
01:07:47,788 --> 01:07:49,957
I've seen a little on TV.

814
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:56,338
You're a real comedian.

815
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,426
Well, they call me the Joker.

816
01:08:02,553 --> 01:08:04,513
Well, I've got a joke for you.

817
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:07,516
I'm going to tear you a new asshole.

818
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:13,063
Well, pilgrim...

819
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:18,109
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit!

820
01:08:24,532 --> 01:08:25,908
You talk the talk.

821
01:08:27,535 --> 01:08:29,161
Do you walk the walk?

822
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:36,585
You might not believe it...

823
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:40,714
...but under fire, Animal Mother
is a truly fine human being.

824
01:08:41,882 --> 01:08:45,093
He just needs grenades thrown
at him the rest of his life.

825
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,522
Jungle bunny. Thank God
for the sickle cell, huh?

826
01:08:58,523 --> 01:08:59,732
Yeah, Mother.

827
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:02,860
Hey, photographer!

828
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:06,614
Want to take a good picture?

829
01:09:09,909 --> 01:09:11,035
Take this.

830
01:09:20,294 --> 01:09:21,962
This...is my bro.

831
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:34,099
This is his party.

832
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:36,684
He's the guest of honor.

833
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,896
Today is his birthday.

834
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:43,149
Happy birthday, zipperhead!

835
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:47,028
I will never forget this day.

836
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:51,699
The day I came to Hue city
and fought one million N.V.A. gooks.

837
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:55,953
I really love the little Commie bastards.

838
01:09:57,288 --> 01:10:00,749
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

839
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,586
These are great days we're living!

840
01:10:06,588 --> 01:10:09,633
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

841
01:10:11,426 --> 01:10:13,595
These people we wasted here today...

842
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,765
...are the finest people we will ever know.

843
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:23,271
Once we rotate back to the world, we'll
miss not having anyone worth shooting.

844
01:12:00,072 --> 01:12:02,699
Delta 6 Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

845
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:15,003
We are receiving incoming fire
from the ville.

846
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,130
The lieutenant is down.

847
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:19,883
We'll stop and check out
what's in front of us.

848
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:27,723
Okay, Lusthog squad, listen up!

849
01:12:28,808 --> 01:12:30,726
We'll move up these two roads.

850
01:12:30,768 --> 01:12:32,937
I want the third team up this road.

851
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:36,565
First and second team behind me
up this other road.

852
01:12:37,942 --> 01:12:39,860
Let's go! Let's get it done!

853
01:17:08,034 --> 01:17:10,911
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

854
01:17:11,245 --> 01:17:14,248
Start the cameras.
This is "Vietnam: The Movie"!

855
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,667
If Joker is John Wayne, I'm a horse!

856
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,545
-T.H.E. Rock can be a rock!
-I'll be Ann-Margret!

857
01:17:19,628 --> 01:17:21,630
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

858
01:17:21,713 --> 01:17:24,341
-I'll be General Custer!
-Who'll be the Indian?

859
01:17:24,424 --> 01:17:26,969
We'll let the gooks play the Indians!

860
01:18:05,589 --> 01:18:07,174
You're going home now.

861
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:12,679
Semper fi.

862
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,059
We're mean Marines, sir.

863
01:18:22,355 --> 01:18:23,606
Go easy, bros.

864
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:30,071
Better you than me.

865
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:36,577
At least they died for a good cause.

866
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,371
What cause was that?

867
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:42,666
Freedom.

868
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:46,128
Flush out your head gear, New Guy.

869
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:50,966
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

870
01:18:52,509 --> 01:18:54,302
This is a slaughter.

871
01:18:56,012 --> 01:18:58,598
If I get my balls blown off for a word...

872
01:19:00,683 --> 01:19:02,518
...my word is "poontang."

873
01:19:06,314 --> 01:19:08,107
Tough break for Hand Job.

874
01:19:09,984 --> 01:19:12,570
He was set to get shipped out
on a medical.

875
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:16,615
What was wrong with him?

876
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:21,370
He was jerking off ten times a day.

877
01:19:23,747 --> 01:19:26,458
It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

878
01:19:29,002 --> 01:19:33,381
Last week he was sent to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

879
01:19:34,841 --> 01:19:37,927
The crazy fucker jerks off
in the waiting room.

880
01:19:39,429 --> 01:19:41,097
Instant Section 8.

881
01:19:42,765 --> 01:19:45,476
He was waiting for his papers
to clear division.

882
01:19:48,688 --> 01:19:49,689
Ready?

883
01:19:49,981 --> 01:19:51,023
Turnover.

884
01:19:53,109 --> 01:19:55,319
Hue city interviews. Roll 34.

885
01:19:59,448 --> 01:20:02,743
This is a major city,
so we have to assault with...

886
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,579
...tanks in the streets.

887
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:07,873
They send us in first squad...

888
01:20:07,956 --> 01:20:10,792
...to make sure there are no little, uh...

889
01:20:12,794 --> 01:20:15,839
...Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

890
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:20,552
So we roll the tanks in and basically,
blow the place to hell.

891
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:24,430
When we're in Hue, in Hue city...

892
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,558
...it's like a war, you know.

893
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:33,439
Like what I thought about, what I
thought a war was supposed to be.

894
01:20:36,692 --> 01:20:38,611
There's the enemy, kill them.

895
01:20:39,445 --> 01:20:42,114
There's no question about it.
We're the best.

896
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:47,077
It's bullshit about Air Cav. When
the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

897
01:20:47,327 --> 01:20:49,996
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine!

898
01:20:50,997 --> 01:20:53,291
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

899
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:57,587
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam,
I'll tell you that.

900
01:20:58,755 --> 01:21:00,215
Can I quote L.B.J.?

901
01:21:02,383 --> 01:21:04,135
"I will not send...

902
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:08,472
"...American boys 10,000 miles
around the world...

903
01:21:08,556 --> 01:21:11,809
"...to do a job Asian boys
should be doing for themselves."

904
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,188
Personally, I think...

905
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:19,525
...they don't want to be involved
in this war.

906
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:21,944
I think they sort of...

907
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:27,741
...took away our freedom and gave it
to the gooks. They don't want it.

908
01:21:28,784 --> 01:21:30,869
They'd rather be alive than free.

909
01:21:31,036 --> 01:21:32,621
Poor dumb bastards.

910
01:21:34,205 --> 01:21:37,167
The ones I'm fighting at are some pretty...

911
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,420
...pretty bad boys. I'm not real, uh....

912
01:21:42,046 --> 01:21:43,673
I'm not real keen on...

913
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,510
...these fellows that are supposedly
on our side.

914
01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:51,055
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

915
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:58,771
We get killed for these people
and they don't even appreciate it.

916
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:02,232
They think it's a big joke.

917
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:04,359
If you ask me...

918
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:07,529
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

919
01:22:07,904 --> 01:22:10,866
It depends. I'm here
to take combat photos.

920
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:14,661
But if the shit gets too thick,
I'll go to the rifle.

921
01:22:16,246 --> 01:22:19,124
What do I think of America's involvement
in the war?

922
01:22:19,207 --> 01:22:20,792
I think we should win.

923
01:22:21,584 --> 01:22:22,877
I hate Vietnam.

924
01:22:23,711 --> 01:22:27,215
There's not one horse
in the whole country.

925
01:22:28,257 --> 01:22:30,718
There's something wrong with that.

926
01:22:32,386 --> 01:22:34,388
If they'd send us more guys maybe...

927
01:22:34,472 --> 01:22:37,725
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

928
01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:41,562
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam...

929
01:22:42,104 --> 01:22:44,064
...the jewel of Southeast Asia.

930
01:22:44,731 --> 01:22:45,941
I wanted to meet...

931
01:22:46,024 --> 01:22:49,403
...interesting people of an ancient culture
and kill them.

932
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:55,450
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

933
01:23:20,599 --> 01:23:22,851
'Morning, little schoolgirl.

934
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:25,520
I'm a little schoolboy, too.

935
01:23:28,148 --> 01:23:31,276
-What you got there?
-Do you want No. 1 fuckee?

936
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,322
Any of you boys want
No. 1 fuckee?

937
01:23:35,697 --> 01:23:37,991
I'm so horny I can't even get
a piece of hand!

938
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:39,075
Me want suckee.

939
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:43,997
Suckee, fuckee, she give you everything
you want. Long time.

940
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:46,916
Everything you want! All right!

941
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,334
How much, chief?

942
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:49,669
$15 each.

943
01:23:53,005 --> 01:23:55,007
$15 beaucoup money.

944
01:23:55,883 --> 01:23:56,926
$5 each.

945
01:23:57,426 --> 01:23:59,219
Come on, she love you good.

946
01:23:59,345 --> 01:24:01,555
Boom-boom long time. $10.

947
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:02,681
$5.

948
01:24:02,848 --> 01:24:04,099
No, $10.

949
01:24:04,516 --> 01:24:06,476
Trade you some ARVN rifles.

950
01:24:06,768 --> 01:24:09,146
Never been fired and only dropped once.

951
01:24:10,647 --> 01:24:12,274
Okay, $5. You give me.

952
01:24:16,277 --> 01:24:17,821
Let's get mounted.

953
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:24,535
Something wrong, chief?

954
01:24:24,702 --> 01:24:26,704
She says no boom-boom with you.

955
01:24:26,871 --> 01:24:28,372
What the motherfuck?

956
01:24:28,623 --> 01:24:30,791
She says soul brother too beaucoup.

957
01:24:32,877 --> 01:24:36,547
He's saying you black boys
pack too much meat!

958
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,057
She looks like she could suck
the chrome off a trailer hitch.

959
01:24:47,641 --> 01:24:49,851
She say too beaucoup. Too beaucoup.

960
01:24:50,727 --> 01:24:52,062
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:56,816
What we have here is a magnificent...

962
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,611
...specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

963
01:25:00,236 --> 01:25:02,363
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

964
01:25:03,656 --> 01:25:04,991
Okay. Okay.

965
01:25:11,914 --> 01:25:14,333
-We need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

966
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:17,711
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

967
01:25:17,962 --> 01:25:21,298
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

968
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:28,013
Hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

969
01:25:28,972 --> 01:25:31,475
-I don't want it after you, man!
-Fuck you!

970
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,842
Intelligence passed the word down...

971
01:26:07,009 --> 01:26:10,595
...that during the night the N. V.A.
pulled out of our area...

972
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,139
...to positions across the Perfume River.

973
01:26:13,848 --> 01:26:17,602
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

974
01:26:49,758 --> 01:26:52,469
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!

975
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:17,826
He ain't going to make it.

976
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:31,339
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

977
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,177
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

978
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:41,474
Murph, this is Cowboy.

979
01:27:42,058 --> 01:27:44,352
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

980
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:47,522
Wait one.

981
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:55,446
You're senior NCO. Take charge
and continue with the patrol.

982
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:58,032
Call in at the next checkpoint. Over.

983
01:27:58,449 --> 01:28:00,034
Roger. Understand.

984
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,042
I'm squad leader.

985
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,547
I'll follow you anywhere, scumbag.

986
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:19,302
He's dead.

987
01:29:09,141 --> 01:29:10,226
What's up?

988
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,270
We made a mistake at the last checkpoint.

989
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:15,898
See what you think.

990
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:20,778
I think we're here...

991
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:24,364
...and we should be here.

992
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:27,993
We're here?

993
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:30,620
We should be here?

994
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:46,969
What do you think?

995
01:29:48,888 --> 01:29:51,057
I think we should change direction.

996
01:30:07,864 --> 01:30:09,491
We'll change direction.

997
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,502
What's up?

998
01:30:22,295 --> 01:30:23,796
Change in direction.

999
01:30:24,964 --> 01:30:26,174
Are we lost?

1000
01:30:26,299 --> 01:30:28,259
Joker, shut the fuck up!

1001
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:31,178
Okay, listen up!

1002
01:30:32,013 --> 01:30:33,347
Can you hear me?

1003
01:30:34,265 --> 01:30:36,016
We're changing direction.

1004
01:30:36,267 --> 01:30:38,102
We're heading over that way.

1005
01:30:38,227 --> 01:30:40,646
Eightball's going to find a way through.

1006
01:30:41,897 --> 01:30:42,898
Got it?

1007
01:30:44,942 --> 01:30:46,944
Eightball, let's dance.

1008
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,572
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1009
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:10,482
Cease fire!

1010
01:32:10,774 --> 01:32:12,442
Cease fire, goddamn it!

1011
01:32:12,776 --> 01:32:15,111
Cool it, goddamn it! Cease fire!

1012
01:32:18,573 --> 01:32:22,410
Listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1013
01:32:24,662 --> 01:32:25,788
Negative!

1014
01:32:25,872 --> 01:32:28,708
Save your ammo!
Nobody fire till I tell you!

1015
01:32:32,086 --> 01:32:34,296
No! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1016
01:32:34,713 --> 01:32:36,257
Animal, cease fire!

1017
01:32:36,549 --> 01:32:38,217
It's Sergeant Murphy.

1018
01:32:38,926 --> 01:32:40,427
Cowboy. Over.

1019
01:32:40,511 --> 01:32:43,680
Murphy. What is your present position?
Over.

1020
01:32:44,181 --> 01:32:46,266
Receiving enemy sniper fire.

1021
01:32:46,683 --> 01:32:47,976
Eightball is down.

1022
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,896
We're half a klick north
of checkpoint No. 4.

1023
01:32:51,188 --> 01:32:54,691
Possible strong enemy forces in front of us.

1024
01:32:55,025 --> 01:32:57,527
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1025
01:32:58,903 --> 01:33:00,530
Roger. Understand.

1026
01:33:00,613 --> 01:33:02,865
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1027
01:33:05,743 --> 01:33:06,869
Stay close.

1028
01:33:08,746 --> 01:33:12,500
Listen up! I think we're being
set up for an ambush.

1029
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:16,295
There may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings.

1030
01:33:16,712 --> 01:33:18,672
I've requested tank support.

1031
01:33:18,756 --> 01:33:20,174
We'll sit tight...

1032
01:33:20,549 --> 01:33:23,427
...but keep our eyes open.
If they hit us...

1033
01:33:23,594 --> 01:33:25,596
...we'll have to pull back fast.

1034
01:33:27,097 --> 01:33:29,850
Goddamn it! Cease your fire, Mother!

1035
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,768
Cease your fucking fire!

1036
01:33:32,769 --> 01:33:34,187
We can't leave him !

1037
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:36,898
We'll get him when the tank comes up.

1038
01:33:37,023 --> 01:33:39,442
He's hit three times! He can't wait!

1039
01:33:39,901 --> 01:33:44,489
That sniper's just trying
to suck us in one at a time.

1040
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:49,493
Goddamn it! No!

1041
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,246
Goddamn it, cease fire!

1042
01:33:53,706 --> 01:33:55,749
Fuck this shit!
I'm going in to bring him out!

1043
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:58,335
Sit the fuck down, goddamn it!

1044
01:34:15,185 --> 01:34:17,645
Okay, cease fire! He's there!

1045
01:34:33,494 --> 01:34:34,954
Hold your fire!

1046
01:34:35,162 --> 01:34:36,497
Hold your fire!

1047
01:34:37,414 --> 01:34:39,750
You can't see the sniper!

1048
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:43,587
Save the ammo! Nobody fire
till I tell you! Nobody!

1049
01:34:49,926 --> 01:34:51,261
Hold your fire!

1050
01:34:52,429 --> 01:34:54,222
What the fuck do we do now?

1051
01:34:56,141 --> 01:34:57,934
Give me that fucking radio.

1052
01:35:02,355 --> 01:35:04,273
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1053
01:35:06,859 --> 01:35:11,155
We're in deep shit. Two men down.
What's the story on the tank? Over.

1054
01:35:13,282 --> 01:35:14,450
Sorry, Cowboy.

1055
01:35:14,492 --> 01:35:16,452
No luck so far with the tank.

1056
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:18,412
Will advise. Over.

1057
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,251
Numb-nut bastards.

1058
01:35:25,002 --> 01:35:26,378
Okay, listen up!

1059
01:35:29,006 --> 01:35:30,715
Can't wait for the tank.

1060
01:35:31,299 --> 01:35:33,218
They're going to hit us any minute.

1061
01:35:33,301 --> 01:35:35,387
When they do, we won't have time.

1062
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,223
We have to pull out now. Get ready.

1063
01:35:39,766 --> 01:35:41,142
Wait! Hold it!

1064
01:35:41,601 --> 01:35:43,144
Nobody's pulling out!

1065
01:35:43,436 --> 01:35:45,438
There's only one fucking sniper!

1066
01:35:45,521 --> 01:35:46,522
Back off!

1067
01:35:46,981 --> 01:35:49,775
I'm calling the plays and I say we pull out!

1068
01:35:49,984 --> 01:35:51,861
What about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1069
01:35:51,944 --> 01:35:55,656
It's shitty, but we can't refuse
to accept the situation.

1070
01:35:55,865 --> 01:35:58,325
We're not leaving them out there!

1071
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:00,119
They're wasted!

1072
01:36:00,536 --> 01:36:01,829
You know that!

1073
01:36:02,246 --> 01:36:04,414
Come on, we gotta bring them back.

1074
01:36:04,623 --> 01:36:05,874
Let's do it!

1075
01:36:06,124 --> 01:36:08,251
Stand down! That's a direct order.

1076
01:36:12,547 --> 01:36:15,467
Fuck you, Cowboy!
Fuck all you assholes!

1077
01:36:18,803 --> 01:36:19,888
Goddamn it!

1078
01:36:19,971 --> 01:36:21,639
Fucking son of a bitch!

1079
01:36:22,056 --> 01:36:23,641
You motherfucker!

1080
01:36:44,953 --> 01:36:46,413
Where's the sniper?

1081
01:36:49,916 --> 01:36:52,252
Doc, where's the sniper?

1082
01:37:01,719 --> 01:37:02,637
Shit!

1083
01:37:05,056 --> 01:37:06,766
Shit! Fuck!

1084
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:02,736
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!

1085
01:38:04,446 --> 01:38:06,698
There's only one sniper!

1086
01:38:08,283 --> 01:38:11,119
Move up the squad!
You're clear up to here!

1087
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,501
Son of a bitch.

1088
01:38:26,676 --> 01:38:30,513
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
come with me. We'll take a look.

1089
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:33,557
You stay put and cover our ass!

1090
01:38:33,933 --> 01:38:35,935
We may come back in a big hurry!

1091
01:38:37,728 --> 01:38:39,980
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming, too.

1092
01:38:42,066 --> 01:38:43,067
All set?

1093
01:38:43,817 --> 01:38:44,776
Let's move!

1094
01:39:26,108 --> 01:39:28,402
Top of the building, round the corner.

1095
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:50,047
Give me that radio.

1096
01:39:53,634 --> 01:39:55,219
This is Cowboy. Over.

1097
01:40:06,438 --> 01:40:09,649
Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot
through the hole!

1098
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,415
That son of a bitch!

1099
01:40:25,456 --> 01:40:26,916
You'll be all right.

1100
01:40:26,999 --> 01:40:29,335
Don't shit me, Joker!

1101
01:40:30,836 --> 01:40:33,130
I'm not. You're my favorite turd.

1102
01:40:40,971 --> 01:40:42,598
Hang on, man! Hang on!

1103
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:48,103
I can hack it.

1104
01:40:55,944 --> 01:40:57,404
I can hack it.

1105
01:41:55,459 --> 01:41:57,169
Let's go get some payback.

1106
01:42:03,967 --> 01:42:04,927
Okay.

1107
01:42:20,817 --> 01:42:22,527
Watch that fucking hole.

1108
01:42:24,153 --> 01:42:25,655
Give them some smoke.

1109
01:42:42,004 --> 01:42:43,172
Ready?

1110
01:43:24,711 --> 01:43:27,422
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1111
01:43:33,553 --> 01:43:35,555
Joker, in there! New Guy!

1112
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,719
We got the sniper!

1113
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:21,881
What's up?

1114
01:46:23,841 --> 01:46:25,385
We got the sniper.

1115
01:46:38,564 --> 01:46:40,065
I saved Joker's ass.

1116
01:46:40,649 --> 01:46:41,984
I got the sniper.

1117
01:46:42,776 --> 01:46:44,903
I fucking blew her away!

1118
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:47,948
Am I bad?

1119
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:51,660
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1120
01:47:10,344 --> 01:47:11,762
What's she saying?

1121
01:47:16,058 --> 01:47:17,309
She's praying.

1122
01:47:21,897 --> 01:47:24,108
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1123
01:47:28,111 --> 01:47:30,238
There's nothing we can do for her.

1124
01:47:32,282 --> 01:47:33,658
She's dead meat.

1125
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:43,293
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1126
01:47:48,005 --> 01:47:49,340
What about her?

1127
01:47:53,678 --> 01:47:54,762
Fuck her.

1128
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:57,806
Let her rot.

1129
01:48:14,781 --> 01:48:16,700
We can't just leave her here.

1130
01:48:20,203 --> 01:48:21,496
Hey, asshole...

1131
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,040
...Cowboy's wasted.

1132
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:27,210
You're fresh out of friends.

1133
01:48:29,045 --> 01:48:30,838
I'm running this squad now.

1134
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:34,050
And I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1135
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:41,098
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1136
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,812
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.

1137
01:48:57,405 --> 01:48:59,741
Shoot...me.

1138
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:03,536
Shoot...

1139
01:49:04,662 --> 01:49:05,705
...me.

1140
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:20,511
If you want to waste her, go on...

1141
01:49:23,555 --> 01:49:24,765
...waste her.

1142
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,498
Shoot.

1143
01:50:42,214 --> 01:50:46,176
We'll have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of...Ugly!

1144
01:50:50,597 --> 01:50:52,099
Hardcore, man.

1145
01:50:54,935 --> 01:50:56,561
Fucking hardcore.

1146
01:51:14,453 --> 01:51:18,541
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1147
01:51:20,084 --> 01:51:24,088
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1148
01:51:33,847 --> 01:51:37,392
"We play fair and we work hard
And we're in harmony

1149
01:51:38,268 --> 01:51:41,980
"M-l-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1150
01:51:47,026 --> 01:51:49,820
"Forever let us hold our banner high

1151
01:51:51,614 --> 01:51:53,532
"Boys and girls from far and near

1152
01:51:53,574 --> 01:51:55,451
"You're welcome as can be

1153
01:51:56,035 --> 01:51:59,872
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1154
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:02,708
"Who's the leader of the club...."

1155
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:07,129
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1156
01:52:07,754 --> 01:52:12,717
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming fuck fantasy.

1157
01:52:14,427 --> 01:52:16,763
I am so happy that I am alive...

1158
01:52:17,305 --> 01:52:19,599
...in one piece, and short.

1159
01:52:21,476 --> 01:52:24,145
I'm in a world of shit, yes.

1160
01:52:24,979 --> 01:52:26,481
But I am alive.

1161
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:28,858
And I am not afraid.

1162
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:00,000
