1
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:38,978
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

2
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:42,216
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

3
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,988
... and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be ""sir.""

4
00:01:46,163 --> 00:01:48,028
Do you maggots understand that?

5
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:49,426
Sir, yes, sir.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,899
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

7
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,435
Sir, yes, sir.

8
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:58,962
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

9
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:00,474
... you will be a weapon.

10
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:03,670
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

11
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,645
But until that day, you are pukes.

12
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:09,183
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

13
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,719
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

14
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:16,781
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

15
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:19,827
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

16
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:22,693
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

17
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,959
I am hard but I am fair.

18
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,399
There is no racial bigotry here.

19
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,701
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

20
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,366
Here, you are all equally worthless.

21
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,503
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

22
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,514
... who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

23
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:42,675
Do you maggots understand that?

24
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,081
Sir, yes, sir.

25
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:45,983
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

26
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:48,147
Sir, yes, sir!

27
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,590
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

28
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:54,318
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

29
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,830
-Do you like that name?
-Sir, yes, sir!

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,696
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

31
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,031
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

32
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,299
... on a daily basis in my mess hall.

33
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,965
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,705
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,575
Who said that?

36
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:13,705
Who the fuck said that?

37
00:03:13,884 --> 00:03:17,342
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

38
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:20,149
... who just signed
his own death warrant?

39
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,516
Nobody, huh?

40
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:26,390
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

41
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:29,157
I will P. T. you all until you fucking die.

42
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,097
I'll P. T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

43
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,124
-Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
-Sir, no, sir.

44
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:38,502
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

45
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:42,031
-Sir, no, sir.
-Sir, I said it, sir.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,903
Well, no shit.

47
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,416
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

48
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,474
I admire your honesty.

49
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:55,113
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

50
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,992
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

51
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,190
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

52
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,597
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

53
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:08,334
Now get up. Get on your feet.

54
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:13,238
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

55
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,766
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

56
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:19,006
-Sir, to kill, sir.
-So you're a killer?

57
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:22,038
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Let me see your war face.

58
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,608
-Sir?
-You've got a war face?

59
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,620
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

60
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:34,321
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

61
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:37,088
You don't scare me. Work on it.

62
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,859
Sir, yes, sir!

63
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,298
What's your excuse?

64
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,835
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

65
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:44,838
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

66
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,033
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Well, thank you very much.

67
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,771
-Can I be in charge for a while?
-Sir, yes, sir.

68
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:53,075
-Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
-Sir, I am, sir.

69
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,309
-Do I make you nervous?
-Sir....

70
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:58,181
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

71
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:00,687
-Sir, no, sir.
-How tall are you, private?

72
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,348
Sir, 5'9"", sir.

73
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:05,290
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

74
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:07,760
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

75
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,923
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...

76
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:14,832
... ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

77
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:16,335
I think you've been cheated.

78
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:18,604
Where the hell are you from, private?

79
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,266
-Sir, Texas, sir.
-Holy dogshit. Texas?

80
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,505
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

81
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:28,173
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

82
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,343
-Do you suck dicks?
-Sir, no, sir.

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,818
-Are you a peter puffer?
-Sir, no, sir.

84
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,413
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:39,221
... and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

86
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,489
I'll be watching you.

87
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,259
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

88
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,665
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I'll bet they regret that.

89
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:50,762
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

90
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:53,535
-What's your name, fat-body?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

91
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,405
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:59,208
-Sir, no, sir.
-That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

93
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:01,339
-Sir, no, sir.
-Do you suck dicks?

94
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:04,442
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

95
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,577
-... through a garden hose.
-Sir, no, sir.

96
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,190
I don't like the name Lawrence.

97
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,485
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

98
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,289
-From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

99
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:16,125
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

100
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,394
-Sir, no, sir.
-Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

101
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,457
Sir, yes, sir.

102
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,765
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

103
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:27,631
-Sir, I'm trying, sir.
-Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

104
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,904
... exactly three fucking seconds...

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,640
... to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

106
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:36,809
... or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

107
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,512
One. Two. Three.

108
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,320
-Sir, I can't help it, sir.
-Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

109
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,026
Now choke yourself.

110
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,258
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

111
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:56,464
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

112
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,473
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

113
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,472
-Are you through grinning?
-Sir, yes, sir.

114
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,207
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

115
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:09,582
Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:13,575
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

117
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,554
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,615
That's enough. Get on your feet.

119
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,194
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

120
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,964
... or I will definitely fuck you up.

121
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,095
Sir, yes, sir.

122
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,699
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

123
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,211
Left, right, left, right, left.

124
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:40,009
Left, right, left, right, left....

125
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:42,811
Parris Island, South Carolina...

126
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:46,217
... the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

127
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,019
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

128
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:53,026
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

129
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,960
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

130
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,966
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

131
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:01,502
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

132
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:04,595
-Oh, give me some, give me some
-Oh, give me some, give me some

133
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,072
-P. T.
-P. T.

134
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:07,574
-P. T.
-P. T.

135
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,075
-Good for you
-Good for you

136
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:10,736
-And good for me
-And good for me

137
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,178
-Good
-Good

138
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,079
Up in the morning to the rising sun

139
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:17,743
Up in the morning to the rising sun

140
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,685
Gonna run all day till the running's done

141
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:23,985
Gonna run all day till the running's done

142
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,994
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

143
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,587
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

144
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,655
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

145
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:35,896
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

146
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:39,600
Left, right, left, right, left.

147
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:42,700
Your left shoulder.

148
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:46,741
Left, right, left. Port.

149
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:51,717
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

150
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,585
Left shoulder.

151
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:01,426
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

152
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:04,123
-Sir, I don't know, sir.
-You are dumb, Private Pyle...

153
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:07,566
... but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

154
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:10,103
-Sir, no, sir.
-Then you did that on purpose.

155
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:13,162
-You wanna be different.
-Sir, no, sir.

156
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:16,232
-What side was that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, left side, sir.

157
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:19,940
-Are you sure, Private Pyle?
-Sir, yes, sir.

158
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,678
-What side was that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, right side, sir.

159
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,220
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

160
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,016
Pick up your fucking cover.

161
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,419
Sir, yes, sir.

162
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:32,426
Your left shoulder.

163
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:36,661
Left, right, left. Port.

164
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,695
Left shoulder.

165
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,196
Your right shoulder.

166
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:51,366
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

167
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,277
Left, two, three, four.

168
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:57,977
Your right shoulder.

169
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:04,750
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

170
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:08,420
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

171
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:13,797
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

172
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,430
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

173
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:22,772
... through her purty pink panties
are over.

174
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,005
You're married to this piece.

175
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:27,844
This weapon of iron and wood.

176
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,215
And you will be faithful.

177
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,751
Arms.

178
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:38,123
Prepare to mount.

179
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,656
Mount.

180
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:50,030
Port.

181
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:56,106
Pray.

182
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,838
This is my rifle.

183
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:02,507
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

184
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:05,348
My rifle is my best friend.

185
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,183
It is my life.

186
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:11,646
I must master it
as I must master my life.

187
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:14,786
Without me, my rifle is useless.

188
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,820
Without my rifle, I am useless.

189
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:20,865
I must fire my rifle true.

190
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:25,064
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

191
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:28,200
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

192
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:29,902
I will.

193
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,742
Before God, I swear this creed.

194
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,613
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

195
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:39,050
We are the masters of our enemy.

196
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:41,713
We are the saviors of my life.

197
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:46,090
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

198
00:11:46,263 --> 00:11:47,958
Amen.

199
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:50,292
Arm.

200
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,765
At ease.

201
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:58,163
Good night, ladies.

202
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,970
Good night, sir.

203
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,938
-Hit it, sweetheart.
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:07,269
Right shoulder.

205
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:15,042
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

206
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,424
Left shoulder.

207
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:27,092
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

208
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,768
Port.

209
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,605
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

210
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:40,741
This is my rifle, this is my gun

211
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:43,408
This is for fighting, this is for fun

212
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:46,009
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,578
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,249
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,851
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,453
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,056
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,601
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:04,535
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:11,442
You ' re bouncing.

221
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,492
T en fucking seconds.

222
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:33,523
It should take you no less than 1 0
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

223
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:35,193
Quickly, move it out.

224
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:39,000
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

225
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:43,441
... until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 1 0 fucking seconds.

226
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,927
Next two privates. Quickly.

227
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,869
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

228
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,100
Next two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:15,642
Hurry up. Get up there.

230
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:18,508
-Private Joker, are you a killer?
-Sir, yes, sir.

231
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,546
Let me hear your war cry.

232
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,448
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

233
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:26,748
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

234
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:28,652
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

235
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:32,716
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

236
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:37,390
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

237
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,297
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

238
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,665
-Sir, yes, sir.
-What is the matter with you?

239
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,037
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

240
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,905
-Couldn't you?
-Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,276
Your ass looks like about 1 50 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

242
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,883
Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,619
One for the commandant.

244
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,816
One for the Corps.

245
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:06,757
Get up there. Pull.

246
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:10,628
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

247
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,826
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

248
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,528
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

249
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:20,301
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

250
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:24,140
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

251
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:28,671
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

252
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:30,843
Get up there, Snowball.

253
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,650
Get up here, fat-boy.

254
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:37,088
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

255
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,458
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

256
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,930
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

257
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:48,628
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

258
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:51,000
That would break my fucking heart.

259
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:54,632
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

260
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:58,338
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

261
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:02,246
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,943
Are you quitting on me?

263
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,146
Well, are you?

264
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:11,612
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

265
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:14,285
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

266
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,194
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

267
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,562
Now. Move it.

268
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:25,094
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

269
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,903
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

270
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:32,673
... if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

271
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:36,277
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

272
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:38,511
Quickly. Move it out.

273
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:43,284
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

274
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,791
Or did you have to work on it?

275
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:49,557
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

276
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:54,294
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

277
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,028
Move it.

278
00:16:56,205 --> 00:17:00,369
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

279
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,568
Do it now.

280
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:06,203
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

281
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,843
Do you feel dizzy?

282
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,351
Do you feel faint?

283
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:18,049
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

284
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:23,688
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

285
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,390
Get up here.

286
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:29,231
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

287
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,363
Quickly.

288
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:35,329
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

289
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:51,591
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

290
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:53,626
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

291
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,685
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

292
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,255
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

293
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:02,359
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

294
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:03,937
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

295
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:05,665
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:09,403
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

297
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,639
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-I want that head so sanitary...

298
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:16,876
... that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

299
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,418
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

300
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,818
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

301
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,787
Sir, no, sir.

302
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:29,658
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

303
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:32,027
Sir, the private said, "" No, sir,"" sir.

304
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:35,364
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

305
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:39,702
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

306
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:42,071
... or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

307
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,577
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

308
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,009
Sir, negative, sir.

309
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:48,673
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

310
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,182
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:53,413
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

312
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,480
... and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

313
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,218
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

314
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:02,228
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

315
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,286
Private Snowball.

316
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:07,095
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

317
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,967
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

318
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,563
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Disappear, scumbag.

319
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:16,473
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Private Pyle.

320
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,570
-Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
-From now on...

321
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:23,048
... Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

322
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,516
He'll teach you everything.

323
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,882
-He'll teach you how to pee.
-Sir, yes, sir.

324
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:31,152
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

325
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,056
Now, you ladies, carry on.

326
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,424
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

327
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:45,396
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

328
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:51,141
Operating-rod handle.

329
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,805
Operating-rod guide.

330
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:57,448
And the left one over the right.

331
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,713
Right one over the left.

332
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,389
Left one over the right.

333
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,824
The right one over the left.

334
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,630
Just throw your other leg over.

335
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
Attaboy.

336
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,201
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

337
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,707
Ready?

338
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,711
Just throw it over.

339
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,359
Attaboy.

340
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,497
Set it down.

341
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:49,827
All right?

342
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:52,861
There you go.

343
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:56,672
Congratulations, Leonard.

344
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:58,438
You did it.

345
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:02,240
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

346
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:04,750
Make a four-inch fold.

347
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:07,615
Okay? Got it?

348
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,678
You do it.

349
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:13,552
Right shoulder.

350
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:15,822
Your left shoulder.

351
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:20,997
Port.

352
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,305
Order.

353
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:52,824
Your right shoulder.

354
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,832
Square these weapons away.

355
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:01,863
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the....

356
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:07,309
The deadliest weapon in the world...

357
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:11,340
... is a Marine and his rifle.

358
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,012
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

359
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:19,252
... if you expect to survive in combat.

360
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:22,955
Your rifle is only a tool.

361
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:25,692
It is a hard heart that kills.

362
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:31,326
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

363
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:34,533
... you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

364
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,701
You will not kill.

365
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:39,245
You will become dead-Marine.

366
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:42,748
And then you will be in a world of shit.

367
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,648
Because Marines...

368
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,415
... are not allowed to die
without permission.

369
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,252
Do you maggots understand?

370
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:51,950
Sir, yes, sir.

371
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:56,327
I love working for Uncle Sam

372
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:59,263
I love working for Uncle Sam

373
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:02,199
Lets me know just who I am

374
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:05,169
Lets me know just who I am

375
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:08,174

384
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:29,284
I don 't know, but I've been told

385
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:32,229
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

386
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:35,199
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

387
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:36,702
-Good

388

00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:47,314
-Good for me
-Good for me

395
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,409
Trim them.

396
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,153
Toe jam.

397
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:00,893
Pop that blister.

398
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:12,461
Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:16,640
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

400
00:24:16,812 --> 00:24:17,972
Sir, I don't know, sir.

401
00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:21,605
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

402
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:25,083
... it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

403
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:27,814
-Sir, yes, sir.
-lf it wasn't for dickheads like you...

404
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,550
... there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

405
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,682
-Sir, no, sir.
-Get down.

406
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:40,888
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

407
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:45,667
Holy Jesus.

408
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:47,638
What is that?

409
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,404
What the fuck is that?

410
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,274
What is that, Private Pyle?

411
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:53,710
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

412
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:56,249
-A jelly doughnut?
-Sir, yes, sir.

413
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,479
-How did it get here?
-Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

414
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:01,782
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

415
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:05,688
-Sir, no, sir.
-Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

416
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,227
-Sir, no, sir.
-And why not, Private Pyle?

417
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:10,058
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

418
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:15,260
-Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
-Sir, yes, sir.

419
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:18,999
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

420
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:21,131
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

421
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,404
Because you were hungry.

422
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,605
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

423
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:34,415
... and dishonored the platoon.

424
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,549
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

425
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:43,619
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

426
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,860
You people have not given Private Pyle...

427
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:50,232
... the proper motivation.

428
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,900
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

429
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:58,342
... I will not punish him.

430
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:01,005
I will punish all of you.

431
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,243
And the way I see it, ladies...

432
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,479
... you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

433
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:09,351
Now get on your faces.

434
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,488
Open your mouth.

435
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:15,152
They're paying for it, you eat it.

436
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,697
Ready, exercise.

437
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,495
One, two, three, four

438
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,160
I love the Marine Corps

439
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,705
One, two, three, four

440
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,264
I love the Marine Corps

441
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:30,867
One, two, three, four

442
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,378
I love the Marine Corps

443
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:36,040
One, two, three, four

444
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,550
I love the Marine Corps

445
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:41,087
One, two, three, four....

446
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:45,282
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

447
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:53,363
Joker.

448
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:58,535
Everybody hates me now.

449
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:02,941
Even you.

450
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:08,313
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

451
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:10,979
You just keep making mistakes.

452
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,451
Getting everybody in trouble.

453
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:18,918
I can't do anything right.

454
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,352
I need help.

455
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,234
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

456
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:33,100
I'm really trying.

457
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,404
Tuck your shirt in.

458
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,806
One, two, three, 1 9.

459
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:46,011
One, two, three, 20.

460
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:48,247
One, two, three, 21.

461
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,449
One, two, three, 22.

462
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,548
One, two, three, 23.

463
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:54,753
One, two, three, 24.

464
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,921
One, two, three, 25.

465
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,987
One, two, three, 26.

466
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:01,193
One, two, three, 27.

467
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,361
One, two, three, 28.

468
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,461
One, two, three, 29.

469
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:08,132
One, two, three, 30.

470
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:35,419
Do it.

471
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:36,792
Do it.

472
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:49,271
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

473
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:19,404
Port.

474
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:23,634
Left shoulder.

475
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:28,645
Right shoulder.

476
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:33,812
Port.

477
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:39,781
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

478
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:44,285
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

479
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,593
What makes the grass grow?

480
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:48,734
Blood, blood, blood.

481
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:51,634
What do we do for a living, ladies?

482
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:53,502
Kill, kill, kill.

483
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,267
I can't hear you.

484
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:57,139
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:57,312 --> 00:31:00,372
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

486
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:02,176
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:06,884
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

488
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,881
None of you dumb-asses knows?

489
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,221
Private Cowboy.

490
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:17,752
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

491
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,766
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 1 2 people...

492
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:25,134
... from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

493
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:28,196
From distances of up to 400 yards.

494
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:32,209
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

495
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,439
Private Snowball.

496
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:35,945
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

497
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,951
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

498
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:43,444
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

499
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,581
All right, knock it off.

500
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:47,649
Two hundred and fifty feet.

501
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,028
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

502
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:57,798
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
ltalian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

503
00:31:57,973 --> 00:32:01,431
... and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

504
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,774
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

505
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:08,309
Private Joker.

506
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:10,406
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

507
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,111
In the Marines. Outstanding.

508
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:18,248
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

509
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:20,987
And before you ladies leave my island...

510
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:24,496
... you will all be able
to do the same thing.

511
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:46,248
Today...

512
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:48,582
... is Christmas.

513
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:53,956
There will be a magic show at 0930.

514
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:57,890
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

515
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:02,628
... about how the free world
will conquer communism...

516
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:07,434
... with the aid of God and a few Marines.

517
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:11,901
God has a hard-on for Marines...

518
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,744
... because we kill everything we see.

519
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,308
He plays his games...

520
00:33:19,488 --> 00:33:22,184
... we play ours.

521
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:27,215
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

522
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:32,754
... we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

523
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:37,494
God was here before the Marine Corps.

524
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:40,665
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

525
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:44,539
... but your ass belongs to the Corps.

526
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,669
Do you ladies understand?

527
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:49,840
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I can't hear you.

528
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:51,849
Sir, yes, sir.

529
00:33:57,626 --> 00:34:00,925
It's been swabbed and brushed.

530
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,094
Everything...

531
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,831
... is clean.

532
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,502
Beautiful.

533
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:16,737
So that it slides perfect.

534
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:20,342
Nice.

535
00:34:22,651 --> 00:34:24,812
Everything clean.

536
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:27,246
Oiled.

537
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,480
So that your action is beautiful.

538
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,695
Smooth Charlene.

539
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:03,447
Leonard talks to his rifle.

540
00:35:05,694 --> 00:35:07,321
Yeah.

541
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:17,763
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

542
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,703
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

543
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:27,235
It don't surprise me.

544
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:41,125
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

545
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,394
What will you take in trade?

546
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,525
What do you got?

547
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:06,780
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

548
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:09,651
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

549
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,690
Sir, yes, sir.

550
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:16,860
What's your sixth general order?

551
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:19,523
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

552
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:22,091
... and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

553
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,033
... all orders....

554
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:25,969
Sir, the private's sixth general....

555
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:28,563
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

556
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:32,009
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

557
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,273
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

558
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,852
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

559
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:44,185
-Sir, four counts, sir.
-What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

560
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,625
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

561
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:50,287
What's your fifth general order?

562
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:54,492
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

563
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:56,466
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

564
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:59,471
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

565
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:02,405
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

566
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:06,172
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

567
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,441
Sir, yes, sir.

568
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:13,548
I don 't want no teenage queen

569
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:16,316
I don 't want no teenage queen

570
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:19,153
I just want my M14

571
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,921
I just want my M14

572
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:24,793
If I die in a combat zone

573
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:27,526
If I die in a combat zone

574
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,262
Box me up and ship me home

575
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:33,066
Box me up and ship me home

576
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,869
Pin my medals upon my chest

577
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:38,638
Pin my medals upon my chest

578
00:37:38,814 --> 00:37:41,408
Tell my mom I done my best

579
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,482
Tell my mom I done my best

580
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:49,590
Graduation is only a few days away...

581
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:54,327
... and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

582
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:58,462
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

583
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:04,468
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

584
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:08,237
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

585
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:11,375
The Marine Corps wants killers.

586
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:15,320
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

587
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:18,289
Men without fear.

588
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:24,823
Today, you people are
no longer maggots.

589
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:29,964
Today, you are Marines.

590
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:33,372
You 're part of a brotherhood.

591
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:37,638
From now on, until the day you die...

592
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:40,111
... wherever you are...

593
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:43,775
... every Marine is your brother.

594
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:47,981
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

595
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:51,388
Some of you will not come back.

596
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,755
But always remember this:

597
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:55,794
Marines die.

598
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,490
That's what we're here for.

599
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:01,762
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

600
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:06,670
... and that means you live forever.

601
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:12,207
-Peckett.
-Sir, yes, sir.

602
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:14,042
0300, lnfantry.

603

-Adams.
-Sir, yes, sir.

606
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,584
1 800, Engineers.

607
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:23,281
You go out and find mines.

608
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:25,256
-Cowboy.
-Sir, yes, sir.

609
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:27,293
0300, lnfantry.

-Taylor.
-Sir, yes, sir.

611

0300, lnfantry.

612
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,592
-Joker.
-Sir, yes, sir.

613
00:39:32,768 --> 00:39:35,896
421 2, Basic Military Journalism.

614
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,131
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

615
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:39,831
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

616
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:42,034
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

617
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:44,634
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

618
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:48,477
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

619
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:49,879
A killer, yes, sir.

620
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,610
Gomer Pyle.

621
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,381
-Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

622
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:58,482
You forget your fucking name?
0300, lnfantry. You made it.

623
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:00,788
-Perkins.
-Sir, yes, sir.

624
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,800
Our last night on the island.

625
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,495
I draw fire watch.

626
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:16,430
Hi, Joker.

627
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:41,954
Are those live rounds?

628
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,792
Seven-six-two millimeter.

629
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:56,832
Full metal jacket.

630
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:07,343
Leonard...

631
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:11,380
... if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

632
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:15,621
... we'll both be in a world of shit.

633
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:21,199
I am...

634
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:24,927
... in a world...

635
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:29,000
... of shit.

636
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:33,476
Left shoulder.

637
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:37,450
Right shoulder.

638
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:41,818
Lock and load.

639
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:47,994
Order.

640
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,630
This is my rifle.

641
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,565
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

642
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,138
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

643
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:02,800
Get back in your bunks.

644
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:05,139
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

645
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:10,172
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

646
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:13,685
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

647
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:16,689
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

648
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,215
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

649
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:23,593
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

650
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:28,499
... that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

651
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:39,809
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

652
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:42,746
... and you listen good.

653
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:45,449
I want that weapon...

654
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,249
... and I want it now.

655
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:53,023
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

656
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:56,028
... and step back away from it.

657
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:06,964
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

658
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:11,408
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

659
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:39,031
Easy, Leonard.

660
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:44,570
Go easy, man.

661
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:11,500
No!

662
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,661
Hey, baby.

663
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,862
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

664
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,667
Not just this minute.

665
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:23,141
Well, baby, me so horny.

666
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:25,473
Me so horny.

667
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:28,207
Me love you long time.

668
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:29,979
You party?

669
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:32,279
Yeah, we might party.

670
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:35,252
-How much?
-Fifteen dollar.

671
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:39,451
-Fifteen dollars for both of us.
-No. Each you $1 5.

672
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:41,550
Me love you long time.

673
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,358
Me so horny.

674
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:46,831
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

675
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:50,267
-Five dollars each.
-Me sucky-sucky.

676
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:53,033
Me love you too much.

677
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:57,742
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

678
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:00,837
Okay. Ten dollar each.

679
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:03,507
What do we get for $1 0?

680
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:06,483
Everything you want.

681
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:09,818
-Everything?
-Everything.

682
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:14,955
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

683
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,018
Just a minute.

684
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:21,496
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

685
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,433
The other half have got TB.

686
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:27,128
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

687
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:18,789
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

688
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:20,622
Yeah.

689
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:25,025
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

690
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,531
What?

691
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:30,557
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

692
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:32,695
I just can't feature that.

693
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:36,333
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

694
00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:41,502
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

695
00:48:41,683 --> 00:48:43,639
I've been in country
almost three months...

696
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:46,583
... and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

697
00:48:46,755 --> 00:48:49,781
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

698
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:52,256
A high school girl could do my job.

699
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:54,224
I wanna get out into the shit.

700
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:56,990
I wanna get some trigger time.

701
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,392
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

702
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,333
... and she'll beat the shit out of me.

703
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:05,996
That's a negative, Rafterman.

704
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:12,703
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

705
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,713
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

706
00:49:19,154 --> 00:49:20,644
Rear-echelon paranoia.

707
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:25,119
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

708
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:27,785
They say the same thing every year.

709
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,727
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

710
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:31,695
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

711
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:36,031
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

712
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:39,560
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

713
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:42,596
... barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

714
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:46,367
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

715
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:49,813
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

716
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:52,476
-Rafterman, you take it.
-Aye, aye, sir.

717
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,316
And get some good low-angle stuff.

718
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:58,550
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

719
00:49:58,727 --> 00:50:00,991
-Yes, sir.
-""Diplomats in dungarees.

720
00:50:01,163 --> 00:50:04,860
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently....""

721
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:08,332
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

722
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:11,597
... if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

723
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:13,536
I'll make a note of it, sir.

724
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:16,734
""NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

725
00:50:16,912 --> 00:50:20,939
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

726
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,914
... deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets.""

727
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:27,180
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

728
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:31,087
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

729
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:32,317
I'll fix it up, sir.

730
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:34,786
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

731
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:36,123
Dave, do 1 00 words on it.

732
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:38,823
-AFTV will give you some background stuff.
-Sir.

733
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:40,764
"" Not while we're eating.

734
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:43,461
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

735
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:45,970
... don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow.""

736
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:50,032
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

737
00:50:50,312 --> 00:50:54,806
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

738
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:58,282
-Sweep-and-clear, got it?
-Got it. Very catchy.

739
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:01,385
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

740
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:03,515
Sir?

741
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:07,617
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

742
00:51:07,796 --> 00:51:09,058
Didn't see them.

743
00:51:10,098 --> 00:51:13,488
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

744
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:17,126
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

745
00:51:17,305 --> 00:51:19,569
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

746
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:23,336
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

747
00:51:23,512 --> 00:51:27,209
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

748
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:29,043
It was raining, sir.

749
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,384
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

750
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:35,648
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

751
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:38,190
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

752
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:40,024
Whichever you say.

753
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:42,686
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

754
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:46,062
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

755
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:47,832
Joker...

756
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:51,393
... maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

757
00:51:51,573 --> 00:51:54,701
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

758
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:57,003
Now, it is our job to report the news...

759
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:00,239
... that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

760
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:04,611
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

761
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:08,517
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

762
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:11,115
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

763
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,249
Can't say I liked it much.

764
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:16,420
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

765
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:19,624
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

766
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:21,996
... in the rear with the gear.

767
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:32,509
Tet. The year of the monkey.

768
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:35,809
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

769
00:52:35,984 --> 00:52:41,081
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

770
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:53,461
I am fucking bored to death, man.

771
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,560
I gotta get back in the shit.

772
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:59,799
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

773
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:01,974
Joker's so tough...

774
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,600
... he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

775
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,668
... then ask for seconds.

776
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:10,242
Listen up, pilgrim.

777
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:14,912
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

778
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,687
Shit.

779
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:20,749
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

780
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,851
He's never been in the shit.

781
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:25,761
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

782
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:28,459
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

783
00:53:28,637 --> 00:53:31,299
-You weren't even in country.
-Eat shit and die...

784
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:34,328
... you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

785
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:35,908
I was there, man.

786
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:37,806
I was in the shit with the grunts.

787
00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:41,767
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

788
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:45,340
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

789
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:47,544
You listen to Joker, new guy.

790
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:49,316
He knows ti ti.

791
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:51,015
Very little.

792
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:53,991
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

793
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:57,689
-The stare?
-The thousand-yard stare.

794
00:53:57,866 --> 00:54:00,858
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

795
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:02,560
It's like--

796
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:04,859
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

797
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:06,835
I got it.

798
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:08,839
All field Marines got it.

799
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,500
And you'll have it too.

800
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:11,976
I will?

801
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:13,705
Hey, Payback...

802
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:16,976
... how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

803
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:20,475
-Fuck you, Stork.
-Throw them a basketball.

804
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:27,586
-lncoming.
-Oh, shit.

805
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,152
Them are outgoing.

806
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:35,331
-That ain't outgoing.
-That ain't outgoing.

807
00:54:35,503 --> 00:54:37,130
Now, what did I just say?

808
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:18,474
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

809
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:21,912
-I ain't ready for this shit.
-Amen.

810
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:16,724
Cease fire.

811
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:22,936
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

812
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:28,572
Cease fire.

813
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:41,552
The enemy...

814
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,221
... has very deceitfully...

815
00:56:44,399 --> 00:56:47,254
... taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

816
00:56:47,435 --> 00:56:50,768
... to launch an offensive
all over the country.

817
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:54,769
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.

818
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:57,138
But we seem to be the exception.

819
00:56:57,879 --> 00:57:02,634
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

820
00:57:02,817 --> 00:57:08,676
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

821
00:57:08,857 --> 00:57:10,779
-Shit.
-Jesus Christ, man.

822
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:14,486
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

823
00:57:15,764 --> 00:57:18,324
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

824
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,426
... has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

825
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:26,665
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

826
00:57:26,841 --> 00:57:29,605
... the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

827
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:34,704
... and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

828
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:37,045
In other words...

829
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:42,042
... it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

830
00:57:44,926 --> 00:57:46,689
Sir.

831
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:49,850
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

832
00:57:54,669 --> 00:57:59,026
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phu Bai.

833
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:02,704
Captain January will need all his people.

834
00:58:02,877 --> 00:58:05,141
-Yes, sir.
-And, Joker...

835
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:08,305
... you will take off that damn button.

836
00:58:08,483 --> 00:58:11,907
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

837
00:58:12,086 --> 00:58:13,576
Sir.

838
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:15,916
Permission to go with Joker?

839
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:18,580
-Permission granted.
-Thank you, sir.

840
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,684
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

841
00:58:21,863 --> 00:58:23,956
You still here?

842
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:27,761
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

843
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:30,268
You're responsible for him.

844
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:07,734
Get some.

845
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:10,305
Get some.

846
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:15,803
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:20,549
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

848
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:26,184
Get some.

849
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:35,862
Get some, baby.

850
00:59:36,204 --> 00:59:38,593
Get some. Get some. Get some.

851
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:42,235
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

852
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,901
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

853
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,274
I've got you, mother.

854
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,248
Anyone who runs is a VC.

855
00:59:55,823 --> 00:59:58,348
Anyone who stands still...

856
00:59:58,526 --> 01:00:01,450
... is a well-disciplined VC.

857
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:07,027
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

858
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:11,262
Why should we do a story about you?

859
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,732
Because I'm so fucking good.

860
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:16,035
That ain't no shit neither.

861
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:20,670
I've done got me 1 57 dead gooks killed.

862
01:00:20,848 --> 01:00:23,612
And 50 water buffaloes too.

863
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:26,583
Them are all certified.

864
01:00:26,754 --> 01:00:29,609
Any women or children?

865
01:00:30,124 --> 01:00:31,751
Sometimes.

866
01:00:32,894 --> 01:00:36,591
How can you shoot women and children?

867
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,495
Easy.

868
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:41,055
You just don't lead them so much.

869
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:44,560
Ain't war hell?

870
01:01:21,142 --> 01:01:23,269
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

871
01:01:23,444 --> 01:01:24,934
Down the road. Two-Five.

872
01:01:25,113 --> 01:01:27,877
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

873
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,267
Excuse me.

874
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:55,807
Sir.

875
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:59,071
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

876
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:00,680
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

877
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:02,247
You people one-one?

878
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:04,715
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

879
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:06,717
-Stars and Stripes?
-Yes, sir.

880
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:08,913
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

881
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:11,888
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

882
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,723
-You mind if we tag along, sir?
-No problem. Welcome aboard.

883
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:19,128
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

884
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,530
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

885
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:23,193
I played ball for Notre Dame.

886
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:24,668
-Notre Dame?
-Yeah.

887
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:27,535
-All right.
-You here to make Cowboy famous?

888
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:29,301
Never happen, sir.

889
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:33,743
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

890
01:02:33,915 --> 01:02:37,078
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

891
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:40,015
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

892
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:41,678
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

893
01:02:41,856 --> 01:02:44,381
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

894
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,754
... street by street and house by house.

895
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:48,919
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

896
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:51,361
... but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

897
01:02:51,532 --> 01:02:55,730
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

898
01:02:55,903 --> 01:02:57,336
That's affirmative.

899
01:02:57,505 --> 01:03:01,134
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

900
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:03,470
Will you show me where, sir?

901
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:07,405
Here's the canal.

902
01:03:30,404 --> 01:03:33,567
The dead have been covered with lime.

903
01:03:34,776 --> 01:03:37,631
The dead know only one thing:

904
01:03:38,312 --> 01:03:40,837
It is better to be alive.

905
01:03:47,155 --> 01:03:48,747
Excuse me?

906
01:03:48,923 --> 01:03:51,187
-Good morning, lieutenant.
-Morning.

907
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,920
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

908
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:56,529
What outfit are you men with?

909
01:03:56,697 --> 01:03:58,824
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

910
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,624
-Oh, I see.
-I'm Sergeant Joker...

911
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:03,100
... and this photographer is Rafterman.

912
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,865
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

913
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,964
-Have you got a body count, sir?
-We think it's 20.

914
01:04:09,143 --> 01:04:11,236
Do you know how it happened, sir?

915
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:15,378
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

916
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:20,112
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.

917
01:04:20,288 --> 01:04:22,279
They went around
to their houses real polite...

918
01:04:22,456 --> 01:04:25,789
... and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

919
01:04:26,294 --> 01:04:28,558
Everybody who turned up got shot.

920
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:30,356
Some they buried alive.

921
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:31,895
Ready.

922
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:34,934
Colonel.

923
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:39,166
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

924
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,602
A peace symbol, sir.

925
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,369
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

926
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:45,676
What is that written on your helmet?

927
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:47,337
Born to kill, sir.

928
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:50,506
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

929
01:04:50,685 --> 01:04:53,017
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

930
01:04:53,187 --> 01:04:55,747
-No, sir.
-What is it supposed to mean?

931
01:04:55,923 --> 01:04:57,288
I don't know, sir.

932
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:58,948
-You don't know much.
-No, sir.

933
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:02,358
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

934
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,259
-Yes, sir.
-Now answer my question...

935
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:06,798
... or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

936
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:09,926
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

937
01:05:10,104 --> 01:05:13,699
-The what?
-The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

938
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:17,139
-Whose side are you on, son?
-Our side, sir.

939
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,938
-You love your country?
-Yes, sir.

940
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:20,705
How about getting with the program.

941
01:05:20,882 --> 01:05:23,305
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

942
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:24,508
Yes, sir.

943
01:05:24,685 --> 01:05:29,145
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

944
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:31,052
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

945
01:05:31,225 --> 01:05:35,150
... because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

946
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:36,990
It's a hardball world, son.

947
01:05:37,164 --> 01:05:40,793
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

948
01:05:40,968 --> 01:05:41,992
Aye, aye, sir.

949
01:05:52,446 --> 01:05:56,177
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

950
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,147
Around the back.

951
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:09,855
-First Platoon?
-Yeah, through there.

952
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:35,613
Hey, Lone Ranger.

953
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,323
-Holy shit. It's the Joker.
-You old motherfucker.

954
01:06:48,402 --> 01:06:49,391
What's happening?

955
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:53,392
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

956
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:55,432
What's happening, man?

957
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:58,999
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

958
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,136
Yeah? Well, why go back?

959
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:02,839
Here or there, samey-same.

960
01:07:03,017 --> 01:07:04,712
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

961
01:07:04,885 --> 01:07:08,981
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

962
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:12,184
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

963
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,523
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland,
and this is...?

964
01:07:15,696 --> 01:07:17,652
-Rafterman.
-Rafterman.

965
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:20,665
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

966
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:22,132
-Fucking A.
-Yeah.

967
01:07:22,303 --> 01:07:24,225
We're the Lusthog Squad.

968
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:26,965
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

969
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:30,633
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

970
01:07:35,082 --> 01:07:37,778
You a photographer?

971
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,780
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

972
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,281
Oh, you seen much combat?

973
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:50,395
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

974
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:57,499
You're a real comedian.

975
01:07:58,773 --> 01:08:01,503
Well, they call me the Joker.

976
01:08:02,777 --> 01:08:05,268
Well, I got a joke for you.

977
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:08,678
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

978
01:08:11,886 --> 01:08:13,751
Well, pilgrim...

979
01:08:13,921 --> 01:08:19,052
... only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

980
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:26,558
You talk the talk.

981
01:08:27,768 --> 01:08:30,601
Do you walk the walk?

982
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:36,499
Now, you might not believe it...

983
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:41,939
... but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

984
01:08:42,116 --> 01:08:46,246
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

985
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,584
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

986
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,591
Hey, jungle-bunny.

987
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:58,561
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

988
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:00,563
Yeah, Mother.

989
01:09:01,836 --> 01:09:03,633
Hey, photographer.

990
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,064
You wanna take a good picture?

991
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:09,775
Here, man.

992
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:11,601
Take this.

993
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:23,309
This is my bro.

994
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,993
This is his party.

995
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:37,330
He's the guest of honor.

996
01:09:38,272 --> 01:09:40,934
Today is his birthday.

997
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:44,340
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

998
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:47,735
I will never forget this day.

999
01:09:47,915 --> 01:09:53,205
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

1000
01:09:53,687 --> 01:09:56,986
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1001
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:00,689
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1002
01:10:02,663 --> 01:10:05,621
These are great days we're living, bros.

1003
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:10,794
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1004
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:13,928
These people we wasted here today...

1005
01:10:14,108 --> 01:10:17,339
... are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1006
01:10:19,146 --> 01:10:20,807
After we rotate back to the world...

1007
01:10:20,981 --> 01:10:24,280
... we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1008
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:33,413
-Stay put, keep your heads down.
-Stay put.

1009
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:35,214
Stay put.

1010
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:52,430
Shit.

1011
01:12:00,314 --> 01:12:03,806
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1012
01:12:05,519 --> 01:12:09,182
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1013
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:11,689
Delta Six.

1014
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:14,987
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1015
01:12:15,462 --> 01:12:17,054
The lieutenant is down.

1016
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:20,189
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1017
01:12:25,839 --> 01:12:28,330
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1018
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:31,102
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1019
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:33,644
I want the third team up this road here.

1020
01:12:33,814 --> 01:12:37,705
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

1021
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:41,040
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1022
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:10,362
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1023
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:13,698
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1024
01:17:13,872 --> 01:17:16,238
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1025
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:19,070
-T. H. E. Rock can be a rock.
-I'll be Ann-Margret.

1026
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:21,166
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1027
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,837
-I'll be General Custer.
-Who'll be the lndian?

1028
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:27,042
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.

1029
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,214
You're going home now.

1030
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,060
Semper fi.

1031
01:18:16,034 --> 01:18:18,628
We're mean Marines, sir.

1032
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:24,134
Go easy, bros.

1033
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,339
Better you than me.

1034
01:18:34,052 --> 01:18:36,714
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1035
01:18:37,522 --> 01:18:39,752
What cause was that?

1036
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:42,817
Freedom.

1037
01:18:43,628 --> 01:18:46,552
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1038
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:51,121
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1039
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,465
This is a slaughter.

1040
01:18:55,707 --> 01:18:59,234
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1041
01:19:00,312 --> 01:19:03,201
... my word is poon tang.

1042
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:08,681
Tough break for Hand Job.

1043
01:19:09,588 --> 01:19:13,046
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1044
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:16,549
What was the matter with him?

1045
01:19:18,897 --> 01:19:22,094
He was jerking off 1 0 times a day.

1046
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:26,796
It's no shit. At least 1 0 times a day.

1047
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:34,064
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1048
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,540
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1049
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:41,644
Instant Section Eight.

1050
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,744
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1051
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:51,115
You ready? Turn over.

1052
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,962
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1053
01:19:57,068 --> 01:20:01,061
Well, like-- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1054
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:04,766
... so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1055
01:20:04,943 --> 01:20:07,332
So they send us in first to squat...

1056
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:11,243
... make sure that there are no little....

1057
01:20:12,384 --> 01:20:15,615
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1058
01:20:15,787 --> 01:20:18,278
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1059
01:20:18,456 --> 01:20:20,788
... and basically blow the place to hell.

1060
01:20:21,393 --> 01:20:24,988
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1061
01:20:25,163 --> 01:20:27,119
... it's like a war, you know...

1062
01:20:27,299 --> 01:20:29,187
... Iike what-- What--

1063
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:32,359
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was--

1064
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:35,028
You know, was supposed to be.

1065
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,403
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1066
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:42,138
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1067
01:20:42,314 --> 01:20:44,441
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav....

1068
01:20:44,616 --> 01:20:46,743
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

1069
01:20:46,918 --> 01:20:50,251
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1070
01:20:50,422 --> 01:20:53,414
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1071
01:20:54,092 --> 01:20:58,017
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1072
01:20:58,196 --> 01:21:00,426
Can I quote LBJ?

1073
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:05,459
""l will not send American boys...

1074
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:07,901
...8 or 1 0,000 miles
around the world...

1075
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:12,271
... to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves.""

1076
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:18,502
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1077
01:21:18,683 --> 01:21:22,449
... you know, I mean, like they--
It's sort of like...

1078
01:21:22,988 --> 01:21:26,378
... they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1079
01:21:26,558 --> 01:21:28,116
But they don't want it.

1080
01:21:28,293 --> 01:21:30,716
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1081
01:21:30,895 --> 01:21:32,886
Poor, dumb bastards.

1082
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:38,498
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty-- Pretty bad boys.

1083
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,433
I'm not real....

1084
01:21:41,606 --> 01:21:44,439
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1085
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:48,033
... that are supposedly on our side.

1086
01:21:48,213 --> 01:21:51,046
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1087
01:21:53,118 --> 01:21:54,142
Yeah.

1088
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,914
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1089
01:21:57,088 --> 01:21:59,249
... and they don't even appreciate it.

1090
01:21:59,924 --> 01:22:01,846
They think it's a big joke.

1091
01:22:02,494 --> 01:22:04,485
Well, if you ask me...

1092
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,988
... we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1093
01:22:07,465 --> 01:22:10,992
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1094
01:22:11,169 --> 01:22:14,730
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1095
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,504
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1096
01:22:18,677 --> 01:22:20,440
Well, I think we should win.

1097
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:23,070
I hate Vietnam.

1098
01:22:23,248 --> 01:22:25,273
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1099
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,577
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1100
01:22:27,752 --> 01:22:30,346
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1101
01:22:31,756 --> 01:22:33,712
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1102
01:22:33,892 --> 01:22:37,919
... and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1103
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:44,226
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1104
01:22:44,836 --> 01:22:49,193
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1105
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:50,671
... and kill them.

1106
01:22:51,109 --> 01:22:55,933
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1107
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:16,793
Ten-hut.

1108
01:23:18,603 --> 01:23:20,127
-All right.
-My, oh, my.

1109
01:23:20,305 --> 01:23:23,194
-Good morning, little schoolgirl.
-Look at this lady.

1110
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,468
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1111
01:23:25,844 --> 01:23:27,141
My, my, my.

1112
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:31,011
-What you got there, chief?
-Do you want number one fucky?

1113
01:23:32,183 --> 01:23:35,016
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1114
01:23:35,186 --> 01:23:37,575
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1115
01:23:37,756 --> 01:23:40,953
-Me want sucky.
-Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1116
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:43,686
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1117
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:47,820
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1118
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:50,263
-Fifteen dollars each.
-No.

1119
01:23:52,604 --> 01:23:55,266
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1120
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,702
Five dollar each.

1121
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:58,672
Come on, she love you good.

1122
01:23:58,843 --> 01:24:00,367
Boom-boom long time.

1123
01:24:00,545 --> 01:24:02,240
-Ten dollars.
-Five dollars.

1124
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:03,904
No. Ten dollars.

1125
01:24:04,048 --> 01:24:06,243
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.

1126
01:24:06,418 --> 01:24:09,251
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1127
01:24:10,155 --> 01:24:11,918
Okay, $5. You give me.

1128
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,422
-Okay, okay.
-All right.

1129
01:24:15,693 --> 01:24:17,058
Let's get mounted.

1130
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,025
Something wrong there, chief?

1131
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:26,158
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1132
01:24:26,337 --> 01:24:27,895
What the motherfuck?

1133
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:30,597
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1134
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,106
What is this, man?

1135
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:37,340
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1136
01:24:38,349 --> 01:24:41,045
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1137
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:42,880
Oh, shit.

1138
01:24:43,054 --> 01:24:46,751
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1139
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:49,985
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1140
01:24:50,161 --> 01:24:52,083
Excuse me, ma'am.

1141
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:54,788
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1142
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:59,391
... is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1143
01:24:59,604 --> 01:25:02,164
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1144
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:05,130
Okay, okay.

1145
01:25:05,844 --> 01:25:07,800
Okay, okay.

1146
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:11,411
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1147
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:13,778
-Hey, we need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

1148
01:25:13,952 --> 01:25:17,342
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1149
01:25:17,522 --> 01:25:20,821
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1150
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:24,120
-Hey, Animal, man.
-You son of a--

1151
01:25:24,295 --> 01:25:28,425
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1152
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,898
-I don't want it after you, man.
-Fuck you.

1153
01:26:04,102 --> 01:26:06,400
Intelligence passed the word down...

1154
01:26:06,571 --> 01:26:10,132
... that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1155
01:26:10,308 --> 01:26:13,266
... to positions across the Perfume River.

1156
01:26:13,444 --> 01:26:17,835
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1157
01:26:49,314 --> 01:26:52,078
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1158
01:27:05,563 --> 01:27:07,087
Shit.

1159
01:27:15,673 --> 01:27:17,561
He ain't gonna make it.

1160
01:27:20,478 --> 01:27:22,105
Shit.

1161
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,885
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1162
01:27:33,324 --> 01:27:36,816
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1163
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:39,185
Hotel One. Over.

1164
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:41,389
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1165
01:27:41,566 --> 01:27:44,899
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1166
01:27:46,104 --> 01:27:47,799
Wait, One.

1167
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:53,433
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1168
01:27:53,745 --> 01:27:55,337
-Continue with the patrol...
-Shit.

1169
01:27:55,513 --> 01:27:57,811
-... and call in at the next checkpoint.
-Shit.

1170
01:27:57,982 --> 01:28:00,712
Roger. Out.

1171
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:08,990
I ' m squad leader.

1172
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:14,385
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1173
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,058
All right.

1174
01:28:17,869 --> 01:28:19,427
He's dead.

1175
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:02,069
Cowboy.

1176
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:10,148
What's up?

1177
01:29:10,421 --> 01:29:13,652
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1178
01:29:13,825 --> 01:29:16,214
Here, see what you think.

1179
01:29:18,329 --> 01:29:21,355
I think we're here...

1180
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:24,823
... and we should be here.

1181
01:29:26,437 --> 01:29:28,564
-We're here?
-Yeah.

1182
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,005
-We should be here?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1183
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:39,878
Fuck.

1184
01:29:45,223 --> 01:29:46,850
What do you think?

1185
01:29:48,493 --> 01:29:51,257
Well, I think we should change direction.

1186
01:30:05,209 --> 01:30:06,767
Okay.

1187
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:09,436
We'll change direction.

1188
01:30:20,091 --> 01:30:21,649
What's up?

1189
01:30:21,826 --> 01:30:23,748
Changing direction.

1190
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:25,690
What are we, lost?

1191
01:30:25,863 --> 01:30:28,957
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1192
01:30:29,267 --> 01:30:31,394
Okay, listen up.

1193
01:30:31,569 --> 01:30:33,662
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1194
01:30:33,838 --> 01:30:35,669
Okay, we're changing direction.

1195
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,569
We're heading over that way.

1196
01:30:37,742 --> 01:30:40,939
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1197
01:30:41,445 --> 01:30:43,834
-Got it?
-Got it.

1198
01:30:44,549 --> 01:30:47,541
Eightball, let's dance.

1199
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:50,417
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1200
01:31:51,515 --> 01:31:53,039
Fuck.

1201
01:32:08,766 --> 01:32:10,165
Cease fire.

1202
01:32:10,334 --> 01:32:12,222
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1203
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:14,928
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1204
01:32:15,106 --> 01:32:16,630
-Hold it.
-Cease fire.

1205
01:32:16,807 --> 01:32:18,035
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

1206
01:32:18,209 --> 01:32:21,736
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1207
01:32:21,913 --> 01:32:23,574
Anybody see a sniper?

1208
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:25,238
-Nothing.
-Negative.

1209
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:29,307
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1210
01:32:30,254 --> 01:32:31,414
Eightball.

1211
01:32:31,589 --> 01:32:34,183
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1212
01:32:34,358 --> 01:32:36,053
Animal, cease fire.

1213
01:32:36,227 --> 01:32:38,354
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1214
01:32:38,529 --> 01:32:40,019
This is Cowboy. Over.

1215
01:32:40,164 --> 01:32:43,622
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1216
01:32:43,801 --> 01:32:46,099
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1217
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,532
Eightball is down.

1218
01:32:47,705 --> 01:32:50,594
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1219
01:32:50,775 --> 01:32:54,472
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1220
01:32:54,645 --> 01:32:58,137
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1221
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:00,048
Roger. Understand.

1222
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:02,708
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1223
01:33:02,887 --> 01:33:05,253
Roger. Over and out.

1224
01:33:05,423 --> 01:33:07,721
-Stay close.
-Got it.

1225
01:33:08,359 --> 01:33:12,386
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1226
01:33:12,563 --> 01:33:16,124
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1227
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,165
I've requested tank support.

1228
01:33:18,336 --> 01:33:21,601
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1229
01:33:21,772 --> 01:33:25,799
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1230
01:33:26,844 --> 01:33:29,574
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1231
01:33:29,747 --> 01:33:31,635
-Cease your fucking fire.
-Cowboy.

1232
01:33:31,816 --> 01:33:33,579
-What?
-We can't leave him out there.

1233
01:33:33,751 --> 01:33:36,515
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1234
01:33:36,687 --> 01:33:39,349
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1235
01:33:39,523 --> 01:33:41,548
I seen this before.

1236
01:33:41,726 --> 01:33:44,957
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1237
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:49,994
Goddamn it. No.

1238
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:53,091
-Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
-Man, fuck this--

1239
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:55,363
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1240
01:33:55,539 --> 01:33:59,100
-No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
-Cover me.

1241
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:19,520
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1242
01:34:19,697 --> 01:34:21,961
Cease fire.

1243
01:34:33,344 --> 01:34:34,641
Hold your fire.

1244
01:34:34,812 --> 01:34:36,837
Hold your fire.

1245
01:34:37,014 --> 01:34:39,505
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1246
01:34:39,683 --> 01:34:44,040
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1247
01:34:49,493 --> 01:34:51,290
Hold your fire.

1248
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:54,487
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1249
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,724
Give me that fucking radio.

1250
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:04,533
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1251
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,198
This is Murphy. Over.

1252
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:08,709
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1253
01:35:08,913 --> 01:35:11,802
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

1254
01:35:12,883 --> 01:35:16,341
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1255
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,784
Will advise. Over.

1256
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:21,746
Roger. Out.

1257
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,457
Numb-nut bastards.

1258
01:35:24,628 --> 01:35:27,722
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1259
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:30,658
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1260
01:35:30,835 --> 01:35:32,757
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1261
01:35:32,937 --> 01:35:35,132
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1262
01:35:35,306 --> 01:35:38,264
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1263
01:35:38,442 --> 01:35:40,706
-Ready to pull out.
-Wait a minute. Hold it.

1264
01:35:41,112 --> 01:35:44,900
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1265
01:35:45,082 --> 01:35:46,344
Back off, Mother.

1266
01:35:46,517 --> 01:35:49,475
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1267
01:35:49,653 --> 01:35:51,450
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1268
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:55,410
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1269
01:35:55,593 --> 01:35:57,857
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1270
01:35:58,028 --> 01:35:59,859
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1271
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,760
-You know that.
-Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1272
01:36:02,933 --> 01:36:05,424
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1273
01:36:05,569 --> 01:36:07,935
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1274
01:36:12,143 --> 01:36:16,273
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1275
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:21,408
-Goddamn it.
-Fucking son of a bitch.

1276
01:36:21,585 --> 01:36:24,281
You motherfucker.

1277
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:42,667
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1278
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:46,430
Where's the sniper?

1279
01:36:49,413 --> 01:36:52,576
Doc, where's the sniper?

1280
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:03,021
Shit.

1281
01:37:04,628 --> 01:37:07,153
Shit. Fuck.

1282
01:37:21,478 --> 01:37:23,070
Fuck.

1283
01:37:54,745 --> 01:37:56,872
Hey, Cowboy.

1284
01:37:57,214 --> 01:37:58,977
Yeah?

1285
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:03,342
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1286
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:07,446
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1287
01:38:07,825 --> 01:38:11,682
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1288
01:38:12,529 --> 01:38:14,019
Come on.

1289
01:38:16,634 --> 01:38:18,829
Son of a bitch.

1290
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:25,166
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1291
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:30,442
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1292
01:38:30,881 --> 01:38:33,270
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1293
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,248
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1294
01:38:37,121 --> 01:38:39,453
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming too.

1295
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:41,454
Okay.

1296
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:43,286
-You all set?
-Yeah.

1297
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,484
Let's move out.

1298
01:38:44,862 --> 01:38:45,920
Let's do it.

1299
01:39:24,134 --> 01:39:25,465
Hey, Cowboy.

1300
01:39:25,636 --> 01:39:28,127
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1301
01:39:47,891 --> 01:39:50,587
Donlon, give me that radio.

1302
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:54,859
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1303
01:40:05,376 --> 01:40:07,765
-Cowboy.
-Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1304
01:40:07,945 --> 01:40:09,833
Get him the fuck out of here.

1305
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:19,249
-I ain't got a first aid.
-I don't believe this shit.

1306
01:40:19,423 --> 01:40:21,550
-Give me your hand.
-Shut up.

1307
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:23,317
-Take it easy, Cowboy.
-Don't move.

1308
01:40:23,494 --> 01:40:24,791
-Shit.
-That son of a bitch.

1309
01:40:24,962 --> 01:40:26,827
-You'll be all right.
-You're going home.

1310
01:40:26,997 --> 01:40:29,830
-Shut up.
-Don't shit me.

1311
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,629
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1312
01:40:34,271 --> 01:40:35,465
Come on. Easy.

1313
01:40:35,873 --> 01:40:36,999
Here you go.

1314
01:40:38,709 --> 01:40:42,600
-Cowboy.
-Hang on, man. Hang on.

1315
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:49,476
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1316
01:40:55,559 --> 01:40:58,983
-I can hack it.
-You can hack it, man.

1317
01:41:55,052 --> 01:41:57,612
Let's go get some payback.

1318
01:42:03,527 --> 01:42:05,119
Okay.

1319
01:42:11,268 --> 01:42:12,997
Okay.

1320
01:42:20,444 --> 01:42:22,537
Watch that fucking hole.

1321
01:42:23,814 --> 01:42:25,042
Throw some smoke.

1322
01:42:41,565 --> 01:42:43,362
Okay, ready?

1323
01:43:24,374 --> 01:43:28,105
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1324
01:43:33,183 --> 01:43:35,845
Joker, in there. New guy.

1325
01:45:39,843 --> 01:45:42,767
We got the sniper.

1326
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,004
Joker?

1327
01:46:18,548 --> 01:46:20,038
Yo.

1328
01:46:20,383 --> 01:46:21,941
What's up?

1329
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,581
We got the sniper.

1330
01:46:38,135 --> 01:46:40,091
I saved Joker's ass.

1331
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:42,067
I got the sniper.

1332
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,901
I fucking blew her away.

1333
01:46:45,742 --> 01:46:47,698
Am I bad?

1334
01:46:48,311 --> 01:46:52,304
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1335
01:47:09,866 --> 01:47:12,027
What's she saying?

1336
01:47:15,672 --> 01:47:17,503
She's praying.

1337
01:47:21,378 --> 01:47:24,677
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1338
01:47:27,584 --> 01:47:30,007
There's nothing we can do for her.

1339
01:47:31,588 --> 01:47:33,681
She's dead meat.

1340
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:39,594
Okay.

1341
01:47:40,897 --> 01:47:43,058
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1342
01:47:47,571 --> 01:47:49,436
What about her?

1343
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,871
Fuck her.

1344
01:47:56,213 --> 01:47:57,908
Let her rot.

1345
01:48:14,231 --> 01:48:16,563
We can't just leave her here.

1346
01:48:19,769 --> 01:48:21,657
Hey, asshole.

1347
01:48:22,138 --> 01:48:24,368
Cowboy's wasted.

1348
01:48:24,841 --> 01:48:27,401
You're fresh out of friends.

1349
01:48:28,511 --> 01:48:30,342
I'm running this squad now...

1350
01:48:30,513 --> 01:48:34,779
... and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1351
01:48:38,622 --> 01:48:41,682
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1352
01:48:43,526 --> 01:48:47,485
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1353
01:48:57,007 --> 01:48:59,965
Shoot me.

1354
01:49:01,912 --> 01:49:03,937
Shoot...

1355
01:49:04,447 --> 01:49:06,039
... me.

1356
01:49:06,616 --> 01:49:08,709
Shoot...

1357
01:49:09,219 --> 01:49:10,811
... me.

1358
01:49:11,288 --> 01:49:13,279
Shoot.

1359
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:16,653
Shoot.

1360
01:49:17,861 --> 01:49:21,160
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1361
01:49:23,033 --> 01:49:25,126
... waste her.

1362
01:49:25,302 --> 01:49:26,929
Shoot...

1363
01:49:29,105 --> 01:49:30,538
... me.

1364
01:49:34,644 --> 01:49:37,408
Shoot me.

1365
01:49:39,349 --> 01:49:40,577
Shoot...

1366
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:43,580
... me.

1367
01:49:43,954 --> 01:49:46,047
Shoot...

1368
01:49:46,756 --> 01:49:48,189
... me.

1369
01:49:48,792 --> 01:49:50,987
Shoot.

1370
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:54,654
Shoot.

1371
01:49:58,301 --> 01:49:59,825
Shoot.

1372
01:50:00,837 --> 01:50:02,429
Shoot.

1373
01:50:39,743 --> 01:50:41,574
Joker...

1374
01:50:41,745 --> 01:50:46,500
... we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1375
01:50:50,286 --> 01:50:52,413
Hard-core, man.

1376
01:50:54,424 --> 01:50:56,949
Fucking hard-core.

1377
01:51:13,943 --> 01:51:19,006
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1378
01:51:19,616 --> 01:51:24,280
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1379
01:52:02,826 --> 01:52:07,024
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1380
01:52:07,197 --> 01:52:13,329
... about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1381
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:16,666
I am so happy that I am alive...

1382
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,367
... in one piece and short.

1383
01:52:21,044 --> 01:52:24,343
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1384
01:52:24,514 --> 01:52:26,470
... but I am alive.

1385
01:52:26,883 --> 01:52:28,874
And I am not afraid.
