我不认为战争会结束

喂！越南
Hello, Vietnam

我是哈曼士官长 你们的资深训练教官
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your senior drill instructor.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,950
从现在开始 只有叫你们说话才能开口
From now on, you will speak only when spoken to...

16
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,730
从你们那张臭嘴说出来的 第一句与最后一句话都要是“长官”
...and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."

17
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,770
你们这些死老百姓听懂了没？
Do you maggots understand that?

18
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,160
长官，懂了，长官
Sir, yes, sir.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,640
狗屎，我听不到 你们的声音像女人一样
Bullshit. I can't hear you. Sound off like you got a pair.

20
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,170
长官，是，长官
Sir, yes, sir.

21
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,700
如果你们这些娘娘腔想离开我的基地 如果你们想熬过新兵训练
If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training...

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,210
你们就要成为人间武器
...you will be a weapon.

23
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,410
你们要成为死亡大使 祈求战斗
You will be a minister of death praying for war.

24
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,380
直到那天来临之前 你们全是烂货
But until that day, you are pukes.

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,920
你们全是地球上最低等的生物
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

26
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,460
连当人类都没有资格
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,520
你们什么都不是 只是一群没有组织的狗屎蛋
You are nothing but unorganized, grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,560
由于我会很严格 你们都不会喜欢我
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

29
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,430
不过你愈讨厌我 学到的就愈多
But the more you hate me, the more you will learn.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,700
我很凶 不过我很公平
I am hard but I am fair.

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,140
这里没有种族的偏见
There is no racial bigotry here.

32
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,440
我不会歧视黑鬼、犹太佬 意大利佬或小混混
I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers.

在这里 你们全是平等的废物
Here, you are all equally worthless.

34
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,240
我的命令就是铲除
And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers...

35
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,250
那些不该在我深爱的陆战队 服役的笨蛋
...who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps.

36
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,410
你们这些死老百姓听懂了吗？
Do you maggots understand that?

37
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,820
长官，懂了，长官
Sir, yes, sir.

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,720
狗屎，我听不到

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,570
-你喜欢这名字吗？ -长官，是的，长官！
- Do you like that name? - Sir, yes, sir!

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,430
有一件事你不会喜欢，雪球
Well, there's one thing that you won't like, Snowball:

44
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,770
绝对不会有炸鸡和西瓜
They don't serve fried chicken and watermelon...

45
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,040
每天在我的饭厅里出现
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.

46
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,700
长官，是，长官！
Sir, yes, sir!

47

Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

48
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,310
是谁说的？
Who said that?

49
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,440
是谁说的？
Who the fuck said that?

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,080
是哪个滑腔油调的 小共产爱秀杂碎
Who's the slimy little communist-shit, twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,890
在这里自找死路？
...who just signed his own death warrant?

52
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,250
没有人吗？
Nobody, huh?

53

是神仙说的 真他妈的厉害
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it. Out-fucking-standing.

- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck? - Sir, no, sir.

You little scumbag. I've got your name. I've got your ass.

64

你不可以笑也不能哭
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

65
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,330
你会学乖的，我会教到你乖
You will learn by the numbers. I will teach you.

66
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,070
给我站起来 站起来
Now get up. Get on your feet.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,980
最好给我学乖一点 不然我扭下你的头，给你吃屎
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,500
你想堆个几公分到我身上来吗？

89
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,570
全从你老娘的屁股蒸发掉了
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

90
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,070
我看你老是被劈腿
I think you've been cheated.

91
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,340
你哪里人，阿兵哥？

-长官，德州，长官 -靠，德州吗？
- Sir, Texas, sir. - Holy dogshit. Texas?

93
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,240
德州只产没种的阉牛跟死玻璃 牛仔大兵
Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

94
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,910
我看你倒不像阉牛 剩下是什么就很明显了
And you don't much look like a steer to me, so that kind of narrows it down.

95
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,080
-你爱吹喇叭吗？ -长官，不，长官

98
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,960
而且还不肯轮到别人时 也来一下
...and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach around.

99
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,230
我会盯着你
I'll be watching you.

100

107
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,180
-长官，没有，长官 -狗屎，我猜你精于此道
- Sir, no, sir. - Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

-就是会吹 -长官，不是，长官
...through a garden hose. - Sir, no, sir.

我不喜欢劳伦斯这个姓
I don't like the name Lawrence.

110
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,220
只有死玻璃跟水手会叫什么劳伦斯
Only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence.

111

Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle? You think I'm funny?

113
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,130
-长官，不是，长官 -那除去你脸上的笑意

把你脸上愚蠢的笑意去掉
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin off your face...

119

Now choke yourself.

123
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,000
该死的，用我的手，该死的笨蛋
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,200
别拉我的手 我是说，掐住自己
Don't pull my fucking hand over there. I said, choke yourself.

125

Do you mean to tell me that you cannot do one single pull-up?

264
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,410
你这个没用的废物，天兵 快给我滚开

You climb obstacles like old people fuck. Do you know that, Private Pyle?

269
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,670
给我上去，你太慢了 快，动作快
Get up here. You're too slow. Move it. Move it.

270
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,370
天兵，无论如何 不要掉下去
Private Pyle, whatever you do, don't fall down.

Get up and over. Move it, move it, move it.

275
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,680
你要活生生的败在我眼前吗？
Are you quitting on me?

276
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,880
要吗？
Well, are you?

Were you born a fat, slimy, scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

- Sir, aye, aye, sir. - I want that head so sanitary...

311
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,610
连圣母犸丽都引以为荣 而且愿意进去方便一下
...that the Virgin Mary herself would be proud to go in there and take a dump.

312
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,160
-长官，是，长官 -长官，是，长官
- Sir, yes, sir. - Sir, yes, sir.

Private Joker, do you believe in the Virgin Mary?

314

长官，不信，长官
Sir, no, sir.

315
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,400
嗯，小丑大兵 我没听错吧？
Well, Private Joker, I don't believe I heard you correctly.

316
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,760
长官，大兵说“不信”  ，长官
Sir, the private said, "No, sir," sir.

317
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,100

You goddamn communist heathen. Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

319
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,810
不然我会一脚踹死你
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

320
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,310
好，你很爱圣母犸丽 对不对啊？
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

321
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,750
长官，不对，长官
Sir, negative, sir.

322
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,410
小丑大兵 你想忤逆我？
Private Joker, are you trying to offend me?

323
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,920
长官，不对，长官
Sir, negative, sir.

324
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,150
长官，我认为无论我怎么回答 都是错的
Sir, the private believes that any answer he gives will be wrong...

325
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,220
而且如果说反话 会被士官长打得更惨，长官
...and the senior drill instructor will beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

326
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,960
你的小队长是谁，垃圾？
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

- He'll teach you how to pee. - Sir, yes, sir.

小丑大兵是很笨、很无知 不过他很带种，这就够了
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.

338
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,790
你们这些娘娘，快行动了
Now, you ladies, carry on.

339

然后你就会身陷狗屎世界

380
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,390

382

383

傻瓜大兵 让自己蒙羞

436
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,150
让这一排蒙羞

我一直想帮他 不过我失败了
I have tried to help him, but I have failed.

438
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,360
我失败了 因为你们没有帮我
I have failed because you have not helped me.

439
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,600
你们没有适时的给予傻瓜大兵
You people have not given Private Pyle...

440
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,970
适当的激励

441
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,640
所以从现在起 只要傻瓜大兵搞砸了
So from now on, whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,890
右肩
Right shoulder.

653
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,260
关保险、装子弹
Lock and load.

654
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,430
立定
Order.

655
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,070
这是我的步枪
This is my rifle.

656
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,000
同样款式的很多 不过这一把是我的
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

657
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,580
我的步枪是我的好朋友 枪是我的命
My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.

658
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,240
回你们床上去
Get back in your bunks.

659
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,580
你们在耍什么猴戏？
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

660
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:09,610
你们这两个浑球 跑到我的厕所来干什么？
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ are you animals doing in my head?

661
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,120
傻瓜天兵在熄灯后 为什么不在他的床上？
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk after lights out?

662
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,130
傻瓜天兵为什么拿着武器？
Why is Private Pyle holding that weapon?

663
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,650
你为什么没狠狠的 踹傻瓜天兵一顿？
Why aren't you stomping Private Pyle's guts out?

664
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,030
长官，我有义务向您报告
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform the senior drill instructor...

665
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,940
傻瓜天兵持有装满子弹的枪 而且子弹已上膛了，长官
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine and has locked and loaded, sir.

666
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,250
你给我听着，傻瓜天兵
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

667
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,180
你给我好好的听
...and you listen good.

668
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,890
我要那把枪
I want that weapon...

669
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,690
我现在就要
...and I want it now.

670
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,460
你把步枪放在脚边的地板上
You will place that rifle on the deck at your feet...

671
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,470
然后退后
...and step back away from it.

672
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,400
你到底有什么重大创伤，笨蛋？
What is your major malfunction, numb-nuts?

673
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,850
童年时 你父母不够关心你吗？
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you enough attention when you were a child?

674
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,470
别激动，雷诺
Easy, Leonard.

675
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:44,010
不要激动，老兄
Go easy, man.

676
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,940
不！
No!

677
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,100
嘿，宝贝
Hey, baby.

678
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,300
有越南女朋友吗？
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

679
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,100
现在没有
Not just this minute.

680
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,580
哦，宝贝，我很浪
Well, baby, me so horny.

681
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,910
我很浪
Me so horny.

682
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,640
我爱你久久
Me love you long time.

683
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,420
要玩吗？
You party?

684
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,720
也许要
Yeah, we might party.

685
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,690
-多少钱？ -十五块美金
- How much? - Fifteen dollar.

686
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,890
-我们两个总共十五块 -不，一个人十五块
- Fifteen dollars for both of us. - No. Each you $ 15.

687
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,990
我会爱你久久
Me love you long time.

688
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,800
我很浪
Me so horny.

689
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,270
十五块太多了
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

690
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,700
-一人五块钱 -我吸吸
- Five dollars each. - Me sucky-sucky.

691
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,470
我太爱你
Me love you too much.

692
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,180
我妈只准我花五块钱
Five dollars is all my mom allows me to spend.

693
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,270
好，一人十块钱
Okay. Ten dollar each.

694
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,940
十块钱能怎样？
What do we get for $ 10?

695
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,920
统统可以
Everything you want.

696
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,260
-统统可以？ -统统可以
- Everything? - Everything.

697
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,390
兄弟，想花辛苦赚来的银子吗？
Well, old buddy, feel like spending some of your hard-earned money?

698
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,460
等一下
Just a minute.

699
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,930
这些亚裔妓女 半数都是帮越共军官在服务
You know, half these gook whores are serving officers in the Vietcong.

700
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,870
另一半则有肺结核
The other half have got TB.

701
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,570
只能找没有咳嗽的
Be sure you only fuck the ones that cough.

702
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,540
（禁止进入）

703
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,500
（欢迎加入 海军陆战队一师）

704
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,740
（岘港美国海军陆战队）

705
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,230
那小浑球的动作真的不错 对吧？
That little sucker really had some moves on him, didn't he?

706
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,060
对
Yeah.

707
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,460
知道这些人让我最火的 是什么吗？
You know what really pisses me off about these people?

708
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,970
什么？
What?

709
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,990
我们是来协助他们的 他们却一逮到机会就整我们
We're supposed to be helping them, and they shit all over us every chance they get.

710
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,130
我真的想不通
I just can't feature that.

711
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,770
别太在意，劳特曼 只是公事公办
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman. It's just business.

712
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,940
我讨厌岘港，小丑 我想上战场
I hate Da Nang, Joker. I wanna go out into the field.

713
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,080
我来这基地都快三个月了
I've been in country almost three months...

714
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,020
做的全都是在颁奖典礼上 拍一些握手的照片
...and all I do is take handshake shots at award ceremonies.

715
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,220
你一进入战场就会被干掉 那就会是我的责任了
You'd get wasted your first day in the field and it'd be my fault.

716
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,690
我这种工作 高中女生就会做
A high school girl could do my job.

717
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,660
我要到前线去
I wanna get out into the shit.

718
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,430
我要拍一些枪战的划面
I wanna get some trigger time.

719
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,830
如果你被杀了 等我重返美国，你妈就会找到我
If you get killed, your mom will find me after I rotate back to the world...

720
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,770
她会海扁我一顿
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.

721
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,430
不行的，劳特曼
That's a negative, Rafterman.

722
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:07,970
（最先走的最后知道）
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet today. Anybody got anything new?

723
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,140
好，各位，我们今天就简短轻松点 谁有新闻吗？

724
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,150
有谣传说 新春停火协议将会取消
There's a rumor going around that the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

725
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,080
后方指挥所妄想症
Rear-echelon paranoia.

726
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,560
有个搞情报的兄弟说 越共可能会在新春期间搞个大的
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try to pull off something big during Tet.

727
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,220
他们每年都这样说
They say the same thing every year.

728
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:29,160
传的很厉害，长官
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

729
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,130
我不会为此失眠
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

730
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,470
他们的新春假期就像我们的国庆 圣诞、新年假期全加在一起一样
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July, Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

731
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,000
战场上每一个越南人 无论北越或南越都会敲锣打鼓
Every zipperhead in Nam, North and South, will be banging gongs...

732
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,030
大吼大叫的 还要去探望他们死去的亲人
...barking at the moon and visiting his dead relatives.

733
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:45,800
对，下星期安犸格莉特 跟她的劳军团会来
Right. Ann-Margret and entourage are due here next week.

734
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,250
我要有人在机场待命 跟着她几天
I want someone on the airfield and stick with her for a couple of days.

735
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,910
-劳特曼，就你了 -遵命，长官
- Rafterman, you take it. - Aye, aye, sir.

736
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,750
拍一些低角度的好东东出来
And get some good low-angle stuff.

737
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:57,990
别太明显 不过我想看到有露毛的
Don't make it too obvious, but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

738
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,430
-是，长官 -穿着工作服的外交使节
- Yes, sir. - "Diplomats in dungarees.

739
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,300
海军陆战队工兵团 最近协助重建东宝村K
Marine engineers lend a helping hand rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."

740
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,770
辣椒，如果我们主动移动越南人 他们就是被疏散的人
Chili, if we move Vietnamese, they are evacuees...

741
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,030
如果他们主动来找我们撤离 那就是难民
...if they come to us to be evacuated, they are refugees.

742
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,970
我会记录下来的，长官
I'll make a note of it, sir.

743
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,170
一名北越正规军 在阅读小手册后逃兵
"NVA soldier deserts after reading pamphlets.

744
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,380
一名年轻的北越正规军 在阅读劝降小册子后
A young North Vietnamese Army regular, who realized his side could not win...

745
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,350
明白他们不可能赢 于是就从其服役之单位逃走
...deserted from his unit after reading Open Arms pamphlets."

746
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,620
很好，大卫，可是 干嘛特别说北越常规军？
That's good, Dave. But why say North Vietnamese Army regular?

747
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,520
他们有非常规军吗？ 何不写成北越的士兵就好？
Is there an irregular? How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

748
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,750
我会改的，长官
I'll fix it up, sir.

749
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,220
再两星期《劳伦斯韦克秀》 就要在电视上播放了
<i>Lawrence Welk Show</i> is out on TV in two weeks.

750
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,560
大卫，写一百字谈谈这节目
Dave, do 100 words on it.

751
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,260
-AFTV电视台会给你一些背景资料 -是
- AFTV will give you some background stuff. - Sir.

752
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,200
别吵我们吃东西
"Not while we're eating.

753
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,900
北越军方得知海军陆战队 在进行搜寻摧毁任务时
NVA learned Marines on a search-and-destroy mission...

754
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,410
不喜欢在吃东西时被打扰
...don't like to be interrupted while eating chow."

755
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,470
搜寻摧毁 三军总部对这名词有新的指示
Search-and-destroy. We have a new directive from MAF on this.

756
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:54,240
未来，要以大扫除 取代搜寻摧毁这个名词
In future, in place of search-and-destroy, substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

757
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,720
-大扫除，懂了吗？ -懂了，很容易记
- Sweep-and-clear, got it? - Got it. Very catchy.

758
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,820
还有，小丑，不幸的呢？
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

759
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,950
什么？
Sir?

760
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,050
杀戮面，小丑 步兵强大的火力一定有伤到什么
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire, the grunts must have hit something.

761
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,500
没看到
Didn't see them.

762
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,930
小丑，我说过了 我们这里有两种基本故事
Joker, I've told you, we run two basic stories here.

763
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,560
步兵拿一半的薪水给这里的人民 买牙刷和芳香剂
Grunts who give half their pay to buy gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

764
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,010
赢取身心灵，好吗？
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

765
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,770
还有就是血腥的战斗情节 要打赢战争
And combat action that results in a kill. Winning the war.

766
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,650
你一定有看到血迹 例如拖行的血痕？
Now, you must have seen blood trails. Drag marks?

767
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,480
当时在下雨，长官
It was raining, sir.

768
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:31,820
哦，所以上帝才会发明 “可能性”这个名词
Well, that's why God passed the law of probability.

769
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:35,090
给我重写，再给个快乐结局 比如，一人死亡
Now rewrite it and give it a happy ending. Say, one killed.

770
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,630
就让狙击手或某军官牺牲了 看哪个较好
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

771
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,460
悉听尊命
Whichever you say.

772
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,120
步兵喜欢阅读 有军官死的故事
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

773
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,500
好，那就军官 来个将军如何？
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

774
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,270
小丑K
Joker...

775
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,830
也许你宁愿让我们的人读报时 感到不安
...maybe you'd like our guys to read the paper and feel bad.

776
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,140
我是指，也许你还不明白 这可不是很受欢迎的战争
I mean, in case you didn't know it, this is not a very popular war.

777
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,440
我们有义务报导
Now, it is our job to report the news...

778
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,680
那些“我们干嘛打”的平民记者 忽略的新闻
...that these why-are-we-here civilian newsmen ignore.

779
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,050
长官，也许你该亲自上战场去
Sir, maybe you should go out on some ops yourself.

780
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,950
我相信你一定可以找到 更多血迹跟血痕
I'm sure you could find a lot more blood trails and drag marks.

781
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,550
小丑，我也有过冲锋陷阵的日子
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

782
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,690
我并不喜欢
Can't say I liked it much.

783
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:15,860
蚊虫一堆也很危险
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

784
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,060
如今我目前的职责 让我在属于我的地方
As it happens, my present duties keep me where I belong...

785
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,430
也就是拥有各种补给的后方
...in the rear with the gear.

786
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:31,950
越南的新年 猴年
<i>Tet. The year of the monkey.</i>

787
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,250
越南人的农历除夕
<i>Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.</i>

788
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,520
在战俘营，有越共在放烟火庆祝
<i>Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are</i> <i>shooting off fireworks to celebrate.</i>

789
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,900
我快无聊死了，老天
I am fucking bored to death, man.

790
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,000
我得回到战场才行
I gotta get back in the shit.

791
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,240
我有好几个星期 没听到有人开枪了
I ain't heard a shot fired in anger in weeks.

792
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,410
小丑很悍K
Joker's so tough...

793
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:05,040
他会吃下死人鼻子上的鼻屎干
...he'd eat the boogers out of a dead man's nose...

794
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,110
以争取时间
...then ask for seconds.

795
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,680
给我听好，清教徒
Listen up, pilgrim.

796
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:14,350
没有血的日子 就像失去阳光一样
A day without blood is like a day without sunshine.

797
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,120
靠
Shit.

798
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,190
小丑认为最危险的地带 就是老妈妈桑的双腿之间了
Joker thinks the bad bush is between an old mama-san's legs.

799
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,290
他根本没到过前线
He's never been in the shit.

800
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,200
很难形容的 就像哈斯汀之役
It's hard to talk about it, man. It's like on Hastings.

801
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,900
你又没参与哈斯汀之行，小背
You weren't on Operation Hastings, Payback.

802
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,740
-你连战地都没去过 -去你妈的K
- You weren't even in country. - Eat shit and die...

803
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,770
你这该死的西班牙裔美国人 该死的后备军
...you fucking Spanish-American. You fucking pogue.

804
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,350
我有参与那一仗
I was there, man.

805
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,240
我就跟步兵团在战场上
I was in the shit with the grunts.

806
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,200
别听小背在鬼扯，劳特曼
Don't listen to any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

807
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:44,780
他有时候会自以为是约翰韦恩
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

808
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,980
你听小丑的，菜鸟？
You listen to Joker, new guy.

809
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,750
他只懂一点鸡毛蒜皮
He knows <i>tí ti</i>.

810
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,450
一点点
Very little.

811
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,430
大家都看得出他没上过前线 他没有那种眼神
You know he's never been in the shit. He ain't got the stare.

812
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,130
-什么眼神？ -一万码的眼神
- The stare? - The thousand-yard stare.

813
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,300
在前线待久的海军陆战队员 都会有那种眼神
A Marine gets it after he's been in the shit for too long.

814
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,000
就像K
It's like...

815
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,300
就像可以穿透的眼神
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

816
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,270
我有
I got it.

817
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,280
所有在战地的海陆队员都有
All field Marines got it.

818
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,940
未来，你们大家也都会有
And you'll have it too.

819
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,410
我会有？
I will?

820
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,140
嘿，小背K
Hey, Payback...

821
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,410
你要如何阻止五个黑人 强奸一个白妞？
...how do you stop five black dudes from raping a white chick?

822
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,910
-去你妈的，大鸟 -给他们一颗篮球就行了
- Fuck you, Stork. - Throw them a basketball.

823
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,020
-有人来了 -哦，靠

826
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,570
我刚刚是怎么说的？
Now, what did I just say?

827
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,910
嘿，但愿他们只是闹着我们玩的
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

828
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,350
-我还没做好准备 -阿门
- I ain't ready for this shit. - Amen.

829
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,160
停火
Cease fire.

830
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,370
-停火 -停火
- Cease fire. - Cease fire.

831

停火
Cease fire.

832
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,990
敌军K
<i>The enemy...</i>

833
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,660
很狡诈的
<i>... has very deceitfully...</i>

834
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,690
利用新春停火协议占点便宜

835
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:50,210

<i>... to launch an offensive</i> <i>all over the country.</i>

836
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,210
到目前为止 我们这地带还是很轻松的
<i>So far, we've had it pretty easy here.</i>

837
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,580
不过，似乎只有我们这里例外
<i>But we seem to be the exception.</i>

838
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,070
越共狠狠的攻打越南 每一座主要的军事基地
Charlie has hit every major military target in Vietnam and hit them hard.

839
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:08,110

溪山也快失陷
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

In strategic terms, Charlie's cut the country in half...

849
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,130
长官
Sir.

850
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,290
这是否意谓着 安犸格莉特不来了？
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's not coming?

851
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:58,460

...you will take off that damn button.

How's it gonna look if you get killed wearing a peace symbol?

856
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,010

01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,120
北越军很会躲
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

913
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,820
我们这一连 还在河这一面努力
Hotel Company's still working this side of the river...

914
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,190
一街一街、一屋一屋的找
...street by street and house by house.

915
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,360
越共绝对会坚守目前的成果
Charles definitely got his shit together...

916
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,800
不过我们这里 铁定还要大打几场
...but we're still getting some decent kills here.

917
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,170
我们有听到一些风声，长官 听说北越军处决很多平民
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

918
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,770
没错
That's affirmative.

919
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,570
我在半公里外有看到一些尸体 就在普康运河这一边
I saw some bodies about a half a klick this side of Phu Cam Canal.

920
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,910
可以把地方指给我看吗？
Will you show me where, sir?

921
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,840
这是运河
Here's the canal.

922
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,850
（天生杀手）

923
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,000
死者已用石灰覆盖
<i>The dead have been covered with lime.</i>

924
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,070
死者只知道一件事
<i>The dead know only one thing:</i>

925
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,270
好死不如歹活
<i>It is better to be alive.</i>

926
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,180
对不起？
Excuse me?

927
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,620
-早，军官 -早安
- Good morning, lieutenant. - Morning.

928
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,360
我算是20 这是官方的死亡数字吗？
I make it 20. Is that the official body count, sir?

929
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,970
你们是哪个部队的？
What outfit are you men with?

930
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,260
长官，我们是《星条旗》的记者
Sir, we're reporters from <i>Stars and Stripes</i>.

931
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,060
-哦，我懂了 -我是小丑中士
- Oh, I see. - I'm Sergeant Joker...

932
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,540
这位摄影师是劳特曼
...and this photographer is Rafterman.

933
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,300
我是克利佛中尉 我是康D狄克哈特福来的
I'm Lieutenant Cleves and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

934
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,400
-你有统计死亡人数吗？ -我们认为是20人
- Have you got a body count, sir? - We think it's 20.

935
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,670
你知道是怎么发生的吗，长官？
Do you know how it happened, sir?

936
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,820
哦，北越军似乎有一张平民的清单
Well, it seems the NVA came in with a list of gook names.

937
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:19,550
有政府官员、警察 南越军人、老师
Government officials, policemen, ARVIN officers, school teachers.

938
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,720
他们很客气的到这些人的家里
They went around to their houses real polite...

939
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:25,230
请这些人在隔天 前去接受政治再教育
...and asked them to report the next day for political reeducation.

940
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,000
去的全被射杀了
Everybody who turned up got shot.

941
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:29,790
有些被活埋
Some they buried alive.

942
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,330
注意
Ready.

943
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,370
上校
Colonel.

944
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,600
陆战队员 你军服上的是什么别章？
Marine, what is that button on your body armor?

945
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,040
是和平的象征，长官
A peace symbol, sir.

946
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,810
-你去哪里拿来的？ -我不记得了，长官
- Where did you get it? - I don't remember, sir.

947
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,110
你钢盔上写的是什么？
What is that written on your helmet?

948
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,770
天生杀手，长官
Born to kill, sir.

949
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,940
你在钢盔上写天生杀手 然后再别个和平别章
You write born to kill on your helmet and wear a peace button.

950
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,450
这算什么？ 某种烂笑话吗？
What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?

951
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,180
-不，长官 -那是什么意思呢？
- No, sir. - What is it supposed to mean?

952
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,730
我不知道，长官
I don't know, sir.

953
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,390
-你什么都不懂 -是，长官
- You don't know much. - No, sir.

954
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,800
你最好给我身心灵一致 不然我就恶整你
Get your head and your ass wired together or I will take a shit on you.

955
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,700
-是，长官 -现在回答我的问题
- Yes, sir. - Now answer my question...

956
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:06,240
不然你就给我站着
...or you'll be standing tall before the man.

957
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,360
我是想提出人的双重性，长官
I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir.

958
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,140
-什么？ -人的双重性，就是荣格的学说
- The what? - The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

959
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,580
-你是哪一边的，孩子？ -我们这边的，长官
- Whose side are you on, son? - Our side, sir.

960
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,380
-你爱你的国家吗？ -是的，长官
- You love your country? - Yes, sir.

961
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,140
那就顺着计划走如何？
How about getting with the program.

962
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,740
加入团队一起打场胜仗
Jump on the team and come on in for the big win.

963
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,950
是，长官
Yes, sir.

964
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,580
我对我的陆战队员只有一个要求 要把我的命令当成上帝的旨意
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would God's word.

965
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,490
我们是来此协助越南人民
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

966
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,590
因为每一个亚洲人民的体内 都孕育着一股想逃出的美国精神
...because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out.

967
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,430
世道艰难，孩子
It's a hardball world, son.

968
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,230
我们必须保持清醒 直到这股和平狂风消失
We've gotta try to keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.

969
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,430
遵命，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

970
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,610
嘿，兄弟，我们要找第一排 二五军
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon, Hotel Two-Five.

971
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,580

Around the back.

972
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,290
-第一排？ -是，穿过那里
- First Platoon? - Yeah, through there.

973

01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,760
-我的妈，是小丑 -你这老欠扁的
- Holy shit. It's the Joker. - You old motherfucker.

975
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,830
怎么一回事？
What's happening?

976
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:52,830
我还以为再也看不到你了 你这混蛋
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again, you piece of shit.

977
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,870
还好吗，老兄？
What's happening, man?

978
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,440
哦，就是在等着 回到有商店的基地
Oh, just waiting to get back to the land of the big PX.

979
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,570
是吗？干嘛回去？
Yeah? Well, why go back?

980
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,280
这里或那里 不全都一样？
Here or there, samey-same.

981
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,150
-有上什么人吗？ -只玩你妹子
- Been getting any? - Only your sister.

982
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,420
哦，玩我妹总比玩我娘好 虽然我娘也不差
Well, better my sister than my mom, though my mom's not bad.

983
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:11,620
嘿，你们这些猪头，听好
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

984
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,960
这是我在训练基地的兄弟，小丑 这位是K？
This is my bro, Joker, from the Island, and this is...?

985
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,090
-劳特曼 -劳特曼
- Rafterman. - Rafterman.

They're from <i>Stars and Stripes</i>. They'll make you famous.

987
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,570
-酷 -对
- Fucking A. - Yeah.

988
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,660
我们是种猪小队
We're the Lusthog Squad.

989
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,400
我们是取人性命 碎人心脏的人
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

990
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,070
我们会把人打穿好几个洞 用铅把人塞满
We shoot them full of holes and fill them full of lead.

991
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,220
你是摄影师？
You a photographer?

992
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,220
不，我是战地记者
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

993

哦，你见识过很多战役？

994
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,830
哦，在电视上看过一些
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

995

你真的很搞笑
You're a real comedian.

996
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,940
大家都叫我小丑
Well, they call me the Joker.

997
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,710
哦，我给你来个笑话
Well, I got a joke for you.

998
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:08,120
我要剥了你的屁屁 送给你一个全新的
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

999
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,190
哦，清教徒
Well, pilgrim...

1000
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,490

...only after you eat the peanuts out of my shit.

1001

你说是有一套
You talk the talk.

1002
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:30,040
不过，你有种做吗？
Do you walk the walk?

1003
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:35,940
你也许很难相信
Now, you might not believe it...

1004
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:41,380
不过在战场上 妖兽算是世上最好的人了
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of the finest human beings in the world.

1005
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:45,680
他这下半生 就缺有个人对他扔手榴弹
All he needs is somebody to throw hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

1006
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:50,020
知道了，得了 来坐坐，来，菜鸟
That's a roger, come on. Sit down. Come on, new guy.

1007

嘿，黑佬
Hey, jungle-bunny.

1008
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,000
还好有黑人出面，是吧？
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

1009
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,000
对啊，妖兽
Yeah, Mother.

1010

嘿，照相的

这是我弟兄
This is my bro.

1015

现在是他的派对
This is his party.

1016
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,770
他是我们的贵宝
He's the guest of honor.

1017

我永远不会忘了这一天
I will never forget this day.

1020

这进入顺化城 跟一百万名北越人民对战的日子
The day I came to Hue City and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

1021
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,420
我爱这小共杂碎，天啊 我真的爱
I love the little commie bastards, man, I really do.

1022
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,130
这些敌人的步兵 跟斜眼的士官长一样难缠
These enemy grunts are as hard as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1023
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,060
我们还活着是很伟大的，兄弟们
These are great days we're living, bros.

1024
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,230
我们是快乐的绿巨人 我们带着枪在大地行走
We are jolly green giants, walking the earth with guns.

今天牺牲的这些人
These people we wasted here today...

1026

1027
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,240
等我们重返民间
After we rotate back to the world...

1028
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,720
我们会想像没人值得射杀的日子
...we're gonna miss not having anyone around who's worth shooting.

1029
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:32,850
-别动，头压低 -别动
- Stay put, keep your heads down. - Stay put.

1030
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,650

是你吗，约翰韦恩？ 还是我？
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1045
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,870
嘿，开始拍 这是电影版的《越南》
Hey, start the cameras. This is <i>Vietnam: The Movie</i>.

- I'll be General Custer. - Who'll be the Indian?

1050
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:27,220
嘿，就让越南人当印第安人
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the Indians.

1051
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,390
你们要回家了
You're going home now.

1052
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,240
忠贞爱国
Semper fi.

1053
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:18,800
我们是强悍的海军陆战队，长官
We're mean Marines, sir.

1054
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,310
安详的去，兄弟
Go easy, bros.

1055
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,510
还好不是我
Better you than me.

1056
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:36,890
哦，最少他们是为理念而牺牲
Well, at least they died for a good cause.

1057
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,930
什么理念？
What cause was that?

1058
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:42,990
自由
Freedom.

1059
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,730
你醒醒吧，菜鸟
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1060
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,300
你认为我们是为了自由杀越共？
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1061
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:54,640
这是一场屠杀
This is a slaughter.

1062
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,410
如果要我为了一句话被炸到爆
If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word...

1063
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:03,380
那一定就是“女人”

小慰完全崩溃了

He was all set to get shipped out on a medical.

1066
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:16,720
他到底怎么了？
What was the matter with him?

1067
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:22,270
他一天打枪十次
He was jerking off 10 times a day.

1068
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:26,970
不是开玩笑的 最少十次
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.

1069
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:34,240
上星期他被送到岘港 去看海军的精神科医生
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang to see the Navy head shrinker.

1070
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:38,720
这神经病就在候诊室玩起来了
The crazy fucker starts jerking off in the waiting room.

1071
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,820
马上因精神异常可以离役
Instant Section Eight.

1072
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,920
他就等离开师部的文件了
He was just waiting for his papers to clear Division.

1073
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,290
准备好了？转过来
You ready? Turn over.

1074
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,140
顺化采访，34卷
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1075
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,240
就像K就像大家看到的 这是一座大城
Well, like... Like you see, you know, it's a major city...

1076
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:04,940
所以我们得以坦克攻击 我们沿街推进
...so we have to assault with tanks, we roll in the streets.

1077
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,510
所以他们派我们先去侦察
So they send us in first to squat...

1078
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:11,420
确定那里没有小K
...make sure that there are no little...

1079
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,790
没有越南人拿B40火箭跑 等着把坦克炸飞
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets to blow the tanks away.

1080
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,450
所以我们就清除障碍 让坦克进去K
So we clear it out and we roll the tanks in...

1081
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,960
基本上就是把这地方夷为平地
...and basically blow the place to hell.

1082
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:25,160
我们到顺化时 我们进顺化城时K
When we're in Hue, when we're in Hue City...

1083
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,290
就像一场战役，就是K
...it's like a war, you know...

1084
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,360
像我所K我所K
...like what... What...

1085
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,530
我所认定的战役 我所认定的战役K
What I thought about a war, what I thought a war was...

1086
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:35,200
那种规模
You know, was supposed to be.

1087
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:38,580
有敌军在 所以要杀了他们
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1088
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:42,310
我不认为有什么问题 我们是最好的
I don't think there's any question about it. I mean, we're the best.

1089
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:44,620
大家都在谈航空骑兵队
I mean, all that bullshit about the Air Cav...

1090
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,920
不过飞机故障后 他们会找谁？
When the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

1091
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:50,430
会找海军陆战队 还有这些杀人机器
They call Mother Green and her killing machine.

1092
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,590
我认为美国是否该到越南来？
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1093
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:58,190
我不知道 我属于越南，我可以这样说
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1094
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:00,600
我可以引詹森的话吗？
Can I quote LBJ?

1095
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,630
我不会派美国男孩K
"I will not send American boys...

1096
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:08,080
跑到八千或一万里外的国度
...8 or 10,000 miles around the world...

1097
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:12,450
去做一件亚洲男孩 应该自己去执行的任务
...to do a job that Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves."

1098
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:18,680
个人觉得他们不是 真的想涉入这场战争
Personally think they don't really want to be involved in this war...

1099
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:22,620
我是指，就像他们 有点像K
...you know, I mean, like they... It's sort of like...

1100
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,550
他们取走我们的自由 再转交给越南人民
...they took away our freedom and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1101
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,290
但是他们不想要
But they don't want it.

1102
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,890
我猜，他们宁可活着也不要自由
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess, you know.

1103
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,060
可怜又愚蠢的家伙
Poor, dumb bastards.

1104
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:38,670
哦，我打的是一些 很K很坏的人
Well, the ones I'm fighting at are some pretty... Pretty bad boys.

1105
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,610
我不是很K
I'm not real...

1106
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,610
我不是很在乎这些K
I'm not real keen on some of these fellas...

1107
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,210
原本应该跟我们站在同一边的人
...that are supposedly on our side.

1108
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:51,220
我老是撞见他们 从另一个阵营过来
I keep meeting them coming the other way.

1109
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:54,320
对
Yeah.

1110
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,090
我们为这些人民牺牲K
I mean, we're getting killed for these people...

1111
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,420
他们却根本不感激
...and they don't even appreciate it.

1112
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,020
他们觉得这场战争 是个大笑话
They think it's a big joke.

1113
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:04,660
哦，问我的话
Well, if you ask me...

1114
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:07,160
这些越南人 我们打错边了
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1115
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:11,170
哦，得看情况而定 我是来这里拍战斗照的
Well, it depends on the situation. I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1116
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,910
不过，战况激烈的话 我也会用步枪
But if the shit gets too thick, I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1117
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,680
我对美国涉入这场战争的看法？
What do I think about America's involvement in the war?

1118
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,620
哦，我觉得我们应该要打赢
Well, I think we should win.

1119
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,250
我讨厌越南
I hate Vietnam.

1120
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,450
这整个国家没有一匹马
There's not one horse in this whole country.

1121
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:27,750
他们这里连一匹马也没
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1122
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:30,520
基本上，这是很不对劲的
There's something basically wrong with that.

1123
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,890
哦，如果能派更多的人来，也许K
Well, if they'd send us more guys, maybe...

1124
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:38,090
也许把北越炸到翻 他们就会投降
...and bomb the hell out of the North, they might give up.

1125
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:44,400
我原想看到异国风情的越南 这个东南亚之珠
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam, the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1126
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:49,370
我想遇见来自古老文化 风趣又刺激的人民
I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1127
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:50,850
再杀了他们
...and kill them.

1128
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,110
我原想成为我家那一带青年 第一个取得正式杀人记录的人
I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill.

- Cowboy. - Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1326

把他带开
