00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:32,209
"America has heard the bugle call

2
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:40,387
"And you know it involves us one and all

"I don 't suppose that war will ever end

"I'm here to take a battle to be won

"Good-bye, my sweetheart
Hello, Vietnam "

9
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:38,515
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

10
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:41,719
You will speak only when spoken to.

11
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:45,648
The first and last words
out of your sewers will be "Sir! "

12
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:47,589
Do you maggots understand?

13
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:49,192
Sir, yes, sir!

14
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:52,628
I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

15
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:58,361
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

16
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:03,173
...you will be a weapon,
a minister of death, praying for war.

17
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:06,102
But until that day, you are pukes!

18
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:08,844
The lowest form of life on Earth.

19
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,311
You are not even human fucking beings!

20
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:15,986
You are only unorganized,
grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit!

21
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,316
Because I am hard, you won't like me.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
The more you hate me,
the more you'll learn.

23
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,528
I am hard, but I am fair!

24
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:26,923
There is no racial bigotry here!

25
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:31,101
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

26
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:33,665
Here, you are all equally worthless!

27
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,766
My orders are to weed out non-hackers...

28
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:39,078
...who do not pack the gear
to be in my beloved Corps!

29
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,313
Do you maggots understand that?

30
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,713
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

31
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:51,489
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

32
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:55,219
From now on you're Private Snowball!
Like that name?

33
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:56,657
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,231
There's one thing you won't like!

35
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,693
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

36
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:04,427
...in my mess hall!

37
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,698
Is that you, John Wayne?

38
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:08,975
Is this me?

39
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,602
Who said that?

40
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,012
Who the fuck said that?

41
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:16,945
Who's the slimy communist cocksucker
down here...

42
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:19,517
...who just signed his own death warrant?

43
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,447
Nobody, huh?

44
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,923
The fairy fucking godmother said it!

45
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:27,755
Out-fucking-standing!
I will P.T. you all until you die!

46
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,927
I will P.T. you until your assholes
suck buttermilk!

47
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,760
Was it you, you little fuck?

48
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:38,305
You look like a fucking worm!
I bet it was you!

49
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:40,771
Sir, I said it, sir!

50
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,142
Well, no shit.

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,872
What are you, a fucking comedian?
Private Joker.

52
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,840
I admire your honesty.

53
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,716
I like you. Come over to my house
and fuck my sister!

54
00:03:56,557 --> 00:04:00,550
You little scumbag! I've got your name!
I've got your ass!

55
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:02,863
You will not laugh or cry!

56
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:05,529
You will learn by the number!

57
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,460
Get up! Get on your feet!

58
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:12,898
Unfuck yourself or I'll unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!

59
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:17,733
-Why did you join my beloved Corps?
-Sir, to kill, sir!

60
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:19,274
You're a killer!

61
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,541
Let me see your war face!

62
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,906
You've got a war face?

63
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:28,144
That's a war face! Let me see yours!

64
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,957
You didn't convince me!
Let me see your real war face!

65
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:36,896
You don't scare me! Work on it!

66
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,061
What's your excuse?

67
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,565
Sir, excuse, sir?

68
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:43,635
I'm asking the fucking questions,
understand?

69
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,403
Thank you!
Can I be in charge for a while?

70
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:51,406
Are you shook up? Nervous?

71
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,703
Sir, I am, sir!

72
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,380
Do I make you nervous?

73
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,407
Were you about to call me an asshole?

74
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,744
-How tall are you, Private?
-Sir, 5'9", sir!

75
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,948
I didn't know they stacked shit that high!

76
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,660
Trying to squeeze an inch in on me, huh?

77
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:12,230
The best part of you ran down
the crack of your mama's ass...

78
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,130
...and ended up as a brown stain
on the mattress!

79
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,266
Where in hell are you from?

80
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,109
Holy dogshit! Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy!

81
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,709
You don't look like a steer,
so that narrows it down!

82
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,309
Suck dicks?

83
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:31,682
You a peter-puffer?

84
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,187
I bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,620
...and not have the courtesy
to give him a reach-around!

86
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,718
I'll be watching you!

87
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:45,158
Your parents have children that lived?

88
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,431
Bet they regret that!

89
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:50,297
You're so ugly
you're a modern-art masterpiece!

90
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,131
-What's your name, fatbody?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!

91
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,103
Lawrence, what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,937
That name sounds like royalty!
You royalty?

93
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,241
You suck dicks?

94
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:05,277
Bet you could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,083
I don't like that name!
Faggots and sailors are called Lawrence!

96
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,288
From now on you're Gomer Pyle!

97
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,855
Think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
Think I'm funny?

98
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:19,058
Then wipe off that disgusting grin!

99
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:23,359
Any fucking time, sweetheart!

100
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm trying, sir!

101
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,266
I'll give you three seconds...

102
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,599
...exactly three fucking seconds...

103
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:32,175
...to wipe off that stupid grin...

104
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:36,344
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you!

105
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:43,014
-Sir, I can't help it, sir!
-Get on your knees, scumbag!

106
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:46,957
Now choke yourself!

107
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,122
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts!

108
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,463
Don't pull my hand over there!

109
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:58,036
I said choke yourself!
Lean forward and choke yourself!

110
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,800
Are you through grinning?

111
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,008
Bullshit! I can't hear you!

112
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,974
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!
Sound off like you got a pair!

113
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:17,922
That's enough. Get on your feet!

114
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:25,728
Pyle, square your ass away and
start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

115
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,396
...or I will definitely fuck you up!

116
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:42,211
Parris lsland, South Carolina ...

117

...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

An eight-week college

Left shoulder, hut!

131
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:01,086
What are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

132
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:02,319
Sir, I don't know, sir!

133
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:07,365
Do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

134
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:12,131
You did that on purpose!
You want to be different!

135
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,768
-What side was that?
-Sir, left side, sir!

136
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:17,943
Are you sure, Private Pyle?

137
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:21,608
What side was that?

138
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,214
Sir, right side, sir!

139
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,811
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle!

140
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,881
Pick up your fucking cover!

141
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,685
Tonight, you pukes will sleep
with your rifles!

142
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,591
You will give your rifle a girl's name!

143
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:12,731
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get!

144
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,796
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

pink panties are over!

You're married to this piece...

...this weapon of iron and wood!

148
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,875
And you will be faithful!

149
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,147
Prepare to mount!

150
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,606
Pray!

151

00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,669
"I must shoot him before he shoots me.

161
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:28,972
"I will.

162
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:32,177
"Before God I swear this creed.

163
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:35,980
"My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

164
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,508
"We are the masters of our enemy.

165
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,046
"We are the saviors of my life.

166
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:42,612
"So be it...

167
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,553
"...until there is no enemy, but peace.

168
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:46,891
"Amen."

169
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:54,765
At ease!

170
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,769
Good night, ladies!

171
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:02,073
Hit it!

172
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,713
This is not your daddy's shotgun,
Cowboy!

173
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,761
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle!

174
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,969
Four inches from your chest, Pyle!

175
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,398
Four inches!

176
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,379
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

177
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,911
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun!

178
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,718
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

179
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,444
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun! "

180
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:10,840
You're bouncing!

181
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,186
Ten fucking seconds!

182
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:32,765
It should take you ten seconds
to negotiate this obstacle!

183
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:34,866
Quickly, move it out!

184
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:38,534
No swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

185
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:42,808
...until they get this obstacle down
to less than ten fucking seconds!

186
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,397
Next two! Quickly!

187
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:11,201
Get over that goddamn obstacle!
Move it!

188
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,407
Private Joker, are you a killer?

189
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:19,936
Let me hear your war cry!

190
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:25,316
Get your fat ass over there!

191
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,417
That's right, Private Pyle...

192
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:31,887
...don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top!

193
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:36,995
If God wanted you up there,
He'd have miracled your ass up there!

194
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,989
Get your fat ass up there!

195
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,168
What the hell's wrong with you?

196
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:47,602
If there was some pussy up there,
you could get up there, couldn't you?

197
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:52,542
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum, Pyle.

198
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,541
One for the commandant!

199
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,617
One for the Corps!

200
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,249
Get up there!

201
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:05,489
Pull!

202
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,626
The Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, Pyle!

203
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,360
Pull!

204
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:13,197
Pull, Pyle, pull!

205
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,132
One pull-up, Pyle! Come on, pull!

206
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:19,568
You've got to be shitting me!
Get your ass up there!

207
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,607
Do you mean to tell me you cannot do
one single pull-up?

208
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,944
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle!
Get out of my face!

209
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,139
Get up there, Snowball.

210
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,246
Get up here, fatboy!

211
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,282
Quickly! Move it up, Pyle! Move it up!

212
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,020
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

213
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,023
Get up here! You're too slow! Move it!

214
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:48,357
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down!

215
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:50,627
That would break my fucking heart!

216
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,238
Quickly! Up and over! Up and over!

217
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:57,741
What in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

218
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,302
Get up and over!

219
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:01,241
Move it, move it!

220
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:03,876
Are you quitting on me?

221
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,250
Well, are you?

222
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:10,887
Then quit, you slimy, fucking,
walrus-looking piece of shit!

223
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,786
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

224
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,491
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

225
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,926
Now! Move it!

226
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:24,493
I'm going to rip your balls off so you
can't contaminate the rest of the world!

227
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,405
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

228
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:31,676
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo!

229
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:35,471
Pick 'em up and set 'em down, Pyle!

230
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:37,808
Quickly! Move it up!

231
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:42,848
Were you born a fat, slimy scumbag,
you piece of shit, Private Pyle?

232
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,182
Or did you have to work on it?

233
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,617
Move it up!

234
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:49,057
Quickly! Hustle up!

235
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:53,699
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, Private Pyle!

236
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:59,869
Are you going to fucking die?
Are you going to die on me?

237
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:01,331
Do it now!

238
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,276
Move it up!

239
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,740
Hustle it up! Quickly!

240
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,378
Feel dizzy?

241
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:10,978
Faint?

242
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,719
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on!

243
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:23,019
Quickly, ladies! Assholes and elbows!
Move it out!

244
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:24,622
Get up!

245
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:51,014
Reveille! Reveille!

246
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:53,355
Drop your cocks and grab your socks!

247
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,222
Today is Sunday!
Divine worship is 0800.

248
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,961
Get your bunks made
and your uniforms on.

249
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,427
Police call in two minutes.

250
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,234
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

251
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,206
Finish your bunks, then you two turds
clean the head.

252
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:12,775
I want that head so sanitary...

253
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:16,712
...that the Virgin Mary could go
in there and take a dump!

254
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,111
Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?

255
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:21,813
Sir, no, sir!

256
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,926
Private Joker, I don't believe
I heard you correctly!

257
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,655
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!

258
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:34,425
You little maggot!
You make me want to vomit!

259
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:39,295
You communist heathen, sound off
that you love the Virgin Mary...

260
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,540
...or I'll stomp your guts out!

261
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,340
You love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

262
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:45,806
Negative, sir!

263
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:48,607
Are you trying to offend me?

264
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,109
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong!

265
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:57,086
And that you will beat him harder
if he reverses himself, sir!

266
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:59,016
Who's your squad leader?

267
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:02,025
The private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir!

268
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,788
Private Snowball reporting, sir!

269
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:10,697
You're fired! Private Joker is promoted
to squad leader!

270
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,437
Disappear, scumbag!

271
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,876
Reporting as ordered, sir!

272
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:22,514
From now on Private Joker is your new
squad leader and you bunk with him.

273
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,074
He'll teach you!

274
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,945
He'll teach you how to pee!

275
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:30,721
Private Joker is ignorant
but he's got guts, and guts is enough.

276
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:32,683
Now you ladies carry on.

277
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,101
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

278
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,040
Operating rod handle.

279
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:52,311
Operating rod guide.

280
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,178
And the left one over the right.

281
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:59,109
Right one over the left.

282
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,415
Left one over the right.

283
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,951
Right one over the left.

284
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:11,261
Just throw your other leg over.

285
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:23,767
Pull the next one over
and you're home free.

286
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:34,017
Just throw it over.

287
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:44,226
That'a boy. Just set it down.

288
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,799
Congratulations, Leonard.

289
00:20:56,676 --> 00:20:57,643
You did it.

290
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:01,544
Fold the blanket and sheet back together.

291
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:03,982
Make a four-inch fold.

292
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:06,917
Got it?

293
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:08,543
You do it.

294
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,052
Right shoulder, hut!

295
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:20,396
Port, hut!

296
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,796
Order, hut!

297
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,562
Square these weapons away.

298
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,502
The deadliest weapon in the world...

299
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,875
...is a Marine, and his rifle.

300
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:14,343
It is your killer instinct
that must be harnessed...

301
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:17,718
...if you expect to survive in combat.

302
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:20,351
Your rifle...

303
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,059
...is only a tool.

304
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,896
It is a hard heart that kills.

305
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:30,395
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

306
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:33,671
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

307
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:36,031
You will not kill.

308
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,473
You will become dead Marines.

309
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:41,908
And then you will be in a world of shit.

310
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,775
Because Marines are not allowed...

311
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,782
...to die without permission!

312
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,015
Do you maggots understand?

313
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,954
"I love working for Uncle Sam!

314
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:00,791
"Lets me know just who I am!

315
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:07,004
"One, two, three, four!
United States Marine Corps!

316
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,010
"One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!

317
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:18,640
"My Corps! Your Corps!

318
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,280
"Our Corps! Marine Corps!

319
00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:25,952
"I don't know, but I've been told...

320
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:30,821
"...Eskimo pussy is mighty cold!

321
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,361
"Mmm, good! Feels good!

322
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:40,196
"Is good! Real good!

323
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:43,175
"Tastes good! Mighty good!

324
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:46,211
"Good for you! Good for me! "

325
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:50,613
Trim 'em!

326
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:55,279
Toe-jam!

327
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:00,120
Pop that blister!

328
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:10,927
Jesus H. Christ!

329
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:17,543
-Why is your footlocker unlocked?
-Sir, I don't know, sir!

330
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:21,144
If there is one thing
in this world I hate...

331
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:24,914
...it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, right?

332
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:30,218
Without dickheads like you,
there'd be no thievery in the world!

333
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:31,221
Get down!

334
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:39,558
Now let's just see
if there's anything missing!

335
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:44,533
Holy Jesus!

336
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:46,969
What is that?

337
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,438
What the fuck is that?

338
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,037
What is that, Private Pyle?

339
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,973
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!

340
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:58,809
-Where did you get it?
-From the mess hall, sir!

341
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:01,480
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Pyle?

342
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,557
Are you allowed to eat
jelly doughnuts, Private?

343
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,823
-Why not, Private?
-Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!

344
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:12,964
Because you are a disgusting fatbody,
Private Pyle!

345
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:18,795
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker?

346
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,770
Because I was hungry, sir!

347
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:22,005
Because you were hungry?

348
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,046
Private Pyle...

349
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:33,375
...has dishonored himself
and dishonored the platoon!

350
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:37,651
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed!

351
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:41,392
I have failed because
you have not helped me!

352
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:44,857
You people...

353
00:25:45,064 --> 00:25:49,626
...have not given Private Pyle
the proper motivation!

354
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:55,298
From now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

355
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,807
...I will not punish him.

356
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:00,404
I will punish all of you!

357
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,039
And the way I see it, ladies...

358
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:05,979
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut!

359
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,077
Get on your faces!

360
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:11,885
Open your mouth!

361
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:14,516
They're paying for it, you eat it!

362
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:17,321
Ready, exercise!

363
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:20,257
"One, two, three, four!

364
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,832
"I love the Marine Corps! "

365
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:44,122
You really look like shit today.

366
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:57,126
Everybody hates me now.

367
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,738
Even you.

368
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:07,303
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

369
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:12,140
You just keep making mistakes,
getting everybody in trouble.

370
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:17,849
I can't do anything right.

371
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:22,385
I need help.

372
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,156
I'm trying to help you.

373
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,067
I'm really trying.

374
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,440
Tuck your shirt in.

375
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:34,624
Do it.

376
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:48,103
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

377
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:38,156
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

378
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:41,590
Semper fi, do or die!

379
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:43,956
Gung ho, gung ho!

380
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:45,560
What makes the grass grow?

381
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:47,393
Blood, blood, blood.

382
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:51,192
What do we do for a living, ladies?

383
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,162
Kill, kill, kill!

384
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:54,871
I can't hear you!

385
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:56,766
Kill, kill, kill!

386
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,737
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!

387
00:31:00,346 --> 00:31:01,836
Kill, kill, kill!

388
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:05,645
Do any of you know
who Charles Whitman was?

389
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:10,051
None of you dumbasses knows?

390
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:17,458
Sir, he shot all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!

391
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,230
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

392
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,267
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas...

393
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:27,538
...from distances of up to 400 yards.

394
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:30,902
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

395
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,607
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!

396
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:38,441
And do you know how far away he was?

397
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:42,342
Sir, it was far! From that
book suppository building, sir!

398
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:44,615
Knock it off!

399
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:47,058
250 feet!

400
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:51,185
He was 250 feet away and shooting
at a moving target.

401
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,531
He got off three rounds...

402
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:56,930
...with an ltalian bolt-action rifle
in six seconds...

403
00:31:57,703 --> 00:32:00,228
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot!

404
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,435
Do any of you know where...

405
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:04,836
...these individuals learned to shoot?

406
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:10,010
Sir, in the Marines, sir!

407
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:14,013
In the Marines! Outstanding!
Those individuals...

408
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,383
...showed what one motivated Marine
and his rifle can do!

409
00:32:18,257 --> 00:32:20,657
Before you ladies leave my island...

410
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,517
...you will all be able
to do the same thing!

411
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:27,364
"Happy birthday to you

412
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:37,702
"Happy birthday, dear Jesus"

413
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,314
Today...

414
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,514
...is Christmas!

415
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,352
There will be a magic show at 0930!

416
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:56,093
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

417
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,388
...about how the free world
will conquer Communism...

418
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,968
...with the aid of God and a few Marines!

419
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,740
God has a hard-on for Marines...

420
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:15,402
...because we kill everything we see!

421
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:18,306
He plays His games...

422
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:20,716
...we play ours!

423
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:26,157
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

424
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:29,319
...we keep heaven packed...

425
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,758
...with fresh souls!

426
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:36,565
God was here before the Marine Corps!

427
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:39,802
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

428
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:43,836
...but your ass belongs to the Corps!

429
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,237
Do you ladies understand?

430
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:49,446
I can't hear you!

431
00:33:57,456 --> 00:33:59,822
It's been swabbed and brushed.

432
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,253
Everything...

433
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:05,855
...is clean.

434
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:11,491
Beautiful.

435
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,899
So that it slides perfectly.

436
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:19,875
Nice.

437
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:23,880
Everything cleaned...

438
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:26,381
...oiled.

439
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:31,514
So that your action is beautiful.

440
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:37,592
Smooth, Charlene.

441
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:02,550
Leonard talks to his rifle.

442
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,933
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.

443
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:20,635
I think Leonard's a Section 8.

444
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:26,542
It don't surprise me.

445
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,181
I want to slip my tubesteak
into your sister.

446
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:45,758
What will you take in trade?

447
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:49,901
What do you got?

448
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,109
Outstanding!

449
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,279
We've finally found something you do well!

450
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:15,791
What is your 6th general order?

451
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:20,898
Sir, to receive, obey and pass on
to the sentry who relieves me...

452
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,466
...all orders....

453
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:25,561
Sir, the 6th general....

454
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:28,234
The private does not know, sir!

455
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,637
You slimy scumbag,
get down and give me 25!

456
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,545
How many counts in that movement?

457
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:41,911
Sir, four, sir!

458
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:43,884
Why look down in the chamber?

459
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:48,183
Sir, to be sure the inspecting officer
is not given a loaded weapon, sir!

460
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,620
What's your 5th general order?

461
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:53,731
Sir, to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir!

462
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:56,160
What's this weapon's name?

463
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:59,098
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir!

464
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:02,101
Private, you are definitely
born again hard.

465
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:05,832
I may even let you serve as a rifleman
in my beloved Corps.

466
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:13,274
"I don't want no teenage queen!

467
00:37:16,288 --> 00:37:18,813
"I just want my M-14!

468
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:24,452
"If I die in the combat zone

469
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,831
"Box me up and ship me home!

470
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:35,371
"Pin my medals upon my chest!

471
00:37:38,644 --> 00:37:41,010
"Tell my mom I've done my best! "

472
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:48,284
Graduation is only a few days away...

473
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:52,952
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

474
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:57,053
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

475
00:37:58,463 --> 00:38:02,900
The instructors are proud to see us
growing beyond their control.

476
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:06,602
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

477
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,967
The Marine Corps wants killers.

478
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:14,173
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

479
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,414
Men without fear.

480
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:20,311
Today...

481
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:23,678
...you people are no longer maggots.

482
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:28,046
Today, you are Marines.

483
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:31,455
You are part of a brotherhood.

484
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:36,119
From now on, until the day you die...

485
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,522
... wherever you are...

486
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,530
...every Marine is your brother.

487
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:46,201
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

488
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,538
Some of you will not come back.

489
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:52,272
But always remember this:

490
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:54,344
Marines die.

491
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:56,711
That's what we're here for!

492
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,118
But the Marine Corps lives forever.

493
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:04,616
And that means you live forever!

494
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,957
0300, Infantry.

495
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,661
0300, Infantry.

496
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:21,942
1800, Engineers.
You go out and find mines.

497
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,374
Cowboy!

498
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,173
0300, Infantry.

499
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:29,673
0300, Infantry.

500
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:30,983
Joker!

501
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:32,841
4212...

502
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,817
...Basic Military Journalism.

503
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:36,714
You must be shitting me!

504
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:38,852
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

505
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:41,119
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

506
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,763
Sir, I wrote for
my high-school newspaper, sir!

507
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:47,356
Christ, you're not a writer,
you're a killer!

508
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:48,830
A killer, yes, sir!

509
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:50,025
Gomer Pyle!

510
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:57,408
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

511
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,848
Our last night on the island.

512
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:08,385
I draw fire watch.

513
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:14,378
Hi, Joker.

514
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:38,739
Are those...

515
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,207
...live rounds?

516
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,988
7.62 millimeter.

517
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:54,653
Full metal jacket.

518
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,801
Leonard, if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

519
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:13,806
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

520
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,111
I am...

521
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:22,920
...in a world...

522
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:26,788
...of shit!

523
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:32,096
Left shoulder, hut!

524
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,832
Right shoulder, hut!

525
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:40,901
Lock and load.

526
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:46,737
Order, hut!

527
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:51,408
"This is my rifle!

528
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:54,343
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine."

529
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,021
Get back in your bunks!

530
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,987
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

531
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,924
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

532
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,337
Why is Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

533
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:15,398
Why is Pyle holding that weapon?

534
00:43:15,943 --> 00:43:19,003
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

535
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,447
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform you...

536
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,551
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir!

537
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:37,824
Now listen to me, Private Pyle...

538
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,627
...and listen good.

539
00:43:42,236 --> 00:43:43,635
I want that weapon...

540
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:46,137
...and I want it now!

541
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:51,006
Place that rifle on the deck
at your feet...

542
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:54,177
...and step back away from it.

543
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,753
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

544
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:10,254
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

545
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:37,216
Easy, Leonard.

546
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:42,959
Go easy, man.

547
00:46:11,051 --> 00:46:12,279
Hey, baby.

548
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:14,978
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

549
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:17,590
Not just this minute.

550
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:21,587
Well, baby, me so horny.

551
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:23,760
Me so horny.

552
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:26,394
Me love you long time.

553
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:28,961
You party?

554
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,602
Yeah, we might party.

555
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:33,470
-How much?
-$15.

556
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:35,772
$15 for both of us?

557
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,774
No. Each you $15.

558
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,509
Me love you long time.

559
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:42,111
Me so horny.

560
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,174
$15 too beaucoup.

561
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,212
$5 each.

562
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,753
Me suckee-suckee.

563
00:46:49,456 --> 00:46:51,117
Me love you too much.

564
00:46:53,494 --> 00:46:56,156
$5 is all my mom allows me to spend.

565
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,989
Okay! $10 each.

566
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,624
What do we get for $10?

567
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:04,694
Everything you want.

568
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:06,695
Everything?

569
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,676
Buddy, you feel like spending some
of your hard-earned money?

570
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,818
Half of these gook whores are officers
in the Viet Cong.

571
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,221
The other half have TB.

572
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:24,654
Be sure you only fuck
the ones who cough.

573
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:16,941
That sucker really had some moves on him.

574
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:24,142
You know what pisses me off
about these people?

575
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:29,246
We're helping them
and they shit all over us.

576
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,417
I just can't feature that.

577
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:34,416
Don't take it too hard.
It's just business.

578
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:39,825
I hate Da Nang.
I want to go out into the field.

579
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:45,136
I'm here three months and all I do is take
handshake shots at award ceremonies.

580
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:48,741
You'd get wasted the first day
and it would be my fault.

581
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:51,237
A high-school girl could do my job.

582
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,308
I want to get into the shit.

583
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,073
I want some trigger time.

584
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,518
If you get killed, your mom will find me
and beat the shit out of me.

585
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,986
That's a negative.

586
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:11,323
Let's keep it short and sweet.
Anybody got anything new?

587
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:17,264
Rumor has it that the Tet ceasefire
will be cancelled.

588
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:19,628
Rear echelon paranoia.

589
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:23,941
Intelligence says Charlie might try
something big during Tet.

590
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,644
They say the same thing every year.

591
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,743
There's a lot of talk about it.

592
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,713
Don't lose any sleep over it.

593
00:49:30,951 --> 00:49:34,682
The Tet holiday is like July Fourth,
Christmas and New Year in one.

594
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:38,656
Every zipperhead in the North and South,
will bang gongs...

595
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:40,791
...and bark at the moon.

596
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,330
Ann-Margret and entourage
are due next week.

597
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,558
I want someone to stick
with her for a few days.

598
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:50,259
Rafterman, you take it.

599
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:53,401
Get some good low-angle stuff.

600
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:57,373
Don't be obvious, but I want to see fur
and early morning dew.

601
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:03,705
"Diplomats in Dungarees. Marine
engineers rebuild Dong Phuc villages...."

602
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:07,282
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees.

603
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:10,454
If they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

604
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,421
I'll make a note of it, sir.

605
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:15,818
"N.V.A. Soldier Deserts
After Reading Pamphlets."

606
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,830
"An N.V.A. regular, who realized
his side would lose...

607
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:22,501
"...deserted after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

608
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:25,934
That's good, Dave.
But why say, "N.V.A. regular"?

609
00:50:26,473 --> 00:50:27,804
Is there an irregular?

610
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:29,840
How about N.V.A. soldier?

611
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,368
I'll fix it.

612
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:36,908
"The Lawrence Welk Show" will be on TV
in two weeks. Dave, do 100 words on it.

613
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:39,712
"Not While We're Eating."

614
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:44,515
"N.V.A. learned not to interrupt meals of
Marines on a search-and-destroy mission."

615
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:48,892
We have a new directive from M.A.F.
on search and destroy.

616
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:54,093
Substitute "sweep and clear"
in place of "search and destroy."

617
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:55,166
Got it?

618
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:57,027
Got it. Very catchy.

619
00:50:58,171 --> 00:51:00,036
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

620
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:06,076
The kill. The grunts
must have hit something.

621
00:51:06,947 --> 00:51:08,346
Didn't see them.

622
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:12,049
I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

623
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:16,153
Grunts who buy toothbrushes
and deodorant for gooks:

624
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:18,254
"Winning of Hearts And Minds."

625
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,919
And combat action resulting in a kill:
"Winning the War."

626
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,623
You must have seen blood trails,
drag marks?

627
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:28,091
It was raining, sir.

628
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:31,162
That's why God passed
the law of probability.

629
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:34,368
Rewrite it with a happy ending,
say, one kill.

630
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,002
A sapper or an officer. Which?

631
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:38,874
Whichever you say.

632
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:41,677
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

633
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:44,212
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

634
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:49,852
You'd like our guys to read
the paper and feel bad?

635
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:53,922
In case you didn't know,
this is not a popular war.

636
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:56,460
Our job is to report the news that the...

637
00:51:56,596 --> 00:51:58,996
..."why-are-we-here"
civilian newsmen ignore.

638
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,628
Maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

639
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:06,771
You could find more blood trails
and drag marks.

640
00:52:08,175 --> 00:52:11,736
I've had my ass in the grass.
Can't say I liked it much.

641
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:14,912
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

642
00:52:15,682 --> 00:52:18,446
My present duties keep me where I belong:

643
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,477
In the rear with the gear.

644
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:30,626
Tet. The Year of the Monkey.

645
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,791
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

646
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:39,095
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

647
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:51,578
I am fucking bored to death, man.

648
00:52:53,153 --> 00:52:54,051
I have to get back in the shit.

649
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,247
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

650
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:02,526
Joker's so tough, he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

651
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:06,356
...then ask for seconds.

652
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,565
Listen up, pilgrim.

653
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,370
A day without blood is like
a day without sunshine!

654
00:53:15,742 --> 00:53:19,269
Joker thinks the bad bush is
between old mama-san's legs.

655
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,814
He's never been in the shit.

656
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:24,482
Hard to talk about. Like on Hastings.

657
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:28,548
You weren't on Operation Hastings.
You weren't even in country.

658
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:33,055
Eat shit and die, you fucking
Spanish-American poge!

659
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,586
I was there! I was in the shit
with the grunts.

660
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,431
Don't listen to Payback's bullshit,
Rafterman.

661
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:43,831
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

662
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:46,538
You listen to Joker.

663
00:53:46,907 --> 00:53:48,238
He knows ti ti.

664
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:49,564
Very little.

665
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:53,471
He's never been in the shit
'cause he ain't got the stare.

666
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:55,905
The 1,000-yard stare.

667
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,975
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit too long.

668
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:03,350
It's like, it's like you've
really seen beyond.

669
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:05,715
I got it.

670
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:08,925
All field Marines got it.
And you'll have it, too.

671
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,561
I will?

672
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:16,062
How do you stop five blacks
from raping a white chick?

673
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:17,695
Fuck you.

674
00:54:17,938 --> 00:54:19,599
Throw them a basketball.

675
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:25,509
Incoming.

676
00:54:28,315 --> 00:54:29,577
They're outgoing!

677
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:34,079
-That ain't outgoing!
-That ain't outgoing!

678
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:35,744
Now what'd I just say?

679
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:17,525
I hope they're just fucking with us.

680
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:19,494
I ain't ready for this shit.

681
00:56:13,853 --> 00:56:14,911
Cease fire!

682
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,691
Cease fire!

683
00:56:38,678 --> 00:56:39,736
The enemy...

684
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,509
...has very deceitfully...

685
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,644
...taken advantage of the ceasefire...

686
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:49,181
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

687
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:52,885
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

688
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:55,995
But we seem to be the exception.

689
00:56:56,963 --> 00:57:00,990
Charlie has hit every military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

690
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:02,925
In Saigon...

691
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:07,530
...the United States Embassy has been
overrun by suicide squads.

692
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,806
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

693
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:17,474
We have reports that a division of N.V.A....

694
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:21,346
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

695
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:24,815
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

696
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:27,586
...the civilian press are
wetting their pants...

697
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:32,695
...and even Cronkite is going to say
the war is now unwinnable.

698
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:35,663
In other words...

699
00:57:36,336 --> 00:57:40,136
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we all have to take a bite.

700
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:48,410
Does this mean Ann-Margret's
not coming?

701
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:56,114
You go straight up to Phu Bai.

702
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,526
Captain January will need you.

703
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,355
And you take off that damn button.

704
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,991
You can't get killed
wearing a peace symbol.

705
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:14,568
Permission to go with Joker.

706
00:58:15,675 --> 00:58:16,664
Granted.

707
00:58:17,877 --> 00:58:20,175
Sir, permission not to take Rafterman.

708
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,174
You still here?

709
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:25,116
Vanish ricky-tick
and take Rafterman with you.

710
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:27,714
You're responsible for him.

711
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,279
Get some! Get some!

712
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:33,928
Get some, baby!

713
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,613
I've got you, mother!

714
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,018
Anyone who runs is a VC.

715
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:55,822
Anyone who stands still...

716
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,728
...is a well-disciplined VC.

717
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:05,364
You guys ought to do a story about me.

718
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:09,863
Why should we do a story about you?

719
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:12,434
'Cause I'm so fucking good!

720
01:00:13,008 --> 01:00:14,703
That ain't no shit neither.

721
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:19,145
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

722
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:21,746
And 50 water buffaloes, too.

723
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,375
Them are all certified.

724
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,255
Any women or children?

725
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,190
Sometimes.

726
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:34,521
How can you kill women and children?

727
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,061
Easy.

728
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,624
You just don't lead them so much.

729
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:42,898
Ain't war hell?

730
01:01:20,242 --> 01:01:22,210
We want to get in the shit.

731
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,036
Down the road. Two-five.

732
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:25,874
Outstanding! Thanks.

733
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,806
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

734
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,747
I got a bro named Cowboy.

735
01:01:59,915 --> 01:02:01,246
You people one-one?

736
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,147
No, sir. We're reporters
for "Stars and Stripes."

737
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,853
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

738
01:02:08,223 --> 01:02:10,623
He's just down the road
in the platoon area.

739
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,392
May we tag along, sir?

740
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:14,323
No problem. Welcome aboard.

741
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,626
I'm Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski.

742
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,231
They call me Mr. Touchdown.

743
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,771
I played ball for Notre Dame.

744
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:25,471
You here to make Cowboy famous?

745
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:28,206
Never happen, sir.

746
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:32,113
If you came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

747
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,610
We got Condition Red and we expect rain.

748
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,785
Outstanding. We taking care of business?

749
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,812
The N.V.A. are dug in deep.

750
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:45,356
Hotel Company is working this side
of the river, house by house.

751
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:50,226
Charles has his shit together,
but we're still getting some decent kills.

752
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:54,127
We heard the N.V.A. executed
a lot of gook civilians.

753
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,196
Affirmative.

754
01:02:56,672 --> 01:03:00,199
I saw bodies half a klick
this side of the canal.

755
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:02,132
Can you show me where?

756
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,866
The dead have been covered with lime.

757
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,840
The dead know only one thing:

758
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:38,973
It is better to be alive.

759
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:53,256
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

760
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:55,327
What outfit are you with?

761
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,396
We're from "Stars and Stripes."

762
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:01,802
I'm Sergeant Joker
and this photographer is Rafterman.

763
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,668
I'm Lt. Cleves. Hartford, Connecticut.

764
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,602
Have you got a body count, sir?

765
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:07,673
Twenty.

766
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,834
How did it happen, sir?

767
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:13,204
The N.V.A. came in
with a list of gook names:

768
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:18,212
Government officials, policemen,
ARVN officers, teachers.

769
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:23,653
They asked them, real polite, to report
the next day for political re-education.

770
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,452
Everybody who turned up got shot.

771
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,387
Some they buried alive.

772
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:37,801
What is that button on your body armor?

773
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,732
A peace symbol, sir.

774
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:42,433
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

775
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:44,742
What is written on your helmet?

776
01:04:44,913 --> 01:04:46,312
"Born to Kill," sir.

777
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:49,541
You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

778
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:50,649
Is that some kind of sick joke?

779
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:54,512
Well, what does it mean?

780
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,855
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know very much.

781
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,496
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will shit on you!

782
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:05,333
Answer my question
or you'll stand tall before the Man.

783
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:08,001
I was referring to the duality of man, sir.

784
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,372
The duality of man.
The Jungian thing, sir.

785
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:16,033
-Whose side are you on?
-Our side, sir.

786
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:17,976
-Don't you love your country?
-Yes, sir.

787
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,048
Then get with the program. Jump on
the team and come in for the big win.

788
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:27,555
I ask that my Marines obey my orders
as they would the word of God.

789
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:31,358
We are helping the Vietnamese,
because inside every gook...

790
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:33,322
...is an American trying to get out.

791
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,157
It's a hardball world, son.

792
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:39,459
We must keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

793
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:55,147
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

794
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,578
Around the back.

795
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,795
-First Platoon?
-Through there.

796
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:33,883
Hey, Lone Ranger.

797
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:39,692
Holy shit!

798
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:50,562
I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit!

799
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:54,270
What's happening?

800
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,544
Just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

801
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,942
Why go back?

802
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,782
Here or there, samey-same.

803
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,713
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

804
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:07,286
Better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

805
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:10,384
Hey, you hogs, listen up!

806
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:14,462
This is my bro, Joker, from the island.
And this is....

807
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,696
They're from "Stars and Stripes."
You'll be famous.

808
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:25,032
We're the Lusthog squad.
We're lifetakers and heartbreakers.

809
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:28,768
We shoot holes in them
and fill them with lead.

810
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,743
Are you a photographer?

811
01:07:38,453 --> 01:07:40,114
I'm a combat correspondent.

812
01:07:41,923 --> 01:07:43,754
You seen much combat?

813
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:49,188
I've seen a little on TV.

814
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:55,564
You're a real comedian.

815
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,636
Well, they call me the Joker.

816
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,708
Well, I've got a joke for you.

817
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,640
I'm going to tear you a new asshole.

818
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:12,213
Well, pilgrim...

819
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:17,321
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit!

820
01:08:23,832 --> 01:08:25,129
You talk the talk.

821
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:28,392
Do you walk the walk?

822
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,804
You might not believe it...

823
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:39,880
...but under fire, Animal Mother
is a truly fine human being.

824
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,243
He just needs grenades thrown
at him the rest of his life.

825
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:56,728
Jungle bunny. Thank God
for the sickle cell, huh?

826
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:58,959
Yeah, Mother.

827
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:02,064
Hey, photographer!

828
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,835
Want to take a good picture?

829
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,200
Take this.

830
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,111
This...is my bro.

831
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,297
This is his party.

832
01:09:34,302 --> 01:09:35,894
He's the guest of honor.

833
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:39,101
Today is his birthday.

834
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,372
Happy birthday, zipperhead!

835
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:46,176
I will never forget this day.

836
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,848
The day I came to Hue city
and fought one million N.V.A. gooks.

837
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,154
I really love the little Commie bastards.

838
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,958
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

839
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,822
These are great days we're living!

840
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,870
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

841
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,831
These people we wasted here today...

842
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,976
...are the finest people we will ever know.

843
01:10:18,313 --> 01:10:22,409
Once we rotate back to the world, we'll
miss not having anyone worth shooting.

844
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,839
Delta 6 Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

845
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:14,220
We are receiving incoming fire
from the ville.

846
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,355
The lieutenant is down.

847
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,090
We'll stop and check out
what's in front of us.

848
01:12:24,906 --> 01:12:26,931
Okay, Lusthog squad, listen up!

849
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,940
We'll move up these two roads.

850
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,104
I want the third team up this road.

851
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,714
First and second team behind me
up this other road.

852
01:12:37,218 --> 01:12:39,083
Let's go! Let's get it done!

853
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:10,152
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

854
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,459
Start the cameras.
This is "Vietnam: The Movie"!

855
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,920
If Joker is John Wayne, I'm a horse!

856
01:17:16,097 --> 01:17:18,759
-T.H.E. Rock can be a rock!
-I'll be Ann-Margret!

857
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:19,865
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

858
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:23,595
-I'll be General Custer!
-Who'll be the Indian?

859
01:17:23,771 --> 01:17:26,205
We'll let the gooks play the Indians!

860
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,336
You're going home now.

861
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:11,852
Semper fi.

862
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:17,281
We're mean Marines, sir.

863
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:22,856
Go easy, bros.

864
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,301
Better you than me.

865
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:35,834
At least they died for a good cause.

866
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,544
What cause was that?

867
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:41,847
Freedom.

868
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:45,309
Flush out your head gear, New Guy.

869
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,217
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

870
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,554
This is a slaughter.

871
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,831
If I get my balls blown off for a word...

872
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:01,763
...my word is "poontang."

873
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:07,334
Tough break for Hand Job.

874
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:11,734
He was set to get shipped out
on a medical.

875
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:15,807
What was wrong with him?

876
01:19:18,419 --> 01:19:20,546
He was jerking off ten times a day.

877
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,719
It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

878
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:32,629
Last week he was sent to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

879
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,171
The crazy fucker jerks off
in the waiting room.

880
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:40,331
Instant Section 8.

881
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,738
He was waiting for his papers
to clear division.

882
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:48,948
Ready?

883
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:50,282
Turnover.

884
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:54,546
Hue city interviews. Roll 34.

885
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:01,704
This is a major city,
so we have to assault with...

886
01:20:02,712 --> 01:20:04,509
...tanks in the streets.

887
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,811
They send us in first squad...

888
01:20:06,982 --> 01:20:09,746
...to make sure there are no little, uh...

889
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:15,089
...Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

890
01:20:15,257 --> 01:20:19,785
So we roll the tanks in and basically,
blow the place to hell.

891
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:23,629
When we're in Hue, in Hue city...

892
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,763
...it's like a war, you know.

893
01:20:29,138 --> 01:20:32,699
Like what I thought about, what l
thought a war was supposed to be.

894
01:20:36,045 --> 01:20:37,842
There's the enemy, kill them.

895
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:41,375
There's no question about it.
We're the best.

896
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:46,317
It's bullshit about Air Cav. When
the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

897
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:49,248
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine!

898
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:52,520
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

899
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:56,798
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam,
I'll tell you that.

900
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,465
Can I quote L.B.J.?

901
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:03,364
"I will not send...

902
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:07,706
"...American boys 10,000 miles
around the world...

903
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:11,038
"...to do a job Asian boys
should be doing for themselves."

904
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:15,439
Personally, I think...

905
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,776
...they don't want to be involved
in this war.

906
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:21,178
I think they sort of...

907
01:21:22,724 --> 01:21:26,956
...took away our freedom and gave it
to the gooks. They don't want it.

908
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:30,088
They'd rather be alive than free.

909
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:31,832
Poor dumb bastards.

910
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:36,402
The ones I'm fighting at are some pretty...

911
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:39,672
...pretty bad boys. I'm not real, uh....

912
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:41,933
I'm not real keen on...

913
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,739
...these fellows that are supposedly
on our side.

914
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:50,314
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

915
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:58,026
We get killed for these people
and they don't even appreciate it.

916
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:01,456
They think it's a big joke.

917
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:03,559
If you ask me...

918
01:22:04,766 --> 01:22:06,757
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

919
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:10,102
It depends. I'm here
to take combat photos.

920
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:13,906
But if the shit gets too thick,
I'll go to the rifle.

921
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:18,375
What do I think of America's involvement
in the war?

922
01:22:18,547 --> 01:22:20,037
I think we should win.

923
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:22,143
I hate Vietnam.

924
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:26,487
There's not one horse
in the whole country.

925
01:22:27,623 --> 01:22:29,989
There's something wrong with that.

926
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:32,591
If they'd send us more guys maybe...

927
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:36,923
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

928
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,798
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam...

929
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:42,334
...the jewel of Southeast Asia.

930
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:45,198
I wanted to meet...

931
01:22:45,374 --> 01:22:48,639
...interesting people of an ancient culture
and kill them.

932
01:22:50,913 --> 01:22:54,713
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

933
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:22,103
'Morning, little schoolgirl.

934
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:24,779
I'm a little schoolboy, too.

935
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:29,541
-What you got there?
-Do you want No. 1 fuckee?

936
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,588
Any of you boys want
No. 1 fuckee?

937
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:37,285
I'm so horny I can't even get
a piece of hand!

938
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,290
Me want suckee.

939
01:23:38,493 --> 01:23:43,226
Suckee, fuckee, she give you everything
you want. Long time.

940
01:23:43,699 --> 01:23:46,133
Everything you want! All right!

941
01:23:46,501 --> 01:23:47,559
How much, chief?

942
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:48,895
$15 each.

943
01:23:52,374 --> 01:23:54,239
$15 beaucoup money.

944
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:56,176
$5 each.

945
01:23:56,778 --> 01:23:58,473
Come on, she love you good.

946
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,807
Boom-boom long time. $10.

947
01:24:01,149 --> 01:24:01,945
$5.

948
01:24:02,217 --> 01:24:03,343
No, $10.

949
01:24:03,885 --> 01:24:05,716
Trade you some ARVN rifles.

950
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:08,418
Never been fired and only dropped once.

951
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,448
Okay, $5. You give me.

952
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:17,064
Let's get mounted.

953
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:23,761
Something wrong, chief?

954
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:25,939
She says no boom-boom with you.

955
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:27,640
What the motherfuck?

956
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:30,035
She says soul brother too beaucoup.

957
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:35,808
He's saying you black boys
pack too much meat!

958
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:46,290
She looks like she could suck
the chrome off a trailer hitch.

959
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,055
She say too beaucoup. Too beaucoup.

960
01:24:50,032 --> 01:24:51,294
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:56,025
What we have here is a magnificent...

962
01:24:56,271 --> 01:24:58,865
...specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

963
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:01,599
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

964
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:04,239
Okay. Okay.

965
01:25:11,286 --> 01:25:13,584
-We need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

966
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:16,986
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

967
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:20,523
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

968
01:25:24,066 --> 01:25:27,229
Hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

969
01:25:28,337 --> 01:25:30,737
-I don't want it after you, man!
-Fuck you!

970
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:06,102
Intelligence passed the word down...

971
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:09,833
...that during the night the N. V.A.
pulled out of our area...

972
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,411
...to positions across the Perfume River.

973
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:16,878
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

974
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:51,745
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!

975
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:17,071
He ain't going to make it.

976
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,617
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

977
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,392
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

978
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:40,691
Murph, this is Cowboy.

979
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:43,598
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

980
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:46,805
Wait one.

981
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:54,712
You're senior NCO. Take charge
and continue with the patrol.

982
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:57,278
Call in at the next checkpoint. Over.

983
01:27:57,819 --> 01:27:59,309
Roger. Understand.

984
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:08,260
I'm squad leader.

985
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,791
I'll follow you anywhere, scumbag.

986
01:28:17,572 --> 01:28:18,539
He's dead.

987
01:29:08,523 --> 01:29:09,490
What's up?

988
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:12,491
We made a mistake at the last checkpoint.

989
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:15,120
See what you think.

990
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:20,031
I think we're here...

991
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:22,634
...and we should be here.

992
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:27,265
We're here?

993
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:29,907
We should be here?

994
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:46,223
What do you think?

995
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:50,288
I think we should change direction.

996
01:30:07,215 --> 01:30:08,739
We'll change direction.

997
01:30:19,794 --> 01:30:20,726
What's up?

998
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:22,995
Change in direction.

999
01:30:24,332 --> 01:30:25,390
Are we lost?

1000
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,532
Joker, shut the fuck up!

1001
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:30,435
Okay, listen up!

1002
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:32,635
Can you hear me?

1003
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:35,269
We're changing direction.

1004
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:37,373
We're heading over that way.

1005
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:39,911
Eightball's going to find a way through.

1006
01:30:41,249 --> 01:30:42,181
Got it?

1007
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:45,217
Eightball, let's dance.

1008
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:47,853
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1009
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:09,764
Cease fire!

1010
01:32:10,138 --> 01:32:11,662
Cease fire, goddamn it!

1011
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:14,370
Cool it, goddamn it! Cease fire!

1012
01:32:17,946 --> 01:32:21,677
Listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1013
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:25,076
Negative!

1014
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,983
Save your ammo!
Nobody fire till I tell you!

1015
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:33,553
No! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1016
01:32:34,062 --> 01:32:35,495
Animal, cease fire!

1017
01:32:35,897 --> 01:32:37,455
It's Sergeant Murphy.

1018
01:32:38,299 --> 01:32:39,698
Cowboy. Over.

1019
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:42,927
Murphy. What is your present position?
Over.

1020
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:44,936
Receiving enemy sniper fire.

1021
01:32:45,073 --> 01:32:46,267
Eightball is down.

1022
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:50,172
We're half a klick north
of checkpoint No. 4.

1023
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:53,979
Possible strong enemy forces in front of us.

1024
01:32:54,415 --> 01:32:56,815
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1025
01:32:58,286 --> 01:32:59,810
Roger. Understand.

1026
01:33:00,021 --> 01:33:02,148
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1027
01:33:05,093 --> 01:33:06,082
Stay close.

1028
01:33:08,096 --> 01:33:11,759
Listen up! I think we're being
set up for an ambush.

1029
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,564
There may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings.

1030
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,968
I've requested tank support.

1031
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:19,470
We'll sit tight...

1032
01:33:19,941 --> 01:33:22,705
...but keep our eyes open.
If they hit us...

1033
01:33:22,977 --> 01:33:23,875
...we'll have to pull back fast.

1034
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:29,109
Goddamn it! Cease your fire, Mother!

1035
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:31,042
Cease your fucking fire!

1036
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:33,450
We can't leave him!

1037
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:36,180
We'll get him when the tank comes up.

1038
01:33:36,391 --> 01:33:38,689
He's hit three times! He can't wait!

1039
01:33:39,227 --> 01:33:43,721
That sniper's just trying
to suck us in one at a time.

1040
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:48,735
Goddamn it! No!

1041
01:33:50,004 --> 01:33:51,494
Goddamn it, cease fire!

1042
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:55,042
Fuck this shit!
I'm going in to bring him out!

1043
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:57,610
Sit the fuck down, goddamn it!

1044
01:34:14,529 --> 01:34:16,895
Okay, cease fire! He's there!

1045
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:34,246
Hold your fire!

1046
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:35,777
Hold your fire!

1047
01:34:36,784 --> 01:34:39,014
You can't see the sniper!

1048
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:42,887
Save the ammo! Nobody fire
till I tell you! Nobody!

1049
01:34:49,264 --> 01:34:50,492
Hold your fire!

1050
01:34:51,799 --> 01:34:53,460
What the fuck do we do now?

1051
01:34:55,536 --> 01:34:57,231
Give me that fucking radio.

1052
01:35:01,743 --> 01:35:03,574
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1053
01:35:06,247 --> 01:35:10,445
We're in deep shit. Two men down.
What's the story on the tank? Over.

1054
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:13,711
Sorry, Cowboy.

1055
01:35:13,922 --> 01:35:15,753
No luck so far with the tank.

1056
01:35:16,024 --> 01:35:17,616
Will advise. Over.

1057
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:23,488
Numb-nut bastards.

1058
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:25,627
Okay, listen up!

1059
01:35:28,403 --> 01:35:29,961
Can't wait for the tank.

1060
01:35:30,672 --> 01:35:32,503
They're going to hit us any minute.

1061
01:35:32,674 --> 01:35:34,665
When they do, we won't have time.

1062
01:35:35,076 --> 01:35:37,510
We have to pull out now. Get ready.

1063
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:40,409
Wait! Hold it!

1064
01:35:40,982 --> 01:35:42,449
Nobody's pulling out!

1065
01:35:42,817 --> 01:35:43,715
There's only one fucking sniper!

1066
01:35:44,886 --> 01:35:45,818
Back off!

1067
01:35:46,387 --> 01:35:49,049
I'm calling the plays and I say we pull out!

1068
01:35:49,357 --> 01:35:51,154
What about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1069
01:35:51,292 --> 01:35:54,921
It's shitty, but we can't refuse
to accept the situation.

1070
01:35:55,196 --> 01:35:57,596
We're not leaving them out there!

1071
01:35:57,832 --> 01:35:59,356
They're wasted!

1072
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,095
You know that!

1073
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:03,661
Come on, we gotta bring them back.

1074
01:36:04,005 --> 01:36:05,165
Let's do it!

1075
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:07,531
Stand down! That's a direct order.

1076
01:36:11,946 --> 01:36:14,744
Fuck you, Cowboy!
Fuck all you assholes!

1077
01:36:18,186 --> 01:36:19,175
Goddamn it!

1078
01:36:19,387 --> 01:36:20,911
Fucking son of a bitch!

1079
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:22,923
You motherfucker!

1080
01:36:44,345 --> 01:36:45,710
Where's the sniper?

1081
01:36:49,283 --> 01:36:51,547
Doc, where's the sniper?

1082
01:37:01,062 --> 01:37:01,892
Shit!

1083
01:37:04,432 --> 01:37:06,024
Shit! Fuck!

1084
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,052
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!

1085
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,952
There's only one sniper!

1086
01:38:07,662 --> 01:38:10,392
Move up the squad!
You're clear up to here!

1087
01:38:16,404 --> 01:38:17,803
Son of a bitch.

1088
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:29,811
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
come with me. We'll take a look.

1089
01:38:30,685 --> 01:38:32,846
You stay put and cover our ass!

1090
01:38:33,354 --> 01:38:34,252
We may come back in a big hurry!

1091
01:38:37,091 --> 01:38:39,218
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming, too.

1092
01:38:41,429 --> 01:38:42,293
All set?

1093
01:38:43,164 --> 01:38:44,028
Let's move!

1094
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:27,701
Top of the building, round the corner.

1095
01:39:47,662 --> 01:39:49,323
Give me that radio.

1096
01:39:53,034 --> 01:39:54,501
This is Cowboy. Over.

1097
01:40:05,846 --> 01:40:08,940
Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot
through the hole!

1098
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:24,659
That son of a bitch!

1099
01:40:24,865 --> 01:40:26,230
You'll be all right.

1100
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,630
Don't shit me, Joker!

1101
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:32,433
I'm not. You're my favorite turd.

1102
01:40:40,348 --> 01:40:41,872
Hang on, man! Hang on!

1103
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,414
I can hack it.

1104
01:40:55,296 --> 01:40:56,661
I can hack it.

1105
01:41:54,889 --> 01:41:56,481
Let's go get some payback.

1106
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:04,195
Okay.

1107
01:42:20,214 --> 01:42:21,806
Watch that fucking hole.

1108
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:24,984
Give them some smoke.

1109
01:42:41,402 --> 01:42:42,426
Ready?

1110
01:43:24,111 --> 01:43:26,705
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1111
01:43:32,953 --> 01:43:33,851
Joker, in there! New Guy!

1112
01:45:39,713 --> 01:45:42,011
We got the sniper!

1113
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:21,187
What's up?

1114
01:46:23,223 --> 01:46:24,622
We got the sniper.

1115
01:46:37,972 --> 01:46:39,371
I saved Joker's ass.

1116
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,302
I got the sniper.

1117
01:46:42,176 --> 01:46:44,201
I fucking blew her away!

1118
01:46:45,646 --> 01:46:47,238
Am I bad?

1119
01:46:48,148 --> 01:46:50,981
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1120
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:11,067
What's she saying?

1121
01:47:15,476 --> 01:47:16,636
She's praying.

1122
01:47:21,315 --> 01:47:23,408
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1123
01:47:27,554 --> 01:47:29,545
There's nothing we can do for her.

1124
01:47:31,659 --> 01:47:32,921
She's dead meat.

1125
01:47:40,701 --> 01:47:41,599
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1126
01:47:47,441 --> 01:47:48,635
What about her?

1127
01:47:53,113 --> 01:47:54,080
Fuck her.

1128
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:57,108
Let her rot.

1129
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:15,998
We can't just leave her here.

1130
01:48:19,606 --> 01:48:20,800
Hey, asshole...

1131
01:48:21,008 --> 01:48:22,373
...Cowboy's wasted.

1132
01:48:24,778 --> 01:48:26,507
You're fresh out of friends.

1133
01:48:28,449 --> 01:48:30,144
I'm running this squad now.

1134
01:48:30,417 --> 01:48:33,386
And I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1135
01:48:38,392 --> 01:48:40,360
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1136
01:48:43,564 --> 01:48:46,089
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.

1137
01:48:56,844 --> 01:48:59,039
Shoot...me.

1138
01:49:01,749 --> 01:49:02,841
Shoot...

1139
01:49:04,084 --> 01:49:05,016
...me.

1140
01:49:17,564 --> 01:49:19,794
If you want to waste her, go on...

1141
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:24,028
...waste her.

1142
01:49:48,729 --> 01:49:49,787
Shoot.

1143
01:50:41,648 --> 01:50:45,482
We'll have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of...Ugly!

1144
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:51,355
Hardcore, man.

1145
01:50:54,328 --> 01:50:55,852
Fucking hardcore.

1146
01:51:13,881 --> 01:51:17,874
We have nailed our names
in the pages ofhistory enough for today.

1147
01:51:19,519 --> 01:51:22,420
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1148
01:51:33,267 --> 01:51:36,703
"We play fair and we work hard
And we're in harmony

1149
01:51:37,704 --> 01:51:41,299
"M-l-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1150
01:51:46,446 --> 01:51:49,142
"Forever let us hold our banner high

1151
01:51:51,051 --> 01:51:52,848
"Boys and girls from far and near

1152
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:54,783
"You're welcome as can be

1153
01:51:55,455 --> 01:51:59,186
"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

1154
01:51:59,993 --> 01:52:02,018
"Who's the leader of the club...."

1155
01:52:02,629 --> 01:52:06,429
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1156
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:12,036
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming fuck fantasy.

1157
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,070
I am so happy that I am alive...

1158
01:52:16,743 --> 01:52:18,904
...in one piece, and short.

1159
01:52:20,914 --> 01:52:23,474
I'm in a world of shit, yes.

1160
01:52:24,418 --> 01:52:25,817
But I am alive.

1161
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,178
And I am not afraid.

1162
01:52:31,413 --> 01:52:32,573
Get some, baby!

1163
01:52:42,825 --> 01:52:44,258
I've got you, mother!

1164
01:52:49,865 --> 01:52:52,663
Anyone who runs is a VC.

1165
01:52:53,569 --> 01:52:54,467
Anyone who stands still...

1166
01:52:56,405 --> 01:52:58,373
...is a well-disciplined VC.

1167
01:53:01,176 --> 01:53:04,009
You guys ought to do a story about me.

1168
01:53:05,914 --> 01:53:08,508
Why should we do a story about you?

1169
01:53:09,384 --> 01:53:11,079
'Cause I'm so fucking good!

1170
01:53:11,653 --> 01:53:13,348
That ain't no shit neither.

1171
01:53:13,956 --> 01:53:17,790
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

1172
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,391
And 50 water buffaloes, too.

1173
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:23,020
Them are all certified.

1174
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,900
Any women or children?

1175
01:53:27,903 --> 01:53:28,835
Sometimes.

1176
01:53:30,572 --> 01:53:33,166
How can you kill women and children?

1177
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:35,706
Easy.

1178
01:53:36,278 --> 01:53:38,269
You just don't lead them so much.

1179
01:53:40,349 --> 01:53:41,543
Ain't war hell?

1180
01:54:18,887 --> 01:54:20,855
We want to get in the shit.

1181
01:54:21,123 --> 01:54:22,681
Down the road. Two-five.

1182
01:54:22,824 --> 01:54:24,519
Outstanding! Thanks.

1183
01:54:53,755 --> 01:54:56,451
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

1184
01:54:56,925 --> 01:54:58,392
I got a bro named Cowboy.

1185
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,891
You people one-one?

1186
01:55:00,062 --> 01:55:02,792
No, sir. We're reporters
for "Stars and Stripes."

1187
01:55:04,633 --> 01:55:06,498
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

1188
01:55:06,868 --> 01:55:09,268
He's just down the road
in the platoon area.

1189
01:55:09,638 --> 01:55:11,037
May we tag along, sir?

1190
01:55:11,239 --> 01:55:12,968
No problem. Welcome aboard.

1191
01:55:13,609 --> 01:55:16,271
I'm Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski.

1192
01:55:17,079 --> 01:55:18,876
They call me Mr. Touchdown.

1193
01:55:19,448 --> 01:55:21,416
I played ball for Notre Dame.

1194
01:55:23,218 --> 01:55:24,116
You here to make Cowboy famous?

1195
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:26,851
Never happen, sir.

1196
01:55:27,322 --> 01:55:30,758
If you came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

1197
01:55:31,627 --> 01:55:34,255
We got Condition Red and we expect rain.

1198
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:37,430
Outstanding. We taking care of business?

1199
01:55:37,933 --> 01:55:39,457
The N.V.A. are dug in deep.

1200
01:55:39,701 --> 01:55:44,001
Hotel Company is working this side
of the river, house by house.

1201
01:55:44,673 --> 01:55:48,871
Charles has his shit together,
but we're still getting some decent kills.

1202
01:55:49,177 --> 01:55:52,772
We heard the N.V.A. executed
a lot of gook civilians.

1203
01:55:53,715 --> 01:55:54,841
Affirmative.

1204
01:55:55,317 --> 01:55:58,844
I saw bodies half a klick
this side of the canal.

1205
01:55:59,287 --> 01:56:00,777
Can you show me where?

1206
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:30,511
The dead have been covered with lime.

1207
01:56:32,688 --> 01:56:34,485
The dead know only one thing:

1208
01:56:35,991 --> 01:56:37,618
It is better to be alive.

1209
01:56:49,137 --> 01:56:51,901
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

1210
01:56:52,607 --> 01:56:53,972
What outfit are you with?

1211
01:56:54,176 --> 01:56:56,041
We're from "Stars and Stripes."

1212
01:56:57,512 --> 01:57:00,447
I'm Sergeant Joker
and this photographer is Rafterman.

1213
01:57:01,049 --> 01:57:03,313
I'm Lt. Cleves. Hartford, Connecticut.

1214
01:57:03,552 --> 01:57:05,247
Have you got a body count, sir?

1215
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:06,318
Twenty.

1216
01:57:06,955 --> 01:57:08,479
How did it happen, sir?

1217
01:57:09,324 --> 01:57:11,849
The N.V.A. came in
with a list of gook names:

1218
01:57:13,228 --> 01:57:16,857
Government officials, policemen,
ARVN officers, teachers.

1219
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:22,298
They asked them, real polite, to report
the next day for political re-education.

1220
01:57:24,106 --> 01:57:26,097
Everybody who turned up got shot.

1221
01:57:26,508 --> 01:57:28,032
Some they buried alive.

1222
01:57:34,182 --> 01:57:36,446
What is that button on your body armor?

1223
01:57:37,285 --> 01:57:38,377
A peace symbol, sir.

1224
01:57:38,553 --> 01:57:41,078
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

1225
01:57:41,556 --> 01:57:43,387
What is written on your helmet?

1226
01:57:43,558 --> 01:57:44,957
"Born to Kill," sir.

1227
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:48,186
You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

1228
01:57:48,396 --> 01:57:49,294
Is that some kind of sick joke?

1229
01:57:51,633 --> 01:57:53,157
Well, what does it mean?

1230
01:57:53,702 --> 01:57:56,500
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know very much.

1231
01:57:56,705 --> 01:58:00,141
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will shit on you!

1232
01:58:01,009 --> 01:58:03,978
Answer my question
or you'll stand tall before the Man.

1233
01:58:04,746 --> 01:58:06,646
I was referring to the duality of man, sir.

1234
01:58:08,617 --> 01:58:11,017
The duality of man.
The Jungian thing, sir.

1235
01:58:12,687 --> 01:58:14,678
-Whose side are you on?
-Our side, sir.

1236
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:16,621
-Don't you love your country?
-Yes, sir.

1237
01:58:16,792 --> 01:58:19,693
Then get with the program. Jump on
the team and come in for the big win.

1238
01:58:22,264 --> 01:58:26,200
I ask that my Marines obey my orders
as they would the word of God.

1239
01:58:27,068 --> 01:58:30,003
We are helping the Vietnamese,
because inside every gook...

1240
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:31,967
...is an American trying to get out.

1241
01:58:32,107 --> 01:58:33,802
It's a hardball world, son.

1242
01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:38,104
We must keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

1243
01:58:51,426 --> 01:58:53,792
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

1244
01:58:53,995 --> 01:58:55,223
Around the back.

1245
01:59:04,506 --> 01:59:06,440
-First Platoon?
-Through there.

1246
01:59:31,266 --> 01:59:32,528
Hey, Lone Ranger.

1247
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:38,337
Holy shit!

1248
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:49,207
I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit!

1249
01:59:51,653 --> 01:59:52,915
What's happening?

1250
01:59:53,355 --> 01:59:57,189
Just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

1251
01:59:57,325 --> 01:59:58,587
Why go back?

1252
01:59:58,994 --> 02:00:00,427
Here or there, samey-same.

1253
02:00:00,595 --> 02:00:02,358
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

1254
02:00:02,564 --> 02:00:05,931
Better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

1255
02:00:07,402 --> 02:00:09,029
Hey, you hogs, listen up!

1256
02:00:10,138 --> 02:00:13,107
This is my bro, Joker, from the island.
And this is....

1257
02:00:15,577 --> 02:00:18,341
They're from "Stars and Stripes."
You'll be famous.

1258
02:00:20,048 --> 02:00:23,677
We're the Lusthog squad.
We're lifetakers and heartbreakers.

1259
02:00:24,819 --> 02:00:27,413
We shoot holes in them
and fill them with lead.

1260
02:00:32,761 --> 02:00:34,388
Are you a photographer?

1261
02:00:37,098 --> 02:00:38,759
I'm a combat correspondent.

1262
02:00:40,568 --> 02:00:42,399
You seen much combat?

1263
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,833
I've seen a little on TV.

1264
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,209
You're a real comedian.

1265
02:00:56,484 --> 02:00:58,281
Well, they call me the Joker.

1266
02:01:00,522 --> 02:01:02,353
Well, I've got a joke for you.

1267
02:01:03,124 --> 02:01:05,285
I'm going to tear you a new asshole.

1268
02:01:09,664 --> 02:01:10,858
Well, pilgrim...

1269
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:15,966
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit!

1270
02:01:22,477 --> 02:01:23,774
You talk the talk.

1271
02:01:25,513 --> 02:01:27,037
Do you walk the walk?

1272
02:01:32,754 --> 02:01:34,449
You might not believe it...

1273
02:01:34,589 --> 02:01:38,525
...but under fire, Animal Mother
is a truly fine human being.

1274
02:01:39,794 --> 02:01:42,888
He just needs grenades thrown
at him the rest of his life.

1275
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,373
Jungle bunny. Thank God
for the sickle cell, huh?

1276
02:01:56,478 --> 02:01:57,604
Yeah, Mother.

1277
02:01:59,447 --> 02:02:00,709
Hey, photographer!

1278
02:02:02,751 --> 02:02:04,480
Want to take a good picture?

1279
02:02:07,856 --> 02:02:08,845
Take this.

1280
02:02:18,266 --> 02:02:19,756
This...is my bro.

1281
02:02:30,645 --> 02:02:31,942
This is his party.

1282
02:02:32,947 --> 02:02:34,539
He's the guest of honor.

1283
02:02:36,017 --> 02:02:37,746
Today is his birthday.

1284
02:02:39,254 --> 02:02:41,017
Happy birthday, zipperhead!

1285
02:02:43,024 --> 02:02:44,821
I will never forget this day.

1286
02:02:45,727 --> 02:02:49,493
The day I came to Hue city
and fought one million N.V.A. gooks.

1287
02:02:51,433 --> 02:02:53,799
I really love the little Commie bastards.

1288
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:58,603
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1289
02:03:00,442 --> 02:03:02,467
These are great days we're living!

1290
02:03:04,546 --> 02:03:07,515
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1291
02:03:08,383 --> 02:03:10,476
These people we wasted here today...

1292
02:03:12,187 --> 02:03:14,621
...are the finest people we will ever know.

1293
02:03:16,958 --> 02:03:21,054
Once we rotate back to the world, we'll
miss not having anyone worth shooting.

1294
02:04:57,959 --> 02:05:00,484
Delta 6 Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1295
02:05:10,271 --> 02:05:12,865
We are receiving incoming fire
from the ville.

1296
02:05:13,408 --> 02:05:15,000
The lieutenant is down.

1297
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:17,735
We'll stop and check out
what's in front of us.

1298
02:05:23,551 --> 02:05:25,576
Okay, Lusthog squad, listen up!

1299
02:05:26,788 --> 02:05:28,585
We'll move up these two roads.

1300
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:30,749
I want the third team up this road.

1301
02:05:31,526 --> 02:05:34,359
First and second team behind me
up this other road.

1302
02:05:35,863 --> 02:05:37,728
Let's go! Let's get it done!

1303
02:10:06,033 --> 02:10:08,797
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1304
02:10:09,237 --> 02:10:12,104
Start the cameras.
This is "Vietnam: The Movie"!

1305
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:14,565
If Joker is John Wayne, I'm a horse!

1306
02:10:14,742 --> 02:10:17,404
-T.H.E. Rock can be a rock!
-I'll be Ann-Margret!

1307
02:10:17,612 --> 02:10:18,510
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

1308
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:22,240
-I'll be General Custer!
-Who'll be the Indian?

1309
02:10:22,416 --> 02:10:24,850
We'll let the gooks play the Indians!

1310
02:11:03,491 --> 02:11:04,981
You're going home now.

1311
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:10,497
Semper fi.

1312
02:11:14,368 --> 02:11:15,926
We're mean Marines, sir.

1313
02:11:20,341 --> 02:11:21,501
Go easy, bros.

1314
02:11:26,581 --> 02:11:27,946
Better you than me.

1315
02:11:32,386 --> 02:11:34,479
At least they died for a good cause.

1316
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:37,189
What cause was that?

1317
02:11:39,594 --> 02:11:40,492
Freedom.

1318
02:11:41,963 --> 02:11:43,954
Flush out your head gear, New Guy.

1319
02:11:46,701 --> 02:11:48,862
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1320
02:11:50,504 --> 02:11:52,199
This is a slaughter.

1321
02:11:54,008 --> 02:11:56,476
If I get my balls blown off for a word...

1322
02:11:58,679 --> 02:12:00,408
...my word is "poontang."

1323
02:12:04,318 --> 02:12:05,979
Tough break for Hand Job.

1324
02:12:07,888 --> 02:12:10,379
He was set to get shipped out
on a medical.

1325
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:14,452
What was wrong with him?

1326
02:12:17,064 --> 02:12:19,191
He was jerking off ten times a day.

1327
02:12:21,736 --> 02:12:24,364
It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

1328
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:31,274
Last week he was sent to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1329
02:12:32,847 --> 02:12:35,816
The crazy fucker jerks off
in the waiting room.

1330
02:12:37,418 --> 02:12:38,976
Instant Section 8.

1331
02:12:40,755 --> 02:12:43,383
He was waiting for his papers
to clear division.

1332
02:12:46,661 --> 02:12:47,593
Ready?

1333
02:12:47,995 --> 02:12:48,927
Turnover.

1334
02:12:51,098 --> 02:12:53,191
Hue city interviews. Roll 34.

1335
02:12:57,471 --> 02:13:00,668
This is a major city,
so we have to assault with...

1336
02:13:01,676 --> 02:13:03,473
...tanks in the streets.

1337
02:13:03,944 --> 02:13:05,775
They send us in first squad...

1338
02:13:05,946 --> 02:13:08,710
...to make sure there are no little, uh...

1339
02:13:10,818 --> 02:13:13,753
...Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1340
02:13:13,921 --> 02:13:18,449
So we roll the tanks in and basically,
blow the place to hell.

1341
02:13:19,927 --> 02:13:22,293
When we're in Hue, in Hue city...

1342
02:13:23,664 --> 02:13:25,427
...it's like a war, you know.

1343
02:13:27,802 --> 02:13:31,363
Like what I thought about, what l
thought a war was supposed to be.

1344
02:13:34,709 --> 02:13:36,506
There's the enemy, kill them.

1345
02:13:37,445 --> 02:13:40,039
There's no question about it.
We're the best.

1346
02:13:40,715 --> 02:13:44,981
It's bullshit about Air Cav. When
the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

1347
02:13:45,352 --> 02:13:47,912
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine!

1348
02:13:48,989 --> 02:13:51,184
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1349
02:13:52,493 --> 02:13:55,462
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam,
I'll tell you that.

1350
02:13:56,764 --> 02:13:58,129
Can I quote L.B.J.?

1351
02:14:00,401 --> 02:14:02,028
"I will not send...

1352
02:14:02,536 --> 02:14:06,370
"...American boys 10,000 miles
around the world...

1353
02:14:06,574 --> 02:14:09,702
"...to do a job Asian boys
should be doing for themselves."

1354
02:14:12,613 --> 02:14:14,103
Personally, I think...

1355
02:14:14,915 --> 02:14:17,440
...they don't want to be involved
in this war.

1356
02:14:18,352 --> 02:14:19,842
I think they sort of...

1357
02:14:21,388 --> 02:14:25,620
...took away our freedom and gave it
to the gooks. They don't want it.

1358
02:14:26,761 --> 02:14:28,752
They'd rather be alive than free.

1359
02:14:29,063 --> 02:14:30,496
Poor dumb bastards.

1360
02:14:32,233 --> 02:14:35,066
The ones I'm fighting at are some pretty...

1361
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:38,336
...pretty bad boys. I'm not real, uh....

1362
02:14:39,073 --> 02:14:40,597
I'm not real keen on...

1363
02:14:42,343 --> 02:14:45,403
...these fellows that are supposedly
on our side.

1364
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:48,978
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1365
02:14:53,254 --> 02:14:56,690
We get killed for these people
and they don't even appreciate it.

1366
02:14:58,425 --> 02:15:00,120
They think it's a big joke.

1367
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:02,223
If you ask me...

1368
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:05,421
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1369
02:15:05,933 --> 02:15:08,766
It depends. I'm here
to take combat photos.

1370
02:15:09,703 --> 02:15:12,570
But if the shit gets too thick,
I'll go to the rifle.

1371
02:15:14,241 --> 02:15:17,039
What do I think of America's involvement
in the war?

1372
02:15:17,211 --> 02:15:18,701
I think we should win.

1373
02:15:19,613 --> 02:15:20,807
I hate Vietnam.

1374
02:15:21,715 --> 02:15:25,151
There's not one horse
in the whole country.

1375
02:15:26,287 --> 02:15:28,653
There's something wrong with that.

1376
02:15:30,357 --> 02:15:31,255
If they'd send us more guys maybe...

1377
02:15:32,459 --> 02:15:35,587
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1378
02:15:37,164 --> 02:15:39,462
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam...

1379
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:40,998
...the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1380
02:15:42,736 --> 02:15:43,862
I wanted to meet...

1381
02:15:44,038 --> 02:15:47,303
...interesting people of an ancient culture
and kill them.

1382
02:15:49,577 --> 02:15:53,377
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1383
02:16:18,606 --> 02:16:20,767
'Morning, little schoolgirl.

1384
02:16:21,475 --> 02:16:23,443
I'm a little schoolboy, too.

1385
02:16:25,179 --> 02:16:28,205
-What you got there?
-Do you want No. 1 fuckee?

1386
02:16:30,784 --> 02:16:33,252
Any of you boys want
No. 1 fuckee?

1387
02:16:33,754 --> 02:16:35,949
I'm so horny I can't even get
a piece of hand!

1388
02:16:36,056 --> 02:16:36,954
Me want suckee.

1389
02:16:37,157 --> 02:16:41,890
Suckee, fuckee, she give you everything
you want. Long time.

1390
02:16:42,363 --> 02:16:44,797
Everything you want! All right!

1391
02:16:45,165 --> 02:16:46,223
How much, chief?

1392
02:16:46,433 --> 02:16:47,559
$15 each.

1393
02:16:51,038 --> 02:16:52,903
$15 beaucoup money.

1394
02:16:53,908 --> 02:16:54,840
$5 each.

1395
02:16:55,442 --> 02:16:57,137
Come on, she love you good.

1396
02:16:57,344 --> 02:16:59,471
Boom-boom long time. $10.

1397
02:16:59,813 --> 02:17:00,609
$5.

1398
02:17:00,881 --> 02:17:02,007
No, $10.

1399
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:04,380
Trade you some ARVN rifles.

1400
02:17:04,818 --> 02:17:07,082
Never been fired and only dropped once.

1401
02:17:08,622 --> 02:17:10,112
Okay, $5. You give me.

1402
02:17:14,261 --> 02:17:15,728
Let's get mounted.

1403
02:17:20,935 --> 02:17:22,425
Something wrong, chief?

1404
02:17:22,703 --> 02:17:24,603
She says no boom-boom with you.

1405
02:17:24,905 --> 02:17:26,304
What the motherfuck?

1406
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:28,699
She says soul brother too beaucoup.

1407
02:17:30,911 --> 02:17:34,472
He's saying you black boys
pack too much meat!

1408
02:17:41,689 --> 02:17:44,954
She looks like she could suck
the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1409
02:17:45,626 --> 02:17:47,719
She say too beaucoup. Too beaucoup.

1410
02:17:48,696 --> 02:17:49,958
Excuse me, ma'am.

1411
02:17:51,231 --> 02:17:54,689
What we have here is a magnificent...

1412
02:17:54,935 --> 02:17:57,529
...specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1413
02:17:58,238 --> 02:18:00,263
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1414
02:18:01,675 --> 02:18:02,903
Okay. Okay.

1415
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:12,248
-We need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

1416
02:18:12,453 --> 02:18:15,650
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1417
02:18:15,956 --> 02:18:19,187
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1418
02:18:22,730 --> 02:18:25,893
Hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1419
02:18:27,001 --> 02:18:29,401
-I don't want it after you, man!
-Fuck you!

1420
02:19:02,536 --> 02:19:04,766
Intelligence passed the word down...

1421
02:19:05,039 --> 02:19:08,497
...that during the night the N. V.A.
pulled out of our area...

1422
02:19:08,709 --> 02:19:11,075
...to positions across the Perfume River.

1423
02:19:11,879 --> 02:19:15,542
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1424
02:19:47,781 --> 02:19:50,409
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!

1425
02:20:14,108 --> 02:20:15,735
He ain't going to make it.

1426
02:20:27,154 --> 02:20:29,281
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1427
02:20:31,792 --> 02:20:34,056
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1428
02:20:37,865 --> 02:20:39,355
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1429
02:20:40,067 --> 02:20:42,262
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1430
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:45,469
Wait one.

1431
02:20:48,609 --> 02:20:53,376
You're senior NCO. Take charge
and continue with the patrol.

1432
02:20:53,747 --> 02:20:55,942
Call in at the next checkpoint. Over.

1433
02:20:56,483 --> 02:20:57,973
Roger. Understand.

1434
02:21:05,559 --> 02:21:06,924
I'm squad leader.

1435
02:21:10,464 --> 02:21:12,455
I'll follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1436
02:21:16,236 --> 02:21:17,203
He's dead.

1437
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:08,154
What's up?

1438
02:22:08,789 --> 02:22:11,155
We made a mistake at the last checkpoint.

1439
02:22:12,226 --> 02:22:13,784
See what you think.

1440
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:18,695
I think we're here...

1441
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:21,298
...and we should be here.

1442
02:22:24,905 --> 02:22:25,929
We're here?

1443
02:22:27,274 --> 02:22:28,571
We should be here?

1444
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:44,887
What do you think?

1445
02:22:46,893 --> 02:22:48,952
I think we should change direction.

1446
02:23:05,879 --> 02:23:07,403
We'll change direction.

1447
02:23:18,458 --> 02:23:19,390
What's up?

1448
02:23:20,294 --> 02:23:21,659
Change in direction.

1449
02:23:22,996 --> 02:23:24,054
Are we lost?

1450
02:23:24,331 --> 02:23:26,196
Joker, shut the fuck up!

1451
02:23:27,734 --> 02:23:29,099
Okay, listen up!

1452
02:23:30,037 --> 02:23:31,299
Can you hear me?

1453
02:23:32,306 --> 02:23:33,933
We're changing direction.

1454
02:23:34,308 --> 02:23:36,037
We're heading over that way.

1455
02:23:36,243 --> 02:23:38,575
Eightball's going to find a way through.

1456
02:23:39,913 --> 02:23:40,845
Got it?

1457
02:23:42,983 --> 02:23:43,881
Eightball, let's dance.

1458
02:23:45,619 --> 02:23:46,517
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1459
02:25:07,234 --> 02:25:08,428
Cease fire!

1460
02:25:08,802 --> 02:25:10,326
Cease fire, goddamn it!

1461
02:25:10,804 --> 02:25:13,034
Cool it, goddamn it! Cease fire!

1462
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:20,341
Listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1463
02:25:22,682 --> 02:25:23,740
Negative!

1464
02:25:23,917 --> 02:25:26,647
Save your ammo!
Nobody fire till I tell you!

1465
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:32,217
No! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1466
02:25:32,726 --> 02:25:34,159
Animal, cease fire!

1467
02:25:34,561 --> 02:25:36,119
It's Sergeant Murphy.

1468
02:25:36,963 --> 02:25:38,362
Cowboy. Over.

1469
02:25:38,565 --> 02:25:41,591
Murphy. What is your present position?
Over.

1470
02:25:42,235 --> 02:25:43,600
Receiving enemy sniper fire.

1471
02:25:43,737 --> 02:25:44,931
Eightball is down.

1472
02:25:46,106 --> 02:25:48,836
We're half a klick north
of checkpoint No. 4.

1473
02:25:49,242 --> 02:25:52,643
Possible strong enemy forces in front of us.

1474
02:25:53,079 --> 02:25:55,479
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1475
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:58,474
Roger. Understand.

1476
02:25:58,685 --> 02:26:00,812
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1477
02:26:03,757 --> 02:26:04,746
Stay close.

1478
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:10,423
Listen up! I think we're being
set up for an ambush.

1479
02:26:10,997 --> 02:26:14,228
There may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings.

1480
02:26:14,734 --> 02:26:15,632
I've requested tank support.

1481
02:26:16,803 --> 02:26:18,134
We'll sit tight...

1482
02:26:18,605 --> 02:26:21,369
...but keep our eyes open.
If they hit us...

1483
02:26:21,641 --> 02:26:22,539
...we'll have to pull back fast.

1484
02:26:25,145 --> 02:26:27,773
Goddamn it! Cease your fire, Mother!

1485
02:26:28,148 --> 02:26:29,706
Cease your fucking fire!

1486
02:26:30,817 --> 02:26:32,114
We can't leave him!

1487
02:26:32,319 --> 02:26:34,844
We'll get him when the tank comes up.

1488
02:26:35,055 --> 02:26:37,353
He's hit three times! He can't wait!

1489
02:26:37,891 --> 02:26:42,385
That sniper's just trying
to suck us in one at a time.

1490
02:26:45,499 --> 02:26:47,399
Goddamn it! No!

1491
02:26:48,668 --> 02:26:50,158
Goddamn it, cease fire!

1492
02:26:51,738 --> 02:26:53,706
Fuck this shit!
I'm going in to bring him out!

1493
02:26:53,874 --> 02:26:56,274
Sit the fuck down, goddamn it!

1494
02:27:13,193 --> 02:27:15,559
Okay, cease fire! He's there!

1495
02:27:31,545 --> 02:27:32,910
Hold your fire!

1496
02:27:33,213 --> 02:27:34,441
Hold your fire!

1497
02:27:35,448 --> 02:27:37,678
You can't see the sniper!

1498
02:27:38,218 --> 02:27:41,551
Save the ammo! Nobody fire
till I tell you! Nobody!

1499
02:27:47,928 --> 02:27:49,156
Hold your fire!

1500
02:27:50,463 --> 02:27:52,124
What the fuck do we do now?

1501
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:55,895
Give me that fucking radio.

1502
02:28:00,407 --> 02:28:02,238
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1503
02:28:04,911 --> 02:28:09,109
We're in deep shit. Two men down.
What's the story on the tank? Over.

1504
02:28:11,351 --> 02:28:12,375
Sorry, Cowboy.

1505
02:28:12,586 --> 02:28:14,417
No luck so far with the tank.

1506
02:28:14,688 --> 02:28:16,280
Will advise. Over.

1507
02:28:20,594 --> 02:28:22,152
Numb-nut bastards.

1508
02:28:23,063 --> 02:28:24,291
Okay, listen up!

1509
02:28:27,067 --> 02:28:28,625
Can't wait for the tank.

1510
02:28:29,336 --> 02:28:31,167
They're going to hit us any minute.

1511
02:28:31,338 --> 02:28:33,329
When they do, we won't have time.

1512
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:36,174
We have to pull out now. Get ready.

1513
02:28:37,811 --> 02:28:39,073
Wait! Hold it!

1514
02:28:39,646 --> 02:28:41,113
Nobody's pulling out!

1515
02:28:41,481 --> 02:28:42,379
There's only one fucking sniper!

1516
02:28:43,550 --> 02:28:44,482
Back off!

1517
02:28:45,051 --> 02:28:47,713
I'm calling the plays and I say we pull out!

1518
02:28:48,021 --> 02:28:49,818
What about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1519
02:28:49,956 --> 02:28:53,585
It's shitty, but we can't refuse
to accept the situation.

1520
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:56,260
We're not leaving them out there!

1521
02:28:56,496 --> 02:28:58,020
They're wasted!

1522
02:28:58,565 --> 02:28:59,759
You know that!

1523
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:02,325
Come on, we gotta bring them back.

1524
02:29:02,669 --> 02:29:03,829
Let's do it!

1525
02:29:04,170 --> 02:29:06,195
Stand down! That's a direct order.

1526
02:29:10,610 --> 02:29:13,408
Fuck you, Cowboy!
Fuck all you assholes!

1527
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:17,839
Goddamn it!

1528
02:29:18,051 --> 02:29:19,575
Fucking son of a bitch!

1529
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:21,587
You motherfucker!

1530
02:29:43,009 --> 02:29:44,374
Where's the sniper?

1531
02:29:47,947 --> 02:29:50,211
Doc, where's the sniper?

1532
02:29:59,726 --> 02:30:00,556
Shit!

1533
02:30:03,096 --> 02:30:04,688
Shit! Fuck!

1534
02:30:58,384 --> 02:31:00,716
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!

1535
02:31:02,455 --> 02:31:04,616
There's only one sniper!

1536
02:31:06,326 --> 02:31:09,056
Move up the squad!
You're clear up to here!

1537
02:31:15,068 --> 02:31:16,467
Son of a bitch.

1538
02:31:24,744 --> 02:31:28,475
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
come with me. We'll take a look.

1539
02:31:29,349 --> 02:31:31,510
You stay put and cover our ass!

1540
02:31:32,018 --> 02:31:32,916
We may come back in a big hurry!

1541
02:31:35,755 --> 02:31:37,882
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming, too.

1542
02:31:40,093 --> 02:31:40,957
All set?

1543
02:31:41,828 --> 02:31:42,692
Let's move!

1544
02:32:24,170 --> 02:32:26,365
Top of the building, round the corner.

1545
02:32:46,326 --> 02:32:47,987
Give me that radio.

1546
02:32:51,698 --> 02:32:53,165
This is Cowboy. Over.

1547
02:33:04,510 --> 02:33:07,604
Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot
through the hole!

1548
02:33:22,095 --> 02:33:23,323
That son of a bitch!

1549
02:33:23,529 --> 02:33:24,894
You'll be all right.

1550
02:33:25,064 --> 02:33:27,294
Don't shit me, Joker!

1551
02:33:28,902 --> 02:33:31,097
I'm not. You're my favorite turd.

1552
02:33:39,012 --> 02:33:40,536
Hang on, man! Hang on!

1553
02:33:44,884 --> 02:33:46,078
I can hack it.

1554
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:55,325
I can hack it.

1555
02:34:53,553 --> 02:34:55,145
Let's go get some payback.

1556
02:35:01,995 --> 02:35:02,859
Okay.

1557
02:35:18,878 --> 02:35:20,470
Watch that fucking hole.

1558
02:35:22,215 --> 02:35:23,648
Give them some smoke.

1559
02:35:40,066 --> 02:35:41,090
Ready?

1560
02:36:22,775 --> 02:36:25,369
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1561
02:36:31,617 --> 02:36:32,515
Joker, in there! New Guy!

1562
02:38:38,377 --> 02:38:40,675
We got the sniper!

1563
02:39:18,884 --> 02:39:19,851
What's up?

1564
02:39:21,887 --> 02:39:23,286
We got the sniper.

1565
02:39:36,636 --> 02:39:38,035
I saved Joker's ass.

1566
02:39:38,704 --> 02:39:39,966
I got the sniper.

1567
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:42,865
I fucking blew her away!

1568
02:39:44,310 --> 02:39:45,902
Am I bad?

1569
02:39:46,812 --> 02:39:49,645
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1570
02:40:08,434 --> 02:40:09,731
What's she saying?

1571
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:15,300
She's praying.

1572
02:40:19,979 --> 02:40:22,072
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1573
02:40:26,218 --> 02:40:28,209
There's nothing we can do for her.

1574
02:40:30,323 --> 02:40:31,585
She's dead meat.

1575
02:40:39,365 --> 02:40:40,263
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1576
02:40:46,105 --> 02:40:47,299
What about her?

1577
02:40:51,777 --> 02:40:52,744
Fuck her.

1578
02:40:54,714 --> 02:40:55,772
Let her rot.

1579
02:41:12,865 --> 02:41:14,662
We can't just leave her here.

1580
02:41:18,270 --> 02:41:19,464
Hey, asshole...

1581
02:41:19,672 --> 02:41:21,037
...Cowboy's wasted.

1582
02:41:23,442 --> 02:41:25,171
You're fresh out of friends.

1583
02:41:27,113 --> 02:41:28,808
I'm running this squad now.

1584
02:41:29,081 --> 02:41:32,050
And I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1585
02:41:37,056 --> 02:41:39,024
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1586
02:41:42,228 --> 02:41:44,753
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.

1587
02:41:55,508 --> 02:41:57,703
Shoot...me.

1588
02:42:00,413 --> 02:42:01,505
Shoot...

1589
02:42:02,748 --> 02:42:03,680
...me.

1590
02:42:16,228 --> 02:42:18,458
If you want to waste her, go on...

1591
02:42:21,634 --> 02:42:22,692
...waste her.

1592
02:42:47,393 --> 02:42:48,451
Shoot.

1593
02:43:40,312 --> 02:43:44,146
We'll have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of...Ugly!

1594
02:43:48,654 --> 02:43:50,019
Hardcore, man.

1595
02:43:52,992 --> 02:43:54,516
Fucking hardcore.

1596
02:44:12,545 --> 02:44:16,538
We have nailed our names
in the pages ofhistory enough for today.

1597
02:44:18,183 --> 02:44:21,084
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1598
02:44:31,931 --> 02:44:35,367
"We play fair and we work hard
