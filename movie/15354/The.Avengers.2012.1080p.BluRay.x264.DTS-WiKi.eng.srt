1
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,367
The Tesseract has awakened.

2
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:38,039
It is on a little world, a human world.

3
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:42,127
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:48,133
but our ally knows its workings as they never will.

5
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,762
He is ready to lead

6
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:58,393
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

7
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,439
A world will be his.

8
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,734
The universe, yours.

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,531
And the humans, what can they do but burn?

10
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,172
All personnel,

11
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,591
the evacuation order has been confirmed.

12
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:02,999
How bad is it?

13
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,294
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

14
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,967
Dr.Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.

15
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,969
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

16
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,388
He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.

17
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,556
Spontaneous event.

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,641
It just turned itself on?

19
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,142
Where are the energy levels now?

20
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,520
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.

21
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,729
How long to get everyone out?

22
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,481
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

23
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:27,941
Do better.

24
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,860
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

25
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,278
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

26
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,864
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

27
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,408
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

28
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,576
I need you to make sure

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,370
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

30
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,580
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

31
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,499
Until such time as the world ends,

32
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,459
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

33
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,003
Clear out the tech below.

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,256
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

35
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,841
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,425
With me.

37
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,429
Talk to me, Doctor.

38
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,850
Director.

39
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,726
Is there anything we know for certain?

40
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,145
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

41
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:09,148
- Is that supposed to be funny?  - No, it's not funny at all.

42
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,652
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

43
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,112
I assume you pulled the plug.

44
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,989
She's an energy source.

45
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,367
We turn off the power, she turns it back on.

46
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,577
If she reaches peak level...

47
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:24,205
We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space.

48
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,790
But we don't have the harness.

49
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:26,958
My calculations are far from complete.

50
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,295
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

51
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,921
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.

52
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,674
That can be harmful.

53
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,593
Where's Agent Barton?

54
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,469
The Hawk?

55
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,972
Up in his nest, as usual.

56
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,642
Agent Barton, report.

57
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,686
I gave you this detail

58
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,354
so you could keep a close eye on things.

59
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,981
Well, I see better from a distance.

60
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,858
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

61
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,736
Doctor, it's spiking again.

62
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,321
No one's come or gone.

63
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,156
And Selvig's clean.

64
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:00,491
No contacts, no IMs.

65
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,702
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.

66
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,205
"At this end"?

67
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,293
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

68
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:13,296
Doors open from both sides.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,506
Not yet.

70
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,452
Sir, please put down the spear.

71
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,826
You have heart.

72
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,150
Please don't.

73
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,903
I still need that.

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,821
This doesn't have to get any messier.

75
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,073
Of course it does.

76
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,033
I've come too far for anything else.

77
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,829
I am Loki, of Asgard.

78
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:55,166
and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

79
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,834
Loki,

80
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,628
brother of Thor.

81
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,963
We have no quarrel with your people.

82
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,133
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

83
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,511
Are you planning to step on us?

84
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,098
I come with glad tidings

85
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,017
of a world made free.

86
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,602
Free from what?

87
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,937
Freedom.

88
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,065
Freedom is life's great lie.

89
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:22,777
Once you accept that, in your heart,

90
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,075
you will know peace.

91
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah, you say "peace",

92
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,205
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

93
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,874
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

94
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,459
This place is about to blow

95
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:39,961
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

96
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,713
He means to bury us.

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,048
Like the pharaohs of old.

98
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:46,300
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

99
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,553
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

100
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:49,887
Well, then.

101
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,737
I need these vehicles.

102
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,910
- Who's that?  - They didn't tell me.

103
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,498
Hill!

104
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,624
Do you copy?

105
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,127
Barton has turned.

106
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,934
They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!

107
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,681
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

108
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,200
We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go.

109
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,668
Director?

110
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,420
Director Fury, do you copy?

111
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,089
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

112
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,425
I have men down. Hill?

113
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,011
A lot of men still under.

114
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,929
I don't know how many survivors.

115
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,306
Sound a general call.

116
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,016
I want every living soul not working rescue

117
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,100
looking for that briefcase.

118
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,268
Roger that.

119
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,813
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

120
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,691
As of right now,

121
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,151
we are at war.

122
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,446
What do we do?

123
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,778
This is not how I wanted this evening to go.

124
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,655
I know how you wanted this evening to go.

125
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,864
Believe me

126
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:19,990
this is better.

127
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,868
Who are you working for?

128
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,829
Lermentov, yes?

129
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,457
Does he think

130
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,334
we have to go through him

131
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,336
to move our cargo?

132
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:38,384
I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.

133
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,761
Solohob

134
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,013
a bagman, a front.

135
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:49,645
Your outdated information betrays you.

136
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,816
The famous Black Widow

137
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:59,822
and she turns out to be simply another pretty face.

138
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,868
You really think I'm pretty?

139
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,831
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

140
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,710
to move the tanks.

141
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,297
Tell him he is out.

142
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,340
Well...

143
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:22,803
...you may have to write it down.

144
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,397
It's for her.

145
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,152
You listen carefully

146
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,529
You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

147
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,032
We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

148
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,993
Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block

149
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,162
before you can make the lobby.

150
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,921
- We need you to come in.  - Are you kidding? I'm working.

151
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,255
This takes precedence.

152
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,257
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

153
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,009
This moron is giving me everything.

154
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,054
I don't give everything.

155
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,890
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

156
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,974
Natasha...

157
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,061
Barton's been compromised.

158
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,316
Let me put you on hold.

159
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,025
Where is Barton now?

160
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,485
- We don't know.  - But he's alive?

161
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,530
We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.

162
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,991
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

163
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,327
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

164
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,664
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

165
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,690
Who are you?

166
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,317
Get out!

167
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,944
There is sickness here!

168
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,029
You're a doctor.

169
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,073
My father's not waking up!

170
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,783
He has a fever and he's moaning

171
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,035
but his eyes won't open.

172
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,119
Slow down.

173
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,663
My father...

174
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,334
Like them?

175
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,631
Please.

176
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:33,118
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

177
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,620
You know, for a man

178
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,996
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

179
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,249
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

180
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,337
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

181
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,756
Then what is it? Yoga?

182
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,511
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

183
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:55,140
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

184
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,975
Just you and me.

185
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,270
And your actress buddy?

186
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,189
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

187
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,108
I did.

188
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,359
Who are you?

189
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,443
Natasha Romanoff.

190
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,365
Are you here to kill me, Ms.Romanoff?

191
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,118
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

192
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,620
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

193
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,040
S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:22,960
How did they find me?

195
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,545
We never lost you, Doctor.

196
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,088
We've kept our distance.

197
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,881
Even helped keep some other interested parties

198
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,091
off your scent.

199
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:30,718
Why?

200
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,220
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

201
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,722
But now we need you to come in.

202
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,599
What if I say no?

203
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,018
I'll persuade you.

204
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:46,692
And what if the other guy says no?

205
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,027
You've been more than a year without an incident.

206
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,488
I don't think you want to break that streak.

207
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,660
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

208
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,621
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

209
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,584
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

210
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,253
This

211
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,547
is the Tesseract.

212
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,508
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

213
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,513
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

214
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,266
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

215
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,521
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

216
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,649
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

217
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,319
If there was, that's where I'd be.

218
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,155
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

219
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:34,865
Not that he's told me.

220
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,242
And he tells you everything?

221
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,495
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

222
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,746
He needs me in a cage?

223
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,789
No one's going to put you in a...

224
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:42,706
Stop lying to me!

225
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,588
I'm sorry. That was mean.

226
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,716
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

227
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,887
Why don't we do this the easy way

228
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,347
where you don't use that

229
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:02,226
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

230
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,561
Okay?

231
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,897
Natasha?

232
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,612
Stand down.

233
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,114
We're good here.

234
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,243
"Just you and me."

235
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,248
This is out of line, Director.

236
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,875
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

237
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,754
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

238
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,757
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

239
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:37,344
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

240
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,097
Not Asgard. Loki.

241
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,100
He can't be working alone. What about the other one?

242
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,268
His brother.

243
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,311
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

244
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,604
but he's worlds away.

245
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,606
We can't depend on him to help, either.

246
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,691
It's up to us.

247
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,443
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

248
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,778
It was designed for exactly this...

249
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,948
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

250
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,117
We need a response team.

251
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,452
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

252
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,454
This isn't about the Avengers.

253
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:05,956
We've seen the list.

254
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,375
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

255
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,127
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

256
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,545
to a handful of freaks.

257
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,589
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

258
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,674
We need a response team.

259
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,969
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even

260
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:23,223
but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.

261
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,975
You believe?

262
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:28,478
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

263
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,816
No, it's won by soldiers.

264
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,795
There's not enough time.

265
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,672
I got to put her in the water!

266
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,012
You won't be alone.

267
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,014
Oh, my God.

268
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,849
This guy is still alive!

269
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,626
Trouble sleeping?

270
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,380
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

271
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,802
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.

272
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,769
When I went under, the world was at war.

273
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,479
I wake up, they say we won.

274
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,731
They didn't say what we lost.

275
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,693
We've made some mistakes along the way.

276
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,736
Some, very recently.

277
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,823
Are you here with a mission, sir?

278
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,949
I am.

279
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,450
Trying to get me back in the world?

280
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,619
Trying to save it.

281
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,584
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

282
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,545
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean

283
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,796
when he was looking for you.

284
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,965
He thought what we think.

285
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,386
The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.

286
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,724
That's something the world sorely needs.

287
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,685
Who took it from you?

288
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,311
He's called Loki.

289
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,772
He's not from around here.

290
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,692
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on

291
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,027
if you're in.

292
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,654
The world has gotten even stranger

293
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:43,905
than you already know.

294
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,992
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.

295
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,286
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

296
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,706
There's a debriefing packet

297
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,208
waiting for you back at your apartment.

298
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,337
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract

299
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,839
that we ought to know now?

300
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,467
You should have left it in the ocean.

301
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,044
Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.

302
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,587
You disconnected the transmission lines?

303
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,755
Are we off the grid?

304
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,007
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon

305
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,467
of self-sustaining clean energy.

306
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,803
Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over

307
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,179
and it actually works.

308
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,806
I assume.

309
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,015
Light her up.

310
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:58,855
How does it look?

311
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,691
Like Christmas, but with more me.

312
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,485
We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.

313
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,653
You need to do some press.

314
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,321
I'm in DC tomorrow,

315
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,906
I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.

316
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,200
Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?

317
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,868
Enjoy the moment.

318
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:12,953
Get in here and I will.

319
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,459
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

320
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,044
I'm not in.

321
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,046
I'm actually out.

322
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,889
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

323
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,517
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

324
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,316
Levels are holding steady, I think.

325
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,694
Of course they are. I was directly involved.

326
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,070
Which brings me to my next question.

327
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,239
How does it feel to be a genius?

328
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,658
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

329
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:56,371
What do you mean? All this came from you.

330
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,916
No, all this came from that.

331
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,502
Give yourself some credit. Please.

332
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,713
Stark Tower is your baby.

333
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,007
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

334
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,633
12%?

335
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,968
An argument can be made for 15.

336
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,845
12%? My baby?

337
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,680
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

338
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,265
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

339
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,185
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

340
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,769
That was on you.

341
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,813
- My private elevator...  - You mean our elevator?

342
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,858
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

343
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,444
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages

344
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,237
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

345
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,281
It's not going to be that subtle.

346
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,741
I'll tell you what.

347
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,202
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.

348
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,745
On the lease.

349
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,040
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

350
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,499
Sir, the telephone.

351
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,127
I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.

352
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,004
Mr Stark, we need to talk.

353
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,673
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.

354
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,967
- Please leave a message.  - This is urgent.

355
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,094
Then leave it urgently.

356
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:55,805
Security breach. It's on you.

357
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,600
- Mr Stark.  - Phil! Come in.

358
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,684
"Phil"?

359
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,852
I can't stay.

360
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,437
His first name is "Agent."

361
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,189
Come on in. We're celebrating.

362
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,107
Which is why he can't stay.

363
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,485
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

364
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,694
I don't like being handed things.

365
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,154
That's fine, because I love to be handed things.

366
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,697
So, let's trade.

367
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,784
Thank you.

368
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,037
Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5

369
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,121
every other Thursday.

370
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,498
This isn't a consultation.

371
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,666
Is this about the Avengers?

372
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,168
Which I know nothing about.

373
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,879
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

374
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,297
And I didn't even qualify.

375
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,382
I didn't know that either.

376
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,718
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

377
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:34,928
don't play well with others.

378
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,388
That I did know.

379
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,181
This isn't about personality profiles any more.

380
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,684
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

381
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,851
Half a mo.

382
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,276
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

383
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:50,986
I was having 12% of a moment.

384
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,948
This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.

385
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,117
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

386
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,077
What is all this?

387
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,870
This is

388
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,497
this.

389
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:10,964
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

390
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,173
Tomorrow.

391
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,718
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.

392
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,761
Well, What if I didn't?

393
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,763
- If you didn't?  - Yeah.

394
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,141
You mean when you've finished?

395
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,520
Well, then...

396
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:31,735
Square deal. Fly safe.

397
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,365
Work hard.

398
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,995
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?

399
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,956
- I can drop you.  - Fantastic.

400
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,082
I want to hear

401
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,917
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

402
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,252
She moved back to Portland.

403
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,130
What? Boo!

404
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:03,016
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

405
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:10,398
So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

406
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,150
A lot of people were.

407
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,777
You were the world's first superhero.

408
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,447
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking

409
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,782
Erskine's original formula.

410
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,076
Didn't really go his way, did it?

411
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,203
Not so much.

412
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,955
When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

413
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,460
He's like a smart person.

414
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,880
I gotta say,

415
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,466
it's an honour to meet you officially.

416
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,135
I've sort of met you. I mean,

417
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,804
I watched you while you were sleeping.

418
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,141
I mean, I was present

419
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:48,645
while you were unconscious from the ice.

420
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,106
You know, it's really just a huge honour

421
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:52,941
to have you on board this...

422
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,443
I hope I'm the man for the job.

423
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,530
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

424
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,658
We made some modifications to the uniform.

425
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,326
I had a little design input.

426
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,744
The uniform?

427
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,497
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

428
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,833
old-fashioned?

429
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,752
With everything that's happening

430
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,504
and the things that are about to come to light,

431
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:18,967
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

432
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,711
The Chitauri grow restless.

433
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,629
Let them gird themselves.

434
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,381
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

435
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,549
Battle?

436
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,803
Against the meagre might of Earth?

437
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,848
Glorious, not lengthy.

438
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,894
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

439
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,313
You question us?

440
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,899
You question him,

441
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,526
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

442
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,404
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

443
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,824
when you were cast out, defeated?

444
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,826
I was a king!

445
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,245
The rightful king of Asgard,

446
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,413
betrayed.

447
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,917
Your ambition is little

448
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,753
and born of childish need.

449
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,214
We look beyond the Earth

450
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,133
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

451
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,093
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

452
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:47,805
I don't threaten.

453
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,185
But until I open the doors,

454
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:56,022
until your force is mine to command,

455
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,566
you are but words.

456
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:02,737
You will have your war, Asgardian.

457
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,533
If you fail,

458
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:11,955
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

459
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:16,501
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

460
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:20,004
no crevice where he cannot find you.

461
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,342
You think you know pain?

462
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:29,931
He will make you long for something sweet as pain.

463
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:00,461
Stow the captain's gear.

464
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:01,588
Yes, sir.

465
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:06,259
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

466
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,760
- Ma'am.  - Hi.

467
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:08,928
They need you on the bridge.

468
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,555
They're starting the face-trace.

469
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:11,848
See you there.

470
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,437
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

471
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,607
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

472
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,693
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

473
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,111
Trading cards?

474
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,280
They're vintage. He's very proud.

475
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,533
Dr Banner.

476
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,536
Yeah, hi.

477
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,288
They told me you would be coming.

478
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,706
Word is, you can find the Cube.

479
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,667
Is that the only word on me?

480
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,252
Only word I care about.

481
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,466
It must be strange for you, all of this.

482
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,969
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

483
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,722
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

484
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,892
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

485
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,394
Flight crew, secure the deck.

486
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,776
Is this a submarine?

487
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:06,319
Really?

488
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:10,239
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

489
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,643
No, no, this is much worse.

490
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,509
Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.

491
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,803
Increase collective to 8.0%.

492
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,519
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

493
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,146
Increase output to capacity.

494
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,440
Power plant performing at capacity.

495
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,150
We are clear.

496
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,818
All engines operating.

497
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:33,656
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

498
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,492
- We are at level, sir.  - Good.

499
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:37,827
Let's vanish.

500
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,163
Engage retro-reflection panels.

501
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,221
Reflection panels engaged.

502
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,390
Gentlemen.

503
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,528
Doctor, thank you for coming.

504
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,741
Thanks for asking nicely.

505
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,368
So, how long am I staying?

506
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,329
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

507
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,663
you're in the wind.

508
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,624
Where are you with that?

509
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,542
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

510
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:27,627
camera on the planet.

511
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,213
Cell phones, laptops...

512
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,050
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

513
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,426
That's still not gonna find them in time.

514
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,594
You have to narrow your field.

515
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,763
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

516
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,890
- How many are there?  - Call every lab you know.

517
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,809
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

518
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,227
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

519
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,522
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

520
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,274
At least we could rule out a few places.

521
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,568
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

522
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:53,945
Agent Romanoff,

523
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,155
could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please?

524
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,492
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

525
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,078
Put it over there.

526
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,165
Where did you find all these people?

527
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,168
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

528
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:10,920
Is this the stuff you need?

529
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,088
Yeah, iridium.

530
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,841
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

531
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,676
It's very hard to get hold of.

532
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,553
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

533
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,054
Well, I didn't know.

534
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,430
Hey!

535
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,724
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

536
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,185
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

537
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,270
I know.

538
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,897
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

539
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,441
My next target.

540
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,526
Tell me what you need.

541
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,073
I need a distraction.

542
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:41,284
And an eyeball.

543
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,543
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

544
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,711
No, no. It's fine.

545
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,632
It's a vintage set.

546
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,093
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

547
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:02,722
Near mint.

548
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,307
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

549
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,893
We got a hit. A 67% match.

550
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,936
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

551
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,314
Location?

552
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:14,483
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 K?nigstrasse.

553
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,818
He's not exactly hiding.

554
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:16,986
Captain,

555
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,487
you're up.

556
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,269
Kneel before me.

557
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,025
I said

558
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,987
kneel!

559
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,958
ls not this simpler?

560
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:22,713
Is this not your natural state?

561
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:28,219
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

562
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,805
that you crave subjugation.

563
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:35,142
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

564
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,770
in a mad scramble for power,

565
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,190
for identity.

566
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:46,195
You were made to be ruled.

567
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,114
In the end,

568
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,658
you will always kneel.

569
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,042
Not to men like you.

570
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,003
There are no men like me.

571
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,841
There are always men like you.

572
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:09,885
Look to your elder, people.

573
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,597
Let him be an example.

574
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:23,149
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

575
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:26,569
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

576
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,237
we ended up disagreeing.

577
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:30,072
The soldier.

578
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,534
The man out of time.

579
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,244
I'm not the one who's out of time.

580
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,250
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

581
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,522
Kneel.

582
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:04,815
Not today!

583
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,152
The guy's all over the place.

584
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:14,033
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

585
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,093
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

586
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,311
Good move.

587
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,356
Mr Stark.

588
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,191
Captain.

589
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:56,033
Is he saying anything?

590
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,201
Not a word.

591
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,578
Just get him here. We're low on time.

592
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,582
I don't like it.

593
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,001
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

594
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,836
I don't remember it being that easy.

595
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,588
This guy packs a wallop.

596
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:13,384
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

597
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:15,928
What's your thing, Pilates?

598
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,012
What?

599
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,264
It's like calisthenics.

600
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,349
You might have missed a couple of things

601
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,101
doing time as a Capsicle.

602
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:25,854
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

603
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,732
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

604
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:30,734
Where's this coming from?

605
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,283
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

606
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,035
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

607
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,054
What are you doing?

608
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,652
And now there's that guy.

609
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,612
Another Asgardian?

610
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,656
- That guy's a friendly?  - Doesn't matter.

611
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:20,451
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

612
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,369
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

613
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,830
I have a plan. Attack.

614
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:32,671
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

615
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,006
I don't see how I can.

616
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:36,675
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

617
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,594
There's only one God, ma'am.

618
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:41,096
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

619
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,780
Where is the Tesseract?

620
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,448
I missed you, too.

621
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,116
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

622
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,118
You should thank me.

623
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,954
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy

624
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,874
did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here

625
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,209
to your precious Earth?

626
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,714
I thought you dead.

627
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,759
Did you mourn?

628
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:20,969
We all did. Our father...

629
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,181
Your father.

630
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,186
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

631
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,982
We were raised together.

632
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,819
We played together, we fought together.

633
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,529
Do you remember none of that?

634
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,697
I remember a shadow.

635
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,868
Living in the shade of your greatness.

636
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,580
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

637
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:50,707
I, who was, and should be, king!

638
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,001
So you take the world I love as a recompense

639
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:55,003
for your imagined slights?

640
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,257
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

641
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:02,970
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

642
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:05,722
The humans slaughter each other in droves

643
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,641
while you idly fret.

644
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,935
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

645
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,395
You think yourself above them?

646
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:13,772
Well, yes.

647
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,442
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

648
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,360
A throne would suit you ill.

649
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:26,368
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

650
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:30,831
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

651
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,375
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

652
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:34,626
and when I wield it...

653
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,545
Who showed you this power?

654
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:38,964
Who controls the would-be king?

655
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,049
- I am a king!  - Not here!

656
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,509
You give up the Tesseract!

657
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:45,220
You give up this poisonous dream!

658
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,057
You come home.

659
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,147
I don't have it.

660
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:59,359
You need the Cube to bring me home.

661
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:01,445
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

662
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,698
You listen well, brother.

663
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,534
I'm listening.

664
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:18,378
Do not touch me again.

665
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:20,172
Then don't take my stuff.

666
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:22,591
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

667
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:25,469
Shakespeare in the Park?

668
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:30,098
Does mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

669
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:33,268
This is beyond you, metal man.

670
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,229
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

671
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:39,149
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

672
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,526
stay out of the way.

673
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,904
Tourist.

674
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,202
Okay.

675
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:23,151
Power at 400% capacity.

676
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,570
How about that?

677
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,214
Hey!

678
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:30,177
That's enough.

679
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,515
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

680
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,143
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

681
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,687
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

682
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:41,772
Yeah... No.

683
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,482
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

684
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,402
You want me to put the hammer down?

685
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,682
Are we done, here?

686
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,524
In case it's unclear,

687
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,026
if you try to escape,

688
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,196
if you so much as scratch that glass,

689
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:26,710
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

690
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,671
You get how that works?

691
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,342
Ant, boot.

692
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,181
It's an impressive cage.

693
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:42,684
Not built, I think, for me.

694
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:45,187
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

695
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:47,856
Oh, I've heard.

696
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:49,733
A mindless beast.

697
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,360
Makes play he's still a man.

698
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,947
How desperate are you,

699
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:59,242
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

700
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,536
How desperate am I?

701
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,830
You threaten my world with war.

702
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:06,166
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

703
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:10,170
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

704
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:13,381
You have made me very desperate.

705
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,300
You might not be glad that you did.

706
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,057
It burns you to have come so close.

707
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,894
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

708
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:29,231
unlimited power.

709
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,399
And for what?

710
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:36,613
A warm light for all mankind to share.

711
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:40,200
And then to be reminded what real power is.

712
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:48,500
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

713
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,468
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

714
00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:00,595
Loki's gonna drag this out.

715
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:04,266
So, Thor, what's his play?

716
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:07,060
He has an army called the Chitauri.

717
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:10,146
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

718
00:53:10,564 --> 00:53:12,691
He means to lead them against your people.

719
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,484
They will win him the Earth,

720
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:16,403
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

721
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,321
An army

722
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,240
from outer space.

723
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,826
So, he's building another portal.

724
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:24,286
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

725
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,370
Selvig?

726
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,039
- He's an astrophysicist.  - He's a friend.

727
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,375
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

728
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,002
along with one of ours.

729
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,837
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

730
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,255
He's not leading an army from here.

731
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,132
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

732
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:39,175
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

733
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,510
You could smell crazy on him.

734
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,429
Have care how you speak.

735
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,973
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

736
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,600
And he is my brother.

737
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:48,685
He killed 80 people in two days.

738
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,645
He's adopted.

739
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:53,189
I think it's about the mechanics.

740
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,358
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

741
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:56,484
It's a stabilising agent.

742
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:58,028
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

743
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,696
I'll fly you to Portland.

744
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,489
Keep love alive.

745
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,575
It means the portal won't collapse on itself

746
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,577
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

747
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:09,039
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

748
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,499
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

749
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,169
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

750
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,838
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

751
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,758
That man is playing Galaga.

752
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:24,387
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

753
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,557
How does Fury even see these?

754
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:28,683
He turns.

755
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,852
Sounds exhausting.

756
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,104
The rest of the raw materials,

757
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,066
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

758
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,692
The only major component he still needs

759
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,363
is a power source of high-energy density.

760
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,658
Something to kick-start the Cube.

761
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:47,744
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

762
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:48,912
Last night.

763
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,916
The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers.

764
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,125
Am I the only one who did the reading?

765
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:57,087
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

766
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,048
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

767
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,716
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

768
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:04,135
Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise

769
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,428
the quantum tunnelling effect.

770
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,805
Well, if he could do that,

771
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,349
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

772
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,893
Finally, someone who speaks English.

773
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,937
Is that what just happened?

774
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,272
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

775
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,567
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

776
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,569
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

777
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,613
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

778
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,408
Thanks.

779
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,077
Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.

780
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:30,578
I was hoping you might join him.

781
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:31,746
I would start with that stick of his.

782
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,039
It may be magical,

783
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:34,582
but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.

784
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,585
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

785
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,713
And I would like to know how Loki used it

786
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,589
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

787
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,425
into his personal flying monkeys.

788
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

789
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:46,386
I do.

790
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,099
I understood that reference.

791
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,643
Shall we play, Doctor?

792
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,437
This way, sir.

793
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,119
The gamma readings are definitely consistent

794
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,079
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

795
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,373
But it's going to take weeks to process.

796
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,791
If we bypass their mainframe

797
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,168
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

798
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,463
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

799
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,632
All I packed was a toothbrush.

800
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,302
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

801
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,471
Top ten floors, all R&D.

802
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,306
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

803
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:34,059
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

804
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,811
I kind of broke Harlem.

805
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,813
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

806
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,815
No tension, no surprises.

807
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,735
- Hey!  - Nothing?

808
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,903
Are you nuts?

809
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:45,987
Jury's out.

810
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,405
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?

811
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:48,490
What's your secret?

812
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:50,075
Mellow jazz, bongo drums huge bag of weed?

813
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,159
Is everything a joke to you?

814
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:52,619
Funny things are.

815
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,579
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship

816
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,955
isn't funny.

817
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,040
No offence, Doc.

818
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,750
It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard

819
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,711
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

820
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:04,172
You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.

821
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:06,216
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.

822
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:07,675
Do you think I'm not?

823
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:10,762
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

824
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,555
What isn't he telling us?

825
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,182
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

826
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:16,142
You think Fury's hiding something?

827
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:19,646
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

828
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,564
His secrets have secrets.

829
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:23,191
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

830
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,861
I just want to finish my work here, and...

831
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:28,530
Doctor?

832
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:36,454
"A warm light for all mankind."

833
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,540
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

834
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:39,999
I heard it.

835
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,418
I think that was meant for you.

836
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,339
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

837
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,465
it was still all over the news.

838
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,634
The Stark Tower? The big, ugly

839
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,095
building in New York?

840
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:56,182
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

841
00:57:56,266 --> 00:57:58,768
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

842
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:00,687
It's just the prototype.

843
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,647
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

844
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:04,482
That's what he's getting at.

845
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:07,235
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project?

846
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,195
What are they doing in the energy business

847
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,572
in the first place?

848
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,741
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme

849
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,827
finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

850
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,870
I'm sorry. Did you say...

851
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:19,080
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

852
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,999
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret

853
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:22,333
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

854
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:23,376
Blueberry?

855
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,211
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

856
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:28,173
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

857
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,133
Historically, not awesome.

858
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,510
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

859
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:34,220
This is a man who means to start a war

860
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:35,763
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

861
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,559
We have orders. We should follow them.

862
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,936
Following's not really my style.

863
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:45,732
And you're all about style, aren't you?

864
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:46,900
Of the people in this room,

865
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:48,651
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

866
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:49,903
and, B, not of use?

867
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:54,282
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

868
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,077
Just find the Cube.

869
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,967
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

870
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:16,429
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

871
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,932
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

872
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:20,850
He does have the jump on us.

873
00:59:20,934 --> 00:59:23,686
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

874
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,605
It's going to blow up in his face.

875
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,815
And I'm going to be there when it does.

876
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,485
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

877
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:33,738
Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

878
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:39,077
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

879
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,580
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

880
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:44,165
It's a nightmare.

881
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:47,377
I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second

882
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,504
to crawl its way into my heart.

883
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,673
This stops it.

884
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,925
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

885
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,844
not just armour.

886
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,931
It's a terrible privilege.

887
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,684
- But you can control it.  - Because I learned how.

888
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:03,768
It's different.

889
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:07,605
Hey, I read all about your accident.

890
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:10,900
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

891
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,695
So you're saying that the Hulk...

892
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,282
The other guy saved my life?

893
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:18,950
That's nice.

894
01:00:19,993 --> 01:00:23,705
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

895
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,874
I guess we'll find out.

896
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,420
You may not enjoy that.

897
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,505
And you just might.

898
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,107
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

899
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:34,984
we moved Jane Foster.

900
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:37,487
They've got an excellent observatory in Troms.

901
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:41,157
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

902
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:45,078
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

903
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:46,871
She'll be safe.

904
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,456
Thank you.

905
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,085
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

906
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,713
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

907
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:56,964
Erik is a good man.

908
01:01:57,048 --> 01:01:58,091
He talks about you a lot.

909
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,136
You changed his life.

910
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,723
You changed everything around here.

911
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:07,975
They were better as they were.

912
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,686
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

913
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,524
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

914
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,484
- Like what?  - Bilge snipe.

915
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,320
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

916
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:22,240
- You don't have those?  - I don't think so.

917
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,242
Well, they are repulsive.

918
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,829
And they trample everything in their path.

919
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,756
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

920
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,092
and your people paid the price.

921
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:43,177
And now, again.

922
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,182
In my youth, I courted war.

923
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,978
War hasn't started yet.

924
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:54,897
You think you could make Loki tell us

925
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,274
where the Tesseract is?

926
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:59,694
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

927
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:04,532
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

928
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,451
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

929
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,079
A lot of guys think that

930
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,414
until the pain starts.

931
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,460
What are you asking me to do?

932
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

933
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,214
Loki is a prisoner.

934
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:22,800
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat

935
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:24,260
that wants to be here?

936
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,234
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

937
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:41,903
But you figured I'd come.

938
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,071
After.

939
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,576
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

940
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:52,371
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

941
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,832
And I would cooperate.

942
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,959
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

943
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,045
I would say I've expanded his mind.

944
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,758
And once you've won,

945
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,593
once you're king of the mountain,

946
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,556
what happens to his mind?

947
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:13,392
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

948
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,312
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

949
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,109
Tell me.

950
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,909
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I...

951
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:36,207
Well, I made a name for myself.

952
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,377
I have a very specific skill set.

953
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,880
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

954
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:47,426
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

955
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:51,764
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

956
01:04:52,765 --> 01:04:54,141
He made a different call.

957
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:59,146
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

958
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:00,982
Not let you out.

959
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,984
No, but I like this.

960
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:07,196
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

961
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,574
Regimes fall every day.

962
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:12,034
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

963
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:13,160
Or I was.

964
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:16,163
And what are you now?

965
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,792
It's really not that complicated.

966
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:24,005
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

967
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:26,340
Can you?

968
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:31,679
Can you wipe out that much red?

969
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,348
Dreykov's daughter,

970
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,893
St Paulo,

971
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,230
the hospital fire?

972
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:44,609
Barton told me everything.

973
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:47,570
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

974
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,489
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

975
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:51,949
will change anything?

976
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:54,785
This is the basest sentimentality.

977
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,121
This is a child at prayer.

978
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,372
Pathetic!

979
01:05:59,332 --> 01:06:01,959
You lie and kill

980
01:06:02,043 --> 01:06:05,129
in the service of liars and killers.

981
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:11,218
You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,

982
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:14,221
something that makes up for the horrors.

983
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:17,808
But they are part of you.

984
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:21,479
And they will never go away.

985
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:25,816
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

986
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,152
Slowly, intimately,

987
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,696
in every way he knows you fear.

988
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,616
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

989
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,495
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

990
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:40,414
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

991
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:43,918
You're a monster.

992
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:47,588
Oh, no.

993
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:49,757
You brought the monster.

994
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,428
So, Banner.

995
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,597
That's your play.

996
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:57,848
What?

997
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,476
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

998
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,103
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

999
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:03,270
Send Thor as well.

1000
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:06,315
Thank you

1001
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:08,776
for your cooperation.

1002
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,702
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1003
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:20,371
Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

1004
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,373
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

1005
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:23,749
We are. The model's locked

1006
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,501
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1007
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:26,877
When we get a hit,

1008
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,462
we'll have the location within half a mile.

1009
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:33,050
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1010
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:34,176
What is "Phase 2"?

1011
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:39,390
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

1012
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,267
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

1013
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:44,061
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

1014
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:45,438
This does not mean that we're making...

1015
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:46,522
I'm sorry, Nick.

1016
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:48,983
What were you lying?

1017
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,359
I was wrong, Director.

1018
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,569
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1019
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:52,653
Did you know about this?

1020
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:54,655
You want to think about removing yourself

1021
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:55,865
from this environment, Doctor?

1022
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:57,825
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

1023
01:07:58,117 --> 01:07:59,452
Loki is manipulating you.

1024
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,036
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1025
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,663
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

1026
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:03,998
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1027
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,458
because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1028
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,376
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1029
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,088
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

1030
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:12,965
Because of him.

1031
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:14,842
Me?

1032
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:18,596
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

1033
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,891
who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.

1034
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,101
We learned that not only are we not alone

1035
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,938
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

1036
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:30,149
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

1037
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:32,401
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

1038
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,361
And you're not the only threat.

1039
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,531
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

1040
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:39,533
that can't be controlled.

1041
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:40,910
Like you controlled the Cube?

1042
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:42,286
Your work with the Tesseract

1043
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,955
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1044
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:46,499
It is a signal to all the realms

1045
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:49,293
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

1046
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,461
A higher form?

1047
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:51,670
You forced our hand.

1048
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:52,755
We had to come up with something.

1049
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:53,839
A nuclear deterrent.

1050
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:56,008
Because that always calms everything right down.

1051
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,511
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

1052
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:00,763
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

1053
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,765
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1054
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:03,974
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1055
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:06,018
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

1056
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,021
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

1057
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,981
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

1058
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,608
Are you boys really that naive?

1059
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,610
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1060
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,028
Captain America's on threat watch?

1061
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,112
We all are.

1062
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,697
Wait, you're on that list?

1063
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:20,366
Are you above or below angry bees?

1064
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,618
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

1065
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,994
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1066
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:26,580
- Show some respect.  - Respect what?

1067
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:36,882
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

1068
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:39,176
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

1069
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,345
What is your haul? Over.

1070
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,848
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1071
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,692
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

1072
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,360
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1073
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,862
I mean, what are we, a team?

1074
01:09:57,945 --> 01:10:00,990
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

1075
01:10:01,073 --> 01:10:02,783
We're a time bomb.

1076
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:05,035
You need to step away.

1077
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:06,996
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

1078
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:09,206
You know damn well why. Back off!

1079
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,542
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1080
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:15,254
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1081
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:16,672
Take that off, what are you?

1082
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:19,258
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

1083
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:23,220
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

1084
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:24,388
I've seen the footage.

1085
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:26,640
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

1086
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,227
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

1087
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:32,730
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

1088
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,899
I think I would just cut the wire.

1089
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:40,029
Always a way out.

1090
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:41,405
You may not be a threat

1091
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:43,324
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

1092
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,035
A hero? Like you?

1093
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,203
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1094
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:51,707
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

1095
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:19,777
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1096
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:24,531
You people are so petty and tiny.

1097
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:25,658
Yeah, this is a team.

1098
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:26,867
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1099
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:27,993
Dr Banner back to his...

1100
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,828
Where? You rented my room.

1101
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,789
The cell was just in case...

1102
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:33,290
In case you needed to kill me.

1103
01:11:33,374 --> 01:11:36,043
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1104
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:41,966
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1105
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:46,428
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

1106
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,389
So I moved on.

1107
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:51,058
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

1108
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:53,560
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

1109
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:54,895
and put everyone here at risk.

1110
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,398
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

1111
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,066
You want to know how I stay calm?

1112
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:04,071
Dr Banner,

1113
01:12:04,947 --> 01:12:06,323
put down the sceptre.

1114
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,375
Got it.

1115
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:17,960
Sorry, kids,

1116
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:19,920
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

1117
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:21,088
You located the Tesseract?

1118
01:12:21,213 --> 01:12:22,214
I could get there fastest.

1119
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:24,466
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

1120
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:25,884
- You're not going alone.  - You're gonna stop me?

1121
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,052
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1122
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:28,429
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1123
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:29,513
Put on the suit.

1124
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:33,934
Oh, my God.

1125
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,701
Put on the suit.

1126
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,119
Yeah.

1127
01:12:54,872 --> 01:12:56,623
All hands to stations.

1128
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:02,463
- Hill!  - External detonation.

1129
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:03,964
Number three engine is down.

1130
01:13:04,048 --> 01:13:05,049
We've been hit.

1131
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:06,383
- Can they get it running?  - Fire in engine three!

1132
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,468
Talk to me.

1133
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,261
Turbine looks mostly intact

1134
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,263
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs

1135
01:13:11,346 --> 01:13:12,806
while we're in the air.

1136
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:15,476
If we lose one more engine, we won't be.

1137
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,603
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

1138
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:19,146
- Stark, you copy that?  - I'm on it.

1139
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:22,649
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section

1140
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:23,817
then get to the armoury.

1141
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:24,985
Romanoff?

1142
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:29,990
We're okay.

1143
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:33,911
We're okay, right?

1144
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:47,966
- Keep that engine down!  - Yes, sir.

1145
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,760
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1146
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,720
- Got it.  - Stay close.

1147
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,973
Let's go, Level 4.

1148
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,477
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1149
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,070
Doctor?

1150
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,031
Bruce?

1151
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,119
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

1152
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,621
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1153
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:18,705
Are you hurt?

1154
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:24,169
We're going to be okay. All right?

1155
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:27,381
I swear on my life, I will get you out of this.

1156
01:14:27,673 --> 01:14:28,841
You will walk away and never ever...

1157
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:30,759
Your life?

1158
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:48,235
Bruce.

1159
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:28,609
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1160
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,527
- Take us to the water!  - We're flying blind.

1161
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,613
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

1162
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,281
Is the sun coming up?

1163
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:37,284
- Yes, sir.  - Then put it on the left.

1164
01:15:37,618 --> 01:15:39,119
Get us over water.

1165
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:41,246
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

1166
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,125
Thanks.

1167
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,630
Stark!

1168
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:54,009
Stark, I'm here!

1169
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,302
Good.

1170
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:58,847
Let's see what we've got.

1171
01:15:58,931 --> 01:16:00,557
I got to get this superconducting coolant system

1172
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:01,725
back online

1173
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,352
before I can access the rotors,

1174
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,020
work on dislodging the debris.

1175
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,149
I need you to get to that engine control panel

1176
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:12,945
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

1177
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:26,833
What does it look like in there?

1178
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:30,045
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

1179
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:31,922
Well, you're not wrong.

1180
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:38,655
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1181
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:39,781
Try to think!

1182
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,793
Okay, the relays are intact.

1183
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:53,253
What's our next move?

1184
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:54,629
Even if I clear the rotors,

1185
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,882
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1186
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,258
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1187
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:00,177
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

1188
01:18:00,469 --> 01:18:02,512
That stator control unit can reverse the polarity

1189
01:18:02,596 --> 01:18:03,930
long enough to disengage maglev and that could...

1190
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:05,265
Speak English!

1191
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:07,809
You see that red lever?

1192
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,188
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

1193
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:13,106
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1194
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,411
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1195
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:11,957
Grenade!

1196
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:28,432
We've got a perimeter breach!

1197
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:30,600
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1198
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:32,811
Call-outs at every junction.

1199
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:42,279
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

1200
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:43,864
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1201
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,032
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1202
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:48,201
Get his attention.

1203
01:19:48,535 --> 01:19:52,747
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

1204
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,166
Don't get too close.

1205
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,375
Copy.

1206
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:08,847
Target acquired.

1207
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:14,060
Target engaged.

1208
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,240
Target angry, target angry!

1209
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,894
They're not getting through here, so what the hell...

1210
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:58,707
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1211
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,301
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1212
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:11,094
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1213
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:13,680
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

1214
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:16,266
He's headed for the detention level.

1215
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,351
Does anybody copy?

1216
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:21,688
This is Agent Romanoff.

1217
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:23,273
I copy.

1218
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,653
Stark, we 're losing altitude.

1219
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,238
Yeah, I noticed.

1220
01:22:59,351 --> 01:23:00,352
No!

1221
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,528
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1222
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,116
The humans think us immortal.

1223
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:58,743
Should we test that?

1224
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:02,455
Move away, please.

1225
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:08,461
You like this?

1226
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:12,632
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

1227
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:16,136
Even I don't know what it does.

1228
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:18,430
Do you want to find out?

1229
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,641
No!

1230
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:32,837
Natasha?

1231
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:06,162
You're going to lose.

1232
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,249
Am I?

1233
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:13,211
It's in your nature.

1234
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:17,715
Your heroes are scattered.

1235
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:21,553
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1236
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:22,929
Where is my disadvantage?

1237
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:25,765
You lack conviction.

1238
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:27,767
I don't think I'm...

1239
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:36,276
So, that's what it does.

1240
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,113
All hands to crash stations immediately.

1241
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:09,934
Cap, hit the lever.

1242
01:27:10,602 --> 01:27:12,937
I need a minute here!

1243
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:14,397
Lever!

1244
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,481
Now!

1245
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:28,786
Help!

1246
01:28:04,364 --> 01:28:05,782
Sorry, boss.

1247
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,408
The god rabbited.

1248
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,202
Just stay awake.

1249
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:10,745
Eyes on me.

1250
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,413
No, I'm clocking out here.

1251
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:13,873
Not an option.

1252
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,210
It's okay, boss.

1253
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:21,172
This was never gonna work

1254
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:22,423
if they didn't have something

1255
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,343
to...

1256
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:56,416
Agent Coulson is down.

1257
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,502
A medical team is on its way to your location.

1258
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,087
They're here.

1259
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,925
They called it.

1260
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,818
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1261
01:29:27,155 --> 01:29:29,323
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1262
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,662
We're dead in the air up here.

1263
01:29:34,746 --> 01:29:37,874
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

1264
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,418
Banner, Thor...

1265
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:43,629
I got nothing for you.

1266
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:46,632
I lost my one good eye.

1267
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:52,597
Maybe I had that coming.

1268
01:29:56,893 --> 01:29:58,227
Yes,

1269
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,732
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1270
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,069
I never put all my chips on that number, though

1271
01:30:06,152 --> 01:30:09,280
because I was playing something even riskier.

1272
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,330
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1273
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:22,585
called the Avengers Initiative.

1274
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,922
The idea was to bring together a group

1275
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,591
of remarkable people

1276
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:32,178
to see if they could become something more.

1277
01:30:33,513 --> 01:30:37,517
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

1278
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,978
to fight the battles that we never could.

1279
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:48,861
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

1280
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:52,865
In heroes.

1281
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,500
Well,

1282
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:06,045
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1283
01:31:26,274 --> 01:31:28,609
You fell out of the sky.

1284
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:44,083
Did I hurt anybody?

1285
01:31:44,417 --> 01:31:47,503
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1286
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:50,923
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

1287
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:52,842
Lucky.

1288
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:54,260
Or just good aim.

1289
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:55,970
You were awake when you fell.

1290
01:31:58,306 --> 01:32:00,099
- You saw?  - The whole thing.

1291
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:01,934
Right through the ceiling.

1292
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:06,230
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1293
01:32:06,314 --> 01:32:07,481
Here.

1294
01:32:08,816 --> 01:32:11,027
Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down

1295
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,613
to a regular-size feller.

1296
01:32:15,907 --> 01:32:17,241
Thank you.

1297
01:32:17,992 --> 01:32:19,160
Are you an alien?

1298
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:20,995
What?

1299
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:22,663
From outer space, an alien.

1300
01:32:23,206 --> 01:32:24,248
No.

1301
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:27,793
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1302
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:40,973
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1303
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:46,646
You know that?

1304
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:49,315
Is that what you know?

1305
01:32:51,776 --> 01:32:54,654
I've got no window.

1306
01:32:55,238 --> 01:32:56,656
I have to flush him out.

1307
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,575
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

1308
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,077
You don't understand.

1309
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:06,165
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

1310
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:11,462
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1311
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:16,717
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1312
01:33:18,511 --> 01:33:20,680
You know that I do.

1313
01:33:28,187 --> 01:33:29,230
Why am I back?

1314
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:32,066
How did you get him out?

1315
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:34,860
Cognitive recalibration.

1316
01:33:35,111 --> 01:33:37,655
I hit you really hard on the head.

1317
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:38,864
Thanks.

1318
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:44,870
Natasha...

1319
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:46,664
How many agents did I...

1320
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:48,291
Don't.

1321
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:50,626
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1322
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:53,087
This is Loki.

1323
01:33:53,421 --> 01:33:55,798
This is monsters and magic,

1324
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:57,258
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1325
01:33:57,425 --> 01:33:58,968
Loki, did he get away?

1326
01:33:59,051 --> 01:34:00,052
Yeah.

1327
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:02,763
I don't suppose you know where.

1328
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,890
I didn't need to know.

1329
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,726
I didn't ask.

1330
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:12,231
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1331
01:34:12,606 --> 01:34:13,649
Today.

1332
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:15,026
We got to stop him.

1333
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,986
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1334
01:34:17,194 --> 01:34:19,030
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1335
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:21,907
Well...

1336
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:25,745
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

1337
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:28,581
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1338
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,752
Now you sound like you.

1339
01:34:33,419 --> 01:34:34,920
But you don't.

1340
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:39,967
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1341
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:44,805
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1342
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,559
What did Loki do to you?

1343
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:51,729
He didn't. I just...

1344
01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:56,984
Natasha.

1345
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:01,113
I've been compromised.

1346
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:06,035
I got red in my ledger.

1347
01:35:08,371 --> 01:35:10,498
I would like to wipe it out.

1348
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:28,057
Was he married?

1349
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,558
No.

1350
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:33,938
There was a cellist, I think.

1351
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:36,941
I'm sorry.

1352
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:39,026
He seemed like a good man.

1353
01:35:40,528 --> 01:35:41,695
He was an idiot.

1354
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,864
Why? For believing?

1355
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:45,574
For taking on Loki alone.

1356
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:47,410
He was doing his job.

1357
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:49,829
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

1358
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:50,996
He should have...

1359
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,832
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1360
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,251
Right, I've heard that before.

1361
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:56,502
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1362
01:35:56,836 --> 01:35:58,462
We are not soldiers.

1363
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,760
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1364
01:36:05,052 --> 01:36:06,262
Neither am I.

1365
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:08,597
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

1366
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:10,099
But right now, we got to put that behind us

1367
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:12,184
and get this done.

1368
01:36:12,393 --> 01:36:13,394
Loki needs a power source.

1369
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:14,437
If we can put together a list...

1370
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,521
He made it personal.

1371
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:16,856
That's not the point.

1372
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:19,442
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1373
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,318
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1374
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:22,736
To tear us apart.

1375
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:24,697
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1376
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,283
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

1377
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:28,951
That's what he wants.

1378
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:31,287
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

1379
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:32,538
He wants an audience.

1380
01:36:33,539 --> 01:36:35,207
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1381
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:38,294
Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night.

1382
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,963
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1383
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,631
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1384
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:46,218
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

1385
01:36:48,262 --> 01:36:49,555
Son of a bitch!

1386
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:01,525
Time to go.

1387
01:37:01,984 --> 01:37:03,486
- Go where?  - I'll tell you on the way.

1388
01:37:03,736 --> 01:37:04,695
Can you fly one of those jets?

1389
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,531
I can.

1390
01:37:11,285 --> 01:37:12,411
You got a suit?

1391
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,621
Yeah.

1392
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:15,164
Then suit up.

1393
01:37:42,775 --> 01:37:44,151
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

1394
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:46,445
Son, just don't.

1395
01:37:48,948 --> 01:37:49,907
Sir.

1396
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,991
Agent Hill.

1397
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,327
Those cards,

1398
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:59,458
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

1399
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:05,589
They needed the push.

1400
01:38:08,968 --> 01:38:11,136
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

1401
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,264
They found him.

1402
01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:18,060
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

1403
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:20,271
- I want eyes on everything.  - Yes, Sir.

1404
01:38:33,993 --> 01:38:35,744
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1405
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:39,707
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1406
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:42,001
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.

1407
01:38:42,293 --> 01:38:43,586
It's too late!

1408
01:38:45,713 --> 01:38:47,214
She can't stop now.

1409
01:38:48,507 --> 01:38:50,593
She wants to show us something!

1410
01:38:50,843 --> 01:38:52,970
A new universe.

1411
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,388
Okay.

1412
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:03,772
The barrier is pure energy.

1413
01:39:03,856 --> 01:39:05,482
It's unbreachable.

1414
01:39:05,816 --> 01:39:07,651
Yeah, I got that.

1415
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:09,570
Plan B.

1416
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:13,115
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1417
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:15,284
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

1418
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,931
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

1419
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:41,518
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1420
01:39:41,685 --> 01:39:43,145
You should have left your armour on for that.

1421
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,897
Yeah.

1422
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,148
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1423
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:48,442
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1424
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:51,737
Would you like a drink?

1425
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,030
Stalling me won't change anything.

1426
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,491
No, no. Threatening.

1427
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:56,659
No drink? Are you sure?

1428
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:58,619
I'm having one.

1429
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:03,582
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

1430
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,542
What have I to fear?

1431
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:07,419
The Avengers.

1432
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:12,132
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

1433
01:40:12,216 --> 01:40:13,884
"Earth's mightiest heroes" type thing.

1434
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,552
Yes, I've met them.

1435
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:16,845
Yeah.

1436
01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:18,347
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1437
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:19,515
I'll give you that one.

1438
01:40:19,598 --> 01:40:21,809
But let's do a head count, here.

1439
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:24,436
Your brother, the demigod,

1440
01:40:26,105 --> 01:40:29,525
a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

1441
01:40:29,817 --> 01:40:33,028
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

1442
01:40:33,112 --> 01:40:36,031
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

1443
01:40:36,824 --> 01:40:39,493
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1444
01:40:39,576 --> 01:40:40,619
That was the plan.

1445
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,080
Not a great plan.

1446
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,249
When they come,

1447
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:46,834
and they will,

1448
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:48,043
they'll come for you.

1449
01:40:48,127 --> 01:40:49,169
I have an army.

1450
01:40:49,253 --> 01:40:50,337
We have a Hulk.

1451
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,506
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1452
01:40:52,589 --> 01:40:54,550
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

1453
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:58,429
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

1454
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:00,764
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

1455
01:41:00,973 --> 01:41:02,975
but it's all on you.

1456
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:05,144
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1457
01:41:05,269 --> 01:41:08,230
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1458
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:13,527
How will your friends have time for me

1459
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,195
when they are so busy fighting you?

1460
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:23,662
This usually works.

1461
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:26,623
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

1462
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,625
One out of five...

1463
01:41:30,335 --> 01:41:33,338
Jarvis, anytime now.

1464
01:41:35,007 --> 01:41:37,801
You will all fall before me.

1465
01:41:37,885 --> 01:41:39,136
Deploy!

1466
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:40,512
Deploy!

1467
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,043
And there's one other person you pissed off.

1468
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:13,212
His name was Phil.

1469
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:38,654
Right.

1470
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:39,738
Army.

1471
01:43:52,352 --> 01:43:53,729
Loki!

1472
01:43:53,812 --> 01:43:55,564
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1473
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:56,773
You can't.

1474
01:43:56,899 --> 01:43:58,817
There is no stopping it.

1475
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:00,652
There is only

1476
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:01,987
the war.

1477
01:44:02,154 --> 01:44:03,280
So be it.

1478
01:44:25,177 --> 01:44:27,129
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

1479
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:29,181
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1480
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,016
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

1481
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:50,786
Sir, we have more incoming.

1482
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:52,371
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1483
01:44:59,503 --> 01:45:01,046
- Nat?  - I see him.

1484
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:47,968
We got to get back up there.

1485
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:40,729
Stark, are you seeing this?

1486
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:43,857
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1487
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:45,525
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

1488
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,735
Banner?

1489
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:47,819
Just keep me posted.

1490
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:50,572
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1491
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:54,743
Look at this!

1492
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:55,827
Look around you!

1493
01:46:57,162 --> 01:47:00,665
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1494
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:02,667
It's too late.

1495
01:47:04,169 --> 01:47:05,420
It's too late to stop it.

1496
01:47:05,504 --> 01:47:09,049
No. We can, together.

1497
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:17,766
Sentiment.

1498
01:47:46,002 --> 01:47:48,255
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1499
01:47:49,256 --> 01:47:50,257
Loki.

1500
01:48:01,852 --> 01:48:03,645
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1501
01:48:09,276 --> 01:48:11,278
We got this. It's good. Go.

1502
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:12,571
Do you think you can hold them off?

1503
01:48:12,654 --> 01:48:13,697
Captain,

1504
01:48:15,866 --> 01:48:18,535
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1505
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:47,022
Just like Budapest all over again.

1506
01:48:47,898 --> 01:48:50,108
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1507
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:07,584
It's going to be an hour

1508
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:09,044
before they can scramble the National Guard.

1509
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:10,962
National Guard?

1510
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:13,173
Does the army know what's happening here?

1511
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:14,257
Do we?

1512
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,052
You need men in these buildings.

1513
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:18,678
There are people inside and they're going to be running

1514
01:49:18,762 --> 01:49:20,013
right into the line of fire.

1515
01:49:20,138 --> 01:49:22,057
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

1516
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,767
You keep them off the streets.

1517
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:26,144
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1518
01:49:26,603 --> 01:49:27,979
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1519
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:43,536
I need men in those buildings.

1520
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,747
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

1521
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:48,166
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

1522
01:49:58,802 --> 01:50:00,178
Well, we got its attention.

1523
01:50:00,512 --> 01:50:02,430
What the hell was step two?

1524
01:50:31,918 --> 01:50:32,961
What's the story upstairs?

1525
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,005
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

1526
01:50:35,088 --> 01:50:37,757
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

1527
01:50:37,841 --> 01:50:39,509
- How do we do this?  - As a team.

1528
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:40,719
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1529
01:50:41,136 --> 01:50:42,178
Yeah? Get in line.

1530
01:50:42,262 --> 01:50:43,263
Save it.

1531
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,140
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

1532
01:50:45,223 --> 01:50:46,266
and that's what we need.

1533
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:48,059
Without him, these things could run wild.

1534
01:50:48,143 --> 01:50:50,729
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

1535
01:50:58,445 --> 01:51:02,032
So, this all seems horrible.

1536
01:51:02,532 --> 01:51:03,658
I've seen worse.

1537
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,160
Sorry.

1538
01:51:05,368 --> 01:51:07,871
No, we could use a little worse.

1539
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,415
- Stark, we got him.  - Banner?

1540
01:51:10,623 --> 01:51:11,916
Just like you said.

1541
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,836
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1542
01:51:21,426 --> 01:51:23,178
I don't see how that's a party.

1543
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,062
Dr Banner.

1544
01:51:33,897 --> 01:51:35,732
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

1545
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:39,110
That's my secret, Captain.

1546
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:42,113
I'm always angry.

1547
01:51:53,792 --> 01:51:55,210
Hold on!

1548
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:26,699
Send the rest.

1549
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:34,749
Guys.

1550
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,251
Call it, Captain.

1551
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:37,585
All right, listen up.

1552
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:40,171
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

1553
01:52:40,547 --> 01:52:41,923
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1554
01:52:42,006 --> 01:52:43,925
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1555
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:45,093
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1556
01:52:45,176 --> 01:52:46,428
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

1557
01:52:46,553 --> 01:52:48,179
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1558
01:52:48,513 --> 01:52:49,556
- Can you give me a lift?  - Right.

1559
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:50,765
Better clench up, Legolas.

1560
01:52:54,519 --> 01:52:56,521
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

1561
01:52:56,855 --> 01:52:57,981
Slow them down.

1562
01:52:58,273 --> 01:53:00,150
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

1563
01:53:02,735 --> 01:53:04,028
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

1564
01:53:04,112 --> 01:53:05,280
We keep the fighting here.

1565
01:53:05,363 --> 01:53:06,364
And Hulk...

1566
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,160
Smash.

1567
01:54:04,088 --> 01:54:05,215
Sir.

1568
01:54:05,965 --> 01:54:06,966
The Council is on.

1569
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,141
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1570
01:54:17,185 --> 01:54:19,062
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

1571
01:54:19,354 --> 01:54:21,314
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1572
01:54:21,397 --> 01:54:22,607
So find a tight corner.

1573
01:54:22,815 --> 01:54:24,234
I will roger that.

1574
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,299
Oh, boy.

1575
01:54:55,515 --> 01:54:57,183
Nice call.

1576
01:54:57,267 --> 01:54:58,518
What else you got?

1577
01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:01,437
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

1578
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:03,481
And he didn't invite me.

1579
01:55:43,229 --> 01:55:45,231
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

1580
01:55:45,315 --> 01:55:46,274
if we don't close that portal.

1581
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:47,609
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1582
01:55:47,984 --> 01:55:50,278
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1583
01:55:52,322 --> 01:55:54,073
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

1584
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:56,242
I got a ride.

1585
01:55:57,327 --> 01:55:58,369
I could use a boost, though.

1586
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:02,040
Are you sure about this?

1587
01:56:02,707 --> 01:56:05,043
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1588
01:56:32,236 --> 01:56:34,030
Okay, turn, turn.

1589
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:36,032
Less! Less!

1590
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:01,659
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1591
01:58:01,743 --> 01:58:03,578
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

1592
01:58:03,661 --> 01:58:05,413
I'm on it.

1593
01:58:25,683 --> 01:58:27,351
Everyone! Clear out!

1594
01:58:57,381 --> 01:58:59,091
Director Fury,

1595
01:58:59,175 --> 01:59:00,718
the Council has made a decision.

1596
01:59:01,052 --> 01:59:03,846
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

1597
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:05,598
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1598
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:07,141
I have elected to ignore it.

1599
01:59:07,225 --> 01:59:10,311
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

1600
01:59:10,394 --> 01:59:11,437
You scramble that jet...

1601
01:59:11,562 --> 01:59:14,357
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1602
01:59:14,607 --> 01:59:16,776
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1603
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:18,861
I will not order a nuclear strike

1604
01:59:18,945 --> 01:59:20,279
against a civilian population.

1605
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:22,740
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

1606
01:59:23,074 --> 01:59:25,827
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1607
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:30,915
You.

1608
01:59:33,543 --> 01:59:34,752
Hawkeye!

1609
01:59:35,837 --> 01:59:36,838
Nat, what are you doing?

1610
01:59:37,797 --> 01:59:38,798
A little help?

1611
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,221
I got him.

1612
02:00:11,664 --> 02:00:12,665
Enough!

1613
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:15,501
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1614
02:00:15,835 --> 02:00:18,671
I am a god, you dull creature.

1615
02:00:18,754 --> 02:00:20,298
And I will not be bullied by...

1616
02:00:29,807 --> 02:00:31,726
Puny god.

1617
02:00:40,067 --> 02:00:41,611
The sceptre...

1618
02:00:42,695 --> 02:00:43,988
Doctor.

1619
02:00:45,823 --> 02:00:48,701
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1620
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,453
The Tesseract can't fight,

1621
02:00:50,536 --> 02:00:52,371
but you can't protect against yourself.

1622
02:00:52,538 --> 02:00:53,581
It's not your fault.

1623
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:54,749
You didn't know what you were doing.

1624
02:00:58,169 --> 02:01:00,379
Actually, I think I did.

1625
02:01:00,463 --> 02:01:03,466
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

1626
02:01:04,592 --> 02:01:06,093
Loki's sceptre.

1627
02:01:06,177 --> 02:01:08,804
It may be able to close the portal.

1628
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,683
And I'm looking right at it.

1629
02:01:25,154 --> 02:01:28,658
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

1630
02:01:35,456 --> 02:01:38,793
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1631
02:01:38,876 --> 02:01:41,045
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1632
02:02:50,865 --> 02:02:52,700
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1633
02:02:52,783 --> 02:02:54,869
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1634
02:02:54,952 --> 02:02:57,413
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

1635
02:02:58,456 --> 02:03:00,458
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1636
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,793
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

1637
02:03:03,127 --> 02:03:04,462
We need to shut it down!

1638
02:03:04,545 --> 02:03:06,547
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1639
02:03:37,328 --> 02:03:39,538
Stark, do you hear me?

1640
02:03:39,622 --> 02:03:41,582
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

1641
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:43,709
How long?

1642
02:03:43,793 --> 02:03:45,920
Three minutes, max.

1643
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:47,463
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1644
02:03:47,713 --> 02:03:49,590
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

1645
02:03:49,882 --> 02:03:51,592
I just did.

1646
02:04:04,313 --> 02:04:05,689
Package is sent.

1647
02:04:05,898 --> 02:04:08,859
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1648
02:04:31,799 --> 02:04:34,218
Are you ready for another bout?

1649
02:04:34,677 --> 02:04:35,719
What, are you getting sleepy?

1650
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:43,269
Right at the crown!

1651
02:04:49,233 --> 02:04:51,110
I can close it.

1652
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:52,903
Can anybody copy?

1653
02:04:53,028 --> 02:04:54,238
I can shut the portal down.

1654
02:04:54,572 --> 02:04:56,532
- Do it!  - No, wait.

1655
02:04:56,615 --> 02:04:57,825
Stark, these things are still coming.

1656
02:04:57,908 --> 02:04:58,909
I got a nuke coming in.

1657
02:04:58,993 --> 02:05:00,870
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1658
02:05:10,838 --> 02:05:12,506
And I know just where to put it.

1659
02:05:19,889 --> 02:05:22,266
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1660
02:05:22,349 --> 02:05:23,767
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1661
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:28,022
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1662
02:05:28,105 --> 02:05:29,857
Might as well.

1663
02:05:32,067 --> 02:05:34,486
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

1664
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:36,947
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

1665
02:05:37,156 --> 02:05:38,699
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1666
02:05:38,949 --> 02:05:41,285
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

1667
02:05:41,368 --> 02:05:44,121
I have never seen anything like this.

1668
02:05:44,455 --> 02:05:45,789
We have limited information on the team

1669
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:49,627
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1670
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,035
Come on, Stark.

1671
02:07:11,417 --> 02:07:12,584
Close it.

1672
02:07:32,688 --> 02:07:33,689
Son of a gun.

1673
02:07:38,569 --> 02:07:40,237
He's not slowing down.

1674
02:07:58,255 --> 02:07:59,548
Is he breathing?

1675
02:08:27,618 --> 02:08:28,827
What the hell?

1676
02:08:31,747 --> 02:08:33,916
What just happened?

1677
02:08:34,166 --> 02:08:36,293
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1678
02:08:40,547 --> 02:08:42,007
We won.

1679
02:08:44,551 --> 02:08:45,886
All right, yay!

1680
02:08:45,969 --> 02:08:48,013
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1681
02:08:48,097 --> 02:08:51,058
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

1682
02:08:52,059 --> 02:08:53,477
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1683
02:08:54,144 --> 02:08:56,271
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

1684
02:08:56,355 --> 02:08:58,107
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1685
02:08:58,649 --> 02:08:59,983
We're not finished yet.

1686
02:09:05,072 --> 02:09:06,990
And then shawarma after.

1687
02:09:28,846 --> 02:09:31,181
If it's all the same to you,

1688
02:09:34,393 --> 02:09:36,103
I'll have that drink now.

1689
02:09:43,986 --> 02:09:46,029
Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed

1690
02:09:46,113 --> 02:09:47,906
as an extraterrestrial attack,

1691
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:49,533
the extraordinary heroics

1692
02:09:49,658 --> 02:09:51,618
of the group known as the Avengers

1693
02:09:51,702 --> 02:09:53,287
has been to many a cause not only for comfort,

1694
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:54,371
but for celebration.

1695
02:09:54,496 --> 02:09:56,957
It's just really great knowing they're out there.

1696
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,917
That someone is watching over us.

1697
02:09:59,001 --> 02:10:00,252
I love you, Thor!

1698
02:10:00,335 --> 02:10:02,087
And then these guys were like...

1699
02:10:02,171 --> 02:10:03,505
And then the air goes...

1700
02:10:03,589 --> 02:10:05,007
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1701
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:06,175
I don't know.

1702
02:10:06,258 --> 02:10:08,802
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

1703
02:10:08,886 --> 02:10:11,972
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

1704
02:10:12,055 --> 02:10:15,309
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

1705
02:10:15,601 --> 02:10:17,561
These so-called "heroes"

1706
02:10:17,644 --> 02:10:18,979
have to be held responsible

1707
02:10:19,062 --> 02:10:21,315
for the destruction done to this city.

1708
02:10:21,398 --> 02:10:23,525
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1709
02:10:23,609 --> 02:10:26,487
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

1710
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:27,654
Their sudden appearance

1711
02:10:27,738 --> 02:10:29,156
and equally sudden disappearance...

1712
02:10:29,239 --> 02:10:32,075
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1713
02:10:34,077 --> 02:10:37,247
Captain America saved my life.

1714
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:42,878
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

1715
02:10:42,961 --> 02:10:44,505
I would just. ..

1716
02:10:45,255 --> 02:10:47,591
I would want to say thank you.

1717
02:10:50,052 --> 02:10:51,595
Where are the Avengers?

1718
02:10:51,929 --> 02:10:54,097
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1719
02:10:54,181 --> 02:10:56,391
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1720
02:10:56,475 --> 02:10:58,101
And the Tesseract?

1721
02:10:58,185 --> 02:11:00,270
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1722
02:11:00,896 --> 02:11:03,273
Out of our reach.

1723
02:11:03,482 --> 02:11:04,900
That's not your call.

1724
02:11:04,983 --> 02:11:06,026
I didn't make it.

1725
02:11:06,151 --> 02:11:08,237
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1726
02:11:08,529 --> 02:11:10,197
So, you let him take it

1727
02:11:10,447 --> 02:11:12,115
and the war criminal, Loki,

1728
02:11:12,199 --> 02:11:13,992
who should be answering for his crime.

1729
02:11:14,076 --> 02:11:16,411
I think he Will be.

1730
02:11:30,133 --> 02:11:32,511
I don't think you understand what you've started,

1731
02:11:32,886 --> 02:11:35,180
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

1732
02:11:35,597 --> 02:11:36,640
They're dangerous.

1733
02:11:37,015 --> 02:11:40,519
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

1734
02:11:41,228 --> 02:11:43,564
Every world knows it.

1735
02:11:44,231 --> 02:11:46,191
Was that the point of all this?

1736
02:11:46,483 --> 02:11:48,026
A statement?

1737
02:11:50,904 --> 02:11:52,406
A promise.

1738
02:12:00,872 --> 02:12:02,457
Sir, how does it work now?

1739
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,794
They've gone their separate ways.

1740
02:12:05,877 --> 02:12:08,839
Some, pretty extremely far.

1741
02:12:09,548 --> 02:12:11,550
If we get into a situation like this again,

1742
02:12:11,633 --> 02:12:12,968
what happens then?

1743
02:12:13,051 --> 02:12:14,094
They'll come back.

1744
02:12:15,762 --> 02:12:17,264
Are you really sure about that?

1745
02:12:17,347 --> 02:12:18,348
I am.

1746
02:12:20,225 --> 02:12:21,518
Why?

1747
02:12:22,519 --> 02:12:24,396
Because we'll need them to.

1748
02:15:16,276 --> 02:15:18,820
Humans.

1749
02:15:20,030 --> 02:15:24,451
They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.

1750
02:15:25,368 --> 02:15:27,537
They stand.

1751
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:33,585
They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled.

1752
02:15:41,802 --> 02:15:44,721
To challenge them

1753
02:15:44,805 --> 02:15:48,183
is to court death.
