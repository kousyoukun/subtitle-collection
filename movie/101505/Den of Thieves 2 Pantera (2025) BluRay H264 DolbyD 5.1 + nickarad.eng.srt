1
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,718
Visibility, one.

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,471
Ceiling 4,000 overcast.
Temperature--

3
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,972
Salah 1-1-4 clear to land,

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,349
runway 1-1.

5
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,560
Clear to land Salah 1-1-4.

6
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,442
These streets,
they're different.

7
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,861
They're old.

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,323
The ties are deep and hidden.

9
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,702
It's where the East
claws at the West.

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,662
Where the South
seeks the North.

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,584
There's honor here
that must be respected.

12
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,088
Rules that cannot be broken.

13
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,008
And if a mistake is made...

14
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,097
Room service.

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,029
Shutting down engines.

16
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,907
Hey! What's the problem?

17
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,785
Apologies! Someone called in
a bomb threat.

18
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,245
This is a restricted area!

19
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,501
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!

20
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,877
On your knees!
Show me your hands!

21
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,128
On your knees.

22
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,172
Get on your fucking knees,
right now!

23
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,471
Lay down! Lay down!
Lay fucking down!

24
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,975
Lay down! Lay down
right now. Don't move!

25
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,851
Don't move! On me!

26
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,362
Hands, hands!
Show me your hands!

27
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,198
You, come out! Come out!
You, come out. On the ground!

28
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,157
Get down!

29
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,872
It's clear!

30
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,172
Dogs on the scent.

31
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,262
Package in hand.

32
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,264
Package in hand. Exiting.

33
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,349
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

34
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,225
Not bad!

35
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,330
If he catches us...
Faster, faster!

36
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,395
We good?

37
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,855
We clean. We clean. Still good.

38
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,703
In Belgium last night,

39
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,705
Salah Airline flight 114,

40
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,124
that was the Africa flight,
with the diamond industry

41
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,835
became the epicenter of a
meticulously executed heist

42
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,838
at the Antwerp International
Airport cargo terminal.

43
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,215
The incident unfolded

44
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,091
as the flight arrived
from Johannesburg,

45
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,010
and suspects
in police tactical gear

46
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,470
raced across the tarmac

47
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,722
to stage an assault
on the cargo hangar.

48
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,099
Preliminary reports suggest
that the thieves made away

49
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,976
with millions of dollars'
worth of diamonds.

50
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,312
Indications point
to the Panther mafia

51
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,690
as potential orchestrators
behind this meticulously
planned robbery.

52
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,541
My man crush, Deputy Nick.

53
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,042
Hey.

54
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,670
Did you hear about the diamond
rip at the airport? Belgium?

55
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,214
What, the Antwerp thing? Yeah.

56
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,882
Oh. So,
that's what this is about?

57
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
Mm-hmm.

58
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,054
Mm. Zero grams of sugar.

59
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,937
Lawman, afternoon.

60
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,856
Lieutenant, you're busy,
I'm busy.

61
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,316
So, let's jump to it, shall we?

62
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,656
Sir, I have reason to believe
my suspect is still operating.

63
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,907
And you know this how?

64
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,244
I just do.

65
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,663
-And what's your ask?
-Simple.

66
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,790
Issue a BOLO,
or at least a purple notice,

67
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,334
so I can continue
my investigation.

68
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,128
I can't operate outside of
CONUS without it.

69
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,089
Isn't this case closed by now?

70
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,636
Look. We've investigated
the incident ad nauseam.

71
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,430
And the issue here, Nick,
is this,

72
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,641
whether there was an actual
breach or not is debatable.

73
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,602
And we'd be pursuing it robustly

74
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,021
if there were abnormalities
with any of the accounts.

75
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,147
But there weren't.

76
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,774
Neither us,
nor any of our clients,

77
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,069
which translates to
every single goddamn bank

78
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,197
in the entire
American Southwest, and Guam,

79
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,991
and Hawaii,
are missing a dollar.

80
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,868
Not one.

81
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,954
Nothing was stolen, Nick.

82
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,997
I speak English.

83
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,084
The potential optics of this

84
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,046
are obviously
a nonstarter for us.

85
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,923
In no world can it be known
or leaked

86
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,843
that the Federal
fucking Reserve Bank

87
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,678
of the United States was robbed.

88
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,638
Not happening.

89
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,601
Go enjoy Lake Havasu, son.
I know you understand.

90
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,422
Backseat.

91
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,946
I trust you know how to use it.

92
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,534
Glock.

93
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,828
No safety.

94
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,705
No safety.

95
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,751
So, what's my cover?

96
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,337
You're French
of Cote d'Ivoire descent.

97
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,423
You're a diamond dealer
working out of London,

98
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,633
and we're EDM club promoters
here to promote the festival

99
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,885
for the next two weeks.
So, that's our clock.

100
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,731
Hope you got me a good view.

101
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,029
We'll meet the fence
this afternoon.

102
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,657
She's a sightholder and she
arranged office space for you.

103
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,951
And we've sanitized
the whole flat.

104
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,747
So, you're good to go.
Welcome to Nice, Jean-Jacques.

105
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,166
Here we go.

106
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,928
Jean-Jacques Dyallo.

107
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,718
What the fuck are you doing?

108
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,719
Follow him.

109
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,013
Follow that fucking car.

110
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,029
What are we doing?

111
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,117
Just relax.
You're gonna be fine.

112
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,425
Get out.

113
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,919
A stripper that doesn't smoke.

114
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,963
That's a first.

115
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,923
Go fuck yourself.

116
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,096
Still dealing bad food
at the club?

117
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,565
Okay.
Your dude told you everything.

118
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,566
Always do.

119
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,486
You knew about the Fed.

120
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,447
You always fuck your suspects?

121
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,616
Is that police procedure?

122
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,915
You know, I could close
these container doors

123
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,416
and then it'll be shipped
to China.

124
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,336
And when it gets there,

125
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,589
they'll open the doors
and there you'll be.

126
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,675
Dead.

127
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,094
A dead stripper in China.

128
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,679
Sounds kinky.

129
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,139
No, it doesn't.

130
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,268
We'll make this simple.

131
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,939
Since Merrimen's dead,
you're gonna tell me two things.

132
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,900
Where were he and Donnie going
that they didn't get to?

133
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,655
And what did they do
with the money?

134
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,884
Who's the lucky guy?

135
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,970
He was all prison weird.

136
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,472
He didn't fuck me.

137
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,725
You did.

138
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,019
And I can post this...

139
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,730
anytime.

140
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,608
God.
I look so much younger there.

141
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,780
I know where Donnie went.

142
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,326
I know where he put the money.
But I want my man's cut.

143
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,495
Seven million.

144
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,873
Or the LASD and your daughters

145
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,333
will be super proud
of your amateur porn career.

146
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,630
You understand, motherfucker?

147
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,557
Where is the money?

148
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,936
The Panama Diamant Bank.

149
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,814
Hey.

150
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,070
Jean-Jacques, this is
my lovely friend Chava.

151
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,029
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

152
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,206
...rusty.

153
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
Well, you have to speak English
in this business anyway, so...

154
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,046
You grow up in Abidjan or...

155
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,339
- Tengrela.
- Oh!

156
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,174
So, you're Baoule, ethnically.

157
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,551
Ethnically? Sinfra.

158
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,595
I'm impressed.

159
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,847
You know a lot
about the country.

160
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,182
I mean, I have a lot of friends

161
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,559
in this business
from West Africa.

162
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,061
Tough negotiators.

163
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,020
Who isn't?

164
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,482
So, Jean-Jacques,

165
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,360
you have something
you want me to look at?

166
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,402
I do.

167
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,716
-And you came across this...
-My family.

168
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,343
We do business in Botswana.

169
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,393
Go on.

170
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,394
Great.

171
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,729
I'll leave you guys to it.

172
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,404
Let's get you set up
at the Bourse.

173
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,165
Uh-huh.

174
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,184
Monsieur.

175
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,211
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

176
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,212
Bonjour.

177
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,221
...walking through the Bourse.

178
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,222
D'accord.

179
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,226
Keep an eye on him, yeah?

180
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,769
Oui.

181
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,283
May I see your inventory?

182
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,242
You may.

183
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,305
Your office.
Landline phone here.

184
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,558
Dial 3 for security,
7 for the Concierge,

185
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,934
and 8 to dial out.

186
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,227
Your safe.

187
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,354
You dial in your own
personal code here.

188
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,732
But you could leave it open,
to be honest.

189
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,985
You're in the most
secure building
in continental Europe.

190
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,194
I certainly hope so.

191
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,947
I have some inventory
coming in this week.

192
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,700
Is it possible to lease
one of the vault boxes?

193
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,535
Oh, I'm sorry, not possible.

194
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,996
Currently, all the vault boxes
are fully booked.

195
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,373
And they are reserved
for sightholders anyway.

196
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,458
Ah!

197
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,460
Hopefully, something opens up.

198
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,096
So?

199
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,098
We're in. But we have a problem.

200
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,808
There's no access to the vault.

201
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,227
Only sightholders in Dali
have access,

202
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,229
and there's
no security boxes available.

203
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,315
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

204
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,858
Just let me handle it.

205
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,136
You have an
account across the street?

206
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,097
Of course. What is the offer?

207
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,351
Well, these stones
obviously don't come
with Kimberley certificates.

208
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,894
4.2.

209
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,065
I...
I cannot go lower than five.

210
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,193
It is also the only offer
you will get, Jean-Jacques.

211
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,537
4.2.
Here's your cash.

212
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,831
I understand we have a Marsala.

213
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,057
-Afternoon, sunshine!
-I'm good. I'm good.

214
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,645
Are you actually
living in your car now?

215
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,438
-I love my car.
-Okay.

216
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,774
So,
one week before the Fed heist,

217
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,110
the account Hofbro Imports LLC

218
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,946
is opened at the Diamant Bank
in Panama City.

219
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,031
Thirty-three days after the Fed,

220
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,909
$22,127,000 are deposited.

221
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,453
-And then it goes dark
for a couple of years.
-Shit.

222
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,831
Except for
a few cash withdrawals
in London and Belgium.

223
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,958
Check the PDF I sent you
over Signal.

224
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,254
Two days after the diamond rip
in Antwerp,

225
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,339
there's a deposit of 4.2.

226
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,841
Since then,
it's a flurry of activity,

227
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:36,553
including 1.8 in cash
withdrawals dated yesterday.

228
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,138
Fenced the stones, then payouts.

229
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,806
Correct.

230
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,726
Now, there's only five locations
of the Diamant Bank worldwide.

231
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,314
Marseille, Dubai, Tel Aviv,
Panama City, and Nice, France.

232
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,316
Look at the map I sent you.

233
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,152
What is directly across
from the Nice branch?

234
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,278
Fuckin' A.

235
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,654
The World Diamond Centre.

236
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,990
Okay. Who's our POC
on the Antwerp job?

237
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,241
Check your JREC.

238
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,661
Task Force Pantera.
BRB Commander Hugo Kamen.

239
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,580
He'll be expecting your call.

240
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,916
I know you're not gonna kick
this up to Europol.
How are you gonna operate?

241
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,335
Good point. Hold on.

242
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,922
Global jurisdiction.
U.S. Marshal.

243
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,258
He was deputized
on the Chris Dorner manhunt.

244
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,761
We didn't know if that fucker
was in Temecula or Paraguay.

245
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,347
Okay, did you re-up?

246
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,225
No. Good point. So, uh,
you gotta back me up, okay?

247
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,311
If they call me out,
validate me.

248
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,063
-I can do that.
-Thank you.

249
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,564
Now, get the fuck out of my car.

250
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,191
All right.

251
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,875
- Comms are secure, so we can speak freely.
 Okay.

252
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,003
I am Cleopatra.

253
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,297
Now, I've been working with
each one of you individually,

254
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,299
but never as a group.

255
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,261
There's a reason
why you're all here.

256
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,638
This will be our biggest job
on the continent yet.

257
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,140
This isn't a smash and grab.

258
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,601
We're here to rob
the World Diamond Centre.

259
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,439
We estimate the score
to be 850 million euros.

260
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,860
Use these SIMs and only these
for all communication.

261
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,613
Vuk, logistics.
Marko, vehicles and transport.

262
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:05,785
Dragan, safes, entry.
Slavko, comms, cell overwatch.

263
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,829
Jean-Jacques.

264
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,622
He'll be doing
the recce and the planning.

265
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,255
That's what
the fuck I'm doing.

266
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,132
Okay, okay, guys.
Calm the fuck down, okay?

267
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,925
This guy is one of the best
thieves on the planet, okay?

268
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,051
What the fuck is your problem?

269
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,888
Yeah, it's fucking normal.

270
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,514
Wait! Hey, shut the fuck up!

271
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,480
Okay.
We have until the last Sunday
of the month to execute the job.

272
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,107
So, as we advance in our recce
to the target here,

273
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,652
the World Diamond Centre,

274
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,697
gathering all the intelligence
we need will be difficult.

275
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,741
Jean-Jacques is our asset
on the inside.

276
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,410
He finds our path to the vault.

277
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,747
And if you have a problem
with that,

278
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,832
you can get the fuck out now.

279
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,584
I'm good, boss.

280
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,253
What do you need?

281
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,131
I'll need brands, makes and
model of all security systems,

282
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,549
and of course, the vault.

283
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,551
Need to ID all their personnel.

284
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,094
Get to know
who we are dealing with,

285
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,846
and somehow, tap in their comms.

286
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,140
Confirm routes, find the exits.

287
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,600
I'll work up the routes.

288
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,311
I'll need to see them
before selecting vehicles.

289
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,104
-So, are we good?
-Yeah.

290
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,064
Ah, bravo.

291
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,272
Here we go.

292
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,236
France. Italy.

293
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,364
That bend, that is the border.

294
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,741
This is the alpine run.

295
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,452
No CCTV or plate readers
up on these roads?

296
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,955
Zero. All on the coast.

297
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,998
This is the route.

298
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,916
I need all-wheel drive.

299
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,669
Strip out the automation.
No anti-locks.

300
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,132
I'm sorry,
what was that?

301
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,341
Sir, yes, sir.

302
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,063
Excuse me.

303
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,232
Sorry.

304
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,360
Is the captain here? Capitaine?

305
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,695
Uh, oui, oui.

306
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,280
- No problem.
- Oh, okay.

307
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,824
We were set for, uh, 1:00,
1:00 p.m.

308
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,993
It's... it's... it's 1:30.

309
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,703
He's aware that I'm here or--

310
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,830
Nicholas. Hugo.

311
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,874
Welcome.

312
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,002
Nice to finally meet you.
I thought we said 1:00, but--

313
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:01,920
No.

314
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,755
Hmm.

315
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,132
Well, anyway,
I brought you some swag.

316
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,550
Thought you and the guys
might like it.

317
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,845
Oh.

318
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:15,350
I have LAPD
but not LASD. It's cool.

319
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,101
Do you want something
to eat, drink?

320
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,604
Coffee. Maybe a little one
of those croissants.

321
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,855
No, Nick.

322
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,441
It's croissant,
not, uh, croissant.

323
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,401
Well, clearly,
I don't speak French, right?

324
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,736
What American does?

325
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,279
This is Lieutenant Varane.
Lieutenant O'Brien.

326
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,364
Hey, nice to meet you.

327
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,039
Ah.

328
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,123
So, here they are.

329
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,375
Ah, oui.

330
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,794
It's very tough to crack.
Ethnically insular.

331
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,421
They work with the Italians
and Albanians once in a while,

332
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,048
but tactically,
they are brilliant.

333
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,591
The players are only aware

334
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,510
of who's in the cell
for a particular job.

335
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,512
So, if they get caught,
there's no one to rat on.

336
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,223
And tough to ID them.

337
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,183
We don't get much help
from Balkan Alley.

338
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,560
They are all like security
services and military.

339
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,521
They know
how to stay off the grid.

340
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,941
They often use women
who were models or athletes

341
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,818
who spend a lot of time
in Western Europe.

342
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,570
So, they have connections.
Know their way around.

343
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,240
This guy. Slobodan.

344
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,408
He's a criminal receiver.

345
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,159
He has deals
with the 'Ndrangheta

346
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,161
and all the top jewelers
in Italy.

347
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,872
He gives the green light for
every job on the continent.

348
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,543
We've been trying to bag him
for almost a decade.

349
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,294
Take a seat, Nick.

350
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,968
So, tell us about your suspect.

351
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,178
We have reason to believe,
thank you,

352
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,807
that he's operating out of
Europe, possibly France.

353
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,143
We started looking into it
after the Antwerp rip.

354
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,895
A lot of the signatures
of that job were similar

355
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,273
to some of the ones
we investigated in L.A.

356
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,735
But you know,
the Police Aeronautique

357
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,070
believe that most of them
were Balkan.

358
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,406
I thought you said that
they were all Balkan
except for one.

359
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,575
The one who recruited them.

360
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,910
Okay. And was he Black?

361
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,375
Okay.
 So, they weren't all Balkan is the point.

362
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,752
No.

363
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,381
Were you guys able to pull up
the surveillance footage
I requested?

364
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,549
Of course.

365
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,551
Okay.

366
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,429
Can I see it?

367
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,853
How's your croissant?

368
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,148
Great.

369
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,692
I'll make your life
a little bit easier
while you're over here.

370
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,320
You know, some of the letters
in French, they are silent.

371
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,656
Like the "T" in croissant,
for example.

372
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,494
You know, in American,
you say salmon, right?

373
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,788
But the "L" is silent, no?

374
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,040
Am I on Candid Camera
or something?

375
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,918
You know, I actually
say salmon. Always have.

376
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,171
Sal-mon. So, there you go.

377
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,131
He's a funny guy, huh?

378
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,467
Okay. This is from the day
you requested.

379
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,510
Let me know when to pause.

380
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,012
That's it. Diamant Bank.

381
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,437
Wait, wait, wait, stop.
Right there. Can you zoom in?

382
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,524
Try and find him
when he comes out.

383
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,736
Okay, just... Stop.

384
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,572
Okay. Inch forward.

385
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,869
Freeze. Freeze there.

386
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,663
Go in.

387
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,337
Allo, this him?

388
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,134
No, no. No, no. Not him.

389
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,344
No?

390
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,428
No.

391
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,440
If you need anything else,
you have my number.

392
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,401
Maybe we can go out
and have some salmon.

393
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,610
Thank you.

394
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,028
-French food kinda sucks.
-Oh.

395
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,576
Actually, Nick, it's the best.

396
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,038
But you American,
you have no taste.

397
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,179
I am.

398
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,116
Honey trap is set.
Check your Pegasus.

399
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,040
We got it.

400
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,907
Mademoiselle.

401
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,035
Grab a seat.

402
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,543
Come on, man, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

403
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,258
I won't bite. Promise.

404
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,285
So, what you packing there?

405
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,713
You don't have
any jurisdiction here.

406
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,632
Mm!

407
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,317
I didn't rob the Fed.

408
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,196
Who said anything about the Fed?

409
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,826
You know what I was
tripping on just now?

410
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,790
You and I are part of this
weird symbiosis.

411
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,003
See, you only exist, Fraulein,
because of me.

412
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,382
We weren't there
trying to stop you

413
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,801
from smuggling shit
and stealing shit,

414
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,388
then your shit wouldn't be
worth a fucking thing.

415
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,432
It's only worth the trouble,

416
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,935
because we're there
trying to stop you.

417
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,561
So, actually,
you need to thank me...

418
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,358
that your shit is worth
anything at all.

419
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,737
-You're welcome.
-Okay.

420
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,953
Cracks me up when people
pull guns on people.

421
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,415
Why don't you just shoot 'em?

422
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,424
You're not a killer. I am.

423
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,639
You got over on me, Fraulein.
No one gets over on me.

424
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,399
I'm broke.

425
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,944
And I'm sick of
being the hunter.

426
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,446
It's fucking exhausting.

427
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,576
Let's take a look at your view.

428
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,468
Word around the L.A. streets
is that they fired your ass.

429
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,223
So, how you gonna get in?

430
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,273
Take it.

431
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,699
I'm gonna ask you again.

432
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,285
How are you gonna get in there?

433
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,373
I'm working on it.

434
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,381
No, you can't trust me.

435
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,551
And yeah, I can haul your ass
in anytime I want.

436
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,303
Depends on my mood.

437
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,972
Right now, Fraulein,
it's pretty good.

438
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,437
You're gonna rob that place.
And I'm gonna do it with you.

439
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,442
I wanna meet these Panthers.

440
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,196
Set it up.

441
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,301
Fuck.

442
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,505
This is our city.
No one can hide from us here.

443
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,979
Jesus, that's strong!

444
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,743
That her?

445
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,705
Yeah, that's her.

446
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,124
I don't recall getting a memo
she was a supermodel.

447
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,062
Engleski? Yeah?

448
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,658
You've worked security?

449
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,534
Among other things.

450
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,703
How'd you guys meet?

451
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,788
Prison.

452
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,248
Gay cruise, actually.

453
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,301
Marlboro Man.

454
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,745
Yeah.
 But I mean, that's why I let them do the work for us.

455
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,206
I play the cops
like I play everyone else.

456
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,334
Right now,
he's our key to the vault.

457
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,794
No other option.

458
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,799
Invite him tonight.

459
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,219
We'll put him in a deep hole
and see if he crawls out.

460
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,600
Bonjour.

461
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,777
Sorry.
The wealthier they are,
the bigger the crook. Asshole.

462
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,155
Once you become
a slave to greed,

463
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,406
you're fucked.

464
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,866
Then I guess we are both fucked.

465
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,161
So, how can I help you?

466
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,371
I was wondering
if I can rent space

467
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,707
in one of your vault boxes
for a few weeks.

468
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,542
I have some inventory
coming in and I--

469
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,711
I do not like the idea
of keeping it in the office.

470
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,173
How much space exactly?

471
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,591
Around 3,000 karats.

472
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,553
Split the monthly cost
and we can do it.

473
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,679
Perfect.

474
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,765
Bon.

475
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,285
Show him.

476
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,771
That's the guy
who had the GPS beacon?

477
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,568
Text it to me.

478
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,697
- Okay.
- Good job.

479
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,822
- Yo!
- Hey!

480
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:49,950
You look good.

481
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,286
Holy shit.

482
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,287
Right?

483
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,082
So, these your new girlfriends?

484
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,210
Take it easy, man.
We're in no rush.

485
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,383
-Nick.
-Slavko.

486
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,676
Cool name. Pleasure.

487
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,720
-Dragan.
-Nick.

488
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,305
I know you.

489
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,182
Nick.

490
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,728
Take your time, bro.

491
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,273
Marko.

492
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,612
Have a seat.

493
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,284
Thank you.

494
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,708
Hey,
what's the name of that game?

495
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,961
You know, with the little
metal balls that you throw?

496
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,463
- Bocce.
- Bocce.

497
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:49,009
You know, at the cafe today.
I saw you guys there.

498
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,345
Your police academy
taught you well, Nicko.

499
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,348
Fuck the police.

500
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,807
Yeah, fuck the police.

501
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,105
-What is that?
-Sljivo.

502
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,983
-Say again?
-Sljivo. Sljivovica.

503
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,736
When you run out of gas,
you can put this in your car.

504
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,617
That's some nasty shit.

505
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,206
What is it?

506
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,248
Try it.

507
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,753
Cops don't do drugs.

508
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,255
So, do yourself a favor.

509
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,424
Stop being a pussy.
And hit that shit.

510
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,895
Holy shit.

511
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,238
Seriously. What are we...
what are we smoking?

512
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,115
Hashish.

513
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,324
With a little pixie dust.

514
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,701
Pixie, what?

515
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,620
E. You never try E?

516
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,122
Yeah, of course.

517
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:12,926
Okay.

518
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,415
I wish I could fucking dance!

519
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,256
Fuckin' Europe rules!

520
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,760
Hey, man,
sorry about bombing the shit

521
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,927
out of you guys in the '90s.

522
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,263
Now, that...
that was fucked up.

523
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,182
They killed my mother.

524
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,476
No, seriously?

525
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,895
We went to join the West,
but the West didn't want us.

526
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,438
So, we rob it.

527
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,273
I fucking love you guys.

528
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,733
-Fuck NATO!
-Fuck NATO!

529
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,276
-Fuck NATO!
-Fuck 'em!

530
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,277
Yeah, yeah, fuck NATO!

531
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,156
Oh, I got one coming up.

532
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,547
He's fucked up.

533
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:03,411
Hey. Not good.
Go to Nicko. Go, go.

534
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,454
You know I love you.

535
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,001
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

536
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,546
This is Marko's ex, man,
and he's trippin'.

537
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,756
Just slow it down
a little bit, all right?

538
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,304
- I told him.
- Yeah.

539
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,524
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

540
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,900
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

541
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,153
Fuck this shit.

542
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,155
-Hey.
-Hey.

543
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,158
Get your fucking hands
off me.

544
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,659
Fucking drama queen.
Let's go.

545
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,918
Hey, hey!

546
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,762
Fuck off!

547
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,183
Chill, chill.

548
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,226
What the fuck?

549
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,521
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

550
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,484
Why,
you wanna get smashed?

551
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,111
No. I don't wanna get smashed.

552
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,031
Hey! Hey!

553
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,493
Ah! We're really gonna
do this right now?

554
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,122
Oh, fuck. Shit, yeah.

555
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,665
Yeah,
big American tough guy.

556
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,668
You start shit in our country,
huh?

557
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,046
You think we're socialist
pussies over here, huh?

558
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,881
Yo, what the fuck
are you playing at?

559
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,633
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
I got one.

560
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,927
I'm really gonna
make you proud right now.

561
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,263
Croissant. Croissant.

562
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,891
You got it.
You don't like it?

563
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,976
Croiss-- Fuck! Croissant.

564
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,144
It's shit!

565
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,312
Come on.

566
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,897
I thought that was--
I thought that was good.

567
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,273
Donnie!

568
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,524
You fucking had my back.

569
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,527
Thank you.

570
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,157
Hey. Hey. Hey.

571
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,951
We got a fucking free ride?

572
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,285
This is a bad idea.

573
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,329
-Scooter time.
-This is bad.

574
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,705
Let's just press down
on the right.

575
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,415
Oh, shit.

576
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,792
Let's have some fucking fun
for once, man.

577
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,126
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah.

578
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,753
-Whoo-hoo!
-Oh, shit.

579
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,171
-Whoo!
-Oh, shit.

580
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,465
Fifty fucking miles an hour?

581
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,180
Get your slow ass
out of my way.

582
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,848
I thought white people
watched NASCAR.

583
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,975
You're my bitch.

584
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,686
-Whoo-hoo!
-Hey, hey!

585
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,523
What the fuck is wrong with you?

586
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,911
Oh, my God. That bitch.

587
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,288
Is that a horse?

588
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,541
Those are frogs.

589
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,300
Yeah. That's a cock.

590
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,634
Don't say it like that.

591
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,344
-Please call it a rooster.
-A rooster. Sorry.

592
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,806
I just fucking remembered.
I'm fucking starving.

593
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,683
I need water.

594
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,435
You like shawarma?

595
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,312
I don't know.

596
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,247
Hey.

597
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,584
How'd you find me?

598
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,629
I looked.

599
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,259
So, how'd you do it?

600
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,594
Do what?

601
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,096
Mm-mm.

602
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,017
The Fed isn't missing anything.

603
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,187
There you have it.

604
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:01,816
How the fuck does the Fed have
no idea it's been ripped off?

605
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,069
-How does that happen?
-You tell me.

606
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,491
You stole the old money
before it was shredded, huh?

607
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,327
- Huh?
- Unfit currency. Technically.

608
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,870
I read that somewhere.

609
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,497
I fucking knew it!

610
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,002
I fucking knew it.

611
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,714
Like, you gotta be fucking
loaded, right? Come on.

612
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,468
I don't know rich people,
but isn't it enough?

613
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,678
Then why don't you stop?
I... I... I don't get it.

614
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,639
I, uh, I can't.

615
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:34,974
You know where I'm from?

616
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,559
-Hawthorne.
-Mm-hmm.

617
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,978
-I know everything.
-Near Doty and Rosecrans.

618
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,313
With a Popeye in the corner

619
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,148
next to the Hawaiian
barbecue place.

620
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,275
I'd kill that
Hawaiian barbecue spread.

621
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,819
Right,
with a side of fried rice?

622
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,695
Yeah.
Pineapple chicken.

623
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,696
Fuck yeah!

624
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,293
My... my pops,

625
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,214
my pops was blasted

626
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,592
right in front of me
when I was six years old.

627
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,719
Some Pirus at Alondra Park.

628
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,472
My mom, she had to support us.

629
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,434
She was a server
at Marie Callender's
at the Del Amo mall.

630
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,727
She ain't make shit.

631
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,106
One year for Christmas,

632
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,027
all she could afford was a...
a Nerf hoop

633
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,990
that me and my sister
had to share.

634
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,117
That next year,
I was always good in school

635
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,120
and they moved me to this
magnet school in Torrance.

636
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,873
The only thing is I had
to walk to that motherfucker.

637
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,462
Three miles every day.

638
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,216
It was in a nice area.

639
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,261
So, the closer I got to school,

640
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,679
around that last mile,

641
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,559
I started to see the shift.
Nice, big houses.

642
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,311
Super clean yards.

643
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,063
So, I started to play
this little game in my mind.

644
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,108
I started to see patterns.

645
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,777
See if I could memorize
all the houses.

646
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,488
How many people lived in it.

647
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,491
If they would go to work,
and for how long.

648
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,661
When papers would start to
stack up on the front step.

649
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,247
Who had dogs, who didn't,
what type they were.

650
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,668
I had that neighborhood
clocked in no time.

651
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,467
So, Christmas is
coming back around,

652
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,096
and I feel my mama's anxiety.

653
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:43,770
Another fucking year
where she can't get us shit.

654
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,023
On my way to school,

655
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,443
I decided to look and see what
was in one of them houses.

656
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,780
It'll never be enough.

657
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,448
It's because
it's not about the money.

658
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,699
It's about the challenge.

659
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,119
Can I get in and get out

660
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,706
without anyone even knowing
I was there?

661
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,089
And I just started leveling up.

662
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,507
What you getting me
for Christmas?

663
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,467
A coupon to the Hofbrau.

664
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,511
I fucking love that place.

665
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,310
Seeing as we're in
couples therapy,

666
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:28,398
my old man owned a liquor
store right over there

667
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,900
off of Sepulveda Boulevard,
you know, near Western.

668
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,318
So, he used to walk to work.

669
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,736
One night, he was working late,

670
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:37,532
and these two dudes
rolled in with straps on.

671
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,618
Tried to rob him.

672
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,915
Now, he didn't take shit
from anybody ever.

673
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,544
And there was no way he was
gonna open that register.

674
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:54,007
He had this .38 that he kept
under the counter.

675
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:58,261
Yeah, right there.
And he looked down at it.

676
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,054
And these dudes
must have gotten spooked

677
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,639
that he was gonna
blast their ass,

678
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,766
because one asshole shot him.

679
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,102
Hmm.

680
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,813
Right there. Here.

681
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,483
Caught bit of leg
just below the hip.

682
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,570
And he survived.

683
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,115
But from that day on,
he had this fucking limp.

684
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,868
He had it to the day he died.
Never the same.

685
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,411
He put a brave face on, but...

686
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,209
I used to watch him walk
to work every day.

687
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,128
He would just put one foot
in front of the other.

688
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,631
With that fucking limp.

689
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,426
Broke my heart.

690
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,725
All I could think about
was getting the motherfuckers
that did it.

691
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,102
I never did. Never got 'em.

692
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,065
When I grew up, first chance
I got, I got a gun.

693
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,901
I got a badge.
And I started to hunt.

694
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,238
Fuck.

695
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,490
This time no one gets hurt.

696
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,327
Absolutely.

697
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,833
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! What?
-Whoa, whoa, hey.

698
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,168
- Keep walking.
- Okay, okay.

699
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,212
Keep walking. Let's go.

700
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,672
I didn't even call an Uber!

701
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,173
Fucking... Hey, hey, hey, hey!

702
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,591
Get in...
get in the fucking car!

703
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,823
A few weeks ago,

704
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:09,410
there was a flight
from Africa to Antwerp.

705
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:15,374
It had something on it.
Something that belongs to us.

706
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,794
To the Octopus.

707
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,466
And you stole it.

708
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,680
Get it back.

709
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,489
Hey!
Get the fuck back here!

710
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,826
Are you kidding me?

711
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,161
You stole diamonds
from the fucking mafia?

712
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,162
Like I fucking knew!

713
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,372
Oh, fuck!

714
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,337
Where are you going? Nick! Nick!

715
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,968
Take your shoes off.
You'll sink.

716
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,094
Shoes. Shoes.

717
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,602
Now, what?

718
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,272
What the fuck do you think?
Swim.

719
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,731
Swim? Where, Nick?

720
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,024
Oh, to Libya.

721
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,985
What the fuck do you think,
dum-dum? To shore!

722
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,987
I can't swim that fucking far.

723
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,614
I'm negatively buoyant.
Don't you know David Goggins?

724
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,578
-Don't be such a pussy.
-Fuck you!

725
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,121
You think there are
sharks around here?

726
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,706
Actually, yeah.
I think it's infested.

727
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,417
You kind of look like
shark food.

728
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,626
Stop talking to me.

729
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,383
I hate you!

730
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,801
I fucking hate you, too.

731
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,430
Fuck it. I'm out.

732
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,058
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What you mean?

733
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,269
I'm out. Capo di tutti i capi
or whatever the fuck it's called

734
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,396
is where I draw the line.

735
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,815
They go after families.
They don't give a fuck.

736
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,609
You can't do me like that.

737
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,653
All right,
I'm dead if you don't.

738
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,821
Well, you're the one that stole
the fucking diamond. I didn't.

739
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,536
You gonna bail on me.
You might as well arrest me.

740
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,538
Fuck it.

741
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,548
Don't fucking follow me.

742
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,841
You followed me here.

743
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,095
Dip out there, bitch.

744
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,648
How's the hangover,
mademoiselle?

745
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,026
You watching?

746
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,610
Yep.

747
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,114
Most guards don't do shit.

748
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,491
Smoke, dick around on phones,
watch porn.

749
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,412
-Those boys are different.
-Very.

750
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,580
Been clocking those dudes
for weeks.

751
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:23,914
Those dogs can hunt.

752
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,791
Yeah.

753
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,293
This is gonna be interesting.

754
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,171
You feeling it?

755
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,299
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

756
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,718
And the cop goes gangster.

757
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,347
Get your ass over here, man.
Your espresso's getting cold.

758
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,441
The WDC has no fire doors,

759
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,777
no emergency exit,
or egress point.

760
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,530
There's only one door.
One way in, one way out.

761
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,407
Any movements
within the district

762
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,076
will result in you
coming in a picture.

763
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,579
So, there's only one place
they're not looking.

764
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,665
Up.

765
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,377
Bravo. Dragan.

766
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,677
You're gonna
have to put this on.

767
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,514
These on sale
or something?

768
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,850
Where are my two boyfriends?

769
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,894
They're out.

770
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,278
Welcome.

771
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:55,297
Marko and Vuk went home.
You're a Panther now.

772
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,093
This is the entire theater.

773
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,846
We've recce'd every security
measure in the district.

774
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,807
As you can see,
there are no dead zones.

775
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,519
So, we'll have to create one.

776
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,814
There are 127 cameras
fed into central security

777
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,233
right here in this kiosk.

778
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,902
They only run ten CCTV monitors.

779
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,989
So, those 127 feeds

780
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,868
cycle through
at ten-second intervals.

781
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:29,165
At any given time,
117 of those views are dark.

782
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,835
We will perform a timed descent

783
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,796
that will move us undetected
through those dark zones

784
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,301
as a result of the CCTV
monitoring cycle.

785
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,304
What about the recorded footage
once the cameras are offline?

786
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,681
There's a WDC privacy law
that prevents it.

787
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,349
So, no footage
is being recorded.

788
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,101
It's just being viewed
in real time.

789
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:54,315
But we have a blind spot
and a problem.

790
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,401
So the only individuals
that are granted access
to the vault

791
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,862
is the Concierge,
the sightholders,

792
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:03,407
and their private security
who must be law enforcement.

793
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,244
We tried to flip
some internal assets
with access, but...

794
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,370
So, you're our way in.

795
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,789
Okay.

796
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,459
When does this happen?

797
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,627
Right now.

798
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:15,878
Like, right the fuck now.

799
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:27,598
No.

800
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,145
Mr. O'Brien has worked with me
for years.

801
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,732
I emailed admin
at your L.A. sheriff's office
for your bona fides,

802
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,025
but didn't receive anything.

803
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,110
You mean, uh...

804
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,238
You sure you got
the right email?

805
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,448
Maybe... maybe check.

806
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,492
Yeah.
I don't understand.

807
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,410
Oh!

808
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:50,246
Here we are. It went to my junk.

809
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,041
- Sorry for that.
- It happens.

810
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,169
Everything is okay.

811
01:10:58,545 --> 01:10:59,713
-Yeah. Mm.
-Wonderful.

812
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,639
Okay, man. She's on her way.

813
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,475
Just stand here?

814
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,143
Yeah.

815
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,854
-Bonjour.
-Ah, bonjour.

816
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,651
This is Nick,
my head of security.

817
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,694
Nick. Chava Falcone.

818
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:25,239
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

819
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,992
Ah, no francaise, huh?

820
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,078
By the way, the derby.
Nice-Monaco. Are you going?

821
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,538
-Olivier, the Concierge.
-Yeah.

822
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,124
Me, some friends. We're going
to a supporters' bar.

823
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,417
- Saturday?
- Yes.

824
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,752
-I might join you.
-Yeah, come. Come with us.

825
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,587
Merci.

826
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,966
So, Nick will go with you
to deposit the inventory.

827
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,384
Does tomorrow still work?

828
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,136
Yeah. But first thing
in the morning, eight o'clock,

829
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:48,887
because I'm slammed tomorrow.

830
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,389
- Sure.
- Thank you.

831
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:51,307
See you.

832
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,256
Why, bro? Why?

833
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,192
Hey!

834
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,402
For real gangster.

835
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,695
You watch your mouth.

836
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,657
This is why y'all
so amped up all the time.

837
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:52,743
Oh, my God.

838
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,540
Hey!

839
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:02,044
Now, this is music.

840
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:06,799
Okay.

841
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,884
Wow. Romantico.

842
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:10,886
Oh, my God.

843
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,389
Huh?

844
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,099
You gotta
make love more often, bro.

845
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,558
See, Dragan,
he's smooth with it.

846
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,686
Them glasses don't fool me.
I see you!

847
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:23,148
Yeah! Bro, you pent up.

848
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:29,696
Your suit. It's an ISR.
Records in every direction.

849
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,782
Oh. All right.

850
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,868
Sure this thing's gonna work?

851
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,996
I've worn these in 500
jewelry stores. They work.

852
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,082
Well, you're a woman.

853
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,960
They tend not to get frisked,
especially beautiful ones.

854
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,629
Well, neither do cops,
especially good ones.

855
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,757
I fuckin' hate suits.

856
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,259
Nothing good ever happens
in a suit.

857
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,561
That was fun the other night.

858
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,481
You know, at the club.

859
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:08,110
Yeah. Good DJ. Cool fight.

860
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:10,737
I just got divorced.

861
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:12,781
Oh, that's so sad.

862
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,119
And for the record,
I have no attraction to you.

863
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:21,165
Okay. You got any kids?

864
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,460
No.

865
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:30,340
Actually, yeah.

866
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,679
You know, I prefer honesty
rather than bullshit.

867
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,014
Oh.

868
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,183
Then, yeah, I do.
I got... I got two.

869
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,392
Damn!

870
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,145
I thought you were gonna
wife me up.

871
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,355
Can I change my answer?

872
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,823
Don't fuck this up.

873
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,080
And don't fuck me over.

874
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,385
Come on. Come on.

875
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,223
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

876
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,017
My detail.

877
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,393
We have an appointment
at the Bourse

878
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,978
with Miss Falcone
and the Concierge.

879
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,022
All right.

880
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,359
Merci.

881
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,075
You're good to go.

882
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,417
-Cam there.
-Cam.

883
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,552
Okay. Precious cargo.

884
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:00,222
Thank you so much, Chava.

885
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,975
I have to go
welcome parties. Come.

886
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,187
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

887
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,647
Good morning.

888
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:09,773
Morning.

889
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:10,816
Please.

890
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,286
The Concierge operates
the vault 24/7,

891
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,620
lives on the seventh floor,

892
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,914
escorts every appointment,
locks up every night.

893
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,624
Moving all this
with him anywhere

894
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,085
- near there would be...
- very risky.

895
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,837
Yeah. But we'll just time it
with his movements.

896
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,427
So, no more being sheriff
for you?

897
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,597
I tend to hurt
people's feelings.

898
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,974
Then you'll fit right in.

899
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,767
Huh.

900
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,576
Please.

901
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:06,622
-There's a thermal motion.
-Yeah.

902
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:08,332
- Can you turn around?
- I'm sorry.

903
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,835
There is the vault. Armon.

904
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,389
You can put the briefcase
on the desk, please.

905
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,287
The remaining issue is that

906
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:32,207
the security camera
from hallway to the foyer

907
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:33,500
is too high up for us to cover.

908
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,044
And that's the only camera
that doesn't cycle.

909
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,462
What if we cover ourselves?

910
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:38,714
Quantum Stealth?

911
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,717
Huh.

912
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:48,932
What we looking at?

913
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,183
I saw the stone.

914
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:53,937
Uh-huh.

915
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:55,897
Top left side.

916
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,399
Second row, fifth from the top.

917
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:01,528
I saw the fucking stone.

918
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,601
Good.

919
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:55,600
Nicholas.

920
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,898
You're enjoying your time off,
huh?

921
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:02,983
You know.

922
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:06,570
Beautiful family.

923
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,446
Oui.

924
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,493
Hey there.

925
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,412
I have to go.

926
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,221
I need to quit this shit, man.

927
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:18,808
I try pretty much
every fucking day.

928
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,106
So, how often do you get
to see 'em?

929
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,777
We try for a couple of times
a week, you know?

930
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:30,320
Wow. Mm.

931
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:33,573
That's fucking involved.

932
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:38,912
Are you the same?

933
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,707
I wish.

934
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,210
Christmas and birthdays only.

935
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:48,046
You know,
we go out into the world.

936
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,256
You know, we try to sort out
these problems.

937
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,761
But all we do is
we bring them home.

938
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,847
Yeah. It must really fucking
suck being married to a cop.

939
01:22:57,889 --> 01:22:58,932
Oui.

940
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,818
Be careful
of your new friends, huh?

941
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:12,195
I'll see you around, Lieutenant.

942
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,221
Low tech beats high tech.

943
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,018
Watch now.

944
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,025
Voila!

945
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:52,944
Fuck.

946
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,451
Not used to all the garlic
over here.

947
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,049
Now, you know,
turn around.

948
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,724
I guess he's making some sales.

949
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,620
Oh, is this ice cream?

950
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,082
Gelato.

951
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:49,000
It's fucking good.

952
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:50,293
Mm-hmm.

953
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,420
Yo, is that thermal?

954
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,547
- Huh?
- Is... Is that thermal?

955
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,091
Yeah.

956
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:43,596
Oui.

957
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,729
Concierge just left.

958
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:53,148
See you with the van
at egress point.

959
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,357
Copy.

960
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:58,273
Houdini One, this is Carbon Actual.
 Comms check.

961
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,691
Carbon Actual, copy.

962
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,025
Comms clear.

963
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,860
Houdini One moving on theater.

964
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:04,904
Copy that.

965
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,659
Houdini One in theater.

966
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,167
Houdini One,
you are red at Amstel.

967
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:48,169
Twenty seconds to green light.

968
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,420
Copy, Carbon Actual.

969
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:50,505
Standing by for green.

970
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:00,181
Ten seconds
to green light.

971
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,107
Five, four...

972
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,322
You're green. Green to Becks.

973
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,532
Green.

974
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,422
Copy, you're red at Becks.

975
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:35,007
Red at Becks.

976
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,885
Twelve seconds to green light.
Stand by.

977
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:40,012
Houdini One, holding at Becks.

978
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:45,142
Five, four, three...

979
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:11,752
Jesus, that's deep.

980
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:15,339
Yeah.

981
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,400
Fuckin' hell.

982
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,742
Eighty seconds to red.

983
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,368
Copy that, Carbon Actual.

984
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:00,968
Hmm.

985
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:04,472
Sixty seconds to red.

986
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:05,598
Come on.

987
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,565
Forty seconds to red.

988
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:19,362
Mm!

989
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,576
Twenty seconds to red.

990
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:38,297
Ten seconds to red.

991
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:46,013
Five, four, three, two, one.

992
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:48,057
Corona's red. Red at Corona.

993
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,108
Houdini One, location.

994
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:00,695
Houdini One
in Mineshaft at Diamond.

995
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:09,120
Houdini One, Quantum at Diamond.
Quantum at Diamond.

996
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,442
Holy shit.
Houdini in the mantle.

997
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:28,819
Copy.

998
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,674
It's not here.
It's not fucking here!

999
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,343
What do you mean,
it's not fucking here?

1000
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,055
Okay, just keep goin',
keep goin'.

1001
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:59,099
Please, turn this off! Gone!

1002
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,070
Fuck!
They're not here either.

1003
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:13,113
Come on, come on.

1004
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,672
What are you doing?

1005
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:31,548
No! Don't go. What?

1006
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:32,841
I'm sorry. Bye, guys.

1007
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:55,155
Fuck!

1008
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:57,157
Houdini One,
Housekeeper is home.

1009
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,742
Return to Mineshaft.

1010
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:00,828
Actual, what's that?

1011
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,124
Housekeeper is home.
Get the fuck out now!

1012
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:07,334
Fuck! We gotta go,
we gotta go!

1013
01:40:15,217 --> 01:40:16,343
- You see it?
- No.

1014
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:21,849
Shit, where is it?

1015
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,405
It's here. It's here.

1016
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:38,032
- We gotta go, Donnie.
- No, no, no.

1017
01:40:38,073 --> 01:40:39,450
- Hold on.
- We gotta go.

1018
01:40:39,491 --> 01:40:40,534
It's here.

1019
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,618
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1020
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,953
One more sec.

1021
01:40:42,995 --> 01:40:43,996
Donnie, Donnie.

1022
01:40:44,496 --> 01:40:45,748
Donnie, get up.

1023
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:46,957
- Come on! Come on!
- Wait!

1024
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:01,388
Donnie, just fucking leave it.
We gotta go now!

1025
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,265
- Jeez, hold on.
- Just get up!

1026
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,767
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

1027
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:05,768
Wait!

1028
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,645
Thank fucking God.

1029
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,289
Houdini One, come in.

1030
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:20,843
Houdini One
moving up the Mineshaft.

1031
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,720
Copy.

1032
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:53,667
Houdini One
holding at Corona.

1033
01:42:57,754 --> 01:42:59,173
You're green at Corona.

1034
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,057
140 seconds green at Corona.

1035
01:43:10,809 --> 01:43:12,060
Bags are secure.

1036
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,954
Sixty seconds at Corona.

1037
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:40,255
At Becks! At Becks!

1038
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:43,759
Hold at Becks.
Corona red in 45.

1039
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:54,978
Corona red in 30.

1040
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:57,481
Fuck.

1041
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:12,621
Hold at Becks. Corona red in 20.

1042
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:13,664
Becks red.

1043
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:18,710
Three seconds to switch route.
Hold for command.

1044
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:26,510
Becks green. Becks green.

1045
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:45,404
Carbon Actual,
we are clear.

1046
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,572
Okay.

1047
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:05,590
Oh, fuck.

1048
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:15,559
Shit!

1049
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:19,980
Nick! Nick!

1050
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:36,038
What the f...

1051
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,671
- Go, go, come on.
- Come on.

1052
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:45,922
Come on.

1053
01:45:45,964 --> 01:45:47,049
I'll check it out.

1054
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:55,891
Houdini One,
dogs on the scent. Vanish.

1055
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:57,934
- Fuck!
- Go, go, go.

1056
01:45:57,976 --> 01:45:59,978
- Come on.
- Come on, Nick.

1057
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,480
You got it.

1058
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:05,984
Yeah.

1059
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,987
- Throw the backpack.
- Oh, fuck!

1060
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:15,077
Okay, go. Go, go.

1061
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:16,495
The pole! The pole!

1062
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:20,290
Move, move, move. Move!

1063
01:46:20,332 --> 01:46:22,042
Carbon Actual,
is Becks green?

1064
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:24,378
Copy. Confirm
Houdini One, Becks green.

1065
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,310
Okay.

1066
01:46:40,352 --> 01:46:43,522
- So, I want you to clear
the atrium stairs, all right?

1067
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:45,607
And don't forget
to lock down
the fucking elevator, yeah?

1068
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:41,705
Roof clear.

1069
01:47:55,969 --> 01:47:58,889
Carbon Actual,
I need the location
of Houdini One.

1070
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:00,265
Location of Houdini One.

1071
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:32,756
What the fuck?

1072
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,517
Hands off weapon.
Just relax.

1073
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:47,812
Don't be stupid. All right?

1074
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:52,526
Don't be fucking stupid.

1075
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:57,030
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1076
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:04,955
What the fuck?

1077
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:09,125
Relax, relax.
I aimed center mass.

1078
01:49:13,922 --> 01:49:15,298
You're okay. All right?

1079
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,716
It's gonna hurt a few days,
though.

1080
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:19,010
Sorry about that.

1081
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:40,448
Stranger. Vanish. Northside.
Now, now, now!

1082
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:42,909
We got him. We got him.
Northside. Northside.

1083
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:43,910
Copy that.

1084
01:49:55,964 --> 01:49:56,923
It's him! It's him!

1085
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:03,054
Let's go, let's go!
We gotta go!

1086
01:50:08,059 --> 01:50:09,686
Ah, fuck!

1087
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:17,944
What the fuck?

1088
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:32,167
Shit. ANPR.

1089
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,133
If any of us get burned,

1090
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:23,635
Slobodan will put your cut away.

1091
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,805
And it'll be waiting for you
when you get out. Good luck.

1092
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:28,306
Focus.

1093
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:29,516
Good luck, brother.

1094
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:57,831
Watch our six.
Those aren't police headlights.

1095
01:54:03,586 --> 01:54:04,838
They're not friendly either.

1096
01:54:14,138 --> 01:54:15,098
Fuck.

1097
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:17,851
Mag.

1098
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:26,025
Drive. I shoot.
Call out, brakes.

1099
01:54:26,067 --> 01:54:26,985
Copy.

1100
01:54:30,154 --> 01:54:31,489
Shit. There's two of them.

1101
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,202
- Oh, God!
- Fuck!

1102
01:54:36,244 --> 01:54:37,370
Take the wheel! Wheel!

1103
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,210
- Hey! Move! Move!
- I'm good! I'm good!

1104
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:00,643
Mag change.

1105
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,111
I need a better shot.

1106
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:11,905
- Hold on! I can't hear you.
- Brake!

1107
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:29,088
Fuck! I'm fucking hit up, man!

1108
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:30,048
Hold on!

1109
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,685
-Mags change. You all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1110
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:51,277
Shit, still on us.

1111
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:52,528
- Can you loose 'em?
- Fucking trying.

1112
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:53,905
- Those dudes are drivers.
- Oh, shit.

1113
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:19,764
Shit! Fuck!

1114
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:21,808
Right this side.
I got a clean shot.

1115
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:22,767
Got you, break.

1116
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:36,197
I'm out. Mag change.

1117
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,240
I've got ammo.

1118
01:56:52,463 --> 01:56:53,423
Fuck this.

1119
01:57:07,103 --> 01:57:08,354
Fuck, yeah!

1120
01:57:17,613 --> 01:57:18,698
Okay, I'm out.

1121
01:57:30,918 --> 01:57:32,086
Fuck!

1122
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,171
Fuck!

1123
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:49,891
What the fuck was that?

1124
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:52,727
His fault.

1125
01:59:57,565 --> 01:59:58,983
That's it?

1126
02:01:04,674 --> 02:01:07,051
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

1127
02:01:10,846 --> 02:01:12,598
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

1128
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:14,433
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

1129
02:01:15,893 --> 02:01:17,937
- Slobodan.
- Jean-Jacques.

1130
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:19,522
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1131
02:01:19,563 --> 02:01:21,023
Slobodan, he is Nick.

1132
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,150
Sit down with us.

1133
02:01:23,192 --> 02:01:24,193
Take a seat, please.

1134
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,049
Ah!

1135
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:48,259
Yeah!

1136
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:49,552
Thank you.

1137
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,181
Signore.

1138
02:01:54,223 --> 02:01:55,891
Thank you.
Thank you.

1139
02:01:55,933 --> 02:01:57,268
Ah. You saved the town.

1140
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:59,478
-Huh?
-Okay, guys. Stand up, please.

1141
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:02,732
To heist of century.

1142
02:02:02,773 --> 02:02:03,858
And to the Panthers.

1143
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:10,906
Ah!

1144
02:02:16,871 --> 02:02:18,164
- You good?
- I'm good.

1145
02:02:30,509 --> 02:02:31,635
Oh, come on.

1146
02:02:31,677 --> 02:02:33,220
- Look at that.
- No!

1147
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:38,809
We saved this one,
we saved this one for you.

1148
02:02:38,851 --> 02:02:40,686
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Your style.

1149
02:02:40,728 --> 02:02:43,314
Hey. Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

1150
02:03:00,706 --> 02:03:02,124
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

1151
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:08,339
Okay, okay!

1152
02:03:10,007 --> 02:03:11,801
Don't move!

1153
02:03:11,842 --> 02:03:12,760
Hey, hey, hey!

1154
02:03:15,346 --> 02:03:17,223
Don't move, don't move!

1155
02:03:17,264 --> 02:03:19,141
Don't move! Hands back!

1156
02:03:25,564 --> 02:03:27,066
Hey! Hey!

1157
02:03:28,442 --> 02:03:29,735
Go! Go!

1158
02:03:29,777 --> 02:03:31,237
Move, move!

1159
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:34,323
Move!

1160
02:03:34,365 --> 02:03:35,533
Let's go!

1161
02:04:09,024 --> 02:04:10,860
You okay?

1162
02:04:10,901 --> 02:04:12,653
Yeah.

1163
02:04:13,863 --> 02:04:15,364
You want to do the honors?

1164
02:04:16,824 --> 02:04:19,410
You do it. Your jurisdiction.

1165
02:05:00,284 --> 02:05:04,455
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in the court of law.

1166
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:06,415
You have the right
to an attorney...

1167
02:05:18,427 --> 02:05:21,680
With these rights in mind,
do you wish to speak to me?

1168
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:33,984
Well played.

1169
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:36,403
I guess.

1170
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:40,658
Do you want something else?

1171
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:41,825
I'll have a croissant.

1172
02:05:45,162 --> 02:05:46,121
Parfait.

1173
02:05:49,875 --> 02:05:52,336
You know, you did the right
thing coming in, huh?

1174
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,051
It's strange, huh?

1175
02:06:00,553 --> 02:06:03,138
Living on the other side
feels good, no?

1176
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:08,519
Yeah.

1177
02:06:09,812 --> 02:06:11,105
Too good.

1178
02:06:17,319 --> 02:06:18,362
Respect.

1179
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,118
Time to go home, huh?

1180
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:27,913
To what?

1181
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:15,104
That was fun.

1182
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:21,443
So, we even?

1183
02:08:25,531 --> 02:08:27,866
Yeah. We're even.

1184
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:33,455
Feel good about yourself?

1185
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:40,421
Actually, no.

1186
02:08:40,462 --> 02:08:42,840
I thought I would feel
a little better, to be honest.

1187
02:08:46,885 --> 02:08:48,470
You're a piece of shit.

1188
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:02,735
I did save your life, though.

1189
02:09:04,945 --> 02:09:06,113
So, that was real?

1190
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,240
Yeah.

1191
02:09:09,616 --> 02:09:10,617
Yeah.

1192
02:09:12,035 --> 02:09:15,664
So, you've just been fuckin'
with me this whole time?

1193
02:09:20,502 --> 02:09:22,671
No. No. Not the whole time.

1194
02:09:25,174 --> 02:09:26,717
But at the end of the day,

1195
02:09:27,801 --> 02:09:30,012
a tiger just can't change
his stripes.

1196
02:09:31,805 --> 02:09:32,765
Just can't.

1197
02:09:39,188 --> 02:09:40,439
I'll see you, Fraulein.

1198
02:09:51,033 --> 02:09:52,117
By the way...

1199
02:09:53,952 --> 02:09:55,245
sit back left.

1200
02:11:42,269 --> 02:11:43,395
Back left!

1201
02:11:54,823 --> 02:11:55,908
Get ready to move.

1202
02:14:05,996 --> 02:14:07,873
Do we just get this
over with already?

1203
02:14:12,502 --> 02:14:13,754
No.

1204
02:14:32,814 --> 02:14:35,942
He says,
"Relax. Enjoy your beer."

1205
02:14:53,919 --> 02:14:57,047
He says that
if he wanted you gone,

1206
02:14:57,089 --> 02:14:59,633
that would have happened
a long time ago.

1207
02:15:04,721 --> 02:15:07,307
He wants to meet you.

1208
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:14,356
Because
he wanted to meet the man

1209
02:15:14,397 --> 02:15:16,233
who got his goods back.

1210
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:29,121
Because he wants to know
how the hell you did it.

1211
02:15:29,162 --> 02:15:34,167
You are Harry fucking Houdini!

1212
02:15:43,176 --> 02:15:48,098
And now, you work for me.

1213
02:15:58,942 --> 02:15:59,985
So, what's next?
