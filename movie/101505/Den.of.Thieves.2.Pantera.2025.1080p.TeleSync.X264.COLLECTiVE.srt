1
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,041
These streets, they're different.

2
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,458
They're old.

3
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,125
The ties are deep and hidden.

4
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,500
It's where the east claws at the west,

5
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,250
where the south seeks the north.

6
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,291
There's honor here
that must be respected,

7
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,916
rules that cannot be broken.

8
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,541
And if a mistake is made,

9
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:24,958


10
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,708
Room service.

11
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,750


12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,125


13
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,041


14
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:35,208


15
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,041


16
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,208


17
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,791


18
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,208
Hey! What's it rolling?

19
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,208
Apologies. Someone
caught in a bomb threat.

20
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,875
This is how to sit down here!

21
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,833
[gunshot]

22
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,958
[sirens]

23
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,791
Take off your knees!

24
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,208
On your knees!

25
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:02,625
Come here!

26
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:03,750
On your knees!

27
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,875
You do your fucking thing, don't move!

28
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:09,458
Lay down!

29
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,375
Lay down!

30
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,750
Lay fucking down!

31
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,791
Lay down!

32
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:14,291
Lay down!

33
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,666
Lay down right now!

34
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,166
Don't move!

35
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,208
Don't move!

36
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,208
Unmuse!

37
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,750
Hands, hands, show me your hands!

38
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,291
You, come out, come out!

39
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,875
You, come out on the ground!

40
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:32,500
Get down!

41
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:39,458
It's clear!

42
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,250
Delta-twit, Delta-twit.

43
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,208
We're leaving our vehicle to check-in.

44
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,625
We're leaving our vehicle to check-in.

45
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,375
We're leaving our vehicle to check-in.

46
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:19,583
Over.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,208
Copy.

48
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:20,833
On the right.

49
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:25,875
Team up, Pachner.

50
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,375
I got feet.

51
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,500
Dogs on the scent.

52
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,333
Clap, clap, clap!

53
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:32,875
Run, run!

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:33,583
Run, run!

55
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:33,916
Run, run!

56
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,500
Package in hand,
package in hand, exiting.

57
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:37,458
Use those hands.

58
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,083
You're starting, starting, starting, go!

59
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:39,958
That man!

60
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,291
Pachin.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,541
We're passing. Run in the
air, go make order, go make order.

62
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,458
If he catches us...

63
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,708
Badger, badger.

64
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,333


65
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,458


66
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,875


67
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:24,666
Are we good?

68
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:25,916
We're clean, we're clean.

69
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,041
Still good.

70
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:48,875


71
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,208
[water running]

72
00:07:44,208 --> 00:08:14,625
It felt good. at the Antwerp
International Airport cargo terminal.

73
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,500
The incident unfolded as the
flight arrived from Johannesburg and suspects,

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,958
in police tactical gear raced across the

75
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,291
tarmac to stage an
assault on the cargo hangar.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,666
Preliminary reports
suggest that the thieves

77
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,958
made away with millions
of dollars worth of diamonds

78
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,166
and occasions point to
the Panther Mafia, as potential

79
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,708
orchestrators behind
this meticulously planned robbery.

80
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,000
My man crush.

81
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:50,750
The Petit Nick.

82
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,250
Did you hear about the
diamond rip at the airport?

83
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:54,541
Belgium.

84
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,000
About the Antwerp thing?

85
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,750
Yeah.

86
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,708
Oh, so that's what this is about?

87
00:08:59,208 --> 00:08:59,750
Mm-hmm.

88
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:03,833
Zero grams of sugar.

89
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,500
[crunching]

90
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,208
Lawman, afternoon. Lieutenant, you're

91
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,416
busy. I'm busy. So
let's jump to it, shall we?

92
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,000
Sir, I have reason to
believe my suspect is still operating.

93
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,791
Then you know this how?

94
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:26,500
I just do.

95
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,541
And what's your ask?

96
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,291
Simple.

97
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,625
Issue a bolo, or at least a purple
notice, so I can continue my investigation.

98
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,708
I can't operate
outside of Kona's without it.

99
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,333
Isn't this case closed by now?

100
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,083
Look, we've investigated the incident ad

101
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,541
nauseam, and the
issue here, Nick, is this.

102
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,625
Whether there was an
actual breach or not is debatable.

103
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,250
And we'd be pursuing
it robustly if there were

104
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,958
abnormalities with any of
the accounts, but there weren't.

105
00:09:55,416 --> 00:10:01,208
Neither us, nor any of our clients,
which translates to every single goddamn bank

106
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:07,583
in the entire American Southwest and
Guam and Hawaii are missing a dollar. Not one.

107
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,750
Nothing was stolen, Nick.

108
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:11,875
I speak English.

109
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,625
The potential optics of
this are obviously a non-star for us.

110
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:23,083
In no world can it be
known or leaked that the Federal

111
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:27,541
fucking Reserve Bank of the
United States was robbed. Not happening.

112
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,541
Go enjoy Lake Havasu,
son. I know you understand.

113
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,500
Backseat.

114
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:18,750
I trust you know how to use it.

115
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:29,708
Clock.

116
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,375
No safety.

117
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,125
No safety.

118
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,541
So what's my cover?

119
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,041
Your French, of Cote d'Ivoire de Saint.

120
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,958
You're a diamond dealer working out of
London, and we're EDM club promoters here to

121
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,583
promote the
festival for the next two weeks.

122
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,208
So that's our clock.

123
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,541
Hope you got me a good view.

124
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,166
We'll meet defense this afternoon.

125
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,000
She's a sight
holder, and she arranged office

126
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,625
space for you. And
we've sanitized the whole flat.

127
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:13,916
So you're good to go.

128
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,791
Welcome to Nice. Jean-Jacques.

129
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:18,625
Here we go.

130
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:10,541
(suspenseful music)

131
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,833
Jean-Jacques Alors.

132
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:36,625
(suspenseful music)

133
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,375
What the fuck are you doing?

134
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,125
Follow him.

135
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,833
Follow that fucking car.

136
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:07,083
(suspenseful music)

137
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:12,458
What are we doing?

138
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,291
Just relax.

139
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:16,875
You're gonna be fine.

140
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,250
(suspenseful music)

141
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:32,625
Get out.

142
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,125
(suspenseful music)

143
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:04,708
(suspenseful music)

144
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,583
A stripper that doesn't smoke.

145
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:10,916
Am I the first?

146
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,541
Go fuck yourself.

147
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,541
Still dealing bad food at the club.

148
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:24,750
(suspenseful music)

149
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,166
Okay, your dude told
you everything, always do.

150
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:33,916
You knew about the Fed.

151
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,791
You always fuck your suspects?

152
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,125
Is that police procedure?

153
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,416
You know, I could
close these container doors

154
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,083
and it'll be shipped to China.

155
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,458
And when it gets
there, they'll open the doors

156
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,041
and there you'll be dead.

157
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,833
A dead stripper in China.

158
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,125
Sounds kinky.

159
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:02,708
No, it doesn't.

160
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,458
Make this simple.

161
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,625
Since Merryman's dead,
you're gonna tell me two things.

162
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,541
Where were he and Donnie
going that they didn't get to?

163
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,166
And what did they do with the money?

164
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:30,541
(suspenseful music)

165
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,250
Who's the lucky guy?

166
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,583
He was all prison weird.

167
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,875
He didn't fuck me.

168
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,875
You did.

169
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,541
And I can post this.

170
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,125
Anytime.

171
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,291
God, that looks so much younger there.

172
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,125
I knew where Donnie went.

173
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,916
I knew where he put the
money, but I want my man's cut.

174
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,291
7 million are the LASD and your daughters

175
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,000
will be super proud
of your amateur porn career.

176
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,916
You understand, motherfucker?

177
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,458
(suspenseful music)

178
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,208
Where is the money?

179
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,666
The Panama-Diamant Bank.

180
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:33,750
Hey.

181
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,708
Jean-Jacques, this
is my lovely friend, Hava.

182
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:40,458
Bonjour.

183
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,708
C'est bien compris vous et français?

184
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,250
Oui papa l'herme, français?

185
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,458
Je hommes pas pour français.

186
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,291
Je suis en pou, rusty.

187
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,250
Well, you have to speak
English in this business anyway, so.

188
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,375
You grow up in Abidjan or?

189
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,166
Sigella.

190
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,458
Oh, so you're Baulay, ethnically?

191
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,041
Ethnically, c'est n'faux.

192
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:04,750
I'm impressed.

193
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,416
You know a lot about the country.

194
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,416
I mean, I have a lot
of friends in his business

195
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,833
from West Africa, tough negotiators.

196
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,208
Who isn't?

197
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,625
So, Jean-Jacques.

198
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,916
You have something
you want me to look at?

199
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:20,541
I do.

200
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,083
And you came across this--

201
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:42,916
My family.

202
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,750
We do business in Botswana.

203
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:49,708
Hmm.

204
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:52,833
Come on.

205
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,541
Great.

206
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,500
I'll leave you guys to it.

207
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,208
Let's get you set up at the Bors.

208
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,291
Salut, legga.

209
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,375
Bonjour, monjour, monjour.

210
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,833
Cartier d'entités, se vous plaît?

211
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,208
M'am.

212
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,375
(people chattering)

213
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:26,125
Love ist.

214
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,375
(speaking in foreign language)

215
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,666
(dramatic music)

216
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,708
(dramatic music)

217
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,166
Bonjour, monjour.

218
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:01,250
Bonjour.

219
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,291
Le Nouveau, walking through the Bors.

220
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,250
Doctor.

221
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,833
Keep an eye on him, yeah?

222
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:16,666
We.

223
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,416
(dramatic music)

224
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:21,666
(speaking in foreign language)

225
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,083
Okay.

226
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,000
(speaking in foreign language)

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:37,000
(dramatic music)

228
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,000
Hey, salat, monjour.

229
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:39,750
Bonjour,

230
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,291
(speaking in foreign language)

231
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,625
I'm Salatie, vous vous vous plaît?

232
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,208
(dramatic music)

233
00:20:55,208 --> 00:21:00,708
(humming)

234
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:09,666
Et voilà.

235
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,458
May I see you on the bench, Oi?

236
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,291
You may.

237
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,833
(dramatic music)

238
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:22,625
D'accord.

239
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,291
(speaking in foreign language)

240
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,833
Et voilà, Monsieur D'Alou.

241
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,250
(speaking in foreign language)

242
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,083
Your office.

243
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,791
Lane line from here,

244
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,833
tile three for security,

245
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,458
seven for the concierge,

246
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,916
and eight to dial out.

247
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,000
You're safe.

248
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,666
You dial in your own personnel code here,

249
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,458
but you couldn't
leave it open, to be honest.

250
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,750
You in the most secure
building in continental Europe.

251
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,125
I certainly hope so.

252
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,541
I have some
inventory coming in this week.

253
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,166
Is it possible to
lease one of the vault boxes?

254
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,125
I'm sorry, not possible.

255
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,750
Currently, all the
vault boxes are fully booked,

256
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,166
and they are
reserved for site orders anyway.

257
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,750
Ah, hopefully something opens up.

258
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,250
Bonjourné.

259
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,916
Bonjourné.

260
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,583
(door creaking)

261
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,875
(sighing)

262
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:15,583
So?

263
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,291
We're in, but we have a problem.

264
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,250
There's no access to the vault.

265
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,291
Only site holders of L.E. have access,

266
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,583
and there's no security boxes available.

267
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,375
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

268
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,833
Just let me handle it.

269
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,875
(dramatic music)

270
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:49,708
(dog barking)

271
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:57,791
(door creaking)

272
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:38,750
(speaking in foreign language) (sighing)

273
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:10,541
(speaking in foreign language)

274
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,791
(speaking in foreign language)

275
00:24:56,791 --> 00:25:01,083
You have an account across the street?

276
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,041
Of course.

277
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:03,750
What is the offer?

278
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,166
Well, the stones obviously don't come

279
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,333
with Kimberly's certificates.

280
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,041
4.2.

281
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,125
I cannot go lower than five.

282
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:16,291
It is also the only
offer you will get, Jean-Jacques.

283
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,833
Hello, nous a bon finis.

284
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,750
4.2, here's your cash.

285
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,875
I understand we have a massage.

286
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,958
(paper rustling)

287
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:39,791
(door creaking)

288
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:44,666
(grunting)

289
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:45,708
Afternoon, sunshine.

290
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,333
I'm good, I'm good.

291
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,416
Are you actually living in your car now?

292
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:52,708
I love my car.

293
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,916
Okay, so one week before the Fed heist,

294
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,875
the account Hofbro Imports LLC is opened

295
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,500
at the Diamand Bank in Panama City.

296
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,750
33 days after the Fed,

297
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,750
$22,127,000 a deposit.

298
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,291
Then it goes dark for a couple years,

299
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,958
except for a few cash
withdrawals in London and Belgium.

300
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,083
Check the PDF I sent you over signal.

301
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,375
Two days after the
diamond rip in Antwerp,

302
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,083
that is a deposit of 4.2.

303
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,125
Since then it's a flurry of activity,

304
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,000
including 1.8 in cash withdrawals.

305
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,166
Dated yesterday.

306
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,250
Fence the stones then payouts.

307
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:26,958
Correct.

308
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,625
Now, there's only five locations

309
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,833
of the Diamand Bank worldwide.

310
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:35,291
Marseille, Dubai, Tel
Aviv, Panama City, and Nice, France.

311
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:36,833
Look at the map I sent you.

312
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,750
What is directly
across from the Nice branch?

313
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,083
Fucking A.

314
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:42,750
The World Diamond Center.

315
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,208
Okay, who's our POC on the Antwerp job?

316
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:45,833
Check your J-ring.

317
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,708
Task Force Pantera,
BRB Commander Hugo Cayman.

318
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,166
He'll be expecting your call.

319
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,500
I know you're not
gonna kick this up to Europol.

320
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,166
How are you gonna operate?

321
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:55,625
Good point, hold on.

322
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,458
Global jurisdiction, US Marshal.

323
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,000
I was deputized on
the Chris Dorner Manhattan.

324
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,958
We didn't know if that
fucker was a Temecula or Paraguay.

325
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,250
Okay, did you re-up?

326
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,041
No, good point.

327
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,416
So you gotta back me up, okay?

328
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,250
If they call me out, validate me.

329
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,250
I can do that.

330
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:16,041
Thank you.

331
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,500
Now get the fuck out of my car.

332
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:18,750
All right.

333
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,125
(tires squealing)

334
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:39,708
(tires squealing)

335
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:46,750
(tires squealing)

336
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,125
(tires squealing)

337
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,875
(tires squealing)

338
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,458
(dramatic music)

339
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,625
(door slamming)

340
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:15,000
(speaking in foreign language)

341
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,125
Como se hacer, quiero.

342
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,000
Someone can speak freely.

343
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:18,750
Okay.

344
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,250
I am Cleopatra.

345
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,916
Now I've been working
with each one of you individually,

346
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,333
but never as a group.

347
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,166
There's a reason why you're all here.

348
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,375
This will be our
biggest job on the continent yet.

349
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,833
This isn't a smash and grab.

350
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,500
We're here to rob
the World Diamond Center.

351
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,625
We estimate the
score to be 850 million euros.

352
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,708
Use these sims and only
these for all communication.

353
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,416
Vogue, logistics,
Marco, vehicles and transport,

354
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,666
dragga, safes, and tree.

355
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,458
Slavco, comes, sell Overwatch.

356
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:54,500
Coi, over.

357
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:55,791
Jean-Jacques.

358
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,208
He'll be doing the
recce and the planning.

359
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,250
(speaking in foreign language)

360
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,208
Okay, okay, guys,
calm the fuck down, okay?

361
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,208
This guy is one of the
best thieves on the planet, okay?

362
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,125
What the fuck is your problem?

363
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,208
(speaking in foreign language)
Yes, fucking normal.

364
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,750
Hey, shut the fuck up.

365
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,041
Okay, we have until
the last Sunday of the month

366
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,000
to execute the job.

367
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:24,000
So as we advance in
our reiki to the target here,

368
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:26,958
the World Diamond Center.

369
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,916
The ring of
intelligence we need will be difficult.

370
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,875
Jean-Jacques is our asset on the inside.

371
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,250
He finds our parts to the vault.

372
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,541
And if you have a problem with that,

373
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,750
you can get the fuck out now.

374
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,291
I'm good.

375
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:42,416
Pause.

376
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:44,250
What do you need?

377
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:45,458
I'll need brands,

378
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,750
makes a model of all security systems,

379
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,208
and of course, the vault.

380
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,875
Need to ID all their personnel.

381
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,666
Get to know who we are dealing with,

382
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,500
and somehow, tap in their comms.

383
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,416
Confirm routes, find the exits.

384
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:57,916
I'll work up the routes.

385
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,291
I'll need to see them
before selecting vehicles.

386
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,875
So are we good?

387
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:02,750
Yeah.

388
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:03,916
Oh, bravo.

389
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,666
(speaking in foreign language)

390
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:31,458
(speaking in foreign language)

391
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:39,333
(speaking in foreign language)

392
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,541
(people chattering)

393
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:44,500
Here we go.

394
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:48,500
France.

395
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:51,125
Italy.

396
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,083
That bends, that is the border.

397
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,208
This is the Alpine run.

398
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,000
No CCTV or plate
readers up on these roads?

399
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:00,000
Zero.

400
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:01,291
All on the coast.

401
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:02,583
This is the route.

402
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,125
I need all wheel
drive, strip out the automation.

403
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,458
No anti-locks.

404
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:08,791
(speaking in foreign language)

405
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:11,125
I'm sorry, what was that?

406
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:12,833
Sorry, yes sir.

407
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:18,250
(footsteps crunching)

408
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:26,708
Excuse me.

409
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:29,958
Sorry, is the captain here?

410
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:31,750
Captain Kane?

411
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,041
We've no problem.

412
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,541
Okay, we were set for one, 1 p.m.

413
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:39,291
It's 1.30.

414
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,458
He's aware that I'm here or--

415
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,958
(speaking in foreign language)

416
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,791
Nice to finally meet.

417
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,833
I thought we said one, but--

418
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,250
No.

419
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,750
Anyway, I brought you some swag.

420
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,250
Thought you and the guys might like it.

421
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,708
Oh, merci, mon porte.

422
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,166
Look at that super.

423
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,208
I have LAPD, but not LASD.

424
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,541
It's cool.

425
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,708
Do you want something to eat, drink?

426
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,083
Coffee, maybe a
little one of those croissants.

427
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,291
No, Nick.

428
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,333
It's croissant, not croissant.

429
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:12,958
Well, clearly I
don't speak French, right?

430
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,791
What American does.

431
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,208
This is Lieutenant
Taborin, Lieutenant Taborin.

432
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,250
Hey, nice to meet you.

433
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,750
(speaking in foreign language)

434
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,833
(sighs)

435
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,791
So here they are.

436
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:27,541
How are we?

437
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,416
It's very tough to
crack ethnically insular.

438
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,958
They work with the
Italians and Albanians once in a while,

439
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,500
but tactically they are brilliant.

440
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,041
The players are only
aware of who's in the cell

441
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,291
for a particular job.

442
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,166
So if they get
caught, there's no one to rat on.

443
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:40,583
What?

444
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,041
We don't have to ID them.

445
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,083
We don't get much help from Balkan Ali.

446
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,125
They are all
security services and military.

447
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,750
They know how to stay off the grid.

448
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,333
They often use women
who wear motels or athletes,

449
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,333
who spend a lot of
time in Western Europe.

450
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,666
So they have connections.

451
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,125
Now they're way around.

452
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,791
This guy, Slobodan.

453
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:00,958
He's a criminal receiver.

454
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,625
He has this with the Andragetta

455
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,750
and all the top jewelers in Italy.

456
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,500
He gives the green light
for every job on the continent.

457
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,041
We've been trying to
bag him for almost a decade.

458
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,083
Take a seat, plique.

459
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,833
So tell us about your suspect.

460
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,250
We have reason to believe, thank you,

461
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,208
that he's operating
out of Europe, possibly France.

462
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,833
We started looking
into it after the Antwerp rip.

463
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,916
A lot of the signatures of that job

464
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,750
were similar to some of
the ones we investigated in LA.

465
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,208
But you know, the police, Aaron O'Tik,

466
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,875
believes that most of them are Balkan.

467
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,458
I thought you said
that they were all Balkan,

468
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,000
except for one.

469
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:42,916
The one who recruited them.

470
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:43,791
Okay.

471
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,500
And was he black?

472
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:48,250
Where?

473
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,833
Okay, so they
weren't all Balkan, is the point.

474
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:53,041
No.

475
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,375
You guys able to pull
up the surveillance footage

476
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:57,833
I requested?

477
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:58,875
Of course.

478
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,791
Well, can I see it?

479
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,583
(clears throat)

480
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,250
How's your croissant?

481
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:13,750
Great.

482
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,625
I'll make your life a little bit easier

483
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,416
while you're over here.

484
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,625
You know, some of the
letters in French, they are silent.

485
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,250
Like the T in croissant, for example.

486
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,750
You know, in
America, you say salmon, right?

487
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,125
But the L is silent, no?

488
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,000
Am I on candid camera or something?

489
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,750
You know, I
actually say salmon, always half.

490
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:35,583
Salmon.

491
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,541
So ego.

492
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,875
It's a funny guy, huh?

493
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,500
Okay, this is from the day you requested.

494
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,166
Let me know when to post.

495
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,500
That's it, Diamon bank.

496
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,458
Wait, wait, wait, stop, right there.

497
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,041
Can you zoom in?

498
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,083
Try and find him when he comes out.

499
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:00,958
Okay, just stop.

500
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,916
Wait, inch forward.

501
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,041
Freeze, freeze there.

502
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:10,500
Go in.

503
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,166
Hello, this in?

504
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,333
No, no.

505
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,125
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

506
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:25,208
No?

507
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:26,333
No.

508
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:33,958
(dramatic music)

509
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:37,750
If you need
anything else, I have my number.

510
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,583
Maybe we can go out and have some salmon.

511
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,166
Thank you, but French food kind of sucks.

512
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:43,583
Oh.

513
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,750
Actually, Nick, it's the best.

514
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,333
But you're American, you have no taste.

515
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:54,708
It's on.

516
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:56,750
Yeah, it's nice.

517
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:57,750
Nice.

518
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,500
Watch your hand,
though, don't chop it off

519
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,250
to get that watch.

520
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,500
Don't chop it off.

521
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,041
(men chattering)

522
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:12,333
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

523
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:13,500
No, no, no.

524
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:15,833
Thank you.

525
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:21,583
Nice to see you.

526
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,916
(dramatic music)

527
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:41,625
(men chattering)

528
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,375
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

529
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,541
Plus, two.

530
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,000
I don't think you
even write in this town.

531
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:50,875
Oh, yeah?

532
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,333
My God, this is it.

533
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:07,166
(dramatic music)

534
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,833
Honey trap is set, check your Pegasus.

535
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,083
We got it.

536
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,833
(birds chirping)

537
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,750
(door creaking)

538
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:55,125
Mademoiselle.

539
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,083
Grab a seat.

540
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,125
Come on, man, sit down.

541
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,125
Make me nervous.

542
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,000
I won't bite, promise.

543
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:37,625
(footsteps thudding)

544
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:41,750
So what you packin' to her?

545
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:53,166
You don't have any jurisdiction here.

546
00:38:53,750 --> 00:39:05,625
(water splashing)

547
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:11,041
(sighs)

548
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,500
I didn't rob the Fed.

549
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,125
Who said anything about the Fed?

550
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,291
You know what I was trippin' on just now?

551
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:31,125
You and I are part
of this weird symbiosis.

552
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,708
Is that you only exist for a line.

553
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,458
Because of me.

554
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,458
We weren't there tryin' to stop you

555
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,208
from smugglin' shit and stealin' shit,

556
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,875
then your shit
wouldn't be worth the fuckin' thing.

557
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,333
It's only worth the trouble,

558
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,500
because we're there tryin' to stop you.

559
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,916
So actually, you need to thank me.

560
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,000
That your shit is worth anything at all.

561
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,041
You're welcome.

562
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,125
Okay.

563
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:06,875
Cracks me up.

564
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,333
When people pull guns on people,

565
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:11,916
why don't you just shoot them?

566
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,958
(gun firing) You're not a killer.

567
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:21,708
I am.

568
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,333
You got over on me for all that.

569
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,500
No one gets over on me.

570
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,208
I'm broke.

571
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,041
And I'm sick of bein' the hunter.

572
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,791
It's fuckin' exhausting.

573
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,250
Let's take a look at your view.

574
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:00,416
(footsteps)

575
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,625
Word around the LA
streets is that they fired your ass.

576
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,000
So how you gonna get in?

577
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:19,291
Take it.

578
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,708
(footsteps)

579
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:28,666
I'm gonna ask you again.

580
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,375
How are you gonna get in there?

581
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,291
Workin' on it.

582
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,791
No, you can't trust me.

583
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:47,083
And yeah, I can haul
your ass in anytime I want.

584
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,416
Depends on my mood right now, Fraulein.

585
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,041
It's pretty good.

586
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,416
You're gonna rob that place,

587
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,875
and I'm gonna do it with you.

588
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,250
I wanna meet these Panthers.

589
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:06,625
Set it up.

590
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,041
(crickets chirping)

591
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:28,666
Fuck.

592
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:36,333
(somber music)

593
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:47,041
(speaking in foreign language)

594
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,541
(speaking in foreign language)

595
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:04,375
This is our city.

596
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,291
No one can hide from us here.

597
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:10,208
(speaking in foreign language)

598
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:22,125
Jesus, that's strong.

599
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,000
(speaking in foreign language)

600
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:35,375
Is that her?

601
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,541
Yeah, that's her.

602
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,875
I'm gonna call gettin'
a memo she was a supermodel.

603
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:48,583
What will he?

604
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,791
(crickets chirping)

605
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,833
And Liski, yeah?

606
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,166
You've worked security?

607
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,166
Among other things.

608
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,208
How'd you guys meet?

609
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:20,250
Prison.

610
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:22,750
Gay crews, actually.

611
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,291
(crickets chirping)

612
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,250
(laughing)

613
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,625
Marlboro Man.

614
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,291
(somber music)

615
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:56,000
(speaking in foreign language)

616
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,750
(speaking in foreign language)

617
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,416
Yeah, but I mean, that's
why I let them do the work for us.

618
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,750
I play the cops
like I play everyone else.

619
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:06,583
(speaking in foreign language)
Right now is our key to the vault.

620
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,000
No other option.

621
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:10,416
(speaking in foreign language)

622
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:12,916
Invite him tonight.

623
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,625
We'll put him in a deep
hole and see if he cross out.

624
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:17,291
Lobo.

625
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,125
Lobo, bro.

626
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,833
(speaking in foreign language)

627
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:30,166
Sorry.

628
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:31,958
(speaking in foreign language)

629
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,750
Once you become a
slave to greed, you're fucked.

630
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,208
Then I guess we are both fucked.

631
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,000
(laughing) So, how can I help you?

632
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,083
I was wondering if I can rent space

633
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,916
in one of your
vault boxes for a few weeks.

634
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,958
I have some inventory coming in,

635
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,250
and I do not like the
idea of keeping it in the office.

636
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,333
How much space, exactly?

637
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,208
Around 3,000 cal.

638
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:59,625
Split the monthly cost and we can do it.

639
00:45:59,666 --> 00:45:59,875
Perfect.

640
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:01,500
What?

641
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:14,750
(people chattering)

642
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,833
(speaking in foreign language)

643
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:22,500
Shoom.

644
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:28,833
Do le moi?

645
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:41,541
(people chattering)

646
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,041
(speaking in foreign language)

647
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:50,750
That's the guy who had the GPS beacon.

648
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,833
(speaking in foreign language)

649
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:54,250
Sorry.

650
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,125
(speaking in foreign language)

651
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:58,583
Don't worry.

652
00:46:59,083 --> 00:46:59,333
Good.

653
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:00,500
Your job.

654
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:05,833
(people chattering)

655
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:07,250
Let's give up.

656
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:11,583
(people chattering)

657
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:14,333
(dramatic music)

658
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:38,583
(dramatic music)

659
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:40,708
Yo.

660
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:41,708
Hey.

661
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,250
Good, look good.

662
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:46,875
(laughing) Holy shit.

663
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:47,541
Right?

664
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,500
That could be crazy, you know.

665
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,625
So these your new girlfriends?

666
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,250
Take it easy, man.

667
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:54,958
We're in no rush.

668
00:47:59,375 --> 00:47:59,625
Nick.

669
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,541
Cool name, pleasure.

670
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:03,625
Dragon.

671
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:04,541
Nick.

672
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,416
I know you.

673
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:08,333
Nick.

674
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,166
Take your time, bro.

675
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:14,333
Marco.

676
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:15,625
Marco.

677
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:17,375
Nico.

678
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,291
(speaking in foreign language) Thank you.

679
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:29,458
(dramatic music)

680
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:34,250
Hey, what's the name of that game?

681
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,041
You know, with the
little metal balls that you throw?

682
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:38,250
Bocce.

683
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:39,125
Bocce.

684
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,791
You know, at the cafe today.

685
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,166
I saw you guys there.

686
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,875
Air Police Academy, Tokyo World, Nico.

687
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,125
Fuck the police.

688
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:49,916
(speaking in foreign language)

689
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:55,291
What is that?

690
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:56,750
Shleva.

691
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:57,333
Say again?

692
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,583
Shleva.

693
00:48:58,666 --> 00:48:59,333
Shleva vica.

694
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,375
When you run out of gas,
you can put this in your car.

695
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,333
Oh, some nasty shit.

696
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:13,416
What is it?

697
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:14,958
Try it.

698
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,416
Cops don't do drugs.

699
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,875
So do yourself a
favor, stop being a pussy,

700
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,000
and hit that shit.

701
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:30,791
(dramatic music)

702
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:36,541
Holy shit.

703
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,875
(laughing)

704
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,958
Seriously, what are we smoking?

705
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,375
Ashish.

706
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:49,250
With a little pixie dust.

707
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:50,125
What?

708
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:52,000
Eat.

709
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,375
You never try to eat?

710
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:54,333
Yeah, of course.

711
00:49:55,333 --> 00:50:05,833
(laughing)

712
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,708
(speaking in foreign language)

713
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:33,166
(dramatic music)

714
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,375
I wish I could fucking dance.

715
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:44,458
(laughing)

716
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,041
Hey, fucking Europe rules.

717
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:50,291
Hey, man, sorry about
bombing the shit out of you guys

718
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,125
in the 90s.

719
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,541
That was fucked up.

720
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:53,750
They came my mother.

721
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:56,166
No, seriously?

722
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:59,583
We went to join the
West, but the West didn't want us.

723
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:00,666
So we rob it.

724
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,500
I fucking love you guys.

725
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:03,541
Fuck NATO.

726
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:04,541
Fuck NATO.

727
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:05,500
Fuck NATO.

728
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:05,875
Fuck them.

729
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:06,958
Yeah, fuck NATO.

730
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,625
Oh, I got one coming up.

731
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:11,791
Hey.

732
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,333
(dramatic music)

733
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,250
He's fucked up.

734
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,250
(laughing)

735
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:52,250
(dramatic music)

736
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,291
Hey, no good.

737
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,708
Go to Nico, go, go.

738
00:51:59,333 --> 00:51:59,916
No, no.

739
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:06,750
Hey, this is
Marco's ex, man, and his trip.

740
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,541
Just slow it down
a little bit, all right?

741
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:14,625
I told him.

742
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah.

743
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,416
(laughing) (cheering)

744
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:26,750
Hey, what the fuck?

745
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:29,291
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

746
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:30,708
Fuck this shit.

747
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:31,250
All right.

748
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:32,208
Hey, hey.

749
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:32,625
Hey, hey.

750
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,875
Keep your fucking hands off of me.

751
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,333
Fucking drama queen, let's go.

752
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:39,875
See you.

753
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,416
(grunting)

754
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:45,750
(crowd cheering)

755
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,750
(grunting)

756
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,375
(grunting)

757
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,916
(grunting)

758
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,291
(grunting)

759
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,000
(grunting) (grunting)

760
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,166
Fuck off, go, go, go, go, go.

761
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:58,416
Oh, fuck.

762
00:52:58,791 --> 00:52:59,750
(yelling)

763
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:02,250
What the fuck?

764
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:04,791
(yelling)

765
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:05,791
Okay, okay, okay.

766
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:06,208
Okay.

767
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:07,458
(yelling)

768
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:08,250
You want to get smashed?

769
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,625
No, I don't want to get smashed.

770
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:14,458
(laughing)

771
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,541
Hey, hey, hey, hey, push.

772
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,000
Ah, we're really gonna do this right now?

773
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,500
Yeah, man, you got it, you got it.

774
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,250
Oh, fuck.

775
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,291
Shit, yeah.

776
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,166
Yeah, big American tough guy.

777
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,083
You think you are
socialist pussies over here, huh?

778
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,000
What the fuck are you playing at?

779
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,750
Hey, oh, wait,
wait, wait, wait, I got one.

780
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,833
I'm not gonna make you proud right now.

781
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:37,875
(speaking foreign language)

782
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,416
You got it.

783
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:42,375
You don't like it?

784
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:43,750
Quick, quick, fuck.

785
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:44,875
It's shit, shit.

786
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,083
Come on, I knew that was good.

787
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:49,291
Donny.

788
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:50,916
Fucking hurt my back.

789
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,166
(laughing)

790
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:57,833
Hey, hey.

791
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,333
Hey, hey, hey, we
got a fucking free ride?

792
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:01,625
This is a bad idea.

793
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:02,500
Scooter time.

794
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:03,791
This is bad.

795
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,291
It's just pressed down on the right.

796
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:06,041
Oh, shit.

797
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,958
This sounds fucking fun for once, man.

798
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,791
Oh, shit.

799
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:09,500
Yeah, woo-hoo!

800
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:10,541
Oh, shit.

801
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:11,791
Woo-hoo!

802
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:12,791
Oh, shit.

803
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,708
50 fucking miles an hour?

804
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,500
(engine revving) Roll on!

805
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,250
(laughing) You just slow ass out my way.

806
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,041
I thought white people watched NASCAR.

807
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,291
You're my bitch!

808
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,458
Woo-hoo!

809
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:27,041
Wait.

810
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:28,708
Fuck.

811
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,000
What the fuck is wrong with you?

812
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:34,958
(grunting)

813
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:37,166
(grunting)

814
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:37,791
(grunting)

815
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:38,250
(sniffing)

816
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:38,708
Oh.

817
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,500
(panting)

818
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,625
Oh, my God.

819
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:43,750
That bitch.

820
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,583
Got a horse.

821
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,291
Those are frogs.

822
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:53,958
(laughing)

823
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:57,250
That's a cock.

824
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,916
Don't say it like that.

825
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,041
Please call it rooster.

826
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:00,833
Rooster's life.

827
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:01,916
Just fucking remember.

828
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:04,416
I'm fucking starving.

829
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,250
I need water.

830
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,000
You like shawarma?

831
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:09,625
I don't know.

832
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:18,041
(engine revving) (engine revving)

833
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:28,250
Hey.

834
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:31,958
How'd you find me?

835
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:35,291
I looked.

836
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,000
I looked.

837
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,000
So how'd you do it?

838
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,291
Do what?

839
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:44,875
(laughing)

840
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,666
That isn't missing anything.

841
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,541
There you have it.

842
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,166
How the fuck does the fed up?

843
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,791
No idea it's been ripped off.

844
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,291
How's that happen?

845
00:55:59,333 --> 00:55:59,958
You tell me.

846
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,083
You stole the old money

847
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,875
before it was shredded, huh?

848
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:06,708
Unfit currency.

849
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,083
(laughing) Technically.

850
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:09,750
I read that somewhere.

851
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,625
I fucking knew it.

852
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:12,666
Hey, stop.

853
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,250
I fucking knew it.

854
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,208
Look, you gotta be fucking loaded, right?

855
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:20,458
Come on.

856
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,166
I don't know rich
people, but isn't it enough?

857
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:25,916
Why don't you stop?

858
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,458
I don't get it.

859
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,375
I can't.

860
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:31,666
You know where I'm from?

861
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:32,291
Hawthorne.

862
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:33,083
Mm-hmm.

863
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:34,208
I know everything.

864
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:35,958
And they're doty and rosecranes.

865
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,416
With the Popeye and the Cornoo

866
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:38,916
next to the Hawaiian barbecue place.

867
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,416
I killed that Hawaiian barbecue spot.

868
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:42,708
Right, with a side of fried rice?

869
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,625
Yeah, pineapple chicken.

870
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:45,750
Fuck yeah.

871
00:56:48,875 --> 00:57:00,416
(clears throat) My Pops.

872
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:05,625
My Pops was blasted right in front of me

873
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:07,958
when I was six years old.

874
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,125
Some pi-rues at a larger part.

875
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,916
My mom, she had to support us.

876
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,083
She was a server at Marie Callender's

877
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,125
at the Delama Mall.

878
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:18,125
She ain't make shit.

879
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,416
One year for Christmas,

880
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,291
all she could afford was a

881
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:29,708
a nerve hoop that me
and my sister had to share.

882
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,416
That next year, I
was always good in school

883
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,250
and they moved me to
this magnet school in Torrance.

884
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:39,208
The only thing is I had
to walk to that motherfucker.

885
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:42,750
Three miles.

886
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,125
Every day.

887
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,250
It was in a nice area,

888
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,291
so the closer I got to school

889
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,333
around that last mile,

890
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:56,916
I started to see the shift.

891
00:57:57,958 --> 00:58:00,750
Nice, big houses, super clean yards.

892
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:04,083
So I started to play
this little game in my mind.

893
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,541
I started to see patterns.

894
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,875
See if I can memorize all the houses,

895
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,583
how many people lived in it,

896
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,000
if they would go to work, for how long?

897
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:17,750
When papers would start
to stack up on the front step.

898
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:21,041
Who had dogs, who
didn't, what type they were.

899
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,875
Had that neighborhood clocked in no time.

900
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:32,375
So, Christmas is coming back around,

901
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:37,083
and I feel my mama's anxiety.

902
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,875
Another fucking year,

903
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:43,750
where she can't get her shit.

904
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,916
On my way to school, I decided to look

905
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,208
and see what was in one of them houses.

906
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:52,875
It'll never be enough.

907
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:54,833
It's because it's not about the money.

908
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,541
It's about the challenge.

909
00:58:57,708 --> 00:59:00,250
Can I get in and get out

910
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,458
without anyone even knowing I was there?

911
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:09,791
And I just started leveling up.

912
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,041
Where you gonna meet for Christmas?

913
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,041
A coupon to the Hofbrau.

914
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:16,250
I fucking love that place.

915
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:23,208
Seeing this weird couple's therapy,

916
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,166
my old man owned a liquor store

917
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,416
right over there off the

918
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:44,875
shit from anybody ever.

919
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,791
And there was no way he
was gonna open that register.

920
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,583
I had just 38 that
he kept under the counter.

921
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:54,750
Right there.

922
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,791
And he looked down at it.

923
00:59:58,166 --> 00:59:59,541
These dudes must have gotten spooked

924
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:00,958
that he was gonna blast their ass

925
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:04,333
because one asshole shot him.

926
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,916
Like there.

927
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,250
Carpet of blood just below the hip.

928
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:14,458
He survived.

929
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:18,000
But from that day
on, he had this fucking limp.

930
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,041
He had it to the day he died.

931
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,208
Never the same.

932
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,166
He put a brave face on, but...

933
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:29,250
I used to watch him
work, to work every day.

934
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,750
He just put one
foot in front of the other.

935
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,375
That fucking limp.

936
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,750
Broke my heart.

937
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,958
All I could think about was
getting the motherfuckers that did it.

938
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,083
They never did. Never got them.

939
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,875
When I grew up, first chance I got,

940
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:54,541
I got a gun, I got a
badge, I started to hunt.

941
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:57,583
Fuck.

942
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,041
This time no one gets hurt.

943
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:03,416
Absolutely.

944
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:08,625
(dog barking)

945
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.

946
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,250
Let's go. Okay.

947
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,125
I didn't even call an Uber.

948
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:16,541
Fuck it. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

949
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,000
Get in the fucking car.

950
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,833
(engine rumbling)

951
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:38,625
(speaking Spanish) (somber music)

952
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:53,375
(speaking Spanish)

953
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,916
A few weeks ago there was a flight

954
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:09,041
from Africa to Antwerp.

955
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,250
It had something on it.

956
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,916
Something that belongs to us.

957
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:16,875
To the octopus.

958
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:24,041
And you stole it.

959
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:28,750
Get it back.

960
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:39,708
(engine rumbling)

961
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,041
Hey!

962
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,791
Get the fuck back here!

963
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:48,166
Are you kidding me?

964
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:51,000
You stole diamonds
from the fucking mafia?

965
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:52,416
Like I fucking knew.

966
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:53,500
Fuck!

967
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,208
Where you going?

968
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,541
Nick! Nick!

969
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,625
Take your shoes off.

970
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:05,625
Your sink.

971
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:06,958
Shoes, shoes.

972
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,125
Now what?

973
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:16,750
What the fuck do you think?

974
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,750
Swim. Swim?

975
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,708
Where, Nick? Oh, to Libya.

976
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,083
What the fuck do you
think, dumb, dumb, to shore?

977
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:24,750
I can't swim that fucking farm.

978
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,250
I'm negatively buoyant.

979
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:27,625
Don't you know David Goggin?

980
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:29,541
Fuck me.

981
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,958
Don't be such a pussy.

982
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,000
Fuck you.

983
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:33,708
You think it sucks around here?

984
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,583
Actually, yeah, I think it's infested.

985
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,958
You kind of look like shark food.

986
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,791
Stop talking to me.

987
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:45,916
I hate you.

988
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:47,625
I fucking hate you, too.

989
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:07,208
(Wet splashing)

990
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,333
(Grunting)

991
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:32,208
Fuck it.

992
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:33,750
I'm out.

993
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:35,583
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your "me"?

994
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:36,708
I'm out.

995
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:40,625
Capo di Tutti Capio, where the
fucking skull is where I draw the line.

996
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,791
They go after
families. They don't give a fuck.

997
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,208
You can't do me like that.

998
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,041
All right, I'm dead if you don't.

999
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,958
Well, you're the one that
stole the fucking diamond. I didn't.

1000
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:52,208
What's...

1001
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,500
You going bail on me,
you might as well arrest me.

1002
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:58,333
Fuck it.

1003
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,500
(Panting)

1004
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:08,750
Don't fucking follow me.

1005
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,250
You followed me here.

1006
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:13,458
Deep out there, bitch.

1007
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:35,500
(Door opens)

1008
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:47,250
(Sniffles)

1009
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:48,250
(Sighs)

1010
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:04,250
(Phone rings)

1011
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:06,666
How's the hangover, Mademoiselle?

1012
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:08,625
You watching?

1013
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:10,458
Yep.

1014
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,250
Most guards don't do shit.

1015
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,541
Smoke, dick around on phones, watch porn.

1016
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,166
Those boys are different.

1017
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:20,166
Very.

1018
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,875
Been clocking those dudes
for weeks. Those dogs can hunt.

1019
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:26,250
Yeah. This is gonna be interesting.

1020
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:28,375
You feeling it?

1021
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:32,583
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

1022
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,000
And the cop goes, gangster.

1023
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,125
Get your ass over here,
man. Your espresso's getting cold.

1024
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:51,375
The WDC has no fire doors, no
emergency exit, or increase point.

1025
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:52,958
There's only one door.

1026
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:54,916
One way in, one way out.

1027
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:59,083
Any moments within the district
will result in you coming at a picture.

1028
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,333
So there's only one
place they're not looking.

1029

1030

He's on sale or something?

1034
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,416
Where are my two boyfriends?

1035
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:25,916
They're out.

1036
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:34,750
Welcome.

1037
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,958
Mako and Vuk, when on?

1038
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:54,250
Your partner now.

1039
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
This is the entire theater.

1040
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,833
We've reckoned every
security measure in the district.

1041
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,833
As you can see, there are no dead zones.

1042
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,541
So we'll have to create one.

1043
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:12,625
There are 127 cameras fed into
central security right here in this kiosk.

1044
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,041
They only run 10 CCTV monitors.

1045
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:20,125
So those 127 feeds cycle through.

1046
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,041
At 10 second intervals.

1047
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:28,375
At any given time,
117 of those views are dark.

1048
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:32,375
We will perform a time descent that will

1049
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,666
move us undetected
through those dark zones.

1050
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,458
As a result of the CCTV monitoring cycle.

1051
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:42,333
What about the recorded
footage once the cameras are offline?

1052
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:44,875
There's a WDC
privacy law that prevents it.

1053
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:47,291
So no footage is being
recorded. It's just being viewed in real time.

1054
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:52,750
But we have a blind spot and a problem.

1055
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,625
So the only individuals that are
granted access to the vault is the concierge,

1056
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:01,833
the site holders and their
private security who must be law enforcement.

1057
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:05,458
We tried to flip some
internal assets with access but...

1058
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:07,291
So you're our way in.

1059
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:09,500

1060
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:12,250

1061

Well played.

1705
02:05:36,333 --> 02:05:36,750
I guess.

1706
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:40,333
You want something else?

1707
02:05:41,833 --> 02:05:42,583
I have a croissant.

1708
02:05:44,833 --> 02:05:46,833
Oh ho ho, parfait.

1709
02:05:50,708 --> 02:05:52,750
You know you did the
right thing coming in, huh?

1710
02:05:58,833 --> 02:05:59,583
It's strange, huh?

1711
02:06:01,625 --> 02:06:04,000
Living on the other side feels good, no?

1712
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:08,708
Yeah.

1713
02:06:10,916 --> 02:06:11,208
Too good.

1714
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:18,708
Respect.

1715
02:06:24,333 --> 02:06:25,125
Time to go home, huh?

1716
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:28,166
To what?

1717
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:40,833
(somber music)

1718
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:28,833
(speaking in foreign language)

1719
02:07:28,833 --> 02:07:42,166
(speaking in foreign language)
(speaking in foreign language)

1720
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:14,500
(somber music)

1721
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:15,291
That was fun.

1722
02:08:21,125 --> 02:08:21,875
So we're even?

1723
02:08:26,416 --> 02:08:28,833
Yeah, we're even.

1724
02:08:32,708 --> 02:08:33,625
Feel good about yourself?

1725
02:08:39,625 --> 02:08:43,125
Actually, no, I thought
I would feel a little better,

1726
02:08:43,125 --> 02:08:43,625
to be honest.

1727
02:08:47,583 --> 02:08:49,208
You're a piece of shit.

1728
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:03,333
I need to save your life, Phil.

1729
02:09:05,666 --> 02:09:06,416
So that was real?

1730
02:09:08,083 --> 02:09:10,583
Yeah, yeah.

1731
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:16,416
So you've just been
fucking with me, this whole time?

1732
02:09:21,166 --> 02:09:23,625
No, no, not the whole time.

1733
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:27,291
But at the end of the day,

1734
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,625
a tiger just can't change his stripes.

1735
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:32,916
Just can't.

1736
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:39,791
(somber music)

1737
02:09:39,958 --> 02:09:40,916
I'll see you for all I'm.

1738
02:09:45,208 --> 02:09:55,375
By the way, sit back left.

1739
02:10:00,333 --> 02:10:00,833
(somber music)

1740
02:10:00,833 --> 02:10:01,375
(sighs)

1741

(speaking in foreign language)

1750
02:11:43,208 --> 02:11:43,583
Back left!

1751
02:11:45,041 --> 02:11:47,125
(wind howling)

1752
02:11:50,208 --> 02:11:53,041
(wind howling)

1753
02:11:55,541 --> 02:11:56,250
Get ready to move.

1754
02:11:59,291 --> 02:12:03,625
(wind howling)

1755
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:10,416

(wind howling)

1770
02:14:06,083 --> 02:14:07,916
Did we just get this over with already?

1771
02:14:10,083 --> 02:14:11,500
(speaking in foreign language)

1772
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:13,541
No.

1773
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:23,500
(speaking in foreign language)

1774
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:27,208
(speaking in foreign language)

1775
02:14:27,208 --> 02:14:30,458
(speaking in foreign language)

1776
02:14:30,458 --> 02:14:33,125
(speaking in foreign language)

1777
02:14:33,375 --> 02:14:35,750
He says relax, enjoy your beer.

1778
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:47,208
(speaking in foreign language)

1779
02:14:54,166 --> 02:14:56,875
He says that if he wanted you gone,

1780
02:14:57,208 --> 02:14:59,416
that would have happened a long time ago.

1781
02:15:00,541 --> 02:15:01,000
(speaking in foreign language)

1782
02:15:04,958 --> 02:15:06,458
He wants to meet you.

1783
02:15:09,375 --> 02:15:09,583
(speaking in foreign language)

1784
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:15,958
Because he wants to meet
the man who got his goods back.

1785
02:15:18,083 --> 02:15:22,166
(speaking in foreign language)

1786
02:15:22,166 --> 02:15:29,000
Because he wants to
know how the hell you did it.

1787
02:15:29,458 --> 02:15:34,208
You are an hairy fucking hoodie.

1788
02:15:34,916 --> 02:15:39,833
(laughing)

1789
02:15:43,458 --> 02:15:48,708
And now you work for me.

1790
02:15:59,125 --> 02:15:59,875
So what's next?

1791
02:16:04,958 --> 02:16:10,416
(gentle music)

1792
02:16:11,541 --> 02:16:15,166
I was the king of my homeland

1793
02:16:21,708 --> 02:16:24,500
Facing 10% dust

1794
02:16:25,041 --> 02:16:28,666
I'll fight until the end

1795
02:16:29,708 --> 02:16:33,583
(gentle music)

1796
02:16:33,583 --> 02:16:35,333
The features of my dreams

1797
02:16:35,833 --> 02:16:38,541
Raise up and dance with me

1798
02:16:48,041 --> 02:16:49,500
Now and forever

1799
02:16:51,291 --> 02:16:53,125
I will care

1800
02:18:29,708 --> 02:18:32,250
(gentle music)

1801
02:20:29,708 --> 02:20:32,250
(gentle music)

1802
02:20:59,708 --> 02:21:02,250
(gentle music)

1803
02:21:29,708 --> 02:21:32,250
(gentle music)

1804
02:21:59,708 --> 02:22:02,250
(gentle music)

1805
02:22:29,708 --> 02:22:32,250
(gentle music)

1806
02:22:59,708 --> 02:23:02,250
(gentle music)

1807
02:23:29,708 --> 02:23:32,250
(gentle music)

1808
02:23:59,708 --> 02:24:02,250
(gentle music)

1809
02:24:02,291 --> 02:24:04,833
(gentle music)
