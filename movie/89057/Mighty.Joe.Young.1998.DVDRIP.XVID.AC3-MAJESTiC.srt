1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
25.000 English

2
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,231
Jill! Jill!

3
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,669
Jill, what did l tell you?

4
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,236
- But Joe started it.
- Well, it's not good for them
to interact with us.

5
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,033
Besides, that wasn't Joe,
that was Marley.

6
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,392
- No, it wasn't. lt was Joe.
- Joe is just a baby, Jill.

7
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,399
- He's too big to be Joe.
- Check. Check the pictures.

8
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,720
Hey. l said into bed.

9
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,796
l am in bed.

10
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,471
Jill, what made you think
that that gorilla we saw today was Joe?

11
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,750
- l was right, wasn't l?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,429
My notes say that Joe
is only six months old.

13
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,836
Either l got confused
or Joe is a very unusual gorilla.

14
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,430
- l told you so.
- Yeah, you did.

15
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,473
And Mommy's gonna write in her journal
that my trusted colleague,
Dr Jill Young...

16
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,909
showed me the error of my ways.

17
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,591
Now go to sleep.

18
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,193
Excuse me, Doctor.

19
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,595
- Night, Kweli.
- Good night, Jilly.

20
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
- What is it, Kweli?
- You must come quickly.

21
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,518
- Mommy, can l come?
- Stay here, sweetheart.

22
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,038
- But l want to go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

23
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,549
You stay here, child.

24
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,758
- Poachers.
- East of the village.

25
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,959
They're at it again.

26
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,152
N'Gai Zamu.
Mystical monsters.

27
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,477
There is only one thing you should be
afraid of on this mountain...

28
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,070
and it's staring you right in the face.

29
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,953
Gorilla. Fresh.

30
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,355
We're close.

31
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,393
We've gotta stop them.
Everybody spread out.

32
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,558
- Get the baby.
- Give me the bag.

33
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,037
Don't worry.
We want you alive.

34
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,195
Garth!

35
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,880
Garth! Kill him!

36
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,355
Joe!

37
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,071
Give me the gun!

38
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,030
Joe? Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

39
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,470
She's got to be here somewhere.

40
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,672
The woman's
got that damn devil with her.

41
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,950
But l think you might have shot her.

42
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,154
These people want to live like heroes.
Let them die like heroes.

43
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,879
Oh! Oh! That little demon took off
my thumb and trigger finger.

44
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,790
What if you shot the woman?
We should help her.

45
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,831
No. Let's get out of here.

46
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,918
Yeah. That looks bad. Better get back
before you bleed to death.

47
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,237
l will kill this little monkey.
l swear l will kill him!

48
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,638
- You'll never play the violin again,
that's for sure.
- Shut up!

49
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,029
- Mommy!
- Jill.

50
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
Mommy!

51
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,434
Jill.

52
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,711
- Mom, there were men and they--
- l know. l know.

53
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,274
l know, darling. l know.

54
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,070
Are you okay, Mommy?

55
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,437
Oh, look who's here.
Hello, Joe.

56
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,076
- He's scared.
- l know.

57
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,829
Poor baby.
He lost his mommy tonight.

58
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,557
He needs someone to protect him.
Will you do that for me?

59
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,957
Promise me you'll protect him.

60
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,038
l promise.

61
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,915
Jill! Jill!

62
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,439
Come on, Joe. Come on.

63
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,111
- You must be Pindi.
- The one and only, bro. Come.

64
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,157
Six men, three cars. That's
everything you asked for, Mr O'Hara.

65
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,750
All paid for in advance
out of Pindi's own pocket.

66
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,674
These guys wouldn't be poachers.

67
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,792
l asked for experienced trackers.

68
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,072
These men are the best.
l assure you, the very best.

69
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,478
Let's get this show on the road.

70
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,155
Hey, you've got a nice piece here.
What are we hunting? Elephants?

71
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,272
- We're not hunting anything.
- Aha. Tranquillizer darts.

72
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,755
l agree.
Much nicer to animals than bullets.

73
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,348
- Your men know how to use these, right?
- Oh, sure, boss.

74
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,392
We only have professionals here.

75
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,399
So, you tell me.
Where are we going today?

76
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,994
- There.
- There?

77
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,472
That's not such a good mountain, boss.
The men don't like it very much at all.

78
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,239
You see, there is a legend they believe
in that a creature lives there.

79
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,716
N'Gai Zamu,
sacred guardian of Mount Pangani.

80
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,073
They say any man who enters his domain
is never heard of again.

81
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,431
You know it?

82
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,152
How strange.

83
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,397
That's not, by any chance,
what you're looking for, is it, boss?

84
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,034
Looking for a legend?

85
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,118
Why would l want to do that?

86
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,911
What are you listening to?

87
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,349
Sounds.

88
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,836
Hmm. l understand.
Sounds of the jungle.

89
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,752
l know a guy, he can get you
a CD of jungle sounds cheap.

90
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,711
Even cheaper if you--

91
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,115
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

92
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,630
See, boss? l told you
these men were the best.

93
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,149
Oh!

94
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,276
You're a beauty.

95
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,955
Okay, set him free.

96
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,240
Why bring a cage
if you're not keeping the animal?

97
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,113
'Cause l'm only taking this.

98
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,071
Yes.

99
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,829
Yes, but, um,
l know a guy in Botswana.

100
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,157
He'd pay you 10,000 American dollars
for that leopard.

101
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,352
Now, l'm willing
to split with you 50-50.

102
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,472
Put him in the truck.

103
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,797
Put the cat down now.

104
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,718
You heard him!
Put the cat down!

105
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,317
They never understand me.

106
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,148
- Excuse me, but l think
it's time to leave.
- Don't move!

107
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,669
l'm not moving, but my bowels are.

108
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,951
Don't run. Stay still.

109
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,159
Come on! He's getting away!

110
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,716
- Come on! We're going after him!
- What do you mean, "we"?

111
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,798
There's no way my men will risk
their lives with something like this.

112
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,196
l'll triple your pay.

113
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,071
Don't use the tranqs
unless l give the signal.

114
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,670
Okay, when we catch up to him,
l want you men to herd him towards me!

115
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,989
Now, one second, one second.
Herd him towards us? Why?

116
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,069
l gotta be close to get a blood sample.
Real close.

117
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,279
No, no, don't shoot! No!

118
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,597
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

119
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,190
- They'll live.
- Bet you provide a great health plan.

120
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,997
Look at the way he moves!
Magnificent!

121
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,112
Watch out!

122
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,158
- You stupid fool!
- Come on. We're gonna lose him.

123
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,635
Come on. Let's go!

124
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,952
What the hell is that guy tryin' to do?

125
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,993
Hey! Hey!

126
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,196
l can't see him.
He's gone, long gone.

127
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,676
No, no, he's coming out
on the other side of those trees.
We gotta get in front of him.

128
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,396
There he is!

129
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,238
What's he--

130
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,432
Get down!

131
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,678
Did you see that?
Did you see what he did?

132
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,791
Yes. Yes.

133
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,036
He picked up the chain.
Did you see the intelligence?

134
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,436
Yes, l saw the intelligence!
He almost took my head off!

135
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,196
- Hurry up, bro. Let's go.
- Get these men down the mountain
and bandaged up.

136
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,596
- You're not coming with us?
- Are you kidding?

137
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,836
Crazy American.
Okay!

138
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,718
Joe! Joe!

139
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,272
- Joe!
- Help!

140
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,311
Joe, stop!

141
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,239
Hey, can you get him
to put me down?

142
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,196
Joe, drop him.

143
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,760
- Where am l?
- The infirmary.

144
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,269
You've been unconscious
for an entire night.

145
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,995
- You're lucky to be alive.
- l don't feel very lucky.

146
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,317
You crashed your vehicle.
lt's waiting for you outside.

147
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,715
You're an injury behind.

148
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,709
The kicker was getting
dropped on my head by N'Gai Zamu.

149
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,033
Oh, you think that's funny?
You oughta try it.

150
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,357
N'Gai Zamu is just a legend,
my friend.

151
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,792
No, he's a giant gorilla
with a mean backhand.

152
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,639
Wait. There was a woman.

153
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,478
- A woman.
- Out in the jungle.

154
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,750
A beautiful woman.
She saved my life.

155
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,633
l think it would be wise for you
to see a doctor in Kimanjay.

156
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,910
l took the liberty
of calling one for you.

157
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,873
- Don't need one.
- But he's expecting you.

158
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,790
lf you can drive,
l think it's best that you leave today.

159
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,318
Our visitor must be feeling better.
He should leave the infirmary by today.

160
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,159
Looks like he already has.

161
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,353
He's walking so soon?
Joe should've dropped him harder.

162
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,358
He's not a poacher, Jill.

163
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,359
The man works for animal conservancy
in California.

164
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,749
He can't be trusted.
He's an outsider.

165
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,312
He said he was saved yesterday
by-- by a woman.

166
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,590
A beautiful woman.

167
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,353
And what did you tell him?

168
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,350
What can l tell him, Jill? The man
knows what he saw. He's not a fool.

169
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,831
Hey, big guy.
How are ya? Hmm?

170
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,193
What were you doin' stompin' around,
lookin' for trouble yesterday, huh?

171
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,552
You're not supposed to
let people see you, remember?

172
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,515
Don't do that again, okay?
Please.

173
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,915
Please.

174
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,191
You wanna play? Okay.

175
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,232
You ready?

176
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,439
One, two...

177
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,793
three, four, five...

178
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,198
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

179
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,910
Ready or not, here l come.

180
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,158
Joe!

181
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,671
Where are you, big fella?
l'm coming to get you.

182
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,910
Oh, my.

183
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,271
l wonder where Joe can be.

184
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,519
Come out, wherever you are.

185
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,074
l found you!

186
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,829
Yes. Yes, l did.

187
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,157
Yeah.
Tryin' to hide from me.

188
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,118
You wanna go and find me?
Okay.

189
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,390
Close your eyes.

190
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,239
Ready? Go.

191
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,957
Come on, Joe.

192
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,475
Nice monkey.

193
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,272
Joe.

194
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,073
Joe, it's okay.

195
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,270
Joe, run. Get out of here.

196
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,395
Thanks. Hide-and-seek's
not really my game.

197
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,473
Anything broken?

198
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,478
No. No, l think l'm--
Hey, thanks.

199
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,476
- l think it's okay.
- Oh, good.

200
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,794
- l think it's still working.
- Oh, great.

201
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,036
- l can fix that for you.
- No, wait--

202
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,075
Hey, w-where you goin'?
W-W-Wait a minute!

203
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,350
Hey, hold on a second.
What's the problem?

204
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,038
You. You're the problem.

205
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,230
This is the second time
l've saved you from being killed.

206
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,351
Next time l'm just gonna watch.
You understand?

207
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,109
Okay. A-All right.
You saved me, and l'm grateful.

208
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,356
Thank you, Miss Young.

209
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,074
l know who you are.
You're Ruth Young's daughter.

210
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,794
Did she know about Joe?
Did she have a theory on him?

211
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,876
How did you keep him a secret
all these years?

212
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,036
By keeping people like you
off this mountain.

213
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,594
People like me?
l-l wanna help you.

214
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,598
You go back to where you came from
and tell them what you saw...

215
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,075
this place will be crawling
with people.

216
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,954
That's gonna happen anyway.
Look, l'm not the only one who saw him.

217
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,435
An animal as rare as Joe
means big money.

218
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,235
lt's gonna be tough trying to
protect him here. Maybe impossible.

219
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,477
Here is where he lives.
He doesn't have a choice.

220
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,433
That's not true. The people l work for
could take care of Joe.

221
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,391
They have the facilities.

222
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,432
A cage?
That's just what Joe needs.

223
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,357
No, no, not a cage.
A preserve.

224
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,552
A place where he'll be free--
free from poachers, land developers.

225
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,558
- A place he'll be safe.
- But he won't be free.

226
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,198
How long do you think
he can stay free here?

227
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,233
The next people who come
are gonna be coming to hunt Joe down.

228
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,632
Quite an impressive facility
you have here, Mr Strasser.

229
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,159
- Thank you.
- Tell me.

230
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,432
Why is it that you keep such a
low profile about this wonderful place?

231
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,553
Our only interest
is the well-being of our animals.

232
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,310
Well, l think l've come
to the right place for Morris.

233
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,079
l'm sure you have.

234
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,392
He's grown out of his habitat
and...

235
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,239
well, our zoo just doesn't have
the budget to do anything about it.

236
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,718
- That's why he needs a new home.
- That's the telephone for you,
Mr Strasser. lt's urgent.

237
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,400
- Will you excuse me, Mr Anderson?
- Sure.

238
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,954
l'll be back.

239
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,075
Garth, see what the market is
for the organs of this lovely panda.

240
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,158
- Ooh, big fella. We should get a lot.
- Strasser.

241
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,078
lt's about time. Do you know
how long l've been waiting?

242
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,910
- What do you want, Pindi?
- Not what l want, boss. What you want.

243
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,110
How about a giant gorilla?

244
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,437
- Talk.
- As big as three men.

245
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,917
- Two thousand pounds, at least.
- You've been drinking, haven't you?

246
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,636
l swear to God, boss, l saw him
with my own two eyes. He's-- He's huge!

247
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,478
Don't waste my time, Pindi.

248
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,271
Hello? Boss?

249
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,472
Two-thousand pound gorilla.
He's crazy.

250
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,353
Stupid girl. What do you think
you are doing? Huh?

251
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,550
l found this in the forest
this morning.

252
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,831
Thought maybe you dropped it
and might want it back!

253
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,599
Poaching's illegal!
Get off this mountain.

254
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,951
Jill.

255
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,277
Jill, l need to talk to you.
Jill--

256
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,037
Murderer.

257
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,877
Your mother slept in this bed.
She worked at this desk.

258
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,515
She died in this jungle. Do you plan
to do everything just like her?

259
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,915
My mother would've been proud
of what l did today.

260
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,477
Proud? Of this foolishness out there?
Proud of you risking your life?

261
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,070
She risked hers.
Why shouldn't l risk mine?

262
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,318
Kweli, l'm just trying
to keep a promise here,
and l promised to take care of Joe.

263
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,034
And l will do everything it takes
to stop those poachers.

264
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,833
You cannot stop them.

265
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,952
Even she could not stop them.

266
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,870
The other gorillas, they have moved
south to safer lands. Joe stays behind.

267
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,754
They won't accept him.
Joe needs me.

268
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,990
The danger here is building
for both of you.

269
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,271
l feel it, and so do you.

270
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,837
l know what the American
is offering, Jill.

271
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,430
Consider it.
That's all l ask.

272
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,636
- Leaving?
- Yeah, l'm heading up
into the mountains.

273
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,196
See if l can throw
some of those dirtbags off Joe's trail.

274
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,550
- Think it will work?
- Not for long.

275
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,591
l'm just tryin' to buy you some time.

276
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,396
l suggest you get Joe as deep into the
jungle as you can, as fast as you can.

277
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,553
- Okay.
- Okay what?

278
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,434
- Okay, we'll go with you.
- We?

279
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,269
Me and Joe, we'll go with you to that,
that place of yours in California.

280
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,551
-You sure about this?
-No, l'm absolutely not sure about this.

281
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,114
- But l'll do this on one condition.
- Name it.

282
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,629
- l'm in charge of Joe.
- Done.

283
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,988
- "Done"?
- Done.

284
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,475
- Just like that?
- Just--

285
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,474
- You're not very trusting, are you?
- No, l'm not.

286
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,478
lt must be tough for you, then,
trying to measure me up...

287
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,637
-trying to decide if l'm full of it or--
-Or just a fool?

288
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,230
l guess we'll just have to
figure it out as we go along.

289
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,955
Look, what do you want me to say?
You'll be in charge of Joe. Okay?

290
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,513
Come on.
We'll shake on it.

291
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,509
l don't shake. That's not how
we make pacts around here.

292
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,313
All right, how do you
make pacts around here?

293
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,671
You have to endure a bite
from a Makiki spider.

294
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,678
- A what?
- You'll have a high fever,
hallucinations.

295
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,032
You'll say things, lots of things.
l'll hear what's in your heart.

296
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,153
Then, if your intentions prove true,
then we have a pact.

297
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,397
Spider bite and hallucinations?

298
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,272
That's right.

299
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,789
Then you'll trust me to take you
and Joe to California with me?

300
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,480
Absolutely.

301
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,435
Well, what do you say?

302
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,514
l say that's the biggest load of crap
l ever heard in my whole life.

303
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,391
Maybe you're not a fool after all.

304
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,190
Get your things together fast.

305
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,278
We're gettin' out of here
as soon as we can.

306
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,668
Makiki spider.

307
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,594
l don't know what else to do, Joe.

308
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,790
l just want you to be safe.

309
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,912
- You think he's okay back there?
- He's doing fine.

310
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,554
Okay.

311
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,750
l'm sorry.
l'm just a little tense.

312
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,509
You think he's okay back there?

313
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,791
- l think he's okay back there.
- Good.

314
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,629
So this is L.A., huh?
Everything looks the same.

315
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,671
- How do you know where you are?
- lt's easy.

316
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,756
The ocean's that way,
the mountains are that way...

317
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,348
Mexico's that way
and Canada's that-a-way.

318
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,756
You don't have to worry about the rest.
You'll never see it through the smog.

319
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,637
Maybe you'd better check and see
if Joe's okay back there.

320
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,038
Mom! M-Mom!

321
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,358
Main gate to Dr Banks.
They're pulling up now.

322
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,838
l copy that. Okay, everybody!
Elvis is in the building!

323
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,437
- He's big!
- Did you see him?

324
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,599
- The fun begins.
- You hear that, Harry? They smell him.

325
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,518
Who, Gregg or the gorilla?

326
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,153
All right, l'm a little confused,
O'Hara, because you phoned us...

327
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,396
- to say you're bringing back
a 2,000-pound animal--
- Hello, Harry. Hiya, gorgeous.

328
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,431
- Welcome back, Gregg.
- But security tells me...

329
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,630
you requested no fire hoses
and no restraints of any kind. So what--

330
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,194
- Come on, let me introduce you
to somebody.
- Well, how are we supposed to
control this animal?

331
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,038
With a giant rolled-up newspaper?

332
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,436
- Jill Young,
- Hi.
- l'd like you to meet Dr Harry Ruben,
who runs the place.

333
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,630
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- And Dr Cecily Banks...

334
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,320
- who makes sure he doesn't screw it up.
- Hi. Nice to meet you both.
- Hi. Hi.

335
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,557
Hold on, big guy. l'm comin'.

336
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,437
l think he's ready to come out.

337
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,358
Harry, l think it's time you met Joe.

338
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,475
l know it looks small,
but this is just the entrance.

339
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,512
- He has the entire hill to roam.
- Okay.

340
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,710
Jack, Vern, what, are we gonna
have to hose you guys down too?

341
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,115
- Come on, get the sedatives ready.
- No, no, no.

342
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,629
- We don't need any of that. He-- That--
- Miss Young, don't worry.
We know what we're doing here.

343
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,079
- But what-- l--
- The best way to handle--
- Hey, hey, wh-- Hold on.

344
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,397
Harry, you and l had an agreement.
The lady's in charge of Joe.

345
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,559
- Well, how is she gonna handle--
- Easy, tiger. Come on.

346
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,955
Calm down. Come on.

347
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,435
- Okay, guys, l got it.
- All right.

348
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,357
You sure you got everything
under control?

349
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,234
Yeah. Come on.

350
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,874
- You sure she knows what she's doing?
- She knows.

351
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,912
You want me to come in there
and get you?

352
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,237
There you go. Come on.

353
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,193
Come look at your new home.

354
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,198
Come on. There you go.

355
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,639
Come on, Joe.
Come on. Come on.

356
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,749
Hey, come on, Vern. What am l
paying you for? Get some pictures.

357
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,950
- All right.
- And get me in there too.

358
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,310
You know, for perspective.

359
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,473
Okay. lt's okay, Joe.

360
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,759
Hey. Hey, Joe, come on.
Nothing happened.

361
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,872
You're not scared of those people,
are you?

362
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,709
l promise nothing
will happen to you, okay?

363
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,718
- Come on, Joe.
- Come on, Joe. Come on.

364
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,791
Okay, there you go.
Yeah, you big guy.

365
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,912
Come on, Joe.

366
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,634
There you go.
Come on, big guy.

367
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,035
Come on.

368
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,589
- l think he's gonna be fine.
- l'm glad.

369
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,711
Jack, let's move that platform
out of there, okay?

370
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,638
- Oh, no.
l'm going back in there with him.
- Oh, no, no, l'm sorry.
We can't allow that.

371
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,274
You see, we don't have insurance
to cover anyone in there
who's not an employee.

372
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,789
- You're not serious.
- But-- But l'm supposed to be
in charge of Joe.

373
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,798
Yes, you are,
and l'm in charge of this facility.

374
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,195
Let's go. Take it up.

375
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,636
Okay, swing it up.

376
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,992
"And l'm in charge of this facility."
l mean, who does he think he is?

377
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,908
l bet that man has never spent
one night outside in his entire life.

378
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,439
Probably not.

379
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,438
Well, here are your new
deluxe accommodations.

380
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,075
l should be out there with Joe,
not here, not in this--

381
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,076
this cage.

382
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,512
Look, l know how you feel.
lt's not exactly my idea
of home, sweet home either.

383
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,108
But at least you're close to Joe.

384
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,791
- Doin' a lot better.
- Oh.
- Where's Gregg?

385
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,480
Talk to you later. l-l don't know.
You know, he collected his paycheck.

386
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,592
He's probably in some jungle by now
looking for giant sheep.

387
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,792
Well, l think he should be here.
l mean, this is his discovery.

388
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,957
Excuse me. Gregg's expertise
is crashing Humvees.

389
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,709
lt's not explaining primate behaviour to
the chairman of the conservancy board.

390
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,274
You know what l think, Harry?
l think you're jealous.

391
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,152
l'm crippled with envy, yes.

392
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,990
l mean, you know, just once
l wanted to go into the field
and find a new species.

393
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,033
- You know? Anything. A mollusc.
- Here we go.

394
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,720
- Huh.
- Harry. Dr Banks.
- Hi.

395
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,751
So, let's go see him.

396
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,431
See, the gorillas in the Pangani carry
this recessive gene that pops up
every four or five generations...

397
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,437
- Huh.
- with this rare form of gigantism.

398
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,312
And that's where the legend comes from.

399
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,274
But l knew it was more than a legend,
so l followed my gut instinct.

400
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,630
l just had a hunch
that this thing was true.

401
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,957
- Pretty damn sharp, Harry.
- All right, here we are.

402
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,670
- Pretty cool, huh?
- My, my, l should say so.

403
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,032
- Where is he?
- Um--

404
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,799
Uh, Joe!

405
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,115
Come here, Joe!

406
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,475
Come here, boy!

407
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,236
Gorillas. There's never one around
when you need 'em.

408
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,638
- Even for the chairman of the board.
- Well, l came here to see him.

409
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,035
You know what? Maybe-- Maybe--
You know what? l'll feed him.

410
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,593
- That'll-- That'll get him to come out.
- Um, Harry--

411
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,631
No, no, no. No, no. Don't worry.
l know what l'm doing.

412
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,673
Elliot, you stay here.
l'm gonna go open the gate. Okay?

413
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,349
Silver, brown, blond, white. There are
nine different colours to choose from.

414
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,519
And naturally, Ron, you have to ask
things like toxicity. Uh, is it safe?

415
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,517
This product has been tested
for ten years.

416
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,712
lt's not just a coloured spray,
like some of you might be thinking.

417
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,437
lt's just a plain, ordinary cosmetic,
and it just washes out in the evening.

418
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,319
- l was coming to get you.
- What's that noise?

419
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,715
The security alarm in Joe's habitat.
Come on!

420
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,352
- Joe-- Joe--
- What's happening?
- He's been-- He's going crazy!

421
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,597
Open the gate!

422
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,199
Open it! Open it!

423
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,515
- Hold it! Don't shoot!
- No!

424
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,715
Oh, God.

425
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,559
- Harry, it's okay.
- lt doesn't feel okay.

426
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,831
Listen to me.
Just jump out from behind the trees.

427
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,838
No-- No, l'd rather not.

428
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,316
Just jump out and say,
"You found me."

429
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,908
Well, he knows he's found me!
That's the problem!

430
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,589
Harry, do what she says.

431
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,194
You found me!

432
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,669
Oh, God!
He's playing with him.

433
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,314
Harry, he's playing with you.

434
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,476
- Hide-and-seek.
- What?

435
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,875
Shh. Watch.

436
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,591
Joe! Where are you?

437
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,350
Now, where could Joe be?
Here he is!

438
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,836
- Feeding time over, Harry?
- You wanted me to find you, didn't you?
- Very funny.

439
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,111
Good thing Joe didn't
want to play doctor.

440
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,110
Look at you, all happy. Huh, Joe?
That makes me so happy.

441
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,595
- Harry.
- You know what?
That never happened before.

442
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,429
-Th-- lt was weird, wasn't it, the way--
-Put that girl in charge of the gorilla.

443
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,391
Elliot,
she has no scientific training.

444
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,069
That ape is the best fund-raising tool
this conservancy has ever had.

445
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,589
He's happy, l'm happy.

446
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,597
So you really think
that she's gonna be able to, you know--

447
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,032
- Put her on the payroll, Harry.
- Okay.

448
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,435
- Did you see that? Did you see that?
- l saw it.

449
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,312
- He was playing hide-and-seek with him!
- lt's great.

450
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,876
Oh, my God!
You were right. He likes it here.

451
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,553
Oh, my God! On his second day,
he's playing! He likes it here!

452
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,472
- You got it bad.
- What are you talking about?

453
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,955
- You know what l'm talking about.
- No, no, no, no, no.

454
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,470
Usually you are out the door
as soon as the animal's in its habitat.

455
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,478
You have a very active imagination.

456
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,556
- l don't think so.
- Oh, l think so.

457
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,750
No, l don't think so.

458
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,793
l think Mr World Traveller
has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.

459
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,709
Just close your eyes,
and then he's gonna do that, and then
you say, "You found me!" Come on!

460
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,998
Behind me is the habitat
of what the experts are calling...

461
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,113
one of the worlds's most important
zoological finds of this century.

462
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,835
This is the home of what is believed
to be the world's largest primate...

463
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,270
a 2,000-pound gorilla named Joe.

464
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,837
Joe has been at
the California Animal Conservancy
for a little over a month now.

465
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,157
He was brought here from Africa
by Dr Gregory O'Hara...

466
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,475
- who told me that
because of Joe's remarkable size...
- My God.

467
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,070
- Pindi was right.
- he is a natural target for poachers.

468
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,634
Fortunately, the California
Animal Conservancy's programme...

469
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,469
- He's beautiful.
- is rescuing animals
and bringing them here so they--

470
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,670
lt's the most beautiful animal
l ever seen.

471
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,598
And the most valuable,
that's for sure.

472
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,995
And he can't escape
because it's surrounded by a moat...

473
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,271
and there are also some electrical wires
around the entire perimeter.

474
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,391
- lsn't that the--
- Wait. Be quiet.
- Joe was raised from infancy...

475
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,308
by Jill Young, the daughter of
famed primatologist Ruth Young.

476
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,238
Their closeness stems
from a tragic bond.

477
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,955
Both Joe's and Jill's mothers
were killed by poachers 12 years ago...

478
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,798
- Bloody hell! That's him!
- in the Pangani forest.

479
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,150
They both became orphans
on the same night.

480
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,919
That's him! That's the little fella
who bit your finger off!

481
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,119
l'm always amazed how...

482
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,959
if you wait long enough...

483
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,198
the opportunity for justice
finally comes.

484
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,471
Garth, book us
two tickets to America.

485
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,353
We are going to pay a visit
to this incredible animal.

486
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,871
l think l know how to convince
his current owners to part with him.

487
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,631
Now, this fellow is one of only
300 wild yaks remaining on the planet.

488
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,072
Now, you may ask: Why should we care
if this subspecies of yak survives?

489
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,875
- But if we don't protect--
- Excuse me. Uh, could we see Joe?

490
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,355
- Yeah. We want to meet Joe.
- Yes, you can certainly all see Joe...

491
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,553
for the mere price of
a diamond circle benefactor ticket
to tomorrow night's benefit.

492
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,992
But, you know, this is for a good cause.
lt's for the preservation
of endangered species.

493
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,074
You remember, don't you?

494
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,598
So this is what you call
a good meal in a fine restaurant?

495
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,756
Yeah.

496
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,839
lt's my favourite restaurant,
'cause they let you take off your shoes.

497
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,359
My granddad used to bring me fishing
down here when l was a kid.

498
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,153
Wow. The Pacific Ocean.

499
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,109
That's nice. Live music.

500
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,152
l hired him special.

501
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,874
Ten minutes ago.
You want to dance?

502
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,879
What? So, this is a date
or something?

503
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,878
Not that l'd know.
l've never been on one before.

504
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,912
Yeah, well, l guess most guys
are afraid of a girl's father.

505
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,828
l can just see a guy telling Joe
he's gonna get you home by midnight.

506
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,033
Well, nobody's ever had to tell Joe
what time they'll have me home by.

507
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,990
What's it like?

508
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,838
- "lt"?
- Yeah.

509
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,590
This whole dating,
dancing, love thing.

510
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,075
Well, it's...

511
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,760
kinda like being bit
by a Makiki spider.

512
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,429
- And how's that?
- You get kind of a fever.

513
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,677
A fever. Ah. And then?

514
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,238
And then you-- you find yourself
saying things, lots of things.

515
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,032
What kind of things?

516
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,116
Things like...

517
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,032
- What is it?
- l'm sorry. lt's this thing.

518
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,793
We gotta go.

519
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,756
l don't understand this animal.

520
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,872
- He's got everything he wants.
- Harry, stop-- Ohh!
- Why can't he just relax?

521
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,877
He's ripping out saplings,
bam, bam, bam!

522
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,433
- He's ripping out irrigation pipes.
- Oh! Really?

523
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,471
- One big yank, here comes the flood.
- Oh, no.

524
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,955
- What happened? What's wrong with him?
- We don't know! Jill, do you?

525
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,913
ls he okay?

526
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,676
- Can you get in there
and calm him down...
- Joe!
- before he relandscapes the habitat?

527
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,348
Joe. lt's okay.

528
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,633
lt's okay.

529
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,714
- lmpossible.
- Please.

530
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,956
l wouldn't be asking you
to postpone the benefit...

531
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,355
unless l thought there was something
really wrong with Joe.

532
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,516
And l do.

533
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,030
From what l hear, you sang him to sleep
last night like a baby.

534
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,435
What's really wrong
about that?

535
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,190
Mr Baker, l swear to you,
Joe is still not himself.

536
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,197
He's-- He's nervous and agitated...

537
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,754
and he shouldn't be exposed
to a crowd of strangers right now.

538
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,633
Look, if you can just please
delay the party just a few more--

539
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,751
- lt's too late, Jill.
- No!

540
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,229
- lt's too soon.
- Miss Young,
let me give you some advice:

541
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,271
Stop worrying about Joe...

542
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,631
and start worrying about what
you'll wear to the party tonight.

543
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,954
Cecily? Oh, l'm sorry.

544
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,629
No, my fault. Excuse me.

545
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,593
- Yes?
- lt's just--

546
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,870
- What?
- You must be Jill Young.

547
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,076
Yes?

548
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,475
And you look just like her.

549
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,875
- Who?
- Your mother.

550
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,996
- You knew my mother?
- Yes.

551
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,078
l'm an old friend
of your mother's.

552
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,954
l knew her when she was, uh,
only a little older than you.

553
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,548
And you were just a tiny thing.

554
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,191
- What an incredible woman she was.
- Yeah.

555
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,959
l'm sorry.
l'm Andre Strasser.

556
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,675
l've come here
to talk with your Mr Baker.

557
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,315
- Actually, l'm here for Joe.
- Joe?

558
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,670
And, in a way,
for your mother too.

559
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,677
l believe
she would agree with me.

560
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,429
A magnificent wild animal
like Joe needs more space...

561
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,358
like the Raja Preserve
l run in Botswana.

562
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,675
Raja Preserve?

563
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,396
lt's 20,000 acres there
where the animals are free to run.

564
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,674
Here it's such a shame to see Joe
living in a man-made habitat...

565
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,633
and being used as an attraction
to raise money.

566
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,150
But l upset you.

567
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,157
- No.
- Please.

568
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,874
l only mean
to offer an alternative.

569
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,714
Anyway, here is my card.

570
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,559
l'll be attending, uh,
the event tonight.

571
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,558
Maybe we can talk more
about this matter then.

572
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,399
l look forward to it.

573
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,397
Yeah. Bye.

574
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,151
Boy, l can't believe
all the V.l.P.s here tonight.

575
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,113
Ooh, don't you clean up nice?

576
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,232
- Cecily, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

577
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,909
Harry, you got a little, um,
cocktail sauce on your shirt there.

578
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,952
Oh, great.
Now l look ridiculous.

579
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,959
No, you look fine.
They look ridiculous.

580
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,196
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well, she doesn't.

581
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,920
l picked out the dress.
Aren't l smart?

582
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,031
Brilliant.

583
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,396
Harry, you're dripping again.

584
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,909
Oh, look at me.
l'm like a mess here.

585
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,794
You know, l have to give a speech
tonight. You-You think anyone'll notice?

586
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,036
No.

587
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,031
Hi.

588
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,993
l feel so stupid
in this dress.

589
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,999
You look anything but stupid.
Come on. Let's get a drink.

590
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,076
She reminds me of somebody...

591
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,033
but l can't think who it is.

592
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,037
You, when we first met.

593
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,231
Why are they staring at me?

594
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,797
They're not staring at you. They're
staring at, uh, that banana tower.

595
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,834
- Very funny.
- Come on.

596
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,952
- That's what l said.
- ls that right?

597
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,112
lt's nice to see you all.
Good evening.

598
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,959
- Quite a turnout.
- All the better.

599
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,834
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please take your seats? Please.

600
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,269
Can l have your attention,
please?

601
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,709
Can l-- Can l have your attention,
please? Just take your seats.

602
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,274
Ooh, l'm sorry. Oh.

603
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,675
Excuse me, sir, you, uh--
you dropped your, uh--

604
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,836
- Key chain.
- Ah, of course.

605
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,839
Garth, you would lose your head
if it wasn't screwed on.

606
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,837
- Nice party, huh?
- Yeah.

607
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,918
- Can l have your attention, please?
Just take your seats.
- Where do we think he's from?

608
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,476
- l don't know.
- l'm Elliot Baker.

609
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,433
The world was once a garden
teeming with life.

610
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,439
A wondrous place to contemplate
creation in all its--

611
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,317
Tonight you'll meet one secret
that would not remain hidden.

612
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,993
- So, you haven't forgotten me?
- Please, can l have your attention?

613
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,432
- As you can hear, this secret
announced itself loud and clear.
- Good.

614
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,869
- ln fact--
- Have you forgotten this?

615
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,830
How much do you think he's worth,
couple of million?

616
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,430
After we sell him off,
piece by piece...

617
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,676
who knows how much we'll make?

618
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,755
- That got you going. Now be
a good boy and frighten the ladies.
- lf l could just have your attention--

619
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,273
- Please, can l have your attention?
Well, our guest seems to be
telling you that l'm talking too long.
- Okay, let's go.

620
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,349
- We've done our job here.
- l'd like to bring up to the podium
the director of our conservancy--

621
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,633
Well, l suppose there's no need
to add to that introduction.

622
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,830
Here's Dr Harry Ruben!

623
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,838
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

624
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,916
ln the time it took you
to drive here tonight...

625
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,749
three species have disappeared
from the Earth.

626
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,316
Extinct.
Never to be replaced.

627
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,989
We here at the conservancy
say this is a tragedy--

628
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,278
Well, uh,
obviously Joe agrees.

629
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,278
- There's something wrong.
- But, um...

630
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,029
tonight, instead of focusing
on what we've lost...

631
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,630
we'd like to introduce you
to something that we've found.

632
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,878
Ladies and gentlemen, behind
this curtain is the newest member...

633
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,594
of the California Animal
Conservancy.

634
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,349
We are very happy and proud
to introduce to you...

635
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,357
Mighty Joe--

636
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,157
Joe?

637
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,191
lt's okay.

638
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,632
Come on, Joe.

639
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,116
No! Joe!

640
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,268
- My God, what's wrong with him?
- He's out of control!

641
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,597
- l'm going for the tranq gun!
- No, Gregg! l'll stop him!

642
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,313
Oh, my God!

643
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,277
Move!

644
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,598
Oh, God.

645
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,190
The gorilla literally
crashed the party.

646
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,276
Officials here at the conservancy
are saying...

647
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,119
they don't know what caused
the animal's rampage.

648
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,310
More than a dozen people
were injured.

649
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,670
Eight of them remain
hospitalized today.

650
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,870
ln fact, three lawsuits
have been filed so far...

651
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,198
and word has it the city's attorney
is calling for the animal
to be put to sleep.

652
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,312
Standing with me is the conservancy
board's chairman, Elliot Baker.

653
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,513
Exactly what is being done to assure
the public that Joe won't attack again?

654
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,031
Joe has been transferred to a special
steel-reinforced concrete bunker.

655
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,438
- But what about when you let him out?
- That won't be happening any time soon.

656
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,472
ln fact, l want to make it clear
that we will be doing...

657
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,831
anything necessary to ensure
the safety of the public.

658
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,953
Mr Baker, with the number of lawsuits
that the conservancy is now facing...

659
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,878
will you shut down the facility
to the public?

660
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,917
Joe.

661
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,915
l'm right here. Okay?

662
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,953
l knew there was
something wrong with him.

663
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,197
What do you think
happened out there?

664
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,915
Joe would have never hurt
those people unprovoked.

665
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,793
Something must've got to him.

666
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,795
Jill?

667
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,718
Could l, um-- Could l
talk to you for a second?

668
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,673
Well, this wasn't
in the brochure, was it?

669
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,150
l promised you wouldn't be
put in a cage.

670
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,318
l'm sorry, Joe.

671
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,799
And then the city attorney talked to
Baker. So, this wasn't my decision.
l had nothing to do with this.

672
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,797
Nothing to do with what?

673
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,310
Joe's gonna have to stay
in here until they decide
what they're gonna do with him.

674
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,237
- ln here?
- Yeah.

675
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,796
Harry, look at him.
He's depressed. He won't eat.

676
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,195
lf he stays in here,
he'll die within days.

677
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,914
Jill, there is nothing we can do
about this.

678
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,316
Listen, Harry,
either you tell them you're getting
Joe out of here, or l will.

679
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,954
Don't you understand?
This is way beyond you and me.

680
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,150
Joe freaked out on some
very influential people.

681
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,157
Now he's a public relations
nightmare.

682
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,431
No zoo will take
a 2,000-pound killer gorilla!

683
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,676
- He's not a killer!
- Okay, okay.

684
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,075
But unless you can write a cheque
for millions of dollars...

685
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,111
and-and-and find him
a big backyard somewhere...

686
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,117
then Joe's got nowhere to go.

687
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,595
l'm sorry.

688
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,433
Harry.

689
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,710
You're not gonna do anything?

690
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,038
l need your help.

691
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,676
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

692
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,439
- Hey, you can't go in there.
- lt's okay. We're here
to give Joe more sedatives.

693
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,757
- Wha-- l, uh--
- Hey, unless you want him
to get frisky on your shift...

694
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:14,158
l suggest you let us get on with our job
so you can get on with yours.

695
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,757
Come on, Joe.
We're leaving.

696
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,997
Yeah. Let's get you
out of here.

697
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,475
What the hell are you doin'?

698
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,989
The gorilla needs his medication,
and l've gotta take him over
to the clinic for that.

699
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,430
- Who says?
- Doctor's orders, and l'm the doctor.

700
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,757
Yeah, well, uh,
l take my orders from Mr Baker...

701
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,269
so, uh, put him back
in his cage now.

702
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,470
Easy, Joe, easy.

703
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,792
Officer, you don't want to point
that thing at him, believe me.

704
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,318
He didn't believe you.

705
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,036
Okay, come on!
Bring him out!

706
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,429
Come on, big guy.
Come on.

707
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,272
Come on, Joe.
lnto the truck.

708
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,277
That's it.

709
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,270
Okay.

710
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,317
Thanks.

711
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,514
l am gonna miss
those big ol' brown eyes.

712
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,950
You be good, Joe.

713
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,674
Goodbye, Joe.

714
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,678
l was just starting to get
the hang of hide-and-seek.

715
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,798
l, uh-- l think you should be
all right up here at the gate.

716
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,118
Someone, uh, just called
the guard away. Urgent business.

717
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,148
You came through for us, Harry.

718
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,034
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

719
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,116
You be sure to write us as soon
as you get Joe settled, okay?

720
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,630
l promise.

721
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,591
Okay. You're all set.

722
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,951
So, you're gonna
come to the airport, or--

723
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,231
No, l'm gonna hang back and make sure
nobody notices Joe's gone.

724
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,352
Give you guys a chance
to make a run for it.

725
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,550
Okay.

726
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,958
Well, if you're ever in Botswana
and feel like taking me out for
a good meal at a fine restaurant--

727
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,993
That is, if you're not too afraid
to let Joe know what time you'll be--

728
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,351
Jill, we should go now.
The plane is waiting.

729
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,196
Come. Let's go.

730
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,276
- Gotta go.
- Yeah.

731
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,277
Okay.

732
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,150
- Hello.
- Hi.

733
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,312
Don't worry, Jill.
Soon Joe will be back home again.

734
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,276
So, what do you think?
How many minutes before
the whole world knows he's missing?

735
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,393
Five. How many minutes before we're
both looking through the want ads?

736
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,670
Six.

737
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,757
- What are you guys doin' here?
- What are you guys doin' here?

738
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,474
Baker wants us
to clean up the tent A.S.A.P.

739
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,070
Yeah, you should see some of the stuff
we found in the post-party melee.

740
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,115
We've got the fun job of figuring out
who all this stuff belongs to.
Somebody's head is very cold right now.

741
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,630
Look at this. What is this thing, eh?
Hey, come on. Look.

742
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,189
- Where did you find this?
- By the habitat. Oh, God,
we gotta find those two guys.

743
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:55,108
- Oh, yeah.
- What two guys?
- What's that-- that one guy,
he was, what, Lithuanian.

744
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,549
- Russian.
- Yeah, Russian. Eastern European.

745
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,036
- ls everything okay?
- That thing's used by poachers!

746
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,634
- Please, be careful.
- Always worrying, huh?

747
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,149
Your mother was a worrier too.

748
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,670
Always worrying
about the gorillas.

749
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,830
lt made her a lot of enemies.
lt led to tragedy.

750
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,754
My mother was brave.

751
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,791
So are you, my dear.

752
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,918
What? lt's not pretty.
l know.

753
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,349
l'm sorry.

754
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,675
How did it happen?

755
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,710
Well, you could say
l had an encounter with a monster.

756
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:05,073
That little demon took off my thumb
and trigger finger!

757
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,197
Come on, come on, come on!

758
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,596
Murderer!

759
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,635
Jeez!

760
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,675
- Joe! Get out!
- Keep driving!

761
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,034
Jill! Are you okay?

762
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:17,154
What did l do?
Those are the guys who killed my mother.
We gotta go! Joe's in trouble!

763
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,516
Whoa!

764
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,276
Stop it!

765
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,679
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Come on. Let's go!

766
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,753
Come on, move it!
Move it!

767
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,678
- Whoa! Look!
- Can you see it?

768
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,913
What? Come on.
Nobody's seen an accident? What?

769
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,392
Oh, my God.

770
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,548
- Phat!
- Come on. Come on!

771
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,871
Will you just go!

772
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,238
- Come on.
- Wait.

773
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,271
The police will be here
any second.

774
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,868
We have to get away from here.
Come on.

775
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,956
Ape! Oh, my God!

776
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,188
Oh, my God.
Let's get out of here!

777
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,110
Move it! Move it!

778
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,717
Far out!

779
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,998
All right!

780
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,515
Turn it off!

781
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,398
- Go, Lisa, go!
- Hurry!

782
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,159
Go! Go, Lisa, go!

783
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,157
Oh, my God!

784
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,868
Oh, my God.

785
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,389
- Oh, my God.
- Shut up! Shut up!

786
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,556
- What are you laughing at?
- That was so cool!

787
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:36,036
- So cool? He almost squashed us!
- That was not funny at all!

788
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,871
- Yeah!
- Go, Joe! Yeah!

789
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,352
All right! Go, Joe!

790
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,595
- Oh, no. He's not here.
- Couldn't have gotten far.

791
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,793
- Come on, girls. Come on. This way.
- Let's go.

792
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,517
Copy that. Our orders are shoot to kill.
He's extremely dangerous.

793
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,632
- Shoot to kill?
He's not dangerous. You're dangerous!
What are you doing with a gun?
- What?

794
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,115
- lt's okay, Officer. lt's okay.
She didn't mean it.
- Calm down.
- l meant it!

795
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,755
- Come on.
- They're going to shoot him.
- Not if we find him first.

796
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,031
What's that?

797
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,311
- That's it. Come on.
We'll follow that helicopter.
- What?
- Come on!

798
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:32,952
l don't wanna hear it. What do you mean?
l'm already 20 minutes late.
Come on. Who's gonna pay for this?

799
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,231
What are you doing?
We can't go after the gorilla now.

800
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,916
- We need a car.
- What is your supervisor's name, huh?

801
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:47,192
- Would you please
step out of the vehicle.
- What's the problem?

802
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:52,519
lt's the fifth time this year. Hey.
Hey! Hey! Hey, l'm goin'! l'm goin'!

803
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,551
You don't have to be
so pushy about it!

804
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,989
Hello? County Animal Control?

805
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,680
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Honey, look at the birdbath.

806
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,598
- Yes! Yes, it was.
lt was a gorilla, a big one!
- Oh, my goodness!

807
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,473
- Did you guys see it?
- Andy, come on, sweetheart.

808
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,353
Andy. No, no.
lt's a gorilla, honey.

809
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,916
SWAT One, SWAT One, this is Police 2-4.
We've found him.

810

Yeah, Police 2-4,
SWAT One's on the scene.

811
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,958
He's goin' in the brush.
Don't lose him.

812

We've got him now.

813
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,232
Look out! Electrical wires!
Pull up! Pull up!

814
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,675
Where'd he go?

815
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,358
- He must have gone under that overpass.
- Well, cut him off.

816
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,790
Bring 'er down.

817
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,752
Must've gone up
that access ramp.

818
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,075
Let's go find 'im.
Let's go.

819
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,430
Where's he headed?

820
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,274
Look. He thinks
it's my flashlight.

821
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,109
He's going towards the light.
He thinks l'm calling him. That's it!

822
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,477
- Daddy!
- Hi, Mommy!

823
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,751
- Mom, l don't think you
should go on this ride.
- Why?

824
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,998
- Because you threw up last time.
Remember?
- Yeah, but what if l promise
to throw up over the side?

825
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,238
- l should go on this by myself.
- Okay. l'll get us some cotton candy.

826
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,272
- Okay.

827
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,356
- Okay.
- Have a good time.

828
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,880
All you gotta do is
hit the pig on the bottom!

829
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,560
That's all you gotta do!

830
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,437
Look!

831
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,629
Oh, my-- Honey, come on. Come on
with Mommy. Give Mommy your hand.

832
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,069
- No, Mommy. No, Mommy, let's stay!
- No, no! No, honey!

833

Please!

834
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,478
Come on. Let's stop it!

835
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,319
Come on, kids, outta there.
There's a wild animal loose.

836
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:53,159
-Come on. Find your parents. Go! Go! Go!
-Whoa!

837

838
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,637
Holy--

839
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,072
Come on.

840
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,988
- There she is.
- Just what exactly are you aiming at?

841
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,877
No! You can't do that.

842
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,629
lf that girl starts telling people
who we really are...

843
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,355
our whole cover operation
will be blown.

844
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,916
- She's not an animal.
She's a human being.
- Joe!

845
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,478
Let's go this way.

846
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,270

- Go on! Find Joe!
- Joe!

850
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:08,308
You're not a hunter, you're a murderer,
and l don't want any part of this.

851
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,475
Anything else on your mind?

852
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,869
The fire's spreadin' pretty fast.
Keep this wheel moving.
We'll get 'em out on the run.

853
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,878
Come on, you guys.
All right. That's it.

854
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,198
- Okay, come on.

Joe!

862
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,837
Goodbye, Jill.

863
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,157
Meet your mother in hell.

864
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:05,918
Goodbye.

865
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,153

- Evacuate the area! Get out of the way!
- No, you don't understand!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

871
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,070

Oh, no! Jason!

- Come on, big guy.
- Easy does it.

902
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,871
- Come on.
- Mommy!
- Oh, yeah, honey.

903
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,275
- Ohh. l'm here.
- Come on, big guy.

904
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,836
- Open your eyes.
- Oh, l'm so sorry.

905
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,155
Come on, Joe!

906
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:38,273
Joe? No. No. No.

907
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,995
- Mommy, is he gonna be okay?
- l don't know, honey.

908
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,271
No. No! Joe!

909
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,994
Keep these people back!

910
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,431
Back it up!

911
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,838
No. No!

912
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,830
Don't leave me, big guy.

913
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,755
Joe?

914
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,028
Joe?

915
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,958
- He's alive!
- He's alive?

916
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:16,275
- Joe!
- He's alive!

917
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,271
- Joe.
- He's alive!

918
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:25,359
You big palooka.
That's no way to ride a Ferris wheel.

919
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,755
Joe! Big guy, you scared me.

920
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,952
We gotta get him outta here,
get him somewhere safe.

921
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,591
Somewhere safe?

922
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,678
Somewhere safe
means a new home for Joe.

923
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,360
Where are we gonna get
that kind of money?

924
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,040
l've got some money for Joe.

925
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,550
Here. For Joe.

926
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:03,150
- Come on, folks. Let's help him out.
- Thank you. Thank you.

927
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,874
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

928
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:16,037
Dear Cecily, l promised to write you
when Joe was settled...

929
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,628
and now l finally can.

930
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,513
With all the contributions
people sent in for Joe...

931
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:26,156
we were able to buy a beautiful land
preserve that's even big enough for him.

932
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,036
We dedicated the Joe Young
Wildlife Park today...

933
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,391
and it was one of
the happiest days of my life.

934
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,513
At last, l have kept my promise
to my mother.

935
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,916
The people here are saying N'Gai Zamu,
the sacred guardian...

936
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,918
has returned
to protect the mountains.

937
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:01,238
Other people still say
N'Gai Zamu is just a legend.

938
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,557
l say legends live forever.
