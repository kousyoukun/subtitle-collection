1
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,185
Hey, fella.

2
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:58,983
Ain't you Dan Roman?

3
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,109
Yeah.

4
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:05,696
I heard you whistling
and I said to myself,

5
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,818
only one guy does that just so.

6
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,326
I'd know that
ugly face of yours anywhere.

7
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,081
But you don't remember me, I bet you.

8
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,916
Sure I do. Ben Sneed.

9
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,914
I thought you'd be milking cows
somewhere on your own...

10
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:21,873
I mean, I thought you'd quit flying.

11
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,757
I thought you'd stay away
from these things.

12
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:30,923
They're only a hunk of metal.
They don't go no place in particular.

13
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,729
I guess I just haven't got
much willpower, Ben.

14
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:36,850
-What are you up to?
-Crew chiefing with Far East.

15
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,605
It's a good job.

16
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,154
I gotta go, Dan.

17
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:52,657
-I just thought I'd say hello.
-Sure. Good luck.

18
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,686
-Either one of you know that man?
-Sure looks old for a copilot.

19
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:22,352
-Didn't know we were so hard up.
-He weren't always a copilot.

20
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,021
We used to call him "Whistling Dan."

21
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,607
One of the finest men you'd ever know.

22
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:31,860
And the most miserable. He was
down in Colombia same time I was.

23
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,869
He's taking off one night
with a full load

24
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,040
and one of them South American
line squalls

25
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,327
decided to hit the field at the same time.

26
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:42,998
The wind shifts too late for him to stop
and he don't quite make it over

27
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,711
a little hill at the end of the field.

28
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:46,883
I remember that one.
Right after the war, right?

29
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:50,547
Yeah. Dan hits flap,
but the ship breaks in half

30
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:52,971
and there's nothing but fire
in 10 seconds.

31
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:55,141
Dan gets tossed
through the cockpit window

32
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,355
and only gets a few scratches
plus that game leg of his.

33
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:02,724
Which leaves him alive to blame
himself. Everybody else gets killed.

34
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,734
Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.

35
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,904
It don't work out quite that way.

36
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,033
I knew two of the passengers.
They were off to the coast for a holiday.

37
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:16,405
Blonde girl, name of Mary
and a little boy, name of Tony.

38
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:20,119
Everybody thought
they were wonderful people,

39
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,713
including Dan Roman.

40
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:28,554
Mary was Dan's wife
and little Tony was his only kid.

41
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:31,838
Yup.

42
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,061
Dan is the only guy I ever knew who
had guts enough not to commit suicide.

43
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:56,032
Flight 21 now arriving,
Gate 1, from Los Angeles.

44
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:08,959
Miss Betty Emsley,
please report to the information desk.

45
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,890
Nice to have you with us, Mr. Flaherty.
Please check with immigration now.

46
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,187
You'll board in about 30 minutes.

47
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:26,228
This is Miss Spalding, your stewardess.

48
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,529
-I'll be in the bar.
-We'll call you, Mr. Flaherty.

49
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:37,071
Trouble.

50
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,420
-Mr. and Mrs. Joseph?
-Yes, sirree.

51
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,216
The Waikiki kids. Just put us down
as a float for the Rose Bowl parade.

52
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:52,968
-Your age, Mr. Joseph?
-Today?

53
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:56,266
No, I'm 38, so help me.

54
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:58,680
-Birthplace?
-Passaic, New Jersey.

55
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:01,518
That's the Garden State.
Motto. Liberty and prosperity.

56
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:03,975
Bounded on the north by New York,
on the south by...

57
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,322
-And Mrs. Joseph?
-Shall I tell him? I'm 33,

58
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,946
and I was born in Ogden, Utah.

59
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:14,358
Thank you, immensely.

60
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:15,617
Aloha.

61
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,462
-Hey, look. Remember?
-Yeah.

62
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:33,260
My name is Sally McKee.
I'm 30 years old.

63
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,264
I was born in Riverside, California.

64
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:39,887
-You're still a United States citizen?
-Yes, of course.

65
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:43,439
Thank you, Miss McKee.
Please check with immigration.

66
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:48,062
Your flight will be announced.

67
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:52,446
She may be put together
with paste and flour,

68
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:55,530
but that woman has something.
What would you say it was?

69
00:07:55,663 --> 00:07:58,415
Practice. Plenty of practice.

70
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,128
-Aren't you...
-Yes, I'm Gustave Pardee.

71
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,998
I've enjoyed your New York shows
very much.

72
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,247
Good. Delighted.

73
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,628
Here are our tickets.

74
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,595
I'm 47 and I was born in New York City.

75
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,258
Mrs. Pardee?

76
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:16,179
I'm 30,
and I was born in Owosso, Michigan.

77
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:20,853
-How will the weather be?
-Fine, Mr. Pardee.

78
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,020
You should have a very pleasant trip.

79
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,946
He looks like a tired walrus on a rock.

80
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:33,822
She looks like she's done all right
for a slender redhead from Owosso.

81
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:38,613
-Ken Childs, 53. Born in Philadelphia.
-Yes, Mr. Childs.

82
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:41,915
I don't know where my luggage is. The
Royal was supposed to send it down.

83
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,454
We'll check right into it, sir.

84
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,959
May I introduce your stewardess,
Miss Spalding.

85
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,714
Hello, sister. New here, aren't you?

86
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,834
Four months now with the company,
Mr. Childs.

87
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:53,503
Good. I don't know where they get
some of the girls

88
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,716
but things are improving.

89
00:08:57,101 --> 00:09:00,220
One of the few men who has ever made
any real money out of aviation.

90
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:03,189
He's one of our stockholders.
Treat him accordingly.

91
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,520
If you please.

92
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:08,193
-Dorothy Chen?
-Yes.

93
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:14,529
-Born in Antung, Manchuria?
-Yes, but I am Korean.

94
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,366
You have your passport handy,
of course.

95
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,207
Please take it to immigration.
It's just over there.

96
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,790
It's a real pleasure
to have you with us, Miss Chen.

97
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,165
Thank you, sir.

98
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:31,218
-That face.
-A moon and a willow tree.

99
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:37,013
West Airlines,
Flight 7 from San Francisco,

100
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,766
now arriving, Gate 11.

101
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:43,643
I'm sorry I'm late, Skipper. I got hung up
buying a present for my wife.

102
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:46,437
Susie will sure be excited
when she sees this.

103
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:47,807
Yeah.

104
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:50,400
I already been up to Weather.
The winds aren't too bad.

105
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,728
Let's try 9,000 for a change.

106
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,941
I'll have a flight plan
in 15 minutes, Skipper.

107
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,068
I hope Susie likes this tray.

108
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:02,783
3,050 gallons be all right
for takeoff, Captain?

109
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:05,491
Sounds all right,
let's see what Leonard says.

110
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,960
It looks about 12 hours and 16 minutes,

111
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,750
if these winds
are anywhere near correct.

112
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:11,840
Okay, 30-50 takeoff.

113
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:15,088
West Airlines,
Flight 7 from San Francisco

114
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,049
now arriving, Gate 11.

115
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,934
Say, Skipper, how old would you say
Dan Roman is?

116
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,851
He was flying planes before I was born.
Look at it yourself.

117
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:30,141
He flew the airmail
in the open-cockpit days.

118
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,984
I think he learned to fly
in the first World War.

119
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,443
And endurance flights, racing,
old-time barnstorming.

120
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:38,986
Ten or 15 years with Transworld.

121
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,282
In the second World War, he flew
a bomber in the Ploiesti oilfield raid.

122
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,624
He took his cracks at Germany
in B-17s,

123
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,249
finally wound up with a B-29 squad
into Okinawa.

124
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,510
I'll just lay you a bet
he's got better than 20,000 hours.

125
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,174
-It sure is embarrassing.
-What's embarrassing?

126
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:06,019
He's got so much time and all.

127
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,644
They must've been out of their heads
to hire an old fire-horse like him.

128
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,985
Why not let him graze in the pasture?

129
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:15,825
-All ready, Lennie?
-All set to sign, Skipper.

130
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,284
-All ready, Lennie?
-All set to sign, Skipper.

131
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,739
Attention, please.

132
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:22,329
Mrs. Helen Bell,
please report to the ticket office.

133
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,491
Me, too.

134
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,334
Twenty-one souls onboard.
The rest, cargo.

135
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,548
73,000 pounds gross.

136
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:37,259
I said it to Orville, I said it to Wilbur,
and I say it to you,

137
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,631
the thing will never leave the ground.

138
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,436
You may rely on Miss Spalding to take
good care of your son, Mr. Fields.

139
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,234
He's not the first young man
to cross the ocean alone.

140
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,399
It will be quite an adventure for him.

141
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:54,364
He's, unfortunately,
quite an experienced traveler.

142
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,150
His mother will meet him
in San Francisco.

143
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,988
She's brunette, and quite beautiful.

144
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:03,825
If you'll wait at Gate 4, Mr. Fields,
you may put Tobey aboard yourself.

145
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,535
Thank you.

146
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,797
Come on, Tobey, let's go.

147
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:22,678
Flight 1-4 from Los Angeles
arriving, Gate 11.

148
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:24,432
What are you looking at?

149
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:25,842
Attention, please.

150
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:34,864
You suppose it'll ever happen to me?

151
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,951
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but where can I send a cable?

152
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:39,903
Just across from the souvenir stand.

153
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,527
You're sure about our connecting
with that New York plane?

154
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:45,155
You'll make it with time to spare,
Mr. Rice.

155
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,498
We'll make it with time to spare.

156
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:51,370
That little lady had a grandfather
who left her both brains and riches.

157
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:54,424
She bought her husband
an advertising agency not long ago

158
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,129
because he wanted a new toy.

159
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,672
How do you know these things?

160
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,176
I used to be a night clerk
in a Nevada hotel.

161
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:03,012
Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.

162
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:13,018
-Mr. Locota?
-Yeah, that's me.

163
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:14,523
I'm a fisherman.

164
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:17,572
My family should be in fishermen
for a couple of hundred years,

165
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,360
maybe more, I don't know.

166
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,909
The fish, they don't school up here,

167
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,949
like on the coast of California.

168
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,455
So, I'm gonna go back
to San Francisco now.

169
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:29,665
Thank you, Mr. Locota.

170
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,871
Your plane will be announced
in a few minutes.

171
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:34,461
Don't you want us
to check that through for you?

172
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:38,340
But I got in here my things
for to eat for the trip.

173
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,140
You've hurt my feelings, Mr. Locota.

174
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,425
Did you think you wouldn't eat my lunch,

175
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,303
or the steak we're gonna have
for dinner?

176
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:48,852
Ma'am, miss,
I don't know about these things.

177
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:53,276
I never fly before. I don't want to make
no trouble for nobody.

178
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:55,728
Serving you will be a pleasure,
Mr. Locota.

179
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,239
Thank you.

180
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:03,277
Just a minute, Mr. Locota.
There you are.

181
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,539
Thank you. Excuse me very much.

182
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:12,794
You didn't know all about that little man.

183
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:15,923
The ticketing sheet had nothing on him
except statistics.

184
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:18,293
I'm afraid he falls into
the "nobody" category.

185
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:21,963
He's gonna be more
than a statistic to me. I like him.

186
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh, brother.
Will I be glad to get on that plane.

187
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:37,070
Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?

188
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:40,780
Listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.
But this place,

189
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:43,403
Coney Island with coconuts.

190
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:47,155
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take all the Hawaiian Islands...

191
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:53,877
Tobey, will you tell your mother
something for me?

192
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:59,001
Tell your mother that there shouldn't be
an ocean between us.

193
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:02,335
Tell her I wish
she'd come with you next time.

194
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:08,019
-Can you remember all that, Tobey?
-Yes, Daddy.

195
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:22,819
I got him, Daddy. I got him.

196
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:59,314
-Everything okay, Dan?
-Yeah. Everything's fine.

197
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,238
3,050 aboard.

198
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:05,867
There's a slight oil leak, Number 4.
Nothing to worry about.

199
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,574
How long does it look like?

200
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:10,541
Lennie says 12 hours
and 15 minutes, about.

201
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,159
Twelve hours and 16 minutes exactly.

202
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:17,506
Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.

203
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:22,006
San Francisco.
I must go to San Francisco.

204
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:25,139
Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.
You're not on the list.

205
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:27,472
Mr. Kenneth Childs is on your plane,
isn't he?

206
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:28,882
Why, yes. Mr. Childs...

207
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,021
Then you must have room.
I insist. I must go.

208
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,477
Very well, sir. Fortunately
we have space available today

209
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,611
-if you're an American citizen.
-I am. I am for sure.

210
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,947
My name is Humphrey Agnew.
I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.

211
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,317
Right here in Honolulu.
Perhaps you've heard?

212
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:47,944
Yes. Do you have a travel card,
Mr. Agnew?

213
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:49,623
I pay cash for everything.

214
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,785
If you'll just step across the lobby
and check with immigration,

215
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,873
then come right back here,
we'll have your ticket ready, sir.

216
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,959
Now, there goes a real quack.

217
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,666
He's made a fortune
selling Agnew's aids to better living.

218
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:03,919
What have you got?

219
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:07,341
Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness,
sticky liver?

220
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,848
Agnew has got a curing pill
for all of them.

221
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:13,477
-So long, Alsop. Have fun.
-I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.

222
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:34,869
May I take your coat, Mrs. Pardee?

223
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,834
-You all right, Mr. Locota?
-Yes.

224
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:48,433
-We going to fly very high?
-7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir,

225
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,757
depends on our clearance.

226
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,467
Wouldn't you like to sit
next to the window, Mr. Briscoe?

227
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:56,270
You know something, miss? This is
as far as the old carcass would go.

228
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,808
I'd rather look at you
than what's outside, anyhow.

229
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,566
Your seat belt isn't fastened.
Shame on you.

230
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,744
My arm just won't bend around
the way it should.

231
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:11,741
-Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.
-I don't see any holes.

232
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,533
You know something, miss?
Neither do I.

233
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,841
Would you like me to take your leis,
put them in a cool place?

234
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,051
They'll keep better.

235
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:30,348
Now, that's just about the smartest idea
anybody ever had.

236
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,304
Gotta keep them as long as we can.

237
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:36,220
Gotta get back
to the old salt mines tomorrow.

238
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,440
Get the nose to the grindstone.

239
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:42,186
That's Hawaiian for "thank you."

240
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,776
Let me tell you something.
If we get into any trouble,

241
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,734
any serious trouble
that the pilot can't handle,

242
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,409
you just come to old Ed Joseph.

243
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,625
I'll be glad to go up there and help him
if he needs me.

244
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,211
-Got it?
-Got it.

245
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:07,888
All right, young man,
it's time to get you buckled down now.

246
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,348
Just make you nice and comfy here.

247
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,934
And the next thing you know
we'll be in the air, all right?

248
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:25,146
-Mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?
-I would be so pleased.

249
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:32,993
I am so happy
you wish to sit next to me,

250
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:37,040
because I have been watching you
walk down the aisle

251
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:40,042
and have the desire
to say a thing to you.

252
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,841
It is that you are
the first real, alive American girl

253
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,427
I have ever greeted in person.

254
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:52,394
You are so very beautiful.

255
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:56,187
I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one

256
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,973
if all the girls in America

257
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:02,652
are so beautiful and kind.

258
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:05,982
I don't think you're going to
have to worry about a thing.

259
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,610
Off.

260
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,490
-Wing flaps.
-Fifteen degrees.

261
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,284
-Mixture.
-Auto rich.

262
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,042
V1 and V2 speeds?

263
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:20,372
112, 116, that about does it.

264
00:20:20,506 --> 00:20:22,545
-Check the radios, Dan?
-Yeah.

265
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:25,005
420 ready for takeoff.

266
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,716
Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.

267
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,236
When you have time, I wish you'd come
back and talk to one of my passengers.

268
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,445
All right.

269
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:12,149
He's a Mr. Pardee,
big rumpled-looking man,

270
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:13,864
sitting halfway back on the right side.

271
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:16,618
Alsop said he had something to do
with the New York theatre.

272
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,540
I suppose he wants to put you
on the stage.

273
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,411
Call me
if you need your honor defended.

274
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:23,036
And jump from the frying pan
into the fire?

275
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:25,165
He's the original frightened Freddie.

276
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,214
Every time you bank or change
propeller pitch, he goes all white.

277
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:31,717
Grabs on his seat
like it was an electric chair.

278
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:33,342
Okay.

279
00:22:37,604 --> 00:22:39,395
I thought you were
going to quit smoking.

280
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:42,192
I did. I haven't smoked
in three hours and 20 minutes.

281
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,060
Go ahead, stain your teeth.

282
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,238
Come see me when you grow up, junior.

283
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,233
What in the world are you
bawling about?

284
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,897
Have I done something to bring this on?

285
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,534
-Nell, cut it out.
-I'm trying to.

286
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,622
I just can't.

287
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,504
It's just, it's all over.

288
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,958
What's over?

289
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,290
Our honeymoon.

290
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,184
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

291
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,854
Of course it does. It's not over
for another 12 hours or so.

292
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,477
And it never has to be
as far as I'm concerned.

293
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,688
Oh, Milo.

294
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:03,950
I'm scared.

295
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,042
I'm just plain scared.

296
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,709
What are you scared of? We've got
the whole world in front of us.

297
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,550
It's just that we're so young.

298
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,591
And just like you said,

299
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:21,599
we've got that whole big world
down there.

300
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,556
-And you know what?
-What?

301
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,392
We've got to face it.

302
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,900
I thought you had confidence in me.

303
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,570
Of course I do.

304
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,077
It's just that

305
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,543
all the rest of the people in the world
don't know you like I do.

306
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:54,798
Supposing I was going to have a baby
and you didn't have a job?

307
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,554
-You're not supposed...
-Suppose I was?

308
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:57,761
All right.

309
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,341
You're going to have a baby
and I haven't got a job,

310
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,933
there's no food in the apartment,
it's snowing outside,

311
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,435
and the sheriff's knocking on the door...

312
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,776
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

313
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,792
-Are you?
-Am I what?

314
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,335
Are you...

315
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:31,581
You know.

316
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,051
-Me?
-You.

317
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,639
Oh, Milo. No.

318
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:44,600
Whatever gave you such an idea?

319
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:47,566
I don't know.

320
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:12,693
Prof. Flaherty. Welcome.

321
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,315
Are we to believe
you are at last resolved

322
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:19,118
to abandon the arts
and return to science?

323
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:22,570
If so, we rejoice.

324
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,699
We have sorely missed your help
and advice.

325
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,166
You're doing all right.

326
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:32,872
You'll find out how to blow up the world
all by your little selves.

327
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,214
It won't be long now and blooie.
Congratulations.

328
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:42,264
Professor, we all appreciate the fact
that you've been under enormous strain.

329
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,683
We deeply regret
that a man of your caliber

330
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,267
no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.

331
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:48,512
Cooperate?

332
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,438
I had a seat on a nice little campus

333
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:54,605
even if I wasn't making much money,

334
00:28:54,738 --> 00:28:57,609
or my students didn't know
what I was talking about.

335
00:28:57,825 --> 00:28:59,782
And I played pretty good golf

336
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:02,326
and I slept nights.

337
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:05,831
I was happy because I figured
it was still God's business

338
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,081
to monkey around with the universe.

339
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:11,996
He can fix a star
so it'll burn for a billion years.

340
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:16,625
Keep going and you'll find out
how to burn one up in a minute.

341
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,429
Did any of you ever bother
to look at the lagoon out there?

342
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:24,266
It's beautiful and blue,

343
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,853
and the people around it
are brown and kind

344
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:30,597
and they did know
how to laugh and sing.

345
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:34,611
Only now all the fishes
in the lagoon are dead.

346
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,646
And the people are scared forever.

347
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:40,116
They don't sing anymore.

348
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:42,908
You found a way to blow out a window

349
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:46,122
65 miles away from the impact point.

350
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:47,780
Only, suppose there's a mother

351
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:50,669
standing in that window
with a baby in her arms?

352
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,216
Professor,

353
00:29:56,384 --> 00:29:59,504
I suggest you go to your tent
and rest for a while.

354
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:05,301
I'll arrange transport back to the States
for you at the earliest possible moment.

355
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,185
Yeah, do that.

356
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,765
I want to find a shepherd in the hills
or a mountain in the mist,

357
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:15,110
and paint their picture

358
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,857
before it's too late.

359
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,878
So, you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

360
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:41,919
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

361
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,513
I've made almost 200 flights
across here

362
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,560
and I feel a lot safer
than if I were driving my car.

363
00:30:49,272 --> 00:30:52,391
I've got a lovely wife and two kids,
another on the way.

364
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:55,016
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was safe.

365
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,070
You hedged, Captain.
You didn't answer my question.

366
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,236
Come now,

367
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:03,901
be a good honest fellow
and tell me exactly what frightened you?

368
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:11,532
They were technical incidents. I don't
think you'd understand, Mr. Pardee.

369
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,247
I understand perfectly.

370
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:15,919
For some reason,
you were afraid you wouldn't reach

371
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,876
your Biblical span of life.

372
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,927
Which is precisely what's bothering me
at the moment.

373
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:24,090
I'm convinced I couldn't swim
from here to the nearest shore.

374
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:26,098
You won't have to swim, Mr. Pardee.

375
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:28,598
Suppose one of your motors
ceases to function?

376
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:32,263
We'd just go back to Honolulu. These
ships fly beautifully on three engines.

377
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,771
If it should happen
beyond our point of no return

378
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,728
we'd simply continue
on to San Francisco.

379
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,278
Suppose two of your motors
became uninterested in further toil?

380
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:43,201
Each engine is entirely independent
of the other.

381
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:47,241
The chances of two quitting during the
same flight are one in several million.

382
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,661
Even if that should happen,
we could still fly,

383
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,831
lower and much slower,
but we'd get there.

384
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,338
You are very reassuring.
Why is it I read about so many crashes?

385
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,669
The newspapers always exaggerate
the importance of an air accident.

386
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:04,377
It would be very important to me
if I were in one.

387
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:06,175
You won't be, Mr. Pardee.

388
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:09,888
Just relax. Enjoy your flight.

389
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:14,855
Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you
for just a minute.

390
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:19,436
It can only be a minute,
then I'll have to go back to work.

391
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,774
I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.

392
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,577
I used to work in reservations
for Pan American.

393
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:28,369
That's fine. I'm glad you decided
to try a flight with us.

394
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:31,369
Aren't there two exits to this plane?
One up forward,

395
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:33,125
where you
and the rest of the crew leave?

396
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,415
Yes.

397
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,714
Could I leave the plane that way?
With you and the crew?

398
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,293
Please, it's very important to me.

399
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:46,255
It's not what you're thinking.
I am going to be met in San Francisco,

400
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:49,926
but not by the police or anybody else
who could get you into trouble.

401
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,935
It just wouldn't work.

402
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,244
Confused, Captain?

403
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:16,701
Why, no. That's you.

404
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:21,006
It was me, eight years ago.

405
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,843
A fellow in the States saw that picture.

406
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:27,880
He wrote me.

407
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:31,267
I was lonely, so I answered.

408
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:35,813
There were a lot of letters,

409
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,270
beautiful letters.

410
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:42,191
And then last month,
I agreed to marry him.

411
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:49,368
I never got around to telling him
the picture was eight years old.

412
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,494
I don't want to bore you
with my troubles,

413
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:58,127
but that dream kept me sane
for a long time.

414
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,290
I know I'm a

415
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:06,253
mess.

416
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:11,843
I'm so much older than he thinks I am.

417
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:15,142
But

418
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,605
if I could just see him

419
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:23,652
and then leave without meeting him.

420
00:34:25,993 --> 00:34:27,784
Please understand, Captain.

421
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:37,868
What you're asking
is not exactly in my line.

422
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:42,793
Let me think it over. I'll let you know.

423
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,943
-Newspaper?
-No, thanks.

424
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:11,321
-How's AT&T?
-It's up a point.

425
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:16,624
I hope you don't mind,
I couldn't help watching you.

426
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:20,829
You remind me so much of a man
I once knew.

427
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:24,627
My name is Ken Childs
and I don't mind at all.

428
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,789
Fourteen minutes behind
on the last fix, Skipper.

429
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:57,998
So?

430
00:35:58,128 --> 00:36:00,833
We should make it up.
The wind seems to be shifting around.

431
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:02,079
Good.

432
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:06,295
You know it's nice having
a guy like Dan Roman up here.

433
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,139
For a change,
I don't feel like a grandfather.

434
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:11,721
I was just saying to my wife
the other day,

435
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,510
I never had it so good.

436
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:15,934
Easy job, no strain,

437
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:19,440
and I'm pretty lucky in having
a girl like Susie.

438
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:23,477
It makes all the difference in the world
what kind of a wife a guy has.

439
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,404
Don't you think so, Skipper?

440
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:30,202
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

441
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:30,320
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

442
00:36:30,828 --> 00:36:33,865
I guess a lot of people
do think it's funny,

443
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:36,745
because I do the dishes
and the cooking, too,

444
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:40,087
but they forget
how much younger Susie is than I am.

445
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:44,086
And as for an extra martini
once in a while...

446
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:47,087
And so you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

447
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:49,879
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

448
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:54,641
...it's spirit.
You know, she once called me...

449
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:56,014
Are you?

450
00:36:57,856 --> 00:37:01,640
Are you now, for no reason at all...

451
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:05,228
You wait till you see what she does
with that hardwood tray I bought her.

452
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:07,736
...after almost 2 million miles...

453
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:09,906
...maybe beside the little bar
she bought...

454
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:11,114
...afraid?

455
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:13,036
...to keep herself company
while I'm away.

456
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:15,037
She'll show it to everyone
who drops in

457
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,956
to keep her company when I'm away.

458
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,544
But it's there.

459
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,672
It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.

460
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,300
You can almost touch it.

461
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:29,837
She spent most of her time
riding around in it

462
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:31,632
so she wouldn't get too lonesome.

463
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,016
Guess she drove a little too fast...

464
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:37,808
It's come like it has to so many others
for no reason at all...

465
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:39,178
And besides...

466
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:42,600
...except maybe the wear and tear
of those 2 million miles.

467
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:45,903
...because they look like they're going
faster than they really are.

468
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,066
Like what the bartender told me
last December

469
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,940
when she was picked up
for being drunk in and about...

470
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:54,236
They'll give you a certificate
for those 2 million miles

471
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,495
to hang on a wall at home.

472
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,869
Only, the certificate doesn't add up
to the wear and tear.

473
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:04,338
...but the wrong word.
It's spirit she's got.

474
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,378
Dan knows about it.

475
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,598
All the old timers say
it's only temporary,

476
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,016
like growing pains.

477
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:17,226
Like this note she left me
on my last trip.

478
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:20,723
And now, it's here for no reason at all,

479
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,893
and you've got to fight it,

480
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,351
all alone.

481
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,068
"Welcome home, fatso.

482
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:32,034
"Got sleepy and couldn't wait
so you take a taxi.

483
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:35,701
"Don't make any racket when you come
home banging around the kitchen,

484
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:39,247
"and don't wake me up
in the morning. Love, Susie."

485
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,962
What a sense of humor.

486
00:38:45,632 --> 00:38:48,337
Someday, they're going to invent
a stool for navigators

487
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:51,386
that'll come somewhere near
fitting the human frame.

488
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:56,052
Ask Hobie if he can't synchronize
the props a little better.

489
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:58,391
I don't know
whether it's Number 1 or Number 3,

490
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,640
but one of them keeps slipping out.
It's getting on my nerves.

491
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:02,888
Okay.

492
00:39:04,193 --> 00:39:05,853
Skipper says,
"What's the matter with you?

493
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:07,315
"Can't you keep the props together?"

494
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,821
They are together.

495
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:10,942
Skipper says they're out of phase.

496
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:13,114
One and 2 are as smooth as silk.

497
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:15,699
-So are 3 and 4.
-So be it.

498
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,449
The boys say the props
couldn't be smoother.

499
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:23,916
Yeah?

500
00:39:25,548 --> 00:39:27,505
Well, there's something haywire.

501
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:43,271
Are you all right, Mr. Briscoe?

502
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:44,771
All right?

503
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:48,319
Little girl,
I'm getting along like $10 million.

504
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:51,400
Can I get you something?

505
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:54,024
Perhaps a cup of tea
would taste good to you.

506
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:59,290
-What was that?
-It's 5:00.

507
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,250
-You mean it chimes?
-You heard it.

508
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:06,542
Funny thing. It happens to be
the last possession

509
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:09,247
I haven't signed over to someone else.

510
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,794
I wish it would chime again.

511
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:15,682
What a wonderful way
to keep track of the time.

512
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:19,141
If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait
for the next hour to come,

513
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:20,467
and then the next one.

514
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:23,439
You know something?
I used to feel the same way.

515
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:27,065
But right now I'm in no hurry
for the hours to pass.

516
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:32,229
No, the watch is yours.
I want you to have it.

517
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,822
-I couldn't think of accepting it.
-Please.

518
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:37,621
A watch is the last thing
I'm going to need.

519
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:40,660
I'd like to think of it
marking the kind of hours

520
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,665
only a young girl can have,

521
00:40:42,835 --> 00:40:44,163
exciting hours.

522
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:47,214
You'll make me very happy
if you'll accept it.

523
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,707
Well, if you put it that way.

524
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:51,885
I can't thank you.

525
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:54,756
I've never met anyone like you,

526
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,558
yet I shall remember you
for the rest of my life.

527
00:40:57,683 --> 00:41:00,803
I'd rather you remember
it's only a possession

528
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:03,143
and so, not worth very much.

529
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:05,182
I will, always.

530
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:10,025
We can hear it chime together again,
it needs setting, you know.

531
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,862
-It's 7:00 in San Francisco.
-Sure. I forgot.

532
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:26,375
Is it really 7:00, little girl?

533
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:28,213
As far as this airplane is concerned.

534
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,460
Then you know something?
I don't want tea or coffee.

535
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:34,465
-A glass of water?
-Water is for bathing,

536
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:37,717
but if you can put some Scotch in it,
I'll feel cleaner.

537
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:38,929
Yes, sir.

538
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,052
-It's way past my cocktail time.
-Right now.

539
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:44,389
How about my friend over there?
Will you join me for a drink, mister?

540
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:47,144
Yes, thank you very much.

541
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:53,402
That's awful nice music.

542
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:02,301
We picked up four minutes, Skipper.

543
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:05,804
Looks like that wind
is finally swinging around now.

544
00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:07,018
Good.

545
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:11,644
I may pass a miracle
and hit San Francisco right on time.

546
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:15,152
-Have a Lifesaver, Skipper?
-No, thanks.

547
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:20,408
Let me know, will you, when we pass
the point of no return?

548
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:24,905
Naturally.

549
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:51,437
Lydia, if you're through pouting,

550
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:54,737
maybe we could try talking things over
in a reasonable manner.

551
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:57,023
We have nothing to talk over.

552
00:43:57,158 --> 00:44:00,159
Anyone who would sell
a New York advertising agency

553
00:44:00,286 --> 00:44:02,777
-for a broken-down mine in Canada...
-It isn't broken.

554
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:06,081
...just to make yourself feel important,
the big operator.

555
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:07,746
Operating on my money.

556
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:11,496
I just want to get up with the feeling
that anything I accomplish that day

557
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:13,125
is due to my own efforts.

558
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:15,879
Not because my wife happened
to inherit a business.

559
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:18,881
In three years I should be able
to pay you back. Every penny.

560
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:22,465
Three years in the wilderness
and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin

561
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:25,886
with my skirts around my ankles
when they ought to be around my knees

562
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:28,144
or the other way around.

563
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,438
For the last time, Lydia,
I'm asking you to come with me.

564
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,939
I'm glad it's the last time you're going
to make that insane request

565
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,031
so I won't have to say no again.

566
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:41,734
I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.

567
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,246
You're out of your head.

568
00:44:43,372 --> 00:44:45,578
What am I supposed to do
while you clump around

569
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,368
in your boots and lumberjack shirt?

570
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:51,629
Have cocktails with the chipmunks?
Play bridge with the Eskimos?

571
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:55,465
Go on off to your primeval forest.
Play Daniel Boone,

572
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:59,009
get up with the pigeons or whatever
kind of birds they have up there.

573
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:00,632
Get calluses on your hands.

574
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,386
Be a great
dirt-under-the-fingernails boy.

575
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:06,684
Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.

576
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:10,064
Take a bath Saturday nights
and go to an Eskimo hoedown.

577
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:11,934
Teach them to samba, for all I care.

578
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:15,484
Do just as you please
if it will make you feel like a man.

579
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,817
Only don't ask me to share
your juvenile adventures.

580
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:21,359
It's bad enough having to pay for them.

581
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:25,202
-Is that your last word?
-No.

582
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:29,789
I've always felt your brain
would fit nicely in a demitasse.

583
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:37,002
Hey, fella.
You got nothing but trouble, right?

584
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,296
-I assure you...
-I know what you're going to say,

585
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,672
everything with you is hunky-dory.

586
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:45,762
That's the first thing a fella
in trouble always says.

587
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:50,012
The booby hatches are full of people
that keep things to themselves,

588
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,271
either because they're scared
to tell them the truth,

589
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:55,105
thinking they'll make a monkey
out of themselves,

590
00:45:55,237 --> 00:45:58,072
or they figure no one else can
appreciate the situation they're in.

591
00:45:58,198 --> 00:45:59,032
Okay?

592
00:45:59,032 --> 00:45:59,447
Okay?

593
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,617
Well, the Good Neighbors
believe that ain't so.

594
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,370
-And just who...
-A club I belong to back home.

595
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:09,625
It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.

596
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:12,246
Their luncheons are a riot.

597
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:16,004
Over the speaker's desk,
they've got a great big towel

598
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:19,882
with the letters "For Crying Out Loud"
embroidered on it.

599
00:46:20,262 --> 00:46:23,098
And every member
has his own crying towel, get it?

600
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:27,560
When they bring in a bad case,
a couple of the Good Neighbors

601
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:31,221
hold the towel for the fella
so he can concentrate on weeping,

602
00:46:31,357 --> 00:46:34,441
and then don't have to exert himself
in any other way.

603
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:39,071
It turns out to be a good
old-fashioned revival meeting

604
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:43,157
and the fella who has
no particular worries at the time,

605
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:46,282
he sort of feels left out of things.

606
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:51,248
And if this fella don't actually wind up
laughing at himself,

607
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,037
at least he feels better.

608
00:46:53,421 --> 00:46:55,710
The main thing is, everybody does,

609
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:58,125
because nine times out of 10,

610
00:46:58,259 --> 00:47:01,296
they think they're better off
than the other fella.

611
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,013
What do you sing at the end
of your meetings?

612
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:07,467
Pack Up Your Troubles
in Your Old Kit Bag?

613
00:47:07,602 --> 00:47:08,883
How'd you guess?

614
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:11,845
When a fella comes in
with real trouble,

615
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:14,021
like he can't pay his income taxes,

616
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:17,021
or his wife just smashed up the car,

617
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:22,491
or his new house
shows cracks along the foundation,

618
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:28,247
they've got an organ that plays
real sad music.

619
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:30,082
It's a kick.

620
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:32,209
I can see how it might be.

621
00:47:32,461 --> 00:47:35,628
Of course, a fella never comes in

622
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:37,923
with real troubles.

623
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:39,379
You know, like,

624
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,835
the guy's wife dying,

625
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:45,255
or his business really going broke.

626
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:48,013
They just confess little problems,

627
00:47:48,144 --> 00:47:51,394
like who are they gonna get
to mow the lawn,

628
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:54,725
or will they ever break 100
on the golf course?

629
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:56,893
It's all relative, see.

630
00:47:57,403 --> 00:48:01,187
You get the habit of laughing
at little problems

631
00:48:01,324 --> 00:48:02,948
when they come along,

632
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:05,115
and then you don't blow your top

633
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:09,112
when the genuine,
serious things happen. Get it?

634
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,038
Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, Mr...

635
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:15,743
Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.

636
00:48:17,006 --> 00:48:20,956
Getting back to your case,
maybe it'd make you feel better

637
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:22,802
if I cried some.

638
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:27,303
Then you'd understand
what the Good Neighbor means.

639
00:48:30,437 --> 00:48:32,809
Imagine yourself with a towel.

640
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:39,560
Ready?

641
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:43,491
The wife and I scrimped
for over four years

642
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:45,408
to take a trip to Hawaii.

643
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:50,614
You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand,

644
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,410
things we ain't got at home.

645
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:58,544
We dreamed of the day
that we were to leave.

646
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:02,719
So, the wife persuades a woman
to take care of our children

647
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:04,469
for $10 a day,

648
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:08,760
which is more than I made
the first five years we were married.

649
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:15,439
We got all unpacked
and were really living,

650
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,526
but the ship don't sail.
Strike or something.

651
00:49:20,655 --> 00:49:24,355
But all right, we're lucky. We get
the last two tickets on an airplane,

652
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:26,900
and although we can't take
all our luggage,

653
00:49:27,036 --> 00:49:29,243
we're in the land of our dreams.

654
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:32,369
At the little hotel that fits our budget,

655
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:34,534
there's a mix-up in the reservations.

656
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:37,753
Another couple named Joseph
from Milwaukee.

657
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,047
So we figure
maybe they've had a dream, too.

658
00:49:41,176 --> 00:49:43,299
So we don't start any arguments.

659
00:49:46,055 --> 00:49:49,555
We finally wind up at a hotel
which is way beyond our budget.

660
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,428
So we have to cut our trip short.

661
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:58,230
Okay? Comes evening,

662
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,396
the wife gets into the one evening dress
she could bring along

663
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,531
and I get into a tux
I haven't had on in 10 years.

664
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:13,656
Mommy!

665
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:23,089
We were ready for the light fantastic.

666
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,885
The wife was wearing new shoes

667
00:50:25,012 --> 00:50:27,966
with heels much higher
than she was used to and...

668
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:34,432
My back.

669
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:41,351
The house doctor says the wife
has twisted her sacroiliac,

670
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:44,150
which ends the dancing for the trip.

671
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:55,457
So everything passes.

672
00:50:55,668 --> 00:50:59,417
In a couple of days the wife is well
enough to hobble down to the beach.

673
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:14,769
It rains bullfrogs for three straight days.

674
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:18,141
All we got to do is sit around
and write postcards back home

675
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,110
about what a wonderful time
we're having.

676
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:31,203
Three days we got left,
then we meet the Wilsons.

677
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:34,533
One of the pleasures of any trip
should be the people you meet, right?

678
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:37,418
The Wilsons had their own ideas
of what was fun.

679
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:41,756
He thought my wife was his dish,
and she thought I was Clark Gable.

680
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,492
The wife can't run very fast
on account of her sacroiliac.

681
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,280
I'm having my own track meet.

682
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,906
Fella, you have never lived

683
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:21,662
until you've been chased around
the palm tree by that guy's wife.

684
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:27,299
So we spend the rest of our dream trip
eating away from the hotel

685
00:52:27,428 --> 00:52:31,473
so we don't run into these people
and have to play post office all the time.

686
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,888
But the last day the sun comes out.

687
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:38,554
Whoever heard of coming home
from a dream trip without a tan?

688
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:43,518
We're desperate, see?
We really soaked up that sun, all day.

689
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,161
The wife has a third-degree burn
on her shoulders.

690
00:52:53,914 --> 00:52:57,034
I don't dare put any weight on my back.

691
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,415
I'm gonna have to borrow money
from the bank

692
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:03,245
to pay next month's food bill,
if we ever do get home.

693
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:08,135
If you still think you got troubles,
mister...

694
00:53:11,765 --> 00:53:15,181
Wonder if you and Mrs. Joseph
would care to join me in a drink?

695
00:53:16,937 --> 00:53:19,309
You can have your towel back now.

696
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:42,957
Take a breather, Dan.
I'll turn the knobs awhile.

697
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:45,959
Good, I could use a little shuteye.

698
00:53:47,218 --> 00:53:52,129
Funny thing how a fella can sleep with
four big engines hollering in his ears,

699
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:55,971
only wake up when they stop hollering.

700
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:59,099
Imagine silence
waking you up at home?

701
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:03,434
No human being should have to put up
with such an arrangement.

702
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:30,171
San Francisco tollsman, 2930.

703
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:32,510
I don't care if you did build
that radio yourself.

704
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:33,920
It's against the law.

705
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:35,682
Throw it overboard before I do.

706
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:40,305
But I like to listen to the airplanes.
I spent a long time building that set.

707
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:44,522
You touch my set and I'll kill you.
I might do it anyway.

708
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:47,654
Just to have something happen
on this rust bucket.

709
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,864
You're going off your rocker.
You need six months ashore.

710
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:55,364
Being shipmates with you is enough
to drive anybody off their rocker.

711
00:54:55,496 --> 00:54:57,038
Get out of here.

712
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:01,001
Don't say I didn't warn you.

713
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:02,835
The FCC will jerk your license
in a minute

714
00:55:02,962 --> 00:55:05,287
if you send anything on that pile of junk.

715
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:06,621
Get out of here.

716
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:10,458
Hello, Honolulu.
This is 420 with a position report.

717
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:12,967
Come on, Honolulu. Wake up.
Answer him.

718
00:55:13,097 --> 00:55:15,256
420, this is San Francisco,

719
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,178
Honolulu unable to read you
on account of poor conditions.

720
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,978
Go ahead with your report.

721
00:55:20,104 --> 00:55:23,224
Okay, San Francisco. Copy, Honolulu.

722
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:25,564
Position at 0557.

723
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:27,816
Latitude 34/30 north.

724
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:31,898
Longitude 140 west, 9, 000 feet.

725
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:34,823
1, 500 gallons remaining.

726
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:56,257
From the window at my side,
sometimes I can see the stars.

727
00:55:57,267 --> 00:56:00,683
America is all around me in every way.

728
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:09,351
Do you understand a funny thing?

729
00:56:09,697 --> 00:56:12,614
In Honolulu, I must be inspected

730
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:16,656
by the American customs
and immigration persons.

731
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:20,117
And not one soldier to guard things.

732
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:25,168
I look everywhere for soldiers
with guns and...

733
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:28,623
Would you like your dinner now,
Miss Chen?

734
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:32,127
Yes. Please, I am so stupid.

735
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:35,048
Here is a letter to my brother in English

736
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:37,304
and I cannot remember this word.

737
00:56:38,017 --> 00:56:42,015
It is that thing soldiers wear
at the end of their guns,

738
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:43,684
like a sword?

739
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:45,475
-Bayonet?
-Yes.

740
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:49,311
I am so very stupid. Thank you.

741
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:51,607
I am embarrassed.

742
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:54,277
Anyone who can write and read
more than one language

743
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:55,987
should never be embarrassed.

744
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:58,990
Being the original dumb-bunny,
I can barely write my own.

745
00:56:59,122 --> 00:57:00,153
"Dumb-bunny"?

746
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,457
That's slang for mentally-retarded
American girls like me.

747
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:05,169
Dumb-bunny.

748
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:10,416
How delightful.
I must tell my brother of this.

749
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:13,672
You tell him you met the number one
stupid rabbit.

750
00:57:13,804 --> 00:57:16,342
If he knows any American girls,
he'll understand.

751
00:57:16,473 --> 00:57:18,133
Now I'll get your dinner.

752
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:19,719
Dumb-bunny.

753
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,046
There's something very wrong
back there. The tray...

754
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:53,884
-I know.
-A whole tray jumped.

755
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:56,882
-I burned myself.
-I swear it's that Number 1 engine.

756
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,510
It was running perfectly. They all are.

757
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:04,676
Maybe it's in the tail. If our little girl got
burned, maybe it's worse back there.

758
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,387
Dan, take your flashlight,
have a look through the tail.

759
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,482
-Report to me as soon as you can.
-Right.

760
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,354
Leonard, take a fast fix,

761
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:14,239
let me know our position now
and every 10 minutes from now.

762
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,943
Spalding, get back to your passengers.

763
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,531
If this thing lets go again,
they'll start wondering.

764
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,497
Hobie, tell San Francisco
we're experiencing

765
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,540
some unusual vibration
and to stand by until further advised.

766
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,993
Do you want to declare an emergency?

767
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,465
No, not yet.

768
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:26,355
-Is everything all right?
-We're still in one piece.

769
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,316
I was just starting to serve
the passengers. Should I go ahead?

770
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:30,817
You might as well.

771
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,560
Sometimes these things
never do get explained.

772
00:59:43,123 --> 00:59:44,783
Say, hang up a minute, will you?

773
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,992
Tell me what's wrong
with this airplane.

774
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:50,163
-Is there something wrong with it?
-Cut it out.

775
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:53,416
Something popped so hard a while ago,
it spilled my drink.

776
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:56,803
Order another. We're not stingy.

777
00:59:57,095 --> 00:59:58,506
You won't talk?

778
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,089
I would if there was anything to say.

779
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,348
I'll make you a bet right now,
we're late getting into San Francisco.

780
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:08,386
Could be.

781
01:00:17,491 --> 01:00:18,985
-Did you find anything?
-Nope.

782
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:21,869
-What do you suppose it could it be?
-Beats me. Where are we?

783
01:00:21,995 --> 01:00:23,905
I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.

784
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:25,533
Nothing wrong with the tail.

785
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:29,533
The Number 1 head temperature has
gone up five degrees in the past hour.

786
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:33,585
San Francisco wants to know
the nature of our trouble.

787
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:35,708
Tell them if we knew,
we'd have told them.

788
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:37,586
No, don't say that. Tell them...

789
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,009
Just say we still don't know
and to keep standing by.

790
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:43,555
I got news for you guys.
We just passed the point of no return.

791
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:08,787
-Have you lost something, Mr. Agnew?
-My lighter is out of fluid.

792
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:18,106
Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship

793
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,908
and is trying to work up an appetite
for dinner.

794
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,534
I seen a crazy man act like that once.
It ain't so nice.

795
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:26,489
He's looking for trouble.

796
01:02:32,754 --> 01:02:36,668
You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?
Well, isn't that your name?

797
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:40,295
Yeah. Why?
I don't think we've met before.

798
01:02:40,428 --> 01:02:43,513
No. We've not met
because no one wanted us to.

799
01:02:45,058 --> 01:02:46,885
What can I do for you?

800
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,100
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

801
01:02:51,523 --> 01:02:53,646
Well, does that mean anything to you?

802
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:58,315
-Agnew. You're Martha's husband.
-I am.

803
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:02,985
I didn't hear you say
you were pleased to meet me.

804
01:03:03,702 --> 01:03:05,695
-Of course...
-Of course not!

805
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:11,908
Look, Mr. Agnew, this lady and I
are having a quiet drink together.

806
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:13,912
You seem to be disturbed
about something.

807
01:03:14,046 --> 01:03:16,335
Perhaps we can talk later.
If you'll excuse...

808
01:03:16,465 --> 01:03:20,000
No, you don't just snap your fingers
and send me on my way.

809
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:24,469
Mr. Agnew, I don't know what's
eating you, and frankly, I don't care.

810
01:03:24,598 --> 01:03:27,635
Why don't you go back
wherever you came from and sit down.

811
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:30,603
-Now, honey.
-This man's a nuisance.

812
01:03:30,896 --> 01:03:32,854
I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.

813
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:34,891
I must have been
an even greater nuisance

814
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:38,027
when you and my wife were scheming
to avoid me in Honolulu,

815
01:03:38,154 --> 01:03:41,190
-so you could be alone.
-You're right out of your head.

816
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:45,693
I took your wife to lunch twice
because she was a very nice girl.

817
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:49,082
And a long time ago
she happened to work for me.

818
01:03:49,248 --> 01:03:52,084
The worst crime she is guilty of
is shaking my hand.

819
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:55,834
Now stop insulting her
and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.

820
01:03:56,005 --> 01:03:58,793
I knew you'd have
some fancy explanation.

821
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:02,418
But I'm not such a fool
as you and my wife think I am.

822
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:06,214
I'm going to let you wonder
what I'm going to do.

823
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:10,181
Wonder and think and think,
as I've been doing.

824
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:13,894
I've heard about you for years
and I'm sick of the sound of your name.

825
01:04:14,065 --> 01:04:16,556
You're quite a conqueror
with the ladies, aren't you?

826
01:04:16,693 --> 01:04:18,686
That should interest you, madam.

827
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,070
-I've had enough of this.
-What's the matter with you guys?

828
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:24,405
-Hey, what's this all about?
-Easy, break it up.

829
01:04:24,534 --> 01:04:26,112
He's crazy, he's got a gun.

830
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:37,748
We're on fire!

831
01:04:41,635 --> 01:04:44,636
-Pull the bottle on it.
-Hobie, pull the bottle quick!

832
01:04:50,144 --> 01:04:53,762
-Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco.
-San Francisco 420.

833
01:04:56,817 --> 01:04:58,561
The prop! The whole prop is gone.

834
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,319
Yes, and you may lose your engine, too.

835
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:03,067
-She's off her mountings.
-Pull the other bottle, Dan.

836
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,366
-I'm starting for the water.
-San Francisco 420.

837
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:20,962
Thank you, sweet Lord.

838
01:05:21,092 --> 01:05:23,215
I don't think she's gonna burn any more.

839
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:24,969
I can't raise San Francisco. Static.

840
01:05:25,096 --> 01:05:27,172
-Try the secondary frequency.
-I've tried both.

841
01:05:27,307 --> 01:05:29,134
Use emergency.
Give them a mayday call.

842
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:30,809
-Are we going into the water?
-No.

843
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:32,975
She flies lousy
with that engine hanging down,

844
01:05:33,104 --> 01:05:34,515
but I think we can stay in the air.

845
01:05:34,648 --> 01:05:36,356
-How long to the coast?
-Six hours, about.

846
01:05:36,483 --> 01:05:39,899
But at regular cruising speed. I've not
figured it out for this sort of thing.

847
01:05:40,028 --> 01:05:41,191
Figure it!

848
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:42,436
...mayday 420.

849
01:05:43,824 --> 01:05:46,196
Mayday 420, anybody.

850
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:49,869
I got somebody. A ship.

851
01:05:49,997 --> 01:05:54,789
This is the Cristobal Trader calling 420.
I can hear you very clearly.

852
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:58,211
You passed right over me
about 20 minutes ago.

853
01:05:58,338 --> 01:06:01,505
Do you want me to relay
all your messages? Over.

854
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:05,501
Roger. Advise San Francisco
we've lost Number 1 propeller.

855
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:07,553
Fire started but is now out.

856
01:06:07,723 --> 01:06:10,095
We are now at 5,000, but sinking.

857
01:06:10,225 --> 01:06:13,226
Request they clear
all altitudes below us. Over.

858
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:15,020
Will do. Stand by.

859
01:06:16,315 --> 01:06:19,565
This is Cristobal Trader
calling San Francisco.

860
01:06:48,473 --> 01:06:51,427
Clear sea rescue from Oakland Control.

861
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,102
Right.

862
01:07:03,113 --> 01:07:05,568
Warm up the ready plane. Intercept.

863
01:07:28,889 --> 01:07:31,973
San Francisco wants to know
if you are going to ditch. Over.

864
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:33,263
Negative for now.

865
01:07:33,394 --> 01:07:36,145
What's the state of the sea
about you, just in case. Over.

866
01:07:36,272 --> 01:07:39,806
Heavy northwest swells.
We are rolling about 30 degrees.

867
01:07:39,942 --> 01:07:43,525
It's very rough.
Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.

868
01:07:43,696 --> 01:07:46,103
It's wet down here. Over.

869
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,612
Thank you, Cristobal Trader. We'll try.

870
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:50,779
Attaboy, papa.

871
01:07:56,375 --> 01:08:00,041
Some of these days, I'm gonna
get smart and go back to buttons.

872
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:02,210
-What's the poop?
-Eastbound lost a prop.

873
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,795
Had a fire but that's out.
Looks like he's headed for the drink.

874
01:08:04,926 --> 01:08:06,800
-How far out is he?
-1,000 miles maybe.

875
01:08:06,928 --> 01:08:08,339
My aching eyes!

876
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,992
This might well be my last show
and not a laugh in it.

877
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:32,824
I shouldn't have screamed,
but I was so scared.

878
01:08:32,954 --> 01:08:35,659
My own heart is just returning
from the ceiling.

879
01:08:35,999 --> 01:08:39,499
Troubles? Wait till I tell
the Good Neighbors about this.

880
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:43,085
I was almost asleep when someone
pulled the champagne cork.

881
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:44,674
This could become interesting.

882
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,505
Things were pretty interesting
before this happened.

883
01:08:47,636 --> 01:08:49,344
Two apes were trying to kill each other.

884
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:51,927
Why don't you be a good boy
and go back and sit down.

885
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:53,849
I'm sure everything will be all right.

886
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:57,060
They'll come back from the flight deck
and explain in a minute.

887
01:08:57,187 --> 01:09:00,391
I'm just gonna keep this for you
till we make San Francisco.

888
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:02,932
You can get in plenty trouble
with them things.

889
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:05,227
I'll get coffee for everyone.

890
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,402
Did you know space guns don't kill you?

891
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:12,567
No.

892
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:14,411
They just make you stiff.

893
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:29,131
You know, the funny part of all this,

894
01:09:29,262 --> 01:09:32,678
is that for the first time
in my whole life, I'm innocent.

895
01:09:33,766 --> 01:09:36,803
What I told him was the truth,
so help me.

896
01:09:46,905 --> 01:09:49,526
This is gonna cost the taxpayers
a lot of money.

897
01:09:49,658 --> 01:09:51,567
What would you have them do?
Swim home?

898
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:54,738
No Alameda, this is the Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Centre.

899
01:10:41,794 --> 01:10:43,372
-New position, Skipper!
-Name it!

900
01:10:43,504 --> 01:10:46,458
To the coast, 5 hours, 47 minutes,
if we can hold this air speed.

901
01:10:46,591 --> 01:10:49,627
-How's our fuel?
-Enough. Just.

902
01:10:50,344 --> 01:10:53,713
We'll only need about 1,150 gallons,
we've 1,300 according to my graph.

903
01:10:53,848 --> 01:10:56,635
-It's pinching things close...
-You can throw your graph away.

904
01:10:56,768 --> 01:10:59,685
-Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.
-How do you figure that?

905
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:04,024
The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons
when we lost our prop.

906
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:06,647
My guess is that when the prop left us,

907
01:11:06,778 --> 01:11:09,185
it kicked holes in the wing.
Ruptured the tank.

908
01:11:09,322 --> 01:11:13,402
We just can't make it this way.
I'll figure it up again, but the winds,

909
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:16,370
-maybe they'll change some.
-We're going into the drink.

910
01:11:16,496 --> 01:11:18,572
It's just a question of when and where.

911
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:22,657
We've got plenty of time. Let's not rush
off into the heat of the day about this.

912
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:24,870
Let's hold on a while
and see what the wind does.

913
01:11:25,005 --> 01:11:27,626
-We'll be closer to the coast.
-Water will be colder there.

914
01:11:27,758 --> 01:11:32,135
And probably rougher, but I still think we
should stretch it out as long as we can.

915
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:33,425
I'll go along with you on that.

916
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,011
It'll give us more time
to get squared away.

917
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:38,976
I want you up here with me
when we really start down.

918
01:11:39,102 --> 01:11:40,846
Meantime get everything
you can overboard.

919
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:43,815
Thousand pounds or so
will make a difference in our speed.

920
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:46,895
You want me to tell them
they're going into the drink?

921
01:11:48,362 --> 01:11:50,189
Use your own judgment.

922
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:22,182
I guess I don't have to tell you people
that we've had a little trouble.

923
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:25,807
Maybe if I explain
exactly what has happened,

924
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:28,563
you'll feel better all around.

925
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,023
I'm not gonna minimize it,

926
01:12:30,154 --> 01:12:34,152
nor will I make it any tougher
than it really is.

927
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,971
We've lost our Number 1 propeller.

928
01:12:56,932 --> 01:13:01,594
This is just one of those things
that never happens but does

929
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:04,101
once in a billion flying miles.

930
01:13:04,565 --> 01:13:07,269
We've extinguished the fire
with the carbon dioxide,

931
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:09,643
so there's no further danger from that.

932
01:13:09,778 --> 01:13:12,898
But our speed has been considerably
slowed down

933
01:13:13,073 --> 01:13:16,941
because the Number 1 motor
is partially twisted in its mountings,

934
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:19,118
causing a severe drag,

935
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:22,449
sort of like dragging your feet
in a rowboat.

936
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:29,456
I can't blame you
if you are a little scared, I am, too.

937
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:32,670
I've been flying since 1917

938
01:13:32,802 --> 01:13:36,005
and I don't like this sort of thing
any better than you do.

939
01:13:36,472 --> 01:13:38,880
However, with all that flying,
you'll notice that

940
01:13:39,016 --> 01:13:41,139
I'm still very much alive.

941
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:47,751
Now comes the hard part.

942
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:51,457
-Can you take it?
-Please, tell us everything.

943
01:13:53,259 --> 01:13:55,050
I think we all want to know.

944
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:12,939
We're really very lucky.

945
01:14:13,071 --> 01:14:16,570
That propeller could have done
a great deal more damage.

946
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:21,947
Anyway, there are several holes in
the wing, that's where our fuel is stored.

947
01:14:22,497 --> 01:14:26,365
Which means that we can't quite make
the California coast.

948
01:14:28,712 --> 01:14:30,503
Can't we go back to Honolulu?

949
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:33,964
We'd already past the point
of no return when it happened.

950
01:14:34,092 --> 01:14:37,010
We will probably have to ditch
this plane in the sea.

951
01:14:37,137 --> 01:14:39,806
We'll all be killed.

952
01:14:41,892 --> 01:14:45,475
There's just a chance that you'll only be
in the water a few minutes.

953
01:14:45,604 --> 01:14:48,605
There's a rescue plane
already on its way to intercept us.

954
01:14:48,732 --> 01:14:52,397
Before we actually have to go in
there'll probably be several more.

955
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:54,485
Some of which can land on water.

956
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:58,066
And surface vessels
will be directed toward us.

957
01:15:00,453 --> 01:15:04,201
Airplanes have gone
into the water before

958
01:15:04,373 --> 01:15:08,122
and no one received the slightest injury,
except maybe a little dampening.

959
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:10,959
Casualties come from panic.

960
01:15:11,714 --> 01:15:13,374
So you must not hurry.

961
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:17,671
Miss Spalding and our second officer,
Mr. Wheeler, will be back here with you.

962
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,927
Do exactly as they tell you.

963
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:24,215
Airplanes have been known to float
for so long that

964
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:28,302
they became a menace to navigation
and had to be sunk by gunfire.

965
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:31,357
They've been known to sink
in a few minutes, too.

966
01:15:45,206 --> 01:15:47,283
This is an inflatable life raft.

967
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:48,698
It's really a wonderful gadget.

968
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:51,160
It's got everything in it
but T-bone steaks.

969
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,462
It will hold all of you very comfortably.

970
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,295
Mr. Wheeler, our second officer,
will be in charge.

971
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:58,917
He will tell you
when to take off your shoes.

972
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,260
We don't want anybody kicking holes
in this raft.

973
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,556
Miss Spalding will show you
where the emergency rations are,

974
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:05,764
when you get hungry.

975
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,228
How're we gonna get hungry if we're
only gonna be in the raft a few minutes?

976
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,147
Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?

977
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,276
Maybe a little,
but we just don't want bad things said

978
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,072
about the service
and cuisine on this airline.

979
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:18,857
No doubt there'll be caviar.

980
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,743
It would be most arduous
if there were no caviar.

981
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,069
I'll speak to the emergency chef.

982
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:26,244
I don't think
this is anything to joke about.

983
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,781
You're wrong.
The more jokes, the better.

984
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,079
When you get in that raft,
you might even try singing.

985
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,544
I was once a fair-to-middling bass.

986
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:37,959
I can't carry a tune in a basket,
but I'm sure loud.

987
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,837
Now, this is very important.

988
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:43,807
When we actually go in,
there will be two shocks.

989
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:47,096
If you know about them in advance,
they won't frighten you.

990
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,597
The first will be hardly noticeable,
like a normal landing.

991
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:53,893
But the second may be quite severe,
so brace yourselves.

992
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:56,276
Soon after that, the lights will go out,

993
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:59,571
but Miss Spalding and Mr. Wheeler
both have flashlights.

994
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:03,152
So unfasten your seat belts
and wait for his call.

995
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:04,912
And keep calm.

996
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:07,779
Now, is there anything
you don't understand?

997
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,955
Could we send a radio message
to our families?

998
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:13,121
They were gonna meet us at the airport.
They will be standing.

999
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,627
I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy

1000
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:18,592
giving our position
and contacting the rescue plane.

1001
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:22,253
I've some important papers
in my briefcase, many years of work.

1002
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:24,013
Can I take them with me?

1003
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:26,555
Not unless you can stuff them
in your pockets.

1004
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,642
No baggage of any kind.

1005
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:30,770
Come to think about it,

1006
01:17:30,898 --> 01:17:33,649
the bottom of the sea
is the best place for them.

1007
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:38,734
And one thing more.
Now, don't get your hopes up.

1008
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:42,739
There is one chance in a thousand
that we can make the coast.

1009
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,077
This isn't possible unless there is
a marked change in the wind.

1010
01:17:46,205 --> 01:17:49,159
And according to our forecast,
it just couldn't happen.

1011
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:53,455
But it could. And the one thing
we can do right now to help matters

1012
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:57,170
is to lighten ship.
That way we'll use slightly less fuel.

1013
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:02,304
If any of you gentlemen have ever had
an urge to throw things out of windows,

1014
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:04,713
this is your chance of a lifetime.

1015
01:18:04,932 --> 01:18:07,767
What about us girls?
I love to throw things.

1016
01:18:07,894 --> 01:18:10,100
Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.

1017
01:18:12,648 --> 01:18:16,563
I'd better stick with the wife. She's
awfully worried about our children.

1018
01:18:16,986 --> 01:18:18,564
Please, let me help.

1019
01:18:18,947 --> 01:18:21,948
I'll sue the airline for this,
I'm not supposed to exert myself.

1020
01:18:22,075 --> 01:18:25,658
-The doctor says my heart...
-Your heart is breaking my heart.

1021
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,614
We can get rid of some of this baggage
if you gentlemen will come with me,

1022
01:18:29,749 --> 01:18:33,201
and the rest of you
form a line clear back to the door.

1023
01:19:34,065 --> 01:19:36,390
My new Mainbocher frock is in here.

1024
01:19:36,526 --> 01:19:39,017
The insurance company
isn't gonna like this.

1025
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,918
What a wonderful excuse
to get a new wardrobe.

1026
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:14,163
Be kind of nice
if he came through all this

1027
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:16,542
and didn't know a thing about it.

1028
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:19,831
I need a big man.

1029
01:21:21,591 --> 01:21:22,622
Interested?

1030
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:25,962
-Fascinated.
-Grab me around the waist.

1031
01:21:43,614 --> 01:21:46,401
All right, start kicking things out,
but be careful.

1032
01:21:46,992 --> 01:21:50,942
Keep behind me,
it's lonesome out there.

1033
01:22:59,483 --> 01:23:00,977
That does it.

1034
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,816
Now all we have to do is wait.

1035
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:13,651
Excuse me.

1036
01:23:25,718 --> 01:23:29,252
My kids, they like to hear me play this.

1037
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:13,550
-Aren't you coming back to our seat?
-I'm staying here.

1038
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:15,972
I can't stand that crying towel.

1039
01:25:21,252 --> 01:25:24,668
Hobie, give me 2,250 rpm.

1040
01:25:28,343 --> 01:25:31,178
Crack the cowl flaps.
Watch those head temperatures.

1041
01:25:36,643 --> 01:25:38,517
Give me another inch of boost!

1042
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:41,807
Look at the fuel, Skipper,
the flow meters, we're pouring it in.

1043
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:46,269
I can't help it. This turbulence is slowing
us down and we can't climb out of it!

1044
01:25:58,665 --> 01:26:00,243
Have a cup of coffee.

1045
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:04,245
-I'm plenty hot enough now.
-Then it will cool you off.

1046
01:26:13,681 --> 01:26:16,350
Of course you're worried, Mrs. Joseph.

1047
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:19,393
But I'm quite certain
we'll get out of this all right.

1048
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,220
By tomorrow we can look back on it
as an interesting experience.

1049
01:26:24,233 --> 01:26:27,150
By the by, how old are your children?

1050
01:26:27,737 --> 01:26:31,152
Jennifer is six and Edward is four.

1051
01:26:31,282 --> 01:26:35,659
Jennifer is such a delightful name,
Mrs. Joseph. How fortunate you are.

1052
01:26:36,913 --> 01:26:41,242
Jennifer has always brought to me
the suggestion of the Scottish moor,

1053
01:26:42,251 --> 01:26:45,039
heather, great peace,

1054
01:26:45,546 --> 01:26:48,666
and visions of little villages
nestled against the hills.

1055
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,044
That sort of thing.

1056
01:26:51,511 --> 01:26:53,669
Is your Jennifer anything like that?

1057
01:26:54,264 --> 01:26:58,392
I don't know exactly what you mean,
but she's always been a quiet child.

1058
01:26:58,518 --> 01:26:59,681
Precisely.

1059
01:26:59,936 --> 01:27:03,020
Somehow I knew your Jennifer
would be like that.

1060
01:27:03,189 --> 01:27:07,104
And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing
so fast you can't buy shoes for him.

1061
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:09,694
Every three weeks.

1062
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,447
Why don't you try to rest now?

1063
01:27:14,826 --> 01:27:18,160
Later I'd like to hear
a great deal more about your children.

1064
01:27:28,257 --> 01:27:30,629
I thought you hated
the mere mention of children.

1065
01:27:30,759 --> 01:27:32,040
I do.

1066
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:35,712
But that poor woman is terrified.
I think I helped her.

1067
01:27:37,099 --> 01:27:40,550
For 10 years you've said that
love was a word in the dictionary

1068
01:27:40,686 --> 01:27:42,762
and children were monsters.

1069
01:27:42,896 --> 01:27:46,312
And you would never go two inches
out of your way to help anybody.

1070
01:27:46,442 --> 01:27:48,600
What goes, Gustave?

1071
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:54,197
I've never seen you this way.

1072
01:27:54,325 --> 01:27:56,863
You've forgotten yourself
for a whole hour.

1073
01:27:56,994 --> 01:27:59,948
You've been magnificent.

1074
01:28:00,498 --> 01:28:03,333
Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence.

1075
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:07,497
You told that woman
we'd get out of this all right.

1076
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:09,587
-Do you really believe that?
-No.

1077
01:28:09,966 --> 01:28:14,260
In spite of what that pilot said, I think
we're batting at a very sticky wicket.

1078
01:28:14,679 --> 01:28:17,596
-And yet you're not afraid?
-Yes and no.

1079
01:28:18,308 --> 01:28:20,099
I'm not sure just how I feel.

1080
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:24,428
If I were openly afraid now,
some of the others might become so.

1081
01:28:25,148 --> 01:28:28,932
I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics
right after the fire

1082
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:31,275
and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.

1083
01:28:32,572 --> 01:28:34,612
I just want to know one thing.

1084
01:28:34,866 --> 01:28:37,536
What happened to the biggest baby
in the world?

1085
01:28:37,953 --> 01:28:40,989
The child-man who was afraid to sleep
with the lights off.

1086
01:28:41,122 --> 01:28:44,456
You used to burst into tears
if the laundry put starch in your shirts,

1087
01:28:44,584 --> 01:28:46,743
or the crepe suzette was underdone.

1088
01:28:47,504 --> 01:28:51,917
I don't understand you, Gustave.
I guess I never will.

1089
01:28:53,343 --> 01:28:55,917
Maybe it isn't important
to understand you

1090
01:28:57,514 --> 01:29:01,179
like the other women
you've always managed to keep around.

1091
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,898
I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain
with a throwback, a Roman emperor.

1092
01:29:09,693 --> 01:29:13,561
You bought me on the market, Gustave,
paid for me,

1093
01:29:13,697 --> 01:29:17,316
like you might pay for a play
which you thought might turn out well.

1094
01:29:19,703 --> 01:29:24,496
For 10 years I've lived with that thought
and hated it.

1095
01:29:26,711 --> 01:29:28,834
Now it'll never bother me again.

1096
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,920
Gustave, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

1097
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:43,849
And if we don't get out of this,
I'd like you to know it even more.

1098
01:29:45,396 --> 01:29:47,722
I've never said it before

1099
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,235
and probably you'll never want me
to say it again.

1100
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:54,148
What else is on your twisted little mind?

1101
01:29:58,702 --> 01:30:00,528
I'm in love with you, Gustave.

1102
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:06,115
I guess I always have been.

1103
01:30:15,886 --> 01:30:18,211
And then you tie the ribbons like this.

1104
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:21,470
These preservers are not inflated now.

1105
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:24,388
If you jerk this cord on either side,

1106
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,892
carbon dioxide will be released
from the capsules

1107
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:28,931
and the vest will inflate immediately.

1108
01:30:29,066 --> 01:30:30,311
That's all there is to it.

1109
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:35,197
-Any calls for me?
-Take your pick.

1110
01:30:36,407 --> 01:30:38,150
Boyd, public relations.

1111
01:30:38,617 --> 01:30:41,452
No, Tommy.
We've not lost an airplane.

1112
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:45,239
I'm standing right here in Operations
and our plane is still in the air.

1113
01:30:45,374 --> 01:30:49,039
Yeah, we had a little trouble. No,
I don't know the passengers' names.

1114
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:51,079
Yeah, okay.

1115
01:30:51,213 --> 01:30:54,464
Where's Garfield? This jerk newspaper
wants a statement from the manager.

1116
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,000
He's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

1117
01:30:57,136 --> 01:30:59,010
Boyd, public relations.

1118
01:30:59,388 --> 01:31:02,923
Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown
over 30 million passenger miles

1119
01:31:03,059 --> 01:31:05,098
without ever scratching a passenger.

1120
01:31:05,228 --> 01:31:06,971
Sure we want to cooperate.

1121
01:31:07,105 --> 01:31:10,224
You'll get the straight dope,
just give me time to get organized.

1122
01:31:10,358 --> 01:31:12,018
Goodbye.

1123
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:13,943
Mr. Garfield, can you give me a minute?

1124
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:15,861
Just about. What's your trouble?

1125
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:18,694
The papers are on my neck already.
What will I tell them?

1126
01:31:18,825 --> 01:31:20,782
How about "drop dead" for an opener?

1127
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,662
-You know I can't do that.
-I know.

1128
01:31:23,788 --> 01:31:26,493
-How long can you stall them?
-I don't know, maybe an hour.

1129
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:28,498
They're crying about morning editions.

1130
01:31:28,627 --> 01:31:31,414
An hour might be enough.
We've got real trouble.

1131
01:31:32,172 --> 01:31:34,081
Does it look that bad?

1132
01:31:35,008 --> 01:31:36,800
It don't look good.

1133
01:31:44,434 --> 01:31:46,142
Is everything all right with you two?

1134
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:49,852
I don't know when I've felt better
in the last five years.

1135
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:54,984
I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl I
would most like to be on a life raft with.

1136
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,571
Of course, now,
she may prefer a younger man.

1137
01:31:59,533 --> 01:32:03,282
There is in my family a very old saying.

1138
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:14,042
I will try to translate it for you.

1139
01:32:15,716 --> 01:32:19,548
"The youth of man will never die

1140
01:32:20,221 --> 01:32:22,344
"unless he murders it."

1141
01:32:23,474 --> 01:32:25,301
I plead not guilty.

1142
01:32:26,477 --> 01:32:29,264
I just want to show you
how to use your life vest.

1143
01:32:30,773 --> 01:32:32,683
My neck won't stand any weight,

1144
01:32:32,817 --> 01:32:35,984
and my bones are only held together
by my imagination.

1145
01:32:36,112 --> 01:32:38,899
A burial at sea will save my heirs
a lot of money.

1146
01:32:39,449 --> 01:32:43,032
-I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.
-Why do that?

1147
01:32:43,203 --> 01:32:46,120
You just look more comfortable
that way, Mr. Briscoe.

1148
01:32:46,664 --> 01:32:50,164
You impress me
as the open-collar type anyway.

1149
01:32:50,669 --> 01:32:51,914
Rugged, you know.

1150
01:32:52,045 --> 01:32:53,753
-Outdoorsy, you mean?
-Yes.

1151
01:32:54,422 --> 01:32:55,833
You behave yourself.

1152
01:32:55,966 --> 01:32:58,967
I'll be coming back to make sure
you're being nice to Miss Chen.

1153
01:32:59,094 --> 01:33:02,712
It's a rough assignment
for an outdoor man without his horse,

1154
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,924
but I'll do my best.

1155
01:33:06,018 --> 01:33:08,343
Would you like
to put your vests on now?

1156
01:33:09,396 --> 01:33:13,643
Investigation will undoubtedly prove this
airplane was ready for the junk heap.

1157
01:33:14,109 --> 01:33:16,066
And we're in the hands of incompetents.

1158
01:33:16,195 --> 01:33:20,275
I don't want to make no trouble,
but why don't you shut up?

1159
01:33:20,407 --> 01:33:21,783
You hate me, don't you?

1160
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:24,530
All of you hate me
because I tried to do what was right.

1161
01:33:24,662 --> 01:33:26,868
Do like the little lady says.

1162
01:33:26,997 --> 01:33:29,073
Don't touch me, please.

1163
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:32,659
You're giving me a very bad time,
Mr. Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.

1164
01:33:32,795 --> 01:33:33,957
I have a perfect right...

1165
01:33:34,088 --> 01:33:37,208
You got no rights at all
for some time to come.

1166
01:33:37,633 --> 01:33:42,260
Do like she says or no life vest
is gonna keep you from drowning

1167
01:33:42,388 --> 01:33:46,255
because I'm gonna hold your head
under till you stop wiggling.

1168
01:33:49,687 --> 01:33:53,103
If we should happen to go down,
I'll give you plenty of warning.

1169
01:33:53,232 --> 01:33:56,399
Cross your arms like this
right in front of your face.

1170
01:33:56,611 --> 01:33:59,280
Brace your hands
on the seat just ahead.

1171
01:33:59,656 --> 01:34:02,063
Bend your head down
between your arms,

1172
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,070
and keep them there
until we've stopped completely.

1173
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,328
Remember to remove your shoes.

1174
01:34:07,455 --> 01:34:09,578
You men should loosen
your collar and tie.

1175
01:34:09,707 --> 01:34:11,118
Why?

1176
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:13,208
According to the ditching instructions,

1177
01:34:13,336 --> 01:34:16,006
there is less possibility
of breaking your neck.

1178
01:34:27,601 --> 01:34:29,143
Anything from 420?

1179
01:34:29,728 --> 01:34:31,602
Not a sound out of them, sir.

1180
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,763
Those people,
if they have to ditch tonight

1181
01:34:35,901 --> 01:34:38,439
with the way that wind's
kicking up that sea,

1182
01:34:38,987 --> 01:34:41,276
they don't stand much of a chance,
I'm thinking.

1183
01:35:54,773 --> 01:35:56,730
Cristobal Trader from San Francisco.

1184
01:35:56,858 --> 01:36:00,227
We can work the aircraft clearly now.
Thanks for your help. Over.

1185
01:36:00,362 --> 01:36:02,153
Good. Muchas gracias.

1186
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:06,398
Cristobal Trader over and out.

1187
01:36:37,233 --> 01:36:40,400
How about letting me take over
for a while? Save yourself for later.

1188
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:42,271
-We'll need you.
-All right.

1189
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:53,414
Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.

1190
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:57,456
Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left. But if the
winds are right we can make it.

1191
01:36:57,837 --> 01:37:00,922
We picked up four minutes
in the past hour. I figured it all out.

1192
01:37:01,049 --> 01:37:03,966
If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes,
we're safe.

1193
01:37:04,094 --> 01:37:06,632
Hey, Skipper,
the interceptor is calling us.

1194
01:37:09,182 --> 01:37:12,931
We estimate our position
at 145 miles east of you.

1195
01:37:13,186 --> 01:37:16,353
Expect interception
in approximately 20 minutes.

1196
01:37:16,523 --> 01:37:17,982
Get a bearing on him.

1197
01:37:21,778 --> 01:37:24,530
We will transmit every three minutes
from now on.

1198
01:37:24,656 --> 01:37:28,321
When your needle begins to
fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.

1199
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,819
We will then be very close to you.

1200
01:37:31,705 --> 01:37:33,698
You should have a bearing by now.
How about it?

1201
01:37:40,631 --> 01:37:42,090
We're gonna make it.

1202
01:37:44,468 --> 01:37:48,169
Five degrees north of our course.
We're awful glad to know you're around.

1203
01:37:49,557 --> 01:37:52,807
We know what you mean.
Say, can you guys climb any higher?

1204
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:55,468
Out of this stuff
interception would be a lot easier.

1205
01:37:55,604 --> 01:37:58,890
Negative. We can climb, but we don't
want to use the fuel to do it.

1206
01:37:59,025 --> 01:38:01,017
Every gallon's a mile nearer shore
for us.

1207
01:38:02,236 --> 01:38:04,028
Okay. We'll find you anyway.

1208
01:38:27,762 --> 01:38:30,847
-Are you still afraid?
-No, my darling.

1209
01:38:33,101 --> 01:38:37,229
I don't mean the airplane.
I mean us, our future.

1210
01:38:38,273 --> 01:38:40,230
I'm not afraid of anything now.

1211
01:38:41,485 --> 01:38:42,895
I can't hear you.

1212
01:38:44,571 --> 01:38:47,940
How could I ever be afraid
when you hold me like this?

1213
01:38:48,992 --> 01:38:52,029
-I love you.
-Darling.

1214
01:39:05,968 --> 01:39:06,999
No.

1215
01:39:10,097 --> 01:39:12,090
Just think where we are.

1216
01:39:12,224 --> 01:39:14,632
I'm thinking how awful it would be

1217
01:39:14,768 --> 01:39:17,604
if this was the last time
I could hold you so.

1218
01:39:18,647 --> 01:39:23,060
-We'll have years, all our lives.
-If this airplane makes it.

1219
01:39:24,654 --> 01:39:27,323
Careful, darling.

1220
01:39:35,957 --> 01:39:37,071
Howard.

1221
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:50,174
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

1222
01:39:52,015 --> 01:39:54,304
Would you be sorry if I drowned?

1223
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:57,883
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I have to know.

1224
01:40:00,815 --> 01:40:02,689
I'd be more than sorry.

1225
01:40:04,027 --> 01:40:06,565
You could go off to your North woods.

1226
01:40:09,366 --> 01:40:12,402
It's occurred to me
that trying to make a go at that mine

1227
01:40:12,536 --> 01:40:14,908
might turn out to be a bad dream.

1228
01:40:15,497 --> 01:40:18,249
But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.

1229
01:40:19,751 --> 01:40:20,866
It was.

1230
01:40:23,255 --> 01:40:26,920
I could switch things back.
I suppose that would please you.

1231
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:28,877
I'd only lose you.

1232
01:40:31,055 --> 01:40:34,258
A few hours ago,
you insisted on getting rid of me.

1233
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:42,763
At times I'm a very stupid
and selfish woman.

1234
01:40:45,611 --> 01:40:48,185
I think you should go up to your mine.

1235
01:40:48,781 --> 01:40:50,109
That's you.

1236
01:40:51,826 --> 01:40:54,495
And you might take me along for laughs.

1237
01:40:55,413 --> 01:40:57,121
I'm hearing things.

1238
01:40:58,332 --> 01:41:00,040
You'd be miserable.

1239
01:41:00,501 --> 01:41:01,746
No doubt.

1240
01:41:03,087 --> 01:41:04,581
But I want you.

1241
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,831
The guy I had sense enough to marry.

1242
01:41:10,053 --> 01:41:14,631
If I choke on hotcakes, or try to put
evening gowns on the natives,

1243
01:41:16,518 --> 01:41:20,646
or have cocktails with the sled dogs,
you'll just have to be patient with me.

1244
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:25,103
You don't have to, but I wish you would.

1245
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:31,486
Mush! That's what you say
to a sled dog, isn't it?

1246
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,240
I want to start practicing.

1247
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:41,159
Makes them turn left,
if you yell it loud enough.

1248
01:41:43,962 --> 01:41:46,038
You're very good.

1249
01:41:50,511 --> 01:41:53,677
-Can you get that through to Sullivan?
-I can try.

1250
01:41:53,889 --> 01:41:56,510
-Everything else buttoned up?
-Yes, sir.

1251
01:41:59,395 --> 01:42:02,811
-Any improvement in the local weather?
-I'm afraid not.

1252
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:23,335
-Radar, anything yet?
-No target, sir.

1253
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:27,206
Navigator, how's our position
for interception?

1254
01:42:27,423 --> 01:42:29,630
Dead on. Just got a loran fix.

1255
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:33,761
We should be joining now,
if their navigator is anywhere near right.

1256
01:42:45,442 --> 01:42:47,565
-Radar?
-No target, sir.

1257
01:42:47,902 --> 01:42:50,820
-Somebody's wrong.
-We should be right on top of them.

1258
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:55,607
We can easily miss this guy.

1259
01:42:57,829 --> 01:42:59,323
No target, sir.

1260
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:05,749
That navigator's wacky.
We're already seven minutes overdue.

1261
01:43:07,255 --> 01:43:08,370
Radar?

1262
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:13,131
Target, Skipper. Strong blip.
Four degrees left, eight miles.

1263
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:15,048
Looks like he's 500 feet below us.

1264
01:43:32,031 --> 01:43:33,691
Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?

1265
01:43:34,658 --> 01:43:37,992
What happened to the 11 minutes
you were counting on?

1266
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:40,404
What happened to them, fatso?

1267
01:43:40,831 --> 01:43:43,369
You never could make them up,
you just thought you could.

1268
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:48,578
-Lennie, what about it?
-Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.

1269
01:43:59,892 --> 01:44:02,384
Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.

1270
01:44:03,313 --> 01:44:06,646
Find the minutes,
and you can come back to me.

1271
01:44:07,442 --> 01:44:09,233
Minutes.

1272
01:44:09,944 --> 01:44:11,818
Who's got the minutes?

1273
01:44:11,946 --> 01:44:14,484
Your Susie's got them, right here.

1274
01:44:17,244 --> 01:44:19,283
Come on, Lennie.
What's holding things up?

1275
01:44:19,412 --> 01:44:21,950
The Coast Guard says
your position's wrong.

1276
01:44:22,082 --> 01:44:24,324
I'll be right with you, Skipper.

1277
01:44:33,218 --> 01:44:34,463
Skipper?

1278
01:44:37,806 --> 01:44:39,300
I got bad news.

1279
01:44:40,809 --> 01:44:44,178
The Coast Guard was right.
I made a dumb kid's mistake.

1280
01:44:45,064 --> 01:44:48,480
We're not as close to the coast
as I thought we were.

1281
01:44:48,609 --> 01:44:51,361
I was figuring in knots instead of miles.

1282
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:54,235
I guess I was just scared.

1283
01:44:54,448 --> 01:44:56,192
What about those 11 minutes?

1284
01:44:56,325 --> 01:44:59,361
They can make the difference
between the water and your own bed.

1285
01:44:59,495 --> 01:45:01,073
They aren't there.

1286
01:45:02,081 --> 01:45:03,908
They never were there.

1287
01:45:05,084 --> 01:45:06,744
I'm sorry, Skipper.

1288
01:45:19,974 --> 01:45:21,848
I hope this will float.

1289
01:45:46,084 --> 01:45:48,871
I am so excited about your arrival,
Sally.

1290
01:45:49,212 --> 01:45:53,080
Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains
and pines, which will be your home, too,

1291
01:45:53,216 --> 01:45:56,882
and go down to the city
for my first visit in over a year.

1292
01:45:57,304 --> 01:45:59,795
I want to get there
a few days before you arrive,

1293
01:45:59,932 --> 01:46:02,304
because there are some things
this cabin needs

1294
01:46:02,434 --> 01:46:05,103
to make it more comfortable for a girl.

1295
01:46:07,606 --> 01:46:10,607
I'm still scared you won't like it up here,

1296
01:46:19,869 --> 01:46:23,238
unless you're nuts about
the sound of a mountain stream,

1297
01:46:23,372 --> 01:46:27,619
or love to watch the sun seem to turn
a mountain peak around very slow.

1298
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:33,788
Hey, Henry.

1299
01:46:39,096 --> 01:46:41,504
One of our neighbors
just came by to say hello.

1300
01:46:41,641 --> 01:46:43,680
A little fawn I call Henry.

1301
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:47,220
He seems to ask,
"Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"

1302
01:46:47,355 --> 01:46:48,814
So hurry, girl!

1303
01:46:51,484 --> 01:46:53,892
So you'll be sure to recognize me
at the airport,

1304
01:46:54,028 --> 01:46:56,436
I'll be wearing a bright green tie.

1305
01:46:57,532 --> 01:46:59,988
P.S. I was just thinking how lucky I am.

1306
01:47:00,118 --> 01:47:02,526
I happened to pick up
an old torn magazine

1307
01:47:02,662 --> 01:47:06,162
and there is your picture,
smacking me right between the eyes.

1308
01:47:06,291 --> 01:47:10,039
And only a short time later,
that very wonderful-looking little girl

1309
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:12,209
is coming to share my life.

1310
01:47:36,655 --> 01:47:37,984
Remarkable.

1311
01:47:39,616 --> 01:47:41,360
What's so remarkable?

1312
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,870
Is it faith or just habit
that compels a woman

1313
01:47:44,997 --> 01:47:48,200
to put on fresh makeup
before boarding a life raft?

1314
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:50,707
Aren't you jumping the gun?

1315
01:47:51,253 --> 01:47:54,420
You're being a fatalist
about this business then?

1316
01:47:56,926 --> 01:47:59,470
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1317
01:47:59,470 --> 01:47:59,837
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1318
01:48:00,388 --> 01:48:02,795
How can you sit there so calmly then,

1319
01:48:02,932 --> 01:48:05,174
when a little while ago
you were terrified?

1320
01:48:05,893 --> 01:48:10,223
I sat down here with you because
I thought I might be able to help you.

1321
01:48:10,606 --> 01:48:12,266
But I'm not needed.

1322
01:48:14,277 --> 01:48:16,234
If you came over to give me help,

1323
01:48:16,362 --> 01:48:19,447
it was partly because
you needed help yourself,

1324
01:48:21,117 --> 01:48:22,398
very badly.

1325
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,038
Don't worry about me.

1326
01:48:27,165 --> 01:48:29,621
I've just stopped worrying
about losing something

1327
01:48:29,751 --> 01:48:32,456
I never had a chance to get
in the first place.

1328
01:48:32,587 --> 01:48:36,087
Would the thing be a man?
Or am I getting too personal?

1329
01:48:36,925 --> 01:48:38,088
You are.

1330
01:48:38,426 --> 01:48:40,170
I don't care anymore.

1331
01:48:41,304 --> 01:48:43,842
I've been kidding myself long enough.

1332
01:48:45,642 --> 01:48:47,884
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

1333
01:48:49,229 --> 01:48:51,186
What are you hiding from?

1334
01:48:53,817 --> 01:48:54,980
Myself.

1335
01:48:57,613 --> 01:49:00,816
He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.

1336
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:05,279
He has a right to know
what kind of a person I am.

1337
01:49:06,622 --> 01:49:08,531
I'm going to tell him

1338
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:12,117
that I'm a different kind of person
than he thinks I am.

1339
01:49:15,673 --> 01:49:17,416
I'm not wonderful,

1340
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:22,001
not kind, I'm not clean.

1341
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:29,684
Telling you these things is easy,
because you're a stranger

1342
01:49:29,812 --> 01:49:31,971
and I'll never see you again.

1343
01:49:34,192 --> 01:49:35,816
Telling him is...

1344
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:40,813
It's going to be one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life,

1345
01:49:42,575 --> 01:49:44,319
'cause in my heart,

1346
01:49:46,496 --> 01:49:48,323
I'll always see him

1347
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:52,745
even when he turns his back
and walks away.

1348
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:02,463
Look at my face.

1349
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,138
Wouldn't you walk away?

1350
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:11,479
I'm so much older
than my years have made me.

1351
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:15,859
Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.

1352
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:18,560
You'll see how very old I am.

1353
01:50:21,657 --> 01:50:22,855
I'm beat.

1354
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:27,199
I'll make a swell-looking bride.

1355
01:50:28,706 --> 01:50:30,116
A beat bride.

1356
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:35,709
But I'm not afraid anymore.

1357
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:42,257
Now that I know what's going to happen,
I'm almost happy.

1358
01:50:46,599 --> 01:50:49,635
So, I wasn't making up my face
a few minutes ago.

1359
01:50:52,021 --> 01:50:54,477
I was looking in the mirror, at me.

1360
01:50:57,568 --> 01:51:00,238
Does that answer your question,
mister?

1361
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:04,408
I was mistaken.

1362
01:51:05,702 --> 01:51:09,367
You aren't a fatalist.
You're a very courageous young lady.

1363
01:51:11,708 --> 01:51:15,456
Maybe some of it will brush off on me
if I keep sitting here.

1364
01:51:16,504 --> 01:51:19,671
Maybe I can throw a few things
out of my own life.

1365
01:51:41,405 --> 01:51:44,441
-Cigarette?
-No, thanks. I don't use them things.

1366
01:51:51,832 --> 01:51:54,038
-Do you have to do that?
-Yeah.

1367
01:52:00,174 --> 01:52:02,581
Could I have my property back now?

1368
01:52:02,718 --> 01:52:05,968
-Why?
-It would mean a great deal to me.

1369
01:52:07,014 --> 01:52:10,217
Take away this feeling
of being constantly watched.

1370
01:52:11,644 --> 01:52:14,764
I'm all right, now. Quite calm.
You can trust me.

1371
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,357
Sit down.

1372
01:52:28,953 --> 01:52:33,864
You got lots to think about,
and maybe not so much time for to do it.

1373
01:52:55,272 --> 01:52:58,854
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

1374
01:52:58,984 --> 01:53:02,519
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1375
01:53:03,697 --> 01:53:05,571
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1376
01:53:05,699 --> 01:53:08,107
hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come...

1377
01:53:13,582 --> 01:53:15,160
Sparks, get on the horn.

1378
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:17,617
Advised interception completed at 56.

1379
01:53:24,593 --> 01:53:26,550
Okay, Dan. I'll take over.

1380
01:53:41,944 --> 01:53:45,313
Go back now. Take the Gibson girl,
get the passengers all set.

1381
01:53:45,448 --> 01:53:47,440
You'll have plenty of time.

1382
01:53:47,575 --> 01:53:52,036
Turn on the seat belt sign 10 minutes
before we start for the water.

1383
01:54:03,466 --> 01:54:05,258
Good luck, you guys.

1384
01:54:08,346 --> 01:54:11,181
-Anything new with the wind, Lennie?
-No.

1385
01:54:11,516 --> 01:54:13,473
We're not very fat, then?

1386
01:54:13,601 --> 01:54:18,477
-If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.
-Eleven minutes? Is that all you need?

1387
01:54:19,024 --> 01:54:22,108
-Are you sure?
-I know exactly where we are now.

1388
01:54:22,486 --> 01:54:24,774
Eleven minutes more of fuel
would see us through.

1389
01:54:24,905 --> 01:54:29,318
What increase in wind velocity would
we need to arrange that little thing?

1390
01:54:29,451 --> 01:54:31,444
Twenty knots in the next hour.

1391
01:54:31,578 --> 01:54:33,785
-That's asking a lot.
-Yeah.

1392
01:54:34,623 --> 01:54:36,781
It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.

1393
01:54:36,917 --> 01:54:39,586
But if the wind swung around
a little more in the tail

1394
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:41,040
it could be.

1395
01:54:45,426 --> 01:54:48,296
I guess they'll pick us up
before we get too damp.

1396
01:54:48,429 --> 01:54:50,338
Susie will sure be worried.

1397
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:54,055
She'll lay down the law.
Probably insist I quit flying.

1398
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:57,265
Will you?

1399
01:55:00,691 --> 01:55:01,722
No.

1400
01:55:09,534 --> 01:55:12,784
-Everything's here. I just hope it works.
-It will.

1401
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:17,530
Wouldn't you rather
not have to depend on it?

1402
01:55:17,667 --> 01:55:20,502
-What do you mean?
-Suppose we didn't ditch.

1403
01:55:20,628 --> 01:55:21,957
You've got to.

1404
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:26,545
Lennie says all we need
is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.

1405
01:55:27,552 --> 01:55:30,304
Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.

1406
01:55:32,182 --> 01:55:35,930
Would you think I was wrong
if I tried to talk him out of it?

1407
01:55:36,519 --> 01:55:38,477
Maybe try a little luck?

1408
01:55:39,773 --> 01:55:40,852
Luck?

1409
01:55:41,066 --> 01:55:43,142
That's has-been thinking.

1410
01:55:43,318 --> 01:55:45,891
Wanna run out of fuel,
right over San Francisco?

1411
01:55:46,029 --> 01:55:48,816
Wipe out a few bridges
or apartment houses?

1412
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:53,112
Sullivan's been over this ocean
lots of times. He knows his business.

1413
01:55:53,745 --> 01:55:56,201
I've seen men act like this before.

1414
01:55:57,207 --> 01:56:00,208
Sometimes because of one thing
or another,

1415
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:03,993
fella stops thinking straight temporarily.

1416
01:56:10,721 --> 01:56:12,963
I've been flying a long time, Hobie.

1417
01:56:16,435 --> 01:56:18,226
Only, you're not the captain.

1418
01:56:18,354 --> 01:56:20,014
Maybe because your so-called luck

1419
01:56:20,147 --> 01:56:22,982
ran out on you once
down in South America.

1420
01:56:23,275 --> 01:56:25,268
This is no luck operation.

1421
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:31,284
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1422
01:56:31,284 --> 01:56:31,532
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1423
01:56:35,872 --> 01:56:36,986
Maybe.

1424
01:57:36,975 --> 01:57:40,594
Here it is, Lennie.
Color may not become you

1425
01:57:41,522 --> 01:57:44,938
-but it'll suffice you.
-Thanks, for nothing.

1426
01:57:48,612 --> 01:57:52,361
About that 11 minutes,
are you absolutely sure?

1427
01:57:52,908 --> 01:57:54,237
Absolutely.

1428
01:58:02,627 --> 01:58:06,209
Lennie says if we can pick up
11 minutes, we can make it.

1429
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,345
He could be right.

1430
01:58:19,143 --> 01:58:22,643
It'll be rough down there.
If we hit wrong, we've had it.

1431
01:58:25,442 --> 01:58:30,151
Maybe we ought to ease off a little on
the power and save a few drops of fuel.

1432
01:58:32,449 --> 01:58:34,488
Any objections if I try it?

1433
01:58:39,915 --> 01:58:42,157
This won't work.
She's going to stall on me.

1434
01:58:42,292 --> 01:58:44,415
That's no good.
We'll blow another engine.

1435
01:58:44,544 --> 01:58:47,664
What's the difference?
We'll blow them all if we ditch.

1436
01:58:48,131 --> 01:58:50,919
Put those controls back
where they belong.

1437
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:54,179
-Put those props back.
-Nothing doing, Skipper.

1438
01:58:54,304 --> 01:58:55,847
That's an order!

1439
01:58:57,182 --> 01:59:00,551
Hang on, chum. You can do it.
Now fly and let me pray.

1440
01:59:00,686 --> 01:59:02,809
We'll run out of gas,
right over San Francisco.

1441
01:59:02,938 --> 01:59:07,185
Let's try out this way for a while.
Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!

1442
01:59:07,818 --> 01:59:10,107
-She's starting to shake again.
-Let her shake!

1443
01:59:10,237 --> 01:59:13,606
Let her mush down a few feet if you
have to. We're saving fuel this way.

1444
01:59:13,741 --> 01:59:15,200
Hang on and fly!

1445
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:24,500
Did you call Sullivan's wife?

1446
01:59:24,627 --> 01:59:26,869
Yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport.

1447
01:59:27,004 --> 01:59:28,547
-You didn't alarm her?
-No.

1448
01:59:28,673 --> 01:59:32,256
I just told her, her husband was on
his way, and that you wanted to see her.

1449
01:59:32,385 --> 01:59:34,212
Then she knows something's happened.

1450
01:59:34,345 --> 01:59:37,050
Probably. But her voice was quite calm.

1451
01:59:37,765 --> 01:59:39,473
How about the others?

1452
01:59:39,601 --> 01:59:43,385
Wheeler lives with another pilot,
Dupree. There was no answer.

1453
01:59:43,938 --> 01:59:45,598
The same for Wilby.

1454
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:49,772
I called his home
and then a bar I know about.

1455
01:59:50,445 --> 01:59:53,814
His wife had been there,
but she left about an hour ago,

1456
01:59:53,948 --> 01:59:55,063
drunk.

1457
01:59:57,452 --> 02:00:00,702
-The stewardess?
-No, Spalding's mother isn't well.

1458
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:03,452
Her father is out of town on business.

1459
02:00:04,543 --> 02:00:06,452
I wish I could tell them all together.

1460
02:00:06,586 --> 02:00:09,291
I think maybe they could
help each other.

1461
02:00:09,423 --> 02:00:12,258
There isn't anybody listed on there
for Dan Roman.

1462
02:00:12,384 --> 02:00:15,587
-Do you know any person close to him?
-Yeah.

1463
02:00:16,471 --> 02:00:19,887
But I don't think you could reach her.
Dan lives alone.

1464
02:00:49,130 --> 02:00:52,084
-Is everything all right?
-Just great, junior.

1465
02:00:54,886 --> 02:00:56,962
This is a stunning garment.

1466
02:00:57,513 --> 02:01:00,087
I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.

1467
02:01:01,517 --> 02:01:04,353
It's a frowsy looking shroud,
if you ask me.

1468
02:01:09,192 --> 02:01:10,307
Baby.

1469
02:01:13,822 --> 02:01:17,819
I went through the first World War
and the Blitz in London.

1470
02:01:20,203 --> 02:01:22,492
I was scared, but not like this.

1471
02:01:27,377 --> 02:01:31,161
I want to show you something cute.
Want to see something cute?

1472
02:01:32,758 --> 02:01:34,584
I must be slipping.

1473
02:01:34,718 --> 02:01:39,047
No reaction, even from a man like you,
who should appreciate such things.

1474
02:01:42,559 --> 02:01:46,308
Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.

1475
02:01:48,398 --> 02:01:49,857
I'm frightened.

1476
02:01:49,983 --> 02:01:53,150
Talking. Honey, you don't know
what you're asking.

1477
02:01:53,737 --> 02:01:55,979
I'll tell you a good joke on me.

1478
02:01:56,115 --> 02:01:59,400
You know, I always dreaded
the idea of becoming an old woman,

1479
02:01:59,535 --> 02:02:03,912
and from the way things look now,
I won't have to worry about it anymore.

1480
02:02:05,916 --> 02:02:08,123
You know, I haven't been whistled at
in years.

1481
02:02:08,252 --> 02:02:10,043
And the idea of growing roses

1482
02:02:10,171 --> 02:02:13,291
for the rest of my life
was really beginning to haunt me.

1483
02:02:15,593 --> 02:02:18,879
There ought to be a home
for dames like me.

1484
02:02:19,013 --> 02:02:20,840
We should have organized.

1485
02:02:21,808 --> 02:02:24,974
You know, a house somewhere
with no mirror in it.

1486
02:02:26,145 --> 02:02:29,561
Far away, where we'd never have
to look at a young girl.

1487
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,973
They have homes
for unmarried mothers.

1488
02:02:33,444 --> 02:02:36,362
But everybody forgets
about the girls who

1489
02:02:37,073 --> 02:02:40,738
never quite managed
to make things legal.

1490
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:44,822
I think I could start one.

1491
02:02:46,166 --> 02:02:50,875
I can call it the "May Holst Home
for Broken-down Broads."

1492
02:02:53,298 --> 02:02:55,540
I kind of like that, don't you?

1493
02:03:07,437 --> 02:03:10,107
Well, they're as ready now
as they'll ever be.

1494
02:03:11,316 --> 02:03:13,642
Can you take something else
in your stride?

1495
02:03:13,777 --> 02:03:14,808
I can try.

1496
02:03:14,945 --> 02:03:16,060
Good.

1497
02:03:16,196 --> 02:03:18,154
I want you to do me a favor.

1498
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:24,159
Look, when I tell you, sit down there
with your back against that seat,

1499
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,446
stay there,
no matter what else is going on.

1500
02:03:26,582 --> 02:03:29,453
Don't try to be a heroine
because in those last few moments,

1501
02:03:29,585 --> 02:03:33,084
there isn't anything in the world
you can do to help anybody.

1502
02:03:33,214 --> 02:03:35,621
You know, your face
can improve any landscape.

1503
02:03:35,758 --> 02:03:37,418
I want you to keep it that way.

1504
02:03:37,551 --> 02:03:39,176
So the favor for me is this pillow.

1505
02:03:39,303 --> 02:03:42,553
Hold it tightly over your face,
for yourself and for me.

1506
02:03:42,682 --> 02:03:45,089
With the wind and the sea
neither God nor Sullivan

1507
02:03:45,226 --> 02:03:47,384
can set this thing down tonight
like an egg crate.

1508
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:51,565
We might just as well slam
into a mountain. Dan knows it. I know it.

1509
02:03:51,691 --> 02:03:52,971
And so does Sullivan.

1510
02:03:59,449 --> 02:04:02,201
Wilby, check your final position.
I'm going to take her down.

1511
02:04:02,327 --> 02:04:03,904
-Wait a few more minutes.
-Do as I say.

1512
02:04:04,037 --> 02:04:05,448
-But it looks like...
-Do as I say.

1513
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:06,860
Give him a few more minutes.

1514
02:04:06,998 --> 02:04:09,323
I've already waited too long.
Here we go.

1515
02:04:09,459 --> 02:04:13,457
No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself,
you yellow...

1516
02:04:21,555 --> 02:04:23,512
420 is losing altitude, sir.

1517
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:25,384
420, from Coast Guard.

1518
02:04:25,726 --> 02:04:28,976
Radar reports you're descending.
Are you going to ditch?

1519
02:04:31,732 --> 02:04:35,183
You are now below the minimum legal
altitude for approaching the coast.

1520
02:04:35,319 --> 02:04:38,236
Time's wasting.
You better climb or settle for the drink.

1521
02:04:38,363 --> 02:04:41,567
We're right with you. We'll follow you
down. Advise immediately.

1522
02:04:42,659 --> 02:04:46,325
420 to Coast Guard.

1523
02:04:47,247 --> 02:04:49,917
We've been too busy to answer.
Stand by.

1524
02:04:50,501 --> 02:04:52,707
We may have a change in plans.

1525
02:05:03,556 --> 02:05:06,308
Thirty minutes of fuel left.
Cross-feed problem.

1526
02:05:07,226 --> 02:05:09,183
Throw the rule book away.

1527
02:05:09,437 --> 02:05:12,521
Highest obstruction, 1, 950 feet,

1528
02:05:12,648 --> 02:05:15,056
so 2,200 will be safe.

1529
02:05:17,695 --> 02:05:21,147
Leonard, stand by electric altimeter,
call out readings.

1530
02:05:21,282 --> 02:05:23,654
Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.

1531
02:05:23,785 --> 02:05:26,490
More efficient use of fuel against time.

1532
02:05:26,955 --> 02:05:28,615
Study approach book.

1533
02:05:29,249 --> 02:05:31,621
Air Traffic Control to clear area.

1534
02:05:31,793 --> 02:05:34,249
Direction finders on range station.

1535
02:05:35,338 --> 02:05:36,916
Start right now.

1536
02:05:39,801 --> 02:05:40,832
Dan?

1537
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:42,751
Yeah?

1538
02:05:43,722 --> 02:05:44,884
Thanks.

1539
02:05:45,891 --> 02:05:48,761
Thanks for knocking some sense
into my head.

1540
02:05:49,436 --> 02:05:52,188
-Someday I'll explain.
-You don't have to.

1541
02:05:53,649 --> 02:05:57,598
We're not going to ditch.
We'll make San Francisco the hard way.

1542
02:05:58,904 --> 02:06:00,363
Any change in the wind, Lennie?

1543
02:06:00,489 --> 02:06:02,197
We picked up three of those
11 minutes.

1544
02:06:02,324 --> 02:06:05,278
Bring me the approach chart
for San Francisco.

1545
02:06:09,373 --> 02:06:11,330
Whistle me a tune, Dan.

1546
02:06:12,543 --> 02:06:14,535
I like music while I work.

1547
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:31,765
-Can I get you something, Mr. Briscoe?
-Yes. A ham sandwich.

1548
02:06:31,938 --> 02:06:35,686
I can't. Everything went overboard.
Now you put on that vest.

1549
02:06:35,942 --> 02:06:37,187
Great service.

1550
02:06:37,318 --> 02:06:40,652
You throw all the food to the sharks,
so you won't have to serve it.

1551
02:06:41,155 --> 02:06:43,195
Tell you what. Proposition.

1552
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:46,819
I think Miss Chen will let me
buy her a steak in San Francisco,

1553
02:06:46,953 --> 02:06:49,076
if you come along, too.

1554
02:06:49,205 --> 02:06:51,827
If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.

1555
02:06:52,458 --> 02:06:54,996
Mr. Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.

1556
02:07:03,219 --> 02:07:05,675
-Take a breather, Dan.
-Okay.

1557
02:07:11,394 --> 02:07:13,186
The Farallon Islands, any minute now.

1558
02:07:16,233 --> 02:07:18,521
-Don't go any lower.
-No. I'll hold this altitude.

1559
02:07:18,652 --> 02:07:21,404
Get back and call out our altitude
on the radio altimeter.

1560
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:24,531
We'll make straight for the
northwest leg of San Francisco range.

1561
02:07:24,658 --> 02:07:27,363
The area's been cleared
and we're practically on the ground.

1562
02:07:27,494 --> 02:07:29,653
I like the way you said that.

1563
02:07:40,633 --> 02:07:43,634
Twenty-eight miles to go.
He's made first base.

1564
02:07:43,761 --> 02:07:46,596
But if that guy runs out of fuel
between here and the airport,

1565
02:07:46,722 --> 02:07:48,679
I don't know where he'll put
that thing down

1566
02:07:48,808 --> 02:07:50,385
except in the middle of Market Street.

1567
02:08:03,531 --> 02:08:05,239
Shut that thing off.

1568
02:08:10,913 --> 02:08:11,945
Well?

1569
02:08:14,709 --> 02:08:18,659
I'm going over to the terminal.
If needed, I'll be in the control tower.

1570
02:08:58,837 --> 02:09:00,664
This is it. Ten minutes.

1571
02:09:01,507 --> 02:09:03,464
Come on, let's make a final check.

1572
02:09:09,682 --> 02:09:10,796
Inflate your vest, please.

1573
02:09:10,933 --> 02:09:12,973
-We're going down?
-Yeah, but you'll be all right.

1574
02:09:13,102 --> 02:09:16,056
Take your time coming back to the door.
Wait until I yell.

1575
02:09:16,188 --> 02:09:19,688
-Coast Guard plane still with us?
-Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.

1576
02:09:19,817 --> 02:09:21,442
Put out your cigarette, please.

1577
02:09:21,569 --> 02:09:24,772
Inflate your vest, Mr. Childs.
You too, Miss Holst.

1578
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:29,906
-Some brassiere.
-Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.

1579
02:09:30,578 --> 02:09:32,238
I really ought to take my briefcase.

1580
02:09:32,371 --> 02:09:34,945
Sorry, nothing doing.
Inflate your vest, please.

1581
02:09:40,004 --> 02:09:41,167
I can't.

1582
02:09:41,673 --> 02:09:43,131
I'm terrified.

1583
02:09:44,133 --> 02:09:45,877
I can't seem to move.

1584
02:09:51,307 --> 02:09:53,181
Don't worry. Good luck.

1585
02:09:56,688 --> 02:09:59,013
-All set, you two?
-We're still hungry.

1586
02:09:59,149 --> 02:10:02,185
Our steak date is postponed.
Inflate your vest, please.

1587
02:10:07,491 --> 02:10:09,068
Maybe you should keep this.

1588
02:10:09,201 --> 02:10:12,367
I'd loved thinking it was mine,
even if it was just for a few hours.

1589
02:10:12,496 --> 02:10:14,821
Nonsense.
You can keep it as dry as I can.

1590
02:10:14,957 --> 02:10:17,163
If it's still working tomorrow night
at 7:00,

1591
02:10:17,292 --> 02:10:20,496
take a cab to Ernie's restaurant
on Montgomery street.

1592
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:23,250
If it isn't working, come anyway.

1593
02:10:23,715 --> 02:10:24,878
Thanks.

1594
02:10:25,509 --> 02:10:27,881
We got them all to blow up, see?

1595
02:10:28,095 --> 02:10:31,381
Good work. Remember take your time
coming back to the door.

1596
02:10:31,724 --> 02:10:32,922
You want?

1597
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:35,306
No, thanks. Thanks just the same.

1598
02:10:35,436 --> 02:10:39,184
If anything happens to me,
get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.

1599
02:10:39,315 --> 02:10:42,600
-Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken.
-You tell her yourself, mister.

1600
02:10:42,735 --> 02:10:46,567
You'll be all right. I'm not worrying and
I'll be the last guy off this airplane.

1601
02:10:46,697 --> 02:10:49,367
-Do you have to be?
-That's what I get paid for.

1602
02:10:50,993 --> 02:10:53,152
-Seat belt tight?
-I think so.

1603
02:10:54,497 --> 02:10:56,075
This is for real, isn't it?

1604
02:10:56,207 --> 02:10:58,912
I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.

1605
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:06,213
Well, even I might float.

1606
02:11:09,304 --> 02:11:11,296
Inflate your vest, please.

1607
02:11:24,277 --> 02:11:27,397
I don't want to die.

1608
02:11:27,531 --> 02:11:30,900
Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.

1609
02:11:32,494 --> 02:11:35,993
Give her two of these when you can.
They'll quiet her.

1610
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:09,570
Stand by for anything. Sullivan is gonna
try and make San Francisco.

1611
02:12:09,699 --> 02:12:10,944
-Can we?
-I don't see how.

1612
02:12:11,075 --> 02:12:13,827
Technically, we're out of fuel right now.

1613
02:12:16,831 --> 02:12:18,408
We've bought it.

1614
02:12:32,096 --> 02:12:35,430
550 feet, Skipper.
The coast hills must be coming up.

1615
02:12:35,558 --> 02:12:37,467
-Watch it!
-400, a little less.

1616
02:12:37,602 --> 02:12:38,800
Hang on!

1617
02:12:41,648 --> 02:12:42,810
330.

1618
02:12:43,274 --> 02:12:44,306
250.

1619
02:12:44,734 --> 02:12:45,979
Ground's coming up fast!

1620
02:12:50,198 --> 02:12:51,990
200, Skipper. This ain't good.

1621
02:12:55,036 --> 02:12:56,068
180.

1622
02:13:03,837 --> 02:13:05,664
420, from Coast Guard.

1623
02:13:06,006 --> 02:13:08,497
Twin Peaks coming up on your left
in a minute or so.

1624
02:13:08,634 --> 02:13:11,172
Remember those radio towers.
Stay on course.

1625
02:13:11,553 --> 02:13:13,380
Don't descend anymore.

1626
02:13:13,764 --> 02:13:15,840
Thanks. We're trying not to.

1627
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:18,642
150 feet, Skipper!

1628
02:14:57,328 --> 02:14:59,819
300 feet, Skipper.
We must be past the hills.

1629
02:15:07,046 --> 02:15:08,077
400.

1630
02:15:11,968 --> 02:15:13,592
500. We're living!

1631
02:15:22,937 --> 02:15:27,065
420, this is San Francisco Towers.
Special weather.

1632
02:15:27,484 --> 02:15:31,896
Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.
Wind, west northwest.

1633
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:34,403
Twenty to 25. Over.

1634
02:15:35,241 --> 02:15:39,156
Okay, San Francisco Tower.
We'll make an ILS approach.

1635
02:15:39,663 --> 02:15:42,201
Turn the runway lights up full blast.

1636
02:16:36,971 --> 02:16:39,676
-Cone of silence.
-Right with you, chum.

1637
02:16:39,807 --> 02:16:43,057
-We're cleared straight on down.
-This is going to be a fast one.

1638
02:16:43,186 --> 02:16:45,511
Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.

1639
02:16:49,859 --> 02:16:52,018
Get the outer marker, Dan.

1640
02:16:52,737 --> 02:16:56,023
Outer marker identified.
But we're way below our glide path,

1641
02:16:56,157 --> 02:16:57,355
so watch it, chum.

1642
02:16:57,492 --> 02:17:00,197
There's a 690-foot radio tower
around here someplace.

1643
02:17:00,328 --> 02:17:03,282
Has to be behind us,
we're right on the approach leg.

1644
02:17:03,832 --> 02:17:06,204
Let me know it when they're clear.

1645
02:17:30,234 --> 02:17:32,689
Feather it, Dan! Quick!
No time to fool with it.

1646
02:17:35,864 --> 02:17:38,355
Give me full power on the other two.

1647
02:17:40,953 --> 02:17:43,029
-You see anything?
-Not yet.

1648
02:18:08,231 --> 02:18:09,808
-Contact yet?
-No.

1649
02:18:13,486 --> 02:18:16,902
-This is a sweater.
-You're doing fine.

1650
02:18:18,074 --> 02:18:21,194
When we pass the inner marker,
I'm shoving her down regardless.

1651
02:18:21,327 --> 02:18:22,359
Yeah.

1652
02:18:27,334 --> 02:18:29,789
Approach lights dead ahead.
Maybe a mile.

1653
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,497
Give her the gear.

1654
02:18:32,631 --> 02:18:34,255
Three green lights and pressure.

1655
02:18:39,721 --> 02:18:42,758
We can only stay in the air
another 30 seconds.

1656
02:18:43,308 --> 02:18:46,143
-Full flaps.
-Full flaps.

1657
02:18:58,449 --> 02:19:01,153
Now I lay me down to sleep.

1658
02:20:00,178 --> 02:20:02,716
Did you get hurt?
Was anyone hurt at all?

1659
02:20:15,402 --> 02:20:16,730
Two more coming down now.

1660
02:20:16,862 --> 02:20:18,321
There's Mr. Pardee,
the famous producer.

1661
02:20:18,447 --> 02:20:20,523
He'll give us some information.

1662
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:26,578
-You're Gustave Pardee, aren't you?
-I was. I'm not so sure now.

1663
02:20:26,705 --> 02:20:28,698
Please leave us alone. We're very tired.

1664
02:20:28,832 --> 02:20:30,492
Give us a few words about your flight.

1665
02:20:30,626 --> 02:20:32,535
I couldn't tell you.
Not in a million words.

1666
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:36,252
-What will your next production be?
-It will take a little longer than usual.

1667
02:20:36,382 --> 02:20:38,006
-Next year, I hope.
-Next year?

1668
02:20:38,134 --> 02:20:39,509
Now, please let us pass.

1669
02:20:50,396 --> 02:20:51,511
Sally!

1670
02:20:54,317 --> 02:20:55,645
Who are you?

1671
02:21:12,836 --> 02:21:14,246
Miss, just one statement.

1672
02:21:14,963 --> 02:21:17,632
-Tell us who you are.
-What's your name?

1673
02:21:21,970 --> 02:21:23,797
-Why, it's a boy!
-Little boy.

1674
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:27,133
He'll sure have a story
to tell his grandkids.

1675
02:21:36,985 --> 02:21:40,853
-Daddy wants you to come and see him.
-I will, darling. I will!

1676
02:21:42,491 --> 02:21:45,942
Look at my space material.

1677
02:21:51,709 --> 02:21:54,282
-Here he is. Who's that?
-Give us a statement.

1678
02:21:56,755 --> 02:21:59,673
Where's the nearest telephone?
I have to call Honolulu, my wife.

1679
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:01,045
-Over there.
-Thanks.

1680
02:22:01,177 --> 02:22:02,635
No questions, please.

1681
02:22:02,761 --> 02:22:04,220
What happened?

1682
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:06,636
Here she is.

1683
02:22:07,683 --> 02:22:09,972
Hold it right there. Thank you.

1684
02:22:10,102 --> 02:22:11,846
She must be in show business.

1685
02:22:11,979 --> 02:22:13,972
She's in show business, all right.

1686
02:22:18,027 --> 02:22:19,854
She's the star of the Follies!

1687
02:22:21,739 --> 02:22:23,150
Tell us your story.

1688
02:22:24,409 --> 02:22:25,867
Just one.

1689
02:22:36,671 --> 02:22:39,340
Papa!

1690
02:22:42,886 --> 02:22:44,546
Just a moment.

1691
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:50,388
Listen, boys. I'm just a fisherman.
I want to see my kids.

1692
02:23:04,157 --> 02:23:07,692
Thirty gallons, Mr. Garfield.
That's all there was left in all the tanks.

1693
02:23:07,828 --> 02:23:09,951
Too little to really measure.

1694
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:16,872
Tell this man we must have
reservations on the plane,

1695
02:23:17,004 --> 02:23:18,166
first thing tomorrow morning.

1696
02:23:18,297 --> 02:23:21,333
We'll miss Elvira's party.
It's important to you.

1697
02:23:21,467 --> 02:23:23,709
What's Elvira's party
got to do with sled dogs?

1698
02:23:23,844 --> 02:23:25,837
Really, darling. Don't be tiresome.

1699
02:23:25,971 --> 02:23:29,921
We might as well play safe until you find
out how things are going to turn out.

1700
02:23:30,059 --> 02:23:31,636
All right, Lydia.

1701
02:24:13,979 --> 02:24:15,307
Hello, Pete.

1702
02:24:15,814 --> 02:24:18,934
Meet us out front.
We're going for our steaks.

1703
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:25,189
Ten minutes, Mr. Briscoe,
I'll be there for sure.

1704
02:25:13,706 --> 02:25:15,498
-Hi.
-Hi, Mr. Garfield.

1705
02:25:18,962 --> 02:25:21,832
-I think your wife's waiting for you.
-Yeah.

1706
02:25:22,757 --> 02:25:26,458
I don't want to keep her
standing too long. We're expecting.

1707
02:25:26,886 --> 02:25:29,923
When you get rested, call me.
We'll have a talk.

1708
02:25:30,432 --> 02:25:32,590
Yeah, sure.

1709
02:25:37,606 --> 02:25:38,934
Good night.

1710
02:25:40,108 --> 02:25:41,437
Good night.

1711
02:25:44,946 --> 02:25:46,904
Good night, Mr. Garfield.

1712
02:25:52,621 --> 02:25:54,993
-Souvenir?
-For my wife.

1713
02:25:55,874 --> 02:25:58,745
I guess the rain won't hurt it,
better get it home though.

1714
02:25:58,877 --> 02:26:01,249
Susie will be waiting. Good night.

1715
02:26:13,851 --> 02:26:17,434
Well, I guess I better get going.
Little past my bedtime.

1716
02:26:17,813 --> 02:26:19,722
You had 30 gallons left.

1717
02:26:21,776 --> 02:26:22,855
Yeah.

1718
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:26,811
Good night. We'll get together soon.

1719
02:26:28,115 --> 02:26:29,444
Sure, chum.

1720
02:26:42,255 --> 02:26:43,500
So long.

1721
02:26:45,633 --> 02:26:48,551
So long, you ancient pelican.
