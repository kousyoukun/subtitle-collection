1
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:56,210
Hey, fella.

2
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,010
Ain't you Dan Roman?

3
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:02,853
Yeah.

4
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,714
I heard you whistling and I said to myself...

5
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,848
only one guy does that just so.

6
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,361
I'd know that ugly face of yours anywhere.

7
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,089
But you don't remember me, I bet you.

8
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:14,926
Sure I do. Ben Sneed.

9
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:18,930
I thought you'd be milking cows
somewheres on your own....

10
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,902
I mean, I thought you'd quit flying.

11
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,766
I thought you'd stay away from these things.

12
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:30,941
They're only a hunk of metal.
They don't go no place in particular.

13
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:33,744
I guess I just haven't got
much willpower, Ben.

14
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,887
- What are you up to?
- Crew chiefing with Far East.

15
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,621
It's a good job.

16
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:47,194
I gotta go, Dan.

17
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:52,666
- I just thought I'd say hello.
- Sure. Good luck.

18
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,725
- Either one of you know that man?
- Sure looks old for a copilot.

19
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:22,390
- Didn't know we were so hard up.
- He weren't always a copilot.

20
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,030
We used to call him "Whistling Dan."

21
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,633
One of the finest men you'd ever know.

22
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:31,907
And the most miserable.
He was down in Colombia same time I was.

23
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,868
He's taking off one night with a full load...

24
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:39,348
and one of them South American line squalls
decided to hit the field at the same time.

25
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:43,011
The wind shifts too late for him to stop
and he don't quite make it over...

26
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,747
a little hill at the end of the field.

27
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:46,880
I remember that one.
Right after the war, right?

28
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,586
Yeah. Dan hits flap,
but the ship breaks in half...

29
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:52,992
and there's nothing but fire in 10 seconds.

30
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,156
Dan gets tossed
through the cockpit window...

31
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:58,360
and only gets a few scratches
plus that game leg of his.

32
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:02,762
Which leaves him alive to blame himself.
Everybody else gets killed.

33
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:05,742
Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.

34
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:07,902
It don't work out quite that way.

35
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:12,046
I knew two of the passengers.
They were off to the coast for a holiday.

36
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:16,442
Blonde girl, name of Mary
and a little boy, name of Tony.

37
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:20,154
Everybody thought
they were wonderful people...

38
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,724
including Dan Roman.

39
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:28,558
Mary was Dan's wife
and little Tony was his only kid.

40
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,668
Yup.

41
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:37,063
Dan is the only guy I ever knew
who had guts enough not to commit suicide.

42
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:56,052
<i>Flight 21 now arriving,</i>
<i>Gate 1, from Los Angeles.</i>

43
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:08,969
<i>Miss Betty Emsley,</i>
<i>please report to the information desk.</i>

44
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,907
Nice to have you with us, Mr. Flaherty.
Please check with immigration now.

45
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,210
You'll board in about 30 minutes.

46
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,254
This is Miss Spalding, your stewardess.

47
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,561
- I'll be in the bar.
- We'll call you, Mr. Flaherty.

48
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,094
Trouble.

49
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,439
- Mr. and Mrs. Joseph?
- Yes, sirree.

50
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:50,206
The Waikiki kids. Just put us down
as a float for the Rose Bowl parade.

51
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,976
- Your age, Mr. Joseph?
- Today?

52
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,286
No, I'm 38, so help me.

53
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:58,685
- Birthplace?
- Passaic, New Jersey.

54
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:01,519
That's the Garden State.
Motto: Liberty and prosperity.

55
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,991
Bounded on the north by New York,
on the south by--

56
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:08,326
- And Mrs. Joseph?
- Shall I tell him? I'm 33...

57
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,962
and I was born in Ogden, Utah.

58
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,363
Thank you, immensely.

59
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:15,630
Aloha.

60
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,479
- Hey, look. Remember?
- Yeah.

61
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:33,283
My name is Sally McKee. I'm 30 years old.

62
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,285
I was born in Riverside, California.

63
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:39,894
- You're still a United States citizen?
- Yes, of course.

64
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:43,461
Thank you, Miss McKee.
Please check with immigration.

65
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,070
Your flight will be announced.

66
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,438
She may be put together
with paste and flour...

67
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,535
but that woman has something.
What would you say it was?

68
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,410
Practice. Plenty of practice.

69
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,148
- Aren't you--
- Yes, I'm Gustave Pardee.

70
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:06,017
I've enjoyed your New York shows
very much.

71
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,249
Good. Delighted.

72
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:08,620
Here are our tickets.

73
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:11,593
I'm 47 and I was born in New York City.

74
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,257
Mrs. Pardee?

75
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,199
I'm 30,
and I was born in Owosso, Michigan.

76
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,870
- How will the weather be?
- Fine, Mr. Pardee.

77
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,030
You should have a very pleasant trip.

78
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,946
He looks like a tired walrus on a rock.

79
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:33,813
She looks like she's done all right
for a slender redhead from Owosso.

80
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,610
- Ken Childs, 53. Born in Philadelphia.
- Yes, Mr. Childs.

81
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:42,089
I don't know where my luggage is.
The Royal was supposed to send it down.

82
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:43,454
We'll check right into it, sir.

83
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,960
May I introduce your stewardess,
Miss Spalding.

84
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:47,724
Hello, sister. New here, aren't you?

85
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,822
Four months now with the company,
Mr. Childs.

86
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,494
Good. I don't know where they get
some of the girls...

87
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:55,733
but things are improving.

88
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:00,235
One of the few men who has ever made
any real money out of aviation.

89
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:03,211
He's one of our stockholders.
Treat him accordingly.

90
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,543
If you please.

91
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,214
- Dorothy Chen?
- Yes.

92
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,523
- Born in Antung, Manchuria?
- Yes, but I am Korean.

93
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,358
You have your passport handy, of course.

94
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,229
Please take it to immigration.
It's just over there.

95
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:23,795
It's a real pleasure
to have you with us, Miss Chen.

96
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,163
Thank you, sir.

97
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,198
- That face.
- A moon and a willow tree.

98
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:37,007
<i>West Airlines, Flight 7 from San Francisco...</i>

99
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,775
<i>now arriving, Gate 11.</i>

100
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:43,646
I'm sorry I'm late, Skipper.
I got hung up buying a present for my wife.

101
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:46,454
Susie will sure be excited
when she sees this.

102
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:47,524
Yeah.

103
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,419
I already been up to Weather.
The winds aren't too bad.

104
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:51,721
Let's try 9,000 for a change.

105
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,956
I'll have a flight plan in 15 minutes, Skipper.

106
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,055
I hope Susie likes this tray.

107
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:02,804
3,050 gallons be all right
for takeoff, Captain?

108
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:05,500
Sounds all right,
let's see what Leonard says.

109
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:09,769
It looks about 12 hours and 16 minutes,
if these winds are anywhere near correct.

110
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,848
Okay, 30-50 takeoff.

111
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:15,077
<i>West Airlines, Flight 7 from San Francisco...</i>

112
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,050
<i>now arriving, Gate 11.</i>

113
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:19,918
Say, Skipper, how old would you say
Dan Roman is?

114
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:26,857
He was flying planes before I was born.
Look at it yourself.

115
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:30,158
He flew the airmail in the open-cockpit days.

116
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,959
I think he learned to fly
in the first World War.

117
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:36,434
And endurance flights, racing,
old-time barnstorming.

118
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,970
Ten or 15 years with Transworld.

119
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,268
In the second World War, he flew a bomber
in the Ploiesti oilfield raid.

120
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:46,612
He took his cracks at Germany in B-17s...

121
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:50,244
finally wound up with a B-29 squad
into Okinawa.

122
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,523
I'll just lay you a bet
he's got better than 20,000 hours.

123
00:10:56,726 --> 00:11:00,163
- It sure is embarrassing.
- What's embarrassing?

124
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,995
He's got so much time and all.

125
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,638
They must've been out of their heads
to hire an old fire-horse like him.

126
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,971
Why not let him graze in the pasture?

127
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,275
- All ready, Lennie?
- All set to sign, Skipper.

128
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,746
<i>Attention, please.</i>

129
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:22,312
<i>Mrs. Helen Bell,</i>
<i>please report to the ticket office.</i>

130
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,123
Me, too.

131
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:30,320
Twenty-one souls onboard. The rest, cargo.

132
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,528
73,000 pounds gross.

133
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,127
I said it to Orville, I said it to Wilbur,
and I say it to you...

134
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,631
the thing will never leave the ground.

135
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:46,442
You may rely on Miss Spalding
to take good care of your son, Mr. Fields.

136
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:49,205
He's not the first young man
to cross the ocean alone.

137
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,372
It will be quite an adventure for him.

138
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,348
He's, unfortunately,
quite an experienced traveler.

139
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,979
His mother will meet him in San Francisco.
She's brunette, and quite beautiful.

140
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:03,820
If you'll wait at Gate 4, Mr. Fields,
you may put Tobey aboard yourself.

141
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:04,983
Thank you.

142
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:11,794
Come on, Tobey, let's go.

143
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:22,670
<i>Flight 1-4 from Los Angeles</i>
<i>arriving, Gate 11.</i>

144
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,369
What are you looking at?

145
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,813
<i>Attention, please.</i>

146
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,851
You suppose it'll ever happen to me?

147
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:37,921
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but where can I send a cable?

148
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,893
Just across from the souvenir stand.

149
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:42,522
You're sure about our connecting
with that New York plane?

150
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:45,158
You'll make it with time to spare, Mr. Rice.

151
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,494
We'll make it with time to spare.

152
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:51,369
That little lady had a grandfather
who left her both brains and riches.

153
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:54,410
She bought her husband
an advertising agency not long ago...

154
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,103
because he wanted a new toy.

155
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,680
How do you know these things?

156
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,147
I used to be a night clerk in a Nevada hotel.

157
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:03,014
<i>Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.</i>

158
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,986
- Mr. Locota?
- Yeah, that's me.

159
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,491
I'm a fisherman.

160
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:17,567
My family should be in fishermen
for a couple of hundred years...

161
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,363
maybe more, I don't know.

162
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,903
The fish, they don't school up here...

163
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:25,941
like on the coast of California.

164
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,443
So, I'm gonna go back
to San Francisco now.

165
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,637
Thank you, Mr. Locota.

166
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:31,873
Your plane will be announced
in a few minutes.

167
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,450
Don't you want us
to check that through for you?

168
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,317
But I got in here my things
for to eat for the trip.

169
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:41,117
You've hurt my feelings, Mr. Locota.

170
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,159
Did you think you wouldn't eat my lunch,
or the steak we're gonna have for dinner?

171
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:48,698
Ma'am, miss,
I don't know about these things.

172
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:53,264
I never fly before.
I don't want to make no trouble for nobody.

173
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,464
- Serving you will be a pleasure, Mr. Locota.
- Thank you.

174
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,268
Just a minute, Mr. Locota. There you are.

175
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:06,505
Thank you. Excuse me very much.

176
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:12,778
You didn't know all about that little man.

177
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:15,881
The ticketing sheet had nothing on him
except statistics.

178
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,256
I'm afraid he falls into
the "nobody" category.

179
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:21,889
He's gonna be more than a statistic to me.
I like him.

180
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:35,271
Oh, brother.
Will I be glad to get on that plane.

181
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:37,040
Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?

182
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,547
Listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.
But this place...

183
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,385
Coney Island with coconuts.

184
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:47,116
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take all the Hawaiian Islands--

185
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:53,852
Tobey, will you tell your mother
something for me?

186
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:58,960
Tell your mother that there shouldn't be
an ocean between us.

187
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:02,330
Tell her I wish
she'd come with you next time.

188
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,972
- Can you remember all that, Tobey?
- Yes, Daddy.

189
00:15:20,956 --> 00:15:22,788
I got him, Daddy. I got him.

190
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:59,290
- Everything okay, Dan?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

191
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,188
3,050 aboard.

192
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:05,826
There's a slight oil leak, Number 4.
Nothing to worry about.

193
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:07,528
How long does it look like?

194
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:10,367
Lennie says 12 hours and 15 minutes, about.

195
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,131
Twelve hours and 16 minutes exactly.

196
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:17,470
<i>Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.</i>

197
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:21,977
San Francisco. I must go to San Francisco.

198
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,111
Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.
You're not on the list.

199
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,452
Mr. Kenneth Childs is on your plane,
isn't he?

200
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:28,854
Why, yes. Mr. Childs--

201
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,985
Then you must have room.
I insist. I must go.

202
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:35,463
Very well, sir.
Fortunately we have space available today...

203
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:38,591
- if you're an American citizen.
- I am. I am for sure.

204
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:42,899
My name is Humphrey Agnew.
I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.

205
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,304
Right here in Honolulu.
Perhaps you've heard?

206
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:49,606
- Yes. Do you have a travel card, Mr. Agnew?
- I pay cash for everything.

207
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:52,773
If you'll just step across the lobby
and check with immigration...

208
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:55,852
then come right back here,
we'll have your ticket ready, sir.

209
00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,916
Now, there goes a real quack.

210
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:02,753
He's made a fortune
selling Agnew's aids to better living.

211
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:03,848
What have you got?

212
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,327
Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness,
sticky liver?

213
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,830
Agnew has got a curing pill for all of them.

214
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:13,425
- So long, Alsop. Have fun.
- I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.

215
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:34,849
May I take your coat, Mrs. Pardee?

216
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,789
- You all right, Mr. Locota?
- Yes.

217
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:48,395
- We going to fly very high?
- 7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir...

218
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:49,733
depends on our clearance.

219
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:52,433
Wouldn't you like to sit
next to the window, Mr. Briscoe?

220
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,239
You know something, miss?
This is as far as the old carcass would go.

221
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,780
I'd rather look at you
than what's outside, anyhow.

222
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,407
Your seat belt isn't fastened. Shame on you.

223
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,716
My arm just won't bend around
the way it should.

224
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:11,691
- Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.
- I don't see any holes.

225
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:14,494
You know something, miss? Neither do I.

226
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:25,867
Would you like me to take your leis,
put them in a cool place?

227
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:26,965
They'll keep better.

228
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:30,274
Now, that's just about the smartest idea
anybody ever had.

229
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,274
Gotta keep them as long as we can.

230
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:36,177
Gotta get back
to the old salt mines tomorrow.

231
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,410
Get the nose to the grindstone.

232
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:42,157
That's Hawaiian for "thank you."

233
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:46,759
Let me tell you something.
If we get into any trouble...

234
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,689
any serious trouble
that the pilot can't handle...

235
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,358
you just come to old Ed Joseph.

236
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:55,563
I'll be glad to go up there and help him
if he needs me.

237
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,172
- Got it?
- Got it.

238
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:07,842
All right, young man,
it's time to get you buckled down now.

239
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,312
Just make you nice and comfy here.

240
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,889
And the next thing you know
we'll be in the air, all right?

241
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,097
- Mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?
- I would be so pleased.

242
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,970
I am so happy you wish to sit next to me...

243
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:37,012
because I have been watching you
walk down the aisle...

244
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:40,015
and have the desire to say a thing to you.

245
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:45,819
It is that you are
the first real, alive American girl...

246
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,383
I have ever greeted in person.

247
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,355
You are so very beautiful.

248
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:56,121
I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one...

249
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,930
if all the girls in America...

250
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,594
are so beautiful and kind.

251
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:05,936
I don't think you're going to
have to worry about a thing.

252
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:11,502
Off.

253
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,445
- Wing flaps.
- Fifteen degrees.

254
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,245
- Mixture.
- Auto rich.

255
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,978
V1 and V2 speeds?

256
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:20,352
112, 116, that about does it.

257
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,516
- Check the radios, Dan?
- Yeah.

258
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,957
420 ready for takeoff.

259
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:27,662
Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.

260
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,288
When you have time, I wish you'd come
back and talk to one of my passengers.

261
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:09,365
All right.

262
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:12,093
He's a Mr. Pardee,
big rumpled-looking man...

263
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:13,794
sitting halfway back on the right side.

264
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:16,565
Alsop said he had something to do
with the New York theater.

265
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,504
I suppose he wants to put you on the stage.

266
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:20,371
Call me if you need your honor defended.

267
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:22,967
And jump from the frying pan into the fire?

268
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,103
He's the original frightened Freddie.

269
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:29,151
Every time you bank or change
propeller pitch, he goes all white.

270
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:31,685
Grabs on his seat
like it was an electric chair.

271
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:33,278
Okay.

272
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,357
I thought you were going to quit smoking.

273
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:42,124
I did. I haven't smoked
in three hours and 20 minutes.

274
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:44,028
Go ahead, stain your teeth.

275
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:52,170
Come see me when you grow up, junior.

276
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:08,181
What in the world are you bawling about?

277
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,848
Have I done something to bring this on?

278
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:16,481
- Nell, cut it out.
- I'm trying to.

279
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,555
I just can't.

280
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:25,465
It's just, it's all over.

281
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:27,896
What's over?

282
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,901
Our honeymoon.

283
00:24:34,443 --> 00:24:37,140
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

284
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:41,777
Of course it does. It's not over
for another 12 hours or so.

285
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,419
And it never has to be
as far as I'm concerned.

286
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:48,656
Oh, Milo.

287
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:03,900
I'm scared.

288
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,970
I'm just plain scared.

289
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,638
What are you scared of? We've got
the whole world in front of us.

290
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:14,481
It's just that we're so young.

291
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:17,552
And just like you said...

292
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:21,550
we've got that whole big world down there.

293
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:24,518
- And you know what?
- What?

294
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:27,319
We've got to face it.

295
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:29,824
I thought you had confidence in me.

296
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,499
Of course I do.

297
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,035
It's just that...

298
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:46,479
all the rest of the people in the world
don't know you like I do.

299
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:54,746
Supposing I was going to have a baby
and you didn't have a job?

300
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:56,484
- You're not supposed--
- Suppose I was?

301
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,718
All right.

302
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,294
You're going to have a baby
and I haven't got a job...

303
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:02,887
there's no food in the apartment,
it's snowing outside...

304
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:05,365
and the sheriff's knocking on the door--

305
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:08,698
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

306
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:27,715
- Are you?
- Am I what?

307
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:29,892
Are you....

308
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:31,519
You know.

309
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,988
- Me?
- You.

310
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,559
Oh, Milo. No.

311
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,539
Whatever gave you such an idea?

312
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,509
I don't know.

313
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,626
Prof. Flaherty. Welcome.

314
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:19,097
Are we to believe you are at last resolved
to abandon the arts and return to science?

315
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,497
If so, we rejoice.

316
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:26,630
We have sorely missed your help and advice.

317
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:29,104
You're doing all right.

318
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:32,805
You'll find out how to blow up the world
all by your little selves.

319
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:37,152
It won't be long now and blooie.
Congratulations.

320
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:42,181
Professor, we all appreciate the fact
that you've been under enormous strain.

321
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:47,185
We deeply regret that a man of your caliber
no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.

322
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,456
Cooperate?

323
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,391
I had a seat on a nice little campus...

324
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,563
even if I wasn't making much money...

325
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,537
or my students didn't know
what I was talking about.

326
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,731
And I played pretty good golf...

327
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:02,277
and I slept nights.

328
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:05,780
I was happy because I figured
it was still God's business...

329
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,008
to monkey around with the universe.

330
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,952
He can fix a star
so it'll burn for a billion years.

331
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,581
Keep going and you'll find out
how to burn one up in a minute.

332
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:21,358
Did any of you ever bother
to look at the lagoon out there?

333
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,193
It's beautiful and blue...

334
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:27,794
and the people around it
are brown and kind...

335
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,538
and they did know how to laugh and sing.

336
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:34,537
Only now all the fishes
in the lagoon are dead.

337
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,608
And the people are scared forever.

338
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:40,044
They don't sing anymore.

339
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:42,841
You found a way to blow out a window...

340
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:46,046
65 miles away from the impact point.

341
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:50,620
Only, suppose there's a mother standing
in that window with a baby in her arms?

342
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:55,497
Professor...

343
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:59,462
I suggest you go to your tent
and rest for a while.

344
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:05,232
I'll arrange transport back to the States
for you at the earliest possible moment.

345
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,101
Yeah, do that.

346
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,711
I want to find a shepherd in the hills
or a mountain in the mist...

347
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,046
and paint their picture...

348
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:17,810
before it's too late.

349
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,797
So, you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

350
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:41,867
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

351
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,446
I've made almost 200 flights across here...

352
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,516
and I feel a lot safer
than if I were driving my car.

353
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:52,312
I've got a lovely wife and two kids,
another on the way.

354
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,946
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was safe.

355
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:58,026
You hedged, Captain.
You didn't answer my question.

356
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:00,052
Come now...

357
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:03,823
be a good honest fellow
and tell me exactly what frightened you?

358
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:11,462
They were technical incidents.
I don't think you'd understand, Mr. Pardee.

359
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,166
I understand perfectly.

360
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,844
For some reason,
you were afraid you wouldn't reach...

361
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:17,810
your Biblical span of life.

362
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:20,848
Which is precisely what's bothering me
at the moment.

363
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:24,010
I'm convinced I couldn't swim
from here to the nearest shore.

364
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,054
You won't have to swim, Mr. Pardee.

365
00:31:26,154 --> 00:31:28,521
Suppose one of your motors
ceases to function?

366
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:32,219
We'd just go back to Honolulu.
These ships fly beautifully on three engines.

367
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:34,694
If it should happen
beyond our point of no return...

368
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:36,662
we'd simply continue on to San Francisco.

369
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:40,224
Suppose two of your motors
became uninterested in further toil?

370
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:43,133
Each engine is entirely independent
of the other.

371
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:47,175
The chances of two quitting during
the same flight are one in several million.

372
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:49,608
Even if that should happen,
we could still fly...

373
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,771
lower and much slower, but we'd get there.

374
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,284
You are very reassuring.
Why is it I read about so many crashes?

375
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:01,621
The newspapers always exaggerate
the importance of an air accident.

376
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,318
It would be very important to me
if I were in one.

377
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:06,122
You won't be, Mr. Pardee.

378
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:09,829
Just relax. Enjoy your flight.

379
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:14,803
Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you
for just a minute.

380
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:19,365
It can only be a minute,
then I'll have to go back to work.

381
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,705
I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.

382
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,507
I used to work in reservations
for Pan American.

383
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:28,313
That's fine. I'm glad you decided
to try a flight with us.

384
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,314
Aren't there two exits to this plane?
One up forward...

385
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:34,116
- where you and the rest of the crew leave?
- Yes.

386
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:38,652
Could I leave the plane that way?
With you and the crew?

387
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:41,221
Please, it's very important to me.

388
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,189
It's not what you're thinking.
I am going to be met in San Francisco...

389
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:49,862
but not by the police or anybody else
who could get you into trouble.

390
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,872
It just wouldn't work.

391
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:13,184
Confused, Captain?

392
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,657
Why, no. That's you.

393
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:20,931
It was me, eight years ago.

394
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,771
A fellow in the States saw that picture.

395
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:27,803
He wrote me.

396
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,211
I was lonely, so I answered.

397
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:35,749
There were a lot of letters...

398
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:38,218
beautiful letters.

399
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,119
And then last month, I agreed to marry him.

400
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:49,289
I never got around to telling him
the picture was eight years old.

401
00:33:50,465 --> 00:33:52,991
I don't want to bore you with my troubles...

402
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:58,073
but that dream kept me sane
for a long time.

403
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:03,241
I know I'm a...

404
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,208
mess.

405
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,782
I'm so much older than he thinks I am.

406
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:14,556
But...

407
00:34:15,423 --> 00:34:17,517
if I could just see him...

408
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:23,595
and then leave without meeting him.

409
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,698
Please understand, Captain.

410
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:37,806
What you're asking is not exactly in my line.

411
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:42,745
Let me think it over. I'll let you know.

412
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:06,867
- Newspaper?
- No, thanks.

413
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:11,276
- How's AT&T?
- It's up a point.

414
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:16,546
I hope you don't mind,
I couldn't help watching you.

415
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:20,752
You remind me so much of a man
I once knew.

416
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:24,551
My name is Ken Childs
and I don't mind at all.

417
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:56,855
Fourteen minutes behind
on the last fix, Skipper.

418
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:57,926
So?

419
00:35:58,026 --> 00:36:00,757
We should make it up.
The wind seems to be shifting around.

420
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:01,830
Good.

421
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:06,224
You know it's nice having
a guy like Dan Roman up here.

422
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:09,064
For a change, I don't feel like a grandfather.

423
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,665
I was just saying to my wife the other day...

424
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:13,435
I never had it so good.

425
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,868
Easy job, no strain...

426
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:19,376
and I'm pretty lucky in having
a girl like Susie.

427
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:23,406
It makes all the difference in the world
what kind of a wife a guy has.

428
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:25,316
Don't you think so, Skipper?

429
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:30,250
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

430
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:33,785
I guess a lot of people do think it's funny...

431
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:36,691
because I do the dishes
and the cooking, too...

432
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:40,033
but they forget
how much younger Susie is than I am.

433
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:44,003
And as for an extra martini
once in a while....

434
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:47,007
<i>And so you'll please forgive me</i>
<i>another question, Captain.</i>

435
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,807
<i>Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?</i>

436
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:54,575
...it's spirit.
You know, she once called me....

437
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:55,650
<i>Are you?</i>

438
00:36:57,785 --> 00:37:01,586
<i>Are you now, for no reason at all...</i>

439
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:05,148
You wait till you see what she does
with that hardwood tray I bought her.

440
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:07,660
<i>...after almost 2 million miles...</i>

441
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:09,922
...maybe beside the little bar she bought...

442
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:11,055
<i>...afraid?</i>

443
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,963
...to keep herself company while I'm away.

444
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,968
She'll show it to everyone who drops in...

445
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,867
to keep her company when I'm away.

446
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,465
<i>But it's there.</i>

447
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:24,606
<i>It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.</i>

448
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:27,210
<i>You can almost touch it.</i>

449
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:29,776
She spent most of her time
riding around in it...

450
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:31,580
so she wouldn't get too lonesome.

451
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,945
Guess she drove a little too fast....

452
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:37,753
<i>It's come like it has to so many others</i>
<i>for no reason at all...</i>

453
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:38,982
And besides....

454
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:42,427
<i>...except maybe the wear and tear</i>
<i>of those 2 million miles.</i>

455
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,825
...because they look like they're going faster
than they really are.

456
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,994
Like what the bartender told me
last December...

457
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:51,966
when she was picked up
for being drunk in and about....

458
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:56,511
<i>They'll give you a certificate for those</i>
<i>2 million miles to hang on a wall at home.</i>

459
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:00,812
<i>Only, the certificate doesn't add up</i>
<i>to the wear and tear.</i>

460
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:04,242
...but the wrong word. It's spirit she's got.

461
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:07,312
<i>Dan knows about it.</i>

462
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:11,519
<i>All the old timers say it's only temporary...</i>

463
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,960
<i>like growing pains.</i>

464
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:17,156
Like this note she left me on my last trip.

465
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:20,661
<i>And now, it's here for no reason at all...</i>

466
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,833
<i>and you've got to fight it...</i>

467
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,300
<i>all alone.</i>

468
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:29,006
"Welcome home, fatso.

469
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,941
"Got sleepy and couldn't wait
so you take a taxi.

470
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:35,650
"Don't make any racket when you
come home banging around the kitchen...

471
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,187
"and don't wake me up
in the morning. Love, Susie."

472
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:42,881
What a sense of humor.

473
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,257
Someday, they're going to invent
a stool for navigators...

474
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:51,332
that'll come somewhere near
fitting the human frame.

475
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,002
Ask Hobie if he can't synchronize
the props a little better.

476
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:58,334
I don't know
whether it's Number 1 or Number 3...

477
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:01,568
but one of them keeps slipping out.
It's getting on my nerves.

478
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,666
Okay.

479
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:07,240
Skipper says, "What's the matter with you?
Can't you keep the props together?"

480
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:08,748
They are together.

481
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,884
Skipper says they're out of phase.

482
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:13,045
One and 2 are as smooth as silk.

483
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:15,623
- So are 3 and 4.
- So be it.

484
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:21,385
The boys say the props
couldn't be smoother.

485
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:23,822
Yeah?

486
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,435
Well, there's something haywire.

487
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,184
Are you all right, Mr. Briscoe?

488
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:44,677
All right?

489
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:48,246
Little girl, I'm getting along like $10 million.

490
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:51,315
Can I get you something?

491
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,951
Perhaps a cup of tea
would taste good to you.

492
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:59,232
- What was that?
- It's 5:00.

493
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:03,165
- You mean it chimes?
- You heard it.

494
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:06,469
Funny thing. It happens to be
the last possession...

495
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:09,169
I haven't signed over to someone else.

496
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,702
I wish it would chime again.

497
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,610
What a wonderful way
to keep track of the time.

498
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:19,050
If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait
for the next hour to come...

499
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,416
and then the next one.

500
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:23,355
You know something?
I used to feel the same way.

501
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:26,985
But right now I'm in no hurry
for the hours to pass.

502
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:32,156
No, the watch is yours.
I want you to have it.

503
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,735
- I couldn't think of accepting it.
- Please.

504
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:37,532
A watch is the last thing I'm going to need.

505
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:40,601
I'd like to think of it
marking the kind of hours...

506
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,574
only a young girl can have...

507
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,075
exciting hours.

508
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:47,141
You'll make me very happy if you'll accept it.

509
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,646
Well, if you put it that way.

510
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,810
I can't thank you.

511
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,682
I've never met anyone like you...

512
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,486
yet I shall remember you
for the rest of my life.

513
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:00,755
I'd rather you remember
it's only a possession...

514
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,056
and so, not worth very much.

515
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:05,133
I will, always.

516
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:09,927
We can hear it chime together again,
it needs setting, you know.

517
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:14,773
- It's 7:00 in San Francisco.
- Sure. I forgot.

518
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:26,279
Is it really 7:00, little girl?

519
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:28,151
As far as this airplane is concerned.

520
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:31,384
Then you know something?
I don't want tea or coffee.

521
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:34,388
- A glass of water?
- Water is for bathing...

522
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:37,698
but if you can put some Scotch in it,
I'll feel cleaner.

523
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:38,800
Yes, sir.

524
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,958
- It's way past my cocktail time.
- Right now.

525
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:44,334
How about my friend over there?
Will you join me for a drink, mister?

526
00:41:44,438 --> 00:41:47,067
Yes, thank you very much.

527
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:53,345
That's awful nice music.

528
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:02,241
We picked up four minutes, Skipper.

529
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:05,751
Looks like that wind
is finally swinging around now.

530
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:06,821
Good.

531
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,555
I may pass a miracle and hit San Francisco
right on time.

532
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:15,085
- Have a Lifesaver, Skipper?
- No, thanks.

533
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:20,334
Let me know, will you, when we pass
the point of no return?

534
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:24,828
Naturally.

535
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:51,361
Lydia, if you're through pouting...

536
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:54,660
maybe we could try talking things over
in a reasonable manner.

537
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,964
We have nothing to talk over.

538
00:43:57,071 --> 00:44:00,064
Anyone who would sell
a New York advertising agency...

539
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:02,700
- for a broken-down mine in Canada...
- It isn't broken.

540
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,008
...just to make yourself feel important,
the big operator.

541
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:07,679
Operating on my money.

542
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:11,411
I just want to get up with the feeling
that anything I accomplish that day...

543
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:13,044
is due to my own efforts.

544
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:15,817
Not because my wife happened
to inherit a business.

545
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:18,791
In three years I should be able
to pay you back. Every penny.

546
00:44:18,893 --> 00:44:22,386
Three years in the wilderness
and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin...

547
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:25,830
with my skirts around my ankles
when they ought to be around my knees...

548
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:28,061
or the other way around.

549
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:33,373
For the last time, Lydia,
I'm asking you to come with me.

550
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:36,876
I'm glad it's the last time
you're going to make that insane request...

551
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:38,946
so I won't have to say no again.

552
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,647
I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.

553
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:43,149
You're out of your head.

554
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,481
What am I supposed to do
while you clump around...

555
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:47,282
in your boots and lumberjack shirt?

556
00:44:47,388 --> 00:44:51,553
Have cocktails with the chipmunks?
Play bridge with the Eskimos?

557
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,386
Go on off to your primeval forest.
Play Daniel Boone...

558
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:58,933
get up with the pigeons or whatever
kind of birds they have up there.

559
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,558
Get calluses on your hands.

560
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:03,297
Be a great dirt-under-the-fingernails boy.

561
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:06,602
Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.

562
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,977
Take a bath Saturday nights
and go to an Eskimo hoedown.

563
00:45:10,077 --> 00:45:11,841
Teach them to samba, for all I care.

564
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:15,383
Do just as you please
if it will make you feel like a man.

565
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:18,751
Only don't ask me to share
your juvenile adventures.

566
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:21,286
It's bad enough having to pay for them.

567
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:25,117
- Is that your last word?
- No.

568
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:29,694
I've always felt your brain
would fit nicely in a demitasse.

569
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:36,933
Hey, fella.
You got nothing but trouble, right?

570
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:40,540
- I assure you--
- I know what you're going to say...

571
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:42,576
everything with you is hunky-dory.

572
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:45,669
That's the first thing a fella
in trouble always says.

573
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:49,949
The booby hatches are full of people
that keep things to themselves...

574
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,610
either because they're scared
to tell them the truth...

575
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,019
thinking they'll make a monkey
out of themselves...

576
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:59,355
or they figure no one else can appreciate
the situation they're in. Okay?

577
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:02,529
Well, the Good Neighbors
believe that ain't so.

578
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,262
- And just who--
- A club I belong to back home.

579
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,532
It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.

580
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:12,170
Their luncheons are a riot.

581
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:15,908
Over the speaker's desk,
they've got a great big towel...

582
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,811
with the letters "For Crying Out Loud"
embroidered on it.

583
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:23,015
And every member
has his own crying towel, get it?

584
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:27,479
When they bring in a bad case,
a couple of the Good Neighbors...

585
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:31,116
hold the towel for the fella
so he can concentrate on weeping...

586
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:34,354
and then don't have to exert himself
in any other way.

587
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:38,989
It turns out to be a good
old-fashioned revival meeting...

588
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:43,070
and the fella who has
no particular worries at the time...

589
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:46,203
he sort of feels left out of things.

590
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:51,178
And if this fella don't actually wind up
laughing at himself...

591
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,974
at least he feels better.

592
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:55,612
The main thing is, everybody does...

593
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:58,043
because nine times out of 10...

594
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:01,213
they think they're better off
than the other fella.

595
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,925
What do you sing at the end
of your meetings?

596
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:07,392
<i>Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag?</i>

597
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:08,826
How'd you guess?

598
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:11,764
When a fella comes in with real trouble...

599
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:14,096
like he can't pay his income taxes...

600
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:16,999
or his wife just smashed up the car...

601
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:22,400
or his new house
shows cracks along the foundation...

602
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:28,143
they've got an organ that plays
real sad music.

603
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,006
It's a kick.

604
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,113
I can see how it might be.

605
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:35,551
Of course, a fella never comes in...

606
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:37,820
with real troubles.

607
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,286
You know, like...

608
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,760
the guy's wife dying...

609
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,195
or his business really going broke.

610
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:47,933
They just confess little problems...

611
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:51,301
like who are they gonna get
to mow the lawn...

612
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:54,637
or will they ever break 100
on the golf course?

613
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,810
It's all relative, see.

614
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:01,112
You get the habit of laughing
at little problems...

615
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,843
when they come along...

616
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,010
and then you don't blow your top...

617
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,022
when the genuine, serious things happen.
Get it?

618
00:48:10,257 --> 00:48:12,954
Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, Mr....

619
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,655
Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.

620
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,867
Getting back to your case,
maybe it'd make you feel better...

621
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,731
if I cried some.

622
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:27,235
Then you'd understand
what the Good Neighbor means.

623
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:32,711
Imagine yourself with a towel.

624
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:39,253
Ready?

625
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:43,419
The wife and I scrimped
for over four years...

626
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:45,322
to take a trip to Hawaii.

627
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:50,294
You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand...

628
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:53,330
things we ain't got at home.

629
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:58,466
We dreamed of the day
that we were to leave.

630
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,641
<i>So, the wife persuades a woman</i>
<i>to take care of our children...</i>

631
00:49:02,743 --> 00:49:04,371
<i>for $10 a day...</i>

632
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:08,677
<i>which is more than I made</i>
<i>the first five years we were married.</i>

633
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:15,347
<i>We got all unpacked and were really living...</i>

634
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:20,421
<i>but the ship don't sail. Strike or something.</i>

635
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:24,259
<i>But all right, we're lucky.</i>
<i>We get the last two tickets on an airplane...</i>

636
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,833
<i>and although we can't take all our luggage...</i>

637
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:29,165
<i>we're in the land of our dreams.</i>

638
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:32,296
<i>At the little hotel that fits our budget...</i>

639
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:34,431
<i>there's a mix-up in the reservations.</i>

640
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:37,670
<i>Another couple named Joseph</i>
<i>from Milwaukee.</i>

641
00:49:37,778 --> 00:49:40,976
<i>So we figure</i>
<i>maybe they've had a dream, too.</i>

642
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:43,209
<i>So we don't start any arguments.</i>

643
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:49,481
<i>We finally wind up at a hotel</i>
<i>which is way beyond our budget.</i>

644
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,354
<i>So we have to cut our trip short.</i>

645
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,156
<i>Okay? Comes evening...</i>

646
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:01,326
<i>the wife gets into the one evening dress</i>
<i>she could bring along...</i>

647
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:04,428
<i>and I get into a tux</i>
<i>I haven't had on in 10 years.</i>

648
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,573
Mommy!

649
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,016
<i>We were ready for the light fantastic.</i>

650
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:27,890
<i>The wife was wearing new shoes with heels</i>
<i>much higher than she was used to and....</i>

651
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,363
My back.

652
00:50:37,638 --> 00:50:41,268
<i>The house doctor says the wife</i>
<i>has twisted her sacroiliac...</i>

653
00:50:41,508 --> 00:50:44,068
<i>which ends the dancing for the trip.</i>

654
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:55,352
<i>So everything passes.</i>

655
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:59,321
<i>In a couple of days the wife is well enough</i>
<i>to hobble down to the beach.</i>

656
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:14,674
<i>It rains bullfrogs for three straight days.</i>

657
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:18,072
<i>All we got to do is sit around</i>
<i>and write postcards back home...</i>

658
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:21,012
<i>about what a wonderful time we're having.</i>

659
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:31,120
<i>Three days we got left,</i>
<i>then we meet the Wilsons.</i>

660
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:34,456
<i>One of the pleasures of any trip</i>
<i>should be the people you meet, right?</i>

661
00:51:34,561 --> 00:51:37,326
<i>The Wilsons had their own ideas</i>
<i>of what was fun.</i>

662
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:41,664
<i>He thought my wife was his dish,</i>
<i>and she thought I was Clark Gable.</i>

663
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:10,387
<i>The wife can't run very fast</i>
<i>on account of her sacroiliac.</i>

664
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,193
<i>I'm having my own track meet.</i>

665
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:17,830
<i>Fella, you have never lived...</i>

666
00:52:17,938 --> 00:52:21,568
<i>until you've been chased around</i>
<i>the palm tree by that guy's wife.</i>

667
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:27,206
<i>So we spend the rest of our dream trip</i>
<i>eating away from the hotel...</i>

668
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:31,376
<i>so we don't run into these people</i>
<i>and have to play post office all the time.</i>

669
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:34,778
<i>But the last day the sun comes out.</i>

670
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:38,481
<i>Whoever heard of coming home</i>
<i>from a dream trip without a tan?</i>

671
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:43,428
<i>We're desperate, see?</i>
<i>We really soaked up that sun, all day.</i>

672
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,063
The wife has a third-degree burn
on her shoulders.

673
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:56,936
I don't dare put any weight on my back.

674
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,305
I'm gonna have to borrow money
from the bank...

675
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:03,180
to pay next month's food bill,
if we ever do get home.

676
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:08,050
If you still think you got troubles, mister....

677
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:15,095
Wonder if you and Mrs. Joseph
would care to join me in a drink?

678
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:19,231
You can have your towel back now.

679
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,849
Take a breather, Dan.
I'll turn the knobs awhile.

680
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:45,892
Good, I could use a little shuteye.

681
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:52,031
Funny thing how a fella can sleep
with four big engines hollering in his ears...

682
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,895
only wake up when they stop hollering.

683
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,998
Imagine silence waking you up at home?

684
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:03,341
No human being should have to put up
with such an arrangement.

685
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,102
<i>San Francisco tollsman, 2930.</i>

686
00:54:30,203 --> 00:54:32,434
I don't care if you did build
that radio yourself.

687
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:33,837
It's against the law.

688
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,568
Throw it overboard before I do.

689
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:40,204
But I like to listen to the airplanes.
I spent a long time building that set.

690
00:54:40,847 --> 00:54:44,443
You touch my set and I'll kill you.
I might do it anyway.

691
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:47,552
Just to have something happen
on this rust bucket.

692
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:50,783
You're going off your rocker.
You need six months ashore.

693
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:55,253
Being shipmates with you is enough
to drive anybody off their rocker.

694
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:56,955
Get out of here.

695
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,900
Don't say I didn't warn you.

696
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:05,200
The FCC will jerk your license in a minute
if you send anything on that pile of junk.

697
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:06,534
Get out of here.

698
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,372
<i>Hello, Honolulu.</i>
<i>This is 420 with a position report.</i>

699
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,878
Come on, Honolulu. Wake up. Answer him.

700
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:15,175
<i>420, this is San Francisco...</i>

701
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:18,081
<i>Honolulu unable to read you</i>
<i>on account of poor conditions.</i>

702
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:19,876
<i>Go ahead with your report.</i>

703
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:23,115
<i>Okay, San Francisco. Copy, Honolulu.</i>

704
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:25,484
<i>Position at 0557.</i>

705
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:27,718
<i>Latitude 34/30 north.</i>

706
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:31,791
<i>Longitude 140 west, 9,000 feet.</i>

707
00:55:32,265 --> 00:55:34,734
<i>1,500 gallons remaining.</i>

708
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:56,149
<i>From the window at my side,</i>
<i>sometimes I can see the stars.</i>

709
00:55:57,157 --> 00:56:00,594
<i>America is all around me in every way.</i>

710
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,268
<i>Do you understand a funny thing?</i>

711
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:12,505
<i>In Honolulu, I must be inspected...</i>

712
00:56:12,606 --> 00:56:16,566
<i>by the American customs</i>
<i>and immigration persons.</i>

713
00:56:17,077 --> 00:56:20,047
<i>And not one soldier to guard things.</i>

714
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:25,076
<i>I look everywhere for soldiers</i>
<i>with guns and....</i>

715
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:28,545
Would you like your dinner now, Miss Chen?

716
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:32,023
Yes. Please, I am so stupid.

717
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,959
Here is a letter to my brother in English...

718
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:37,223
and I cannot remember this word.

719
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:41,926
It is that thing soldiers wear
at the end of their guns...

720
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:43,596
like a sword?

721
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:45,365
- Bayonet?
- Yes.

722
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:49,240
I am so very stupid. Thank you.

723
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:51,502
I am embarrassed.

724
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:54,171
Anyone who can write and read
more than one language...

725
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:55,874
should never be embarrassed.

726
00:56:55,982 --> 00:56:58,884
Being the original dumb-bunny,
I can barely write my own.

727
00:56:58,985 --> 00:57:00,044
"Dumb-bunny"?

728
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:03,351
That's slang for mentally-retarded
American girls like me.

729
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:05,048
Dumb-bunny.

730
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,328
How delightful.
I must tell my brother of this.

731
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:13,595
You tell him you met the number one
stupid rabbit.

732
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,260
If he knows any American girls,
he'll understand.

733
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:18,031
Now I'll get your dinner.

734
00:57:18,204 --> 00:57:19,638
Dumb-bunny.

735
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:51,969
There's something very wrong back there.
The tray--

736
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:53,768
- I know.
- A whole tray jumped.

737
00:57:53,873 --> 00:57:56,809
- I burned myself.
- I swear it's that Number 1 engine.

738
00:57:57,277 --> 00:58:00,406
It was running perfectly. They all are.

739
00:58:00,613 --> 00:58:04,573
Maybe it's in the tail. If our little girl
got burned, maybe it's worse back there.

740
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:07,279
Dan, take your flashlight,
have a look through the tail.

741
00:58:07,387 --> 00:58:09,379
- Report to me as soon as you can.
- Right.

742
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:11,253
Leonard, take a fast fix...

743
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,123
let me know our position now
and every 10 minutes from now.

744
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:15,855
Spalding, get back to your passengers.

745
00:58:15,962 --> 00:58:18,431
If this thing lets go again,
they'll start wondering.

746
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:21,399
Hobie, tell San Francisco
we're experiencing...

747
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:24,437
some unusual vibration
and to stand by until further advised.

748
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:26,904
Do you want to declare an emergency?

749
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:31,375
No, not yet.

750
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:26,259
- Is everything all right?
- We're still in one piece.

751
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:29,234
I was just starting to serve the passengers.
Should I go ahead?

752
00:59:29,335 --> 00:59:30,701
You might as well.

753
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:34,466
Sometimes these things
never do get explained.

754
00:59:43,016 --> 00:59:44,678
Say, hang up a minute, will you?

755
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:46,912
Tell me what's wrong with this airplane.

756
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,081
- Is there something wrong with it?
- Cut it out.

757
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:53,319
Something popped so hard a while ago,
it spilled my drink.

758
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:56,690
Order another. We're not stingy.

759
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:58,430
You won't talk?

760
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:00,996
I would if there was anything to say.

761
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:05,233
I'll make you a bet right now,
we're late getting into San Francisco.

762
01:00:07,006 --> 01:00:08,304
Could be.

763
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:18,874
- Did you find anything?
- Nope.

764
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:21,750
- What do you suppose it could it be?
- Beats me. Where are we?

765
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:23,824
I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.

766
01:00:23,923 --> 01:00:25,448
Nothing wrong with the tail.

767
01:00:25,558 --> 01:00:29,461
The Number 1 head temperature
has gone up five degrees in the past hour.

768
01:00:31,097 --> 01:00:33,498
San Francisco wants to know
the nature of our trouble.

769
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,592
Tell them if we knew, we'd have told them.

770
01:00:35,702 --> 01:00:37,500
No, don't say that. Tell them....

771
01:00:37,604 --> 01:00:39,903
Just say we still don't know
and to keep standing by.

772
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:43,443
I got news for you guys.
We just passed the point of no return.

773
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:08,692
- Have you lost something, Mr. Agnew?
- My lighter is out of fluid.

774
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:17,999
Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship...

775
01:02:18,104 --> 01:02:20,801
and is trying to work up an appetite
for dinner.

776
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:24,442
I seen a crazy man act like that once.
It ain't so nice.

777
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:26,407
He's looking for trouble.

778
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:36,589
You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?
Well, isn't that your name?

779
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,188
Yeah. Why? I don't think we've met before.

780
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:43,421
No. We've not met
because no one wanted us to.

781
01:02:44,964 --> 01:02:46,796
What can I do for you?

782
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:48,992
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

783
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,566
Well, does that mean anything to you?

784
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,235
- Agnew. You're Martha's husband.
- I am.

785
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:02,875
I didn't hear you say
you were pleased to meet me.

786
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,609
- Of course--
- Of course not!

787
01:03:08,187 --> 01:03:11,817
Look, Mr. Agnew, this lady and I
are having a quiet drink together.

788
01:03:11,991 --> 01:03:16,224
You seem to be disturbed about something.
Perhaps we can talk later. If you'll excuse--

789
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:19,925
No, you don't just snap your fingers
and send me on my way.

790
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,362
Mr. Agnew, I don't know what's eating you,
and frankly, I don't care.

791
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,531
Why don't you go back
wherever you came from and sit down.

792
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,508
- Now, honey.
- This man's a nuisance.

793
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:32,769
I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.

794
01:03:32,879 --> 01:03:34,814
I must have been
an even greater nuisance...

795
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:37,941
when you and my wife were scheming
to avoid me in Honolulu...

796
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:41,078
- so you could be alone.
- You're right out of your head.

797
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:45,592
I took your wife to lunch twice
because she was a very nice girl.

798
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:48,989
And a long time ago
she happened to work for me.

799
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:51,996
The worst crime she is guilty of
is shaking my hand.

800
01:03:52,131 --> 01:03:55,727
Now stop insulting her
and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.

801
01:03:55,902 --> 01:03:58,701
I knew you'd have some fancy explanation.

802
01:03:58,871 --> 01:04:02,330
But I'm not such a fool
as you and my wife think I am.

803
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:06,112
I'm going to let you wonder
what I'm going to do.

804
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:10,081
Wonder and think and think,
as I've been doing.

805
01:04:10,216 --> 01:04:13,812
I've heard about you for years
and I'm sick of the sound your name.

806
01:04:13,953 --> 01:04:16,445
You're quite a conqueror
with the ladies, aren't you?

807
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:18,582
That should interest you, madam.

808
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:21,957
- I've had enough of this.
- What's the matter with you guys?

809
01:04:22,061 --> 01:04:24,326
- Hey, what's this all about?
- Easy, break it up.

810
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,023
He's crazy, he's got a gun.

811
01:04:35,975 --> 01:04:37,637
We're on fire!

812
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:44,541
- Pull the bottle on it.
- Hobie, pull the bottle quick!

813
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:53,686
- Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco.
- San Francisco 420.

814
01:04:56,696 --> 01:05:00,224
- The prop! The whole prop is gone.
- Yes, and you may lose your engine, too.

815
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,962
- She's off her mountings.
- Pull the other bottle, Dan.

816
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:06,267
- I'm starting for the water.
- San Francisco 420.

817
01:05:19,685 --> 01:05:20,846
Thank you, sweet Lord.

818
01:05:20,953 --> 01:05:24,890
- I don't think she's gonna burn any more.
- I can't raise San Francisco. Static.

819
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,085
- Try the secondary frequency.
- I've tried both.

820
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:29,025
Use emergency. Give them a mayday call.

821
01:05:29,128 --> 01:05:30,687
- Are we going into the water?
- No.

822
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:32,857
She flies lousy
with that engine hanging down...

823
01:05:32,965 --> 01:05:34,433
but I think we can stay in the air.

824
01:05:34,534 --> 01:05:36,264
- How long to the coast?
- Six hours, about.

825
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:40,033
But at regular cruising speed.
I've not figured it out for this sort of thing.

826
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:41,198
Figure it!

827
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:42,275
...mayday 420.

828
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:46,110
Mayday 420, anybody.

829
01:05:48,047 --> 01:05:49,777
I got somebody. A ship.

830
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:54,684
This is the <i>Cristobal Trader</i> calling 420.
I can hear you very clearly.

831
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:58,114
You passed right over me
about 20 minutes ago.

832
01:05:58,224 --> 01:06:01,388
Do you want me to relay
all your messages? Over.

833
01:06:01,527 --> 01:06:05,396
Roger. Advise San Francisco
we've lost Number 1 propeller.

834
01:06:05,565 --> 01:06:07,466
Fire started but is now out.

835
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,001
We are now at 5,000, but sinking.

836
01:06:10,102 --> 01:06:13,129
Request they clear
all altitudes below us. Over.

837
01:06:13,272 --> 01:06:14,900
Will do. Stand by.

838
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:19,475
This is <i>Cristobal Trader</i>
calling San Francisco.

839
01:06:48,374 --> 01:06:51,344
Clear sea rescue from Oakland Control.

840
01:06:56,816 --> 01:06:57,784
Right.

841
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:05,457
<i>Warm up the ready plane. Intercept.</i>

842
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:31,876
San Francisco wants to know
if you are going to ditch. Over.

843
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:33,145
Negative for now.

844
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:36,051
What's the state of the sea
about you, just in case. Over.

845
01:07:36,155 --> 01:07:39,717
Heavy northwest swells.
We are rolling about 30 degrees.

846
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:43,421
It's very rough.
Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.

847
01:07:43,596 --> 01:07:45,997
It's wet down here. Over.

848
01:07:46,098 --> 01:07:48,499
Thank you, <i>Cristobal Trader.</i> We'll try.

849
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:50,660
Attaboy, papa.

850
01:07:56,275 --> 01:07:59,939
Some of these days, I'm gonna get smart
and go back to buttons.

851
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:01,708
- What's the poop?
- Eastbound lost a prop.

852
01:08:01,814 --> 01:08:04,716
Had a fire but that's out.
Looks like he's headed for the drink.

853
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:06,683
- How far out is he?
- 1,000 miles maybe.

854
01:08:06,786 --> 01:08:08,254
My aching eyes!

855
01:08:25,671 --> 01:08:29,870
This might well be my last show
and not a laugh in it.

856
01:08:30,276 --> 01:08:32,711
I shouldn't have screamed,
but I was so scared.

857
01:08:32,812 --> 01:08:35,543
My own heart is just returning
from the ceiling.

858
01:08:35,881 --> 01:08:39,409
Troubles? Wait till I tell
the Good Neighbors about this.

859
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:42,989
I was almost asleep
when someone pulled the champagne cork.

860
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:44,580
This could become interesting.

861
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:47,387
Things were pretty interesting
before this happened.

862
01:08:47,493 --> 01:08:49,257
Two apes were trying to kill each other.

863
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:51,831
Why don't you be a good boy
and go back and sit down.

864
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:53,729
I'm sure everything will be all right.

865
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,962
They'll come back from the flight deck
and explain in a minute.

866
01:08:57,069 --> 01:09:00,301
I'm just gonna keep this for you
till we make San Francisco.

867
01:09:00,406 --> 01:09:02,841
You can get in plenty trouble
with them things.

868
01:09:02,942 --> 01:09:05,138
I'll get coffee for everyone.

869
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:12,245
- Did you know space guns don't kill you?
- No.

870
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:14,081
They just make you stiff.

871
01:09:26,632 --> 01:09:28,965
You know, the funny part of all this...

872
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:32,572
is that for the first time
in my whole life, I'm innocent.

873
01:09:33,639 --> 01:09:36,700
What I told him was the truth, so help me.

874
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:49,415
This is gonna cost the taxpayers
a lot of money.

875
01:09:49,522 --> 01:09:51,457
What would you have them do? Swim home?

876
01:09:51,557 --> 01:09:54,652
No Alameda, this is the Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Center.

877
01:10:41,674 --> 01:10:43,267
- New position, Skipper!
- Name it!

878
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:46,368
To the coast, 5 hours, 47 minutes,
if we can hold this air speed.

879
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:49,506
- How's our fuel?
- Enough. Just.

880
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:53,618
We'll only need about 1,150 gallons,
we've 1,300 according to my graph.

881
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:56,553
- It's pinching things close--
- You can throw your graph away.

882
01:10:56,655 --> 01:10:59,591
- Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.
- How do you figure that?

883
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:03,925
The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons
when we lost our prop.

884
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:06,532
My guess is that when the prop left us...

885
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:09,101
it kicked holes in the wing.
Ruptured the tank.

886
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:13,138
We just can't make it this way.
I'll figure it up again, but the winds...

887
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:16,273
- maybe they'll change some.
- We're going into the drink.

888
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,469
It's just a question of when and where.

889
01:11:18,577 --> 01:11:22,571
We've got plenty of time. Let's not rush off
into the heat of the day about this.

890
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:24,775
Let's hold on a while
and see what the wind does.

891
01:11:24,884 --> 01:11:27,513
- We'll be closer to the coast.
- Water will be colder there.

892
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:32,024
And probably rougher, but I still think
we should stretch it out as long as we can.

893
01:11:32,124 --> 01:11:35,925
I'll go along with you on that.
It'll give us more time to get squared away.

894
01:11:36,028 --> 01:11:38,862
I want you up here with me
when we really start down.

895
01:11:38,964 --> 01:11:40,728
Meantime get everything you can overboard.

896
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:43,701
Thousand pounds or so
will make a difference in our speed.

897
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:46,796
You want me to tell them
they're going into the drink?

898
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,106
Use your own judgment.

899
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:22,073
I guess I don't have to tell you people
that we've had a little trouble.

900
01:12:22,408 --> 01:12:25,708
Maybe if I explain
exactly what has happened...

901
01:12:25,811 --> 01:12:28,474
you'll feel better all around.

902
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:29,910
I'm not gonna minimize it...

903
01:12:30,015 --> 01:12:33,918
nor will I make it any tougher
than it really is.

904
01:12:53,105 --> 01:12:55,870
We've lost our Number 1 propeller.

905
01:12:56,809 --> 01:13:01,509
This is just one of those things
that never happens but does...

906
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:03,981
once in a billion flying miles.

907
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,181
We've extinguished the fire
with the carbon dioxide...

908
01:13:07,286 --> 01:13:09,551
so there's no further danger from that.

909
01:13:09,655 --> 01:13:12,784
But our speed has been considerably
slowed down...

910
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,861
because the Number 1 motor
is partially twisted in its mountings...

911
01:13:17,129 --> 01:13:19,030
causing a severe drag...

912
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,327
sort of like dragging your feet in a rowboat.

913
01:13:26,038 --> 01:13:29,338
I can't blame you if you are a little scared,
I am, too.

914
01:13:29,842 --> 01:13:32,573
I've been flying since 1917...

915
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:35,910
and I don't like this sort of thing
any better than you do.

916
01:13:36,348 --> 01:13:38,783
However, with all that flying,
you'll notice that...

917
01:13:38,884 --> 01:13:41,012
I'm still very much alive.

918
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:47,654
Now comes the hard part.

919
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,389
- Can you take it?
- Please, tell us everything.

920
01:13:53,165 --> 01:13:54,963
I think we all want to know.

921
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:16,487
We're really very lucky. That propeller
could have done a great deal more damage.

922
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:21,860
Anyway, there are several holes in the wing,
that's where our fuel is stored.

923
01:14:22,394 --> 01:14:26,297
Which means that we can't quite make
the California coast.

924
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,398
Can't we go back to Honolulu?

925
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:33,870
We'd already past the point
of no return when it happened.

926
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:36,909
We will probably have to ditch
this plane in the sea.

927
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:39,705
We'll all be killed.

928
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:45,376
There's just a chance that you'll only be
in the water a few minutes.

929
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:48,511
There's a rescue plane already on its way
to intercept us.

930
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:52,318
Before we actually have to go in
there'll probably be several more.

931
01:14:52,424 --> 01:14:54,393
Some of which can land on water.

932
01:14:54,693 --> 01:14:57,993
And surface vessels
will be directed toward us.

933
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:04,133
Airplanes have gone into the water before...

934
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:08,036
and no one received the slightest injury,
except maybe a little dampening.

935
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:10,867
Casualties come from panic.

936
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:13,306
So you must not hurry.

937
01:15:13,412 --> 01:15:17,577
Miss Spalding and our second officer,
Mr. Wheeler, will be back here with you.

938
01:15:17,683 --> 01:15:19,845
Do exactly as they tell you.

939
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:23,912
Airplanes have been known to float
for so long that...

940
01:15:24,023 --> 01:15:28,222
they became a menace to navigation
and had to be sunk by gunfire.

941
01:15:28,327 --> 01:15:31,263
They've been known to sink
in a few minutes, too.

942
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,204
This is an inflatable life raft.

943
01:15:47,312 --> 01:15:51,079
It's really a wonderful gadget.
It's got everything in it but T-bone steaks.

944
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:53,386
It will hold all of you very comfortably.

945
01:15:53,485 --> 01:15:56,216
Mr. Wheeler, our second officer,
will be in charge.

946
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:58,847
He will tell you when to take off your shoes.

947
01:15:58,957 --> 01:16:01,188
We don't want anybody kicking holes
in this raft.

948
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:04,457
Miss Spalding will show you
where the emergency rations are...

949
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:05,690
when you get hungry.

950
01:16:05,798 --> 01:16:09,132
How're we gonna get hungry if we're only
gonna be in the raft a few minutes?

951
01:16:09,234 --> 01:16:11,066
Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?

952
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,197
Maybe a little,
but we just don't want bad things said...

953
01:16:14,306 --> 01:16:16,969
about the service and cuisine on this airline.

954
01:16:17,076 --> 01:16:18,772
No doubt there'll be caviar.

955
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:21,642
It would be most arduous
if there were no caviar.

956
01:16:21,814 --> 01:16:23,976
I'll speak to the emergency chef.

957
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:26,177
I don't think this is anything to joke about.

958
01:16:26,285 --> 01:16:28,720
You're wrong. The more jokes, the better.

959
01:16:28,854 --> 01:16:31,983
When you get in that raft,
you might even try singing.

960
01:16:32,257 --> 01:16:34,453
I was once a fair-to-middling bass.

961
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,894
I can't carry a tune in a basket,
but I'm sure loud.

962
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:40,766
Now, this is very important.

963
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:43,731
When we actually go in,
there will be two shocks.

964
01:16:44,036 --> 01:16:47,029
If you know about them in advance,
they won't frighten you.

965
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:50,507
The first will be hardly noticeable,
like a normal landing.

966
01:16:50,676 --> 01:16:53,805
But the second may be quite severe,
so brace yourselves.

967
01:16:54,246 --> 01:16:56,181
Soon after that, the lights will go out...

968
01:16:56,281 --> 01:16:59,479
but Miss Spalding and Mr. Wheeler
both have flashlights.

969
01:16:59,785 --> 01:17:03,085
So unfasten your seat belts
and wait for his call.

970
01:17:03,288 --> 01:17:04,813
And keep calm.

971
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,691
Now, is there anything
you don't understand?

972
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:09,853
Could we send a radio message
to our families?

973
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:13,023
They were gonna meet us at the airport.
They will be standing.

974
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:15,533
I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy...

975
01:17:15,634 --> 01:17:18,502
giving our position
and contacting the rescue plane.

976
01:17:18,604 --> 01:17:22,166
I've some important papers in my briefcase,
many years of work.

977
01:17:22,274 --> 01:17:23,936
Can I take them with me?

978
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:26,476
Not unless you can stuff them
in your pockets.

979
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:28,547
No baggage of any kind.

980
01:17:29,047 --> 01:17:30,675
Come to think about it...

981
01:17:30,782 --> 01:17:33,547
the bottom of the sea
is the best place for them.

982
01:17:34,987 --> 01:17:38,651
And one thing more.
Now, don't get your hopes up.

983
01:17:39,158 --> 01:17:42,651
There is one chance in a thousand
that we can make the coast.

984
01:17:42,828 --> 01:17:45,992
This isn't possible unless there is
a marked change in the wind.

985
01:17:46,098 --> 01:17:49,068
And according to our forecast,
it just couldn't happen.

986
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:53,367
But it could. And the one thing
we can do right now to help matters...

987
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:57,102
is to lighten ship.
That way we'll use slightly less fuel.

988
01:17:58,076 --> 01:18:02,207
If any of you gentlemen have ever had
an urge to throw things out of windows...

989
01:18:02,381 --> 01:18:04,646
this is your chance of a lifetime.

990
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,684
What about us girls? I love to throw things.

991
01:18:07,786 --> 01:18:10,017
Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.

992
01:18:12,558 --> 01:18:16,495
I'd better stick with the wife.
She's awfully worried about our children.

993
01:18:16,895 --> 01:18:18,488
Please, let me help.

994
01:18:18,864 --> 01:18:21,857
I'll sue the airline for this,
I'm not supposed to exert myself.

995
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:25,563
- The doctor says my heart--
- Your heart is breaking my heart.

996
01:18:26,004 --> 01:18:29,532
We can get rid of some of this baggage
if you gentlemen will come with me...

997
01:18:29,641 --> 01:18:33,134
and the rest of you
form a line clear back to the door.

998
01:19:33,972 --> 01:19:36,305
My new Mainbocher frock is in here.

999
01:19:36,408 --> 01:19:38,934
The insurance company isn't gonna like this.

1000
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:54,822
What a wonderful excuse
to get a new wardrobe.

1001
01:21:10,469 --> 01:21:14,065
Be kind of nice if he came through all this...

1002
01:21:14,773 --> 01:21:16,537
and didn't know a thing about it.

1003
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:19,740
I need a big man.

1004
01:21:21,513 --> 01:21:22,537
Interested?

1005
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:25,879
- Fascinated.
- Grab me around the waist.

1006
01:21:43,535 --> 01:21:46,300
I'll start kicking things out, but be careful.

1007
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:50,865
Keep behind me, it's lonesome out there.

1008
01:22:59,377 --> 01:23:00,868
That does it.

1009
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:08,752
Now all we have to do is wait.

1010
01:23:12,257 --> 01:23:13,589
Excuse me.

1011
01:23:25,604 --> 01:23:29,166
My kids, they like to hear me play this.

1012
01:24:10,248 --> 01:24:13,480
- Aren't you coming back to our seat?
- I'm staying here.

1013
01:24:13,585 --> 01:24:15,884
I can't stand that crying towel.

1014
01:25:21,152 --> 01:25:24,589
Hobie, give me 2,250 rpm.

1015
01:25:28,226 --> 01:25:31,094
Crack the cowl flaps.
Watch those head temperatures.

1016
01:25:36,534 --> 01:25:38,435
Give me another inch of boost!

1017
01:25:38,737 --> 01:25:41,730
Look at the fuel, Skipper,
the flow meters, we're pouring it in.

1018
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,175
I can't help it. This turbulence is slowing us
down and we can't climb out of it!

1019
01:25:58,556 --> 01:26:00,149
Have a cup of coffee.

1020
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:04,160
- I'm plenty hot enough now.
- Then it will cool you off.

1021
01:26:13,571 --> 01:26:16,234
Of course you're worried, Mrs. Joseph.

1022
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:19,311
But I'm quite certain
we'll get out of this all right.

1023
01:26:19,411 --> 01:26:23,143
By tomorrow we can look back on it
as an interesting experience.

1024
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:27,051
By the by, how old are your children?

1025
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:31,056
Jennifer is six and Edward is four.

1026
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:35,559
Jennifer is such a delightful name,
Mrs. Joseph. How fortunate you are.

1027
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:41,165
Jennifer has always brought to me
the suggestion of the Scottish moor...

1028
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:44,932
heather, great peace...

1029
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:48,566
and visions of little villages
nestled against the hills.

1030
01:26:49,207 --> 01:26:50,937
That sort of thing.

1031
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:53,571
Is your Jennifer anything like that?

1032
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:58,310
I don't know exactly what you mean,
but she's always been a quiet child.

1033
01:26:58,416 --> 01:26:59,577
Precisely.

1034
01:26:59,851 --> 01:27:02,912
Somehow I knew your Jennifer
would be like that.

1035
01:27:03,088 --> 01:27:07,025
And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing
so fast you can't buy shoes for him.

1036
01:27:07,959 --> 01:27:09,621
Every three weeks.

1037
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:14,361
Why don't you try to rest now?

1038
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:18,067
Later I'd like to hear
a great deal more about your children.

1039
01:27:28,146 --> 01:27:30,547
I thought you hated
the mere mention of children.

1040
01:27:30,648 --> 01:27:31,980
I do.

1041
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:35,645
But that poor woman is terrified.
I think I helped her.

1042
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,480
For 10 years you've said that
love was a word in the dictionary...

1043
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:42,686
and children were monsters.

1044
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:46,231
And you would never go two inches
out of your way to help anybody.

1045
01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:48,527
What goes, Gustave?

1046
01:27:52,237 --> 01:27:54,103
I've never seen you this way.

1047
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,765
You've forgotten yourself for a whole hour.

1048
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,868
You've been magnificent.

1049
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:03,245
Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence.

1050
01:28:04,382 --> 01:28:07,409
You told that woman
we'd get out of this all right.

1051
01:28:07,519 --> 01:28:09,488
- Do you really believe that?
- No.

1052
01:28:09,888 --> 01:28:14,189
In spite of what that pilot said,
I think we're batting at a very sticky wicket.

1053
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,528
- And yet you're not afraid?
- Yes and no.

1054
01:28:18,196 --> 01:28:20,028
I'm not sure just how I feel.

1055
01:28:20,732 --> 01:28:24,362
If I were openly afraid now,
some of the others might become so.

1056
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:28,870
I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics
right after the fire...

1057
01:28:28,973 --> 01:28:31,204
and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.

1058
01:28:32,477 --> 01:28:34,503
I just want to know one thing.

1059
01:28:34,779 --> 01:28:37,442
What happened to the biggest baby
in the world?

1060
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:40,910
The child-man who was afraid to sleep
with the lights off.

1061
01:28:41,019 --> 01:28:44,387
You used to burst into tears
if the laundry put starch in your shirts...

1062
01:28:44,489 --> 01:28:46,651
or the crepe suzette was underdone.

1063
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:51,830
I don't understand you, Gustave.
I guess I never will.

1064
01:28:53,231 --> 01:28:55,826
Maybe it isn't important to understand you...

1065
01:28:57,435 --> 01:29:01,099
like the other women
you've always managed to keep around.

1066
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:07,812
I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain
with a throwback, a Roman emperor.

1067
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:13,484
You bought me on the market, Gustave,
paid for me...

1068
01:29:13,585 --> 01:29:17,249
like you might pay for a play
which you thought might turn out well.

1069
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:24,393
For 10 years I've lived with that thought
and hated it.

1070
01:29:26,631 --> 01:29:28,725
Now it'll never bother me again.

1071
01:29:36,407 --> 01:29:38,842
Gustave, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

1072
01:29:38,943 --> 01:29:43,745
And if we don't get out of this,
I'd like you to know it even more.

1073
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:47,650
I've never said it before...

1074
01:29:48,386 --> 01:29:51,151
and probably you'll never want me
to say it again.

1075
01:29:51,256 --> 01:29:54,055
What else is on your twisted little mind?

1076
01:29:58,596 --> 01:30:00,462
I'm in love with you, Gustave.

1077
01:30:03,701 --> 01:30:06,034
I guess I always have been.

1078
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,113
And then you tie the ribbons like this.

1079
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:21,386
These preservers are not inflated now.

1080
01:30:21,753 --> 01:30:24,279
If you jerk this cord on either side...

1081
01:30:24,389 --> 01:30:26,824
carbon dioxide will be released
from the capsules...

1082
01:30:26,925 --> 01:30:28,860
and the vest will inflate immediately.

1083
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,223
That's all there is to it.

1084
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:35,093
- Any calls for me?
- Take your pick.

1085
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:38,065
Boyd, public relations.

1086
01:30:38,503 --> 01:30:41,371
No, Tommy. We've not lost an airplane.

1087
01:30:41,506 --> 01:30:45,170
I'm standing right here in Operations
and our plane is still in the air.

1088
01:30:45,276 --> 01:30:48,940
Yeah, we had a little trouble.
No, I don't know the passengers' names.

1089
01:30:49,047 --> 01:30:51,016
Yeah, okay.

1090
01:30:51,115 --> 01:30:54,381
Where's Garfield? This jerk newspaper
wants a statement from the manager.

1091
01:30:54,485 --> 01:30:56,920
He's on his way. He'll be here any minute.

1092
01:30:57,021 --> 01:30:58,922
Boyd, public relations.

1093
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:02,852
Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown
over 30 million passenger miles...

1094
01:31:02,961 --> 01:31:05,021
without ever scratching a passenger.

1095
01:31:05,129 --> 01:31:06,893
Sure we want to cooperate.

1096
01:31:06,998 --> 01:31:10,127
You'll get the straight dope,
just give me time to get organized.

1097
01:31:10,234 --> 01:31:11,930
Goodbye.

1098
01:31:12,036 --> 01:31:13,834
Mr. Garfield, can you give me a minute?

1099
01:31:13,938 --> 01:31:15,770
Just about. What's your trouble?

1100
01:31:15,873 --> 01:31:18,604
The papers are on my neck already.
What will I tell them?

1101
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:20,702
How about "drop dead" for an opener?

1102
01:31:20,812 --> 01:31:23,577
- You know I can't do that.
- I know.

1103
01:31:23,681 --> 01:31:26,412
- How long can you stall them?
- I don't know, maybe an hour.

1104
01:31:26,517 --> 01:31:28,418
They're crying about morning editions.

1105
01:31:28,519 --> 01:31:31,318
An hour might be enough.
We've got real trouble.

1106
01:31:32,056 --> 01:31:33,991
Does it look that bad?

1107
01:31:34,926 --> 01:31:36,690
It don't look good.

1108
01:31:44,335 --> 01:31:46,065
Is everything all right with you two?

1109
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:49,766
I don't know when I've felt better
in the last five years.

1110
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:54,870
I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl
I would most like to be on a life raft with.

1111
01:31:55,213 --> 01:31:58,479
Of course, now,
she may prefer a younger man.

1112
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:03,182
There is in my family a very old saying.

1113
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:13,960
I will try to translate it for you.

1114
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,469
"The youth of man will never die...

1115
01:32:20,138 --> 01:32:22,266
"unless he murders it."

1116
01:32:23,374 --> 01:32:25,206
I plead not guilty.

1117
01:32:26,377 --> 01:32:29,176
I just want to show you
how to use your life vest.

1118
01:32:30,681 --> 01:32:32,616
My neck won't stand any weight...

1119
01:32:32,717 --> 01:32:35,881
and my bones are only held together
by my imagination.

1120
01:32:35,987 --> 01:32:38,821
A burial at sea will save my heirs
a lot of money.

1121
01:32:39,357 --> 01:32:42,919
- I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.
- Why do that?

1122
01:32:43,094 --> 01:32:46,030
You just look more comfortable
that way, Mr. Briscoe.

1123
01:32:46,564 --> 01:32:50,057
You impress me
as the open-collar type anyway.

1124
01:32:50,568 --> 01:32:51,831
Rugged, you know.

1125
01:32:51,936 --> 01:32:53,666
- Outdoorsy, you mean?
- Yes.

1126
01:32:54,338 --> 01:32:58,867
You behave yourself. I'll be coming back
to make sure you're being nice to Miss Chen.

1127
01:32:58,976 --> 01:33:02,606
It's a rough assignment for an outdoor man
without his horse...

1128
01:33:02,713 --> 01:33:04,841
but I'll do my best.

1129
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:08,250
Would you like to put your vests on now?

1130
01:33:09,287 --> 01:33:13,554
Investigation will undoubtedly prove
this airplane was ready for the junk heap.

1131
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:15,960
And we're in the hands of incompetents.

1132
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:20,191
I don't want to make no trouble,
but why don't you shut up?

1133
01:33:20,298 --> 01:33:21,698
You hate me, don't you?

1134
01:33:21,799 --> 01:33:24,428
All of you hate me
because I tried to do what was right.

1135
01:33:24,535 --> 01:33:26,766
Do like the little lady says.

1136
01:33:26,871 --> 01:33:28,965
Don't touch me, please.

1137
01:33:29,073 --> 01:33:32,566
You're giving me a very bad time,
Mr. Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.

1138
01:33:32,677 --> 01:33:33,872
I have a perfect right--

1139
01:33:33,978 --> 01:33:37,107
You got no rights at all
for some time to come.

1140
01:33:37,548 --> 01:33:42,179
Do like she says or no life vest
is gonna keep you from drowning...

1141
01:33:42,286 --> 01:33:46,189
because I'm gonna hold your head under
till you stop wiggling.

1142
01:33:49,594 --> 01:33:53,031
If we should happen to go down,
I'll give you plenty of warning.

1143
01:33:53,131 --> 01:33:56,295
Cross your arms like this
right in front of your face.

1144
01:33:56,501 --> 01:33:59,198
Brace your hands on the seat just ahead.

1145
01:33:59,570 --> 01:34:01,971
Bend your head down between your arms...

1146
01:34:02,073 --> 01:34:04,975
and keep them there
until we've stopped completely.

1147
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,240
Remember to remove your shoes.

1148
01:34:07,345 --> 01:34:10,440
- You men should loosen your collar and tie.
- Why?

1149
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:13,118
According to the ditching instructions...

1150
01:34:13,217 --> 01:34:15,914
there is less possibility
of breaking your neck.

1151
01:34:27,498 --> 01:34:29,057
Anything from 420?

1152
01:34:29,634 --> 01:34:31,500
Not a sound out of them, sir.

1153
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:35,665
Those people, if they have to ditch tonight...

1154
01:34:35,773 --> 01:34:38,140
with the way that wind's
kicking up that sea...

1155
01:34:38,876 --> 01:34:41,175
they don't stand much of a chance,
I'm thinking.

1156
01:35:54,685 --> 01:35:56,620
Cristobal Trader <i>from San Francisco.</i>

1157
01:35:56,721 --> 01:36:00,158
<i>We can work the aircraft clearly now.</i>
<i>Thanks for your help. Over.</i>

1158
01:36:00,258 --> 01:36:01,590
Good. <i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1159
01:36:02,593 --> 01:36:06,325
<i>Cristobal Trader</i> over and out.

1160
01:36:37,128 --> 01:36:40,292
How about letting me take over for a while?
Save yourself for later.

1161
01:36:40,398 --> 01:36:42,196
- We'll need you.
- All right.

1162
01:36:50,408 --> 01:36:53,310
Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.

1163
01:36:53,411 --> 01:36:57,371
Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left.
But if the winds are right we can make it.

1164
01:36:57,715 --> 01:37:00,810
We picked up four minutes in the past hour.
I figured it all out.

1165
01:37:00,918 --> 01:37:03,888
If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes,
we're safe.

1166
01:37:03,988 --> 01:37:06,514
Hey, Skipper, the interceptor is calling us.

1167
01:37:09,093 --> 01:37:12,825
We estimate our position
at 145 miles east of you.

1168
01:37:13,097 --> 01:37:16,261
Expect interception
in approximately 20 minutes.

1169
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,891
Get a bearing on him.

1170
01:37:21,672 --> 01:37:24,437
We will transmit every three minutes
from now on.

1171
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:28,206
When your needle begins
to fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.

1172
01:37:28,546 --> 01:37:30,708
We will then be very close to you.

1173
01:37:31,582 --> 01:37:33,608
You should have a bearing by now.
How about it?

1174
01:37:40,524 --> 01:37:41,992
We're gonna make it.

1175
01:37:44,362 --> 01:37:48,094
Five degrees north of our course.
We're awful glad to know you're around.

1176
01:37:49,433 --> 01:37:52,699
We know what you mean.
Say, can you guys climb any higher?

1177
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,371
Out of this stuff
interception would be a lot easier.

1178
01:37:55,473 --> 01:37:58,807
Negative. We can climb,
but we don't want to use the fuel to do it.

1179
01:37:58,909 --> 01:38:00,935
Every gallon's a mile nearer shore for us.

1180
01:38:02,113 --> 01:38:03,911
Okay. We'll find you anyway.

1181
01:38:27,638 --> 01:38:30,733
- Are you still afraid?
- No, my darling.

1182
01:38:32,977 --> 01:38:37,142
I don't mean the airplane.
I mean us, our future.

1183
01:38:38,182 --> 01:38:40,151
I'm not afraid of anything now.

1184
01:38:41,385 --> 01:38:42,785
I can't hear you.

1185
01:38:44,455 --> 01:38:47,857
How could I ever be afraid
when you hold me like this?

1186
01:38:48,893 --> 01:38:51,920
- I love you.
- Darling.

1187
01:39:05,876 --> 01:39:06,844
No.

1188
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:11,972
Just think where we are.

1189
01:39:12,082 --> 01:39:14,551
I'm thinking how awful it would be...

1190
01:39:14,652 --> 01:39:17,520
if this was the last time I could hold you so.

1191
01:39:18,556 --> 01:39:22,994
- We'll have years, all our lives.
- If this airplane makes it.

1192
01:39:24,562 --> 01:39:27,191
Careful, darling.

1193
01:39:35,973 --> 01:39:37,100
Howard.

1194
01:39:47,718 --> 01:39:50,187
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

1195
01:39:52,022 --> 01:39:54,321
Would you be sorry if I drowned?

1196
01:39:55,326 --> 01:39:57,886
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I have to know.

1197
01:40:00,831 --> 01:40:02,697
I'd be more than sorry.

1198
01:40:04,034 --> 01:40:06,594
You could go off to your North woods.

1199
01:40:09,373 --> 01:40:12,434
It's occurred to me
that trying to make a go at that mine...

1200
01:40:12,543 --> 01:40:14,910
might turn out to be a bad dream.

1201
01:40:15,513 --> 01:40:18,278
But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.

1202
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,877
It was.

1203
01:40:23,254 --> 01:40:26,952
I could switch things back.
I suppose that would please you.

1204
01:40:27,057 --> 01:40:28,889
I'd only lose you.

1205
01:40:31,061 --> 01:40:34,293
A few hours ago,
you insisted on getting rid of me.

1206
01:40:38,969 --> 01:40:42,770
At times I'm a very stupid
and selfish woman.

1207
01:40:45,609 --> 01:40:48,204
I think you should go up to your mine.

1208
01:40:48,779 --> 01:40:50,111
That's you.

1209
01:40:51,849 --> 01:40:54,512
And you might take me along for laughs.

1210
01:40:55,419 --> 01:40:57,115
I'm hearing things.

1211
01:40:58,355 --> 01:41:00,051
You'd be miserable.

1212
01:41:00,524 --> 01:41:01,753
No doubt.

1213
01:41:03,093 --> 01:41:04,584
But I want you.

1214
01:41:05,362 --> 01:41:07,854
The guy I had sense enough to marry.

1215
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:14,630
If I choke on hotcakes,
or try to put evening gowns on the natives...

1216
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:20,671
or have cocktails with the sled dogs,
you'll just have to be patient with me.

1217
01:41:22,413 --> 01:41:25,110
You don't have to, but I wish you would.

1218
01:41:27,818 --> 01:41:31,516
Mush! That's what you say
to a sled dog, isn't it?

1219
01:41:32,189 --> 01:41:34,249
I want to start practicing.

1220
01:41:38,028 --> 01:41:41,157
Makes them turn left,
if you yell it loud enough.

1221
01:41:43,968 --> 01:41:46,062
You're very good.

1222
01:41:50,507 --> 01:41:53,671
- Can you get that through to Sullivan?
- I can try.

1223
01:41:53,877 --> 01:41:56,540
- Everything else buttoned up?
- Yes, sir.

1224
01:41:59,383 --> 01:42:02,820
- Any improvement in the local weather?
- I'm afraid not.

1225
01:42:20,604 --> 01:42:23,335
- Radar, anything yet?
- No target, sir.

1226
01:42:24,174 --> 01:42:27,201
Navigator, how's our position
for interception?

1227
01:42:27,444 --> 01:42:29,640
Dead on. Just got a loran fix.

1228
01:42:30,681 --> 01:42:33,776
We should be joining now,
if their navigator is anywhere near right.

1229
01:42:45,429 --> 01:42:47,591
- Radar?
- No target, sir.

1230
01:42:47,898 --> 01:42:50,834
- Somebody's wrong.
- We should be right on top of them.

1231
01:42:54,405 --> 01:42:55,634
We can easily miss this guy.

1232
01:42:57,841 --> 01:42:59,332
No target, sir.

1233
01:43:01,912 --> 01:43:05,781
That navigator's wacky.
We're already seven minutes overdue.

1234
01:43:07,251 --> 01:43:08,378
Radar?

1235
01:43:09,386 --> 01:43:13,153
Target, Skipper. Strong blip.
Four degrees left, eight miles.

1236
01:43:13,557 --> 01:43:15,048
Looks like he's 500 feet below us.

1237
01:43:32,042 --> 01:43:33,635
<i>Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?</i>

1238
01:43:34,678 --> 01:43:38,012
What happened to the 11 minutes
you were counting on?

1239
01:43:38,248 --> 01:43:40,410
What happened to them, fatso?

1240
01:43:40,818 --> 01:43:43,378
You never could make them up,
you just thought you could.

1241
01:43:44,722 --> 01:43:48,591
- Lennie, what about it?
- Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.

1242
01:43:59,903 --> 01:44:02,395
Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.

1243
01:44:03,307 --> 01:44:06,675
Find the minutes,
and you can come back to me.

1244
01:44:07,444 --> 01:44:09,242
Minutes.

1245
01:44:09,947 --> 01:44:11,813
Who's got the minutes?

1246
01:44:11,915 --> 01:44:14,510
Your Susie's got them, right here.

1247
01:44:17,254 --> 01:44:19,280
Come on, Lennie. What's holding things up?

1248
01:44:19,389 --> 01:44:21,949
The Coast Guard says your position's wrong.

1249
01:44:22,059 --> 01:44:24,358
I'll be right with you, Skipper.

1250
01:44:33,237 --> 01:44:34,205
Skipper?

1251
01:44:37,808 --> 01:44:39,299
I got bad news.

1252
01:44:40,811 --> 01:44:44,213
The Coast Guard was right.
I made a dumb kid's mistake.

1253
01:44:45,082 --> 01:44:48,484
We're not as close to the coast
as I thought we were.

1254
01:44:48,619 --> 01:44:51,384
I was figuring in knots instead of miles.

1255
01:44:52,189 --> 01:44:54,249
I guess I was just scared.

1256
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:56,188
What about those 11 minutes?

1257
01:44:56,293 --> 01:44:59,354
They can make the difference
between the water and your own bed.

1258
01:44:59,463 --> 01:45:01,091
They aren't there.

1259
01:45:02,099 --> 01:45:03,931
They never were there.

1260
01:45:05,068 --> 01:45:06,764
I'm sorry, Skipper.

1261
01:45:19,983 --> 01:45:21,849
I hope this will float.

1262
01:45:46,076 --> 01:45:48,875
<i>I am so excited about your arrival, Sally.</i>

1263
01:45:49,213 --> 01:45:53,116
<i>Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains</i>
<i>and pines, which will be your home, too...</i>

1264
01:45:53,217 --> 01:45:56,881
<i>and go down to the city</i>
<i>for my first visit in over a year.</i>

1265
01:45:57,287 --> 01:45:59,813
<i>I want to get there</i>
<i>a few days before you arrive...</i>

1266
01:45:59,923 --> 01:46:02,324
<i>because there are some things</i>
<i>this cabin needs...</i>

1267
01:46:02,426 --> 01:46:05,089
<i>to make it more comfortable for a girl.</i>

1268
01:46:07,598 --> 01:46:10,625
<i>I'm still scared you won't like it up here...</i>

1269
01:46:19,877 --> 01:46:23,245
<i>unless you're nuts about</i>
<i>the sound of a mountain stream...</i>

1270
01:46:23,347 --> 01:46:27,648
<i>or love to watch the sun seem to turn</i>
<i>a mountain peak around very slow.</i>

1271
01:46:32,589 --> 01:46:33,818
Hey, Henry.

1272
01:46:39,096 --> 01:46:41,531
<i>One of our neighbors</i>
<i>just came by to say hello.</i>

1273
01:46:41,632 --> 01:46:43,692
<i>A little fawn I call Henry.</i>

1274
01:46:43,834 --> 01:46:47,236
<i>He seems to ask,</i>
<i>"Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"</i>

1275
01:46:47,337 --> 01:46:48,828
<i>So hurry, girl!</i>

1276
01:46:51,475 --> 01:46:53,910
<i>So you'll be sure to recognize me</i>
<i>at the airport...</i>

1277
01:46:54,011 --> 01:46:56,446
<i>I'll be wearing a bright green tie.</i>

1278
01:46:57,514 --> 01:47:00,006
<i>P.S. I was just thinking how lucky I am.</i>

1279
01:47:00,117 --> 01:47:02,552
<i>I happened to pick up</i>
<i>an old torn magazine...</i>

1280
01:47:02,653 --> 01:47:06,146
<i>and there is your picture,</i>
<i>smacking me right between the eyes.</i>

1281
01:47:06,256 --> 01:47:10,057
<i>And only a short time later,</i>
<i>that very wonderful-looking little girl...</i>

1282
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,220
<i>is coming to share my life.</i>

1283
01:47:36,653 --> 01:47:37,985
Remarkable.

1284
01:47:39,623 --> 01:47:41,387
What's so remarkable?

1285
01:47:41,959 --> 01:47:44,861
Is it faith or just habit
that compels a woman...

1286
01:47:44,962 --> 01:47:48,194
to put on fresh makeup
before boarding a life raft?

1287
01:47:48,665 --> 01:47:50,725
Aren't you jumping the gun?

1288
01:47:51,268 --> 01:47:54,432
You're being a fatalist
about this business then?

1289
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:59,842
I'm not sure I even know what a fatalist is.

1290
01:48:00,377 --> 01:48:05,179
How can you sit there so calmly then,
when a little while ago you were terrified?

1291
01:48:05,882 --> 01:48:10,252
I sat down here with you because
I thought I might be able to help you.

1292
01:48:10,587 --> 01:48:12,283
But I'm not needed.

1293
01:48:14,257 --> 01:48:16,226
If you came over to give me help...

1294
01:48:16,326 --> 01:48:19,455
it was partly because
you needed help yourself...

1295
01:48:21,098 --> 01:48:22,430
very badly.

1296
01:48:25,335 --> 01:48:27,031
Don't worry about me.

1297
01:48:27,137 --> 01:48:29,629
I've just stopped worrying
about losing something...

1298
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:32,471
I never had a chance to get
in the first place.

1299
01:48:32,576 --> 01:48:36,069
Would the thing be a man?
Or am I getting too personal?

1300
01:48:36,913 --> 01:48:38,108
You are.

1301
01:48:38,415 --> 01:48:40,179
I don't care anymore.

1302
01:48:41,284 --> 01:48:43,844
I've been kidding myself long enough.

1303
01:48:45,622 --> 01:48:47,887
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

1304
01:48:49,226 --> 01:48:51,195
What are you hiding from?

1305
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:54,991
Myself.

1306
01:48:57,601 --> 01:49:00,833
He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.

1307
01:49:02,139 --> 01:49:05,303
He has a right to know
what kind of a person I am.

1308
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:08,545
I'm going to tell him...

1309
01:49:08,645 --> 01:49:12,138
that I'm a different kind of person
than he thinks I am.

1310
01:49:15,685 --> 01:49:17,415
I'm not wonderful...

1311
01:49:18,288 --> 01:49:22,020
not kind, I'm not clean.

1312
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:29,697
Telling you these things is easy,
because you're a stranger...

1313
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,962
and I'll never see you again.

1314
01:49:34,204 --> 01:49:35,797
Telling him is....

1315
01:49:37,174 --> 01:49:40,838
It's going to be one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life...

1316
01:49:42,579 --> 01:49:44,343
'cause in my heart...

1317
01:49:46,483 --> 01:49:48,315
I'll always see him...

1318
01:49:49,953 --> 01:49:53,185
even when he turns his back
and walks away.

1319
01:50:00,897 --> 01:50:02,456
Look at my face.

1320
01:50:04,267 --> 01:50:06,133
Wouldn't you walk away?

1321
01:50:08,705 --> 01:50:11,470
I'm so much older
than my years have made me.

1322
01:50:13,176 --> 01:50:15,839
Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.

1323
01:50:16,413 --> 01:50:18,575
You'll see how very old I am.

1324
01:50:21,651 --> 01:50:22,880
I'm beat.

1325
01:50:24,888 --> 01:50:27,187
I'll make a swell-looking bride.

1326
01:50:28,692 --> 01:50:30,126
A beat bride.

1327
01:50:33,597 --> 01:50:35,691
But I'm not afraid anymore.

1328
01:50:38,735 --> 01:50:42,263
Now that I know what's going to happen,
I'm almost happy.

1329
01:50:46,576 --> 01:50:49,637
So, I wasn't making up my face
a few minutes ago.

1330
01:50:52,015 --> 01:50:54,484
I was looking in the mirror, at me.

1331
01:50:57,554 --> 01:51:00,217
Does that answer your question, mister?

1332
01:51:02,926 --> 01:51:04,417
I was mistaken.

1333
01:51:05,695 --> 01:51:09,359
You aren't a fatalist.
You're a very courageous young lady.

1334
01:51:11,701 --> 01:51:15,468
Maybe some of it will brush off on me
if I keep sitting here.

1335
01:51:16,506 --> 01:51:19,670
Maybe I can throw a few things
out of my own life.

1336
01:51:41,398 --> 01:51:44,459
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't use them things.

1337
01:51:51,841 --> 01:51:54,037
- Do you have to do that?
- Yeah.

1338
01:52:00,183 --> 01:52:02,584
Could I have my property back now?

1339
01:52:02,686 --> 01:52:05,986
- Why?
- It would mean a great deal to me.

1340
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:10,222
Take away this feeling
of being constantly watched.

1341
01:52:11,628 --> 01:52:14,757
I'm all right, now. Quite calm.
You can trust me.

1342
01:52:26,142 --> 01:52:27,371
Sit down.

1343
01:52:28,945 --> 01:52:33,883
You got lots to think about,
and maybe not so much time for to do it.

1344
01:52:55,272 --> 01:52:58,868
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

1345
01:52:58,975 --> 01:53:02,503
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1346
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,581
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

1347
01:53:05,682 --> 01:53:08,117
hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come....

1348
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:15,149
Sparks, get on the horn.

1349
01:53:15,258 --> 01:53:17,625
Advised interception completed at 56.

1350
01:53:24,567 --> 01:53:26,559
Okay, Dan. I'll take over.

1351
01:53:41,951 --> 01:53:45,319
Go back now. Take the Gibson girl,
get the passengers all set.

1352
01:53:45,422 --> 01:53:47,448
You'll have plenty of time.

1353
01:53:47,557 --> 01:53:52,018
Turn on the seat belt sign
10 minutes before we start for the water.

1354
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,272
Good luck, you guys.

1355
01:54:08,345 --> 01:54:11,179
- Anything new with the wind, Lennie?
- No.

1356
01:54:11,514 --> 01:54:13,483
We're not very fat, then?

1357
01:54:13,583 --> 01:54:18,487
- If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.
- Eleven minutes? Is that all you need?

1358
01:54:19,022 --> 01:54:22,083
- Are you sure?
- I know exactly where we are now.

1359
01:54:22,459 --> 01:54:24,758
Eleven minutes more of fuel
would see us through.

1360
01:54:24,861 --> 01:54:29,322
What increase in wind velocity
would we need to arrange that little thing?

1361
01:54:29,432 --> 01:54:31,424
Twenty knots in the next hour.

1362
01:54:31,534 --> 01:54:33,799
- That's asking a lot.
- Yeah.

1363
01:54:34,604 --> 01:54:36,800
It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.

1364
01:54:36,906 --> 01:54:39,569
But if the wind swung around
a little more in the tail...

1365
01:54:39,676 --> 01:54:41,042
it could be.

1366
01:54:45,415 --> 01:54:48,283
I guess they'll pick us up
before we get too damp.

1367
01:54:48,385 --> 01:54:50,354
Susie will sure be worried.

1368
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:54,057
She'll lay down the law.
Probably insist I quit flying.

1369
01:54:56,025 --> 01:54:57,254
Will you?

1370
01:55:00,697 --> 01:55:01,665
No.

1371
01:55:09,539 --> 01:55:12,771
- Everything's here. I just hope it works.
- It will.

1372
01:55:15,044 --> 01:55:17,536
Wouldn't you rather
not have to depend on it?

1373
01:55:17,647 --> 01:55:20,515
- What do you mean?
- Suppose we didn't ditch.

1374
01:55:20,617 --> 01:55:21,949
You've got to.

1375
01:55:22,619 --> 01:55:26,556
Lennie says all we need
is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.

1376
01:55:27,524 --> 01:55:30,289
Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.

1377
01:55:32,162 --> 01:55:35,929
Would you think I was wrong
if I tried to talk him out of it?

1378
01:55:36,499 --> 01:55:38,468
Maybe try a little luck?

1379
01:55:39,769 --> 01:55:40,828
Luck?

1380
01:55:41,070 --> 01:55:43,130
That's has-been thinking.

1381
01:55:43,306 --> 01:55:45,901
Wanna run out of fuel,
right over San Francisco?

1382
01:55:46,009 --> 01:55:48,808
Wipe out a few bridges
or apartment houses?

1383
01:55:48,912 --> 01:55:53,111
Sullivan's been over this ocean lots of times.
He knows his business.

1384
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:56,219
I've seen men act like this before.

1385
01:55:57,187 --> 01:56:00,180
Sometimes because of one thing
or another...

1386
01:56:01,391 --> 01:56:03,986
fella stops thinking straight temporarily.

1387
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:12,965
I've been flying a long time, Hobie.

1388
01:56:16,406 --> 01:56:18,238
Only, you're not the captain.

1389
01:56:18,341 --> 01:56:20,037
Maybe because your so-called luck...

1390
01:56:20,143 --> 01:56:22,977
ran out on you once down in South America.

1391
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:25,271
This is no luck operation.

1392
01:56:28,585 --> 01:56:31,555
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1393
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:36,986
Maybe.

1394
01:57:36,986 --> 01:57:40,582
Here it is, Lennie.
Color may not become you...

1395
01:57:41,524 --> 01:57:44,961
- but it'll suffice you.
- Thanks, for nothing.

1396
01:57:48,598 --> 01:57:52,365
About that 11 minutes,
are you absolutely sure?

1397
01:57:52,902 --> 01:57:54,234
Absolutely.

1398
01:58:02,612 --> 01:58:06,208
Lennie says if we can pick up 11 minutes,
we can make it.

1399
01:58:12,722 --> 01:58:14,350
He could be right.

1400
01:58:19,128 --> 01:58:22,656
It'll be rough down there.
If we hit wrong, we've had it.

1401
01:58:25,435 --> 01:58:30,135
Maybe we ought to ease off a little on
the power and save a few drops of fuel.

1402
01:58:32,442 --> 01:58:34,502
Any objections if I try it?

1403
01:58:39,916 --> 01:58:42,181
This won't work. She's going to stall on me.

1404
01:58:42,285 --> 01:58:44,413
That's no good. We'll blow another engine.

1405
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:47,649
What's the difference?
We'll blow them all if we ditch.

1406
01:58:48,124 --> 01:58:50,923
Put those controls back where they belong.

1407
01:58:51,494 --> 01:58:54,191
- Put those props back.
- Nothing doing, Skipper.

1408
01:58:54,297 --> 01:58:55,856
That's an order!

1409
01:58:57,166 --> 01:59:00,568
Hang on, chum. You can do it.
Now fly and let me pray.

1410
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:02,798
We'll run out of gas,
right over San Francisco.

1411
01:59:02,905 --> 01:59:07,206
Let's try out this way for a while.
Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!

1412
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:10,109
- She's starting to shake again.
- Let her shake!

1413
01:59:10,213 --> 01:59:13,615
Let her mush down a few feet
if you have to. We're saving fuel this way.

1414
01:59:13,716 --> 01:59:15,207
Hang on and fly!

1415
01:59:22,792 --> 01:59:26,888
- Did you call Sullivan's wife?
- Yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport.

1416
01:59:26,996 --> 01:59:28,521
- You didn't alarm her?
- No.

1417
01:59:28,631 --> 01:59:32,261
I just told her, her husband was on his way,
and that you wanted to see her.

1418
01:59:32,368 --> 01:59:34,200
Then she knows something's happened.

1419
01:59:34,303 --> 01:59:37,034
Probably. But her voice was quite calm.

1420
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:39,470
How about the others?

1421
01:59:39,575 --> 01:59:43,376
Wheeler lives with another pilot, Dupree.
There was no answer.

1422
01:59:43,913 --> 01:59:45,609
The same for Wilby.

1423
01:59:45,915 --> 01:59:49,784
I called his home
and then a bar I know about.

1424
01:59:50,453 --> 01:59:53,821
His wife had been there,
but she left about an hour ago...

1425
01:59:53,923 --> 01:59:55,050
drunk.

1426
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:00,692
- The stewardess?
- No, Spalding's mother isn't well.

1427
02:00:00,797 --> 02:00:03,460
Her father is out of town on business.

1428
02:00:04,534 --> 02:00:09,302
I wish I could tell them all together.
I think maybe they could help each other.

1429
02:00:09,405 --> 02:00:12,239
There isn't anybody listed on there
for Dan Roman.

1430
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:15,607
- Do you know any person close to him?
- Yeah.

1431
02:00:16,446 --> 02:00:19,883
But I don't think you could reach her.
Dan lives alone.

1432
02:00:49,112 --> 02:00:52,082
- Is everything all right?
- Just great, junior.

1433
02:00:54,884 --> 02:00:56,944
This is a stunning garment.

1434
02:00:57,487 --> 02:01:00,082
I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.

1435
02:01:01,491 --> 02:01:04,359
It's a frowsy looking shroud, if you ask me.

1436
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:10,291
Baby.

1437
02:01:13,803 --> 02:01:17,797
I went through the first World War
and the Blitz in London.

1438
02:01:20,209 --> 02:01:22,508
I was scared, but not like this.

1439
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:31,151
I want to show you something cute.
Want to see something cute?

1440
02:01:32,755 --> 02:01:34,587
I must be slipping.

1441
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:39,060
No reaction, even from a man like you,
who should appreciate such things.

1442
02:01:42,532 --> 02:01:46,299
Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.

1443
02:01:48,371 --> 02:01:49,862
I'm frightened.

1444
02:01:49,972 --> 02:01:53,136
Talking. Honey, you don't know
what you're asking.

1445
02:01:53,709 --> 02:01:55,974
I'll tell you a good joke on me.

1446
02:01:56,078 --> 02:01:59,412
You know, I always dreaded
the idea of becoming an old woman...

1447
02:01:59,515 --> 02:02:03,919
and from the way things look now,
I won't have to worry about it anymore.

1448
02:02:05,888 --> 02:02:08,119
You know, I haven't been whistled at
in years.

1449
02:02:08,224 --> 02:02:10,056
And the idea of growing roses...

1450
02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:13,288
for the rest of my life
was really beginning to haunt me.

1451
02:02:15,598 --> 02:02:18,898
There ought to be a home
for dames like me.

1452
02:02:19,001 --> 02:02:20,833
We should have organized.

1453
02:02:21,804 --> 02:02:24,968
You know, a house somewhere
with no mirror in it.

1454
02:02:26,142 --> 02:02:29,579
Far away, where we'd never have to look
at a young girl.

1455
02:02:30,379 --> 02:02:32,974
They have homes for unmarried mothers.

1456
02:02:33,449 --> 02:02:36,351
But everybody forgets about the girls who...

1457
02:02:37,053 --> 02:02:40,751
never quite managed to make things legal.

1458
02:02:42,825 --> 02:02:44,817
I think I could start one.

1459
02:02:46,162 --> 02:02:50,862
I can call it the "May Holst Home
for Broken-down Broads."

1460
02:02:53,269 --> 02:02:55,534
I kind of like that, don't you?

1461
02:03:07,416 --> 02:03:10,079
Well, they're as ready now as they'll ever be.

1462
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:14,779
- Can you take something else in your stride?
- I can try.

1463
02:03:14,891 --> 02:03:15,915
Good.

1464
02:03:16,025 --> 02:03:18,017
I want you to do me a favor.

1465
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:24,158
Look, when I tell you, sit down there
with your back against that seat...

1466
02:03:24,267 --> 02:03:26,463
stay there, no matter what else is going on.

1467
02:03:26,569 --> 02:03:29,437
Don't try to be a heroine
because in those last few moments...

1468
02:03:29,538 --> 02:03:33,066
there isn't anything in the world
you can do to help anybody.

1469
02:03:33,175 --> 02:03:35,644
You know, your face
can improve any landscape.

1470
02:03:35,745 --> 02:03:37,407
I want you to keep it that way.

1471
02:03:37,513 --> 02:03:39,175
So the favor for me is this pillow.

1472
02:03:39,282 --> 02:03:42,548
Hold it tightly over your face,
for yourself and for me.

1473
02:03:42,685 --> 02:03:45,086
With the wind and the sea
neither God nor Sullivan...

1474
02:03:45,187 --> 02:03:47,383
can set this thing down tonight
like an egg crate.

1475
02:03:47,490 --> 02:03:51,552
We might just as well slam into a mountain.
Dan knows it. I know it.

1476
02:03:51,661 --> 02:03:52,993
And so does Sullivan.

1477
02:03:59,435 --> 02:04:02,200
Wilby, check your final position.
I'm going to take her down.

1478
02:04:02,305 --> 02:04:03,898
- Wait a few more minutes.
- Do as I say.

1479
02:04:04,006 --> 02:04:05,440
- But it looks like--
- Do as I say.

1480
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:09,342
- Give him a few more minutes.
- I've already waited too long. Here we go.

1481
02:04:09,445 --> 02:04:13,439
No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself,
you yellow....

1482
02:04:21,524 --> 02:04:23,516
420 is losing altitude, sir.

1483
02:04:23,626 --> 02:04:25,390
420, from Coast Guard.

1484
02:04:25,695 --> 02:04:28,961
Radar reports you're descending.
Are you going to ditch?

1485
02:04:31,734 --> 02:04:35,171
You are now below the minimum legal
altitude for approaching the coast.

1486
02:04:35,271 --> 02:04:38,241
Time's wasting.
You better climb or settle for the drink.

1487
02:04:38,341 --> 02:04:41,573
We're right with you. We'll follow you down.
Advise immediately.

1488
02:04:42,645 --> 02:04:46,309
420 to Coast Guard.

1489
02:04:47,216 --> 02:04:49,913
We've been too busy to answer. Stand by.

1490
02:04:50,486 --> 02:04:52,682
We may have a change in plans.

1491
02:05:03,532 --> 02:05:06,297
<i>Thirty minutes of fuel left.</i>
<i>Cross-feed problem.</i>

1492
02:05:07,203 --> 02:05:09,172
<i>Throw the rule book away.</i>

1493
02:05:09,405 --> 02:05:12,500
<i>Highest obstruction, 1,950 feet...</i>

1494
02:05:12,608 --> 02:05:15,077
<i>so 2,200 will be safe.</i>

1495
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:21,139
<i>Leonard, stand by electric altimeter,</i>
<i>call out readings.</i>

1496
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:23,651
<i>Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.</i>

1497
02:05:23,786 --> 02:05:26,483
<i>More efficient use of fuel against time.</i>

1498
02:05:26,922 --> 02:05:28,618
<i>Study approach book.</i>

1499
02:05:29,225 --> 02:05:31,626
<i>Air Traffic Control to clear area.</i>

1500
02:05:31,794 --> 02:05:34,263
<i>Direction finders on range station.</i>

1501
02:05:35,331 --> 02:05:36,890
<i>Start right now.</i>

1502
02:05:39,802 --> 02:05:40,826
Dan?

1503
02:05:41,704 --> 02:05:42,763
Yeah?

1504
02:05:43,706 --> 02:05:44,867
Thanks.

1505
02:05:45,875 --> 02:05:48,743
Thanks for knocking some sense
into my head.

1506
02:05:49,412 --> 02:05:52,177
- Someday I'll explain.
- You don't have to.

1507
02:05:53,649 --> 02:05:57,586
We're not going to ditch.
We'll make San Francisco the hard way.

1508
02:05:58,687 --> 02:06:02,180
- Any change in the wind, Lennie?
- We picked up three of those 11 minutes.

1509
02:06:02,291 --> 02:06:05,261
Bring me the approach chart
for San Francisco.

1510
02:06:09,365 --> 02:06:11,334
Whistle me a tune, Dan.

1511
02:06:12,535 --> 02:06:14,527
I like music while I work.

1512
02:06:28,084 --> 02:06:31,748
- Can I get you something, Mr. Briscoe?
- Yes. A ham sandwich.

1513
02:06:31,921 --> 02:06:35,688
I can't. Everything went overboard.
Now you put on that vest.

1514
02:06:35,991 --> 02:06:40,725
Great service. You throw all the food
to the sharks, so you won't have to serve it.

1515
02:06:41,130 --> 02:06:43,190
Tell you what. Proposition.

1516
02:06:43,699 --> 02:06:48,501
I think Miss Chen will let me buy her a steak
in San Francisco, if you come along, too.

1517
02:06:49,171 --> 02:06:51,834
If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.

1518
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:55,001
Mr. Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.

1519
02:07:03,219 --> 02:07:05,654
- Take a breather, Dan.
- Okay.

1520
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,192
The Farallon Islands, any minute now.

1521
02:07:16,198 --> 02:07:18,497
- Don't go any lower.
- No. I'll hold this altitude.

1522
02:07:18,601 --> 02:07:21,400
Get back and call out our altitude
on the radio altimeter.

1523
02:07:21,504 --> 02:07:24,497
We'll make straight for the northwest leg
of San Francisco range.

1524
02:07:24,607 --> 02:07:27,372
The area's been cleared
and we're practically on the ground.

1525
02:07:27,476 --> 02:07:29,638
I like the way you said that.

1526
02:07:40,623 --> 02:07:43,616
Twenty-eight miles to go.
He's made first base.

1527
02:07:43,726 --> 02:07:46,594
But if that guy runs out of fuel
between here and the airport...

1528
02:07:46,695 --> 02:07:48,664
I don't know where he'll put
that thing down...

1529
02:07:48,764 --> 02:07:50,357
except in the middle of Market Street.

1530
02:08:03,512 --> 02:08:05,242
Shut that thing off.

1531
02:08:10,886 --> 02:08:11,945
Well?

1532
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:18,650
I'm going over to the terminal.
If needed, I'll be in the control tower.

1533
02:08:58,801 --> 02:09:00,667
This is it. Ten minutes.

1534
02:09:01,503 --> 02:09:03,472
Come on, let's make a final check.

1535
02:09:09,645 --> 02:09:10,635
Inflate your vest, please.

1536
02:09:10,746 --> 02:09:12,977
- We're going down?
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

1537
02:09:13,082 --> 02:09:16,052
Take your time coming back to the door.
Wait until I yell.

1538
02:09:16,151 --> 02:09:19,679
- Coast Guard plane still with us?
- Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.

1539
02:09:19,788 --> 02:09:21,416
Put out your cigarette, please.

1540
02:09:21,523 --> 02:09:24,755
Inflate your vest, Mr. Childs.
You too, Miss Holst.

1541
02:09:26,462 --> 02:09:29,899
- Some brassiere.
- Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.

1542
02:09:30,566 --> 02:09:32,228
I really ought to take my briefcase.

1543
02:09:32,334 --> 02:09:34,929
Sorry, nothing doing.
Inflate your vest, please.

1544
02:09:39,975 --> 02:09:41,170
I can't.

1545
02:09:41,644 --> 02:09:43,112
I'm terrified.

1546
02:09:44,113 --> 02:09:45,877
I can't seem to move.

1547
02:09:51,287 --> 02:09:53,153
Don't worry. Good luck.

1548
02:09:56,659 --> 02:09:59,026
- All set, you two?
- We're still hungry.

1549
02:09:59,128 --> 02:10:02,155
Our steak date is postponed.
Inflate your vest, please.

1550
02:10:07,469 --> 02:10:09,062
Maybe you should keep this.

1551
02:10:09,171 --> 02:10:12,335
I'd loved thinking it was mine,
even if it was just for a few hours.

1552
02:10:12,441 --> 02:10:14,808
Nonsense. You can keep it as dry as I can.

1553
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:17,141
If it's still working tomorrow night at 7:00...

1554
02:10:17,246 --> 02:10:20,478
take a cab to Ernie's restaurant
on Montgomery street.

1555
02:10:20,683 --> 02:10:23,243
If it isn't working, come anyway.

1556
02:10:23,686 --> 02:10:24,847
Thanks.

1557
02:10:25,487 --> 02:10:27,854
We got them all to blow up, see?

1558
02:10:28,057 --> 02:10:31,391
Good work. Remember take your time
coming back to the door.

1559
02:10:31,694 --> 02:10:32,923
You want?

1560
02:10:33,095 --> 02:10:35,291
No, thanks. Thanks just the same.

1561
02:10:35,397 --> 02:10:39,164
If anything happens to me,
get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.

1562
02:10:39,268 --> 02:10:42,602
- Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken.
- You tell her yourself, mister.

1563
02:10:42,705 --> 02:10:46,540
You'll be all right. I'm not worrying
and I'll be the last guy off this airplane.

1564
02:10:46,642 --> 02:10:49,339
- Do you have to be?
- That's what I get paid for.

1565
02:10:50,979 --> 02:10:53,141
- Seat belt tight?
- I think so.

1566
02:10:54,483 --> 02:10:56,042
This is for real, isn't it?

1567
02:10:56,151 --> 02:10:58,916
I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.

1568
02:11:04,059 --> 02:11:06,187
Well, even I might float.

1569
02:11:09,298 --> 02:11:11,290
Inflate your vest, please.

1570
02:11:24,279 --> 02:11:27,408
I don't want to die.

1571
02:11:27,516 --> 02:11:30,884
Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.

1572
02:11:32,488 --> 02:11:35,981
Give her two of these when you can.
They'll quiet her.

1573
02:12:06,288 --> 02:12:09,554
Stand by for anything. Sullivan is gonna try
and make San Francisco.

1574
02:12:09,658 --> 02:12:10,956
- Can we?
- I don't see how.

1575
02:12:11,059 --> 02:12:13,824
Technically, we're out of fuel right now.

1576
02:12:16,832 --> 02:12:18,391
We've bought it.

1577
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:35,414
550 feet, Skipper.
The coast hills must be coming up.

1578
02:12:35,517 --> 02:12:37,486
- Watch it!
- 400, a little less.

1579
02:12:37,586 --> 02:12:38,781
Hang on!

1580
02:12:41,623 --> 02:12:42,818
330.

1581
02:12:43,258 --> 02:12:44,282
250.

1582
02:12:44,726 --> 02:12:45,955
Ground's coming up fast!

1583
02:12:50,199 --> 02:12:51,963
200, Skipper. This ain't good.

1584
02:12:55,037 --> 02:12:56,061
180.

1585
02:13:03,812 --> 02:13:05,678
420, from Coast Guard.

1586
02:13:05,981 --> 02:13:08,473
Twin Peaks coming up on your left
in a minute or so.

1587
02:13:08,584 --> 02:13:11,179
Remember those radio towers.
Stay on course.

1588
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,386
Don't descend anymore.

1589
02:13:13,755 --> 02:13:15,849
Thanks. We're trying not to.

1590
02:13:16,825 --> 02:13:18,623
150 feet, Skipper!

1591
02:14:57,292 --> 02:14:59,818
300 feet, Skipper. We must be past the hills.

1592
02:15:07,035 --> 02:15:08,059
400.

1593
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:13,568
500. We're living!

1594
02:15:22,918 --> 02:15:27,049
420, this is San Francisco Towers.
Special weather.

1595
02:15:27,456 --> 02:15:31,894
Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.
Wind, west northwest.

1596
02:15:32,260 --> 02:15:34,388
Twenty to 25. Over.

1597
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:39,133
Okay, San Francisco Tower.
We'll make an ILS approach.

1598
02:15:39,635 --> 02:15:42,195
Turn the runway lights up full blast.

1599
02:16:36,958 --> 02:16:39,689
- Cone of silence.
- Right with you, chum.

1600
02:16:39,795 --> 02:16:43,061
- We're cleared straight on down.
- This is going to be a fast one.

1601
02:16:43,165 --> 02:16:45,498
Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.

1602
02:16:49,838 --> 02:16:52,034
Get the outer marker, Dan.

1603
02:16:52,741 --> 02:16:56,007
Outer marker identified.
But we're way below our glide path...

1604
02:16:56,111 --> 02:16:57,374
so watch it, chum.

1605
02:16:57,479 --> 02:17:00,210
There's a 690-foot radio tower
around here someplace.

1606
02:17:00,315 --> 02:17:03,285
Has to be behind us,
we're right on the approach leg.

1607
02:17:03,819 --> 02:17:06,220
Let me know it when they're clear.

1608
02:17:30,212 --> 02:17:32,681
Feather it, Dan! Quick!
No time to fool with it.

1609
02:17:35,851 --> 02:17:38,343
Give me full power on the other two.

1610
02:17:40,956 --> 02:17:43,016
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

1611
02:18:08,216 --> 02:18:09,809
- Contact yet?
- No.

1612
02:18:13,455 --> 02:18:16,892
- This is a sweater.
- You're doing fine.

1613
02:18:18,059 --> 02:18:21,188
When we pass the inner marker,
I'm shoving her down regardless.

1614
02:18:21,296 --> 02:18:22,355
Yeah.

1615
02:18:27,335 --> 02:18:29,770
Approach lights dead ahead. Maybe a mile.

1616
02:18:29,871 --> 02:18:31,499
Give her the gear.

1617
02:18:32,607 --> 02:18:34,235
Three green lights and pressure.

1618
02:18:39,714 --> 02:18:42,741
We can only stay in the air
another 30 seconds.

1619
02:18:43,285 --> 02:18:46,119
- Full flaps.
- Full flaps.

1620
02:18:58,433 --> 02:19:01,130
Now I lay me down to sleep.

1621
02:20:00,161 --> 02:20:02,721
Did you get hurt? Was anyone hurt at all?

1622
02:20:15,377 --> 02:20:16,709
Two more coming down now.

1623
02:20:16,811 --> 02:20:20,509
There's Mr. Pardee, the famous producer.
He'll give us some information.

1624
02:20:23,652 --> 02:20:26,588
- You're Gustave Pardee, aren't you?
- I was. I'm not so sure now.

1625
02:20:26,688 --> 02:20:30,489
- Please leave us alone. We're very tired.
- Give us a few words about your flight.

1626
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:32,527
I couldn't tell you. Not in a million words.

1627
02:20:32,627 --> 02:20:36,223
- What will your next production be?
- It will take a little longer than usual.

1628
02:20:36,331 --> 02:20:37,993
- Next year, I hope.
- Next year?

1629
02:20:38,099 --> 02:20:39,499
Now, please let us pass.

1630
02:20:50,378 --> 02:20:51,505
Sally!

1631
02:20:54,282 --> 02:20:55,648
Who are you?

1632
02:21:12,834 --> 02:21:14,234
Miss, just one statement.

1633
02:21:14,970 --> 02:21:17,633
- Tell us who you are.
- What's your name?

1634
02:21:21,943 --> 02:21:23,809
- Why, it's a boy!
- Little boy.

1635
02:21:23,912 --> 02:21:27,144
He'll sure have a story to tell his grandkids.

1636
02:21:36,992 --> 02:21:40,861
- Daddy wants you to come and see him.
- I will, darling. I will!

1637
02:21:42,497 --> 02:21:45,934
Look at my space material.

1638
02:21:51,606 --> 02:21:54,269
- Here he is. Who's that?
- Give us a statement.

1639
02:21:56,745 --> 02:21:59,681
Where's the nearest telephone?
I have to call Honolulu, my wife.

1640
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:01,044
- Over there.
- Thanks.

1641
02:22:01,149 --> 02:22:02,640
No questions, please.

1642
02:22:02,751 --> 02:22:04,219
What happened?

1643
02:22:04,419 --> 02:22:06,615
Here she is.

1644
02:22:07,655 --> 02:22:09,954
Hold it right there. Thank you.

1645
02:22:10,091 --> 02:22:11,855
She must be in show business.

1646
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:13,986
She's in show business, all right.

1647
02:22:17,999 --> 02:22:19,865
She's the star of the Follies!

1648
02:22:21,736 --> 02:22:23,170
Tell us your story.

1649
02:22:24,406 --> 02:22:25,874
Just one.

1650
02:22:36,651 --> 02:22:39,314
Papa!

1651
02:22:42,857 --> 02:22:44,553
Just a moment.

1652
02:22:46,628 --> 02:22:50,395
Listen, boys. I'm just a fisherman.
I want to see my kids.

1653
02:23:04,145 --> 02:23:07,673
Thirty gallons, Mr. Garfield.
That's all there was left in all the tanks.

1654
02:23:07,782 --> 02:23:09,944
Too little to really measure.

1655
02:23:14,222 --> 02:23:18,159
Tell this man we must have reservations
on the plane, first thing tomorrow morning.

1656
02:23:18,259 --> 02:23:21,320
We'll miss Elvira's party.
It's important to you.

1657
02:23:21,429 --> 02:23:23,728
What's Elvira's party
got to do with sled dogs?

1658
02:23:23,832 --> 02:23:25,824
Really, darling. Don't be tiresome.

1659
02:23:25,934 --> 02:23:29,928
We might as well play safe until you find out
how things are going to turn out.

1660
02:23:30,038 --> 02:23:31,631
All right, Lydia.

1661
02:24:13,948 --> 02:24:15,314
Hello, Pete.

1662
02:24:15,817 --> 02:24:18,912
Meet us out front.
We're going for our steaks.

1663
02:24:21,789 --> 02:24:25,191
Ten minutes, Mr. Briscoe,
I'll be there for sure.

1664
02:25:13,675 --> 02:25:15,507
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Garfield.

1665
02:25:18,947 --> 02:25:21,849
- I think your wife's waiting for you.
- Yeah.

1666
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:26,448
I don't want to keep her standing too long.
We're expecting.

1667
02:25:26,854 --> 02:25:29,915
When you get rested, call me.
We'll have a talk.

1668
02:25:30,425 --> 02:25:32,587
Yeah, sure.

1669
02:25:37,599 --> 02:25:38,931
Good night.

1670
02:25:40,101 --> 02:25:41,433
Good night.

1671
02:25:44,939 --> 02:25:46,908
Good night, Mr. Garfield.

1672
02:25:52,614 --> 02:25:54,981
- Souvenir?
- For my wife.

1673
02:25:55,850 --> 02:25:58,752
I guess the rain won't hurt it,
better get it home though.

1674
02:25:58,853 --> 02:26:01,254
Susie will be waiting. Good night.

1675
02:26:13,835 --> 02:26:17,431
Well, I guess I better get going.
Little past my bedtime.

1676
02:26:17,805 --> 02:26:19,740
You had 30 gallons left.

1677
02:26:21,776 --> 02:26:22,835
Yeah.

1678
02:26:24,312 --> 02:26:26,804
Good night. We'll get together soon.

1679
02:26:28,116 --> 02:26:29,448
Sure, chum.

1680
02:26:42,263 --> 02:26:43,231
So long.

1681
02:26:45,633 --> 02:26:48,569
So long, you ancient pelican.
