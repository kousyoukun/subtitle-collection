1
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,634
Hey, fella.

2
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,318
Ain't you Dan Roman?

3
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,275
Yeah.

4
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,756
I heard you whistling
and I said to myself,

5
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,791
only one guy does that just so.

6
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,155
I'd know that
ugly face of yours anywhere.

7
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,838
But you don't remember me, I bet you.

8
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,598
Sure I do. Ben Sneed.

9
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,432
I thought you'd be milking cows
somewheres on your own...

10
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,270
I mean, I thought you'd quit flying.

11
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,954
I thought you'd stay away
from these things.

12
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,949
They're only a hunk of metal.
They don't go no place in particular.

13
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
I guess I just haven't got
much willpower, Ben.

14
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,633
- What are you up to?
- Crew chiefing with Far East.

15
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,234
It's a good job.

16
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,515
I gotta go, Dan.

17
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,792
- I just thought I'd say hello.
- Sure. Good luck.

18
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,755
- Either one of you know that man?
- Sure looks old for a copilot.

19
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,270
- Didn't know we were so hard up.
- He weren't always a copilot.

20
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,830
We used to call him "Whistling Dan. "

21
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,310
One of the finest men you'd ever know.

22
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,389
And the most miserable. He was
down in Colombia same time I was.

23
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,274
He's taking off one night
with a full load

24
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,356
and one of them South American
line squalls

25
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,550
decided to hit the field at the same time.

26
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,070
The wind shifts too late for him to stop
and he don't quite make it over

27
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,713
a little hill at the end of the field.

28
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,796
I remember that one.
Right after the war, right?

29
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,310
Yeah. Dan hits flap,
but the ship breaks in half

30
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,635
and there's nothing but fire
in 10 seconds.

31
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,716
Dan gets tossed
through the cockpit window

32
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,798
and only gets a few scratches
plus that game leg of his.

33
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,988
Which leaves him alive to blame
himself. Everybody else gets killed.

34
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,875
Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,956
It don't work out quite that way.

36
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,915
I knew two of the passengers.
They were off to the coast for a holiday.

37
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,108
Blonde girl, name of Mary
and a little boy, name of Tony.

38
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,670
Everybody thought
they were wonderful people,

39
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,199
including Dan Roman.

40
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,759
Mary was Dan's wife
and little Tony was his only kid.

41
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,909
Yup.

42
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,918
Dan is the only guy I ever knew who
had guts enough not to commit suicide.

43
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,111
<i>Flight 21 now arriving,

45

Nice to have you with us, Mr Flaherty.
Please check with immigration now.

You'll board in about 30 minutes.

47
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,070
This is Miss Spalding, your stewardess.

48
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,113
- I'll be in the bar.
- We'll call you, Mr Flaherty.

49
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,469
Trouble.

50
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,435
- Mr and Mrs Joseph?
- Yes, sirree.

51
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,075
The Waikiki kids. Just put us down
as a float for the Rose Bowl parade.

52
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,714
- Your age, Mr Joseph?
- Today?

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,877
No, I'm 38, so help me.

54
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,192
- Birthplace?
- Passaic, New Jersey.

55
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,914
That's the Garden State.
Motto. Liberty and prosperity.

56
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,270
Bounded on the north by New York,
on the south by...

57
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,439
- And Mrs Joseph?
- Shall I tell him? I'm 33,

58
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,956
and I was born in Ogden, Utah.

59
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,228
Thank you, immensely.

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,435
Aloha.

61
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,877
- Hey, look. Remember?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,355
My name is Sally McKee.
I'm 30 years old.

63
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,236
I was born in Riverside, California.

64
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,711
- You're still a United States citizen?
- Yes, of course.

65
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,117
Thank you, Miss McKee.
Please check with immigration.

66
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,551
Your flight will be announced.

67
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,755
She may be put together
with paste and flour,

68
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,713
but that woman has something.
What would you say it was?

69
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
Practise. Plenty of practise.

70
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,958
- Aren't you...
- Yes, I'm Gustave Pardee.

71
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,752
I've enjoyed your New York shows
very much.

72
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,949
Good. Delighted.

73
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,274
Here are our tickets.

74
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,119
I'm 47 and I was born in New York City.

75
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,714
Mrs Pardee?

76
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,515
I'm 30,
and I was born in Owosso, Michigan.

77
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,998
- How will the weather be?
- Fine, Mr Pardee.

78
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,076
You should have a very pleasant trip.

79
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,718
He looks like a tired walrus on a rock.

80
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,435
She looks like she's done all right
for a slender redhead from Owosso.

81
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,030
- Ken Childs, 53. Born in Philadelphia.
- Yes, Mr Childs.

82
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,197
I don't know where my luggage is. The
Royal was supposed to send it down.

83
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,673
We'll check right into it, sir.

84
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,075
May I introduce your stewardess,
Miss Spalding.

85
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,758
Hello, sister. New here, aren't you?

86
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,791
Four months now with the company,
Mr Childs.

87
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,310
Good. I don't know where they get
some of the girls

88
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,432
but things are improving.

89
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,752
One of the few men who has ever made
any real money out of aviation.

90
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,599
He's one of our stockholders.
Treat him accordingly.

91
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,834
If you please.

92
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,398
- Dorothy Chen?
- Yes.

93
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,474
- Born in Antung, Manchuria?
- Yes, but I am Korean.

94
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,195
You have your passport handy,
of course.

95
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,879
Please take it to immigration.
It's just over there.

96
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,356
It's a real pleasure
to have you with us, Miss Chen.

97
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,674

98
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,479
- That face.
- A moon and a willow tree.

buying a present for my wife.

102
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,075
Susie will sure be excited
when she sees this.

103
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,389
Yeah.

104
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,875
I already been up to Weather.
The winds aren't too bad.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,149
Let's try 9,000 for a change.

106
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,271
I'll have a flight plan

3,050 gallons be all right

109
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,348
Sounds all right,
let's see what Leonard says.

110
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,716
It looks about 12 hours and 16 minutes,

111
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,432

Say, Skipper, how old would you say
Dan Roman is?

116
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,833
He was flying planes before I was born.
Look at it yourself.

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,988
He flew the airmail
in the open-cockpit days.

118
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,714
I think he learned to fly
in the first World War.

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,032
And endurance flights, racing,
old-time barnstorming.

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,470
Ten or 15 years with Transworld.

121
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,590
In the second World War, he flew
a bomber in the Ploiesti oilfield raid.

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,795
He took his cracks at Germany
in B-17 s,

123
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,272
finally wound up with a B-29 squad
into Okinawa.

124
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,358
I'll just lay you a bet
he's got better than 20,000 hours.

125
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,790
- It sure is embarrassing.
- What's embarrassing?

126
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,396
He's got so much time and all.

127
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,831
They must've been out of their heads
to hire an old fire-horse like him.

128
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,076
Why not let him graze in the pasture?

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,800
- All ready, Lennie?
- All set to sign, Skipper.

133
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,988
Me, too.

134
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,714
Twenty-one souls onboard.
The rest, cargo.

135
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,837
73,000 pounds gross.

136
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,355
I said it to Orville, I said it to Wilbur,
and I say it to you,

137

the thing will never leave the ground.

You may rely on Miss Spalding to take
good care of your son, Mr Fields.

He's not the first young man

140
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,916
It will be quite an adventure for him.

141
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,759
He's, unfortunately,
quite an experienced traveller.

142
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,472
His mother will meet him
in San Francisco.

143
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,194
She's brunette, and quite beautiful.

144
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,833
If you'll wait at Gate 4, Mr Fields,
you may put Tobey aboard yourself.

154
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,469
You'll make it with time to spare,
Mr Rice.

155
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,716
We'll make it with time to spare.

156
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,429
That little lady had a grandfather
who left her both brains and riches.

157
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,358
She bought her husband
an advertising agency not long ago

158
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,993
because he wanted a new toy.

159
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,473
How do you know these things?

160
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,875
I used to be a night clerk
in a Nevada hotel.

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,594
<i>Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.</i>

162
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,190
- Mr Locota?
- Yeah, that's me.

163
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,634
I'm a fisherman.

164
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,558
My family should be in fishermen
for a couple of hundred years,

165
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,272
maybe more, I don't know.

166
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,635
The fish, they don't school up here,

167
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,591
like on the coast of California.

168
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,995
So, I'm gonna go back
to San Francisco now.

169
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,155
Thank you, Mr Locota.

170
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,271
Your plane will be announced
in a few minutes.

171
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,755
Don't you want us
to check that through for you?

172
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,475
But I got in here my things
for to eat for the trip.

173
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,160
You've hurt my feelings, Mr Locota.

174
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,351
Did you think you wouldn't eat my lunch,

175
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,152
or the steak we're gonna have
for dinner?

176
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,556
Ma'am, miss,
I don't know about these things.

177
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,799
I never fly before. I don't want to make
no trouble for nobody.

178
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,150
Serving you will be a pleasure,
Mr Locota.

179
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,599
Thank you.

180
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,390
Just a minute, Mr Locota.
There you are.

181
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,518
Thank you. Excuse me very much.

182
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,517
You didn't know all about that little man.

183
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,518
The ticketing sheet had nothing on him
except statistics.

184
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,790
I'm afraid he falls into
the "nobody" category.

185
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,310
He's gonna be more
than a statistic to me. I like him.

186
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh, brother.
Will I be glad to get on that plane.

187
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,798
Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?

188
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,356
Listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.
But this place,

189
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,871
Coney Island with coconuts.

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,470
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take all the Hawaiian Islands...

191
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,916
Tobey, will you tell your mother
something for me?

192
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,830
Tell your mother that there shouldn't be
an ocean between us.

193
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,028
Tell her I wish
she'd come with you next time.

194
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,479
- Can you remember all that, Tobey?
- Yes, Daddy.

195
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,672
I got him, Daddy. I got him.

196
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,672
- Everything okay, Dan?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

197
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,476
3,050 aboard.

198
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,956
There's a slight oil leak, Number 4.
Nothing to worry about.

199
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,593
How long does it look like?

200
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,439
Lennie says 12 hours
and 15 minutes, about.

201
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,949
Twelve hours and 16 minutes exactly.

202
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,118
<i>Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.</i>

203
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,434
San Francisco.
I must go to San Francisco.

204
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,438
Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.
You're not on the list.

205
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,676
Mr Kenneth Childs is on your plane,
isn't he?

206
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,028
Why, yes. Mr Childs...

207
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,038
Then you must have room.
I insist. I must go.

208
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,353
Very well, sir. Fortunately
we have space available today

209
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,358
- if you're an American citizen.
- I am. I am for sure.

210
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,517
My name is Humphrey Agnew.
I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.

211
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,790
Right here in Honolulu.
Perhaps you've heard?

212
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,309
Yes. Do you have a travel card,
Mr Agnew?

213
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,919
I pay cash for everything.

214
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,952
If you'll just step across the lobby
and check with immigration,

215
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,913
then come right back here,
we'll have your ticket ready, sir.

216
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,832
Now, there goes a real quack.

217
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,428
He's made a fortune
selling Agnew's aids to better living.

218
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,629
What have you got?

219
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,911
Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness,
sticky liver?

220
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,315
Agnew has got a curing pill
for all of them.

221
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,796
- So long, Alsop. Have fun.
- I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.

222
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,311
May I take your coat, Mrs Pardee?

223
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,909
- You all right, Mr Locota?
- Yes.

224
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,319
- We going to fly very high?
-7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir,

225
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,589
depends on our clearance.

226
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,188
Wouldn't you like to sit
next to the window, Mr Briscoe?

227
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,835
You know something, miss? This is
as far as the old carcass would go.

228
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,269
I'd rather look at you
than what's outside, anyhow.

229
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,914
Your seat belt isn't fastened.
Shame on you.

230
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,880
My arm just won't bend around
the way it should.

231
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,672
- Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.
- I don't see any holes.

232
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,350
You know something, miss?
Neither do I.

233
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,194
Would you like me to take your leis,
put them in a cool place?

234
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,355
They'll keep better.

235
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,517
Now, that's just about the smartest idea
anybody ever had.

236
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,351
Gotta keep them as long as we can.

237
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,148
Gotta get back
to the old salt mines tomorrow.

238
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,277
Get the nose to the grindstone.

239
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,869
That's Hawaiian for "thank you. "

240
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,271
Let me tell you something.
If we get into any trouble,

241
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,108
any serious trouble
that the pilot can't handle,

242
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,674
you just come to old Ed Joseph.

243
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,758
I'll be glad to go up there and help him
if he needs me.

244
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,279
- Got it?
- Got it.

245
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,518
All right, young man,
it's time to get you buckled down now.

246
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,836
Just make you nice and comfy here.

247
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,153
And the next thing you know
we'll be in the air, all right?

248
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,069
- Mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?
- I would be so pleased.

249
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,594
I am so happy
you wish to sit next to me,

250
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,476
because I have been watching you
walk down the aisle

251
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,355
and have the desire
to say a thing to you.

252
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,916
It is that you are
the first real, alive American girl

253
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,396
I have ever greeted in person.

254
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
You are so very beautiful.

255
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,838
I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one

256
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,510
if all the girls in America

257
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,038
are so beautiful and kind.

258
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,232
I don't think you're going to
have to worry about a thing.

259
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,629
Off.

260
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,432
- Wing flaps.
- Fifteen degrees.

261
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,152
- Mixture.
- Auto rich.

262
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,838
V1 and V2 speeds?

263
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,032
112, 116, that about does it.

264
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,116
- Check the radios, Dan?
- Yeah.

265
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,475
420 ready for takeoff.

266
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,075
Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.

267
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,476
When you have time, I wish you'd come
back and talk to one of my passengers.

268
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,635
All right.

269
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,228
He's a Mr Pardee,
big rumpled-looking man,

270
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,873
sitting halfway back on the right side.

271
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,514
Alsop said he had something to do
with the New York theatre.

272
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,358
I suppose he wants to put you
on the stage.

273
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,152
Call me
if you need your honour defended.

274
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,669
And jump from the frying pan
into the fire?

275
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,711
He's the original frightened Freddie.

276
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,594
Every time you bank or change
propeller pitch, he goes all white.

277
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,995
Grabs on his seat
like it was an electric chair.

278
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,553
Okay.

279
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,358
I thought you were
going to quit smoking.

280
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,040
I did. I haven't smoked
in three hours and 20 minutes.

281
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,832
Go ahead, stain your teeth.

282
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,675
Come see me when you grow up, junior.

283
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,555
What in the world are you
bawling about?

284
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,110
Have I done something to bring this on?

285
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,516
- Nell, cut it out.
- I'm trying to.

286
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,478
I just can't.

287
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,119
It's just, it's all over.

288
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,472
What's over?

289
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,668
Our honeymoon.

290
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,320
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

291
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,799
Of course it does. It's not over
for another 12 hours or so.

292
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,273
And it never has to be
as far as I'm concerned.

293
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,353
Oh, Milo.

294
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,989
I'm scared.

295
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,914
I'm just plain scared.

296
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,430
What are you scared of? We've got
the whole world in front of us.

297
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,155
It's just that we're so young.

298
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,071
And just like you said,

299
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,915
we've got that whole big world
down there.

300
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,751
- And you know what?
- What?

301
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,471
We've got to face it.

302
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,876
I thought you had confidence in me.

303
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,232
Of course I do.

304
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,513
It's just that

305
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,837
all the rest of the people in the world
don't know you like I do.

306
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,754
Supposing I was going to have a baby
and you didn't have a job?

307
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,438
- You're not supposed...
- Suppose I was?

308
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,595
All right.

309
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,069
You're going to have a baby
and I haven't got a job,

310
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,555
there's no food in the apartment,
it's snowing outside,

311
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,955
and the sheriff's knocking on the door...

312
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,159
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

313
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,396
- Are you?
- Am I what?

314
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,834
Are you...

315
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,029
You know.

316
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,398
- Me?
- You.

317
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,716
Oh, Milo. No.

318
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,515
Whatever gave you such an idea?

319
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,359
I don't know.

320
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,998
Prof. Flaherty. Welcome.

321
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,471
Are we to believe
you are at last resolved

322
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,160
to abandon the arts
and return to science?

323
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,470
If so, we rejoice.

324
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,430
We have sorely missed your help
and advice.

325
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,796
You're doing all right.

326
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,350
You'll find out how to blow up the world
all by your little selves.

327
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,514
It won't be long now and blooie.
Congratulations.

328
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,357
Professor, we all appreciate the fact
that you've been under enormous strain.

329
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,677
We deeply regret
that a man of your calibre

330
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,155
no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.

331
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,349
Cooperate?

332
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,114
I had a seat on a nice little campus

333
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,192
even if I wasn't making much money,

334
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,073
or my students didn't know
what I was talking about.

335
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,157
And I played pretty good golf

336
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,597
and I slept nights.

337
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,958
I was happy because I figured
it was still God's business

338
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,116
to monkey around with the universe.

339
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,871
He can fix a star
so it'll burn for a billion years.

340
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,310
Keep going and you'll find out
how to burn one up in a minute.

341
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,917
Did any of you ever bother
to look at the lagoon out there?

342
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,638
It's beautiful and blue,

343
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,078
and the people around it
are brown and kind

344
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,709
and they did know
how to laugh and sing.

345
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,559
Only now all the fishes
in the lagoon are dead.

346
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,470
And the people are scared forever.

347
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,838
They don't sing anymore.

348
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,516
You found a way to blow out a window

349
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,598
65 miles away from the impact point.

350
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,188
Only, suppose there's a mother

351
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,959
standing in that window
with a baby in her arms?

352
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,279
Professor,

353
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,432
I suggest you go to your tent
and rest for a while.

354
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,991
I'll arrange transport back to the States
for you at the earliest possible moment.

355
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,798
Yeah, do that.

356
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,149
I want to find a shepherd in the hills
or a mountain in the mist,

357
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,398
and paint their picture

358
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,033
before it's too late.

359
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,192
So, you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

360
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,109
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

361
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,555
I've made almost 200 flights
across here

362
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,478
and I feel a lot safer
than if I were driving my car.

363
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,152
I've got a lovely wife and two kids,
another on the way.

364
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,669
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was safe.

365
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,598
You hedged, Captain.
You didn't answer my question.

366
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,675
Come now,

367
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,190
be a good honest fellow
and tell me exactly what frightened you?

368
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,508
They were technical incidents. I don't
think you'd understand, Mr Pardee.

369
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,153
I understand perfectly.

370
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,715
For some reason,
you were afraid you wouldn't reach

371
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,592
your Biblical span of life.

372
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,518
Which is precisely what's bothering me
at the moment.

373
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,552
I'm convinced I couldn't swim
from here to the nearest shore.

374
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,477
You won't have to swim, Mr Pardee.

375
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,875
Suppose one of your motors
ceases to function?

376
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,390
We'd just go back to Honolulu. These
ships fly beautifully on three engines.

377
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,795
If it should happen
beyond our point of no return

378
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,672
we'd simply continue
on to San Francisco.

379
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,076
Suppose two of your motors
became uninterested in further toil?

380
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,879
Each engine is entirely independent
of the other.

381
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,754
The chances of two quitting during the
same flight are one in several million.

382
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,075
Even if that should happen,
we could still fly,

383
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,156
lower and much slower,
but we'd get there.

384
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,478
You are very reassuring.
Why is it I read about so many crashes?

385
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,591
The newspapers always exaggerate
the importance of an air accident.

386
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,188
It would be very important to me
if I were in one.

387
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,912
You won't be, Mr Pardee.

388
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,473
Just relax. Enjoy your flight.

389
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,236
Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you
for just a minute.

390
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,630
It can only be a minute,
then I'll have to go back to work.

391
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,872
I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.

392
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,560
I used to work in reservations
for Pan American.

393
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,197
That's fine. I'm glad you decided
to try a flight with us.

394
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,074
Aren't there two exits to this plane?
One up forward,

395
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,758
where you
and the rest of the crew leave?

396
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,995
Yes.

397
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,118
Could I leave the plane that way?
With you and the crew?

398
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,591
Please, it's very important to me.

399
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,350
It's not what you're thinking.
I am going to be met in San Francisco,

400
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,870
but not by the police or anybody else
who could get you into trouble.

401
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,797
It just wouldn't work.

402
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,233
Confused, Captain?

403
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,548
Why, no. That's you.

404
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,677
It was me, eight years ago.

405
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,315
A fellow in the States saw that picture.

406
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,269
He wrote me.

407
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,517
I was lonely, so I answered.

408
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,877
There were a lot of letters,

409
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,233
beautiful letters.

410
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,993
And then last month,
I agreed to marry him.

411
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,876
I never got around to telling him
the picture was eight years old.

412
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,833
I don't want to bore you
with my troubles,

413
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,276
but that dream kept me sane
for a long time.

414
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,228
I know I'm a

415
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,069
mess.

416
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,430
I'm so much older than he thinks I am.

417
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,594
But

418
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,956
if I could just see him

419
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,755
and then leave without meeting him.

420
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,718
Please understand, Captain.

421
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,389
What you're asking
is not exactly in my line.

422
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,112
Let me think it over. I'll let you know.

423
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,272
- Newspaper?
- No, thanks.

424
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,471
- How's AT&T?
- It's up a point.

425
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,557
I hope you don't mind,
I couldn't help watching you.

426
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,589
You remind me so much of a man
I once knew.

427
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,232
My name is Ken Childs
and I don't mind at all.

428
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,076
Fourteen minutes behind
on the last fix, Skipper.

429
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,235
So?

430
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,954
We should make it up.
The wind seems to be shifting around.

431
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,149
Good.

432
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,192
You know it's nice having
a guy like Dan Roman up here.

433
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,920
For a change,
I don't feel like a grandfather.

434
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,396
I was just saying to my wife
the other day,

435
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,112
I never had it so good.

436
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,436
Easy job, no strain,

437
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,799
and I'm pretty lucky in having
a girl like Susie.

438
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,670
It makes all the difference in the world
what kind of a wife a guy has.

439
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,518
Don't you think so, Skipper?

440
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,120
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

441
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,632
I guess a lot of people
do think it's funny,

442
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,394
because I do the dishes
and the cooking, too,

443
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,599
but they forget
how much younger Susie is than I am.

444
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,435
And as for an extra martini
once in a while...

445
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,313
<i>And so you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.</i>

446
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,990
<i>Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?</i>

447
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,557
...it's spirit.
You know, she once called me...

448
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,874
<i>Are you?</i>

449
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,269
<i>Are you now, for no reason at all...</i>

450
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,710
You wait till you see what she does
with that hardwood tray I bought her.

451
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,115
<i>...after almost 2 million miles...</i>

452
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,197
...maybe beside the little bar
she bought...

453
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,355
<i>...afraid?</i>

454
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,198
...to keep herself company
while I'm away.

455
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,117
She'll show it to everyone
who drops in

456
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,958
to keep her company when I'm away.

457
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,399
<i>But it's there.</i>

458
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,357
<i>It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.</i>

459
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,878
<i>You can almost touch it.</i>

460
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,311
She spent most of her time
riding around in it

461
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,032
so she wouldn't get too lonesome.

462
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,319
Guess she drove a little too fast...

463
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,955
<i>It's come like it has to so many others
for no reason at all...</i>

464
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,269
And besides...

465
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,551
<i>...except maybe the wear and tear
of those 2 million miles.</i>

466
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,718
...because they look like they're going
faster than they really are.

467
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,752
Like what the bartender told me
last December

468
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,508
when she was picked up
for being drunk in and about...

469
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,710
<i>They'll give you a certificate
for those 2 million miles</i>

470
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,876
<i>to hang on a wall at home.</i>

471
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,071
<i>Only, the certificate doesn't add up
to the wear and tear.</i>

472
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,398
...but the wrong word.
It's spirit she's got.

473
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,313
<i>Dan knows about it.</i>

474
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,360
<i>All the old timers say
it's only temporary,</i>

475
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,679
<i>like growing pains.</i>

476
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,758
Like this note she left me
on my last trip.

477
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,112
<i>And now, it's here for no reason at all,</i>

478
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,152
<i>and you've got to fight it,</i>

479
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,509
<i>all alone.</i>

480
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,115
"Welcome home, fatso.

481
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,959
"Got sleepy and couldn't wait
so you take a taxi.

482
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,476
"Don't make any racket when you come
home banging around the kitchen,

483
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,876
"and don't wake me up
in the morning. Love, Susie. "

484
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,439
What a sense of humour.

485
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,594
Someday, they're going to invent
a stool for navigators

486
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,518
that'll come somewhere near
fitting the human frame.

487
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,993
Ask Hobie if he can't synchronise
the props a little better.

488
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,236
I don't know
whether it's Number 1 or Number 3,

489
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,352
but one of them keeps slipping out.
It's getting on my nerves.

490
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,549
Okay.

491
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,392
Skipper says,
"What's the matter with you?

492
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,794
"Can't you keep the props together?"

493
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,239
They are together.

494
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,273
Skipper says they're out of phase.

495
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,356
One and 2 are as smooth as silk.

496
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,835
- So are 3 and 4.
- So be it.

497
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,349
The boys say the props
couldn't be smoother.

498
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,715
Yeah?

499
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,157
Well, there's something haywire.

500
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,277
Are you all right, Mr Briscoe?

501
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,715
All right?

502
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,118
Little girl,
I'm getting along like $10 million.

503
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,073
Can I get you something?

504
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,589
Perhaps a cup of tea
would taste good to you.

505
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,639
- What was that?
- It's 5:00.

506
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,437
- You mean it chimes?
- You heard it.

507
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,594
Funny thing. It happens to be
the last possession

508
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,188
I haven't signed over to someone else.

509
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,631
I wish it would chime again.

510
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,360
What a wonderful way
to keep track of the time.

511
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,677
If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait
for the next hour to come,

512
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,949
and then the next one.

513
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,799
You know something?
I used to feel the same way.

514
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,276
But right now I'm in no hurry
for the hours to pass.

515
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,229
No, the watch is yours.
I want you to have it.

516
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,715
- I couldn't think of accepting it.
- Please.

517
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,400
A watch is the last thing
I'm going to need.

518
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,314
I'd like to think of it
marking the kind of hours

519
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,237
only a young girl can have,

520
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,674
exciting hours.

521
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,600
You'll make me very happy
if you'll accept it.

522
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,990
Well, if you put it that way.

523
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,079
I can't thank you.

524
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,832
I've never met anyone like you,

525
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,520
yet I shall remember you
for the rest of my life.

526
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,632
I'd rather you remember
it's only a possession

527
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,876
and so, not worth very much.

528
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,831
I will, always.

529
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,476
We can hear it chime together again,
it needs setting, you know.

530
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,115
- It's 7:00 in San Francisco.
- Sure. I forgot.

531
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,156
Is it really 7:00, little girl?

532
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,918
As far as this aeroplane is concerned.

533
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,032
Then you know something?
I don't want tea or coffee.

534
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,914
- A glass of water?
- Water is for bathing,

535
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,033
but if you can put some Scotch in it,
I'll feel cleaner.

536
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,195
Yes, sir.

537
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,231
- It's way past my cocktail time.
- Right now.

538
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,432
How about my friend over there?
Will you join me for a drink, mister?

539
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,074
Yes, thank you very much.

540
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,075
That's awful nice music.

541
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,151
We picked up four minutes, Skipper.

542
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,510
Looks like that wind
is finally swinging around now.

543
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,675
Good.

544
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,111
I may pass a miracle
and hit San Francisco right on time.

545
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,475
- Have a Lifesaver, Skipper?
- No, thanks.

546
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,516
Let me know, will you, when we pass
the point of no return?

547
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,829
Naturally.

548
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,273
Lydia, if you're through pouting,

549
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,438
maybe we could try talking things over
in a reasonable manner.

550
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,630
We have nothing to talk over.

551
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,638
Anyone who would sell
a New York advertising agency

552
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,149
- for a broken-down mine in Canada...
- It isn't broken.

553
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,317
...just to make yourself feel important,
the big operator.

554
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,914
Operating on my money.

555
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,510
I just want to get up with the feeling
that anything I accomplish that day

556
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,073
is due to my own efforts.

557
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,714
Not because my wife happened
to inherit a business.

558
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,593
In three years I should be able
to pay you back. Every penny.

559
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,030
Three years in the wilderness
and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin

560
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,311
with my skirts around my ankles
when they ought to be around my knees

561
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,476
or the other way around.

562
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,553
For the last time, Lydia,
I'm asking you to come with me.

563
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,911
I'm glad it's the last time you're going
to make that insane request

564
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,917
so I won't have to say no again.

565
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,509
I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.

566
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,959
You're out of your head.

567
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,196
What am I supposed to do
while you clump around

568
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,912
in your boots and lumberjack shirt?

569
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,999
Have cocktails with the chipmunks?
Play bridge with the Eskimos?

570
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,678
Go on off to your primeval forest.
Play Daniel Boone,

571
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,076
get up with the pigeons or whatever
kind of birds they have up there.

572
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,633
Get calluses on your hands.

573
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,274
Be a great
dirt-under-the-fingernails boy.

574
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,437
Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.

575
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,678
Take a bath Saturday nights
and go to an Eskimo hoedown.

576
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,472
Teach them to samba, for all I care.

577
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,876
Do just as you please
if it will make you feel like a man.

578
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,073
Only don't ask me to share
your juvenile adventures.

579
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,510
It's bad enough having to pay for them.

580
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,196
- Is that your last word?
- No.

581
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,595
I've always felt your brain
would fit nicely in a demitasse.

582
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,512
Hey, fella.
You got nothing but trouble, right?

583
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,671
- I assure you...
- I know what you're going to say,

584
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,950
everything with you is hunky-dory.

585
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,913
That's the first thing a fella
in trouble always says.

586
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,989
The booby hatches are full of people
that keep things to themselves,

587
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,156
either because they're scared
to tell them the truth,

588
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,874
thinking they'll make a monkey
out of themselves,

589
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,719
or they figure no one else can
appreciate the situation they're in.

590
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,038
Okay?

591
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,078
Well, the Good Neighbours
believe that ain't so.

592
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,677
- And just who...
- A club I belong to back home.

593
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,799
It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.

594
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,312
Their luncheons are a riot.

595
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,916
Over the speaker's desk,
they've got a great big towel

596
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,635
with the letters "For Crying Out Loud"
embroidered on it.

597
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,719
And every member
has his own crying towel, get it?

598
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,999
When they bring in a bad case,
a couple of the Good Neighbours

599
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,510
hold the towel for the fella
so he can concentrate on weeping,

600
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,598
and then don't have to exert himself
in any other way.

601
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,038
It turns out to be a good
old-fashioned revival meeting

602
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,956
and the fella who has
no particular worries at the time,

603
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,953
he sort of feels left out of things.

604
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,716
And if this fella don't actually wind up
laughing at himself,

605
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,432
at least he feels better.

606
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,995
The main thing is, everybody does,

607
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,311
because nine times out of 10,

608
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,352
they think they're better off
than the other fella.

609
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,917
What do you sing at the end
of your meetings?

610
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,270
<i>Pack Up Your Troubles
in Your Old Kit Bag?</i>

611
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,628
How'd you guess?

612
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,469
When a fella comes in
with real trouble,

613
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,556
like he can't pay his income taxes,

614
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,433
or his wife just smashed up the car,

615
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,679
or his new house
shows cracks along the foundation,

616
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,199
they've got an organ that plays
real sad music.

617
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,959
It's a kick.

618
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,998
I can see how it might be.

619
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,277
Of course, a fella never comes in

620
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,478
with real troubles.

621
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,875
You know, like,

622
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,230
the guy's wife dying,

623
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,510
or his business really going broke.

624
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,155
They just confess little problems,

625
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,397
like who are they gonna get
to mow the lawn,

626
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,592
or will they ever break 100
on the golf course?

627
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,671
It's all relative, see.

628
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,789
You get the habit of laughing
at little problems

629
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,478
when they come along,

630
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,556
and then you don't blow your top

631
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,389
when the genuine,
serious things happen. Get it?

632
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,154
Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, Mr...

633
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,748
Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.

634
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,748
Getting back to your case,
maybe it'd make you feel better

635
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,518
if I cried some.

636
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,835
Then you'd understand
what the Good Neighbour means.

637
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,115
Imagine yourself with a towel.

638
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,589
Ready?

639
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,359
The wife and I scrimped
for over four years

640
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,198
to take a trip to Hawaii.

641
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,190
You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand,

642
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,872
things we ain't got at home.

643
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,795
We dreamed of the day
that we were to leave.

644
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,799
<i>So, the wife persuades a woman
to take care of our children</i>

645
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,478
<i>for $10 a day,</i>

646
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,593
<i>which is more than I made
the first five years we were married.</i>

647
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,998
<i>We got all unpacked
and were really living,</i>

648
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,877
<i>but the ship don't sail.
Strike or something.</i>

649
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,549
<i>But all right, we're lucky. We get
the last two tickets on an aeroplane,</i>

650
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,989
<i>and although we can't take
all our luggage,</i>

651
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,236
<i>we're in the land of our dreams.</i>

652
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,234
<i>At the little hotel that fits our budget,</i>

653
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,311
<i>there's a mix-up in the reservations.</i>

654
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,398
<i>Another couple named Joseph
from Milwaukee.</i>

655
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,557
<i>So we figure
maybe they've had a dream, too.</i>

656
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,716
<i>So we don't start any arguments.</i>

657
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,716
<i>We finally wind up at a hotel
which is way beyond our budget.</i>

658
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,512
<i>So we have to cut our trip short.</i>

659
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,036
<i>Okay? Comes evening,</i>

660
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,072
<i>the wife gets into the one evening dress
she could bring along</i>

661
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,078
<i>and I get into a tux
I haven't had on in 10 years.</i>

662
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,829
Mommy!

663
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,876
<i>We were ready for the light fantastic.</i>

664
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,598
<i>The wife was wearing new shoes</i>

665
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,553
<i>with heels much higher
than she was used to and...</i>

666
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,754
My back.

667
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,390
<i>The house doctor says the wife
has twisted her sacroiliac,</i>

668
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,074
<i>which ends the dancing for the trip.</i>

669
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,918
<i>So everything passes.</i>

670
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,715
<i>In a couple of days the wife is well
enough to hobble down to the beach.</i>

671
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,438
<i>It rains bullfrogs for three straight days.</i>

672
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,672
<i>All we got to do is sit around
and write postcards back home</i>

673
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,519
<i>about what a wonderful time
we're having.</i>

674
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,199
<i>Three days we got left,
then we meet the Wilsons.</i>

675
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,392
<i>One of the pleasures of any trip
should be the people you meet, right?</i>

676
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,159
<i>The Wilsons had their own ideas
of what was fun.</i>

677
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,319
<i>He thought my wife was his dish,
and she thought I was Clark Gable.</i>

678
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,878
<i>The wife can't run very fast
on account of her sacroiliac.</i>

679
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,592
<i>I'm having my own track meet.</i>

680
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,988
<i>Fella, you have never lived</i>

681
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,590
<i>until you've been chased around
the palm tree by that guy's wife.</i>

682
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,996
<i>So we spend the rest of our dream trip
eating away from the hotel</i>

683
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,999
<i>so we don't run into these people
and have to play post office all the time.</i>

684
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,274
<i>But the last day the sun comes out.</i>

685
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,790
<i>Whoever heard of coming home
from a dream trip without a tan?</i>

686
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,550
<i>We're desperate, see?
We really soaked up that sun, all day.</i>

687
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,798
The wife has a third-degree burn
on her shoulders.

688
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,512
I don't dare put any weight on my back.

689
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,796
I'm gonna have to borrow money
from the bank

690
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,469
to pay next month's food bill,
if we ever do get home.

691
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,159
If you still think you got troubles,
mister...

692
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,916
Wonder if you and Mrs Joseph
would care to join me in a drink?

693
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,875
You can have your towel back now.

694
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,554
Take a breather, Dan.
I'll turn the knobs awhile.

695
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,433
Good, I could use a little shuteye.

696
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,350
Funny thing how a fella can sleep with
four big engines hollering in his ears,

697
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,034
only wake up when they stop hollering.

698
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,034
Imagine silence
waking you up at home?

699
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,191
No human being should have to put up
with such an arrangement.

700
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,833
<i>San Francisco tollsman, 2930.</i>

701
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,076
I don't care if you did build
that radio yourself.

702
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,428
It's against the law.

703
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,118
Throw it overboard before I do.

704
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,552
But I like to listen to the aeroplanes.
I spent a long time building that set.

705
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,596
You touch my set and I'll kill you.
I might do it anyway.

706
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,599
Just to have something happen
on this rust bucket.

707
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,678
You're going off your rocker.
You need six months ashore.

708
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,993
Being shipmates with you is enough
to drive anybody off their rocker.

709
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,599
Get out of here.

710
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,399
Don't say I didn't warn you.

711
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,158
The FCC will jerk your licence
in a minute

712
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,510
if you send anything on that pile of junk.

713
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,789
Get out of here.

714
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,469
<i>Hello, Honolulu.
This is 420 with a position report.</i>

715
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,875
Come on, Honolulu. Wake up.
Answer him.

716
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,070
<i>420, this is San Francisco,</i>

717
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,873
<i>Honolulu unable to read you
on account of poor conditions.</i>

718
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,599
<i>Go ahead with your report.</i>

719
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,712
<i>Okay, San Francisco. Copy, Honolulu.</i>

720
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,956
<i>Position at 0557.</i>

721
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,116
<i>Latitude 34/30 north.</i>

722
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,030
<i>Longitude 140 west, 9,000 feet.</i>

723
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,835
<i>1,500 gallons remaining.</i>

724
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,391
<i>From the window at my side,
sometimes I can see the stars.</i>

725
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,636
<i>America is all around me in every way.</i>

726
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,949
<i>Do you understand a funny thing?</i>

727
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,078
<i>In Honolulu, I must be inspected</i>

728
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,954
<i>by the American customs
and immigration persons.</i>

729
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,273
<i>And not one soldier to guard things.</i>

730
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,117
<i>I look everywhere for soldiers
with guns and...</i>

731
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,431
Would you like your dinner now,
Miss Chen?

732
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,791
Yes. Please, I am so stupid.

733
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,593
Here is a letter to my brother in English

734
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,756
and I cannot remember this word.

735
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,274
It is that thing soldiers wear
at the end of their guns,

736
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,875
like a sword?

737
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,592
- Bayonet?
- Yes.

738
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,271
I am so very stupid. Thank you.

739
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,473
I am embarrassed.

740
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,034
Anyone who can write and read
more than one language

741
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,673
should never be embarrassed.

742
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,553
Being the original dumb-bunny,
I can barely write my own.

743
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,669
"Dumb-bunny"?

744
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,837
That's slang for mentally-retarded
American girls like me.

745
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,479
Dumb-bunny.

746
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,511
How delightful.
I must tell my brother of this.

747
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,634
You tell him you met the number one
stupid rabbit.

748
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,194
If he knows any American girls,
he'll understand.

749
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,912
Now I'll get your dinner.

750
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,433
Dumb-bunny.

751
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,435
There's something very wrong
back there. The tray...

752
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,198
- I know.
- A whole tray jumped.

753
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,073
- I burned myself.
- I swear it's that Number 1 engine.

754
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,552
It was running perfectly. They all are.

755
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,548
Maybe it's in the tail. If our little girl got
burned, maybe it's worse back there.

756
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,148
Dan, take your flashlight,
have a look through the tail.

757
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,157
- Report to me as soon as you can.
- Right.

758
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,952
Leonard, take a fast fix,

759
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,719
let me know our position now
and every 10 minutes from now.

760
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,353
Spalding, get back to your passengers.

761
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,835
If this thing lets go again,
they'll start wondering.

762
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,679
Hobie, tell San Francisco
we're experiencing

763
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,598
some unusual vibration
and to stand by until further advised.

764
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,950
Do you want to declare an emergency?

765
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,239
No, not yet.

766
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,880
- Is everything all right?
- We're still in one piece.

767
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,719
I was just starting to serve
the passengers. Should I go ahead?

768
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,159
You might as well.

769
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,748
Sometimes these things
never do get explained.

770
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,552
Say, hang up a minute, will you?

771
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,671
Tell me what's wrong
with this aeroplane.

772
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,712
- Is there something wrong with it?
- Cut it out.

773
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,832
Something popped so hard a while ago,
it spilled my drink.

774
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,080
Order another. We're not stingy.

775
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,713
You won't talk?

776
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,190
I would if there was anything to say.

777
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,275
I'll make you a bet right now,
we're late getting into San Francisco.

778
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,188
Could be.

779
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,353
- Did you find anything?
- Nope.

780
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,119
- What do you suppose it could it be?
- Beats me. Where are we?

781
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,071
I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.

782
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,633
Nothing wrong with the tail.

783
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,469
The Number 1 head temperature has
gone up five degrees in the past hour.

784
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,355
San Francisco wants to know
the nature of our trouble.

785
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,391
Tell them if we knew,
we'd have told them.

786
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,192
No, don't say that. Tell them...

787
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,515
Just say we still don't know
and to keep standing by.

788
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,916
I got news for you guys.
We just passed the point of no return.

789
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,114
- Have you lost something, Mr Agnew?
- My lighter is out of fluid.

790
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,592
Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship

791
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
and is trying to work up an appetite
for dinner.

792
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,757
I seen a crazy man act like that once.
It ain't so nice.

793
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,632
He's looking for trouble.

794
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,394
You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?
Well, isn't that your name?

795
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,872
Yeah. Why?
I don't think we've met before.

796
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,958
No. We've not met
because no one wanted us to.

797
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,192
What can I do for you?

798
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,316
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

799
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,676
Well, does that mean anything to you?

800
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,154
- Agnew. You're Martha's husband.
- I am.

801
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,632
I didn't hear you say
you were pleased to meet me.

802
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,231
- Of course...
- Of course not!

803
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,190
Look, Mr Agnew, this lady and I
are having a quiet drink together.

804
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,112
You seem to be disturbed
about something.

805
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,435
Perhaps we can talk later.
If you'll excuse...

806
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,950
No, you don't just snap your fingers
and send me on my way.

807
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,236
Mr Agnew, I don't know what's
eating you, and frankly, I don't care.

808
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,272
Why don't you go back
wherever you came from and sit down.

809
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,119
- Now, honey.
- This man's a nuisance.

810
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,277
I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.

811
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,231
I must have been
an even greater nuisance

812
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,238
when you and my wife were scheming
to avoid me in Honolulu,

813
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,272
- so you could be alone.
- You're right out of your head.

814
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,590
I took your wife to lunch twice
because she was a very nice girl.

815
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,840
And a long time ago
she happened to work for me.

816
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,719
The worst crime she is guilty of
is shaking my hand.

817
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,316
Now stop insulting her
and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.

818
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,153
I knew you'd have
some fancy explanation.

819
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,630
But I'm not such a fool
as you and my wife think I am.

820
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,270
I'm going to let you wonder
what I'm going to do.

821
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,075
Wonder and think and think,
as I've been doing.

822
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,636
I've heard about you for years
and I'm sick of the sound of your name.

823
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,189
You're quite a conqueror
with the ladies, aren't you?

824
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,231
That should interest you, madam.

825
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,477
- I've had enough of this.
- What's the matter with you guys?

826
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,716
- Hey, what's this all about?
- Easy, break it up.

827
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,353
He's crazy, he's got a gun.

828
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,512
We're on fire!

829
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,118
- Pull the bottle on it.
- Hobie, pull the bottle quick!

830
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,870
- Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco.
- San Francisco 420.

831
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,472
The prop! The whole prop is gone.

832
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,158
Yes, and you may lose your engine, too.

833
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,794
- She's off her mountings.
- Pull the other bottle, Dan.

834
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,957
- I'm starting for the water.
- San Francisco 420.

835
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,955
Thank you, sweet Lord.

836
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,116
I don't think she's gonna burn any more.

837
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,798
I can't raise San Francisco. Static.

838
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,911
- Try the secondary frequency.
- I've tried both.

839
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,792
Use emergency.
Give them a mayday call.

840
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,399
- Are we going into the water?
- No.

841
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,476
She flies lousy
with that engine hanging down,

842
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,953
but I think we can stay in the air.

843
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,718
- How long to the coast?
- Six hours, about.

844
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,116
But at regular cruising speed. I've not
figured it out for this sort of thing.

845
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,355
Figure it!

846
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,549
...mayday 420.

847
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,155
Mayday 420, anybody.

848
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,678
I got somebody. A ship.

849
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,396
<i>This is the Cristobal Trader calling 420.
I can hear you very clearly.</i>

850
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,678
You passed right over me
about 20 minutes ago.

851
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,837
Do you want me to relay
all your messages? Over.

852
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,669
Roger. Advise San Francisco
we've lost Number 1 propeller.

853
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,637
Fire started but is now out.

854
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,075
We are now at 5,000, but sinking.

855
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,078
Request they clear
all altitudes below us. Over.

856
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,798
Will do. Stand by.

857
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,157
<i>This is Cristobal Trader
calling San Francisco.</i>

858
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,713
Clear sea rescue from Oakland Control.

859
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,115
Right.

860
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,275
<i>Warm up the ready plane. Intercept.</i>

861
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,598
San Francisco wants to know
if you are going to ditch. Over.

862
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,835
Negative for now.

863
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,599
What's the state of the sea
about you, just in case. Over.

864
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,110
Heavy northwest swells.
We are rolling about 30 degrees.

865
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,676
It's very rough.
Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.

866
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,149
It's wet down here. Over.

867
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,555
<i>Thank you, Cristobal Trader. We'll try.</i>

868
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,633
Attaboy, papa.

869
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,515
Some of these days, I'm gonna
get smart and go back to buttons.

870
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,596
- What's the poop?
- Eastbound lost a prop.

871
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,075
Had a fire but that's out.
Looks like he's headed for the drink.

872
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,997
- How far out is he?
-1,000 miles maybe.

873
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,473
My aching eyes!

874
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,239
This might well be my last show
and not a laugh in it.

875
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,955
I shouldn't have screamed,
but I was so scared.

876
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,674
My own heart is just returning
from the ceiling.

877
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,356
Troubles? Wait till I tell
the Good Neighbours about this.

878
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,796
I was almost asleep when someone
pulled the champagne cork.

879
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,319
This could become interesting.

880
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,034
Things were pretty interesting
before this happened.

881
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,798
Two apes were trying to kill each other.

882
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,275
Why don't you be a good boy
and go back and sit down.

883
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,118
I'm sure everything will be all right.

884
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,198
They'll come back from the flight deck
and explain in a minute.

885
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,392
I'm just gonna keep this for you
till we make San Francisco.

886
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,829
You can get in plenty trouble
with them things.

887
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,030
I'll get coffee for everyone.

888
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,952
Did you know space guns don't kill you?

889
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,069
No.

890
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,838
They just make you stiff.

891
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,955
You know, the funny part of all this,

892
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,356
is that for the first time
in my whole life, I'm innocent.

893
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,312
What I told him was the truth,
so help me.

894
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,514
This is gonna cost the taxpayers
a lot of money.

895
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,471
What would you have them do?
Swim home?

896
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,512
No Alameda, this is the Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Centre.

897
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,153
- New position, Skipper!
- Name it!

898
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,113
To the coast, 5 hours, 47 minutes,
if we can hold this air speed.

899
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,152
- How's our fuel?
- Enough. Just.

900
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,071
We'll only need about 1,150 gallons,
we've 1,300 according to my graph.

901
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,873
- It's pinching things close...
- You can throw your graph away.

902
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,798
- Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.
- How do you figure that?

903
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,959
The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons
when we lost our prop.

904
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,475
My guess is that when the prop left us,

905
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,909
it kicked holes in the wing.
Ruptured the tank.

906
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,953
We just can't make it this way.
I'll figure it up again, but the winds,

907
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,799
- maybe they'll change some.
- We're going into the drink.

908
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,911
It's just a question of when and where.

909
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,828
We've got plenty of time. Let's not rush
off into the heat of the day about this.

910
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,951
Let's hold on a while
and see what the wind does.

911
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,594
- We'll be closer to the coast.
- Water will be colder there.

912
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,918
And probably rougher, but I still think we
should stretch it out as long as we can.

913
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,155
I'll go along with you on that.

914
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,635
It'll give us more time
to get squared away.

915
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,479
I want you up here with me
when we really start down.

916
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,272
Meantime get everything
you can overboard.

917
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,119
Thousand pounds or so
will make a difference in our speed.

918
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,073
You want me to tell them
they're going into the drink?

919
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,232
Use your own judgement.

920
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,914
I guess I don't have to tell you people
that we've had a little trouble.

921
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,391
Maybe if I explain
exactly what has happened,

922
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,034
you'll feel better all around.

923
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,434
I'm not gonna minimise it,

924
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,394
nor will I make it any tougher
than it really is.

925
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,319
We've lost our Number 1 propeller.

926
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,711
This is just one of those things
that never happens but does

927
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,115
once in a billion flying miles.

928
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,154
We've extinguished the fire
with the carbon dioxide,

929
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,430
so there's no further danger from that.

930
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,552
But our speed has been considerably
slowed down

931
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,429
because the Number 1 motor
is partially twisted in its mountings,

932
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,517
causing a severe drag,

933
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,712
sort of like dragging your feet
in a rowboat.

934
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,431
I can't blame you
if you are a little scared, I am, too.

935
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,514
I've been flying since 1917

936
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,712
and I don't like this sort of thing
any better than you do.

937
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,469
However, with all that flying,
you'll notice that

938
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,636
I'm still very much alive.

939
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,998
Now comes the hard part.

940
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,552
- Can you take it?
- Please, tell us everything.

941
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,998
I think we all want to know.

942
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,154
We're really very lucky.

943
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,636
That propeller could have done
a great deal more damage.

944
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,792
Anyway, there are several holes in
the wing, that's where our fuel is stored.

945
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,029
Which means that we can't quite make
the California coast.

946
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,998
Can't we go back to Honolulu?

947
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,317
We'd already past the point
of no return when it happened.

948
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,238
We will probably have to ditch
this plane in the sea.

949
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,920
We'll all be killed.

950
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,356
There's just a chance that you'll only be
in the water a few minutes.

951
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,358
There's a rescue plane
already on its way to intercept us.

952
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,995
Before we actually have to go in
there'll probably be several more.

953
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,997
Some of which can land on water.

954
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,431
And surface vessels
will be directed toward us.

955
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,315
Aeroplanes have gone
into the water before

956
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:05,075
and no one received the slightest injury,
except maybe a little dampening.

957
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,796
Casualties come from panic.

958
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,112
So you must not hurry.

959
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,233
Miss Spalding and our second officer,
Mr Wheeler, will be back here with you.

960
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,396
Do exactly as they tell you.

961
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,509
Aeroplanes have been known to float
for so long that

962
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,428
they became a menace to navigation
and had to be sunk by gunfire.

963
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,358
They've been known to sink
in a few minutes, too.

964
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,631
This is an inflatable life raft.

965
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,988
It's really a wonderful gadget.

966
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,350
It's got everything in it
but T-bone steaks.

967
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,557
It will hold all of you very comfortably.

968
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,274
Mr Wheeler, our second officer,
will be in charge.

969
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,789
He will tell you
when to take off your shoes.

970
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,036
We don't want anybody kicking holes
in this raft.

971
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,197
Miss Spalding will show you
where the emergency rations are,

972
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,355
when you get hungry.

973
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,677
How're we gonna get hungry if we're
only gonna be in the raft a few minutes?

974
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,518
Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?

975
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,518
Maybe a little,
but we just don't want bad things said

976
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,200
about the service
and cuisine on this airline.

977
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,912
No doubt there'll be caviar.

978
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,679
It would be most arduous
if there were no caviar.

979
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,910
I'll speak to the emergency chef.

980
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,996
I don't think
this is anything to joke about.

981
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,429
You're wrong.
The more jokes, the better.

982
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,592
When you get in that raft,
you might even try singing.

983
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,956
I was once a fair-to-middling bass.

984
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,231
I can't carry a tune in a basket,
but I'm sure loud.

985
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,991
Now, this is very important.

986
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,839
When we actually go in,
there will be two shocks.

987
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,993
If you know about them in advance,
they won't frighten you.

988
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,351
The first will be hardly noticeable,
like a normal landing.

989
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,512
But the second may be quite severe,
so brace yourselves.

990
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,797
Soon after that, the lights will go out,

991
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,957
but Miss Spalding and Mr Wheeler
both have flashlights.

992
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,391
So unfasten your seat belts
and wait for his call.

993
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,079
And keep calm.

994
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,829
Now, is there anything
you don't understand?

995
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,916
Could we send a radio message
to our families?

996
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,952
They were gonna meet us at the airport.
They will be standing.

997
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,355
I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy

998
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,199
giving our position
and contacting the rescue plane.

999
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,710
I've some important papers
in my briefcase, many years of work.

1000
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,398
Can I take them with me?

1001
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,835
Not unless you can stuff them
in your pockets.

1002
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,837
No baggage of any kind.

1003
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,878
Come to think about it,

1004
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,639
the bottom of the sea
is the best place for them.

1005
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,515
And one thing more.
Now, don't get your hopes up.

1006
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,356
There is one chance in a thousand
that we can make the coast.

1007
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,557
This isn't possible unless there is
a marked change in the wind.

1008
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,513
And according to our forecast,
it just couldn't happen.

1009
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,633
But it could. And the one thing
we can do right now to help matters

1010
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,196
is to lighten ship.
That way we'll use slightly less fuel.

1011
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,119
If any of you gentlemen have ever had
an urge to throw things out of windows,

1012
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,430
this is your chance of a lifetime.

1013
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,359
What about us girls?
I love to throw things.

1014
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,596
Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.

1015
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,794
I'd better stick with the wife. She's
awfully worried about our children.

1016
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,713
Please, let me help.

1017
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,958
I'll sue the airline for this,
I'm not supposed to exert myself.

1018
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,516
- The doctor says my heart...
- Your heart is breaking my heart.

1019
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,310
We can get rid of some of this baggage
if you gentlemen will come with me,

1020
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,750
and the rest of you
form a line clear back to the door.

1021
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,350
My new Mainbocher frock is in here.

1022
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,869
The insurance company
isn't gonna like this.

1023
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,119
What a wonderful excuse
to get a new wardrobe.

1024
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,116
Be kind of nice
if he came through all this

1025
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,398
and didn't know a thing about it.

1026
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,552
I need a big man.

1027
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,229
Interested?

1028
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,432
- Fascinated.
- Grab me around the waist.

1029
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,033
All right, start kicking things out,
but be careful.

1030
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,388
Keep behind me,
it's lonesome out there.

1031
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,553
That does it.

1032
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,071
Now all we have to do is wait.

1033
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,708
Excuse me.

1034
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,670
My kids, they like to hear me play this.

1035
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,152
- Aren't you coming back to our seat?
- I'm staying here.

1036
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,475
I can't stand that crying towel.

1037
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,356
Hobie, give me 2,250 rpm.

1038
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,599
Crack the cowl flaps.
Watch those head temperatures.

1039
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,637
Give me another inch of boost!

1040
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,793
Look at the fuel, Skipper,
the flow meters, we're pouring it in.

1041
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,072
I can't help it. This turbulence is slowing
us down and we can't climb out of it!

1042
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,473
Have a cup of coffee.

1043
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,311
- I'm plenty hot enough now.
- Then it will cool you off.

1044
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,920
Of course you're worried, Mrs Joseph.

1045
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,838
But I'm quite certain
we'll get out of this all right.

1046
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,509
By tomorrow we can look back on it
as an interesting experience.

1047
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,278
By the by, how old are your children?

1048
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,116
Jennifer is six and Edward is four.

1049
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,438
Jennifer is such a delightful name,
Mrs Joseph. How fortunate you are.

1050
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,792
Jennifer has always brought to me
the suggestion of the Scottish moor,

1051
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,433
heather, great peace,

1052
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,912
and visions of little villages
nestled against the hills.

1053
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,192
That sort of thing.

1054
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,710
Is your Jennifer anything like that?

1055
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,239
I don't know exactly what you mean,
but she's always been a quiet child.

1056
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,475
Precisely.

1057
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,678
Somehow I knew your Jennifer
would be like that.

1058
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,594
And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing
so fast you can't buy shoes for him.

1059
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,078
Every three weeks.

1060
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,636
Why don't you try to rest now?

1061
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,197
Later I'd like to hear
a great deal more about your children.

1062
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,155
I thought you hated
the mere mention of children.

1063
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,508
I do.

1064
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,030
But that poor woman is terrified.
I think I helped her.

1065
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,670
For 10 years you've said that
love was a word in the dictionary

1066
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,791
and children were monsters.

1067
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,196
And you would never go two inches
out of your way to help anybody.

1068
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,390
What goes, Gustave?

1069
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,757
I've never seen you this way.

1070
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,314
You've forgotten yourself
for a whole hour.

1071
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,273
You've been magnificent.

1072
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,519
Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence.

1073
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,512
You told that woman
we'd get out of this all right.

1074
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,517
- Do you really believe that?
- No.

1075
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,998
In spite of what that pilot said, I think
we're batting at a very sticky wicket.

1076
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,198
- And yet you're not afraid?
- Yes and no.

1077
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,598
I'm not sure just how I feel.

1078
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,750
If I were openly afraid now,
some of the others might become so.

1079
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,069
I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics
right after the fire

1080
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,316
and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.

1081
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,516
I just want to know one thing.

1082
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,320
What happened to the biggest baby
in the world?

1083
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,632
The child-man who was afraid to sleep
with the lights off.

1084
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,957
You used to burst into tears
if the laundry put starch in your shirts,

1085
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,150
or the crepe suzette was underdone.

1086
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,112
I don't understand you, Gustave.
I guess I never will.

1087
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,948
Maybe it isn't important
to understand you

1088
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,995
like the other women
you've always managed to keep around.

1089
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:30,438
I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain
with a throwback, a Roman emperor.

1090
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,869
You bought me on the market, Gustave,
paid for me,

1091
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,470
like you might pay for a play
which you thought might turn out well.

1092
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,356
For 10 years I've lived with that thought
and hated it.

1093
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,516
Now it'll never bother me again.

1094
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,189
Gustave, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

1095
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:04,916
And if we don't get out of this,
I'd like you to know it even more.

1096
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,630
I've never said it before

1097
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,999
and probably you'll never want me
to say it again.

1098
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,793
What else is on your twisted little mind?

1099
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,912
I'm in love with you, Gustave.

1100
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,270
I guess I always have been.

1101
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,870
And then you tie the ribbons like this.

1102
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,995
These preservers are not inflated now.

1103
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,794
If you jerk this cord on either side,

1104
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,195
carbon dioxide will be released
from the capsules

1105
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,151
and the vest will inflate immediately.

1106
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,474
That's all there is to it.

1107
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,160
- Any calls for me?
- Take your pick.

1108
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,992
Boyd, public relations.

1109
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,159
No, Tommy.
We've not lost an aeroplane.

1110
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,790
I'm standing right here in Operations
and our plane is still in the air.

1111
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,435
Yeah, we had a little trouble. No,
I don't know the passengers' names.

1112
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,391
Yeah, okay.

1113
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,637
Where's Garfield? This jerk newspaper
wants a statement from the manager.

1114
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,069
He's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

1115
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,997
Boyd, public relations.

1116
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,750
Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown
over 30 million passenger miles

1117
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,836
without ever scratching a passenger.

1118
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,632
Sure we want to cooperate.

1119
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,752
You'll get the straight dope,
just give me time to get organised.

1120
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,472
Goodbye.

1121
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,318
Mr Garfield, can you give me a minute?

1122
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,158
Just about. What's your trouble?

1123
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,874
The papers are on my neck already.
What will I tell them?

1124
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,877
How about "drop dead" for an opener?

1125
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,639
- You know I can't do that.
- I know.

1126
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,354
- How long can you stall them?
- I don't know, maybe an hour.

1127
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,277
They're crying about morning editions.

1128
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,073
An hour might be enough.
We've got real trouble.

1129
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,631
Does it look that bad?

1130
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,238
It don't look good.

1131
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,198
Is everything all right with you two?

1132
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,756
I don't know when I've felt better
in the last five years.

1133
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,677
I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl I
would most like to be on a life raft with.

1134
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,117
Of course, now,
she may prefer a younger man.

1135
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,635
There is in my family a very old saying.

1136
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,954
I will try to translate it for you.

1137
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,235
"The youth of man will never die

1138
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,916
"unless he murders it. "

1139
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,752
I plead not guilty.

1140
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,553
I just want to show you
how to use your life vest.

1141
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,831
My neck won't stand any weight,

1142
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,997
and my bones are only held together
by my imagination.

1143
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,793
A burial at sea will save my heirs
a lot of money.

1144
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,756
- I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.
- Why do that?

1145
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,718
You just look more comfortable
that way, Mr Briscoe.

1146
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,596
You impress me
as the open-collar type anyway.

1147
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,274
Rugged, you know.

1148
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,038
- Outdoorsy, you mean?
- Yes.

1149
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,033
You behave yourself.

1150
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,038
I'll be coming back to make sure
you're being nice to Miss Chen.

1151
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:15,630
It's a rough assignment
for an outdoor man without his horse,

1152
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,751
but I'll do my best.

1153
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,030
Would you like
to put your vests on now?

1154
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:26,113
Investigation will undoubtedly prove this
aeroplane was ready for the junk heap.

1155
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,437
And we're in the hands of incompetents.

1156
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,473
I don't want to make no trouble,
but why don't you shut up?

1157
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,919
You hate me, don't you?

1158
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,554
All of you hate me
because I tried to do what was right.

1159
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,796
Do like the little lady says.

1160
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,911
Don't touch me, please.

1161
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,350
You're giving me a very bad time,
Mr Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.

1162
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,595
I have a perfect right...

1163
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,712
You got no rights at all
for some time to come.

1164
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,557
Do like she says or no life vest
is gonna keep you from drowning

1165
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,389
because I'm gonna hold your head
under till you stop wiggling.

1166
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,956
If we should happen to go down,
I'll give you plenty of warning.

1167
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,117
Cross your arms like this
right in front of your face.

1168
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,880
Brace your hands
on the seat just ahead.

1169
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,549
Bend your head down
between your arms,

1170
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,433
and keep them there
until we've stopped completely.

1171
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,598
Remember to remove your shoes.

1172
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,756
You men should loosen
your collar and tie.

1173
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,233
Why?

1174
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,237
According to the ditching instructions,

1175
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,920
there is less possibility
of breaking your neck.

1176
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,519
Anything from 420?

1177
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,877
Not a sound out of them, sir.

1178
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,868
Those people,
if they have to ditch tonight

1179
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,434
with the way that wind's
kicking up that sea,

1180
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,155
they don't stand much of a chance,
I'm thinking.

1181
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,517
<i>Cristobal Trader from San Francisco.</i>

1182
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,871
<i>We can work the aircraft clearly now.
Thanks for your help. Over.</i>

1183
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,718
<i>Good. Muchas gracias.</i>

1184
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:11,789
<i>Cristobal Trader over and out.</i>

1185
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,397
How about letting me take over
for a while? Save yourself for later.

1186
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,192
- We'll need you.
- All right.

1187
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,878
Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.

1188
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,754
Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left. But if the
winds are right we can make it.

1189
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,078
We picked up four minutes
in the past hour. I figured it all out.

1190
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,998
If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes,
we're safe.

1191
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,554
Hey, Skipper,
the interceptor is calling us.

1192
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,595
We estimate our position
at 145 miles east of you.

1193
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,877
Expect interception
in approximately 20 minutes.

1194
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,439
Get a bearing on him.

1195
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,719
We will transmit every three minutes
from now on.

1196
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,355
When your needle begins to
fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.

1197
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,750
We will then be very close to you.

1198
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,511
You should have a bearing by now.
How about it?

1199
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,559
We're gonna make it.

1200
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,389
Five degrees north of our course.
We're awful glad to know you're around.

1201
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,837
We know what you mean.
Say, can you guys climb any higher?

1202
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,389
Out of this stuff
interception would be a lot easier.

1203
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,671
Negative. We can climb, but we don't
want to use the fuel to do it.

1204
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,711
Every gallon's a mile nearer shore
for us.

1205
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,598
Okay. We'll find you anyway.

1206
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,318
- Are you still afraid?
- No, my darling.

1207
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,439
I don't mean the aeroplane.
I mean us, our future.

1208
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,317
I'm not afraid of anything now.

1209
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,873
I can't hear you.

1210
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,711
How could I ever be afraid
when you hold me like this?

1211
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:50,632
- I love you.
- Darling.

1212
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,989
No.

1213
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,871
Just think where we are.

1214
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,309
I'm thinking how awful it would be

1215
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,159
if this was the last time
I could hold you so.

1216
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,392
- We'll have years, all our lives.
- If this aeroplane makes it.

1217
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,480
Careful, darling.

1218
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,829
Howard.

1219
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,395
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

1220
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,355
Would you be sorry if I drowned?

1221
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,788
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I have to know.

1222
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,397
I'd be more than sorry.

1223
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,114
You could go off to your North woods.

1224
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,712
It's occurred to me
that trying to make a go at that mine

1225
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,115
might turn out to be a bad dream.

1226
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,319
But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.

1227
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:15,829
It was.

1228
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:21,635
I could switch things back.
I suppose that would please you.

1229
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,512
I'd only lose you.

1230
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,672
A few hours ago,
you insisted on getting rid of me.

1231
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,829
At times I'm a very stupid
and selfish woman.

1232
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,028
I think you should go up to your mine.

1233
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,874
That's you.

1234
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,080
And you might take me along for laughs.

1235
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,598
I'm hearing things.

1236
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,398
You'd be miserable.

1237
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,034
No doubt.

1238
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,753
But I want you.

1239
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,869
The guy I had sense enough to marry.

1240
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,391
If I choke on hotcakes, or try to put
evening gowns on the natives,

1241
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:13,159
or have cocktails with the sled dogs,
you'll just have to be patient with me.

1242
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,434
You don't have to, but I wish you would.

1243
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,555
Mush! That's what you say
to a sled dog, isn't it?

1244
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,196
I want to start practising.

1245
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,832
Makes them turn left,
if you yell it loud enough.

1246
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,511
You're very good.

1247
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,837
- Can you get that through to Sullivan?
- I can try.

1248
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,554
- Everything else buttoned up?
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,596
- Any improvement in the local weather?
- I'm afraid not.

1250
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,279
- Radar, anything yet?
- No target, sir.

1251
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,992
Navigator, how's our position
for interception?

1252
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,316
Dead on. Just got a loran fix.

1253
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:23,278
We should be joining now,
if their navigator is anywhere near right.

1254
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,516
- Radar?
- No target, sir.

1255
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,638
- Somebody's wrong.
- We should be right on top of them.

1256
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,229
We can easily miss this guy.

1257
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,793
No target, sir.

1258
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:53,955
That navigator's wacky.
We're already seven minutes overdue.

1259
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,469
Radar?

1260
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:01,035
Target, Skipper. Strong blip.
Four degrees left, eight miles.

1261
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,873
Looks like he's 500 feet below us.

1262
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,752
<i>Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?</i>

1263
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,877
What happened to the 11 minutes
you were counting on?

1264
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,190
What happened to them, fatso?

1265
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,034
You never could make them up,
you just thought you could.

1266
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:35,029
- Lennie, what about it?
- Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.

1267
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,269
Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.

1268
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:52,357
Find the minutes,
and you can come back to me.

1269
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,838
Minutes.

1270
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,317
Who's got the minutes?

1271
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,874
Your Susie's got them, right here.

1272
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,476
Come on, Lennie.
What's holding things up?

1273
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,034
The Coast Guard says
your position's wrong.

1274
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,310
I'll be right with you, Skipper.

1275
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,034
Skipper?

1276
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,673
I got bad news.

1277
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:28,351
The Coast Guard was right.
I made a dumb kid's mistake.

1278
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,476
We're not as close to the coast
as I thought we were.

1279
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,239
I was figuring in knots instead of miles.

1280
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,996
I guess I was just scared.

1281
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,872
What about those 11 minutes?

1282
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,912
They can make the difference
between the water and your own bed.

1283
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,553
They aren't there.

1284
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,272
They never were there.

1285
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,992
I'm sorry, Skipper.

1286
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,477
I hope this will float.

1287
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,393
<i>I am so excited about your arrival,
Sally.</i>

1288
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:34,429
<i>Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains
and pines, which will be your home, too,</i>

1289
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,075
<i>and go down to the city
for my first visit in over a year.</i>

1290
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,869
<i>I want to get there
a few days before you arrive,</i>

1291
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,275
<i>because there are some things
this cabin needs</i>

1292
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,960
<i>to make it more comfortable for a girl.</i>

1293
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,238
<i>I'm still scared you won't like it up here,</i>

1294
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:03,351
<i>unless you're nuts about
the sound of a mountain stream,</i>

1295
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:07,553
<i>or love to watch the sun seem to turn
a mountain peak around very slow.</i>

1296
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,469
Hey, Henry.

1297
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,869
<i>One of our neighbours
just came by to say hello.</i>

1298
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,956
<i>A little fawn I call Henry.</i>

1299
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,351
<i>He seems to ask,
"Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"</i>

1300
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,879
<i>So hurry, girl!</i>

1301
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,749
<i>So you'll be sure to recognise me
at the airport,</i>

1302
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,189
<i>I'll be wearing a bright green tie.</i>

1303
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,595
<i>P.S. I was just thinking how lucky I am.</i>

1304
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:41,029
<i>I happened to pick up
an old torn magazine</i>

1305
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,516
<i>and there is your picture,
smacking me right between the eyes.</i>

1306
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:48,235
<i>And only a short time later,
that very wonderful-looking little girl</i>

1307
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,316
<i>is coming to share my life.</i>

1308
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,034
Remarkable.

1309
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,272
What's so remarkable?

1310
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,638
Is it faith or just habit
that compels a woman

1311
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,832
to put on fresh makeup
before boarding a life raft?

1312
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,236
Aren't you jumping the gun?

1313
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,797
You're being a fatalist
about this business then?

1314
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,640
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1315
01:43:35,675 --> 01:43:35,992
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1316
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,829
How can you sit there so calmly then,

1317
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,110
when a little while ago
you were terrified?

1318
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:45,952
I sat down here with you because
I thought I might be able to help you.

1319
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,912
But I'm not needed.

1320
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,717
If you came over to give me help,

1321
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,798
it was partly because
you needed help yourself,

1322
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,628
very badly.

1323
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,078
Don't worry about me.

1324
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,555
I've just stopped worrying
about losing something

1325
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:07,274
I never had a chance to get
in the first place.

1326
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,756
Would the thing be a man?
Or am I getting too personal?

1327
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,675
You are.

1328
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,672
I don't care anymore.

1329
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,194
I've been kidding myself long enough.

1330
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,070
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

1331
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,237
What are you hiding from?

1332
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:28,875
Myself.

1333
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,472
He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.

1334
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,752
He has a right to know
what kind of a person I am.

1335
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,871
I'm going to tell him

1336
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,310
that I'm a different kind of person
than he thinks I am.

1337
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,392
I'm not wonderful,

1338
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:54,789
not kind, I'm not clean.

1339
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,157
Telling you these things is easy,
because you're a stranger

1340
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,350
and I'll never see you again.

1341
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,038
Telling him is...

1342
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,830
It's going to be one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life,

1343
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,192
'cause in my heart,

1344
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,032
I'll always see him

1345
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,273
even when he turns his back
and walks away.

1346
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,593
Look at my face.

1347
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,117
Wouldn't you walk away?

1348
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,239
I'm so much older
than my years have made me.

1349
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,440
Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.

1350
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,030
You'll see how very old I am.

1351
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,149
I'm beat.

1352
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,315
I'll make a swell-looking bride.

1353
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,113
A beat bride.

1354
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,476
But I'm not afraid anymore.

1355
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,756
Now that I know what's going to happen,
I'm almost happy.

1356
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,832
So, I wasn't making up my face
a few minutes ago.

1357
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:23,475
I was looking in the mirror, at me.

1358
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:29,000
Does that answer your question,
mister?

1359
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,999
I was mistaken.

1360
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,755
You aren't a fatalist.
You're a very courageous young lady.

1361
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,595
Maybe some of it will brush off on me
if I keep sitting here.

1362
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:47,637
Maybe I can throw a few things
out of my own life.

1363
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:11,392
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't use them things.

1364
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,596
- Do you have to do that?
- Yeah.

1365
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,789
Could I have my property back now?

1366
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,037
- Why?
- It would mean a great deal to me.

1367
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,112
Take away this feeling
of being constantly watched.

1368
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:40,472
I'm all right, now. Quite calm.
You can trust me.

1369
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:52,549
Sit down.

1370
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:58,790
You got lots to think about,
and maybe not so much time for to do it.

1371
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,756
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

1372
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,270
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1373
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,197
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1374
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,629
hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come...

1375
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,393
Sparks, get on the horn.

1376
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,750
Advised interception completed at 56.

1377
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,317
Okay, Dan. I'll take over.

1378
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,311
Go back now. Take the Gibson girl,
get the passengers all set.

1379
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,351
You'll have plenty of time.

1380
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:13,758
Turn on the seat belt sign 10 minutes
before we start for the water.

1381
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,438
Good luck, you guys.

1382
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,119
- Anything new with the wind, Lennie?
- No.

1383
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,317
We're not very fat, then?

1384
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:39,116
- If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.
- Eleven minutes? Is that all you need?

1385
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:42,598
- Are you sure?
- I know exactly where we are now.

1386
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,155
Eleven minutes more of fuel
would see us through.

1387
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:49,512
What increase in wind velocity would
we need to arrange that little thing?

1388
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,551
Twenty knots in the next hour.

1389
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,796
- That's asking a lot.
- Yeah.

1390
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,670
It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.

1391
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,360
But if the wind swung around
a little more in the tail

1392
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:00,754
it could be.

1393
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,713
I guess they'll pick us up
before we get too damp.

1394
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,671
Susie will sure be worried.

1395
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,236
She'll lay down the law.
Probably insist I quit flying.

1396
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,314
Will you?

1397
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,589
No.

1398
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:31,197
- Everything's here. I just hope it works.
- It will.

1399
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,749
Wouldn't you rather
not have to depend on it?

1400
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,599
- What do you mean?
- Suppose we didn't ditch.

1401
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:39,994
You've got to.

1402
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,394
Lennie says all we need
is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.

1403
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,999
Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.

1404
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,395
Would you think I was wrong
if I tried to talk him out of it?

1405
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,837
Maybe try a little luck?

1406
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,115
Luck?

1407
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,311
That's has-been thinking.

1408
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,948
Wanna run out of fuel,
right over San Francisco?

1409
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,753
Wipe out a few bridges
or apartment houses?

1410
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:09,873
Sullivan's been over this ocean
lots of times. He knows his business.

1411
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,835
I've seen men act like this before.

1412
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,678
Sometimes because of one thing
or another,

1413
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,308
fella stops thinking straight temporarily.

1414
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,910
I've been flying a long time, Hobie.

1415
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,958
Only, you're not the captain.

1416
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,672
Maybe because your so-called luck

1417
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,519
ran out on you once
down in South America.

1418
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,711
This is no luck operation.

1419
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:46,718
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1420
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,949
Maybe.

1421
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:52,950
Here it is, Lennie.
Colour may not become you

1422
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,116
- but it'll suffice you.
- Thanks, for nothing.

1423
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:04,235
About that 11 minutes,
are you absolutely sure?

1424
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,034
Absolutely.

1425
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,516
Lennie says if we can pick up
11 minutes, we can make it.

1426
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,318
He could be right.

1427
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,276
It'll be rough down there.
If we hit wrong, we've had it.

1428
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:40,476
Maybe we ought to ease off a little on
the power and save a few drops of fuel.

1429
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,636
Any objections if I try it?

1430
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,990
This won't work.
She's going to stall on me.

1431
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,156
That's no good.
We'll blow another engine.

1432
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:57,272
What's the difference?
We'll blow them all if we ditch.

1433
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:00,393
Put those controls back
where they belong.

1434
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,520
- Put those props back.
- Nothing doing, Skipper.

1435
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,119
That's an order!

1436
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,631
Hang on, chum. You can do it.
Now fly and let me pray.

1437
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,796
We'll run out of gas,
right over San Francisco.

1438
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,993
Let's try out this way for a while.
Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!

1439
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,795
- She's starting to shake again.
- Let her shake!

1440
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:22,151
Let her mush down a few feet if you
have to. We're saving fuel this way.

1441
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,679
Hang on and fly!

1442
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,598
Did you call Sullivan's wife?

1443
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,870
Yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport.

1444
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,479
- You didn't alarm her?
- No.

1445
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:40,036
I just told her, her husband was on
his way, and that you wanted to see her.

1446
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:41,912
Then she knows something's happened.

1447
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,634
Probably. But her voice was quite calm.

1448
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,958
How about the others?

1449
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:50,709
Wheeler lives with another pilot,
Dupree. There was no answer.

1450
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,832
The same for Wilby.

1451
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:56,835
I called his home
and then a bar I know about.

1452
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:00,711
His wife had been there,
but she left about an hour ago,

1453
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,909
drunk.

1454
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:07,317
- The stewardess?
- No, Spalding's mother isn't well.

1455
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,954
Her father is out of town on business.

1456
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,831
I wish I could tell them all together.

1457
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,554
I think maybe they could
help each other.

1458
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:18,399
There isn't anybody listed on there
for Dan Roman.

1459
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:21,592
- Do you know any person close to him?
- Yeah.

1460
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:25,716
But I don't think you could reach her.
Dan lives alone.

1461
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,593
- Is everything all right?
- Just great, junior.

1462
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,271
This is a stunning garment.

1463
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,268
I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.

1464
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,359
It's a frowsy looking shroud,
if you ask me.

1465
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,069
Baby.

1466
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,274
I went through the first World War
and the Blitz in London.

1467
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,755
I was scared, but not like this.

1468
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:34,069
I want to show you something cute.
Want to see something cute?

1469
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,352
I must be slipping.

1470
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:41,632
No reaction, even from a man like you,
who should appreciate such things.

1471
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,595
Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.

1472
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,999
I'm frightened.

1473
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:55,157
Talking. Honey, you don't know
what you're asking.

1474
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:57,870
I'll tell you a good joke on me.

1475
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,151
You know, I always dreaded
the idea of becoming an old woman,

1476
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:05,478
and from the way things look now,
I won't have to worry about it anymore.

1477
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,516
You know, I haven't been whistled at
in years.

1478
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,358
And the idea of growing roses

1479
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:14,472
for the rest of my life
was really beginning to haunt me.

1480
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:19,831
There ought to be a home
for dames like me.

1481
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,712
We should have organised.

1482
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:25,677
You know, a house somewhere
with no mirror in it.

1483
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:30,076
Far away, where we'd never have
to look at a young girl.

1484
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,348
They have homes
for unmarried mothers.

1485
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,598
But everybody forgets
about the girls who

1486
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:40,795
never quite managed
to make things legal.

1487
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,711
I think I could start one.

1488
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,516
I can call it the "May Holst Home
for Broken-down Broads. "

1489
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,990
I kind of like that, don't you?

1490
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,960
Well, they're as ready now
as they'll ever be.

1491
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,350
Can you take something else
in your stride?

1492
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,469
I can try.

1493
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,669
Good.

1494
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,677
I want you to do me a favour.

1495
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:22,436
Look, when I tell you, sit down there
with your back against that seat,

1496
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,630
stay there,
no matter what else is going on.

1497
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,513
Don't try to be a heroine
because in those last few moments,

1498
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,996
there isn't anything in the world
you can do to help anybody.

1499
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:33,429
You know, your face
can improve any landscape.

1500
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,152
I want you to keep it that way.

1501
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,838
So the favour for me is this pillow.

1502
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,077
Hold it tightly over your face,
for yourself and for me.

1503
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,509
With the wind and the sea
neither God nor Sullivan

1504
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,710
can set this thing down tonight
like an egg crate.

1505
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:48,719
We might just as well slam
into a mountain. Dan knows it. I know it.

1506
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,068
And so does Sullivan.

1507
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:58,919
Wilby, check your final position.
I'm going to take her down.

1508
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,553
- Wait a few more minutes.
- Do as I say.

1509
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:02,033
- But it looks like...
- Do as I say.

1510
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,388
Give him a few more minutes.

1511
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,750
I've already waited too long.
Here we go.

1512
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:09,714
No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself,
you yellow...

1513
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:19,357
420 is losing altitude, sir.

1514
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:21,152
420, from Coast Guard.

1515
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:24,597
Radar reports you're descending.
Are you going to ditch?

1516
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:30,550
You are now below the minimum legal
altitude for approaching the coast.

1517
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:33,478
Time's wasting.
You better climb or settle for the drink.

1518
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:36,672
We're right with you. We'll follow you
down. Advise immediately.

1519
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:41,235
420 to Coast Guard.

1520
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,680
We've been too busy to answer.
Stand by.

1521
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:47,356
We may have a change in plans.

1522
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,399
<i>Thirty minutes of fuel left.
Cross-feed problem.</i>

1523
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,157
<i>Throw the rule book away.</i>

1524
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,358
<i>Highest obstruction, 1,950 feet,</i>

1525
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,789
<i>so 2,200 will be safe.</i>

1526
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:14,630
<i>Leonard, stand by electric altimeter,
call out readings.</i>

1527
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:17,035
<i>Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.</i>

1528
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:19,754
<i>More efficient use of fuel against time.</i>

1529
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:21,792
<i>Study approach book.</i>

1530
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,675
<i>Air Traffic Control to clear area.</i>

1531
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,195
<i>Direction finders on range station.</i>

1532
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,753
<i>Start right now.</i>

1533
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:33,509
Dan?

1534
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,349
Yeah?

1535
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:37,395
Thanks.

1536
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:41,113
Thanks for knocking some sense
into my head.

1537
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,399
- Someday I'll explain.
- You don't have to.

1538
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:49,588
We're not going to ditch.
We'll make San Francisco the hard way.

1539
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:52,239
Any change in the wind, Lennie?

1540
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:53,998
We picked up three of those
11 minutes.

1541
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:56,953
Bring me the approach chart
for San Francisco.

1542
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:02,757
Whistle me a tune, Dan.

1543
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,831
I like music while I work.

1544
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:22,355
- Can I get you something, Mr Briscoe?
- Yes. A ham sandwich.

1545
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:26,115
I can't. Everything went overboard.
Now you put on that vest.

1546
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:27,554
Great service.

1547
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:30,877
You throw all the food to the sharks,
so you won't have to serve it.

1548
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,316
Tell you what. Proposition.

1549
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,792
I think Miss Chen will let me
buy her a steak in San Francisco,

1550
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,956
if you come along, too.

1551
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,594
If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.

1552
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,634
Mr Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.

1553
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,875
- Take a breather, Dan.
- Okay.

1554
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,078
The Farallon Islands, any minute now.

1555
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,195
- Don't go any lower.
- No. I'll hold this altitude.

1556
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,959
Get back and call out our altitude
on the radio altimeter.

1557
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,958
We'll make straight for the
northwest leg of San Francisco range.

1558
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,674
The area's been cleared
and we're practically on the ground.

1559
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:17,870
I like the way you said that.

1560
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,278
Twenty-eight miles to go.
He's made first base.

1561
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,119
But if that guy runs out of fuel
between here and the airport,

1562
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:36,117
I don't know where he'll put
that thing down

1563
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,753
except in the middle of Market Street.

1564
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,998
Shut that thing off.

1565
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,429
Well?

1566
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:04,868
I'm going over to the terminal.
If needed, I'll be in the control tower.

1567
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,152
This is it. Ten minutes.

1568
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,837
Come on, let's make a final check.

1569
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:54,869
Inflate your vest, please.

1570
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,956
- We're going down?
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

1571
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:59,913
Take your time coming back to the door.
Wait until I yell.

1572
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:03,396
- Coast Guard plane still with us?
- Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.

1573
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,078
Put out your cigarette, please.

1574
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:08,272
Inflate your vest, Mr Childs.
You too, Miss Holst.

1575
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:13,196
- Some brassiere.
- Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.

1576
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,432
I really ought to take my briefcase.

1577
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:18,028
Sorry, nothing doing.
Inflate your vest, please.

1578
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:23,995
I can't.

1579
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,879
I'm terrified.

1580
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:28,512
I can't seem to move.

1581
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:35,517
Don't worry. Good luck.

1582
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:41,110
- All set, you two?
- We're still hungry.

1583
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:44,152
Our steak date is postponed.
Inflate your vest, please.

1584
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:50,753
Maybe you should keep this.

1585
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,917
I'd loved thinking it was mine,
even if it was just for a few hours.

1586
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:56,270
Nonsense.
You can keep it as dry as I can.

1587
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,516
If it's still working tomorrow night
at 7:00,

1588
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:01,712
take a cab to Ernie's restaurant
on Montgomery street.

1589
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,354
If it isn't working, come anyway.

1590
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:05,915
Thanks.

1591
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,795
We got them all to blow up, see?

1592
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,151
Good work. Remember take your time
coming back to the door.

1593
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,629
You want?

1594
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,916
No, thanks. Thanks just the same.

1595
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:19,635
If anything happens to me,
get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.

1596
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,911
- Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken.
- You tell her yourself, mister.

1597
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:26,715
You'll be all right. I'm not worrying and
I'll be the last guy off this aeroplane.

1598
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:29,400
- Do you have to be?
- That's what I get paid for.

1599
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,030
- Seat belt tight?
- I think so.

1600
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,833
This is for real, isn't it?

1601
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:38,554
I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.

1602
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:45,556
Well, even I might float.

1603
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,431
Inflate your vest, please.

1604
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,872
I don't want to die.

1605
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,231
Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.

1606
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:14,116
Give her two of these when you can.
They'll quiet her.

1607
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:46,317
Stand by for anything. Sullivan is gonna
try and make San Francisco.

1608
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:47,634
- Can we?
- I don't see how.

1609
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:50,399
Technically, we're out of fuel right now.

1610
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,793
We've bought it.

1611
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,117
550 feet, Skipper.
The coast hills must be coming up.

1612
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:13,071
- Watch it!
-400, a little less.

1613
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,349
Hang on!

1614
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,195
330.

1615
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:19,629
250.

1616
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,234
Ground's coming up fast!

1617
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:26,998
200, Skipper. This ain't good.

1618
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:30,909
180.

1619
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:40,112
420, from Coast Guard.

1620
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:42,829
Twin Peaks coming up on your left
in a minute or so.

1621
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,394
Remember those radio towers.
Stay on course.

1622
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,512
Don't descend anymore.

1623
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:49,871
Thanks. We're trying not to.

1624
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:52,558
150 feet, Skipper!

1625
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:29,589
300 feet, Skipper.
We must be past the hills.

1626
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:37,509
400.

1627
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:42,798
500. We're living!

1628
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:55,719
420, this is San Francisco Towers.
Special weather.

1629
02:09:56,120 --> 02:10:00,352
Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.
Wind, west northwest.

1630
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:02,756
Twenty to 25. Over.

1631
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:07,314
Okay, San Francisco Tower.
We'll make an ILS approach.

1632
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,234
Turn the runway lights up full blast.

1633
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:05,354
- Cone of silence.
- Right with you, chum.

1634
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,597
- We're cleared straight on down.
- This is going to be a fast one.

1635
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,950
Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.

1636
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,190
Get the outer marker, Dan.

1637
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:21,031
Outer marker identified.
But we're way below our glide path,

1638
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:22,309
so watch it, chum.

1639
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:25,034
There's a 690-foot radio tower
around here someplace.

1640
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,993
Has to be behind us,
we're right on the approach leg.

1641
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,795
Let me know it when they're clear.

1642
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,195
Feather it, Dan! Quick!
No time to fool with it.

1643
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:01,629
Give me full power on the other two.

1644
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:06,111
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

1645
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:31,793
- Contact yet?
- No.

1646
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:38,596
- This is a sweater.
- You're doing fine.

1647
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:42,712
When we pass the inner marker,
I'm shoving her down regardless.

1648
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:43,829
Yeah.

1649
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:50,955
Approach lights dead ahead.
Maybe a mile.

1650
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,593
Give her the gear.

1651
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,238
Three green lights and pressure.

1652
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:03,392
We can only stay in the air
another 30 seconds.

1653
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:06,639
- Full flaps.
- Full flaps.

1654
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:21,034
Now I lay me down to sleep.

1655
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:20,074
Did you get hurt?
Was anyone hurt at all?

1656
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:33,514
Two more coming down now.

1657
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:35,039
There's Mr Pardee,
the famous producer.

1658
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,151
He'll give us some information.

1659
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:42,958
- You're Gustave Pardee, aren't you?
- I was. I'm not so sure now.

1660
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,991
Please leave us alone. We're very tired.

1661
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,712
Give us a few words about your flight.

1662
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:48,671
I couldn't tell you.
Not in a million words.

1663
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,236
- What will your next production be?
- It will take a little longer than usual.

1664
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,918
- Next year, I hope.
- Next year?

1665
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:55,359
Now, please let us pass.

1666
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:06,869
Sally!

1667
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,834
Who are you?

1668
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,673
Miss, just one statement.

1669
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,920
- Tell us who you are.
- What's your name?

1670
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:37,832
- Why, it's a boy!
- Little boy.

1671
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:41,032
He'll sure have a story
to tell his grandkids.

1672
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:54,189
- Daddy wants you to come and see him.
- I will, darling. I will!

1673
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:59,070
Look at my space material.

1674
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:07,068
- Here he is. Who's that?
- Give us a statement.

1675
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:12,238
Where's the nearest telephone?
I have to call Honolulu, my wife.

1676
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:13,554
- Over there.
- Thanks.

1677
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:15,079
No questions, please.

1678
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,599
What happened?

1679
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,916
Here she is.

1680
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:22,115
Hold it right there. Thank you.

1681
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:23,912
She must be in show business.

1682
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:25,951
She's in show business, all right.

1683
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,592
She's the star of the Follies!

1684
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:34,753
Tell us your story.

1685
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:37,359
Just one.

1686
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:50,280
Papa!

1687
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:55,272
Just a moment.

1688
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:00,875
Listen, boys. I'm just a fisherman.
I want to see my kids.

1689
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:17,470
Thirty gallons, Mr Garfield.
That's all there was left in all the tanks.

1690
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:19,636
Too little to really measure.

1691
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:26,274
Tell this man we must have
reservations on the plane,

1692
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:27,515
first thing tomorrow morning.

1693
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:30,552
We'll miss Elvira's party.
It's important to you.

1694
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:32,830
What's Elvira's party
got to do with sled dogs?

1695
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,871
Really, darling. Don't be tiresome.

1696
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:38,788
We might as well play safe until you find
out how things are going to turn out.

1697
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,433
All right, Lydia.

1698
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:22,314
Hello, Pete.

1699
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:25,792
Meet us out front.
We're going for our steaks.

1700
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:31,791
Ten minutes, Mr Briscoe,
I'll be there for sure.

1701
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,038
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr Garfield.

1702
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:26,113
- I think your wife's waiting for you.
- Yeah.

1703
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,549
I don't want to keep her
standing too long. We're expecting.

1704
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:33,872
When you get rested, call me.
We'll have a talk.

1705
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:36,430
Yeah, sure.

1706
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:42,514
Good night.

1707
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:44,914
Good night.

1708
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:50,157
Good night, Mr Garfield.

1709
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,915
- Souvenir?
- For my wife.

1710
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:01,513
I guess the rain won't hurt it,
better get it home though.

1711
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:03,915
Susie will be waiting. Good night.

1712
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,436
Well, I guess I better get going.
Little past my bedtime.

1713
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:21,631
You had 30 gallons left.

1714
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:24,635
Yeah.

1715
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:28,429
Good night. We'll get together soon.

1716
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:30,954
Sure, chum.

1717
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:44,434
So long.

1718
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:49,278
So long, you ancient pelican.
