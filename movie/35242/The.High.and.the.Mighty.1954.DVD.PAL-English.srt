1
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,634
Hey, fella.

2
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,318
Ain't you Dan Roman?

3
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,275
Yeah.

4
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,756
I heard you whistling
and I said to myself,

5
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,791
only one guy does that just so.

6
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,155
I'd know that
ugly face of yours anywhere.

7
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,838
But you don't remember me, I bet you.

8
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,598
Sure I do. Ben Sneed.

9
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,432
I thought you'd be milking cows
somewhere on your own...

10
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,270
I mean, I thought you'd quit flying.

11
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,954
I thought you'd stay away
from these things.

12
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,949
They're only a hunk of metal.
They don't go no place in particular.

13
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
I guess I just haven't got
much willpower, Ben.

14
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,633
-What are you up to?
-Crew chiefing with Far East.

15
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,234
It's a good job.

16
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,515
I gotta go, Dan.

17
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,792
-I just thought I'd say hello.
-Sure. Good luck.

18
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,755
-Either one of you know that man?
-Sure looks old for a copilot.

19
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,270
-Didn't know we were so hard up.
-He weren't always a copilot.

20
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,830
We used to call him "Whistling Dan."

21
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,310
One of the finest men you'd ever know.

22
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,389
And the most miserable. He was
down in Colombia same time I was.

23
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,274
He's taking off one night
with a full load

24
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,356
and one of them South American
line squalls

25
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,550
decided to hit the field at the same time.

26
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,070
The wind shifts too late for him to stop
and he don't quite make it over

27
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,713
a little hill at the end of the field.

28
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,796
I remember that one.
Right after the war, right?

29
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,310
Yeah. Dan hits flap,
but the ship breaks in half

30
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,635
and there's nothing but fire
in 10 seconds.

31
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,716
Dan gets tossed
through the cockpit window

32
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,798
and only gets a few scratches
plus that game leg of his.

33
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,988
Which leaves him alive to blame
himself. Everybody else gets killed.

34
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,875
Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,956
It don't work out quite that way.

36
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,915
I knew two of the passengers.
They were off to the coast for a holiday.

37
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,108
Blonde girl, name of Mary
and a little boy, name of Tony.

38
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,670
Everybody thought
they were wonderful people,

39
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,199
including Dan Roman.

40
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,759
Mary was Dan's wife
and little Tony was his only kid.

41
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,909
Yup.

42
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,918
Dan is the only guy I ever knew who
had guts enough not to commit suicide.

43
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,111
Flight 21 now arriving,
Gate 1, from Los Angeles.

44
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,509
Miss Betty Emsley,
please report to the information desk.

45
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,033
Nice to have you with us, Mr. Flaherty.
Please check with immigration now.

46
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,236
You'll board in about 30 minutes.

47
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,070
This is Miss Spalding, your stewardess.

48
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,113
-I'll be in the bar.
-We'll call you, Mr. Flaherty.

49
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,469
Trouble.

50
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,435
-Mr. and Mrs. Joseph?
-Yes, sirree.

51
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,075
The Waikiki kids. Just put us down
as a float for the Rose Bowl parade.

52
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,714
-Your age, Mr. Joseph?
-Today?

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,877
No, I'm 38, so help me.

54
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,192
-Birthplace?
-Passaic, New Jersey.

55
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,914
That's the Garden State.
Motto. Liberty and prosperity.

56
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,270
Bounded on the north by New York,
on the south by...

57
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,439
-And Mrs. Joseph?
-Shall I tell him? I'm 33,

58
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,956
and I was born in Ogden, Utah.

59
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,228
Thank you, immensely.

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,435
Aloha.

61
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,877
-Hey, look. Remember?
-Yeah.

62
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,355
My name is Sally McKee.
I'm 30 years old.

63
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,236
I was born in Riverside, California.

64
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,711
-You're still a United States citizen?
-Yes, of course.

65
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,117
Thank you, Miss McKee.
Please check with immigration.

66
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,551
Your flight will be announced.

67
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,755
She may be put together
with paste and flour,

68
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,713
but that woman has something.
What would you say it was?

69
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
Practice. Plenty of practice.

70
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,958
-Aren't you...
-Yes, I'm Gustave Pardee.

71
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,752
I've enjoyed your New York shows
very much.

72
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,949
Good. Delighted.

73
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,274
Here are our tickets.

74
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,119
I'm 47 and I was born in New York City.

75
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,714
Mrs. Pardee?

76
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,515
I'm 30,
and I was born in Owosso, Michigan.

77
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,998
-How will the weather be?
-Fine, Mr. Pardee.

78
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,076
You should have a very pleasant trip.

79
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,718
He looks like a tired walrus on a rock.

80
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,435
She looks like she's done all right
for a slender redhead from Owosso.

81
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,030
-Ken Childs, 53. Born in Philadelphia.
-Yes, Mr. Childs.

82
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,197
I don't know where my luggage is. The
Royal was supposed to send it down.

83
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,673
We'll check right into it, sir.

84
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,075
May I introduce your stewardess,
Miss Spalding.

85
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,758
Hello, sister. New here, aren't you?

86
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,791
Four months now with the company,
Mr. Childs.

87
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,310
Good. I don't know where they get
some of the girls

88
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,432
but things are improving.

89
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,752
One of the few men who has ever made
any real money out of aviation.

90
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,599
He's one of our stockholders.
Treat him accordingly.

91
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,834
If you please.

92
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,398
-Dorothy Chen?
-Yes.

93
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,474
-Born in Antung, Manchuria?
-Yes, but I am Korean.

94
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,195
You have your passport handy,
of course.

95
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,879
Please take it to immigration.
It's just over there.

96
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,356
It's a real pleasure
to have you with us, Miss Chen.

97
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,674
Thank you, sir.

98
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,479
-That face.
-A moon and a willow tree.

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,037
West Airlines,
Flight 7 from San Francisco,

100
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,718
now arriving, Gate 11.

101
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,395
I'm sorry I'm late, Skipper. I got hung up
buying a present for my wife.

102
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,075
Susie will sure be excited
when she sees this.

103
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,389
Yeah.

104
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,875
I already been up to Weather.
The winds aren't too bad.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,149
Let's try 9,000 for a change.

106
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,271
I'll have a flight plan
in 15 minutes, Skipper.

107
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,311
I hope Susie likes this tray.

108
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,751
3,050 gallons be all right
for takeoff, Captain?

109
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,348
Sounds all right,
let's see what Leonard says.

110
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,716
It looks about 12 hours and 16 minutes,

111
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,432
if these winds
are anywhere near correct.

112
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,437
Okay, 30-50 takeoff.

113
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,552
West Airlines,
Flight 7 from San Francisco

114
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,432
now arriving, Gate 11.

115
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,199
Say, Skipper, how old would you say
Dan Roman is?

116
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,833
He was flying planes before I was born.
Look at it yourself.

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,988
He flew the airmail
in the open-cockpit days.

118
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,714
I think he learned to fly
in the first World War.

119
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,032
And endurance flights, racing,
old-time barnstorming.

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,470
Ten or 15 years with Transworld.

121
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,590
In the second World War, he flew
a bomber in the Ploiesti oilfield raid.

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,795
He took his cracks at Germany
in B-17s,

123
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,272
finally wound up with a B-29 squad
into Okinawa.

124
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,358
I'll just lay you a bet
he's got better than 20,000 hours.

125
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,790
-It sure is embarrassing.
-What's embarrassing?

126
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,396
He's got so much time and all.

127
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,831
They must've been out of their heads
to hire an old fire-horse like him.

128
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,076
Why not let him graze in the pasture?

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,800
-All ready, Lennie?
-All set to sign, Skipper.

130
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,199
-All ready, Lennie?
-All set to sign, Skipper.

131
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,594
Attention, please.

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,037
Mrs. Helen Bell,
please report to the ticket office.

133
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,988
Me, too.

134
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,714
Twenty-one souls onboard.
The rest, cargo.

135
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,837
73,000 pounds gross.

136
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,355
I said it to Orville, I said it to Wilbur,
and I say it to you,

137
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,630
the thing will never leave the ground.

138
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,156
You may rely on Miss Spalding to take
good care of your son, Mr. Fields.

139
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,840
He's not the first young man
to cross the ocean alone.

140
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,916
It will be quite an adventure for him.

141
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,759
He's, unfortunately,
quite an experienced traveler.

142
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,472
His mother will meet him
in San Francisco.

143
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,194
She's brunette, and quite beautiful.

144
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,833
If you'll wait at Gate 4, Mr. Fields,
you may put Tobey aboard yourself.

145
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,473
Thank you.

146
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,478
Come on, Tobey, let's go.

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,913
Flight 1-4 from Los Angeles
arriving, Gate 11.

148
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,595
What are you looking at?

149
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,948
Attention, please.

150
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,600
You suppose it'll ever happen to me?

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but where can I send a cable?

152
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,432
Just across from the souvenir stand.

153
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,949
You're sure about our connecting
with that New York plane?

154
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,469
You'll make it with time to spare,
Mr. Rice.

155
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,716
We'll make it with time to spare.

156
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,429
That little lady had a grandfather
who left her both brains and riches.

157
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,358
She bought her husband
an advertising agency not long ago

158
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,993
because he wanted a new toy.

159
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,473
How do you know these things?

160
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,875
I used to be a night clerk
in a Nevada hotel.

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,594
Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.

162
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,190
-Mr. Locota?
-Yeah, that's me.

163
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,634
I'm a fisherman.

164
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,558
My family should be in fishermen
for a couple of hundred years,

165
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,272
maybe more, I don't know.

166
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,635
The fish, they don't school up here,

167
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,591
like on the coast of California.

168
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,995
So, I'm gonna go back
to San Francisco now.

169
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,155
Thank you, Mr. Locota.

170
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,271
Your plane will be announced
in a few minutes.

171
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,755
Don't you want us
to check that through for you?

172
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,475
But I got in here my things
for to eat for the trip.

173
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,160
You've hurt my feelings, Mr. Locota.

174
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,351
Did you think you wouldn't eat my lunch,

175
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,152
or the steak we're gonna have
for dinner?

176
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,556
Ma'am, miss,
I don't know about these things.

177
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,799
I never fly before. I don't want to make
no trouble for nobody.

178
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,150
Serving you will be a pleasure,
Mr. Locota.

179
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,599
Thank you.

180
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,390
Just a minute, Mr. Locota.
There you are.

181
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,518
Thank you. Excuse me very much.

182
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,517
You didn't know all about that little man.

183
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,518
The ticketing sheet had nothing on him
except statistics.

184
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,790
I'm afraid he falls into
the "nobody" category.

185
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,310
He's gonna be more
than a statistic to me. I like him.

186
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh, brother.
Will I be glad to get on that plane.

187
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,798
Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?

188
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,356
Listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.
But this place,

189
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,871
Coney Island with coconuts.

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,470
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take all the Hawaiian Islands...

191
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,916
Tobey, will you tell your mother
something for me?

192
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,830
Tell your mother that there shouldn't be
an ocean between us.

193
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,028
Tell her I wish
she'd come with you next time.

194
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,479
-Can you remember all that, Tobey?
-Yes, Daddy.

195
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,672
I got him, Daddy. I got him.

196
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,672
-Everything okay, Dan?
-Yeah. Everything's fine.

197
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,476
3,050 aboard.

198
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,956
There's a slight oil leak, Number 4.
Nothing to worry about.

199
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,593
How long does it look like?

200
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,439
Lennie says 12 hours
and 15 minutes, about.

201
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,949
Twelve hours and 16 minutes exactly.

202
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,118
Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.

203
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,434
San Francisco.
I must go to San Francisco.

204
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,438
Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.
You're not on the list.

205
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,676
Mr. Kenneth Childs is on your plane,
isn't he?

206
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,028
Why, yes. Mr. Childs...

207
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,038
Then you must have room.
I insist. I must go.

208
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,353
Very well, sir. Fortunately
we have space available today

209
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,358
-if you're an American citizen.
-I am. I am for sure.

210
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,517
My name is Humphrey Agnew.
I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.

211
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,790
Right here in Honolulu.
Perhaps you've heard?

212
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,309
Yes. Do you have a travel card,
Mr. Agnew?

213
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,919
I pay cash for everything.

214
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,952
If you'll just step across the lobby
and check with immigration,

215
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,913
then come right back here,
we'll have your ticket ready, sir.

216
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,832
Now, there goes a real quack.

217
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,428
He's made a fortune
selling Agnew's aids to better living.

218
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,629
What have you got?

219
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,911
Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness,
sticky liver?

220
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,315
Agnew has got a curing pill
for all of them.

221
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,796
-So long, Alsop. Have fun.
-I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.

222
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,311
May I take your coat, Mrs. Pardee?

223
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,909
-You all right, Mr. Locota?
-Yes.

224
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,319
-We going to fly very high?
-7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir,

225
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,589
depends on our clearance.

226
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,188
Wouldn't you like to sit
next to the window, Mr. Briscoe?

227
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,835
You know something, miss? This is
as far as the old carcass would go.

228
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,269
I'd rather look at you
than what's outside, anyhow.

229
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,914
Your seat belt isn't fastened.
Shame on you.

230
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,880
My arm just won't bend around
the way it should.

231
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,672
-Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.
-I don't see any holes.

232
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,350
You know something, miss?
Neither do I.

233
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,194
Would you like me to take your leis,
put them in a cool place?

234
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,355
They'll keep better.

235
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,517
Now, that's just about the smartest idea
anybody ever had.

236
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,351
Gotta keep them as long as we can.

237
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,148
Gotta get back
to the old salt mines tomorrow.

238
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,277
Get the nose to the grindstone.

239
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,869
That's Hawaiian for "thank you."

240
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,271
Let me tell you something.
If we get into any trouble,

241
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,108
any serious trouble
that the pilot can't handle,

242
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,674
you just come to old Ed Joseph.

243
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,758
I'll be glad to go up there and help him
if he needs me.

244
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,279
-Got it?
-Got it.

245
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,518
All right, young man,
it's time to get you buckled down now.

246
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,836
Just make you nice and comfy here.

247
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,153
And the next thing you know
we'll be in the air, all right?

248
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,069
-Mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?
-I would be so pleased.

249
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,594
I am so happy
you wish to sit next to me,

250
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,476
because I have been watching you
walk down the aisle

251
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,355
and have the desire
to say a thing to you.

252
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,916
It is that you are
the first real, alive American girl

253
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,396
I have ever greeted in person.

254
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
You are so very beautiful.

255
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,838
I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one

256
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,510
if all the girls in America

257
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,038
are so beautiful and kind.

258
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,232
I don't think you're going to
have to worry about a thing.

259
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,629
Off.

260
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,432
-Wing flaps.
-Fifteen degrees.

261
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,152
-Mixture.
-Auto rich.

262
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,838
V1 and V2 speeds?

263
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,032
112, 116, that about does it.

264
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,116
-Check the radios, Dan?
-Yeah.

265
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,475
420 ready for takeoff.

266
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,075
Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.

267
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,476
When you have time, I wish you'd come
back and talk to one of my passengers.

268
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,635
All right.

269
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,228
He's a Mr. Pardee,
big rumpled-looking man,

270
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,873
sitting halfway back on the right side.

271
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,514
Alsop said he had something to do
with the New York theatre.

272
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,358
I suppose he wants to put you
on the stage.

273
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,152
Call me
if you need your honor defended.

274
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,669
And jump from the frying pan
into the fire?

275
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,711
He's the original frightened Freddie.

276
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,594
Every time you bank or change
propeller pitch, he goes all white.

277
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,995
Grabs on his seat
like it was an electric chair.

278
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,553
Okay.

279
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,358
I thought you were
going to quit smoking.

280
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,040
I did. I haven't smoked
in three hours and 20 minutes.

281
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,832
Go ahead, stain your teeth.

282
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,675
Come see me when you grow up, junior.

283
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,555
What in the world are you
bawling about?

284
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,110
Have I done something to bring this on?

285
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,516
-Nell, cut it out.
-I'm trying to.

286
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,478
I just can't.

287
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,119
It's just, it's all over.

288
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,472
What's over?

289
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,668
Our honeymoon.

290
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,320
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

291
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,799
Of course it does. It's not over
for another 12 hours or so.

292
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,273
And it never has to be
as far as I'm concerned.

293
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,353
Oh, Milo.

294
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,989
I'm scared.

295
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,914
I'm just plain scared.

296
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,430
What are you scared of? We've got
the whole world in front of us.

297
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,155
It's just that we're so young.

298
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,071
And just like you said,

299
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,915
we've got that whole big world
down there.

300
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,751
-And you know what?
-What?

301
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,471
We've got to face it.

302
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,876
I thought you had confidence in me.

303
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,232
Of course I do.

304
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,513
It's just that

305
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,837
all the rest of the people in the world
don't know you like I do.

306
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,754
Supposing I was going to have a baby
and you didn't have a job?

307
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,438
-You're not supposed...
-Suppose I was?

308
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,595
All right.

309
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,069
You're going to have a baby
and I haven't got a job,

310
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,555
there's no food in the apartment,
it's snowing outside,

311
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,955
and the sheriff's knocking on the door...

312
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,159
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

313
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,396
-Are you?
-Am I what?

314
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,834
Are you...

315
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,029
You know.

316
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,398
-Me?
-You.

317
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,716
Oh, Milo. No.

318
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,515
Whatever gave you such an idea?

319
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,359
I don't know.

320
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,998
Prof. Flaherty. Welcome.

321
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,471
Are we to believe
you are at last resolved

322
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,160
to abandon the arts
and return to science?

323
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,470
If so, we rejoice.

324
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,430
We have sorely missed your help
and advice.

325
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,796
You're doing all right.

326
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,350
You'll find out how to blow up the world
all by your little selves.

327
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,514
It won't be long now and blooie.
Congratulations.

328
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,357
Professor, we all appreciate the fact
that you've been under enormous strain.

329
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,677
We deeply regret
that a man of your caliber

330
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,155
no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.

331
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,349
Cooperate?

332
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,114
I had a seat on a nice little campus

333
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,192
even if I wasn't making much money,

334
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,073
or my students didn't know
what I was talking about.

335
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,157
And I played pretty good golf

336
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,597
and I slept nights.

337
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,958
I was happy because I figured
it was still God's business

338
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,116
to monkey around with the universe.

339
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,871
He can fix a star
so it'll burn for a billion years.

340
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,310
Keep going and you'll find out
how to burn one up in a minute.

341
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,917
Did any of you ever bother
to look at the lagoon out there?

342
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,638
It's beautiful and blue,

343
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,078
and the people around it
are brown and kind

344
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,709
and they did know
how to laugh and sing.

345
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,559
Only now all the fishes
in the lagoon are dead.

346
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,470
And the people are scared forever.

347
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,838
They don't sing anymore.

348
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,516
You found a way to blow out a window

349
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,598
65 miles away from the impact point.

350
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,188
Only, suppose there's a mother

351
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,959
standing in that window
with a baby in her arms?

352
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,279
Professor,

353
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,432
I suggest you go to your tent
and rest for a while.

354
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,991
I'll arrange transport back to the States
for you at the earliest possible moment.

355
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,798
Yeah, do that.

356
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,149
I want to find a shepherd in the hills
or a mountain in the mist,

357
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,398
and paint their picture

358
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,033
before it's too late.

359
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,192
So, you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

360
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,109
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

361
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,555
I've made almost 200 flights
across here

362
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,478
and I feel a lot safer
than if I were driving my car.

363
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,152
I've got a lovely wife and two kids,
another on the way.

364
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,669
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was safe.

365
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,598
You hedged, Captain.
You didn't answer my question.

366
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,675
Come now,

367
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,190
be a good honest fellow
and tell me exactly what frightened you?

368
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,508
They were technical incidents. I don't
think you'd understand, Mr. Pardee.

369
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,153
I understand perfectly.

370
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,715
For some reason,
you were afraid you wouldn't reach

371
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,592
your Biblical span of life.

372
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,518
Which is precisely what's bothering me
at the moment.

373
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,552
I'm convinced I couldn't swim
from here to the nearest shore.

374
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,477
You won't have to swim, Mr. Pardee.

375
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,875
Suppose one of your motors
ceases to function?

376
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,390
We'd just go back to Honolulu. These
ships fly beautifully on three engines.

377
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,795
If it should happen
beyond our point of no return

378
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,672
we'd simply continue
on to San Francisco.

379
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,076
Suppose two of your motors
became uninterested in further toil?

380
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,879
Each engine is entirely independent
of the other.

381
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,754
The chances of two quitting during the
same flight are one in several million.

382
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,075
Even if that should happen,
we could still fly,

383
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,156
lower and much slower,
but we'd get there.

384
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,478
You are very reassuring.
Why is it I read about so many crashes?

385
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,591
The newspapers always exaggerate
the importance of an air accident.

386
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,188
It would be very important to me
if I were in one.

387
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,912
You won't be, Mr. Pardee.

388
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,473
Just relax. Enjoy your flight.

389
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,236
Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you
for just a minute.

390
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,630
It can only be a minute,
then I'll have to go back to work.

391
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,872
I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.

392
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,560
I used to work in reservations
for Pan American.

393
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,197
That's fine. I'm glad you decided
to try a flight with us.

394
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,074
Aren't there two exits to this plane?
One up forward,

395
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,758
where you
and the rest of the crew leave?

396
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,995
Yes.

397
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,118
Could I leave the plane that way?
With you and the crew?

398
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,591
Please, it's very important to me.

399
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,350
It's not what you're thinking.
I am going to be met in San Francisco,

400
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,870
but not by the police or anybody else
who could get you into trouble.

401
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,797
It just wouldn't work.

402
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,233
Confused, Captain?

403
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,548
Why, no. That's you.

404
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,677
It was me, eight years ago.

405
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,315
A fellow in the States saw that picture.

406
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,269
He wrote me.

407
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,517
I was lonely, so I answered.

408
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,877
There were a lot of letters,

409
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,233
beautiful letters.

410
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,993
And then last month,
I agreed to marry him.

411
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,876
I never got around to telling him
the picture was eight years old.

412
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,833
I don't want to bore you
with my troubles,

413
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,276
but that dream kept me sane
for a long time.

414
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,228
I know I'm a

415
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,069
mess.

416
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,430
I'm so much older than he thinks I am.

417
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,594
But

418
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,956
if I could just see him

419
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,755
and then leave without meeting him.

420
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,718
Please understand, Captain.

421
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,389
What you're asking
is not exactly in my line.

422
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,112
Let me think it over. I'll let you know.

423
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,272
-Newspaper?
-No, thanks.

424
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,471
-How's AT&T?
-It's up a point.

425
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,557
I hope you don't mind,
I couldn't help watching you.

426
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,589
You remind me so much of a man
I once knew.

427
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,232
My name is Ken Childs
and I don't mind at all.

428
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,076
Fourteen minutes behind
on the last fix, Skipper.

429
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,235
So?

430
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,954
We should make it up.
The wind seems to be shifting around.

431
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,149
Good.

432
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,192
You know it's nice having
a guy like Dan Roman up here.

433
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,920
For a change,
I don't feel like a grandfather.

434
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,396
I was just saying to my wife
the other day,

435
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,112
I never had it so good.

436
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,436
Easy job, no strain,

437
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,799
and I'm pretty lucky in having
a girl like Susie.

438
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,670
It makes all the difference in the world
what kind of a wife a guy has.

439
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,518
Don't you think so, Skipper?

440
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,120
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

441
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,233
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

442
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,632
I guess a lot of people
do think it's funny,

443
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,394
because I do the dishes
and the cooking, too,

444
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,599
but they forget
how much younger Susie is than I am.

445
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,435
And as for an extra martini
once in a while...

446
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,313
And so you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

447
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,990
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

448
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,557
...it's spirit.
You know, she once called me...

449
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,874
Are you?

450
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,269
Are you now, for no reason at all...

451
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,710
You wait till you see what she does
with that hardwood tray I bought her.

452
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,115
...after almost 2 million miles...

453
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,197
...maybe beside the little bar
she bought...

454
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,355
...afraid?

455
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,198
...to keep herself company
while I'm away.

456
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,117
She'll show it to everyone
who drops in

457
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,958
to keep her company when I'm away.

458
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,399
But it's there.

459
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,357
It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.

460
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,878
You can almost touch it.

461
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,311
She spent most of her time
riding around in it

462
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,032
so she wouldn't get too lonesome.

463
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,319
Guess she drove a little too fast...

464
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,955
It's come like it has to so many others
for no reason at all...

465
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,269
And besides...

466
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,551
...except maybe the wear and tear
of those 2 million miles.

467
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,718
...because they look like they're going
faster than they really are.

468
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,752
Like what the bartender told me
last December

469
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,508
when she was picked up
for being drunk in and about...

470
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,710
They'll give you a certificate
for those 2 million miles

471
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,876
to hang on a wall at home.

472
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,071
Only, the certificate doesn't add up
to the wear and tear.

473
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,398
...but the wrong word.
It's spirit she's got.

474
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,313
Dan knows about it.

475
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,360
All the old timers say
it's only temporary,

476
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,679
like growing pains.

477
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,758
Like this note she left me
on my last trip.

478
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,112
And now, it's here for no reason at all,

479
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,152
and you've got to fight it,

480
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,509
all alone.

481
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,115
"Welcome home, fatso.

482
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,959
"Got sleepy and couldn't wait
so you take a taxi.

483
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,476
"Don't make any racket when you come
home banging around the kitchen,

484
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,876
"and don't wake me up
in the morning. Love, Susie."

485
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,439
What a sense of humor.

486
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,594
Someday, they're going to invent
a stool for navigators

487
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,518
that'll come somewhere near
fitting the human frame.

488
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,993
Ask Hobie if he can't synchronize
the props a little better.

489
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,236
I don't know
whether it's Number 1 or Number 3,

490
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,352
but one of them keeps slipping out.
It's getting on my nerves.

491
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,549
Okay.

492
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,392
Skipper says,
"What's the matter with you?

493
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,794
"Can't you keep the props together?"

494
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,239
They are together.

495
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,273
Skipper says they're out of phase.

496
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,356
One and 2 are as smooth as silk.

497
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,835
-So are 3 and 4.
-So be it.

498
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,349
The boys say the props
couldn't be smoother.

499
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,715
Yeah?

500
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,157
Well, there's something haywire.

501
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,277
Are you all right, Mr. Briscoe?

502
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,715
All right?

503
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,118
Little girl,
I'm getting along like $10 million.

504
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,073
Can I get you something?

505
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,589
Perhaps a cup of tea
would taste good to you.

506
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,639
-What was that?
-It's 5:00.

507
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,437
-You mean it chimes?
-You heard it.

508
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,594
Funny thing. It happens to be
the last possession

509
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,188
I haven't signed over to someone else.

510
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,631
I wish it would chime again.

511
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,360
What a wonderful way
to keep track of the time.

512
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,677
If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait
for the next hour to come,

513
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,949
and then the next one.

514
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,799
You know something?
I used to feel the same way.

515
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,276
But right now I'm in no hurry
for the hours to pass.

516
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,229
No, the watch is yours.
I want you to have it.

517
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,715
-I couldn't think of accepting it.
-Please.

518
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,400
A watch is the last thing
I'm going to need.

519
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,314
I'd like to think of it
marking the kind of hours

520
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,237
only a young girl can have,

521
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,674
exciting hours.

522
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,600
You'll make me very happy
if you'll accept it.

523
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,990
Well, if you put it that way.

524
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,079
I can't thank you.

525
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,832
I've never met anyone like you,

526
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,520
yet I shall remember you
for the rest of my life.

527
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,632
I'd rather you remember
it's only a possession

528
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,876
and so, not worth very much.

529
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,831
I will, always.

530
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,476
We can hear it chime together again,
it needs setting, you know.

531
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,115
-It's 7:00 in San Francisco.
-Sure. I forgot.

532
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,156
Is it really 7:00, little girl?

533
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,918
As far as this airplane is concerned.

534
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,032
Then you know something?
I don't want tea or coffee.

535
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,914
-A glass of water?
-Water is for bathing,

536
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,033
but if you can put some Scotch in it,
I'll feel cleaner.

537
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,195
Yes, sir.

538
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,231
-It's way past my cocktail time.
-Right now.

539
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,432
How about my friend over there?
Will you join me for a drink, mister?

540
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,074
Yes, thank you very much.

541
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,075
That's awful nice music.

542
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,151
We picked up four minutes, Skipper.

543
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,510
Looks like that wind
is finally swinging around now.

544
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,675
Good.

545
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,111
I may pass a miracle
and hit San Francisco right on time.

546
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,475
-Have a Lifesaver, Skipper?
-No, thanks.

547
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,516
Let me know, will you, when we pass
the point of no return?

548
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,829
Naturally.

549
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,273
Lydia, if you're through pouting,

550
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,438
maybe we could try talking things over
in a reasonable manner.

551
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,630
We have nothing to talk over.

552
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,638
Anyone who would sell
a New York advertising agency

553
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,149
-for a broken-down mine in Canada...
-It isn't broken.

554
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,317
...just to make yourself feel important,
the big operator.

555
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,914
Operating on my money.

556
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,510
I just want to get up with the feeling
that anything I accomplish that day

557
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,073
is due to my own efforts.

558
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,714
Not because my wife happened
to inherit a business.

559
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,593
In three years I should be able
to pay you back. Every penny.

560
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,030
Three years in the wilderness
and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin

561
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,311
with my skirts around my ankles
when they ought to be around my knees

562
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,476
or the other way around.

563
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,553
For the last time, Lydia,
I'm asking you to come with me.

564
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,911
I'm glad it's the last time you're going
to make that insane request

565
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,917
so I won't have to say no again.

566
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,509
I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.

567
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,959
You're out of your head.

568
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,196
What am I supposed to do
while you clump around

569
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,912
in your boots and lumberjack shirt?

570
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,999
Have cocktails with the chipmunks?
Play bridge with the Eskimos?

571
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,678
Go on off to your primeval forest.
Play Daniel Boone,

572
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,076
get up with the pigeons or whatever
kind of birds they have up there.

573
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,633
Get calluses on your hands.

574
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,274
Be a great
dirt-under-the-fingernails boy.

575
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,437
Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.

576
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,678
Take a bath Saturday nights
and go to an Eskimo hoedown.

577
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,472
Teach them to samba, for all I care.

578
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,876
Do just as you please
if it will make you feel like a man.

579
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,073
Only don't ask me to share
your juvenile adventures.

580
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,510
It's bad enough having to pay for them.

581
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,196
-Is that your last word?
-No.

582
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,595
I've always felt your brain
would fit nicely in a demitasse.

583
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,512
Hey, fella.
You got nothing but trouble, right?

584
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,671
-I assure you...
-I know what you're going to say,

585
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,950
everything with you is hunky-dory.

586
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,913
That's the first thing a fella
in trouble always says.

587
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,989
The booby hatches are full of people
that keep things to themselves,

588
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,156
either because they're scared
to tell them the truth,

589
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,874
thinking they'll make a monkey
out of themselves,

590
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,719
or they figure no one else can
appreciate the situation they're in.

591
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,640
Okay?

592
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,038
Okay?

593
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,078
Well, the Good Neighbors
believe that ain't so.

594
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,677
-And just who...
-A club I belong to back home.

595
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,799
It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.

596
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,312
Their luncheons are a riot.

597
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,916
Over the speaker's desk,
they've got a great big towel

598
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,635
with the letters "For Crying Out Loud"
embroidered on it.

599
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,719
And every member
has his own crying towel, get it?

600
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,999
When they bring in a bad case,
a couple of the Good Neighbors

601
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,510
hold the towel for the fella
so he can concentrate on weeping,

602
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,598
and then don't have to exert himself
in any other way.

603
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,038
It turns out to be a good
old-fashioned revival meeting

604
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,956
and the fella who has
no particular worries at the time,

605
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,953
he sort of feels left out of things.

606
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,716
And if this fella don't actually wind up
laughing at himself,

607
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,432
at least he feels better.

608
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,995
The main thing is, everybody does,

609
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,311
because nine times out of 10,

610
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,352
they think they're better off
than the other fella.

611
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,917
What do you sing at the end
of your meetings?

612
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,270
Pack Up Your Troubles
in Your Old Kit Bag?

613
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,628
How'd you guess?

614
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,469
When a fella comes in
with real trouble,

615
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,556
like he can't pay his income taxes,

616
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,433
or his wife just smashed up the car,

617
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,679
or his new house
shows cracks along the foundation,

618
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,199
they've got an organ that plays
real sad music.

619
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,959
It's a kick.

620
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,998
I can see how it might be.

621
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,277
Of course, a fella never comes in

622
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,478
with real troubles.

623
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,875
You know, like,

624
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,230
the guy's wife dying,

625
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,510
or his business really going broke.

626
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,155
They just confess little problems,

627
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,397
like who are they gonna get
to mow the lawn,

628
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,592
or will they ever break 100
on the golf course?

629
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,671
It's all relative, see.

630
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,789
You get the habit of laughing
at little problems

631
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,478
when they come along,

632
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,556
and then you don't blow your top

633
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,389
when the genuine,
serious things happen. Get it?

634
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,154
Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, Mr...

635
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,748
Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.

636
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,748
Getting back to your case,
maybe it'd make you feel better

637
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,518
if I cried some.

638
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,835
Then you'd understand
what the Good Neighbor means.

639
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,115
Imagine yourself with a towel.

640
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,589
Ready?

641
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,359
The wife and I scrimped
for over four years

642
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,198
to take a trip to Hawaii.

643
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,190
You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand,

644
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,872
things we ain't got at home.

645
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,795
We dreamed of the day
that we were to leave.

646
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,799
So, the wife persuades a woman
to take care of our children

647
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,478
for $10 a day,

648
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,593
which is more than I made
the first five years we were married.

649
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,998
We got all unpacked
and were really living,

650
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,877
but the ship don't sail.
Strike or something.

651
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,549
But all right, we're lucky. We get
the last two tickets on an airplane,

652
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,989
and although we can't take
all our luggage,

653
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,236
we're in the land of our dreams.

654
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,234
At the little hotel that fits our budget,

655
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,311
there's a mix-up in the reservations.

656
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,398
Another couple named Joseph
from Milwaukee.

657
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,557
So we figure
maybe they've had a dream, too.

658
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,716
So we don't start any arguments.

659
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,716
We finally wind up at a hotel
which is way beyond our budget.

660
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,512
So we have to cut our trip short.

661
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,036
Okay? Comes evening,

662
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,072
the wife gets into the one evening dress
she could bring along

663
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,078
and I get into a tux
I haven't had on in 10 years.

664
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,829
Mommy!

665
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,876
We were ready for the light fantastic.

666
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,598
The wife was wearing new shoes

667
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,553
with heels much higher
than she was used to and...

668
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,754
My back.

669
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,390
The house doctor says the wife
has twisted her sacroiliac,

670
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,074
which ends the dancing for the trip.

671
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,918
So everything passes.

672
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,715
In a couple of days the wife is well
enough to hobble down to the beach.

673
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,438
It rains bullfrogs for three straight days.

674
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,672
All we got to do is sit around
and write postcards back home

675
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,519
about what a wonderful time
we're having.

676
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,199
Three days we got left,
then we meet the Wilsons.

677
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,392
One of the pleasures of any trip
should be the people you meet, right?

678
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,159
The Wilsons had their own ideas
of what was fun.

679
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,319
He thought my wife was his dish,
and she thought I was Clark Gable.

680
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,878
The wife can't run very fast
on account of her sacroiliac.

681
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,592
I'm having my own track meet.

682
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,988
Fella, you have never lived

683
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,590
until you've been chased around
the palm tree by that guy's wife.

684
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,996
So we spend the rest of our dream trip
eating away from the hotel

685
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,999
so we don't run into these people
and have to play post office all the time.

686
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,274
But the last day the sun comes out.

687
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,790
Whoever heard of coming home
from a dream trip without a tan?

688
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,550
We're desperate, see?
We really soaked up that sun, all day.

689
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,798
The wife has a third-degree burn
on her shoulders.

690
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,512
I don't dare put any weight on my back.

691
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,796
I'm gonna have to borrow money
from the bank

692
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,469
to pay next month's food bill,
if we ever do get home.

693
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,159
If you still think you got troubles,
mister...

694
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,916
Wonder if you and Mrs. Joseph
would care to join me in a drink?

695
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,875
You can have your towel back now.

696
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,554
Take a breather, Dan.
I'll turn the knobs awhile.

697
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,433
Good, I could use a little shuteye.

698
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,350
Funny thing how a fella can sleep with
four big engines hollering in his ears,

699
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,034
only wake up when they stop hollering.

700
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,034
Imagine silence
waking you up at home?

701
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,191
No human being should have to put up
with such an arrangement.

702
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,833
San Francisco tollsman, 2930.

703
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,076
I don't care if you did build
that radio yourself.

704
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,428
It's against the law.

705
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,118
Throw it overboard before I do.

706
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,552
But I like to listen to the airplanes.
I spent a long time building that set.

707
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,596
You touch my set and I'll kill you.
I might do it anyway.

708
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,599
Just to have something happen
on this rust bucket.

709
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,678
You're going off your rocker.
You need six months ashore.

710
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,993
Being shipmates with you is enough
to drive anybody off their rocker.

711
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,599
Get out of here.

712
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,399
Don't say I didn't warn you.

713
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,158
The FCC will jerk your license
in a minute

714
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,510
if you send anything on that pile of junk.

715
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,789
Get out of here.

716
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,469
Hello, Honolulu.
This is 420 with a position report.

717
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,875
Come on, Honolulu. Wake up.
Answer him.

718
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,070
420, this is San Francisco,

719
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,873
Honolulu unable to read you
on account of poor conditions.

720
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,599
Go ahead with your report.

721
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,712
Okay, San Francisco. Copy, Honolulu.

722
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,956
Position at 0557.

723
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,116
Latitude 34/30 north.

724
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,030
Longitude 140 west, 9, 000 feet.

725
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,835
1, 500 gallons remaining.

726
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,391
From the window at my side,
sometimes I can see the stars.

727
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,636
America is all around me in every way.

728
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,949
Do you understand a funny thing?

729
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,078
In Honolulu, I must be inspected

730
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,954
by the American customs
and immigration persons.

731
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,273
And not one soldier to guard things.

732
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,117
I look everywhere for soldiers
with guns and...

733
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,431
Would you like your dinner now,
Miss Chen?

734
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,791
Yes. Please, I am so stupid.

735
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,593
Here is a letter to my brother in English

736
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,756
and I cannot remember this word.

737
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,274
It is that thing soldiers wear
at the end of their guns,

738
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,875
like a sword?

739
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,592
-Bayonet?
-Yes.

740
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,271
I am so very stupid. Thank you.

741
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,473
I am embarrassed.

742
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,034
Anyone who can write and read
more than one language

743
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,673
should never be embarrassed.

744
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,553
Being the original dumb-bunny,
I can barely write my own.

745
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,669
"Dumb-bunny"?

746
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,837
That's slang for mentally-retarded
American girls like me.

747
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,479
Dumb-bunny.

748
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,511
How delightful.
I must tell my brother of this.

749
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,634
You tell him you met the number one
stupid rabbit.

750
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,194
If he knows any American girls,
he'll understand.

751
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,912
Now I'll get your dinner.

752
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,433
Dumb-bunny.

753
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,435
There's something very wrong
back there. The tray...

754
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,198
-I know.
-A whole tray jumped.

755
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,073
-I burned myself.
-I swear it's that Number 1 engine.

756
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,552
It was running perfectly. They all are.

757
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,548
Maybe it's in the tail. If our little girl got
burned, maybe it's worse back there.

758
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,148
Dan, take your flashlight,
have a look through the tail.

759
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,157
-Report to me as soon as you can.
-Right.

760
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,952
Leonard, take a fast fix,

761
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,719
let me know our position now
and every 10 minutes from now.

762
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,353
Spalding, get back to your passengers.

763
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,835
If this thing lets go again,
they'll start wondering.

764
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,679
Hobie, tell San Francisco
we're experiencing

765
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,598
some unusual vibration
and to stand by until further advised.

766
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,950
Do you want to declare an emergency?

767
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,239
No, not yet.

768
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,880
-Is everything all right?
-We're still in one piece.

769
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,719
I was just starting to serve
the passengers. Should I go ahead?

770
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,159
You might as well.

771
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,748
Sometimes these things
never do get explained.

772
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,552
Say, hang up a minute, will you?

773
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,671
Tell me what's wrong
with this airplane.

774
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,712
-Is there something wrong with it?
-Cut it out.

775
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,832
Something popped so hard a while ago,
it spilled my drink.

776
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,080
Order another. We're not stingy.

777
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,713
You won't talk?

778
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,190
I would if there was anything to say.

779
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,275
I'll make you a bet right now,
we're late getting into San Francisco.

780
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,188
Could be.

781
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,353
-Did you find anything?
-Nope.

782
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,119
-What do you suppose it could it be?
-Beats me. Where are we?

783
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,071
I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.

784
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,633
Nothing wrong with the tail.

785
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,469
The Number 1 head temperature has
gone up five degrees in the past hour.

786
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,355
San Francisco wants to know
the nature of our trouble.

787
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,391
Tell them if we knew,
we'd have told them.

788
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,192
No, don't say that. Tell them...

789
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,515
Just say we still don't know
and to keep standing by.

790
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,916
I got news for you guys.
We just passed the point of no return.

791
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,114
-Have you lost something, Mr. Agnew?
-My lighter is out of fluid.

792
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,592
Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship

793
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
and is trying to work up an appetite
for dinner.

794
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,757
I seen a crazy man act like that once.
It ain't so nice.

795
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,632
He's looking for trouble.

796
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,394
You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?
Well, isn't that your name?

797
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,872
Yeah. Why?
I don't think we've met before.

798
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,958
No. We've not met
because no one wanted us to.

799
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,192
What can I do for you?

800
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,316
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

801
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,676
Well, does that mean anything to you?

802
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,154
-Agnew. You're Martha's husband.
-I am.

803
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,632
I didn't hear you say
you were pleased to meet me.

804
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,231
-Of course...
-Of course not!

805
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,190
Look, Mr. Agnew, this lady and I
are having a quiet drink together.

806
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,112
You seem to be disturbed
about something.

807
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,435
Perhaps we can talk later.
If you'll excuse...

808
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,950
No, you don't just snap your fingers
and send me on my way.

809
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,236
Mr. Agnew, I don't know what's
eating you, and frankly, I don't care.

810
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,272
Why don't you go back
wherever you came from and sit down.

811
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,119
-Now, honey.
-This man's a nuisance.

812
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,277
I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.

813
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,231
I must have been
an even greater nuisance

814
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,238
when you and my wife were scheming
to avoid me in Honolulu,

815
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,272
-so you could be alone.
-You're right out of your head.

816
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,590
I took your wife to lunch twice
because she was a very nice girl.

817
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,840
And a long time ago
she happened to work for me.

818
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,719
The worst crime she is guilty of
is shaking my hand.

819
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,316
Now stop insulting her
and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.

820
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,153
I knew you'd have
some fancy explanation.

821
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,630
But I'm not such a fool
as you and my wife think I am.

822
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,270
I'm going to let you wonder
what I'm going to do.

823
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,075
Wonder and think and think,
as I've been doing.

824
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,636
I've heard about you for years
and I'm sick of the sound of your name.

825
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,189
You're quite a conqueror
with the ladies, aren't you?

826
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,231
That should interest you, madam.

827
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,477
-I've had enough of this.
-What's the matter with you guys?

828
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,716
-Hey, what's this all about?
-Easy, break it up.

829
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,353
He's crazy, he's got a gun.

830
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,512
We're on fire!

831
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,118
-Pull the bottle on it.
-Hobie, pull the bottle quick!

832
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,870
-Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco.
-San Francisco 420.

833
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,472
The prop! The whole prop is gone.

834
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,158
Yes, and you may lose your engine, too.

835
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,794
-She's off her mountings.
-Pull the other bottle, Dan.

836
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,957
-I'm starting for the water.
-San Francisco 420.

837
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,955
Thank you, sweet Lord.

838
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,116
I don't think she's gonna burn any more.

839
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,798
I can't raise San Francisco. Static.

840
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,911
-Try the secondary frequency.
-I've tried both.

841
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,792
Use emergency.
Give them a mayday call.

842
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,399
-Are we going into the water?
-No.

843
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,476
She flies lousy
with that engine hanging down,

844
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,953
but I think we can stay in the air.

845
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,718
-How long to the coast?
-Six hours, about.

846
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,116
But at regular cruising speed. I've not
figured it out for this sort of thing.

847
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,355
Figure it!

848
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,549
...mayday 420.

849
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,155
Mayday 420, anybody.

850
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,678
I got somebody. A ship.

851
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,396
This is the Cristobal Trader calling 420.
I can hear you very clearly.

852
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,678
You passed right over me
about 20 minutes ago.

853
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,837
Do you want me to relay
all your messages? Over.

854
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,669
Roger. Advise San Francisco
we've lost Number 1 propeller.

855
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,637
Fire started but is now out.

856
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,075
We are now at 5,000, but sinking.

857
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,078
Request they clear
all altitudes below us. Over.

858
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,798
Will do. Stand by.

859
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,157
This is Cristobal Trader
calling San Francisco.

860
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,713
Clear sea rescue from Oakland Control.

861
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,115
Right.

862
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,275
Warm up the ready plane. Intercept.

863
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,598
San Francisco wants to know
if you are going to ditch. Over.

864
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,835
Negative for now.

865
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,599
What's the state of the sea
about you, just in case. Over.

866
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,110
Heavy northwest swells.
We are rolling about 30 degrees.

867
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,676
It's very rough.
Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.

868
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,149
It's wet down here. Over.

869
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,555
Thank you, Cristobal Trader. We'll try.

870
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,633
Attaboy, papa.

871
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,515
Some of these days, I'm gonna
get smart and go back to buttons.

872
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,596
-What's the poop?
-Eastbound lost a prop.

873
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,075
Had a fire but that's out.
Looks like he's headed for the drink.

874
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,997
-How far out is he?
-1,000 miles maybe.

875
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,473
My aching eyes!

876
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,239
This might well be my last show
and not a laugh in it.

877
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,955
I shouldn't have screamed,
but I was so scared.

878
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,674
My own heart is just returning
from the ceiling.

879
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,356
Troubles? Wait till I tell
the Good Neighbors about this.

880
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,796
I was almost asleep when someone
pulled the champagne cork.

881
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,319
This could become interesting.

882
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,034
Things were pretty interesting
before this happened.

883
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,798
Two apes were trying to kill each other.

884
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,275
Why don't you be a good boy
and go back and sit down.

885
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,118
I'm sure everything will be all right.

886
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,198
They'll come back from the flight deck
and explain in a minute.

887
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,392
I'm just gonna keep this for you
till we make San Francisco.

888
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,829
You can get in plenty trouble
with them things.

889
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,030
I'll get coffee for everyone.

890
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,952
Did you know space guns don't kill you?

891
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,069
No.

892
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,838
They just make you stiff.

893
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,955
You know, the funny part of all this,

894
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,356
is that for the first time
in my whole life, I'm innocent.

895
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,312
What I told him was the truth,
so help me.

896
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,514
This is gonna cost the taxpayers
a lot of money.

897
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,471
What would you have them do?
Swim home?

898
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,512
No Alameda, this is the Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Centre.

899
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,153
-New position, Skipper!
-Name it!

900
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,113
To the coast, 5 hours, 47 minutes,
if we can hold this air speed.

901
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,152
-How's our fuel?
-Enough. Just.

902
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,071
We'll only need about 1,150 gallons,
we've 1,300 according to my graph.

903
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,873
-It's pinching things close...
-You can throw your graph away.

904
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,798
-Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.
-How do you figure that?

905
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,959
The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons
when we lost our prop.

906
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,475
My guess is that when the prop left us,

907
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,909
it kicked holes in the wing.
Ruptured the tank.

908
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,953
We just can't make it this way.
I'll figure it up again, but the winds,

909
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,799
-maybe they'll change some.
-We're going into the drink.

910
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,911
It's just a question of when and where.

911
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,828
We've got plenty of time. Let's not rush
off into the heat of the day about this.

912
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,951
Let's hold on a while
and see what the wind does.

913
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,594
-We'll be closer to the coast.
-Water will be colder there.

914
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,918
And probably rougher, but I still think we
should stretch it out as long as we can.

915
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,155
I'll go along with you on that.

916
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,635
It'll give us more time
to get squared away.

917
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,479
I want you up here with me
when we really start down.

918
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,272
Meantime get everything
you can overboard.

919
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,119
Thousand pounds or so
will make a difference in our speed.

920
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,073
You want me to tell them
they're going into the drink?

921
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,232
Use your own judgment.

922
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,914
I guess I don't have to tell you people
that we've had a little trouble.

923
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,391
Maybe if I explain
exactly what has happened,

924
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,034
you'll feel better all around.

925
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,434
I'm not gonna minimize it,

926
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,394
nor will I make it any tougher
than it really is.

927
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,319
We've lost our Number 1 propeller.

928
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,711
This is just one of those things
that never happens but does

929
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,115
once in a billion flying miles.

930
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,154
We've extinguished the fire
with the carbon dioxide,

931
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,430
so there's no further danger from that.

932
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,552
But our speed has been considerably
slowed down

933
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,429
because the Number 1 motor
is partially twisted in its mountings,

934
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,517
causing a severe drag,

935
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,712
sort of like dragging your feet
in a rowboat.

936
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,431
I can't blame you
if you are a little scared, I am, too.

937
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,514
I've been flying since 1917

938
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,712
and I don't like this sort of thing
any better than you do.

939
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,469
However, with all that flying,
you'll notice that

940
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,636
I'm still very much alive.

941
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:47,977
Now comes the hard part.

942
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:51,531
-Can you take it?
-Please, tell us everything.

943
01:10:53,259 --> 01:10:54,977
I think we all want to know.

944
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:12,133
We're really very lucky.

945
01:11:12,259 --> 01:11:15,615
That propeller could have done
a great deal more damage.

946
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:20,771
Anyway, there are several holes in
the wing, that's where our fuel is stored.

947
01:11:21,299 --> 01:11:25,008
Which means that we can't quite make
the California coast.

948
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:28,977
Can't we go back to Honolulu?

949
01:11:29,099 --> 01:11:32,296
We'd already past the point
of no return when it happened.

950
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:35,217
We will probably have to ditch
this plane in the sea.

951
01:11:35,339 --> 01:11:37,899
We'll all be killed.

952
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:43,335
There's just a chance that you'll only be
in the water a few minutes.

953
01:11:43,459 --> 01:11:46,337
There's a rescue plane
already on its way to intercept us.

954
01:11:46,459 --> 01:11:49,974
Before we actually have to go in
there'll probably be several more.

955
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:51,976
Some of which can land on water.

956
01:11:52,259 --> 01:11:55,410
And surface vessels
will be directed toward us.

957
01:11:57,699 --> 01:12:01,294
Airplanes have gone
into the water before

958
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:05,054
and no one received the slightest injury,
except maybe a little dampening.

959
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:07,775
Casualties come from panic.

960
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:10,091
So you must not hurry.

961
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:14,212
Miss Spalding and our second officer,
Mr. Wheeler, will be back here with you.

962
01:12:14,339 --> 01:12:16,375
Do exactly as they tell you.

963
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:20,488
Airplanes have been known to float
for so long that

964
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:24,407
they became a menace to navigation
and had to be sunk by gunfire.

965
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:27,337
They've been known to sink
in a few minutes, too.

966
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:42,610
This is an inflatable life raft.

967
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:43,967
It's really a wonderful gadget.

968
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:46,329
It's got everything in it
but T-bone steaks.

969
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:48,536
It will hold all of you very comfortably.

970
01:12:48,659 --> 01:12:51,253
Mr. Wheeler, our second officer,
will be in charge.

971
01:12:51,379 --> 01:12:53,768
He will tell you
when to take off your shoes.

972
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:56,015
We don't want anybody kicking holes
in this raft.

973
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:59,176
Miss Spalding will show you
where the emergency rations are,

974
01:12:59,299 --> 01:13:00,334
when you get hungry.

975
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:03,656
How're we gonna get hungry if we're
only gonna be in the raft a few minutes?

976
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,497
Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?

977
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:08,497
Maybe a little,
but we just don't want bad things said

978
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:11,179
about the service
and cuisine on this airline.

979
01:13:11,299 --> 01:13:12,891
No doubt there'll be caviar.

980
01:13:13,019 --> 01:13:15,658
It would be most arduous
if there were no caviar.

981
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:17,889
I'll speak to the emergency chef.

982
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,975
I don't think
this is anything to joke about.

983
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:22,408
You're wrong.
The more jokes, the better.

984
01:13:22,579 --> 01:13:25,571
When you get in that raft,
you might even try singing.

985
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,935
I was once a fair-to-middling bass.

986
01:13:28,059 --> 01:13:31,210
I can't carry a tune in a basket,
but I'm sure loud.

987
01:13:32,139 --> 01:13:33,970
Now, this is very important.

988
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:36,818
When we actually go in,
there will be two shocks.

989
01:13:37,139 --> 01:13:39,972
If you know about them in advance,
they won't frighten you.

990
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:43,330
The first will be hardly noticeable,
like a normal landing.

991
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:46,491
But the second may be quite severe,
so brace yourselves.

992
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:48,776
Soon after that, the lights will go out,

993
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:51,936
but Miss Spalding and Mr. Wheeler
both have flashlights.

994
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,370
So unfasten your seat belts
and wait for his call.

995
01:13:55,579 --> 01:13:57,058
And keep calm.

996
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,808
Now, is there anything
you don't understand?

997
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:01,895
Could we send a radio message
to our families?

998
01:14:02,019 --> 01:14:04,931
They were gonna meet us at the airport.
They will be standing.

999
01:14:05,059 --> 01:14:07,334
I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy

1000
01:14:07,459 --> 01:14:10,178
giving our position
and contacting the rescue plane.

1001
01:14:10,299 --> 01:14:13,689
I've some important papers
in my briefcase, many years of work.

1002
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:15,377
Can I take them with me?

1003
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:17,814
Not unless you can stuff them
in your pockets.

1004
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:19,816
No baggage of any kind.

1005
01:14:20,299 --> 01:14:21,857
Come to think about it,

1006
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:24,618
the bottom of the sea
is the best place for them.

1007
01:14:25,979 --> 01:14:29,494
And one thing more.
Now, don't get your hopes up.

1008
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:33,335
There is one chance in a thousand
that we can make the coast.

1009
01:14:33,499 --> 01:14:36,536
This isn't possible unless there is
a marked change in the wind.

1010
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:39,492
And according to our forecast,
it just couldn't happen.

1011
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:43,612
But it could. And the one thing
we can do right now to help matters

1012
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:47,175
is to lighten ship.
That way we'll use slightly less fuel.

1013
01:14:48,139 --> 01:14:52,098
If any of you gentlemen have ever had
an urge to throw things out of windows,

1014
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:54,409
this is your chance of a lifetime.

1015
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:57,338
What about us girls?
I love to throw things.

1016
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:59,575
Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.

1017
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:05,773
I'd better stick with the wife. She's
awfully worried about our children.

1018
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:07,692
Please, let me help.

1019
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:10,937
I'll sue the airline for this,
I'm not supposed to exert myself.

1020
01:15:11,059 --> 01:15:14,495
-The doctor says my heart...
-Your heart is breaking my heart.

1021
01:15:14,899 --> 01:15:18,289
We can get rid of some of this baggage
if you gentlemen will come with me,

1022
01:15:18,419 --> 01:15:21,729
and the rest of you
form a line clear back to the door.

1023
01:16:20,099 --> 01:16:22,329
My new Mainbocher frock is in here.

1024
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:24,848
The insurance company
isn't gonna like this.

1025
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,098
What a wonderful excuse
to get a new wardrobe.

1026
01:17:52,659 --> 01:17:56,095
Be kind of nice
if he came through all this

1027
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:58,377
and didn't know a thing about it.

1028
01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:01,531
I need a big man.

1029
01:18:03,219 --> 01:18:04,208
Interested?

1030
01:18:04,339 --> 01:18:07,411
-Fascinated.
-Grab me around the waist.

1031
01:18:24,339 --> 01:18:27,012
All right, start kicking things out,
but be careful.

1032
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:31,367
Keep behind me,
it's lonesome out there.

1033
01:19:37,099 --> 01:19:38,532
That does it.

1034
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:46,050
Now all we have to do is wait.

1035
01:19:49,459 --> 01:19:50,687
Excuse me.

1036
01:20:02,259 --> 01:20:05,649
My kids, they like to hear me play this.

1037
01:20:45,059 --> 01:20:48,131
-Aren't you coming back to our seat?
-I'm staying here.

1038
01:20:48,259 --> 01:20:50,454
I can't stand that crying towel.

1039
01:21:53,059 --> 01:21:56,335
Hobie, give me 2,250 rpm.

1040
01:21:59,859 --> 01:22:02,578
Crack the cowl flaps.
Watch those head temperatures.

1041
01:22:07,819 --> 01:22:09,616
Give me another inch of boost!

1042
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:12,772
Look at the fuel, Skipper,
the flow meters, we're pouring it in.

1043
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:17,051
I can't help it. This turbulence is slowing
us down and we can't climb out of it!

1044
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:30,452
Have a cup of coffee.

1045
01:22:31,059 --> 01:22:34,290
-I'm plenty hot enough now.
-Then it will cool you off.

1046
01:22:43,339 --> 01:22:45,899
Of course you're worried, Mrs. Joseph.

1047
01:22:46,019 --> 01:22:48,817
But I'm quite certain
we'll get out of this all right.

1048
01:22:48,939 --> 01:22:52,488
By tomorrow we can look back on it
as an interesting experience.

1049
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:56,257
By the by, how old are your children?

1050
01:22:56,819 --> 01:23:00,095
Jennifer is six and Edward is four.

1051
01:23:00,219 --> 01:23:04,417
Jennifer is such a delightful name,
Mrs. Joseph. How fortunate you are.

1052
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:09,771
Jennifer has always brought to me
the suggestion of the Scottish moor,

1053
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:13,412
heather, great peace,

1054
01:23:13,899 --> 01:23:16,891
and visions of little villages
nestled against the hills.

1055
01:23:17,499 --> 01:23:19,171
That sort of thing.

1056
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,689
Is your Jennifer anything like that?

1057
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:26,218
I don't know exactly what you mean,
but she's always been a quiet child.

1058
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:27,454
Precisely.

1059
01:23:27,699 --> 01:23:30,657
Somehow I knew your Jennifer
would be like that.

1060
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:34,573
And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing
so fast you can't buy shoes for him.

1061
01:23:35,499 --> 01:23:37,057
Every three weeks.

1062
01:23:39,499 --> 01:23:41,615
Why don't you try to rest now?

1063
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:45,176
Later I'd like to hear
a great deal more about your children.

1064
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:57,134
I thought you hated
the mere mention of children.

1065
01:23:57,259 --> 01:23:58,487
I do.

1066
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:02,009
But that poor woman is terrified.
I think I helped her.

1067
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:06,649
For 10 years you've said that
love was a word in the dictionary

1068
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:08,770
and children were monsters.

1069
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:12,175
And you would never go two inches
out of your way to help anybody.

1070
01:24:12,299 --> 01:24:14,369
What goes, Gustave?

1071
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:19,736
I've never seen you this way.

1072
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:22,293
You've forgotten yourself
for a whole hour.

1073
01:24:22,419 --> 01:24:25,252
You've been magnificent.

1074
01:24:25,779 --> 01:24:28,498
Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence.

1075
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:32,491
You told that woman
we'd get out of this all right.

1076
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:34,496
-Do you really believe that?
-No.

1077
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:38,977
In spite of what that pilot said, I think
we're batting at a very sticky wicket.

1078
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:42,177
-And yet you're not afraid?
-Yes and no.

1079
01:24:42,859 --> 01:24:44,577
I'm not sure just how I feel.

1080
01:24:45,259 --> 01:24:48,729
If I were openly afraid now,
some of the others might become so.

1081
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:53,048
I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics
right after the fire

1082
01:24:53,179 --> 01:24:55,295
and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.

1083
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:58,495
I just want to know one thing.

1084
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:01,299
What happened to the biggest baby
in the world?

1085
01:25:01,699 --> 01:25:04,611
The child-man who was afraid to sleep
with the lights off.

1086
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:07,936
You used to burst into tears
if the laundry put starch in your shirts,

1087
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:10,129
or the crepe suzette was underdone.

1088
01:25:10,859 --> 01:25:15,091
I don't understand you, Gustave.
I guess I never will.

1089
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:18,927
Maybe it isn't important
to understand you

1090
01:25:20,459 --> 01:25:23,974
like the other women
you've always managed to keep around.

1091
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:30,417
I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain
with a throwback, a Roman emperor.

1092
01:25:32,139 --> 01:25:35,848
You bought me on the market, Gustave,
paid for me,

1093
01:25:35,979 --> 01:25:39,449
like you might pay for a play
which you thought might turn out well.

1094
01:25:41,739 --> 01:25:46,335
For 10 years I've lived with that thought
and hated it.

1095
01:25:48,459 --> 01:25:50,495
Now it'll never bother me again.

1096
01:25:57,859 --> 01:26:00,168
Gustave, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

1097
01:26:00,299 --> 01:26:04,895
And if we don't get out of this,
I'd like you to know it even more.

1098
01:26:06,379 --> 01:26:08,609
I've never said it before

1099
01:26:09,339 --> 01:26:11,978
and probably you'll never want me
to say it again.

1100
01:26:12,099 --> 01:26:14,772
What else is on your twisted little mind?

1101
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:20,891
I'm in love with you, Gustave.

1102
01:26:24,019 --> 01:26:26,249
I guess I always have been.

1103
01:26:35,619 --> 01:26:37,849
And then you tie the ribbons like this.

1104
01:26:38,619 --> 01:26:40,974
These preservers are not inflated now.

1105
01:26:41,339 --> 01:26:43,773
If you jerk this cord on either side,

1106
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:46,174
carbon dioxide will be released
from the capsules

1107
01:26:46,299 --> 01:26:48,130
and the vest will inflate immediately.

1108
01:26:48,259 --> 01:26:49,453
That's all there is to it.

1109
01:26:51,579 --> 01:26:54,139
-Any calls for me?
-Take your pick.

1110
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:56,971
Boyd, public relations.

1111
01:26:57,419 --> 01:27:00,138
No, Tommy.
We've not lost an airplane.

1112
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:03,769
I'm standing right here in Operations
and our plane is still in the air.

1113
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:07,414
Yeah, we had a little trouble. No,
I don't know the passengers' names.

1114
01:27:07,539 --> 01:27:09,370
Yeah, okay.

1115
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:12,616
Where's Garfield? This jerk newspaper
wants a statement from the manager.

1116
01:27:12,739 --> 01:27:15,048
He's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

1117
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:16,976
Boyd, public relations.

1118
01:27:17,339 --> 01:27:20,729
Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown
over 30 million passenger miles

1119
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:22,815
without ever scratching a passenger.

1120
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:24,611
Sure we want to cooperate.

1121
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,731
You'll get the straight dope,
just give me time to get organized.

1122
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:29,451
Goodbye.

1123
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,297
Mr. Garfield, can you give me a minute?

1124
01:27:31,419 --> 01:27:33,137
Just about. What's your trouble?

1125
01:27:33,259 --> 01:27:35,853
The papers are on my neck already.
What will I tell them?

1126
01:27:35,979 --> 01:27:37,856
How about "drop dead" for an opener?

1127
01:27:37,979 --> 01:27:40,618
-You know I can't do that.
-I know.

1128
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:43,333
-How long can you stall them?
-I don't know, maybe an hour.

1129
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,256
They're crying about morning editions.

1130
01:27:45,379 --> 01:27:48,052
An hour might be enough.
We've got real trouble.

1131
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:50,610
Does it look that bad?

1132
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,217
It don't look good.

1133
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:02,177
Is everything all right with you two?

1134
01:28:02,299 --> 01:28:05,735
I don't know when I've felt better
in the last five years.

1135
01:28:06,299 --> 01:28:10,656
I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl I
would most like to be on a life raft with.

1136
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:14,096
Of course, now,
she may prefer a younger man.

1137
01:28:15,019 --> 01:28:18,614
There is in my family a very old saying.

1138
01:28:26,339 --> 01:28:28,933
I will try to translate it for you.

1139
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:34,214
"The youth of man will never die

1140
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:36,895
"unless he murders it."

1141
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,731
I plead not guilty.

1142
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:43,532
I just want to show you
how to use your life vest.

1143
01:28:44,979 --> 01:28:46,810
My neck won't stand any weight,

1144
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:49,976
and my bones are only held together
by my imagination.

1145
01:28:50,099 --> 01:28:52,772
A burial at sea will save my heirs
a lot of money.

1146
01:28:53,299 --> 01:28:56,735
-I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.
-Why do that?

1147
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:59,697
You just look more comfortable
that way, Mr. Briscoe.

1148
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:03,575
You impress me
as the open-collar type anyway.

1149
01:29:04,059 --> 01:29:05,253
Rugged, you know.

1150
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:07,017
-Outdoorsy, you mean?
-Yes.

1151
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:09,012
You behave yourself.

1152
01:29:09,139 --> 01:29:12,017
I'll be coming back to make sure
you're being nice to Miss Chen.

1153
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:15,609
It's a rough assignment
for an outdoor man without his horse,

1154
01:29:15,739 --> 01:29:17,730
but I'll do my best.

1155
01:29:18,779 --> 01:29:21,009
Would you like
to put your vests on now?

1156
01:29:22,019 --> 01:29:26,092
Investigation will undoubtedly prove this
airplane was ready for the junk heap.

1157
01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:28,416
And we're in the hands of incompetents.

1158
01:29:28,539 --> 01:29:32,452
I don't want to make no trouble,
but why don't you shut up?

1159
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:33,898
You hate me, don't you?

1160
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:36,533
All of you hate me
because I tried to do what was right.

1161
01:29:36,659 --> 01:29:38,775
Do like the little lady says.

1162
01:29:38,899 --> 01:29:40,890
Don't touch me, please.

1163
01:29:41,019 --> 01:29:44,329
You're giving me a very bad time,
Mr. Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.

1164
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:45,574
I have a perfect right...

1165
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:48,691
You got no rights at all
for some time to come.

1166
01:29:49,099 --> 01:29:53,536
Do like she says or no life vest
is gonna keep you from drowning

1167
01:29:53,659 --> 01:29:57,368
because I'm gonna hold your head
under till you stop wiggling.

1168
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:03,935
If we should happen to go down,
I'll give you plenty of warning.

1169
01:30:04,059 --> 01:30:07,096
Cross your arms like this
right in front of your face.

1170
01:30:07,299 --> 01:30:09,859
Brace your hands
on the seat just ahead.

1171
01:30:10,219 --> 01:30:12,528
Bend your head down
between your arms,

1172
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:15,412
and keep them there
until we've stopped completely.

1173
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:17,577
Remember to remove your shoes.

1174
01:30:17,699 --> 01:30:19,735
You men should loosen
your collar and tie.

1175
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:21,212
Why?

1176
01:30:21,339 --> 01:30:23,216
According to the ditching instructions,

1177
01:30:23,339 --> 01:30:25,899
there is less possibility
of breaking your neck.

1178
01:30:37,019 --> 01:30:38,498
Anything from 420?

1179
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:40,856
Not a sound out of them, sir.

1180
01:30:42,379 --> 01:30:44,847
Those people,
if they have to ditch tonight

1181
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:47,413
with the way that wind's
kicking up that sea,

1182
01:30:47,939 --> 01:30:50,134
they don't stand much of a chance,
I'm thinking.

1183
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:02,496
Cristobal Trader from San Francisco.

1184
01:32:02,619 --> 01:32:05,850
We can work the aircraft clearly now.
Thanks for your help. Over.

1185
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,697
Good. Muchas gracias.

1186
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:11,768
Cristobal Trader over and out.

1187
01:32:41,339 --> 01:32:44,376
How about letting me take over
for a while? Save yourself for later.

1188
01:32:44,499 --> 01:32:46,171
-We'll need you.
-All right.

1189
01:32:54,059 --> 01:32:56,857
Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.

1190
01:32:56,979 --> 01:33:00,733
Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left. But if the
winds are right we can make it.

1191
01:33:01,099 --> 01:33:04,057
We picked up four minutes
in the past hour. I figured it all out.

1192
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:06,977
If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes,
we're safe.

1193
01:33:07,099 --> 01:33:09,533
Hey, Skipper,
the interceptor is calling us.

1194
01:33:11,979 --> 01:33:15,574
We estimate our position
at 145 miles east of you.

1195
01:33:15,819 --> 01:33:18,856
Expect interception
in approximately 20 minutes.

1196
01:33:19,019 --> 01:33:20,418
Get a bearing on him.

1197
01:33:24,059 --> 01:33:26,698
We will transmit every three minutes
from now on.

1198
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:30,334
When your needle begins to
fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.

1199
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:32,729
We will then be very close to you.

1200
01:33:33,579 --> 01:33:35,490
You should have a bearing by now.
How about it?

1201
01:33:42,139 --> 01:33:43,538
We're gonna make it.

1202
01:33:45,819 --> 01:33:49,368
Five degrees north of our course.
We're awful glad to know you're around.

1203
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:53,816
We know what you mean.
Say, can you guys climb any higher?

1204
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:56,368
Out of this stuff
interception would be a lot easier.

1205
01:33:56,499 --> 01:33:59,650
Negative. We can climb, but we don't
want to use the fuel to do it.

1206
01:33:59,779 --> 01:34:01,690
Every gallon's a mile nearer shore
for us.

1207
01:34:02,859 --> 01:34:04,577
Okay. We'll find you anyway.

1208
01:34:27,339 --> 01:34:30,297
-Are you still afraid?
-No, my darling.

1209
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:36,418
I don't mean the airplane.
I mean us, our future.

1210
01:34:37,419 --> 01:34:39,296
I'm not afraid of anything now.

1211
01:34:40,499 --> 01:34:41,852
I can't hear you.

1212
01:34:43,459 --> 01:34:46,690
How could I ever be afraid
when you hold me like this?

1213
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:50,611
-I love you.
-Darling.

1214
01:35:03,979 --> 01:35:04,968
No.

1215
01:35:07,939 --> 01:35:09,850
Just think where we are.

1216
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:12,288
I'm thinking how awful it would be

1217
01:35:12,419 --> 01:35:15,138
if this was the last time
I could hold you so.

1218
01:35:16,139 --> 01:35:20,371
-We'll have years, all our lives.
-If this airplane makes it.

1219
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:24,459
Careful, darling.

1220
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:33,808
Howard.

1221
01:35:44,019 --> 01:35:46,374
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

1222
01:35:48,139 --> 01:35:50,334
Would you be sorry if I drowned?

1223
01:35:51,299 --> 01:35:53,767
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I have to know.

1224
01:35:56,579 --> 01:35:58,376
I'd be more than sorry.

1225
01:35:59,659 --> 01:36:02,093
You could go off to your North woods.

1226
01:36:04,779 --> 01:36:07,691
It's occurred to me
that trying to make a go at that mine

1227
01:36:07,819 --> 01:36:10,094
might turn out to be a bad dream.

1228
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:13,298
But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.

1229
01:36:14,739 --> 01:36:15,808
It was.

1230
01:36:18,099 --> 01:36:21,614
I could switch things back.
I suppose that would please you.

1231
01:36:21,739 --> 01:36:23,491
I'd only lose you.

1232
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:28,651
A few hours ago,
you insisted on getting rid of me.

1233
01:36:33,179 --> 01:36:36,808
At times I'm a very stupid
and selfish woman.

1234
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:42,007
I think you should go up to your mine.

1235
01:36:42,579 --> 01:36:43,853
That's you.

1236
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:48,059
And you might take me along for laughs.

1237
01:36:48,939 --> 01:36:50,577
I'm hearing things.

1238
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,377
You'd be miserable.

1239
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:55,013
No doubt.

1240
01:36:56,299 --> 01:36:57,732
But I want you.

1241
01:36:58,459 --> 01:37:00,848
The guy I had sense enough to marry.

1242
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:07,370
If I choke on hotcakes, or try to put
evening gowns on the natives,

1243
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:13,138
or have cocktails with the sled dogs,
you'll just have to be patient with me.

1244
01:37:14,819 --> 01:37:17,413
You don't have to, but I wish you would.

1245
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:23,534
Mush! That's what you say
to a sled dog, isn't it?

1246
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:26,175
I want to start practicing.

1247
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:32,811
Makes them turn left,
if you yell it loud enough.

1248
01:37:35,499 --> 01:37:37,490
You're very good.

1249
01:37:41,779 --> 01:37:44,816
-Can you get that through to Sullivan?
-I can try.

1250
01:37:45,019 --> 01:37:47,533
-Everything else buttoned up?
-Yes, sir.

1251
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:53,575
-Any improvement in the local weather?
-I'm afraid not.

1252
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:13,258
-Radar, anything yet?
-No target, sir.

1253
01:38:14,059 --> 01:38:16,971
Navigator, how's our position
for interception?

1254
01:38:17,179 --> 01:38:19,295
Dead on. Just got a loran fix.

1255
01:38:20,299 --> 01:38:23,257
We should be joining now,
if their navigator is anywhere near right.

1256
01:38:34,459 --> 01:38:36,495
-Radar?
-No target, sir.

1257
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:39,617
-Somebody's wrong.
-We should be right on top of them.

1258
01:38:43,059 --> 01:38:44,208
We can easily miss this guy.

1259
01:38:46,339 --> 01:38:47,772
No target, sir.

1260
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:53,934
That navigator's wacky.
We're already seven minutes overdue.

1261
01:38:55,379 --> 01:38:56,448
Radar?

1262
01:38:57,419 --> 01:39:01,014
Target, Skipper. Strong blip.
Four degrees left, eight miles.

1263
01:39:01,419 --> 01:39:02,852
Looks like he's 500 feet below us.

1264
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:20,731
Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?

1265
01:39:21,659 --> 01:39:24,856
What happened to the 11 minutes
you were counting on?

1266
01:39:25,099 --> 01:39:27,169
What happened to them, fatso?

1267
01:39:27,579 --> 01:39:30,013
You never could make them up,
you just thought you could.

1268
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:35,008
-Lennie, what about it?
-Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.

1269
01:39:45,859 --> 01:39:48,248
Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.

1270
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:52,336
Find the minutes,
and you can come back to me.

1271
01:39:53,099 --> 01:39:54,817
Minutes.

1272
01:39:55,499 --> 01:39:57,296
Who's got the minutes?

1273
01:39:57,419 --> 01:39:59,853
Your Susie's got them, right here.

1274
01:40:02,499 --> 01:40:04,455
Come on, Lennie.
What's holding things up?

1275
01:40:04,579 --> 01:40:07,013
The Coast Guard says
your position's wrong.

1276
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:09,289
I'll be right with you, Skipper.

1277
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:19,013
Skipper?

1278
01:40:22,219 --> 01:40:23,652
I got bad news.

1279
01:40:25,099 --> 01:40:28,330
The Coast Guard was right.
I made a dumb kid's mistake.

1280
01:40:29,179 --> 01:40:32,455
We're not as close to the coast
as I thought we were.

1281
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:35,218
I was figuring in knots instead of miles.

1282
01:40:36,019 --> 01:40:37,975
I guess I was just scared.

1283
01:40:38,179 --> 01:40:39,851
What about those 11 minutes?

1284
01:40:39,979 --> 01:40:42,891
They can make the difference
between the water and your own bed.

1285
01:40:43,019 --> 01:40:44,532
They aren't there.

1286
01:40:45,499 --> 01:40:47,251
They never were there.

1287
01:40:48,379 --> 01:40:49,971
I'm sorry, Skipper.

1288
01:41:02,659 --> 01:41:04,456
I hope this will float.

1289
01:41:27,699 --> 01:41:30,372
I am so excited about your arrival,
Sally.

1290
01:41:30,699 --> 01:41:34,408
Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains
and pines, which will be your home, too,

1291
01:41:34,539 --> 01:41:38,054
and go down to the city
for my first visit in over a year.

1292
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:40,848
I want to get there
a few days before you arrive,

1293
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:43,254
because there are some things
this cabin needs

1294
01:41:43,379 --> 01:41:45,939
to make it more comfortable for a girl.

1295
01:41:48,339 --> 01:41:51,217
I'm still scared you won't like it up here,

1296
01:42:00,099 --> 01:42:03,330
unless you're nuts about
the sound of a mountain stream,

1297
01:42:03,459 --> 01:42:07,532
or love to watch the sun seem to turn
a mountain peak around very slow.

1298
01:42:12,299 --> 01:42:13,448
Hey, Henry.

1299
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:20,848
One of our neighbors
just came by to say hello.

1300
01:42:20,979 --> 01:42:22,935
A little fawn I call Henry.

1301
01:42:23,099 --> 01:42:26,330
He seems to ask,
"Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"

1302
01:42:26,459 --> 01:42:27,858
So hurry, girl!

1303
01:42:30,419 --> 01:42:32,728
So you'll be sure to recognize me
at the airport,

1304
01:42:32,859 --> 01:42:35,168
I'll be wearing a bright green tie.

1305
01:42:36,219 --> 01:42:38,574
P.S. I was just thinking how lucky I am.

1306
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:41,008
I happened to pick up
an old torn magazine

1307
01:42:41,139 --> 01:42:44,495
and there is your picture,
smacking me right between the eyes.

1308
01:42:44,619 --> 01:42:48,214
And only a short time later,
that very wonderful-looking little girl

1309
01:42:48,339 --> 01:42:50,295
is coming to share my life.

1310
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:15,013
Remarkable.

1311
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:18,251
What's so remarkable?

1312
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:21,617
Is it faith or just habit
that compels a woman

1313
01:43:21,739 --> 01:43:24,811
to put on fresh makeup
before boarding a life raft?

1314
01:43:25,259 --> 01:43:27,215
Aren't you jumping the gun?

1315
01:43:27,739 --> 01:43:30,776
You're being a fatalist
about this business then?

1316
01:43:33,179 --> 01:43:35,619
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1317
01:43:35,619 --> 01:43:35,971
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1318
01:43:36,499 --> 01:43:38,808
How can you sit there so calmly then,

1319
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:41,089
when a little while ago
you were terrified?

1320
01:43:41,779 --> 01:43:45,931
I sat down here with you because
I thought I might be able to help you.

1321
01:43:46,299 --> 01:43:47,891
But I'm not needed.

1322
01:43:49,819 --> 01:43:51,696
If you came over to give me help,

1323
01:43:51,819 --> 01:43:54,777
it was partly because
you needed help yourself,

1324
01:43:56,379 --> 01:43:57,607
very badly.

1325
01:44:00,419 --> 01:44:02,057
Don't worry about me.

1326
01:44:02,179 --> 01:44:04,534
I've just stopped worrying
about losing something

1327
01:44:04,659 --> 01:44:07,253
I never had a chance to get
in the first place.

1328
01:44:07,379 --> 01:44:10,735
Would the thing be a man?
Or am I getting too personal?

1329
01:44:11,539 --> 01:44:12,654
You are.

1330
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:14,651
I don't care anymore.

1331
01:44:15,739 --> 01:44:18,173
I've been kidding myself long enough.

1332
01:44:19,899 --> 01:44:22,049
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

1333
01:44:23,339 --> 01:44:25,216
What are you hiding from?

1334
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:28,854
Myself.

1335
01:44:31,379 --> 01:44:34,451
He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.

1336
01:44:35,739 --> 01:44:38,731
He has a right to know
what kind of a person I am.

1337
01:44:40,019 --> 01:44:41,850
I'm going to tell him

1338
01:44:41,979 --> 01:44:45,289
that I'm a different kind of person
than he thinks I am.

1339
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:50,371
I'm not wonderful,

1340
01:44:51,219 --> 01:44:54,768
not kind, I'm not clean.

1341
01:44:58,939 --> 01:45:02,136
Telling you these things is easy,
because you're a stranger

1342
01:45:02,259 --> 01:45:04,329
and I'll never see you again.

1343
01:45:06,459 --> 01:45:08,017
Telling him is...

1344
01:45:09,339 --> 01:45:12,809
It's going to be one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life,

1345
01:45:14,499 --> 01:45:16,171
'cause in my heart,

1346
01:45:18,259 --> 01:45:20,011
I'll always see him

1347
01:45:21,579 --> 01:45:24,252
even when he turns his back
and walks away.

1348
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:33,572
Look at my face.

1349
01:45:35,299 --> 01:45:37,096
Wouldn't you walk away?

1350
01:45:39,579 --> 01:45:42,218
I'm so much older
than my years have made me.

1351
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:46,419
Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.

1352
01:45:46,939 --> 01:45:49,009
You'll see how very old I am.

1353
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:53,128
I'm beat.

1354
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,294
I'll make a swell-looking bride.

1355
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:00,092
A beat bride.

1356
01:46:03,419 --> 01:46:05,455
But I'm not afraid anymore.

1357
01:46:08,379 --> 01:46:11,735
Now that I know what's going to happen,
I'm almost happy.

1358
01:46:15,899 --> 01:46:18,811
So, I wasn't making up my face
a few minutes ago.

1359
01:46:21,099 --> 01:46:23,454
I was looking in the mirror, at me.

1360
01:46:26,419 --> 01:46:28,979
Does that answer your question,
mister?

1361
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:32,978
I was mistaken.

1362
01:46:34,219 --> 01:46:37,734
You aren't a fatalist.
You're a very courageous young lady.

1363
01:46:39,979 --> 01:46:43,574
Maybe some of it will brush off on me
if I keep sitting here.

1364
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:47,616
Maybe I can throw a few things
out of my own life.

1365
01:47:08,459 --> 01:47:11,371
-Cigarette?
-No, thanks. I don't use them things.

1366
01:47:18,459 --> 01:47:20,575
-Do you have to do that?
-Yeah.

1367
01:47:26,459 --> 01:47:28,768
Could I have my property back now?

1368
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:32,016
-Why?
-It would mean a great deal to me.

1369
01:47:33,019 --> 01:47:36,091
Take away this feeling
of being constantly watched.

1370
01:47:37,459 --> 01:47:40,451
I'm all right, now. Quite calm.
You can trust me.

1371
01:47:51,379 --> 01:47:52,528
Sit down.

1372
01:47:54,059 --> 01:47:58,769
You got lots to think about,
and maybe not so much time for to do it.

1373
01:48:19,299 --> 01:48:22,735
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

1374
01:48:22,859 --> 01:48:26,249
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1375
01:48:27,379 --> 01:48:29,176
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1376
01:48:29,299 --> 01:48:31,608
hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come...

1377
01:48:36,859 --> 01:48:38,372
Sparks, get on the horn.

1378
01:48:38,499 --> 01:48:40,729
Advised interception completed at 56.

1379
01:48:47,419 --> 01:48:49,296
Okay, Dan. I'll take over.

1380
01:49:04,059 --> 01:49:07,290
Go back now. Take the Gibson girl,
get the passengers all set.

1381
01:49:07,419 --> 01:49:09,330
You'll have plenty of time.

1382
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:13,737
Turn on the seat belt sign 10 minutes
before we start for the water.

1383
01:49:24,699 --> 01:49:26,417
Good luck, you guys.

1384
01:49:29,379 --> 01:49:32,098
-Anything new with the wind, Lennie?
-No.

1385
01:49:32,419 --> 01:49:34,296
We're not very fat, then?

1386
01:49:34,419 --> 01:49:39,095
-If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.
-Eleven minutes? Is that all you need?

1387
01:49:39,619 --> 01:49:42,577
-Are you sure?
-I know exactly where we are now.

1388
01:49:42,939 --> 01:49:45,134
Eleven minutes more of fuel
would see us through.

1389
01:49:45,259 --> 01:49:49,491
What increase in wind velocity would
we need to arrange that little thing?

1390
01:49:49,619 --> 01:49:51,530
Twenty knots in the next hour.

1391
01:49:51,659 --> 01:49:53,775
-That's asking a lot.
-Yeah.

1392
01:49:54,579 --> 01:49:56,649
It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.

1393
01:49:56,779 --> 01:49:59,339
But if the wind swung around
a little more in the tail

1394
01:49:59,459 --> 01:50:00,733
it could be.

1395
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:07,692
I guess they'll pick us up
before we get too damp.

1396
01:50:07,819 --> 01:50:09,650
Susie will sure be worried.

1397
01:50:09,939 --> 01:50:13,215
She'll lay down the law.
Probably insist I quit flying.

1398
01:50:15,099 --> 01:50:16,293
Will you?

1399
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:20,568
No.

1400
01:50:28,059 --> 01:50:31,176
-Everything's here. I just hope it works.
-It will.

1401
01:50:33,339 --> 01:50:35,728
Wouldn't you rather
not have to depend on it?

1402
01:50:35,859 --> 01:50:38,578
-What do you mean?
-Suppose we didn't ditch.

1403
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:39,973
You've got to.

1404
01:50:40,619 --> 01:50:44,373
Lennie says all we need
is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.

1405
01:50:45,339 --> 01:50:47,978
Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.

1406
01:50:49,779 --> 01:50:53,374
Would you think I was wrong
if I tried to talk him out of it?

1407
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:55,816
Maybe try a little luck?

1408
01:50:57,059 --> 01:50:58,094
Luck?

1409
01:50:58,299 --> 01:51:00,290
That's has-been thinking.

1410
01:51:00,459 --> 01:51:02,927
Wanna run out of fuel,
right over San Francisco?

1411
01:51:03,059 --> 01:51:05,732
Wipe out a few bridges
or apartment houses?

1412
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:09,852
Sullivan's been over this ocean
lots of times. He knows his business.

1413
01:51:10,459 --> 01:51:12,814
I've seen men act like this before.

1414
01:51:13,779 --> 01:51:16,657
Sometimes because of one thing
or another,

1415
01:51:17,819 --> 01:51:20,287
fella stops thinking straight temporarily.

1416
01:51:26,739 --> 01:51:28,889
I've been flying a long time, Hobie.

1417
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:33,937
Only, you're not the captain.

1418
01:51:34,059 --> 01:51:35,651
Maybe because your so-called luck

1419
01:51:35,779 --> 01:51:38,498
ran out on you once
down in South America.

1420
01:51:38,779 --> 01:51:40,690
This is no luck operation.

1421
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:46,459
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1422
01:51:46,459 --> 01:51:46,697
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1423
01:51:50,859 --> 01:51:51,928
Maybe.

1424
01:52:49,459 --> 01:52:52,929
Here it is, Lennie.
Color may not become you

1425
01:52:53,819 --> 01:52:57,095
-but it'll suffice you.
-Thanks, for nothing.

1426
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:04,214
About that 11 minutes,
are you absolutely sure?

1427
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:06,013
Absolutely.

1428
01:53:14,059 --> 01:53:17,495
Lennie says if we can pick up
11 minutes, we can make it.

1429
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:25,297
He could be right.

1430
01:53:29,899 --> 01:53:33,255
It'll be rough down there.
If we hit wrong, we've had it.

1431
01:53:35,939 --> 01:53:40,455
Maybe we ought to ease off a little on
the power and save a few drops of fuel.

1432
01:53:42,659 --> 01:53:44,615
Any objections if I try it?

1433
01:53:49,819 --> 01:53:51,969
This won't work.
She's going to stall on me.

1434
01:53:52,099 --> 01:53:54,135
That's no good.
We'll blow another engine.

1435
01:53:54,259 --> 01:53:57,251
What's the difference?
We'll blow them all if we ditch.

1436
01:53:57,699 --> 01:54:00,372
Put those controls back
where they belong.

1437
01:54:00,939 --> 01:54:03,499
-Put those props back.
-Nothing doing, Skipper.

1438
01:54:03,619 --> 01:54:05,098
That's an order!

1439
01:54:06,379 --> 01:54:09,610
Hang on, chum. You can do it.
Now fly and let me pray.

1440
01:54:09,739 --> 01:54:11,775
We'll run out of gas,
right over San Francisco.

1441
01:54:11,899 --> 01:54:15,972
Let's try out this way for a while.
Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!

1442
01:54:16,579 --> 01:54:18,774
-She's starting to shake again.
-Let her shake!

1443
01:54:18,899 --> 01:54:22,130
Let her mush down a few feet if you
have to. We're saving fuel this way.

1444
01:54:22,259 --> 01:54:23,658
Hang on and fly!

1445
01:54:31,019 --> 01:54:32,577
Did you call Sullivan's wife?

1446
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,849
Yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport.

1447
01:54:34,979 --> 01:54:36,458
-You didn't alarm her?
-No.

1448
01:54:36,579 --> 01:54:40,015
I just told her, her husband was on
his way, and that you wanted to see her.

1449
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:41,891
Then she knows something's happened.

1450
01:54:42,019 --> 01:54:44,613
Probably. But her voice was quite calm.

1451
01:54:45,299 --> 01:54:46,937
How about the others?

1452
01:54:47,059 --> 01:54:50,688
Wheeler lives with another pilot,
Dupree. There was no answer.

1453
01:54:51,219 --> 01:54:52,811
The same for Wilby.

1454
01:54:53,139 --> 01:54:56,814
I called his home
and then a bar I know about.

1455
01:54:57,459 --> 01:55:00,690
His wife had been there,
but she left about an hour ago,

1456
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:01,888
drunk.

1457
01:55:04,179 --> 01:55:07,296
-The stewardess?
-No, Spalding's mother isn't well.

1458
01:55:07,419 --> 01:55:09,933
Her father is out of town on business.

1459
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:12,810
I wish I could tell them all together.

1460
01:55:12,939 --> 01:55:15,533
I think maybe they could
help each other.

1461
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:18,378
There isn't anybody listed on there
for Dan Roman.

1462
01:55:18,499 --> 01:55:21,571
-Do you know any person close to him?
-Yeah.

1463
01:55:22,419 --> 01:55:25,695
But I don't think you could reach her.
Dan lives alone.

1464
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:56,572
-Is everything all right?
-Just great, junior.

1465
01:55:59,259 --> 01:56:01,250
This is a stunning garment.

1466
01:56:01,779 --> 01:56:04,247
I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.

1467
01:56:05,619 --> 01:56:08,338
It's a frowsy looking shroud,
if you ask me.

1468
01:56:12,979 --> 01:56:14,048
Baby.

1469
01:56:17,419 --> 01:56:21,253
I went through the first World War
and the Blitz in London.

1470
01:56:23,539 --> 01:56:25,734
I was scared, but not like this.

1471
01:56:30,419 --> 01:56:34,048
I want to show you something cute.
Want to see something cute?

1472
01:56:35,579 --> 01:56:37,331
I must be slipping.

1473
01:56:37,459 --> 01:56:41,611
No reaction, even from a man like you,
who should appreciate such things.

1474
01:56:44,979 --> 01:56:48,574
Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.

1475
01:56:50,579 --> 01:56:51,978
I'm frightened.

1476
01:56:52,099 --> 01:56:55,136
Talking. Honey, you don't know
what you're asking.

1477
01:56:55,699 --> 01:56:57,849
I'll tell you a good joke on me.

1478
01:56:57,979 --> 01:57:01,130
You know, I always dreaded
the idea of becoming an old woman,

1479
01:57:01,259 --> 01:57:05,457
and from the way things look now,
I won't have to worry about it anymore.

1480
01:57:07,379 --> 01:57:09,495
You know, I haven't been whistled at
in years.

1481
01:57:09,619 --> 01:57:11,337
And the idea of growing roses

1482
01:57:11,459 --> 01:57:14,451
for the rest of my life
was really beginning to haunt me.

1483
01:57:16,659 --> 01:57:19,810
There ought to be a home
for dames like me.

1484
01:57:19,939 --> 01:57:21,691
We should have organized.

1485
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:25,656
You know, a house somewhere
with no mirror in it.

1486
01:57:26,779 --> 01:57:30,055
Far away, where we'd never have
to look at a young girl.

1487
01:57:30,859 --> 01:57:33,327
They have homes
for unmarried mothers.

1488
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:36,577
But everybody forgets
about the girls who

1489
01:57:37,259 --> 01:57:40,774
never quite managed
to make things legal.

1490
01:57:42,779 --> 01:57:44,690
I think I could start one.

1491
01:57:45,979 --> 01:57:50,495
I can call it the "May Holst Home
for Broken-down Broads."

1492
01:57:52,819 --> 01:57:54,969
I kind of like that, don't you?

1493
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:08,939
Well, they're as ready now
as they'll ever be.

1494
01:58:10,099 --> 01:58:12,329
Can you take something else
in your stride?

1495
01:58:12,459 --> 01:58:13,448
I can try.

1496
01:58:13,579 --> 01:58:14,648
Good.

1497
01:58:14,779 --> 01:58:16,656
I want you to do me a favor.

1498
01:58:19,059 --> 01:58:22,415
Look, when I tell you, sit down there
with your back against that seat,

1499
01:58:22,539 --> 01:58:24,609
stay there,
no matter what else is going on.

1500
01:58:24,739 --> 01:58:27,492
Don't try to be a heroine
because in those last few moments,

1501
01:58:27,619 --> 01:58:30,975
there isn't anything in the world
you can do to help anybody.

1502
01:58:31,099 --> 01:58:33,408
You know, your face
can improve any landscape.

1503
01:58:33,539 --> 01:58:35,131
I want you to keep it that way.

1504
01:58:35,259 --> 01:58:36,817
So the favor for me is this pillow.

1505
01:58:36,939 --> 01:58:40,056
Hold it tightly over your face,
for yourself and for me.

1506
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:42,488
With the wind and the sea
neither God nor Sullivan

1507
01:58:42,619 --> 01:58:44,689
can set this thing down tonight
like an egg crate.

1508
01:58:44,819 --> 01:58:48,698
We might just as well slam
into a mountain. Dan knows it. I know it.

1509
01:58:48,819 --> 01:58:50,047
And so does Sullivan.

1510
01:58:56,259 --> 01:58:58,898
Wilby, check your final position.
I'm going to take her down.

1511
01:58:59,019 --> 01:59:00,532
-Wait a few more minutes.
-Do as I say.

1512
01:59:00,659 --> 01:59:02,012
-But it looks like...
-Do as I say.

1513
01:59:02,139 --> 01:59:03,367
Give him a few more minutes.

1514
01:59:03,499 --> 01:59:05,729
I've already waited too long.
Here we go.

1515
01:59:05,859 --> 01:59:09,693
No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself,
you yellow...

1516
01:59:17,459 --> 01:59:19,336
420 is losing altitude, sir.

1517
01:59:19,459 --> 01:59:21,131
420, from Coast Guard.

1518
01:59:21,459 --> 01:59:24,576
Radar reports you're descending.
Are you going to ditch?

1519
01:59:27,219 --> 01:59:30,529
You are now below the minimum legal
altitude for approaching the coast.

1520
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:33,457
Time's wasting.
You better climb or settle for the drink.

1521
01:59:33,579 --> 01:59:36,651
We're right with you. We'll follow you
down. Advise immediately.

1522
01:59:37,699 --> 01:59:41,214
420 to Coast Guard.

1523
01:59:42,099 --> 01:59:44,659
We've been too busy to answer.
Stand by.

1524
01:59:45,219 --> 01:59:47,335
We may have a change in plans.

1525
01:59:57,739 --> 02:00:00,378
Thirty minutes of fuel left.
Cross-feed problem.

1526
02:00:01,259 --> 02:00:03,136
Throw the rule book away.

1527
02:00:03,379 --> 02:00:06,337
Highest obstruction, 1, 950 feet,

1528
02:00:06,459 --> 02:00:08,768
so 2,200 will be safe.

1529
02:00:11,299 --> 02:00:14,609
Leonard, stand by electric altimeter,
call out readings.

1530
02:00:14,739 --> 02:00:17,014
Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.

1531
02:00:17,139 --> 02:00:19,733
More efficient use of fuel against time.

1532
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:21,771
Study approach book.

1533
02:00:22,379 --> 02:00:24,654
Air Traffic Control to clear area.

1534
02:00:24,819 --> 02:00:27,174
Direction finders on range station.

1535
02:00:28,219 --> 02:00:29,732
Start right now.

1536
02:00:32,499 --> 02:00:33,488
Dan?

1537
02:00:34,339 --> 02:00:35,328
Yeah?

1538
02:00:36,259 --> 02:00:37,374
Thanks.

1539
02:00:38,339 --> 02:00:41,092
Thanks for knocking some sense
into my head.

1540
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:44,378
-Someday I'll explain.
-You don't have to.

1541
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:49,567
We're not going to ditch.
We'll make San Francisco the hard way.

1542
02:00:50,819 --> 02:00:52,218
Any change in the wind, Lennie?

1543
02:00:52,339 --> 02:00:53,977
We picked up three of those
11 minutes.

1544
02:00:54,099 --> 02:00:56,932
Bring me the approach chart
for San Francisco.

1545
02:01:00,859 --> 02:01:02,736
Whistle me a tune, Dan.

1546
02:01:03,899 --> 02:01:05,810
I like music while I work.

1547
02:01:18,819 --> 02:01:22,334
-Can I get you something, Mr. Briscoe?
-Yes. A ham sandwich.

1548
02:01:22,499 --> 02:01:26,094
I can't. Everything went overboard.
Now you put on that vest.

1549
02:01:26,339 --> 02:01:27,533
Great service.

1550
02:01:27,659 --> 02:01:30,856
You throw all the food to the sharks,
so you won't have to serve it.

1551
02:01:31,339 --> 02:01:33,295
Tell you what. Proposition.

1552
02:01:33,779 --> 02:01:36,771
I think Miss Chen will let me
buy her a steak in San Francisco,

1553
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:38,935
if you come along, too.

1554
02:01:39,059 --> 02:01:41,573
If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.

1555
02:01:42,179 --> 02:01:44,613
Mr. Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.

1556
02:01:52,499 --> 02:01:54,854
-Take a breather, Dan.
-Okay.

1557
02:02:00,339 --> 02:02:02,057
The Farallon Islands, any minute now.

1558
02:02:04,979 --> 02:02:07,174
-Don't go any lower.
-No. I'll hold this altitude.

1559
02:02:07,299 --> 02:02:09,938
Get back and call out our altitude
on the radio altimeter.

1560
02:02:10,059 --> 02:02:12,937
We'll make straight for the
northwest leg of San Francisco range.

1561
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:15,653
The area's been cleared
and we're practically on the ground.

1562
02:02:15,779 --> 02:02:17,849
I like the way you said that.

1563
02:02:28,379 --> 02:02:31,257
Twenty-eight miles to go.
He's made first base.

1564
02:02:31,379 --> 02:02:34,098
But if that guy runs out of fuel
between here and the airport,

1565
02:02:34,219 --> 02:02:36,096
I don't know where he'll put
that thing down

1566
02:02:36,219 --> 02:02:37,732
except in the middle of Market Street.

1567
02:02:50,339 --> 02:02:51,977
Shut that thing off.

1568
02:02:57,419 --> 02:02:58,408
Well?

1569
02:03:01,059 --> 02:03:04,847
I'm going over to the terminal.
If needed, I'll be in the control tower.

1570
02:03:43,379 --> 02:03:45,131
This is it. Ten minutes.

1571
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:47,816
Come on, let's make a final check.

1572
02:03:53,779 --> 02:03:54,848
Inflate your vest, please.

1573
02:03:54,979 --> 02:03:56,935
-We're going down?
-Yeah, but you'll be all right.

1574
02:03:57,059 --> 02:03:59,892
Take your time coming back to the door.
Wait until I yell.

1575
02:04:00,019 --> 02:04:03,375
-Coast Guard plane still with us?
-Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.

1576
02:04:03,499 --> 02:04:05,057
Put out your cigarette, please.

1577
02:04:05,179 --> 02:04:08,251
Inflate your vest, Mr. Childs.
You too, Miss Holst.

1578
02:04:09,899 --> 02:04:13,175
-Some brassiere.
-Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.

1579
02:04:13,819 --> 02:04:15,411
I really ought to take my briefcase.

1580
02:04:15,539 --> 02:04:18,007
Sorry, nothing doing.
Inflate your vest, please.

1581
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:23,974
I can't.

1582
02:04:24,459 --> 02:04:25,858
I'm terrified.

1583
02:04:26,819 --> 02:04:28,491
I can't seem to move.

1584
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:35,496
Don't worry. Good luck.

1585
02:04:38,859 --> 02:04:41,089
-All set, you two?
-We're still hungry.

1586
02:04:41,219 --> 02:04:44,131
Our steak date is postponed.
Inflate your vest, please.

1587
02:04:49,219 --> 02:04:50,732
Maybe you should keep this.

1588
02:04:50,859 --> 02:04:53,896
I'd loved thinking it was mine,
even if it was just for a few hours.

1589
02:04:54,019 --> 02:04:56,249
Nonsense.
You can keep it as dry as I can.

1590
02:04:56,379 --> 02:04:58,495
If it's still working tomorrow night
at 7:00,

1591
02:04:58,619 --> 02:05:01,691
take a cab to Ernie's restaurant
on Montgomery street.

1592
02:05:01,899 --> 02:05:04,333
If it isn't working, come anyway.

1593
02:05:04,779 --> 02:05:05,894
Thanks.

1594
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:08,774
We got them all to blow up, see?

1595
02:05:08,979 --> 02:05:12,130
Good work. Remember take your time
coming back to the door.

1596
02:05:12,459 --> 02:05:13,608
You want?

1597
02:05:13,779 --> 02:05:15,895
No, thanks. Thanks just the same.

1598
02:05:16,019 --> 02:05:19,614
If anything happens to me,
get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.

1599
02:05:19,739 --> 02:05:22,890
-Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken.
-You tell her yourself, mister.

1600
02:05:23,019 --> 02:05:26,694
You'll be all right. I'm not worrying and
I'll be the last guy off this airplane.

1601
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:29,379
-Do you have to be?
-That's what I get paid for.

1602
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:33,009
-Seat belt tight?
-I think so.

1603
02:05:34,299 --> 02:05:35,812
This is for real, isn't it?

1604
02:05:35,939 --> 02:05:38,533
I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.

1605
02:05:43,499 --> 02:05:45,535
Well, even I might float.

1606
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:50,410
Inflate your vest, please.

1607
02:06:02,859 --> 02:06:05,851
I don't want to die.

1608
02:06:05,979 --> 02:06:09,210
Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.

1609
02:06:10,739 --> 02:06:14,095
Give her two of these when you can.
They'll quiet her.

1610
02:06:43,179 --> 02:06:46,296
Stand by for anything. Sullivan is gonna
try and make San Francisco.

1611
02:06:46,419 --> 02:06:47,613
-Can we?
-I don't see how.

1612
02:06:47,739 --> 02:06:50,378
Technically, we're out of fuel right now.

1613
02:06:53,259 --> 02:06:54,772
We've bought it.

1614
02:07:07,899 --> 02:07:11,096
550 feet, Skipper.
The coast hills must be coming up.

1615
02:07:11,219 --> 02:07:13,050
-Watch it!
-400, a little less.

1616
02:07:13,179 --> 02:07:14,328
Hang on!

1617
02:07:17,059 --> 02:07:18,174
330.

1618
02:07:18,619 --> 02:07:19,608
250.

1619
02:07:20,019 --> 02:07:21,213
Ground's coming up fast!

1620
02:07:25,259 --> 02:07:26,977
200, Skipper. This ain't good.

1621
02:07:29,899 --> 02:07:30,888
180.

1622
02:07:38,339 --> 02:07:40,091
420, from Coast Guard.

1623
02:07:40,419 --> 02:07:42,808
Twin Peaks coming up on your left
in a minute or so.

1624
02:07:42,939 --> 02:07:45,373
Remember those radio towers.
Stay on course.

1625
02:07:45,739 --> 02:07:47,491
Don't descend anymore.

1626
02:07:47,859 --> 02:07:49,850
Thanks. We're trying not to.

1627
02:07:50,819 --> 02:07:52,537
150 feet, Skipper!

1628
02:09:27,179 --> 02:09:29,568
300 feet, Skipper.
We must be past the hills.

1629
02:09:36,499 --> 02:09:37,488
400.

1630
02:09:41,219 --> 02:09:42,777
500. We're living!

1631
02:09:51,739 --> 02:09:55,698
420, this is San Francisco Towers.
Special weather.

1632
02:09:56,099 --> 02:10:00,331
Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.
Wind, west northwest.

1633
02:10:00,699 --> 02:10:02,735
Twenty to 25. Over.

1634
02:10:03,539 --> 02:10:07,293
Okay, San Francisco Tower.
We'll make an ILS approach.

1635
02:10:07,779 --> 02:10:10,213
Turn the runway lights up full blast.

1636
02:11:02,739 --> 02:11:05,333
-Cone of silence.
-Right with you, chum.

1637
02:11:05,459 --> 02:11:08,576
-We're cleared straight on down.
-This is going to be a fast one.

1638
02:11:08,699 --> 02:11:10,929
Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.

1639
02:11:15,099 --> 02:11:17,169
Get the outer marker, Dan.

1640
02:11:17,859 --> 02:11:21,010
Outer marker identified.
But we're way below our glide path,

1641
02:11:21,139 --> 02:11:22,288
so watch it, chum.

1642
02:11:22,419 --> 02:11:25,013
There's a 690-foot radio tower
around here someplace.

1643
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:27,972
Has to be behind us,
we're right on the approach leg.

1644
02:11:28,499 --> 02:11:30,774
Let me know it when they're clear.

1645
02:11:53,819 --> 02:11:56,174
Feather it, Dan! Quick!
No time to fool with it.

1646
02:11:59,219 --> 02:12:01,608
Give me full power on the other two.

1647
02:12:04,099 --> 02:12:06,090
-You see anything?
-Not yet.

1648
02:12:30,259 --> 02:12:31,772
-Contact yet?
-No.

1649
02:12:35,299 --> 02:12:38,575
-This is a sweater.
-You're doing fine.

1650
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:42,691
When we pass the inner marker,
I'm shoving her down regardless.

1651
02:12:42,819 --> 02:12:43,808
Yeah.

1652
02:12:48,579 --> 02:12:50,934
Approach lights dead ahead.
Maybe a mile.

1653
02:12:51,059 --> 02:12:52,572
Give her the gear.

1654
02:12:53,659 --> 02:12:55,217
Three green lights and pressure.

1655
02:13:00,459 --> 02:13:03,371
We can only stay in the air
another 30 seconds.

1656
02:13:03,899 --> 02:13:06,618
-Full flaps.
-Full flaps.

1657
02:13:18,419 --> 02:13:21,013
Now I lay me down to sleep.

1658
02:14:17,619 --> 02:14:20,053
Did you get hurt?
Was anyone hurt at all?

1659
02:14:32,219 --> 02:14:33,493
Two more coming down now.

1660
02:14:33,619 --> 02:14:35,018
There's Mr. Pardee,
the famous producer.

1661
02:14:35,139 --> 02:14:37,130
He'll give us some information.

1662
02:14:40,139 --> 02:14:42,937
-You're Gustave Pardee, aren't you?
-I was. I'm not so sure now.

1663
02:14:43,059 --> 02:14:44,970
Please leave us alone. We're very tired.

1664
02:14:45,099 --> 02:14:46,691
Give us a few words about your flight.

1665
02:14:46,819 --> 02:14:48,650
I couldn't tell you.
Not in a million words.

1666
02:14:48,779 --> 02:14:52,215
-What will your next production be?
-It will take a little longer than usual.

1667
02:14:52,339 --> 02:14:53,897
-Next year, I hope.
-Next year?

1668
02:14:54,019 --> 02:14:55,338
Now, please let us pass.

1669
02:15:05,779 --> 02:15:06,848
Sally!

1670
02:15:09,539 --> 02:15:10,813
Who are you?

1671
02:15:27,299 --> 02:15:28,652
Miss, just one statement.

1672
02:15:29,339 --> 02:15:31,899
-Tell us who you are.
-What's your name?

1673
02:15:36,059 --> 02:15:37,811
-Why, it's a boy!
-Little boy.

1674
02:15:37,939 --> 02:15:41,011
He'll sure have a story
to tell his grandkids.

1675
02:15:50,459 --> 02:15:54,168
-Daddy wants you to come and see him.
-I will, darling. I will!

1676
02:15:55,739 --> 02:15:59,049
Look at my space material.

1677
02:16:04,579 --> 02:16:07,047
-Here he is. Who's that?
-Give us a statement.

1678
02:16:09,419 --> 02:16:12,217
Where's the nearest telephone?
I have to call Honolulu, my wife.

1679
02:16:12,339 --> 02:16:13,533
-Over there.
-Thanks.

1680
02:16:13,659 --> 02:16:15,058
No questions, please.

1681
02:16:15,179 --> 02:16:16,578
What happened?

1682
02:16:16,779 --> 02:16:18,895
Here she is.

1683
02:16:19,899 --> 02:16:22,094
Hold it right there. Thank you.

1684
02:16:22,219 --> 02:16:23,891
She must be in show business.

1685
02:16:24,019 --> 02:16:25,930
She's in show business, all right.

1686
02:16:29,819 --> 02:16:31,571
She's the star of the Follies!

1687
02:16:33,379 --> 02:16:34,732
Tell us your story.

1688
02:16:35,939 --> 02:16:37,338
Just one.

1689
02:16:47,699 --> 02:16:50,259
Papa!

1690
02:16:53,659 --> 02:16:55,251
Just a moment.

1691
02:16:57,259 --> 02:17:00,854
Listen, boys. I'm just a fisherman.
I want to see my kids.

1692
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:17,449
Thirty gallons, Mr. Garfield.
That's all there was left in all the tanks.

1693
02:17:17,579 --> 02:17:19,615
Too little to really measure.

1694
02:17:23,739 --> 02:17:26,253
Tell this man we must have
reservations on the plane,

1695
02:17:26,379 --> 02:17:27,494
first thing tomorrow morning.

1696
02:17:27,619 --> 02:17:30,531
We'll miss Elvira's party.
It's important to you.

1697
02:17:30,659 --> 02:17:32,809
What's Elvira's party
got to do with sled dogs?

1698
02:17:32,939 --> 02:17:34,850
Really, darling. Don't be tiresome.

1699
02:17:34,979 --> 02:17:38,767
We might as well play safe until you find
out how things are going to turn out.

1700
02:17:38,899 --> 02:17:40,412
All right, Lydia.

1701
02:18:21,019 --> 02:18:22,293
Hello, Pete.

1702
02:18:22,779 --> 02:18:25,771
Meet us out front.
We're going for our steaks.

1703
02:18:28,539 --> 02:18:31,770
Ten minutes, Mr. Briscoe,
I'll be there for sure.

1704
02:19:18,299 --> 02:19:20,017
-Hi.
-Hi, Mr. Garfield.

1705
02:19:23,339 --> 02:19:26,092
-I think your wife's waiting for you.
-Yeah.

1706
02:19:26,979 --> 02:19:30,528
I don't want to keep her
standing too long. We're expecting.

1707
02:19:30,939 --> 02:19:33,851
When you get rested, call me.
We'll have a talk.

1708
02:19:34,339 --> 02:19:36,409
Yeah, sure.

1709
02:19:41,219 --> 02:19:42,493
Good night.

1710
02:19:43,619 --> 02:19:44,893
Good night.

1711
02:19:48,259 --> 02:19:50,136
Good night, Mr. Garfield.

1712
02:19:55,619 --> 02:19:57,894
-Souvenir?
-For my wife.

1713
02:19:58,739 --> 02:20:01,492
I guess the rain won't hurt it,
better get it home though.

1714
02:20:01,619 --> 02:20:03,894
Susie will be waiting. Good night.

1715
02:20:15,979 --> 02:20:19,415
Well, I guess I better get going.
Little past my bedtime.

1716
02:20:19,779 --> 02:20:21,610
You had 30 gallons left.

1717
02:20:23,579 --> 02:20:24,614
Yeah.

1718
02:20:26,019 --> 02:20:28,408
Good night. We'll get together soon.

1719
02:20:29,659 --> 02:20:30,933
Sure, chum.

1720
02:20:43,219 --> 02:20:44,413
So long.

1721
02:20:46,459 --> 02:20:49,257
So long, you ancient pelican.
