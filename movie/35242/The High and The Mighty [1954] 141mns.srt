1
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,064
Hey, fella.

2
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,748
Ain't you Dan Roman?

3
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,705
Yeah.

4
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,186
I heard you whistling
and I said to myself,

5
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,221
only one guy does that just so.

6
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,585
I'd know that
ugly face of yours anywhere.

7
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,268
But you don't remember me, I bet you.

8
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,028
Sure I do. Ben Sneed.

9
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,862
I thought you'd be milking cows
somewheres on your own...

10
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,700
I mean, I thought you'd quit flying.

11
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,384
I thought you'd stay away
from these things.

12
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,379
They're only a hunk of metal.
They don't go no place in particular.

13
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,070
I guess I just haven't got
much willpower, Ben.

14
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,063
- What are you up to?
- Crew chiefing with Far East.

15
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,664
It's a good job.

16
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,945
I gotta go, Dan.

17
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,222
- I just thought I'd say hello.
- Sure. Good luck.

18
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,185
- Either one of you know that man?
- Sure looks old for a copilot.

19
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,700
- Didn't know we were so hard up.
- He weren't always a copilot.

20
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,260
We used to call him "Whistling Dan. "

21
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,740
One of the finest men you'd ever know.

22
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,819
And the most miserable. He was
down in Colombia same time I was.

23
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,704
He's taking off one night
with a full load

24
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,786
and one of them South American
line squalls

25
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,980
decided to hit the field at the same time.

26
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,500
The wind shifts too late for him to stop
and he don't quite make it over

27
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,143
a little hill at the end of the field.

28
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,226
I remember that one.
Right after the war, right?

29
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,740
Yeah. Dan hits flap,
but the ship breaks in half

30
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,065
and there's nothing but fire
in 10 seconds.

31
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,146
Dan gets tossed
through the cockpit window

32
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,228
and only gets a few scratches
plus that game leg of his.

33
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,418
Which leaves him alive to blame
himself. Everybody else gets killed.

34
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,305
Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.

35
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,386
It don't work out quite that way.

36
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,345
I knew two of the passengers.
They were off to the coast for a holiday.

37
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,538
Blonde girl, name of Mary
and a little boy, name of Tony.

38
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,100
Everybody thought
they were wonderful people,

39
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,629
including Dan Roman.

40
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,189
Mary was Dan's wife
and little Tony was his only kid.

41
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,339
Yup.

42
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,348
Dan is the only guy I ever knew who
had guts enough not to commit suicide.

43
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,541
<i>Flight 21 now arriving,

45

Nice to have you with us, Mr Flaherty.
Please check with immigration now.

You'll board in about 30 minutes.

47
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,500
This is Miss Spalding, your stewardess.

48
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,543
- I'll be in the bar.
- We'll call you, Mr Flaherty.

49
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,899
Trouble.

50
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,865
- Mr and Mrs Joseph?
- Yes, sirree.

51
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,505
The Waikiki kids. Just put us down
as a float for the Rose Bowl parade.

52
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,144
- Your age, Mr Joseph?
- Today?

53
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,307
No, I'm 38, so help me.

54
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,622
- Birthplace?
- Passaic, New Jersey.

55
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,344
That's the Garden State.
Motto. Liberty and prosperity.

56
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,700
Bounded on the north by New York,
on the south by...

57
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,869
- And Mrs Joseph?
- Shall I tell him? I'm 33,

58
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,386
and I was born in Ogden, Utah.

59
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,658
Thank you, immensely.

60
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,865
Aloha.

61
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,307
- Hey, look. Remember?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,785
My name is Sally McKee.
I'm 30 years old.

63
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,666
I was born in Riverside, California.

64
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,141
- You're still a United States citizen?
- Yes, of course.

65
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,547
Thank you, Miss McKee.
Please check with immigration.

66
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,981
Your flight will be announced.

67
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,185
She may be put together
with paste and flour,

68
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,143
but that woman has something.
What would you say it was?

69
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,909
Practise. Plenty of practise.

70
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,388
- Aren't you...
- Yes, I'm Gustave Pardee.

71
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,182
I've enjoyed your New York shows
very much.

72
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,379
Good. Delighted.

73
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,704
Here are our tickets.

74
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,549
I'm 47 and I was born in New York City.

75
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,144
Mrs Pardee?

76
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,945
I'm 30,
and I was born in Owosso, Michigan.

77
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,428
- How will the weather be?
- Fine, Mr Pardee.

78
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,506
You should have a very pleasant trip.

79
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,148
He looks like a tired walrus on a rock.

80
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,865
She looks like she's done all right
for a slender redhead from Owosso.

81
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,460
- Ken Childs, 53. Born in Philadelphia.
- Yes, Mr Childs.

82
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,627
I don't know where my luggage is. The
Royal was supposed to send it down.

83
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,103
We'll check right into it, sir.

84
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,505
May I introduce your stewardess,
Miss Spalding.

85
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,188
Hello, sister. New here, aren't you?

86
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,221
Four months now with the company,
Mr Childs.

87
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,740
Good. I don't know where they get
some of the girls

88
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,862
but things are improving.

89
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,182
One of the few men who has ever made
any real money out of aviation.

90
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,029
He's one of our stockholders.
Treat him accordingly.

91
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,264
If you please.

92
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,828
- Dorothy Chen?
- Yes.

93
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,904
- Born in Antung, Manchuria?
- Yes, but I am Korean.

94
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,625
You have your passport handy,
of course.

95
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,309
Please take it to immigration.
It's just over there.

96
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,786
It's a real pleasure
to have you with us, Miss Chen.

97
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,104

98
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,909
- That face.
- A moon and a willow tree.

buying a present for my wife.

102
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,505
Susie will sure be excited
when she sees this.

103
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,819
Yeah.

104
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,305
I already been up to Weather.
The winds aren't too bad.

105
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,579
Let's try 9,000 for a change.

106
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,701

3,050 gallons be all right

109
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,778
Sounds all right,
let's see what Leonard says.

110
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,146
It looks about 12 hours and 16 minutes,

111
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,862

Say, Skipper, how old would you say
Dan Roman is?

116
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,263
He was flying planes before I was born.
Look at it yourself.

117
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,418
He flew the airmail
in the open-cockpit days.

118
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,144
I think he learned to fly
in the first World War.

119
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,462
And endurance flights, racing,
old-time barnstorming.

120
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,900
Ten or 15 years with Transworld.

121
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,020
In the second World War, he flew
a bomber in the Ploiesti oilfield raid.

122
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,225
He took his cracks at Germany
in B-17 s,

123
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,702
finally wound up with a B-29 squad
into Okinawa.

124
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,788
I'll just lay you a bet
he's got better than 20,000 hours.

125
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,220
- It sure is embarrassing.
- What's embarrassing?

126
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,826
He's got so much time and all.

127
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,261
They must've been out of their heads
to hire an old fire-horse like him.

128
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,506
Why not let him graze in the pasture?

129
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,230
- All ready, Lennie?
- All set to sign, Skipper.

133
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,418
Me, too.

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,144
Twenty-one souls onboard.
The rest, cargo.

135
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,267
73,000 pounds gross.

136
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,785
I said it to Orville, I said it to Wilbur,
and I say it to you,

137

the thing will never leave the ground.

You may rely on Miss Spalding to take
good care of your son, Mr Fields.

He's not the first young man

140
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,346
It will be quite an adventure for him.

141
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,189
He's, unfortunately,
quite an experienced traveller.

142
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,902
His mother will meet him
in San Francisco.

143
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,624
She's brunette, and quite beautiful.

144
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,263
If you'll wait at Gate 4, Mr Fields,
you may put Tobey aboard yourself.

154
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,899
You'll make it with time to spare,
Mr Rice.

155
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,146
We'll make it with time to spare.

156
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,859
That little lady had a grandfather
who left her both brains and riches.

157
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,788
She bought her husband
an advertising agency not long ago

158
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,423
because he wanted a new toy.

159
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,903
How do you know these things?

160
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,305
I used to be a night clerk
in a Nevada hotel.

161
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,024
<i>Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.</i>

162
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,620
- Mr Locota?
- Yeah, that's me.

163
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,064
I'm a fisherman.

164
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,988
My family should be in fishermen
for a couple of hundred years,

165
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,702
maybe more, I don't know.

166
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,065
The fish, they don't school up here,

167
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,021
like on the coast of California.

168
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,425
So, I'm gonna go back
to San Francisco now.

169
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,585
Thank you, Mr Locota.

170
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,701
Your plane will be announced
in a few minutes.

171
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,185
Don't you want us
to check that through for you?

172
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,905
But I got in here my things
for to eat for the trip.

173
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,590
You've hurt my feelings, Mr Locota.

174
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,781
Did you think you wouldn't eat my lunch,

175
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,582
or the steak we're gonna have
for dinner?

176
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,986
Ma'am, miss,
I don't know about these things.

177
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,229
I never fly before. I don't want to make
no trouble for nobody.

178
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,580
Serving you will be a pleasure,
Mr Locota.

179
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,029
Thank you.

180
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,820
Just a minute, Mr Locota.
There you are.

181
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,948
Thank you. Excuse me very much.

182
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,947
You didn't know all about that little man.

183
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,948
The ticketing sheet had nothing on him
except statistics.

184
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,220
I'm afraid he falls into
the "nobody" category.

185
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,740
He's gonna be more
than a statistic to me. I like him.

186
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,550
Oh, brother.
Will I be glad to get on that plane.

187
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,228
Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?

188
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,786
Listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.
But this place,

189
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,301
Coney Island with coconuts.

190
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,900
As far as I'm concerned,
you can take all the Hawaiian Islands...

191
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,346
Tobey, will you tell your mother
something for me?

192
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,260
Tell your mother that there shouldn't be
an ocean between us.

193
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,458
Tell her I wish
she'd come with you next time.

194
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,909
- Can you remember all that, Tobey?
- Yes, Daddy.

195
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,102
I got him, Daddy. I got him.

196
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,102
- Everything okay, Dan?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

197
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,906
3,050 aboard.

198
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,386
There's a slight oil leak, Number 4.
Nothing to worry about.

199
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,023
How long does it look like?

200
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,869
Lennie says 12 hours
and 15 minutes, about.

201
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,379
Twelve hours and 16 minutes exactly.

202
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,548
<i>Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.</i>

203
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,864
San Francisco.
I must go to San Francisco.

204
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,868
Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.
You're not on the list.

205
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,106
Mr Kenneth Childs is on your plane,
isn't he?

206
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,458
Why, yes. Mr Childs...

207
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,468
Then you must have room.
I insist. I must go.

208
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,783
Very well, sir. Fortunately
we have space available today

209
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,788
- if you're an American citizen.
- I am. I am for sure.

210
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,947
My name is Humphrey Agnew.
I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.

211
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,220
Right here in Honolulu.
Perhaps you've heard?

212
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,739
Yes. Do you have a travel card,
Mr Agnew?

213
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,349
I pay cash for everything.

214
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,382
If you'll just step across the lobby
and check with immigration,

215
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,343
then come right back here,
we'll have your ticket ready, sir.

216
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,262
Now, there goes a real quack.

217
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,858
He's made a fortune
selling Agnew's aids to better living.

218
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,059
What have you got?

219
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,341
Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness,
sticky liver?

220
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,745
Agnew has got a curing pill
for all of them.

221
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,226
- So long, Alsop. Have fun.
- I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.

222
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,741
May I take your coat, Mrs Pardee?

223
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,339
- You all right, Mr Locota?
- Yes.

224
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,749
- We going to fly very high?
-7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir,

225
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,019
depends on our clearance.

226
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,618
Wouldn't you like to sit
next to the window, Mr Briscoe?

227
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,265
You know something, miss? This is
as far as the old carcass would go.

228
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,699
I'd rather look at you
than what's outside, anyhow.

229
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,344
Your seat belt isn't fastened.
Shame on you.

230
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,310
My arm just won't bend around
the way it should.

231
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,102
- Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.
- I don't see any holes.

232
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,780
You know something, miss?
Neither do I.

233
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,624
Would you like me to take your leis,
put them in a cool place?

234
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,785
They'll keep better.

235
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,947
Now, that's just about the smartest idea
anybody ever had.

236
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,781
Gotta keep them as long as we can.

237
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,578
Gotta get back
to the old salt mines tomorrow.

238
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,707
Get the nose to the grindstone.

239
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,299
That's Hawaiian for "thank you. "

240
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,701
Let me tell you something.
If we get into any trouble,

241
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,538
any serious trouble
that the pilot can't handle,

242
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,104
you just come to old Ed Joseph.

243
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,188
I'll be glad to go up there and help him
if he needs me.

244
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,709
- Got it?
- Got it.

245
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,948
All right, young man,
it's time to get you buckled down now.

246
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,266
Just make you nice and comfy here.

247
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,583
And the next thing you know
we'll be in the air, all right?

248
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,499
- Mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?
- I would be so pleased.

249
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,024
I am so happy
you wish to sit next to me,

250
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,906
because I have been watching you
walk down the aisle

251
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,785
and have the desire
to say a thing to you.

252
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,346
It is that you are
the first real, alive American girl

253
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,826
I have ever greeted in person.

254
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,630
You are so very beautiful.

255
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,268
I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one

256
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,940
if all the girls in America

257
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,468
are so beautiful and kind.

258
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,662
I don't think you're going to
have to worry about a thing.

259
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,059
Off.

260
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,862
- Wing flaps.
- Fifteen degrees.

261
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,582
- Mixture.
- Auto rich.

262
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,268
V1 and V2 speeds?

263
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,462
112, 116, that about does it.

264
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,546
- Check the radios, Dan?
- Yeah.

265
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,905
420 ready for takeoff.

266
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,505
Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.

267
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,906
When you have time, I wish you'd come
back and talk to one of my passengers.

268
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,065
All right.

269
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,658
He's a Mr Pardee,
big rumpled-looking man,

270
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,303
sitting halfway back on the right side.

271
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,944
Alsop said he had something to do
with the New York theatre.

272
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,788
I suppose he wants to put you
on the stage.

273
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,582
Call me
if you need your honour defended.

274
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,099
And jump from the frying pan
into the fire?

275
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,141
He's the original frightened Freddie.

276
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,024
Every time you bank or change
propeller pitch, he goes all white.

277
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,425
Grabs on his seat
like it was an electric chair.

278
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,983
Okay.

279
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,788
I thought you were
going to quit smoking.

280
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,470
I did. I haven't smoked
in three hours and 20 minutes.

281
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,262
Go ahead, stain your teeth.

282
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,105
Come see me when you grow up, junior.

283
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,985
What in the world are you
bawling about?

284
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,540
Have I done something to bring this on?

285
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,946
- Nell, cut it out.
- I'm trying to.

286
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,908
I just can't.

287
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,549
It's just, it's all over.

288
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,902
What's over?

289
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,098
Our honeymoon.

290
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,750
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

291
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,229
Of course it does. It's not over
for another 12 hours or so.

292
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,703
And it never has to be
as far as I'm concerned.

293
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,783
Oh, Milo.

294
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,419
I'm scared.

295
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,344
I'm just plain scared.

296
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,860
What are you scared of? We've got
the whole world in front of us.

297
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,585
It's just that we're so young.

298
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,501
And just like you said,

299
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,345
we've got that whole big world
down there.

300
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,181
- And you know what?
- What?

301
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,901
We've got to face it.

302
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,306
I thought you had confidence in me.

303
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,662
Of course I do.

304
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,943
It's just that

305
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,267
all the rest of the people in the world
don't know you like I do.

306
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,184
Supposing I was going to have a baby
and you didn't have a job?

307
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,868
- You're not supposed...
- Suppose I was?

308
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,025
All right.

309
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,499
You're going to have a baby
and I haven't got a job,

310
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,985
there's no food in the apartment,
it's snowing outside,

311
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,385
and the sheriff's knocking on the door...

312
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,589
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

313
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,826
- Are you?
- Am I what?

314
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,264
Are you...

315
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,459
You know.

316
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,828
- Me?
- You.

317
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,146
Oh, Milo. No.

318
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,945
Whatever gave you such an idea?

319
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,789
I don't know.

320
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,428
Prof. Flaherty. Welcome.

321
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,901
Are we to believe
you are at last resolved

322
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,590
to abandon the arts
and return to science?

323
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,900
If so, we rejoice.

324
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,860
We have sorely missed your help
and advice.

325
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,226
You're doing all right.

326
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,780
You'll find out how to blow up the world
all by your little selves.

327
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,944
It won't be long now and blooie.
Congratulations.

328
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,787
Professor, we all appreciate the fact
that you've been under enormous strain.

329
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,107
We deeply regret
that a man of your calibre

330
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,585
no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.

331
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,779
Cooperate?

332
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,544
I had a seat on a nice little campus

333
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,622
even if I wasn't making much money,

334
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,503
or my students didn't know
what I was talking about.

335
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,587
And I played pretty good golf

336
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,027
and I slept nights.

337
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,388
I was happy because I figured
it was still God's business

338
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,546
to monkey around with the universe.

339
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,301
He can fix a star
so it'll burn for a billion years.

340
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,740
Keep going and you'll find out
how to burn one up in a minute.

341
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,347
Did any of you ever bother
to look at the lagoon out there?

342
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,068
It's beautiful and blue,

343
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,508
and the people around it
are brown and kind

344
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,139
and they did know
how to laugh and sing.

345
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,989
Only now all the fishes
in the lagoon are dead.

346
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,900
And the people are scared forever.

347
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,268
They don't sing anymore.

348
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,946
You found a way to blow out a window

349
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,028
65 miles away from the impact point.

350
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,618
Only, suppose there's a mother

351
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,389
standing in that window
with a baby in her arms?

352
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,709
Professor,

353
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,862
I suggest you go to your tent
and rest for a while.

354
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,421
I'll arrange transport back to the States
for you at the earliest possible moment.

355
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,228
Yeah, do that.

356
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,579
I want to find a shepherd in the hills
or a mountain in the mist,

357
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,828
and paint their picture

358
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,463
before it's too late.

359
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,622
So, you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.

360
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,539
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

361
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,985
I've made almost 200 flights
across here

362
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,908
and I feel a lot safer
than if I were driving my car.

363
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,582
I've got a lovely wife and two kids,
another on the way.

364
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,099
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was safe.

365
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,028
You hedged, Captain.
You didn't answer my question.

366
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,105
Come now,

367
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,620
be a good honest fellow
and tell me exactly what frightened you?

368
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,938
They were technical incidents. I don't
think you'd understand, Mr Pardee.

369
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,583
I understand perfectly.

370
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,145
For some reason,
you were afraid you wouldn't reach

371
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,022
your Biblical span of life.

372
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,948
Which is precisely what's bothering me
at the moment.

373
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,982
I'm convinced I couldn't swim
from here to the nearest shore.

374
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,907
You won't have to swim, Mr Pardee.

375
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,305
Suppose one of your motors
ceases to function?

376
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,820
We'd just go back to Honolulu. These
ships fly beautifully on three engines.

377
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,225
If it should happen
beyond our point of no return

378
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,102
we'd simply continue
on to San Francisco.

379
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,506
Suppose two of your motors
became uninterested in further toil?

380
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,309
Each engine is entirely independent
of the other.

381
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,184
The chances of two quitting during the
same flight are one in several million.

382
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,505
Even if that should happen,
we could still fly,

383
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,586
lower and much slower,
but we'd get there.

384
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,908
You are very reassuring.
Why is it I read about so many crashes?

385
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,021
The newspapers always exaggerate
the importance of an air accident.

386
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,618
It would be very important to me
if I were in one.

387
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,342
You won't be, Mr Pardee.

388
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,903
Just relax. Enjoy your flight.

389
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,666
Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you
for just a minute.

390
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,060
It can only be a minute,
then I'll have to go back to work.

391
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,302
I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.

392
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,990
I used to work in reservations
for Pan American.

393
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,627
That's fine. I'm glad you decided
to try a flight with us.

394
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,504
Aren't there two exits to this plane?
One up forward,

395
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,188
where you
and the rest of the crew leave?

396
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,425
Yes.

397
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,548
Could I leave the plane that way?
With you and the crew?

398
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,021
Please, it's very important to me.

399
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,780
It's not what you're thinking.
I am going to be met in San Francisco,

400
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,300
but not by the police or anybody else
who could get you into trouble.

401
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,227
It just wouldn't work.

402
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,663
Confused, Captain?

403
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,978
Why, no. That's you.

404
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,107
It was me, eight years ago.

405
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,745
A fellow in the States saw that picture.

406
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,699
He wrote me.

407
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,947
I was lonely, so I answered.

408
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,307
There were a lot of letters,

409
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,663
beautiful letters.

410
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,423
And then last month,
I agreed to marry him.

411
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,306
I never got around to telling him
the picture was eight years old.

412
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,263
I don't want to bore you
with my troubles,

413
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,706
but that dream kept me sane
for a long time.

414
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,658
I know I'm a

415
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,499
mess.

416
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,860
I'm so much older than he thinks I am.

417
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,024
But

418
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,386
if I could just see him

419
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,185
and then leave without meeting him.

420
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,148
Please understand, Captain.

421
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,819
What you're asking
is not exactly in my line.

422
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,542
Let me think it over. I'll let you know.

423
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,702
- Newspaper?
- No, thanks.

424
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,901
- How's AT&T?
- It's up a point.

425
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,987
I hope you don't mind,
I couldn't help watching you.

426
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,019
You remind me so much of a man
I once knew.

427
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,662
My name is Ken Childs
and I don't mind at all.

428
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,506
Fourteen minutes behind
on the last fix, Skipper.

429
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,665
So?

430
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,384
We should make it up.
The wind seems to be shifting around.

431
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,579
Good.

432
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,622
You know it's nice having
a guy like Dan Roman up here.

433
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,350
For a change,
I don't feel like a grandfather.

434
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,826
I was just saying to my wife
the other day,

435
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,542
I never had it so good.

436
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,866
Easy job, no strain,

437
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,229
and I'm pretty lucky in having
a girl like Susie.

438
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,100
It makes all the difference in the world
what kind of a wife a guy has.

439
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,948
Don't you think so, Skipper?

440
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,550
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

441
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,062
I guess a lot of people
do think it's funny,

442
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,824
because I do the dishes
and the cooking, too,

443
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,029
but they forget
how much younger Susie is than I am.

444
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,865
And as for an extra martini
once in a while...

445
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,743
<i>And so you'll please forgive me
another question, Captain.</i>

446
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,420
<i>Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?</i>

447
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,987
...it's spirit.
You know, she once called me...

448
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,304
<i>Are you?</i>

449
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,699
<i>Are you now, for no reason at all...</i>

450
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,140
You wait till you see what she does
with that hardwood tray I bought her.

451
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,545
<i>...after almost 2 million miles...</i>

452
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,627
...maybe beside the little bar
she bought...

453
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,785
<i>...afraid?</i>

454
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,628
...to keep herself company
while I'm away.

455
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,547
She'll show it to everyone
who drops in

456
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,388
to keep her company when I'm away.

457
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,829
<i>But it's there.</i>

458
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,787
<i>It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.</i>

459
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,308
<i>You can almost touch it.</i>

460
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,741
She spent most of her time
riding around in it

461
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,462
so she wouldn't get too lonesome.

462
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,749
Guess she drove a little too fast...

463
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,385
<i>It's come like it has to so many others
for no reason at all...</i>

464
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,699
And besides...

465
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,981
<i>...except maybe the wear and tear
of those 2 million miles.</i>

466
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,148
...because they look like they're going
faster than they really are.

467
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,182
Like what the bartender told me
last December

468
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,938
when she was picked up
for being drunk in and about...

469
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,140
<i>They'll give you a certificate
for those 2 million miles</i>

470
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,306
<i>to hang on a wall at home.</i>

471
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,501
<i>Only, the certificate doesn't add up
to the wear and tear.</i>

472
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,828
...but the wrong word.
It's spirit she's got.

473
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,743
<i>Dan knows about it.</i>

474
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,790
<i>All the old timers say
it's only temporary,</i>

475
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,109
<i>like growing pains.</i>

476
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,188
Like this note she left me
on my last trip.

477
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,542
<i>And now, it's here for no reason at all,</i>

478
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,582
<i>and you've got to fight it,</i>

479
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,939
<i>all alone.</i>

480
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,545
"Welcome home, fatso.

481
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,389
"Got sleepy and couldn't wait
so you take a taxi.

482
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,906
"Don't make any racket when you come
home banging around the kitchen,

483
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,306
"and don't wake me up
in the morning. Love, Susie. "

484
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,869
What a sense of humour.

485
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,024
Someday, they're going to invent
a stool for navigators

486
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,948
that'll come somewhere near
fitting the human frame.

487
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,423
Ask Hobie if he can't synchronise
the props a little better.

488
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,666
I don't know
whether it's Number 1 or Number 3,

489
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,782
but one of them keeps slipping out.
It's getting on my nerves.

490
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,979
Okay.

491
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,822
Skipper says,
"What's the matter with you?

492
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,224
"Can't you keep the props together?"

493
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,669
They are together.

494
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,703
Skipper says they're out of phase.

495
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,786
One and 2 are as smooth as silk.

496
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,265
- So are 3 and 4.
- So be it.

497
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,779
The boys say the props
couldn't be smoother.

498
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,145
Yeah?

499
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,587
Well, there's something haywire.

500
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,707
Are you all right, Mr Briscoe?

501
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,145
All right?

502
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,548
Little girl,
I'm getting along like $10 million.

503
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,503
Can I get you something?

504
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,019
Perhaps a cup of tea
would taste good to you.

505
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,069
- What was that?
- It's 5:00.

506
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,867
- You mean it chimes?
- You heard it.

507
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,024
Funny thing. It happens to be
the last possession

508
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,618
I haven't signed over to someone else.

509
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,061
I wish it would chime again.

510
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,790
What a wonderful way
to keep track of the time.

511
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,107
If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait
for the next hour to come,

512
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,379
and then the next one.

513
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,229
You know something?
I used to feel the same way.

514
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,706
But right now I'm in no hurry
for the hours to pass.

515
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,659
No, the watch is yours.
I want you to have it.

516
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,145
- I couldn't think of accepting it.
- Please.

517
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,830
A watch is the last thing
I'm going to need.

518
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,744
I'd like to think of it
marking the kind of hours

519
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,667
only a young girl can have,

520
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,104
exciting hours.

521
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,030
You'll make me very happy
if you'll accept it.

522
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,420
Well, if you put it that way.

523
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,509
I can't thank you.

524
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,262
I've never met anyone like you,

525
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,950
yet I shall remember you
for the rest of my life.

526
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,062
I'd rather you remember
it's only a possession

527
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,306
and so, not worth very much.

528
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,261
I will, always.

529
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,906
We can hear it chime together again,
it needs setting, you know.

530
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,545
- It's 7:00 in San Francisco.
- Sure. I forgot.

531
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,586
Is it really 7:00, little girl?

532
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,348
As far as this aeroplane is concerned.

533
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,462
Then you know something?
I don't want tea or coffee.

534
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,344
- A glass of water?
- Water is for bathing,

535
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,463
but if you can put some Scotch in it,
I'll feel cleaner.

536
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,625
Yes, sir.

537
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,661
- It's way past my cocktail time.
- Right now.

538
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,862
How about my friend over there?
Will you join me for a drink, mister?

539
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,504
Yes, thank you very much.

540
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,505
That's awful nice music.

541
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,581
We picked up four minutes, Skipper.

542
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,940
Looks like that wind
is finally swinging around now.

543
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,105
Good.

544
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,541
I may pass a miracle
and hit San Francisco right on time.

545
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,905
- Have a Lifesaver, Skipper?
- No, thanks.

546
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,946
Let me know, will you, when we pass
the point of no return?

547
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,259
Naturally.

548
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,703
Lydia, if you're through pouting,

549
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,868
maybe we could try talking things over
in a reasonable manner.

550
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,060
We have nothing to talk over.

551
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:54,068
Anyone who would sell
a New York advertising agency

552
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,579
- for a broken-down mine in Canada...
- It isn't broken.

553
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,747
...just to make yourself feel important,
the big operator.

554
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,344
Operating on my money.

555
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,940
I just want to get up with the feeling
that anything I accomplish that day

556
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,503
is due to my own efforts.

557
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,144
Not because my wife happened
to inherit a business.

558
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,023
In three years I should be able
to pay you back. Every penny.

559
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,460
Three years in the wilderness
and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin

560
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,741
with my skirts around my ankles
when they ought to be around my knees

561
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,906
or the other way around.

562
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,983
For the last time, Lydia,
I'm asking you to come with me.

563
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,341
I'm glad it's the last time you're going
to make that insane request

564
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,347
so I won't have to say no again.

565
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,939
I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.

566
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,389
You're out of your head.

567
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,626
What am I supposed to do
while you clump around

568
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,342
in your boots and lumberjack shirt?

569
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,429
Have cocktails with the chipmunks?
Play bridge with the Eskimos?

570
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,108
Go on off to your primeval forest.
Play Daniel Boone,

571
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,506
get up with the pigeons or whatever
kind of birds they have up there.

572
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,063
Get calluses on your hands.

573
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,704
Be a great
dirt-under-the-fingernails boy.

574
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,867
Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.

575
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,108
Take a bath Saturday nights
and go to an Eskimo hoedown.

576
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,902
Teach them to samba, for all I care.

577
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,306
Do just as you please
if it will make you feel like a man.

578
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,503
Only don't ask me to share
your juvenile adventures.

579
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,940
It's bad enough having to pay for them.

580
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,626
- Is that your last word?
- No.

581
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,025
I've always felt your brain
would fit nicely in a demitasse.

582
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,942
Hey, fella.
You got nothing but trouble, right?

583
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,101
- I assure you...
- I know what you're going to say,

584
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,380
everything with you is hunky-dory.

585
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,343
That's the first thing a fella
in trouble always says.

586
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,419
The booby hatches are full of people
that keep things to themselves,

587
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,586
either because they're scared
to tell them the truth,

588
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,304
thinking they'll make a monkey
out of themselves,

589
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,149
or they figure no one else can
appreciate the situation they're in.

590
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,468
Okay?

591
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,508
Well, the Good Neighbours
believe that ain't so.

592
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,107
- And just who...
- A club I belong to back home.

593
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,229
It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.

594
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,742
Their luncheons are a riot.

595
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,346
Over the speaker's desk,
they've got a great big towel

596
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,065
with the letters "For Crying Out Loud"
embroidered on it.

597
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,149
And every member
has his own crying towel, get it?

598
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,429
When they bring in a bad case,
a couple of the Good Neighbours

599
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,940
hold the towel for the fella
so he can concentrate on weeping,

600
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,028
and then don't have to exert himself
in any other way.

601
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,468
It turns out to be a good
old-fashioned revival meeting

602
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,386
and the fella who has
no particular worries at the time,

603
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,383
he sort of feels left out of things.

604
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,146
And if this fella don't actually wind up
laughing at himself,

605
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,862
at least he feels better.

606
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,425
The main thing is, everybody does,

607
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,741
because nine times out of 10,

608
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,782
they think they're better off
than the other fella.

609
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,347
What do you sing at the end
of your meetings?

610
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,700
<i>Pack Up Your Troubles
in Your Old Kit Bag?</i>

611
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,058
How'd you guess?

612
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,899
When a fella comes in
with real trouble,

613
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,986
like he can't pay his income taxes,

614
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,863
or his wife just smashed up the car,

615
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,109
or his new house
shows cracks along the foundation,

616
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,629
they've got an organ that plays
real sad music.

617
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,389
It's a kick.

618
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,428
I can see how it might be.

619
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,707
Of course, a fella never comes in

620
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,908
with real troubles.

621
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,305
You know, like,

622
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,660
the guy's wife dying,

623
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,940
or his business really going broke.

624
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,585
They just confess little problems,

625
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,827
like who are they gonna get
to mow the lawn,

626
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,022
or will they ever break 100
on the golf course?

627
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,101
It's all relative, see.

628
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,219
You get the habit of laughing
at little problems

629
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,908
when they come along,

630
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,986
and then you don't blow your top

631
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,819
when the genuine,
serious things happen. Get it?

632
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,584
Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, Mr...

633
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,178
Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.

634
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,178
Getting back to your case,
maybe it'd make you feel better

635
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,948
if I cried some.

636
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,265
Then you'd understand
what the Good Neighbour means.

637
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,545
Imagine yourself with a towel.

638
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,019
Ready?

639
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,789
The wife and I scrimped
for over four years

640
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,628
to take a trip to Hawaii.

641
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:32,620
You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand,

642
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,302
things we ain't got at home.

643
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,225
We dreamed of the day
that we were to leave.

644
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,229
<i>So, the wife persuades a woman
to take care of our children</i>

645
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,908
<i>for $10 a day,</i>

646
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,023
<i>which is more than I made
the first five years we were married.</i>

647
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,428
<i>We got all unpacked
and were really living,</i>

648
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,307
<i>but the ship don't sail.
Strike or something.</i>

649
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,979
<i>But all right, we're lucky. We get
the last two tickets on an aeroplane,</i>

650
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,419
<i>and although we can't take
all our luggage,</i>

651
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,666
<i>we're in the land of our dreams.</i>

652
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,664
<i>At the little hotel that fits our budget,</i>

653
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,741
<i>there's a mix-up in the reservations.</i>

654
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,828
<i>Another couple named Joseph
from Milwaukee.</i>

655
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,987
<i>So we figure
maybe they've had a dream, too.</i>

656
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,146
<i>So we don't start any arguments.</i>

657
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,146
<i>We finally wind up at a hotel
which is way beyond our budget.</i>

658
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,942
<i>So we have to cut our trip short.</i>

659
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,466
<i>Okay? Comes evening,</i>

660
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,502
<i>the wife gets into the one evening dress
she could bring along</i>

661
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,508
<i>and I get into a tux
I haven't had on in 10 years.</i>

662
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,259
Mommy!

663
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,306
<i>We were ready for the light fantastic.</i>

664
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,028
<i>The wife was wearing new shoes</i>

665
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,983
<i>with heels much higher
than she was used to and...</i>

666
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,184
My back.

667
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,820
<i>The house doctor says the wife
has twisted her sacroiliac,</i>

668
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,504
<i>which ends the dancing for the trip.</i>

669
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,348
<i>So everything passes.</i>

670
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:36,145
<i>In a couple of days the wife is well
enough to hobble down to the beach.</i>

671
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,868
<i>It rains bullfrogs for three straight days.</i>

672
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,102
<i>All we got to do is sit around
and write postcards back home</i>

673
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,949
<i>about what a wonderful time
we're having.</i>

674
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:06,629
<i>Three days we got left,
then we meet the Wilsons.</i>

675
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,822
<i>One of the pleasures of any trip
should be the people you meet, right?</i>

676
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,589
<i>The Wilsons had their own ideas
of what was fun.</i>

677
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,749
<i>He thought my wife was his dish,
and she thought I was Clark Gable.</i>

678
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,308
<i>The wife can't run very fast
on account of her sacroiliac.</i>

679
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,022
<i>I'm having my own track meet.</i>

680
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,418
<i>Fella, you have never lived</i>

681
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:55,020
<i>until you've been chased around
the palm tree by that guy's wife.</i>

682
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,426
<i>So we spend the rest of our dream trip
eating away from the hotel</i>

683
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,429
<i>so we don't run into these people
and have to play post office all the time.</i>

684
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,704
<i>But the last day the sun comes out.</i>

685
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,220
<i>Whoever heard of coming home
from a dream trip without a tan?</i>

686
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:15,980
<i>We're desperate, see?
We really soaked up that sun, all day.</i>

687
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:25,228
The wife has a third-degree burn
on her shoulders.

688
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,942
I don't dare put any weight on my back.

689
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,226
I'm gonna have to borrow money
from the bank

690
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,899
to pay next month's food bill,
if we ever do get home.

691
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,589
If you still think you got troubles,
mister...

692
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,346
Wonder if you and Mrs Joseph
would care to join me in a drink?

693
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,305
You can have your towel back now.

694
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,984
Take a breather, Dan.
I'll turn the knobs awhile.

695
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,863
Good, I could use a little shuteye.

696
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,780
Funny thing how a fella can sleep with
four big engines hollering in his ears,

697
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,464
only wake up when they stop hollering.

698
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,464
Imagine silence
waking you up at home?

699
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,621
No human being should have to put up
with such an arrangement.

700
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,263
<i>San Francisco tollsman, 2930.</i>

701
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,506
I don't care if you did build
that radio yourself.

702
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:01,858
It's against the law.

703
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,548
Throw it overboard before I do.

704
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,982
But I like to listen to the aeroplanes.
I spent a long time building that set.

705
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:12,026
You touch my set and I'll kill you.
I might do it anyway.

706
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,029
Just to have something happen
on this rust bucket.

707
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,108
You're going off your rocker.
You need six months ashore.

708
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,423
Being shipmates with you is enough
to drive anybody off their rocker.

709
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,029
Get out of here.

710
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,829
Don't say I didn't warn you.

711
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,588
The FCC will jerk your licence
in a minute

712
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,940
if you send anything on that pile of junk.

713
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,219
Get out of here.

714
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,899
<i>Hello, Honolulu.
This is 420 with a position report.</i>

715
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,305
Come on, Honolulu. Wake up.
Answer him.

716
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,500
<i>420, this is San Francisco,</i>

717
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,303
<i>Honolulu unable to read you
on account of poor conditions.</i>

718
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,029
<i>Go ahead with your report.</i>

719
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,142
<i>Okay, San Francisco. Copy, Honolulu.</i>

720
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,386
<i>Position at 0557.</i>

721
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,546
<i>Latitude 34/30 north.</i>

722
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,460
<i>Longitude 140 west, 9,000 feet.</i>

723
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,265
<i>1,500 gallons remaining.</i>

724
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:20,821
<i>From the window at my side,
sometimes I can see the stars.</i>

725
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,066
<i>America is all around me in every way.</i>

726
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,379
<i>Do you understand a funny thing?</i>

727
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,508
<i>In Honolulu, I must be inspected</i>

728
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,384
<i>by the American customs
and immigration persons.</i>

729
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,703
<i>And not one soldier to guard things.</i>

730
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,547
<i>I look everywhere for soldiers
with guns and...</i>

731
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,861
Would you like your dinner now,
Miss Chen?

732
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,221
Yes. Please, I am so stupid.

733
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,023
Here is a letter to my brother in English

734
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,186
and I cannot remember this word.

735
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,704
It is that thing soldiers wear
at the end of their guns,

736
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,305
like a sword?

737
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,022
- Bayonet?
- Yes.

738
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,701
I am so very stupid. Thank you.

739
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,903
I am embarrassed.

740
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,464
Anyone who can write and read
more than one language

741
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,103
should never be embarrassed.

742
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,983
Being the original dumb-bunny,
I can barely write my own.

743
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,099
"Dumb-bunny"?

744
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,267
That's slang for mentally-retarded
American girls like me.

745
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,909
Dumb-bunny.

746
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,941
How delightful.
I must tell my brother of this.

747
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,064
You tell him you met the number one
stupid rabbit.

748
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,624
If he knows any American girls,
he'll understand.

749
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,342
Now I'll get your dinner.

750
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,863
Dumb-bunny.

751
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,865
There's something very wrong
back there. The tray...

752
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,628
- I know.
- A whole tray jumped.

753
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,503
- I burned myself.
- I swear it's that Number 1 engine.

754
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,982
It was running perfectly. They all are.

755
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,978
Maybe it's in the tail. If our little girl got
burned, maybe it's worse back there.

756
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,578
Dan, take your flashlight,
have a look through the tail.

757
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,587
- Report to me as soon as you can.
- Right.

758
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,382
Leonard, take a fast fix,

759
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,149
let me know our position now
and every 10 minutes from now.

760
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,783
Spalding, get back to your passengers.

761
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,265
If this thing lets go again,
they'll start wondering.

762
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,109
Hobie, tell San Francisco
we're experiencing

763
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,028
some unusual vibration
and to stand by until further advised.

764
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:45,380
Do you want to declare an emergency?

765
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,669
No, not yet.

766
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,310
- Is everything all right?
- We're still in one piece.

767
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,149
I was just starting to serve
the passengers. Should I go ahead?

768
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,589
You might as well.

769
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,178
Sometimes these things
never do get explained.

770
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,982
Say, hang up a minute, will you?

771
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,101
Tell me what's wrong
with this aeroplane.

772
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:05,142
- Is there something wrong with it?
- Cut it out.

773
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:08,262
Something popped so hard a while ago,
it spilled my drink.

774
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,510
Order another. We're not stingy.

775
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,143
You won't talk?

776
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,620
I would if there was anything to say.

777
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,705
I'll make you a bet right now,
we're late getting into San Francisco.

778
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,618
Could be.

779
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,783
- Did you find anything?
- Nope.

780
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,549
- What do you suppose it could it be?
- Beats me. Where are we?

781
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,501
I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.

782
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,063
Nothing wrong with the tail.

783
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:42,899
The Number 1 head temperature has
gone up five degrees in the past hour.

784
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,785
San Francisco wants to know
the nature of our trouble.

785
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,821
Tell them if we knew,
we'd have told them.

786
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,622
No, don't say that. Tell them...

787
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,945
Just say we still don't know
and to keep standing by.

788
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,346
I got news for you guys.
We just passed the point of no return.

789
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,544
- Have you lost something, Mr Agnew?
- My lighter is out of fluid.

790
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,022
Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship

791
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,710
and is trying to work up an appetite
for dinner.

792
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,187
I seen a crazy man act like that once.
It ain't so nice.

793
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,062
He's looking for trouble.

794
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,824
You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?
Well, isn't that your name?

795
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,302
Yeah. Why?
I don't think we've met before.

796
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:51,388
No. We've not met
because no one wanted us to.

797
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,622
What can I do for you?

798
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,746
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

799
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,106
Well, does that mean anything to you?

800
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,584
- Agnew. You're Martha's husband.
- I am.

801
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,062
I didn't hear you say
you were pleased to meet me.

802
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,661
- Of course...
- Of course not!

803
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,620
Look, Mr Agnew, this lady and I
are having a quiet drink together.

804
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,542
You seem to be disturbed
about something.

805
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,865
Perhaps we can talk later.
If you'll excuse...

806
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,380
No, you don't just snap your fingers
and send me on my way.

807
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:30,666
Mr Agnew, I don't know what's
eating you, and frankly, I don't care.

808
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,702
Why don't you go back
wherever you came from and sit down.

809
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,549
- Now, honey.
- This man's a nuisance.

810
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,707
I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.

811
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,661
I must have been
an even greater nuisance

812
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,668
when you and my wife were scheming
to avoid me in Honolulu,

813
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:46,702
- so you could be alone.
- You're right out of your head.

814
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:51,020
I took your wife to lunch twice
because she was a very nice girl.

815
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,270
And a long time ago
she happened to work for me.

816
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,149
The worst crime she is guilty of
is shaking my hand.

817
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:00,746
Now stop insulting her
and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.

818
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,583
I knew you'd have
some fancy explanation.

819
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,060
But I'm not such a fool
as you and my wife think I am.

820
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,700
I'm going to let you wonder
what I'm going to do.

821
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:14,505
Wonder and think and think,
as I've been doing.

822
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,066
I've heard about you for years
and I'm sick of the sound of your name.

823
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,619
You're quite a conqueror
with the ladies, aren't you?

824
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,661
That should interest you, madam.

825
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,907
- I've had enough of this.
- What's the matter with you guys?

826
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,146
- Hey, what's this all about?
- Easy, break it up.

827
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,783
He's crazy, he's got a gun.

828
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,942
We're on fire!

829
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:47,548
- Pull the bottle on it.
- Hobie, pull the bottle quick!

830
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:56,300
- Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco.
- San Francisco 420.

831
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,902
The prop! The whole prop is gone.

832
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,588
Yes, and you may lose your engine, too.

833
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,224
- She's off her mountings.
- Pull the other bottle, Dan.

834
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:08,387
- I'm starting for the water.
- San Francisco 420.

835
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,385
Thank you, sweet Lord.

836
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,546
I don't think she's gonna burn any more.

837
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,228
I can't raise San Francisco. Static.

838
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,341
- Try the secondary frequency.
- I've tried both.

839
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:30,222
Use emergency.
Give them a mayday call.

840
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,829
- Are we going into the water?
- No.

841
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,906
She flies lousy
with that engine hanging down,

842
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:35,383
but I think we can stay in the air.

843
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,148
- How long to the coast?
- Six hours, about.

844
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,546
But at regular cruising speed. I've not
figured it out for this sort of thing.

845
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,785
Figure it!

846
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:42,979
...mayday 420.

847
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,585
Mayday 420, anybody.

848
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,108
I got somebody. A ship.

849
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:54,826
<i>This is the Cristobal Trader calling 420.
I can hear you very clearly.</i>

850
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,108
You passed right over me
about 20 minutes ago.

851
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:01,267
Do you want me to relay
all your messages? Over.

852
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:05,099
Roger. Advise San Francisco
we've lost Number 1 propeller.

853
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,067
Fire started but is now out.

854
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,505
We are now at 5,000, but sinking.

855
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:12,508
Request they clear
all altitudes below us. Over.

856
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,228
Will do. Stand by.

857
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,587
<i>This is Cristobal Trader
calling San Francisco.</i>

858
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:49,143
Clear sea rescue from Oakland Control.

859
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:55,545
Right.

860
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,705
<i>Warm up the ready plane. Intercept.</i>

861
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,028
San Francisco wants to know
if you are going to ditch. Over.

862
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,265
Negative for now.

863
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,029
What's the state of the sea
about you, just in case. Over.

864
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:35,540
Heavy northwest swells.
We are rolling about 30 degrees.

865
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,106
It's very rough.
Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.

866
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,579
It's wet down here. Over.

867
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,985
<i>Thank you, Cristobal Trader. We'll try.</i>

868
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,063
Attaboy, papa.

869
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,945
Some of these days, I'm gonna
get smart and go back to buttons.

870
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:57,026
- What's the poop?
- Eastbound lost a prop.

871
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,505
Had a fire but that's out.
Looks like he's headed for the drink.

872
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,427
- How far out is he?
-1,000 miles maybe.

873
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,903
My aching eyes!

874
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,669
This might well be my last show
and not a laugh in it.

875
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,385
I shouldn't have screamed,
but I was so scared.

876
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,104
My own heart is just returning
from the ceiling.

877
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,786
Troubles? Wait till I tell
the Good Neighbours about this.

878
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:36,226
I was almost asleep when someone
pulled the champagne cork.

879
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,749
This could become interesting.

880
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,464
Things were pretty interesting
before this happened.

881
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,228
Two apes were trying to kill each other.

882
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,705
Why don't you be a good boy
and go back and sit down.

883
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:46,548
I'm sure everything will be all right.

884
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,628
They'll come back from the flight deck
and explain in a minute.

885
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,822
I'm just gonna keep this for you
till we make San Francisco.

886
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,259
You can get in plenty trouble
with them things.

887
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,460
I'll get coffee for everyone.

888
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,382
Did you know space guns don't kill you?

889
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,499
No.

890
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,268
They just make you stiff.

891
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:20,385
You know, the funny part of all this,

892
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,786
is that for the first time
in my whole life, I'm innocent.

893
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:27,742
What I told him was the truth,
so help me.

894
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,944
This is gonna cost the taxpayers
a lot of money.

895
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:41,901
What would you have them do?
Swim home?

896
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,942
No Alameda, this is the Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Centre.

897
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,583
- New position, Skipper!
- Name it!

898
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,543
To the coast, 5 hours, 47 minutes,
if we can hold this air speed.

899
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,582
- How's our fuel?
- Enough. Just.

900
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,501
We'll only need about 1,150 gallons,
we've 1,300 according to my graph.

901
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:44,303
- It's pinching things close...
- You can throw your graph away.

902
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:47,228
- Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.
- How do you figure that?

903
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:51,389
The Number 1 tank. It read 200 gallons
when we lost our prop.

904
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,905
My guess is that when the prop left us,

905
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,339
it kicked holes in the wing.
Ruptured the tank.

906
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:00,383
We just can't make it this way.
I'll figure it up again, but the winds,

907
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,229
- maybe they'll change some.
- We're going into the drink.

908
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,341
It's just a question of when and where.

909
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,258
We've got plenty of time. Let's not rush
off into the heat of the day about this.

910
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,381
Let's hold on a while
and see what the wind does.

911
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,024
- We'll be closer to the coast.
- Water will be colder there.

912
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:18,348
And probably rougher, but I still think we
should stretch it out as long as we can.

913
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,585
I'll go along with you on that.

914
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:22,065
It'll give us more time
to get squared away.

915
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,909
I want you up here with me
when we really start down.

916
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:26,702
Meantime get everything
you can overboard.

917
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,549
Thousand pounds or so
will make a difference in our speed.

918
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:32,503
You want me to tell them
they're going into the drink?

919
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,662
Use your own judgement.

920
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,344
I guess I don't have to tell you people
that we've had a little trouble.

921
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,821
Maybe if I explain
exactly what has happened,

922
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:12,464
you'll feel better all around.

923
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,864
I'm not gonna minimise it,

924
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:17,824
nor will I make it any tougher
than it really is.

925
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,749
We've lost our Number 1 propeller.

926
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:44,141
This is just one of those things
that never happens but does

927
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,545
once in a billion flying miles.

928
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,584
We've extinguished the fire
with the carbon dioxide,

929
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,860
so there's no further danger from that.

930
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,982
But our speed has been considerably
slowed down

931
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:58,859
because the Number 1 motor
is partially twisted in its mountings,

932
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,947
causing a severe drag,

933
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:04,142
sort of like dragging your feet
in a rowboat.

934
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,861
I can't blame you
if you are a little scared, I am, too.

935
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,944
I've been flying since 1917

936
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:17,142
and I don't like this sort of thing
any better than you do.

937
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,899
However, with all that flying,
you'll notice that

938
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,066
I'm still very much alive.

939
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,428
Now comes the hard part.

940
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:31,982
- Can you take it?
- Please, tell us everything.

941
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,428
I think we all want to know.

942
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,584
We're really very lucky.

943
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:56,066
That propeller could have done
a great deal more damage.

944
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:01,222
Anyway, there are several holes in
the wing, that's where our fuel is stored.

945
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,459
Which means that we can't quite make
the California coast.

946
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:09,428
Can't we go back to Honolulu?

947
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:12,747
We'd already past the point
of no return when it happened.

948
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,668
We will probably have to ditch
this plane in the sea.

949
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:18,350
We'll all be killed.

950
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,786
There's just a chance that you'll only be
in the water a few minutes.

951
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,788
There's a rescue plane
already on its way to intercept us.

952
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:30,425
Before we actually have to go in
there'll probably be several more.

953
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,427
Some of which can land on water.

954
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,861
And surface vessels
will be directed toward us.

955
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:41,745
Aeroplanes have gone
into the water before

956
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:45,505
and no one received the slightest injury,
except maybe a little dampening.

957
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:48,226
Casualties come from panic.

958
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,542
So you must not hurry.

959
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:54,663
Miss Spalding and our second officer,
Mr Wheeler, will be back here with you.

960
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,826
Do exactly as they tell you.

961
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:00,939
Aeroplanes have been known to float
for so long that

962
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:04,858
they became a menace to navigation
and had to be sunk by gunfire.

963
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:07,788
They've been known to sink
in a few minutes, too.

964
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,061
This is an inflatable life raft.

965
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,418
It's really a wonderful gadget.

966
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,780
It's got everything in it
but T-bone steaks.

967
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,987
It will hold all of you very comfortably.

968
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:31,704
Mr Wheeler, our second officer,
will be in charge.

969
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,219
He will tell you
when to take off your shoes.

970
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,466
We don't want anybody kicking holes
in this raft.

971
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:39,627
Miss Spalding will show you
where the emergency rations are,

972
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,785
when you get hungry.

973
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:44,107
How're we gonna get hungry if we're
only gonna be in the raft a few minutes?

974
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,948
Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?

975
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,948
Maybe a little,
but we just don't want bad things said

976
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:51,630
about the service
and cuisine on this airline.

977
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,342
No doubt there'll be caviar.

978
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:56,109
It would be most arduous
if there were no caviar.

979
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:58,340
I'll speak to the emergency chef.

980
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,426
I don't think
this is anything to joke about.

981
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,859
You're wrong.
The more jokes, the better.

982
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,022
When you get in that raft,
you might even try singing.

983
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,386
I was once a fair-to-middling bass.

984
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:11,661
I can't carry a tune in a basket,
but I'm sure loud.

985
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,421
Now, this is very important.

986
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:17,269
When we actually go in,
there will be two shocks.

987
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:20,423
If you know about them in advance,
they won't frighten you.

988
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,781
The first will be hardly noticeable,
like a normal landing.

989
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,942
But the second may be quite severe,
so brace yourselves.

990
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:29,227
Soon after that, the lights will go out,

991
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:32,387
but Miss Spalding and Mr Wheeler
both have flashlights.

992
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:35,821
So unfasten your seat belts
and wait for his call.

993
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,509
And keep calm.

994
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,259
Now, is there anything
you don't understand?

995
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,346
Could we send a radio message
to our families?

996
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:45,382
They were gonna meet us at the airport.
They will be standing.

997
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,785
I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy

998
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:50,629
giving our position
and contacting the rescue plane.

999
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,140
I've some important papers
in my briefcase, many years of work.

1000
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,828
Can I take them with me?

1001
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:58,265
Not unless you can stuff them
in your pockets.

1002
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,267
No baggage of any kind.

1003
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,308
Come to think about it,

1004
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:05,069
the bottom of the sea
is the best place for them.

1005
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,945
And one thing more.
Now, don't get your hopes up.

1006
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:13,786
There is one chance in a thousand
that we can make the coast.

1007
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,987
This isn't possible unless there is
a marked change in the wind.

1008
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,943
And according to our forecast,
it just couldn't happen.

1009
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:24,063
But it could. And the one thing
we can do right now to help matters

1010
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,626
is to lighten ship.
That way we'll use slightly less fuel.

1011
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:32,549
If any of you gentlemen have ever had
an urge to throw things out of windows,

1012
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,860
this is your chance of a lifetime.

1013
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,789
What about us girls?
I love to throw things.

1014
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,026
Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.

1015
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:46,224
I'd better stick with the wife. She's
awfully worried about our children.

1016
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,143
Please, let me help.

1017
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:51,388
I'll sue the airline for this,
I'm not supposed to exert myself.

1018
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:54,946
- The doctor says my heart...
- Your heart is breaking my heart.

1019
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,740
We can get rid of some of this baggage
if you gentlemen will come with me,

1020
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,180
and the rest of you
form a line clear back to the door.

1021
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:02,780
My new Mainbocher frock is in here.

1022
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:05,299
The insurance company
isn't gonna like this.

1023
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,549
What a wonderful excuse
to get a new wardrobe.

1024
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:36,546
Be kind of nice
if he came through all this

1025
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:38,828
and didn't know a thing about it.

1026
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:41,982
I need a big man.

1027
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,659
Interested?

1028
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,862
- Fascinated.
- Grab me around the waist.

1029
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,463
All right, start kicking things out,
but be careful.

1030
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:11,818
Keep behind me,
it's lonesome out there.

1031
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:18,983
That does it.

1032
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:26,501
Now all we have to do is wait.

1033
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,138
Excuse me.

1034
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:46,100
My kids, they like to hear me play this.

1035
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:28,582
- Aren't you coming back to our seat?
- I'm staying here.

1036
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:30,905
I can't stand that crying towel.

1037
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,786
Hobie, give me 2,250 rpm.

1038
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:43,029
Crack the cowl flaps.
Watch those head temperatures.

1039
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,067
Give me another inch of boost!

1040
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:53,223
Look at the fuel, Skipper,
the flow meters, we're pouring it in.

1041
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:57,502
I can't help it. This turbulence is slowing
us down and we can't climb out of it!

1042
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,903
Have a cup of coffee.

1043
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,741
- I'm plenty hot enough now.
- Then it will cool you off.

1044
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:26,350
Of course you're worried, Mrs Joseph.

1045
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:29,268
But I'm quite certain
we'll get out of this all right.

1046
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:32,939
By tomorrow we can look back on it
as an interesting experience.

1047
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,708
By the by, how old are your children?

1048
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,546
Jennifer is six and Edward is four.

1049
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:44,868
Jennifer is such a delightful name,
Mrs Joseph. How fortunate you are.

1050
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:50,222
Jennifer has always brought to me
the suggestion of the Scottish moor,

1051
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:53,863
heather, great peace,

1052
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:57,342
and visions of little villages
nestled against the hills.

1053
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,622
That sort of thing.

1054
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:02,140
Is your Jennifer anything like that?

1055
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:06,669
I don't know exactly what you mean,
but she's always been a quiet child.

1056
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,905
Precisely.

1057
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:11,108
Somehow I knew your Jennifer
would be like that.

1058
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:15,024
And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing
so fast you can't buy shoes for him.

1059
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,508
Every three weeks.

1060
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:22,066
Why don't you try to rest now?

1061
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,627
Later I'd like to hear
a great deal more about your children.

1062
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,585
I thought you hated
the mere mention of children.

1063
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:38,938
I do.

1064
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:42,460
But that poor woman is terrified.
I think I helped her.

1065
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:47,100
For 10 years you've said that
love was a word in the dictionary

1066
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,221
and children were monsters.

1067
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:52,626
And you would never go two inches
out of your way to help anybody.

1068
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,820
What goes, Gustave?

1069
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:00,187
I've never seen you this way.

1070
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,744
You've forgotten yourself
for a whole hour.

1071
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,703
You've been magnificent.

1072
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,949
Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence.

1073
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:12,942
You told that woman
we'd get out of this all right.

1074
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,947
- Do you really believe that?
- No.

1075
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:19,428
In spite of what that pilot said, I think
we're batting at a very sticky wicket.

1076
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:22,628
- And yet you're not afraid?
- Yes and no.

1077
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,028
I'm not sure just how I feel.

1078
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:29,180
If I were openly afraid now,
some of the others might become so.

1079
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:33,499
I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics
right after the fire

1080
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:35,746
and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.

1081
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,946
I just want to know one thing.

1082
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:41,750
What happened to the biggest baby
in the world?

1083
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:45,062
The child-man who was afraid to sleep
with the lights off.

1084
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:48,387
You used to burst into tears
if the laundry put starch in your shirts,

1085
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,580
or the crepe suzette was underdone.

1086
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:55,542
I don't understand you, Gustave.
I guess I never will.

1087
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:59,378
Maybe it isn't important
to understand you

1088
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:04,425
like the other women
you've always managed to keep around.

1089
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:10,868
I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain
with a throwback, a Roman emperor.

1090
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:16,299
You bought me on the market, Gustave,
paid for me,

1091
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,900
like you might pay for a play
which you thought might turn out well.

1092
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:26,786
For 10 years I've lived with that thought
and hated it.

1093
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,946
Now it'll never bother me again.

1094
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:40,619
Gustave, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

1095
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:45,346
And if we don't get out of this,
I'd like you to know it even more.

1096
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:49,060
I've never said it before

1097
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:52,429
and probably you'll never want me
to say it again.

1098
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:55,223
What else is on your twisted little mind?

1099
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,342
I'm in love with you, Gustave.

1100
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:06,700
I guess I always have been.

1101
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,300
And then you tie the ribbons like this.

1102
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:21,425
These preservers are not inflated now.

1103
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:24,224
If you jerk this cord on either side,

1104
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,625
carbon dioxide will be released
from the capsules

1105
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,581
and the vest will inflate immediately.

1106
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:29,904
That's all there is to it.

1107
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:34,590
- Any calls for me?
- Take your pick.

1108
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,422
Boyd, public relations.

1109
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:40,589
No, Tommy.
We've not lost an aeroplane.

1110
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,220
I'm standing right here in Operations
and our plane is still in the air.

1111
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:47,865
Yeah, we had a little trouble. No,
I don't know the passengers' names.

1112
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:49,821
Yeah, okay.

1113
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:53,067
Where's Garfield? This jerk newspaper
wants a statement from the manager.

1114
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:55,499
He's on his way.
He'll be here any minute.

1115
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:57,427
Boyd, public relations.

1116
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:01,180
Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown
over 30 million passenger miles

1117
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:03,266
without ever scratching a passenger.

1118
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,062
Sure we want to cooperate.

1119
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:08,182
You'll get the straight dope,
just give me time to get organised.

1120
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,902
Goodbye.

1121
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,748
Mr Garfield, can you give me a minute?

1122
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:13,588
Just about. What's your trouble?

1123
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:16,304
The papers are on my neck already.
What will I tell them?

1124
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:18,307
How about "drop dead" for an opener?

1125
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:21,069
- You know I can't do that.
- I know.

1126
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:23,784
- How long can you stall them?
- I don't know, maybe an hour.

1127
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:25,707
They're crying about morning editions.

1128
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:28,503
An hour might be enough.
We've got real trouble.

1129
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:31,061
Does it look that bad?

1130
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,668
It don't look good.

1131
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,628
Is everything all right with you two?

1132
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:46,186
I don't know when I've felt better
in the last five years.

1133
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:51,107
I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl I
would most like to be on a life raft with.

1134
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,547
Of course, now,
she may prefer a younger man.

1135
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,065
There is in my family a very old saying.

1136
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:09,384
I will try to translate it for you.

1137
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:14,665
"The youth of man will never die

1138
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:17,346
"unless he murders it. "

1139
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:20,182
I plead not guilty.

1140
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:23,983
I just want to show you
how to use your life vest.

1141
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,261
My neck won't stand any weight,

1142
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:30,427
and my bones are only held together
by my imagination.

1143
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:33,223
A burial at sea will save my heirs
a lot of money.

1144
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:37,186
- I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.
- Why do that?

1145
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:40,148
You just look more comfortable
that way, Mr Briscoe.

1146
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:44,026
You impress me
as the open-collar type anyway.

1147
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,704
Rugged, you know.

1148
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:47,468
- Outdoorsy, you mean?
- Yes.

1149
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,463
You behave yourself.

1150
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:52,468
I'll be coming back to make sure
you're being nice to Miss Chen.

1151
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:56,060
It's a rough assignment
for an outdoor man without his horse,

1152
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,181
but I'll do my best.

1153
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:01,460
Would you like
to put your vests on now?

1154
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:06,543
Investigation will undoubtedly prove this
aeroplane was ready for the junk heap.

1155
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,867
And we're in the hands of incompetents.

1156
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:12,903
I don't want to make no trouble,
but why don't you shut up?

1157
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:14,349
You hate me, don't you?

1158
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:16,984
All of you hate me
because I tried to do what was right.

1159
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:19,226
Do like the little lady says.

1160
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,341
Don't touch me, please.

1161
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:24,780
You're giving me a very bad time,
Mr Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.

1162
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:26,025
I have a perfect right...

1163
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:29,142
You got no rights at all
for some time to come.

1164
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:33,987
Do like she says or no life vest
is gonna keep you from drowning

1165
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:37,819
because I'm gonna hold your head
under till you stop wiggling.

1166
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:44,386
If we should happen to go down,
I'll give you plenty of warning.

1167
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:47,547
Cross your arms like this
right in front of your face.

1168
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,310
Brace your hands
on the seat just ahead.

1169
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,979
Bend your head down
between your arms,

1170
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:55,863
and keep them there
until we've stopped completely.

1171
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,028
Remember to remove your shoes.

1172
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:00,186
You men should loosen
your collar and tie.

1173
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:01,663
Why?

1174
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:03,667
According to the ditching instructions,

1175
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:06,350
there is less possibility
of breaking your neck.

1176
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:18,949
Anything from 420?

1177
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:21,307
Not a sound out of them, sir.

1178
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:25,298
Those people,
if they have to ditch tonight

1179
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:27,864
with the way that wind's
kicking up that sea,

1180
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,585
they don't stand much of a chance,
I'm thinking.

1181
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,947
<i>Cristobal Trader from San Francisco.</i>

1182
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:46,301
<i>We can work the aircraft clearly now.
Thanks for your help. Over.</i>

1183
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:48,148
<i>Good. Muchas gracias.</i>

1184
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:52,219
<i>Cristobal Trader over and out.</i>

1185
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,827
How about letting me take over
for a while? Save yourself for later.

1186
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,622
- We'll need you.
- All right.

1187
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:37,308
Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.

1188
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:41,184
Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left. But if the
winds are right we can make it.

1189
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:44,508
We picked up four minutes
in the past hour. I figured it all out.

1190
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:47,428
If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes,
we're safe.

1191
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:49,984
Hey, Skipper,
the interceptor is calling us.

1192
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:56,025
We estimate our position
at 145 miles east of you.

1193
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:59,307
Expect interception
in approximately 20 minutes.

1194
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:00,869
Get a bearing on him.

1195
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:07,149
We will transmit every three minutes
from now on.

1196
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:10,785
When your needle begins to
fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.

1197
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:13,180
We will then be very close to you.

1198
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,941
You should have a bearing by now.
How about it?

1199
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:23,989
We're gonna make it.

1200
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:29,819
Five degrees north of our course.
We're awful glad to know you're around.

1201
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:34,267
We know what you mean.
Say, can you guys climb any higher?

1202
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:36,819
Out of this stuff
interception would be a lot easier.

1203
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:40,101
Negative. We can climb, but we don't
want to use the fuel to do it.

1204
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:42,141
Every gallon's a mile nearer shore
for us.

1205
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:45,028
Okay. We'll find you anyway.

1206
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:10,748
- Are you still afraid?
- No, my darling.

1207
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:16,869
I don't mean the aeroplane.
I mean us, our future.

1208
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:19,747
I'm not afraid of anything now.

1209
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,303
I can't hear you.

1210
01:34:23,910 --> 01:34:27,141
How could I ever be afraid
when you hold me like this?

1211
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:31,062
- I love you.
- Darling.

1212
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:45,419
No.

1213
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:50,301
Just think where we are.

1214
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,739
I'm thinking how awful it would be

1215
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,589
if this was the last time
I could hold you so.

1216
01:34:56,590 --> 01:35:00,822
- We'll have years, all our lives.
- If this aeroplane makes it.

1217
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:04,910
Careful, darling.

1218
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,259
Howard.

1219
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:26,825
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

1220
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,785
Would you be sorry if I drowned?

1221
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:34,218
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I have to know.

1222
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:38,827
I'd be more than sorry.

1223
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,544
You could go off to your North woods.

1224
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:48,142
It's occurred to me
that trying to make a go at that mine

1225
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:50,545
might turn out to be a bad dream.

1226
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:53,749
But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.

1227
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:56,259
It was.

1228
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:02,065
I could switch things back.
I suppose that would please you.

1229
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,942
I'd only lose you.

1230
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:09,102
A few hours ago,
you insisted on getting rid of me.

1231
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:17,259
At times I'm a very stupid
and selfish woman.

1232
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:22,458
I think you should go up to your mine.

1233
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:24,304
That's you.

1234
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,510
And you might take me along for laughs.

1235
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:31,028
I'm hearing things.

1236
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,828
You'd be miserable.

1237
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:35,464
No doubt.

1238
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,183
But I want you.

1239
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:41,299
The guy I had sense enough to marry.

1240
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:47,821
If I choke on hotcakes, or try to put
evening gowns on the natives,

1241
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:53,589
or have cocktails with the sled dogs,
you'll just have to be patient with me.

1242
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:57,864
You don't have to, but I wish you would.

1243
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:03,985
Mush! That's what you say
to a sled dog, isn't it?

1244
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:06,626
I want to start practising.

1245
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:13,262
Makes them turn left,
if you yell it loud enough.

1246
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:17,941
You're very good.

1247
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:25,267
- Can you get that through to Sullivan?
- I can try.

1248
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:27,984
- Everything else buttoned up?
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:34,026
- Any improvement in the local weather?
- I'm afraid not.

1250
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:53,709
- Radar, anything yet?
- No target, sir.

1251
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:57,422
Navigator, how's our position
for interception?

1252
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:59,746
Dead on. Just got a loran fix.

1253
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,708
We should be joining now,
if their navigator is anywhere near right.

1254
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:16,946
- Radar?
- No target, sir.

1255
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:20,068
- Somebody's wrong.
- We should be right on top of them.

1256
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:24,659
We can easily miss this guy.

1257
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,223
No target, sir.

1258
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:34,385
That navigator's wacky.
We're already seven minutes overdue.

1259
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:36,899
Radar?

1260
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:41,465
Target, Skipper. Strong blip.
Four degrees left, eight miles.

1261
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:43,303
Looks like he's 500 feet below us.

1262
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:01,182
<i>Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?</i>

1263
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:05,307
What happened to the 11 minutes
you were counting on?

1264
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:07,620
What happened to them, fatso?

1265
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:10,464
You never could make them up,
you just thought you could.

1266
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:15,459
- Lennie, what about it?
- Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.

1267
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:28,699
Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.

1268
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:32,787
Find the minutes,
and you can come back to me.

1269
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:35,268
Minutes.

1270
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:37,747
Who's got the minutes?

1271
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:40,304
Your Susie's got them, right here.

1272
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:44,906
Come on, Lennie.
What's holding things up?

1273
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:47,464
The Coast Guard says
your position's wrong.

1274
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:49,740
I'll be right with you, Skipper.

1275
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:59,464
Skipper?

1276
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,103
I got bad news.

1277
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:08,781
The Coast Guard was right.
I made a dumb kid's mistake.

1278
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:12,906
We're not as close to the coast
as I thought we were.

1279
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:15,669
I was figuring in knots instead of miles.

1280
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:18,426
I guess I was just scared.

1281
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:20,302
What about those 11 minutes?

1282
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:23,342
They can make the difference
between the water and your own bed.

1283
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:24,983
They aren't there.

1284
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:27,702
They never were there.

1285
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:30,422
I'm sorry, Skipper.

1286
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,907
I hope this will float.

1287
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:10,823
<i>I am so excited about your arrival,
Sally.</i>

1288
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:14,859
<i>Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains
and pines, which will be your home, too,</i>

1289
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:18,505
<i>and go down to the city
for my first visit in over a year.</i>

1290
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,299
<i>I want to get there
a few days before you arrive,</i>

1291
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,705
<i>because there are some things
this cabin needs</i>

1292
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,390
<i>to make it more comfortable for a girl.</i>

1293
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:31,668
<i>I'm still scared you won't like it up here,</i>

1294
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:43,781
<i>unless you're nuts about
the sound of a mountain stream,</i>

1295
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:47,983
<i>or love to watch the sun seem to turn
a mountain peak around very slow.</i>

1296
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:53,899
Hey, Henry.

1297
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:01,299
<i>One of our neighbours
just came by to say hello.</i>

1298
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:03,386
<i>A little fawn I call Henry.</i>

1299
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:06,781
<i>He seems to ask,
"Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"</i>

1300
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:08,309
<i>So hurry, girl!</i>

1301
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:13,179
<i>So you'll be sure to recognise me
at the airport,</i>

1302
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:15,619
<i>I'll be wearing a bright green tie.</i>

1303
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:19,025
<i>P.S. I was just thinking how lucky I am.</i>

1304
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:21,459
<i>I happened to pick up
an old torn magazine</i>

1305
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:24,946
<i>and there is your picture,
smacking me right between the eyes.</i>

1306
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:28,665
<i>And only a short time later,
that very wonderful-looking little girl</i>

1307
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:30,746
<i>is coming to share my life.</i>

1308
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:55,464
Remarkable.

1309
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:58,702
What's so remarkable?

1310
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:02,068
Is it faith or just habit
that compels a woman

1311
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:05,262
to put on fresh makeup
before boarding a life raft?

1312
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:07,666
Aren't you jumping the gun?

1313
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:11,227
You're being a fatalist
about this business then?

1314
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:16,070
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1315
01:43:16,105 --> 01:43:16,422
I'm not sure I even know
what a fatalist is.

1316
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:19,259
How can you sit there so calmly then,

1317
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:21,540
when a little while ago
you were terrified?

1318
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:26,382
I sat down here with you because
I thought I might be able to help you.

1319
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,342
But I'm not needed.

1320
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,147
If you came over to give me help,

1321
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:35,228
it was partly because
you needed help yourself,

1322
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:38,058
very badly.

1323
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:42,508
Don't worry about me.

1324
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:44,985
I've just stopped worrying
about losing something

1325
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:47,704
I never had a chance to get
in the first place.

1326
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:51,186
Would the thing be a man?
Or am I getting too personal?

1327
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:53,105
You are.

1328
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,102
I don't care anymore.

1329
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:58,624
I've been kidding myself long enough.

1330
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:02,500
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

1331
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:05,667
What are you hiding from?

1332
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,305
Myself.

1333
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:14,902
He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.

1334
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:19,182
He has a right to know
what kind of a person I am.

1335
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:22,301
I'm going to tell him

1336
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:25,740
that I'm a different kind of person
than he thinks I am.

1337
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,822
I'm not wonderful,

1338
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:35,219
not kind, I'm not clean.

1339
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:42,587
Telling you these things is easy,
because you're a stranger

1340
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,780
and I'll never see you again.

1341
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:48,468
Telling him is...

1342
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:53,260
It's going to be one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life,

1343
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,622
'cause in my heart,

1344
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,462
I'll always see him

1345
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:04,703
even when he turns his back
and walks away.

1346
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:14,023
Look at my face.

1347
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:17,547
Wouldn't you walk away?

1348
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:22,669
I'm so much older
than my years have made me.

1349
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:26,870
Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.

1350
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:29,460
You'll see how very old I am.

1351
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:33,579
I'm beat.

1352
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:37,745
I'll make a swell-looking bride.

1353
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:40,543
A beat bride.

1354
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:45,906
But I'm not afraid anymore.

1355
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:52,186
Now that I know what's going to happen,
I'm almost happy.

1356
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:59,262
So, I wasn't making up my face
a few minutes ago.

1357
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:03,905
I was looking in the mirror, at me.

1358
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:09,430
Does that answer your question,
mister?

1359
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:13,429
I was mistaken.

1360
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:18,185
You aren't a fatalist.
You're a very courageous young lady.

1361
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:24,025
Maybe some of it will brush off on me
if I keep sitting here.

1362
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:28,067
Maybe I can throw a few things
out of my own life.

1363
01:46:48,910 --> 01:46:51,822
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't use them things.

1364
01:46:58,910 --> 01:47:01,026
- Do you have to do that?
- Yeah.

1365
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:09,219
Could I have my property back now?

1366
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:12,467
- Why?
- It would mean a great deal to me.

1367
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:16,542
Take away this feeling
of being constantly watched.

1368
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:20,902
I'm all right, now. Quite calm.
You can trust me.

1369
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:32,979
Sit down.

1370
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:39,220
You got lots to think about,
and maybe not so much time for to do it.

1371
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:03,186
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

1372
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:06,700
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1373
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:09,627
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1374
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:12,059
hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come...

1375
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:18,823
Sparks, get on the horn.

1376
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:21,180
Advised interception completed at 56.

1377
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:29,747
Okay, Dan. I'll take over.

1378
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:47,741
Go back now. Take the Gibson girl,
get the passengers all set.

1379
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:49,781
You'll have plenty of time.

1380
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:54,188
Turn on the seat belt sign 10 minutes
before we start for the water.

1381
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:06,868
Good luck, you guys.

1382
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:12,549
- Anything new with the wind, Lennie?
- No.

1383
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:14,747
We're not very fat, then?

1384
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:19,546
- If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.
- Eleven minutes? Is that all you need?

1385
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:23,028
- Are you sure?
- I know exactly where we are now.

1386
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,585
Eleven minutes more of fuel
would see us through.

1387
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:29,942
What increase in wind velocity would
we need to arrange that little thing?

1388
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:31,981
Twenty knots in the next hour.

1389
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:34,226
- That's asking a lot.
- Yeah.

1390
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:37,100
It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.

1391
01:49:37,230 --> 01:49:39,790
But if the wind swung around
a little more in the tail

1392
01:49:39,910 --> 01:49:41,184
it could be.

1393
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:48,143
I guess they'll pick us up
before we get too damp.

1394
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:50,101
Susie will sure be worried.

1395
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:53,666
She'll lay down the law.
Probably insist I quit flying.

1396
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:56,744
Will you?

1397
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:01,019
No.

1398
01:50:08,510 --> 01:50:11,627
- Everything's here. I just hope it works.
- It will.

1399
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:16,179
Wouldn't you rather
not have to depend on it?

1400
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:19,029
- What do you mean?
- Suppose we didn't ditch.

1401
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:20,424
You've got to.

1402
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:24,824
Lennie says all we need
is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.

1403
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:28,429
Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.

1404
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:33,825
Would you think I was wrong
if I tried to talk him out of it?

1405
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:36,267
Maybe try a little luck?

1406
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,545
Luck?

1407
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,741
That's has-been thinking.

1408
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:43,378
Wanna run out of fuel,
right over San Francisco?

1409
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:46,183
Wipe out a few bridges
or apartment houses?

1410
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:50,303
Sullivan's been over this ocean
lots of times. He knows his business.

1411
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:53,265
I've seen men act like this before.

1412
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:57,108
Sometimes because of one thing
or another,

1413
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,738
fella stops thinking straight temporarily.

1414
01:51:07,190 --> 01:51:09,340
I've been flying a long time, Hobie.

1415
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:14,388
Only, you're not the captain.

1416
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:16,102
Maybe because your so-called luck

1417
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:18,949
ran out on you once
down in South America.

1418
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:21,141
This is no luck operation.

1419
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:27,148
You better go back to
your helmet and goggles.

1420
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,379
Maybe.

1421
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:33,380
Here it is, Lennie.
Colour may not become you

1422
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:37,546
- but it'll suffice you.
- Thanks, for nothing.

1423
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:44,665
About that 11 minutes,
are you absolutely sure?

1424
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:46,464
Absolutely.

1425
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:57,946
Lennie says if we can pick up
11 minutes, we can make it.

1426
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:05,748
He could be right.

1427
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:13,706
It'll be rough down there.
If we hit wrong, we've had it.

1428
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:20,906
Maybe we ought to ease off a little on
the power and save a few drops of fuel.

1429
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:25,066
Any objections if I try it?

1430
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,420
This won't work.
She's going to stall on me.

1431
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:34,586
That's no good.
We'll blow another engine.

1432
01:53:34,710 --> 01:53:37,702
What's the difference?
We'll blow them all if we ditch.

1433
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:40,823
Put those controls back
where they belong.

1434
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:43,950
- Put those props back.
- Nothing doing, Skipper.

1435
01:53:44,070 --> 01:53:45,549
That's an order!

1436
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:50,061
Hang on, chum. You can do it.
Now fly and let me pray.

1437
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,226
We'll run out of gas,
right over San Francisco.

1438
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:56,423
Let's try out this way for a while.
Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!

1439
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,225
- She's starting to shake again.
- Let her shake!

1440
01:53:59,350 --> 01:54:02,581
Let her mush down a few feet if you
have to. We're saving fuel this way.

1441
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:04,109
Hang on and fly!

1442
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,028
Did you call Sullivan's wife?

1443
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:15,300
Yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport.

1444
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:16,909
- You didn't alarm her?
- No.

1445
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:20,466
I just told her, her husband was on
his way, and that you wanted to see her.

1446
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:22,342
Then she knows something's happened.

1447
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:25,064
Probably. But her voice was quite calm.

1448
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:27,388
How about the others?

1449
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:31,139
Wheeler lives with another pilot,
Dupree. There was no answer.

1450
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:33,262
The same for Wilby.

1451
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:37,265
I called his home
and then a bar I know about.

1452
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:41,141
His wife had been there,
but she left about an hour ago,

1453
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:42,339
drunk.

1454
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:47,747
- The stewardess?
- No, Spalding's mother isn't well.

1455
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:50,384
Her father is out of town on business.

1456
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,261
I wish I could tell them all together.

1457
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:55,984
I think maybe they could
help each other.

1458
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:58,829
There isn't anybody listed on there
for Dan Roman.

1459
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:02,022
- Do you know any person close to him?
- Yeah.

1460
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:06,146
But I don't think you could reach her.
Dan lives alone.

1461
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:37,023
- Is everything all right?
- Just great, junior.

1462
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:41,701
This is a stunning garment.

1463
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:44,698
I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.

1464
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:48,789
It's a frowsy looking shroud,
if you ask me.

1465
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:54,499
Baby.

1466
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:01,704
I went through the first World War
and the Blitz in London.

1467
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:06,185
I was scared, but not like this.

1468
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:14,499
I want to show you something cute.
Want to see something cute?

1469
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:17,782
I must be slipping.

1470
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:22,062
No reaction, even from a man like you,
who should appreciate such things.

1471
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:29,025
Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.

1472
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:32,429
I'm frightened.

1473
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:35,587
Talking. Honey, you don't know
what you're asking.

1474
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:38,300
I'll tell you a good joke on me.

1475
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:41,581
You know, I always dreaded
the idea of becoming an old woman,

1476
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:45,908
and from the way things look now,
I won't have to worry about it anymore.

1477
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:49,946
You know, I haven't been whistled at
in years.

1478
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:51,788
And the idea of growing roses

1479
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:54,902
for the rest of my life
was really beginning to haunt me.

1480
01:56:57,110 --> 01:57:00,261
There ought to be a home
for dames like me.

1481
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,142
We should have organised.

1482
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:06,107
You know, a house somewhere
with no mirror in it.

1483
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:10,506
Far away, where we'd never have
to look at a young girl.

1484
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:13,778
They have homes
for unmarried mothers.

1485
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:17,028
But everybody forgets
about the girls who

1486
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:21,225
never quite managed
to make things legal.

1487
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:25,141
I think I could start one.

1488
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:30,946
I can call it the "May Holst Home
for Broken-down Broads. "

1489
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:35,420
I kind of like that, don't you?

1490
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:49,390
Well, they're as ready now
as they'll ever be.

1491
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:52,780
Can you take something else
in your stride?

1492
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:53,899
I can try.

1493
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:55,099
Good.

1494
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:57,107
I want you to do me a favour.

1495
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:02,866
Look, when I tell you, sit down there
with your back against that seat,

1496
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:05,060
stay there,
no matter what else is going on.

1497
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:07,943
Don't try to be a heroine
because in those last few moments,

1498
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:11,426
there isn't anything in the world
you can do to help anybody.

1499
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:13,859
You know, your face
can improve any landscape.

1500
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:15,582
I want you to keep it that way.

1501
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:17,268
So the favour for me is this pillow.

1502
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:20,507
Hold it tightly over your face,
for yourself and for me.

1503
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:22,939
With the wind and the sea
neither God nor Sullivan

1504
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:25,140
can set this thing down tonight
like an egg crate.

1505
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:29,149
We might just as well slam
into a mountain. Dan knows it. I know it.

1506
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:30,498
And so does Sullivan.

1507
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:39,349
Wilby, check your final position.
I'm going to take her down.

1508
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,983
- Wait a few more minutes.
- Do as I say.

1509
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,463
- But it looks like...
- Do as I say.

1510
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:43,818
Give him a few more minutes.

1511
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:46,180
I've already waited too long.
Here we go.

1512
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:50,144
No, we don't. Get a hold of yourself,
you yellow...

1513
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:59,787
420 is losing altitude, sir.

1514
01:58:59,910 --> 01:59:01,582
420, from Coast Guard.

1515
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:05,027
Radar reports you're descending.
Are you going to ditch?

1516
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:10,980
You are now below the minimum legal
altitude for approaching the coast.

1517
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:13,908
Time's wasting.
You better climb or settle for the drink.

1518
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:17,102
We're right with you. We'll follow you
down. Advise immediately.

1519
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:21,665
420 to Coast Guard.

1520
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:25,110
We've been too busy to answer.
Stand by.

1521
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:27,786
We may have a change in plans.

1522
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:40,829
<i>Thirty minutes of fuel left.
Cross-feed problem.</i>

1523
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:43,587
<i>Throw the rule book away.</i>

1524
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:46,788
<i>Highest obstruction, 1,950 feet,</i>

1525
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:49,219
<i>so 2,200 will be safe.</i>

1526
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:55,060
<i>Leonard, stand by electric altimeter,
call out readings.</i>

1527
01:59:55,190 --> 01:59:57,465
<i>Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.</i>

1528
01:59:57,590 --> 02:00:00,184
<i>More efficient use of fuel against time.</i>

1529
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,222
<i>Study approach book.</i>

1530
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:05,105
<i>Air Traffic Control to clear area.</i>

1531
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:07,625
<i>Direction finders on range station.</i>

1532
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:10,183
<i>Start right now.</i>

1533
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:13,939
Dan?

1534
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:15,779
Yeah?

1535
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,825
Thanks.

1536
02:00:18,790 --> 02:00:21,543
Thanks for knocking some sense
into my head.

1537
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:24,829
- Someday I'll explain.
- You don't have to.

1538
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:30,018
We're not going to ditch.
We'll make San Francisco the hard way.

1539
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:32,669
Any change in the wind, Lennie?

1540
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:34,428
We picked up three of those
11 minutes.

1541
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:37,383
Bring me the approach chart
for San Francisco.

1542
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:43,187
Whistle me a tune, Dan.

1543
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:46,261
I like music while I work.

1544
02:00:59,270 --> 02:01:02,785
- Can I get you something, Mr Briscoe?
- Yes. A ham sandwich.

1545
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:06,545
I can't. Everything went overboard.
Now you put on that vest.

1546
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:07,984
Great service.

1547
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:11,307
You throw all the food to the sharks,
so you won't have to serve it.

1548
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:13,746
Tell you what. Proposition.

1549
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:17,222
I think Miss Chen will let me
buy her a steak in San Francisco,

1550
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,386
if you come along, too.

1551
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:22,024
If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.

1552
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:25,064
Mr Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.

1553
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:35,305
- Take a breather, Dan.
- Okay.

1554
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:42,508
The Farallon Islands, any minute now.

1555
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:47,625
- Don't go any lower.
- No. I'll hold this altitude.

1556
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:50,389
Get back and call out our altitude
on the radio altimeter.

1557
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:53,388
We'll make straight for the
northwest leg of San Francisco range.

1558
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:56,104
The area's been cleared
and we're practically on the ground.

1559
02:01:56,230 --> 02:01:58,300
I like the way you said that.

1560
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:11,708
Twenty-eight miles to go.
He's made first base.

1561
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:14,549
But if that guy runs out of fuel
between here and the airport,

1562
02:02:14,670 --> 02:02:16,547
I don't know where he'll put
that thing down

1563
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,183
except in the middle of Market Street.

1564
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:32,428
Shut that thing off.

1565
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:38,859
Well?

1566
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:45,298
I'm going over to the terminal.
If needed, I'll be in the control tower.

1567
02:03:23,830 --> 02:03:25,582
This is it. Ten minutes.

1568
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:28,267
Come on, let's make a final check.

1569
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:35,299
Inflate your vest, please.

1570
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:37,386
- We're going down?
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

1571
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:40,343
Take your time coming back to the door.
Wait until I yell.

1572
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:43,826
- Coast Guard plane still with us?
- Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.

1573
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:45,508
Put out your cigarette, please.

1574
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:48,702
Inflate your vest, Mr Childs.
You too, Miss Holst.

1575
02:03:50,350 --> 02:03:53,626
- Some brassiere.
- Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.

1576
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:55,862
I really ought to take my briefcase.

1577
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:58,458
Sorry, nothing doing.
Inflate your vest, please.

1578
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,425
I can't.

1579
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:06,309
I'm terrified.

1580
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:08,942
I can't seem to move.

1581
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,947
Don't worry. Good luck.

1582
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:21,540
- All set, you two?
- We're still hungry.

1583
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:24,582
Our steak date is postponed.
Inflate your vest, please.

1584
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:31,183
Maybe you should keep this.

1585
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:34,347
I'd loved thinking it was mine,
even if it was just for a few hours.

1586
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:36,700
Nonsense.
You can keep it as dry as I can.

1587
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:38,946
If it's still working tomorrow night
at 7:00,

1588
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:42,142
take a cab to Ernie's restaurant
on Montgomery street.

1589
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:44,784
If it isn't working, come anyway.

1590
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:46,345
Thanks.

1591
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:49,225
We got them all to blow up, see?

1592
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:52,581
Good work. Remember take your time
coming back to the door.

1593
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:54,059
You want?

1594
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:56,346
No, thanks. Thanks just the same.

1595
02:04:56,470 --> 02:05:00,065
If anything happens to me,
get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.

1596
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:03,341
- Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken.
- You tell her yourself, mister.

1597
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:07,145
You'll be all right. I'm not worrying and
I'll be the last guy off this aeroplane.

1598
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:09,830
- Do you have to be?
- That's what I get paid for.

1599
02:05:11,390 --> 02:05:13,460
- Seat belt tight?
- I think so.

1600
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:16,263
This is for real, isn't it?

1601
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:18,984
I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.

1602
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:25,986
Well, even I might float.

1603
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:30,861
Inflate your vest, please.

1604
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:46,302
I don't want to die.

1605
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:49,661
Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.

1606
02:05:51,190 --> 02:05:54,546
Give her two of these when you can.
They'll quiet her.

1607
02:06:23,630 --> 02:06:26,747
Stand by for anything. Sullivan is gonna
try and make San Francisco.

1608
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:28,064
- Can we?
- I don't see how.

1609
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:30,829
Technically, we're out of fuel right now.

1610
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:35,223
We've bought it.

1611
02:06:48,350 --> 02:06:51,547
550 feet, Skipper.
The coast hills must be coming up.

1612
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:53,501
- Watch it!
-400, a little less.

1613
02:06:53,630 --> 02:06:54,779
Hang on!

1614
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:58,625
330.

1615
02:06:59,070 --> 02:07:00,059
250.

1616
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:01,664
Ground's coming up fast!

1617
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:07,428
200, Skipper. This ain't good.

1618
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:11,339
180.

1619
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:20,542
420, from Coast Guard.

1620
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:23,259
Twin Peaks coming up on your left
in a minute or so.

1621
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:25,824
Remember those radio towers.
Stay on course.

1622
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:27,942
Don't descend anymore.

1623
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:30,301
Thanks. We're trying not to.

1624
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:32,988
150 feet, Skipper!

1625
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:10,019
300 feet, Skipper.
We must be past the hills.

1626
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:17,939
400.

1627
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:23,228
500. We're living!

1628
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:36,149
420, this is San Francisco Towers.
Special weather.

1629
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:40,782
Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.
Wind, west northwest.

1630
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:43,186
Twenty to 25. Over.

1631
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:47,744
Okay, San Francisco Tower.
We'll make an ILS approach.

1632
02:09:48,230 --> 02:09:50,664
Turn the runway lights up full blast.

1633
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:45,784
- Cone of silence.
- Right with you, chum.

1634
02:10:45,910 --> 02:10:49,027
- We're cleared straight on down.
- This is going to be a fast one.

1635
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:51,380
Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.

1636
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:57,620
Get the outer marker, Dan.

1637
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:01,461
Outer marker identified.
But we're way below our glide path,

1638
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:02,739
so watch it, chum.

1639
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:05,464
There's a 690-foot radio tower
around here someplace.

1640
02:11:05,590 --> 02:11:08,423
Has to be behind us,
we're right on the approach leg.

1641
02:11:08,950 --> 02:11:11,225
Let me know it when they're clear.

1642
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:36,625
Feather it, Dan! Quick!
No time to fool with it.

1643
02:11:39,670 --> 02:11:42,059
Give me full power on the other two.

1644
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:46,541
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

1645
02:12:10,710 --> 02:12:12,223
- Contact yet?
- No.

1646
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:19,026
- This is a sweater.
- You're doing fine.

1647
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:23,142
When we pass the inner marker,
I'm shoving her down regardless.

1648
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:24,259
Yeah.

1649
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:31,385
Approach lights dead ahead.
Maybe a mile.

1650
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:33,023
Give her the gear.

1651
02:12:34,110 --> 02:12:35,668
Three green lights and pressure.

1652
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:43,822
We can only stay in the air
another 30 seconds.

1653
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:47,069
- Full flaps.
- Full flaps.

1654
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:01,464
Now I lay me down to sleep.

1655
02:13:58,070 --> 02:14:00,504
Did you get hurt?
Was anyone hurt at all?

1656
02:14:12,670 --> 02:14:13,944
Two more coming down now.

1657
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:15,469
There's Mr Pardee,
the famous producer.

1658
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:17,581
He'll give us some information.

1659
02:14:20,590 --> 02:14:23,388
- You're Gustave Pardee, aren't you?
- I was. I'm not so sure now.

1660
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:25,421
Please leave us alone. We're very tired.

1661
02:14:25,550 --> 02:14:27,142
Give us a few words about your flight.

1662
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:29,101
I couldn't tell you.
Not in a million words.

1663
02:14:29,230 --> 02:14:32,666
- What will your next production be?
- It will take a little longer than usual.

1664
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:34,348
- Next year, I hope.
- Next year?

1665
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:35,789
Now, please let us pass.

1666
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:47,299
Sally!

1667
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:51,264
Who are you?

1668
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:09,103
Miss, just one statement.

1669
02:15:09,790 --> 02:15:12,350
- Tell us who you are.
- What's your name?

1670
02:15:16,510 --> 02:15:18,262
- Why, it's a boy!
- Little boy.

1671
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:21,462
He'll sure have a story
to tell his grandkids.

1672
02:15:30,910 --> 02:15:34,619
- Daddy wants you to come and see him.
- I will, darling. I will!

1673
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:39,500
Look at my space material.

1674
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:47,498
- Here he is. Who's that?
- Give us a statement.

1675
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:52,668
Where's the nearest telephone?
I have to call Honolulu, my wife.

1676
02:15:52,790 --> 02:15:53,984
- Over there.
- Thanks.

1677
02:15:54,110 --> 02:15:55,509
No questions, please.

1678
02:15:55,630 --> 02:15:57,029
What happened?

1679
02:15:57,230 --> 02:15:59,346
Here she is.

1680
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:02,545
Hold it right there. Thank you.

1681
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:04,342
She must be in show business.

1682
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:06,381
She's in show business, all right.

1683
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:12,022
She's the star of the Follies!

1684
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:15,183
Tell us your story.

1685
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:17,789
Just one.

1686
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:30,710
Papa!

1687
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:35,702
Just a moment.

1688
02:16:37,710 --> 02:16:41,305
Listen, boys. I'm just a fisherman.
I want to see my kids.

1689
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:57,900
Thirty gallons, Mr Garfield.
That's all there was left in all the tanks.

1690
02:16:58,030 --> 02:17:00,066
Too little to really measure.

1691
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:06,704
Tell this man we must have
reservations on the plane,

1692
02:17:06,830 --> 02:17:07,945
first thing tomorrow morning.

1693
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:10,982
We'll miss Elvira's party.
It's important to you.

1694
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:13,260
What's Elvira's party
got to do with sled dogs?

1695
02:17:13,390 --> 02:17:15,301
Really, darling. Don't be tiresome.

1696
02:17:15,430 --> 02:17:19,218
We might as well play safe until you find
out how things are going to turn out.

1697
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:20,863
All right, Lydia.

1698
02:18:01,470 --> 02:18:02,744
Hello, Pete.

1699
02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:06,222
Meet us out front.
We're going for our steaks.

1700
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:12,221
Ten minutes, Mr Briscoe,
I'll be there for sure.

1701
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:00,468
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr Garfield.

1702
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:06,543
- I think your wife's waiting for you.
- Yeah.

1703
02:19:07,430 --> 02:19:10,979
I don't want to keep her
standing too long. We're expecting.

1704
02:19:11,390 --> 02:19:14,302
When you get rested, call me.
We'll have a talk.

1705
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:16,860
Yeah, sure.

1706
02:19:21,670 --> 02:19:22,944
Good night.

1707
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:25,344
Good night.

1708
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:30,587
Good night, Mr Garfield.

1709
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:38,345
- Souvenir?
- For my wife.

1710
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:41,943
I guess the rain won't hurt it,
better get it home though.

1711
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:44,345
Susie will be waiting. Good night.

1712
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:59,866
Well, I guess I better get going.
Little past my bedtime.

1713
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:02,061
You had 30 gallons left.

1714
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:05,065
Yeah.

1715
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:08,859
Good night. We'll get together soon.

1716
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:11,384
Sure, chum.

1717
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:24,864
So long.

1718
02:20:26,910 --> 02:20:29,708
So long, you ancient pelican.
