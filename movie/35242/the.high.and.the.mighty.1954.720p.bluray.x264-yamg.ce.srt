1
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,357
嘿,伙计。
Hey, fella.

2
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,160
你不是丹·罗曼吗?
Ain't you Dan Roman?

3
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,664
是的。
Yeah.

4
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:08,102
我听到你吹口哨，我对自己说，只有一个人会这么做。
I heard you whistlin' and I said to myself, only one guy does that just so.

5
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:11,505
我到哪都能认出你这张丑脸。
I'd know that ugly face of yours anywhere.

6
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:13,107
但你肯定不记得我了。
But you don't remember me, I bet you.

7
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,776
我当然知道。本德。
Sure I do. Ben Sneed.

8
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:21,982
我还以为你会在很远的地方独自挤牛奶呢……我是说，我以为你不再坐飞机了。
I thought you'd be milkin' cows somewheres on your own far... I mean, I, I thought you'd quit flying.

9
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:27,321
我…我以为你会远离这些东西。
I... I, I thought you'd stay away from these things.

10
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,922
它们只是一大块金属。
They're only a hunk of metal.

11
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,192
他们不去特定的地方。
They don't go no place in particular.

12
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,061
我想我只是意志力不够，本。
Well, I guess I just haven't got much willpower, Ben.

13
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,496
你在忙什么呢?
What are you up to?

14
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,398
远东公司的队长。
Crew chiefin' with Far East.

15
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,801
这是一份好工作。
It's a good job.

16
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,174
我得走了，丹。
Well, I gotta go, Dan.

17
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,710
我只是想打个招呼。
I just thought I'd say hello.

18
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,479
确定。祝你好运。
Sure. Good luck.

19
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,371
你们认识那个人吗?
Either one of you know that man?

20
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:18,905
作为副驾驶，这看起来太老了。
Sure looks old for a copilot.

21
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,407
不知道我们这么穷。
Didn't know we were so hard up.

22
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,976
他不是一直都是副驾驶。
Oh, he weren't always a copilot.

23
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,512
我们以前叫他"吹口哨的丹"
We used to call him "Whistling Dan."

24
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:28,115
你认识的最优秀的人之一。
One of the finest men you'd ever know.

25
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,883
也是最悲惨的。
And the most miserable.

26
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,619
他和我当时在哥伦比亚。
He was down in Colombia same time I was.

27
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:40,127
一天晚上，他满载着飞机起飞了其中一个南美的线路暴风决定同时袭击现场。
He's taking off one night with a full load and one of them South American line squalls decided to hit the field at the same time.

28
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:45,299
风转得太晚了，他停不下来，他还没翻过田野尽头的一座小山丘。
The wind shifts too late for him to stop and he don't quite make it over a little hill at the end of the field.

29
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,943
我记得那句话。就在战后，不是吗?
I remember that one. Right after the war, wasn't it?

30
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:53,340
是的。丹拍了一下，但飞船断成两半10秒后就开火了。
Yeah. Dan hits flap, but the ship breaks in half and there's nothing but fire in 10 seconds.

31
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:59,012
丹从驾驶舱窗户被扔了出去，只有几处擦伤和他的游戏腿。
Dan gets tossed through the cockpit window and only gets a few scratches plus that game leg of his.

32
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,248
所以他还能活着自责。
Which leaves him alive to blame himself.

33
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:03,450
其他人都被杀了。
Everybody else gets killed.

34
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:06,052
听起来他很幸运。
Sounds to me like he was pretty lucky.

35
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:08,322
但事实并非如此。
It don't work out quite that way.

36
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:09,890
我认识其中两名乘客。
I knew two of the passengers.

37
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:11,925
他们动身去海滨度假。
They were off to the coast for a holiday.

39
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:22,025
每个人都认为自己是了不起的人，包括丹·罗曼。
Everybody thought they were wonderful people, including Dan Roman.

40
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:28,599
玛丽是丹的妻子，小托尼是他唯一的孩子。
Mary was Dan's wife and little Tony was his only kid.

41
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,569
是的。
Yup.

42
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:37,241
丹是我所认识的唯一一个有勇气不自杀的人。
Dan is the only guy I ever knew who had guts enough not to commit suicide.

Say, Skipper, how old would you say Dan Roman is?

133
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,699
在我出生之前，他就已经在开飞机了。
He was flying planes before I was born.

134
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,568
你自己看看。
Look at it yourself.

135
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,538
他在开放驾驶舱的日子里负责航空邮件。
He flew the airmail in the open-cockpit days.

136
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,274
我想他是在第一次世界大战时学会飞行的。
I think he learned to fly in the First World War.

137
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:36,910
还有耐力飞行，赛车，老式的巡回演出。
And endurance flights, racing, old-time barnstorming.

138
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:39,780
在天梯公司工作10到15年。
10 or 15 years with TransWorld.

139
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:43,117
在第二次世界大战中，他驾驶轰炸机袭击了普洛埃斯蒂油田。
In the Second World War, he flew a bomber in the Ploiesti oilfield raid.

140
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:50,091
他在德国的b -17轰炸机上失败了，最后在冲绳加入了一个B-29小队。
He took his cracks at Germany in B-17s, finally wound up with a B-29 squad in Okinawa.

141
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,895
我跟你打赌，他的工作时间肯定不止两万小时。
Well, I'll just lay you a bet he's got better than 20,000 hours.

142
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,666
这确实很尴尬。
It sure is embarrassing.

143
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,868
尴尬什么?
What's embarrassing?

144
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:05,773
好吧，好吧，他有那么多时间。
Well, well, he's got so much time and all.

145
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,811
他们一定是疯了才会雇他这样的老火车头。
You know, they must've been out of their heads to hire an old fire-horse like him.

146
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,081
为什么不让他在牧场上吃草呢?
Why not let him graze in the pasture?

147
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,150
都准备好了,伦尼?
All ready, Lennie?

148
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:17,351
万事俱备，队长。
All set to sign, Skipper.

149
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,253
请注意。
Attention, please.

150
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:22,690
海伦·贝尔夫人，请到售票处报到。
Mrs. Helen Bell, please report to the ticket office.

151
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,859
海伦·贝尔夫人，请到售票处报到。
Mrs. Helen Bell, please report to the ticket office.

152
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,728
我也是。
Me, too.

153
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,598
21岁的灵魂上。其余的货物。
Twenty-one souls onboard. The rest, cargo.

154
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:32,433
总值73000英镑。
73,000 pounds gross.

155
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:39,607
我对奥维尔说过，对威尔伯说过，我还对你说过，这东西永远不会离开地面。
I said it to Orville, I said it to Wilbur, and I say it to you, the thing will never leave the ground.

156
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:46,514
你可以依靠斯伯丁小姐照顾好你的儿子，菲尔兹先生。
You may rely on Miss Spalding to take good care of your son, Mr. Fields.

157
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:49,450
他不是第一个独自渡海的年轻人。
He's not the first young man to cross the ocean alone.

158
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,519
这对他来说将是一次相当大的冒险。
It will be quite an adventure for him.

159
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,488
不幸的是，他是一个相当有经验的旅行者。
He's, unfortunately, quite an experienced traveler.

160
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,324
他的母亲将在旧金山和他见面。
His mother will meet him in San Francisco.

161
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:59,827
她深褐色头发，非常漂亮。
She's brunette, and quite beautiful.

162
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,198
请在4号门等候，菲尔兹先生，请让托比自己登机。
If you'll wait at Gate 4, Mr. Fields, you may put Tobey aboard yourself.

163
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,466
谢谢你！
Thank you.

164
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,606
来吧，托比，我们走。
Come on, Tobey, let's go.

165
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:22,783
从洛杉矶飞来的1-4号航班，11号登机口。
Flight 1-4 from Los Angeles arriving, Gate 11.

166
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,618
你在看什么?
What are you looking at?

167
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:28,122
请注意。飞行14。
Attention, please. Flight 14.

168
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:32,360
从洛杉矶飞来的1-4号航班，11号登机口。
Flight 1-4 from Los Angeles arriving, Gate 11.

169
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:34,728
你觉得我也会这样吗?
You suppose it'll ever happen to me?

170
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,065
很抱歉再次打扰你，我可以在哪里发电报呢?
I'm sorry to bother you again, but where can I send a cable?

171
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,501
就在纪念品摊的对面。
Just across from the souvenir stand.

172
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,479
你确定我们能搭上那架纽约的飞机吗?
You're sure about our connecting with that New York plane?

173
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:45,573
你会赶上的，莱斯先生。
You'll make it with time to spare, Mr. Rice.

174
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,775
我们会赶上的，还有时间。
We'll make it with time to spare.

175
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,612
那位小女士的祖父留给了她智慧和财富。
That little lady had a grandfather who left her both brains and riches.

176
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:56,417
不久前她为丈夫买了一家广告公司，因为他想要一个新玩具。
She bought her husband an advertising agency not long ago, because he wanted a new toy.

177
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,951
你是怎么知道这些事情的?
How do you know these things?

178
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,388
我曾在内华达州的一家酒店做夜班服务员。
I used to be a night clerk in a Nevada hotel.

179
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:03,591
飞往旧金山的7号航班正在登机。
Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.

180
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,764
Locota先生吗?
Mr. Locota?

181
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:13,567
是的。是的,这就是我。
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

182
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:14,902
我是一个渔民。
I'm a fisherman.

183
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:20,274
我的家族当渔民已经有几百年了，也许还更长，我不知道。
My family have been fishermen for a couple of hundred years, maybe more, I don't know.

184
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:26,214
这里的鱼不像加州海岸那样成群结队。
The fish, they don't school up here like on the coast of California.

185
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,749
所以我现在要回旧金山了。
So, I'm gonna go back to San Francisco now.

186
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,050
谢谢你，洛科塔先生。
Thank you, Mr. Locota.

187
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,286
您乘坐的飞机几分钟后广播。
Your plane will be announced in a few minutes.

188
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,655
你不需要我们帮你检查一下吗?
Don't you want us to check that through for you?

189
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,892
但我带了旅行吃的东西。
But I got in here my things for to eat for the trip.

190
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:41,929
你伤了我的心，洛科塔先生。
Well, you've hurt my feelings, Mr. Locota.

191
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:45,633
你以为你不会吃我的午餐，或者我们晚餐吃的牛排吗?
Did you think you wouldn't eat my lunch, or the steak we're gonna have for dinner?

192
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:49,136
女士，小姐，我不知道这些事。
Ma'am, miss, I don't know about these things.

193
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,704
我以前从来没有坐过飞机。
I never fly before.

194
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:53,641
我不想给任何人制造麻烦。
I don't want to make no trouble for nobody.

195
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,043
很乐意为您服务，洛科塔先生。
Serving you will be a pleasure, Mr. Locota.

196
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,778
谢谢你！
Thank you.

197
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,717
稍等，洛科塔先生。你就在那里。
Just a minute, Mr. Locota. There you are.

198
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,720
谢谢你！非常抱歉。
Thank you. Excuse me very much.

199
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,327
你根本不了解那个小个子男人。
You didn't know all about that little man.

200
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,230
除了统计数字外，他身上什么都没有。
The ticketing sheet had nothing on him except statistics.

201
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:18,466
恐怕他属于“无名小卒”那一类。
I'm afraid he falls into the "nobody" category.

202
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:21,168
对我来说，他不仅仅是一个数据。
He's gonna be more than a statistic to me.

203
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,803
我喜欢他。
I like him.

204
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,704
哦,哥哥。我会很高兴登上那架飞机吗?
Oh, brother. Will I be glad to get on that plane.

205
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,072
你不喜欢檀香山吗?
Didn't you enjoy Honolulu?

206
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:39,508
听着，亲爱的，我一直过得很开心。
Oh, listen, honey, I always enjoy myself.

207
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,478
但这个地方，有椰子的科尼岛。
But this place, Coney Island with coconuts.

208
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:47,349
据我所知，你可以把夏威夷所有的岛屿…呃,呃,呃…
As far as I'm concerned, you can take all the Hawaiian islands... Uh, uh, uh...

209
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:54,356
托比，你能帮我告诉你妈妈一件事吗?
Tobey, will you tell your mother something for me?

210
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:59,794
告诉你妈妈我们之间不应该有海洋。
Tell your mother that there shouldn't be an ocean between us.

211
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:02,464
告诉她，我希望她下次能和你一起去。
Tell her I, I wish she'd come with you next time.

212
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,269
你还记得吗，托比?
Can you remember all that, Tobey?

213
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:08,803
是的,爸爸。
Yes, Daddy.

214
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,452
我抓住他了，爸爸。我得到了他。
I got him, Daddy. I got him.

215
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,253
一切都好吧,丹?
Everything okay, Dan?

216
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:00,255
是的。一切都很好。
Yeah. Everything's fine.

217
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,424
3050上。
3,050 aboard.

218
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:04,659
4号，漏油了。
There's a slight oil leak, number four.

219
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,461
没什么好担心的。
Nothing to worry about.

220
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:07,896
它看起来有多长?
How long does it look like?

221
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:10,732
伦尼说大约12小时15分钟。
Lennie says 12 hours and 15 minutes, about.

222
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:13,168
整整12小时16分钟。
12 hours and 16 minutes exactly.

223
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:18,039
飞往旧金山的7号航班正在登机。
Flight 7 for San Francisco now loading.

224
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:22,377
旧金山。我必须去旧金山。
San Francisco. I must go to San Francisco.

225
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,145
对不起，先生，我们马上就要出发了。
Sorry, sir, we're departing very shortly.

226
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,447
你不在名单上。
You're not on the list.

227
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,716
肯尼斯·查尔兹先生在你的飞机上，对吗?
Mr. Kenneth Childs is on your plane, isn't he?

228
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,319
为什么,是的。蔡尔兹先生……那你一定有空间。
Why, yes. Mr. Childs... Then you must have room.

229
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:32,787
我坚持。我必须走了。
I insist. I must go.

230
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:36,925
很好，先生。幸运的是，如果你是美国公民，我们今天有空位。
Very well, sir. Fortunately we have space available today if you're an American citizen.

231
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,160
我是。哦，我肯定。
I am. Oh, I am for sure.

232
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,396
我叫汉弗莱·阿格纽。
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

233
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,131
我是阿格纽艾滋病的创始人。
I'm the founder of Agnew Aids.

234
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:45,534
就在檀香山。也许你听说过吗?
Right here in Honolulu. Perhaps you've heard?

235
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,203
哦,是的,是的。你有旅行卡吗，阿格纽先生?
Oh, yes, yes. Do you have a travel card, Mr. Agnew?

236
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,071
我买什么东西都付现金。
I pay cash for everything.

237
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:55,710
嗯，请您穿过大厅，到移民局检查一下，然后再来这里，我们会为您准备好机票，先生。
Well, if you'll just step across the lobby and check with immigration, then come right back here, we'll have your ticket ready, sir.

238
00:16:58,324 --> 00:16:59,825
现在，一个真正的庸医来了。
Now, there goes a real quack.

239
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:02,794
他靠卖阿格纽的艾滋病发了财，过上了更好的生活。
He's made a fortune selling Agnew's Aids to better living.

240
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:03,962
你们有什么?
What have you got?

241
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:07,466
哮喘，关节炎，疟疾，胆汁，肝黏?
Asthma, arthritis, ague, biliousness, sticky liver?

242
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,801
阿格纽有治疗他们所有人的药。
Agnew has got a curing pill for all of them.

243
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,903
再见,奥尔索普。玩得开心。
So long, Alsop. Have fun.

244
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,839
我会在你的婚礼上哭的，斯伯丁。
I'll weep at your wedding, Spalding.

245
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:35,194
我可以帮你拿外套吗，帕迪太太?
May I take your coat, Mrs. Pardee?

246
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:42,534
你没事吧，洛科塔先生?
You all right, Mr. Locota?

247
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,403
哦,是的,是的。
Oh, yes, yes.

248
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,638
我们要飞得很高吗?
We going to fly very high?

249
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:50,076
7000到9000英尺，长官，取决于我们的许可。
Oh, 7,000 or 9,000 feet, sir, depends on our clearance.

250
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,644
您愿意靠窗坐吗，布里斯克先生?
Wouldn't you like to sit next to the window, Mr. Briscoe?

251
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:53,745
你知道吗，小姐?
You know something, miss?

252
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,448
这就是这具老尸体的极限了。
This is as far as the old carcass would go.

253
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,850
不管怎么说，我宁愿看你，也不愿看外面。
I'd rather look at you than what's outside, anyhow.

254
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:01,353
你的安全带没系好。你真丢脸。
Your seat belt isn't fastened. Shame on you.

255
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:07,426
我的手臂就是不能弯曲。
My arm just won't bend around the way it should.

256
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,695
我骨头上有洞，至少他们是这么说的。
Holes in my bones, or so they tell me.

257
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,231
我没看到任何漏洞。
I don't see any holes.

258
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,666
你知道吗，小姐?我也不知道。
You know something, miss? Neither do I.

259
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,920
要不要我把你的帽子放在凉爽的地方?
Would you like me to take your leis and put them in a cool place?

260
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:27,113
他们会保持更好。
They'll keep better.

261
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:31,283
这大概是有史以来最聪明的主意了。
Now, that's just about the smartest idea anybody ever had.

262
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,552
我们得尽可能地留住他们。
Gotta keep them as long as we can.

263
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:36,488
明天得回老盐矿去了。
Gotta get back to the old salt mines tomorrow.

264
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:38,490
埋头苦干。
Get the nose to the grindstone.

265
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,460
这是夏威夷语的“谢谢”。
That's Hawaiian for "thank you."

266
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:52,538
我来告诉你。如果我们遇到任何麻烦，任何飞行员无法处理的大麻烦，你就来找老艾德·约瑟夫。
Let me tell you something. If we get into any trouble, any serious trouble that the pilot can't handle, you just come to old Ed Joseph.

267
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:55,741
如果他需要我，我很乐意上去帮他。
I'll be glad to go up there and help him if he needs me.

268
00:18:55,774 --> 00:18:57,409
明白了吗?明白了。
Got it? Got it.

269
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:59,010
你。
You.

270
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:09,288
好了，年轻人，现在是你全力以赴的时候了。
All right, young man, it's time to get you buckled down now.

271
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:12,158
让你在这里舒适舒适。
Just make you nice and comfy here.

272
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:18,096
接下来我们就会飞上天空了，好吗?
And the next thing you know we'll be in the air, all right?

273
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,369
你介意我在起飞时坐在你旁边吗?
You mind if I sit next to you during takeoff?

274
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,337
我会很高兴的。
I would be so pleased.

275
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:40,118
我很高兴你愿意坐在我旁边，因为我一直在看着你走下红毯，并且很想对你说些什么。
I am so happy you wish to sit next to me, because I have been watching you walk down the aisle, and have the desire to say a thing to you.

276
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:48,794
而是你是我第一个当面问候过的真正活着的美国女孩。
It is that you are the first real, alive American girl I have ever greeted in person.

277
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:52,198
你是如此的美丽。
You are so very beautiful.

278
00:19:53,199 --> 00:20:03,041
如果所有的美国女孩都是那么美丽和善良，我恐怕会觉得自己是一个非常丑的人。
I fear I shall feel terribly the ugly one, if all the girls in America are so beautiful and kind.

279
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,477
我觉得你什么都不用担心。
I don't think you're going to have to worry about a thing.

280
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,551
掉了。
Off.

281
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,519
翼襟翼。15度。
Wing flaps. 15 degrees.

282
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:15,488
混合物。汽车丰富。
Mixture. Auto rich.

283
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,023
V1和v2的速度?
V1 and v2 speeds?

284
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:20,526
112, 116，差不多了。
112, 116, that about does it.

285
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,828
检查无线电了吗，丹?是的。
Check the radios, Dan? Yeah.

286
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:25,331
准备好起飞了。
420 ready for takeoff.

287
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:27,600
好了，伦尼，把你的盘子送过去。
Okay, Lennie, let's deliver your tray.

288
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,477
当你有时间的时候，我希望你能回来和我的一位乘客谈谈。
When you have time, I wish you'd come back and talk to one of my passengers.

289
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,569
好吧。
All right.

290
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:14,240
他是帕迪先生，身材高大，满脸皱纹，坐在右半部分。
He's a Mr. Pardee, big rumpled-looking man, sitting halfway back on the right side.

291
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:16,485
艾尔索普说他和纽约剧院有关。
Alsop said he had something to do with the New York theater.

292
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,578
我猜他是想把你推上舞台。
I suppose he wants to put you on the stage.

293
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:20,513
如果你需要为你的法官辩护就打给我。
Call me if you need your honor defended.

294
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:23,249
跳出油锅又入火坑?
And jump from the frying pan into the fire?

295
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:25,385
他是原版的“受惊的弗雷迪”。
He's the original "frightened Freddie."

296
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:29,555
每次你倾斜或改变螺旋桨的螺距，它就会变白。
Every time you bank or change propeller pitch, he goes all white.

297
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,024
像抓电椅一样抓住他的座位。
Grabs on his seat like it was an electric chair.

298
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,459
好吧。
Okay.

299
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,641
我还以为你要戒烟呢。
I thought you were going to quit smokin'.

300
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:42,368
我做到了。我已经3小时20分钟没抽烟了。
I did. I haven't smoked in three hours and 20 minutes.

301
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,504
来吧，给你的牙齿染色。
Go ahead, stain your teeth.

302
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:52,512
等你长大了来看我吧，小子。
Come and see me when you grow up, junior.

303
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:08,788
你到底在吵什么?
What in the world are you bawling about?

304
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,790
是我做了什么事导致这一切的吗?
Have I done something to bring this on?

305
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:12,224
哦。
Oh.

306
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,027
内尔，别闹了。
Oh, Nell, cut it out.

307
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,363
我想。
I'm trying to.

308
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,565
我只是不能。
I just can't.

309
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:25,671
一切都结束了。
It's just, it's all over.

310
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,007
结束什么?
Well, what's over?

311
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,911
我们的蜜月。
Our honeymoon.

312
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:37,683
这对你一点意义都没有吗?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

313
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:39,652
当然了。
Of course it does.

314
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:42,922
但还有12个小时左右才会结束。
But it's not over for another 12 hours or so.

315
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:45,458
亲爱的，在我看来，这永远都不需要。
And, honey, it never has to be as far as I'm concerned.

316
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:48,294
哦,米洛。
Oh, Milo.

317
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,452
我很害怕。
I'm scared.

318
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,655
我只是害怕。
I'm just plain scared.

319
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:09,417
你怕什么?
What are you scared of?

320
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,252
整个世界都在我们面前。
We've got the whole world in front of us.

321
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,623
只是我们太年轻了。
Well, it's just that we're so young.

322
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:21,195
就像你说的，下面有一个大世界。
And just like you said, we've got that whole big world down there.

323
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:24,498
你知道吗?什么?
And you know what? What?

324
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,801
我们必须面对它。
We've got to face it.

325
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:30,070
我以为你对我有信心。
Well, I thought you had confidence in me.

326
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,311
哦，我当然知道。
Oh, of course I do.

327
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:46,487
只是世界上其他所有人都不如我了解你。
It's just that all the rest of the people in the world don't know you like I do.

328
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:54,962
假如我要生孩子了，而你没有工作怎么办?
Supposing I was going to have a baby and you didn't have a job?

329
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:56,206
你不应该……假设我是什么?
You're not supposed... Suppose I was?

330
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,998
好吧，好吧。
All right, all right.

331
00:25:58,031 --> 00:26:05,206
你要生孩子了，而我没有工作，家里没有吃的，外面还在下雪，治安官在敲门……哦,米洛。
You're going to have a baby and I haven't got a job, there's no food in the apartment, and it's snowing outside, and the sheriff's knocking on the door... Oh, Milo.

332
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,776
听着，我不是那个意思。
Look, I didn't mean it that way.

333
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,895
是吗?我什么?
Are you? Am I what?

334
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:30,531
嗯,你……嗯?
Well, are you... Hmm?

335
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:32,566
你知道的。
You know.

336
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,235
我吗?你。
Me? You.

337
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,188
哦。
Oh.

338
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,890
哦,米洛。不。
Oh, Milo. No.

339
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,561
你怎么会有这样的想法?
Whatever gave you such an idea?

340
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:47,597
我不知道。
I don't know.

341
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:12,632
费海提教授。受欢迎的。
Professor Flaherty. Welcome.

342
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,372
要我们相信你最终决定放弃艺术回归科学吗?
Are we to believe you are at last resolved to abandon the arts and return to science?

343
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:23,176
如果是这样，我们就欢呼。
If so, we rejoice.

344
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:26,446
我们非常想念你的帮助和建议。
We have sorely missed your help and advice.

345
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:29,349
你做得很好。
You're doing all right.

346
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:33,286
你会发现如何用自己的小聪明毁灭世界。
You'll find out how to blow up the world all by your little selves.

347
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:35,255
不会太久了，"啵! "
It won't be long now and "blooie."

348
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,757
祝贺你。
Congratulations.

349
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,728
教授，我们都很感激你一直承受着巨大的压力。
Professor, we all appreciate the fact that you've been under enormous strain.

350
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,832
我们深感遗憾，像你这样才干出众的人不再适合与我们合作。
We deeply regret that a man of your caliber no longer sees fit to cooperate with us.

351
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,835
合作吗?
Cooperate?

352
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:56,647
我在一个漂亮的小校园里有一个座位，即使我没有赚很多钱，或者我的学生不知道我在说什么。
I had a seat on a nice little campus, even if I wasn't making much money, or my students didn't know what I was talking about.

353
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,948
我高尔夫打得很好，晚上也睡得很好。
And I played pretty good golf, and I slept nights.

354
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:07,887
我很高兴，因为我认为这仍然是上帝的事，与宇宙胡闹。
I was happy because I figured it was still God's business to monkey around with the universe.

355
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:12,225
他可以修正一颗恒星，让它燃烧10亿年。
He can fix a star so it'll burn for a billion years.

356
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:16,329
继续，你会发现如何在一分钟内烧掉一个。
Keep going and you'll find out how to burn one up in a minute.

357
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:21,334
你们有人费心去看那边的泻湖吗?
Did any of you ever bother to look at the lagoon out there?

358
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:30,543
它是美丽的和蓝色的，周围的人是棕色的和善良的，他们确实知道如何笑和唱歌。
It's beautiful and blue, and the people around it are brown and kind, and they did know how to laugh and sing.

359
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,547
只是现在泻湖里的鱼都死了。
Only now all the fishes in the lagoon are dead.

360
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:37,383
人们永远都很害怕。
And the people are scared forever.

361
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,953
他们不再唱歌了。
They don't sing anymore.

362
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:46,526
你找到了炸掉离着陆点65英里的窗户的方法。
You found a way to blow out a window 65 miles away from the impact point.

363
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,363
不过，假设有一位母亲抱着孩子站在窗户前。
Only, suppose there's a mother standing in that window with a baby in her arms.

364
00:29:54,734 --> 00:30:00,840
教授，我建议你去你的帐篷休息一会儿。
Professor, I suggest you go to your tent and rest for a while.

365
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:05,077
我会尽快为您安排运输回美国。
I'll arrange transport back to the States for you at the earliest possible moment.

366
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:07,413
是的,这样做。
Yeah, do that.

367
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:18,191
我想在山中找个牧羊人，或在雾中找座山，趁还来得及画出他们的画。
I want to find a shepherd in the hills or a mountain in the mist, and paint their picture before it's too late.

368
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:38,411
请原谅我再问一个问题，上尉。
So, you'll please forgive me another question, Captain.

369
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,581
你是不是有时有点害怕?
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

370
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:48,053
我在这里坐了近200次飞机，感觉比开车更安全。
I've made almost 200 flights across here and I feel a lot safer than if I were driving my car.

371
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:52,858
我有一个可爱的妻子和两个孩子，另一个即将出生。
I've got a lovely wife and two kids, another on the way.

372
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,161
如果我觉得不安全我是不会这么做的。
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think it was safe.

373
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:56,529
你对冲,船长。
You hedged, Captain.

374
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:58,531
你没有回答我的问题。
You didn't answer my question.

375
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:03,636
好啦，老实告诉我，到底是什么吓着了你?
Come now, be a good honest fellow and tell me exactly what frightened you?

376
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:09,688
好吧，好吧，那是技术事故。
Well, well, they were technical incidents.

377
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:11,623
我想你不会明白的，帕迪先生。
I don't think you'd understand, Mr. Pardee.

378
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:13,692
我完全理解。
I understand perfectly.

379
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:17,896
出于某种原因，你害怕自己无法达到圣经中的寿命。
For some reason, you were afraid you wouldn't reach your biblical span of life.

380
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:21,032
这正是我现在困扰的问题。
Which is precisely what's bothering me at the moment.

381
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:24,136
我确信我不能从这里游到最近的海岸。
I'm convinced I couldn't swim from here to the nearest shore.

382
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:26,538
你不用游泳，帕蒂先生。
You won't have to swim, Mr. Pardee.

383
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:28,573
假设你的一个发动机停止工作了?
Suppose one of your motors ceases to function?

384
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,142
我们就回火奴鲁鲁。
We'd just go back to Honolulu.

385
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:32,644
这些船在三个引擎的驱动下飞行得很漂亮。
These ships fly beautifully on three engines.

386
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:36,815
如果事情发生在我们无法回返的地方，我们就继续去旧金山。
If it should happen beyond our point of no return, we'd simply continue on to San Francisco.

387
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:40,485
那么，假设你的两台发动机对进一步的工作不感兴趣了?
Well, suppose two of your motors became uninterested in further toil?

388
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,322
每个引擎都是完全独立的。
Each engine is entirely independent of the other.

389
00:31:43,355 --> 00:31:47,392
两个人在同一航班上辞职的几率是几百万分之一。
The chances of two quitting during the same flight are one in several million.

390
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:51,930
即使这样，我们仍然可以飞得更低、更慢，但我们一定能到达目的地。
Even if that should happen, we could still fly, lower and much slower, but we'd get there.

391
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:53,432
你让我很安心。
You are very reassuring.

392
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:56,501
为什么我读到这么多车祸?
Why is it I read about so many crashes?

393
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,773
报纸总是夸大空难的重要性。
The newspapers always exaggerate the importance of an air accident.

394
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:04,576
如果我是其中一员，这对我很重要。
It would be very important to me if I were in one.

395
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:07,246
你不会的，帕迪先生。
You won't be, Mr. Pardee.

396
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,448
只是放松。享受你的飞行。
Just relax. Enjoy your flight.

397
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:16,020
请船长。我想和你谈一下。
Please, Captain. I'd like to talk to you for just a minute.

398
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,890
只能等一分钟，然后我就得回去工作了。
Well, it can only be a minute, then I'll have to go back to work.

399
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,860
恐怕我要让你难堪了。
I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass you.

400
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:24,296
我以前在泛美航空公司的保留区工作。
I used to work in reservations for Pan American.

401
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:26,498
这很好。
That's fine.

402
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:28,733
我很高兴你决定和我们一起坐飞机。
I'm glad you decided to try a flight with us.

403
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,835
这架飞机没有两个出口吗?
Aren't there two exits to this plane?

404
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:33,238
你和其他船员离开的地方?
One up forward where you and the rest of the crew leave?

405
00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:34,673
是的。
Yes.

406
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:37,376
我可以这样离开飞机吗?
Could I leave the plane that way?

407
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:39,344
和你和船员一起?
With you and the crew?

408
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:41,280
拜托，这对我很重要。
Please, it's very important to me.

409
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,195
不是你想的那样。
It's not what you're thinking.

410
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:49,967
我会在旧金山见我，但不是警察或任何会给你带来麻烦的人。
I am going to be met in San Francisco, but not by the police or anybody else who could get you into trouble.

411
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,802
这是行不通的。
It just wouldn't work.

412
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:14,063
困惑,船长?
Confused, Captain?

413
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:16,198
为什么,没有。这是你的。
Why, no. That's you.

414
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,635
那是八年前的我。
It was me, eight years ago.

415
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,941
一个美国人看到了这张照片。
A fellow in the States saw that picture.

416
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,343
他给我写了。
He wrote me.

417
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,580
我很孤独，所以我回答了。
I was lonely, so I answered.

418
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:38,087
有很多信，漂亮的信。
There were a lot of letters, beautiful letters.

419
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:42,157
上个月，我同意嫁给他。
And then last month, I agreed to marry him.

420
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:48,630
我一直没时间告诉他这张照片是八年前拍的。
I never got around to telling him the picture was eight years old.

421
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:57,672
我不想用我的烦恼烦你，但那个梦让我清醒了很长时间。
I don't want to bore you with my troubles, but that dream kept me sane for a long time.

422
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:06,648
我知道我是…一片混乱。
I know I'm a... A mess.

423
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,886
我比他想象的要老得多。
I'm so much older than he thinks I am.

424
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:16,691
但如果我能见到他，
But if I could just see him,

425
00:34:21,496 --> 00:34:23,232
然后没见他就走了。
and then leave without meeting him.

426
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:28,070
队长,请理解。
Please understand, Captain.

427
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:37,312
你问的事不完全是我的事。
Well, what you're asking is not exactly in my line.

428
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:42,617
让我考虑一下。我会告诉你的。
Let me think it over. I'll let you know.

429
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,274
报纸吗?
Newspaper?

430
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:07,008
哦,不,谢谢。
Oh, no, thanks.

431
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:09,544
美国电话电报公司(AT&T)怎么样?
How's AT&T?

432
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:11,380
哦，上升了一个点。
Oh, uh, it's up a point.

433
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:17,052
希望你别介意，我忍不住看着你。
I hope you don't mind, I, I couldn't help watching you.

434
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:21,490
你让我想起了我曾经认识的一个人。
You remind me so much of a man I, I once knew.

435
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:24,359
我叫肯·查尔兹，我一点也不介意。
My name is Ken Childs and I don't mind at all.

436
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:56,658
最后一次定位落后十四分钟，船长。
Fourteen minutes behind on the last fix, Skipper.

437
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:58,260
所以呢?
So?

438
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:01,038
不过我们应该和好。现在风向似乎改变了。
We should make it up, though. The wind seems to be shifting around now.

439
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:03,232
好。
Good.

440
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:06,468
有丹·罗曼这样的人在这里真好。
You know it's nice having a guy like Dan Roman up here.

441
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:09,704
换句话说，我不觉得自己像个爷爷。
For a change, I don't feel like a grandfather.

442
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:13,842
我那天还跟我老婆说，我从来没有过这么好的日子。
I was just saying to my wife the other day, I never had it so good.

443
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:20,081
工作很轻松，不紧张，我很幸运能有个像苏茜这样的女孩。
Easy job, no strain, and I'm pretty lucky in having a girl like Susie.

444
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:23,552
一个男人有什么样的妻子，这对整个世界都很重要。
It makes all the difference in the world what kind of a wife a guy has.

445
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:24,986
你不这么认为吗，船长?
Don't you think so, Skipper?

446
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,992
现在，你带一个像我的苏西一样的女孩。
Now, you take a girl like my Susie.

447
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:39,568
我想很多人都觉得这很有趣因为我也洗碗做饭，但他们忘了苏茜比我年轻多了。
Oh, I guess a lot of people do think it's funny because I do the dishes and the cooking, too, but they forget how much younger Susie is than I am.

448
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:47,409
至于偶尔多喝一杯马提尼……请原谅我再问一个问题，上尉。
And as for an extra martini once in a while... So, you'll please forgive me another question, Captain.

449
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:50,279
你是不是有时有点害怕?
Aren't you sometimes a little afraid?

450
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:51,780
．..它的精神。
...it's spirit.

451
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:56,084
你知道吗，她有一次打电话给我…是吗?
You know, she once called me... Are you?

452
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:05,327
你现在，没有任何理由…你等着看她怎么用我给她买的硬木托盘吧。
Are you now, for no reason at all... You wait till you see what she does with that hardwood tray I bought her.

453
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,352
在行驶了近200万英里之后……也许在她买的小酒吧旁边…害怕吗?
After almost two million miles... Maybe beside the little bar she bought... Afraid?

454
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:12,962
．..在我外出旅行时陪伴自己
...to keep herself company while I'm away on trips.

455
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:16,890
我不在的时候，她会把它拿给所有来陪她的人看。
She'll show it to all the fellas and girls who drop in to keep her company when I'm away.

456
00:37:18,992 --> 00:37:21,495
但它的存在。
But it's there.

457
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:23,897
就像肚子里有个包袱。
It's like a heavy bundle in your belly.

458
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:27,934
你几乎可以摸到它。
You can almost touch it.

459
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:32,539
她大部分时间都坐着它四处游荡，这样她就不会太孤单了。
She spent most of her time riding around in it so she wouldn't get too lonesome.

460
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:42,049
我猜她开得有点太快了…它的到来和其他许多人一样，没有任何原因，也许除了那两百万英里的磨损。
Guess she drove a little too fast... It's come like it has to so many others for no reason at all, except maybe the wear and tear of those two million miles.

461
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:46,087
．..因为它们看起来比实际速度快。
...because they look like they're going faster than they really are.

462
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:57,231
就像去年12月那个酒保跟我说的，她因为喝醉了酒在…他们会给你一张200万英里的证书，挂在家里的墙上。
And like what that bartender told me last December, when she was picked up for being drunk in and about... They'll give you a certificate for those two million miles, to hang on a wall at home.

463
00:37:57,264 --> 00:38:01,168
只是，这个证书不能算上损耗。
Only, the certificate doesn't add up the wear and tear.

464
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:04,037
．..但用词不当。这是她的精神。
...but the wrong word. It's spirit she's got.

465
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,241
丹知道了。
Dan knows about it.

466
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:13,814
老人们都说这只是暂时的，就像成长的烦恼一样。
All the old-timers say it's only temporary, like growing pains.

467
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:20,587
嗯，就像我上次旅行时她给我留的这张纸条……而现在，它却无缘无故地出现在这里。
Well, like this note she left me on my last trip... And now, it's here for no reason at all.

468
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,323
还记得我们有多累吗?
Remember how tired we were?

469
00:38:22,356 --> 00:38:23,724
你必须与之抗争。
And you've got to fight it.

470
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:26,760
听我说…所有的孤独。
Get a load of this... All alone.

471
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:29,263
“欢迎回家,胖子。
"Welcome home, fatso.

472
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:32,233
“我困了，等不及了，所以你搭了辆出租车。”
"Got sleepy and couldn't wait so you take a taxi.

473
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:38,839
"你回家的时候不要弄出任何声响在厨房里敲敲打打"早上也不要吵醒我。爱,苏茜。”
"Don't make any racket when you come home banging around the kitchen "and don't wake me up in the morning. Love, Susie."

474
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:43,510
多么有幽默感啊。
What a sense of humor.

475
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:51,252
你知道吗，有一天，他们会为导航员发明一种凳子，它将会接近人体的身体结构。
You know, someday, they're going to invent a stool for navigators that'll come somewhere near fitting the human frame.

476
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:56,490
问问霍比，他能不能更好地同步道具。
Ask Hobie if he can't synchronize the props a little better.

477
00:38:56,523 --> 00:39:00,127
我不知道是第一个还是第三个，但总有一个漏出来。
I don't know whether it's number one or number three, but one of them keeps slipping out.

478
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:01,795
真让我心烦。
It's getting on my nerves.

479
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:02,896
好吧。
Okay.

480
00:39:04,231 --> 00:39:05,975
船长说"你们是怎么了?
Skipper says, "What's the matter with you guys?

481
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:07,144
“你不能把道具放在一起吗?”
"Can't you keep the props together?"

482
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:09,002
他们在一起。
They are together.

483
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:11,138
斯基普说他们不合拍。
Well, Skipper says they're out of phase.

484
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:13,274
一个和两个像丝绸一样光滑。
One and two are as smooth as silk.

485
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,908
3和4也一样。
So are three and four.

486
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:16,410
所以要它。
So be it.

487
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:21,448
孩子们说道具再顺利不过了。
The boys say the props couldn't be smoother.

488
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,084
是吗?
Yeah?

489
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:27,621
嗯，有什么东西失控了。
Well, there's something haywire.

490
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:43,770
你还好吗，布里斯克先生?
Are you all right, Mr. Briscoe?

491
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:45,339
好吧?
All right?

492
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:48,108
小姑娘，我有一千万美元呢。
Little girl, I'm getting along like $10 million.

493
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:53,013
我能为你拿点什么吗?也许喝杯茶对你会有好处。
Can I get you something? Perhaps a cup of tea would taste good to you.

494
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,519
那是什么?
What was that?

495
00:39:58,552 --> 00:40:00,053
这是五点。
It's 5:00.

496
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:02,122
你是说它会报时?
You mean it chimes?

497
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:03,990
你听说过它。
You heard it.

498
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:09,830
有趣的事情。这恰好是我最后一笔没有转让给别人的财产。
Funny thing. It happens to be the last possession I haven't signed over to someone else.

499
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:12,032
我真希望它能再响一次。
Oh, I wish it would chime again.

500
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,136
多棒的计时方法啊。
What a wonderful way to keep track of the time.

501
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:20,741
如果我有一块这样的表，我就不能等下一个小时，再等下一个小时。
If I had a watch like this, I couldn't wait for the next hour to come, and then the next one.

502
00:40:20,774 --> 00:40:23,644
你知道吗?我以前也有同样的感觉。
You know something? I used to feel the same way.

503
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:27,248
但现在我并不急于打发时间。
But right now I'm in no hurry for the hours to pass.

504
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,419
不，手表是你的。我想把它给你。
No, the watch is yours. I want you to have it.

505
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:33,954
我不能接受它。
I couldn't think of accepting it.

506
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:35,055
请。
Please.

507
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:38,124
手表是我最不需要的东西。
A watch is the last thing I'm going to need.

508
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:44,731
我觉得这是只有年轻女孩才能享受的时光，令人兴奋的时光。
I'd like to think of it marking the kind of hours only a young girl can have, exciting hours.

509
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:47,601
如果你接受，我会很高兴的。
You'll make me very happy if you'll accept it.

510
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:49,603
好吧，如果你这么说的话。
Well, if you put it that way.

511
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,167
真不知道该怎么谢你。
I can't thank you.

512
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:57,605
我从来没有遇到过像你这样的人，但我这辈子都会记得你。
I've never met anyone like you, yet I shall remember you for the rest of my life.

513
00:40:57,638 --> 00:41:02,610
我希望你能记住这只是一件财产，所以并不值钱。
I'd rather you remember it's only a possession, and so, not worth very much.

514
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:05,246
我会的,永远。
I will, always.

515
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:09,617
我们又能听到它的声音了，它需要设置。
We can hear it chime together again, it needs setting, you know.

516
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:13,020
现在旧金山是7点。
It's 7:00 in San Francisco.

517
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,256
确定。我忘记了。
Sure. I forgot.

518
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,367
真的是7点了吗，小姑娘?
Is it really 7:00, little girl?

519
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,203
就这架飞机而言。
As far as this airplane is concerned.

520
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,706
你知道吗?我不想喝茶或咖啡。
Then you know something? I don't want tea or coffee.

521
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,007
一杯水?
A glass of water?

522
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,913
水是洗澡用的，但如果你能放点苏格兰威士忌进去，我会感觉更干净。是的,先生。
Water is for bathing, but if you can put some scotch in it, I'll feel cleaner. Yes, sir.

523
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:41,082
我喝鸡尾酒的时间早过了。现在。
It's way past my cocktail time. Right now.

524
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:42,383
那边那位朋友怎么样?
How about my friend over there?

525
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,419
和我一起喝一杯吧，先生?
Will you join me for a drink, mister?

526
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:47,222
是的，是的，非常感谢。
Yes, yes, uh, thank you very much.

527
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:53,361
那是非常好的音乐。
That's awful nice music.

528
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,398
我们只花了四分钟，船长。
We picked up four minutes, Skipper.

529
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:06,033
看来现在风向终于转过来了。
Looks like that wind is finally swinging around now.

530
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:08,135
好。
Good.

531
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,572
我可能会穿越奇迹，准时到达旧金山。
I may pass a miracle and hit San Francisco right on time.

532
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,475
有救生员吗，船长?
Have a Life Saver, Skipper?

533
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,911
不,谢谢。
No, thanks.

534
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:19,880
让我知道，你会吗，当我们过了不归路?
Let me know, will you, when we pass the point of no return?

535
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,486
自然。
Naturally.

536
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:54,903
莉迪亚，如果你不生气了，也许我们可以用合理的方式谈谈。
Lydia, if you're through pouting, maybe we could try talking things over in a reasonable manner.

537
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:57,239
我们没什么好谈的。
We have nothing to talk over.

538
00:43:57,273 --> 00:44:03,445
任何愿意把纽约的广告公司卖给加拿大一个破旧矿井的人……这不是坏了。
Anyone who would sell a New York advertising agency for a broken-down mine in Canada... It isn't broken.

539
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:08,117
只是为了让你觉得自己很重要，是大老板。用我的钱做手术。
Just to make yourself feel important, the big operator. Operating on my money.

540
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,588
我只是想早上起来的时候有一种感觉，那就是我今天完成的任何事情都是我自己努力的结果。
I just want to get up in the morning with the feeling that anything I accomplish that day is due to my own efforts.

541
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:16,024
不是因为我妻子正好继承了生意。
Not because my wife happened to inherit a business.

542
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:18,927
三年之内我就能还你钱了。每一分钱。
In three years I should be able to pay you back. Every penny.

543
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,935
在荒郊野外三年，我会是一个真正的乡巴佬，我的裙子应该在我的膝盖上，而我的裙子应该在我的脚踝上，或者相反。
Three years in the wilderness and I'd be a genuine country bumpkin with my skirts around my ankles when they ought to be around my knees, or the other way around.

544
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:33,509
最后一次，莉迪亚，我请你和我一起去。
For the last time, Lydia, I'm asking you to come with me.

545
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:39,215
我很高兴这是你最后一次提出这种疯狂的请求，这样我就不用再拒绝你了。
I'm glad it's the last time you're going to make that insane request, so I won't have to say no again.

546
00:44:39,248 --> 00:44:42,084
我要尽快离婚了。
I'm getting a divorce as fast as I can.

547
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:43,385
你疯了。
You're out of your head.

548
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:47,489
你穿着你的靴子和伐木工人的衬衫，我该怎么办?
What am I supposed to do while you clump around in your boots and lumberjack shirt?

549
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:49,958
和花栗鼠喝鸡尾酒?嗯?
Have cocktails with the chipmunks? Hmm?

550
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,494
和爱斯基摩人打桥牌?
Play bridge with the Eskimos?

551
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:54,796
继续去你的原始森林吧。
Go on off to your primeval forest.

552
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:59,235
扮演丹尼尔·布恩，和鸽子或者其他什么鸟在一起。
Play Daniel Boone, get up with the pigeons or whatever kind of birds they have up there.

553
00:44:59,268 --> 00:45:00,669
让你的手上长茧。
Get calluses on your hands.

554
00:45:00,702 --> 00:45:03,472
做个肮脏的小男孩。
Be a great dirt-under- the-fingernails boy.

555
00:45:03,505 --> 00:45:07,008
通过摩擦生火。吃罐头。
Make fire by friction. Eat out of cans.

556
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:10,078
星期六晚上洗个澡，然后去参加爱斯基摩人的土风舞会。
Take a bath Saturday nights and go to an Eskimo hoedown.

557
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:11,980
教他们跳桑巴舞，我才不在乎。
Teach them to samba, for all I care.

558
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:15,851
想怎么做就怎么做，如果能让你觉得自己是个男人的话。
Do just as you please if it will make you feel like a man.

559
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:19,155
但别让我跟你分享你的少年冒险。
Only don't ask me to share your juvenile adventures.

560
00:45:19,188 --> 00:45:21,022
为他们付钱已经够糟糕的了。
It's bad enough having to pay for them.

561
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,493
这是你最后的话吗?
Is that your last word?

562
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:25,961
不。
No.

563
00:45:25,994 --> 00:45:30,466
我一直觉得小咖啡杯能装下你的大脑。
I've always felt your brain would fit nicely in a demitasse.

564
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,237
嘿,伙计。
Hey, fella.

565
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:36,631
你除了麻烦什么都没有，对吧?
You got nothing but trouble, right?

566
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:42,644
我向你保证…我知道你要说什么，你的一切都很好。
I assure you... I know what you're going to say, everything with you is hunky-dory.

567
00:45:42,678 --> 00:45:45,247
有麻烦的人总是这么说。
That's the first thing a fella in trouble always says.

568
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:55,757
蠢人窝里都是那些保守秘密的人，要么是因为他们害怕说出真相，觉得自己会出洋相，要么是因为他们也这么想
The booby hatches are full of people that keep things to themselves, either because they're scared of tellin' the truth, thinkin' that they'll make a monkey out of themselves or they figure that

569
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:59,628
没有人能理解他们的处境。好吧?
no one else can appreciate the situation they're in. Okay?

570
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:02,464
好邻居们可不这么认为。
Well, the Good Neighbors believe that ain't so.

571
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:05,934
和谁…那是我家乡的俱乐部。
And just who... A club I belong to back home.

572
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:09,638
就像戒酒互助会
It's like the Alcoholics Anonymous.

573
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:12,600
他们的午餐很丰盛。
Their luncheons are a riot.

574
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:18,273
在扩音器的桌子上，他们有一条很大的毛巾上面写着"天哪"
Over the speaker's desk, they've got a great big towel with the letters "For crying out loud"

575
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:20,141
绣花。
embroidered on it.

576
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:23,578
每个成员都有自己的哭泣毛巾，明白吗?
And every member has his own crying towel, get it?

577
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:34,389
现在，当他们送来一个糟糕的病例时，几个好邻居会帮他拿毛巾这样他就可以集中精力哭泣，这样就不用用其他任何方式来折腾自己了。
Now, when they bring in a bad case, a couple of the Good Neighbors hold the towel for the fella so he can concentrate on weeping, and then don't have to exert himself in any other way.

578
00:46:34,422 --> 00:46:45,566
结果发现这是一个很好的老式的复兴会那个人当时没有什么特别的担心，他感觉自己被排除在外了。
Well, it turns out to be a good old-fashioned revival meeting and the fella who has no particular worries at the time, he sort of feels left out of things.

579
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:53,274
如果这家伙最后没有嘲笑自己，至少他会感觉好点。
And if this fella don't actually wind up laughing at himself, at least he feels better.

580
00:46:53,308 --> 00:47:01,416
最重要的是，每个人都这么认为，因为十有八九，他们认为自己比别人过得好。
And the main thing is, everybody does, because nine times out of 10, they think they're better off than the other fella.

581
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:05,019
你在会议结束时唱什么?
What do you sing at the end of your meetings?

582
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:06,987
把你的烦恼放进你的旧工具包里?
Pack Up Your Troubles In Your Old Kit Bag?

583
00:47:07,722 --> 00:47:09,357
你怎么猜到的?
How'd you guess?

584
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:22,170
现在，如果有个家伙遇到了大麻烦，比如他交不了所得税，或者他老婆把车撞坏了，或者他的新房子地基上出现了裂缝。
Now, when a fella comes in with real trouble, like he can't pay his income taxes, or his wife just smashed up the car, or, uh, his new house shows cracks along the foundation.

585
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:27,875
他们有一架能演奏真正悲伤音乐的风琴。
They've got an organ that plays real sad music.

586
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:30,478
这是一个点球。
It's a kick.

587
00:47:30,511 --> 00:47:32,413
是啊，我知道是怎么回事。
Yeah, I can see how it might be.

588
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:38,219
当然，一个人从来没有真正的麻烦。
Of course, a fella never comes in with real troubles.

589
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:44,759
比如他的妻子死了，或者他的生意真的破产了。
You know, like the guy's wife dying, or his business really going broke.

590
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:55,136
他们只是承认一些小问题，比如他们该由谁来修剪草坪，或者他们在高尔夫球场上能打到100分吗?
They just confess little problems, like who are they gonna get to mow the lawn, or will they ever break 100 on the golf course?

591
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,438
这都是相对的，明白吗?
It's all relative, see?

592
00:47:57,472 --> 00:48:08,082
当小问题出现时，你会习惯性地一笑置之，当真正严肃的事情发生时，你也不会大发雷霆。
You get the habit of laughing at little problems when they come along, and then you don't blow your top when the genuine, serious things happen.

593
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:10,105
明白了吗?
Get it?

594
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:15,977
是的，我开始明白你的意思了，呃…约瑟夫。我卖家具。
Yes, I'm beginning to follow you, uh, Mr... Ed Joseph. I sell furniture.

595
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:23,585
说回你的案子，如果我能哭几次也许会让你感觉好点。
Um, getting back to your case, maybe it'd make you feel better if, uh, if I cried some.

596
00:48:23,618 --> 00:48:27,022
那你就会明白好邻居是什么意思了。
Then you'd understand what the Good Neighbor means.

597
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:32,027
想象你自己拿着毛巾。
Uh, imagine yourself with a towel.

598
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,601
准备好了吗?
Ready?

599
00:48:40,735 --> 00:48:45,474
为了去夏威夷旅行，我和妻子省吃俭用了四年多。
The wife and I scrimped for over four years to take a trip to Hawaii.

600
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:53,082
棕榈树，阳光，沙子，我们家里没有的东西。
You know, palm trees, sunshine, sand, things we ain't got at home.

601
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:57,919
我们梦想着离开的那一天。
We dreamed of the day that we were to leave.

602
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:07,829
所以，妻子说服一个女人照顾我们的孩子，每天10美元，这比我结婚前5年赚的还多。
So, the wife persuades a woman to take care of our children for $10 a day, which is more than I made the first five years we were married.

603
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:20,109
我们把行李都拆了，过得很愉快，但船却开不了。罢工什么的。
We got all unpacked and were really living, but the ship don't sail. Strike or something.

604
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:21,610
但好吧，我们很幸运。
But all right, we're lucky.

605
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:29,418
我们买到了飞机上最后两张票，虽然我们不能带着所有的行李，但我们在我们的梦想之地。
We get the last two tickets on an airplane, and although we can't take all our luggage, we're in the land of our dreams.

606
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:34,156
在那家符合我们预算的小旅馆里，订房间的人弄错了。
At the little hotel that fits our budget, there's a mix-up in the reservations.

607
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:37,492
另一对来自密尔沃基的约瑟夫夫妇。
Another couple named Joseph from Milwaukee.

608
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:41,096
所以我们推测他们可能也做了个梦。
So we figure maybe they've had a dream, too.

609
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,532
所以我们不会引发任何争论。
So we don't start any arguments.

610
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,538
我们最后住进了一家远远超出我们预算的旅馆。
We finally wind up at a hotel which is way beyond our budget.

611
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:52,107
所以我们不得不缩短行程。
So we have to cut our trip short.

612
00:49:56,145 --> 00:50:04,353
好吧?到了晚上，妻子穿上了她可以带来的一件晚礼服，而我穿上了一件十年都没穿过的燕尾服。
Okay? Comes evening, the wife gets into the one evening dress she could bring along, and I get into a tux I haven't had on in ten years.

613
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:13,828
妈妈!
Mommy!

614
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:23,305
我们已经准备好迎接美妙的灯光了。
We were ready for the light fantastic.

615
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:28,243
妻子穿着新鞋，鞋跟比她习惯穿的高得多，而且……
The wife was wearing new shoes with heels much higher than she was used to and...

616
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:33,982
哦,我回来了!
Oh, my back!

617
00:50:37,586 --> 00:50:44,025
住院医生说妻子的骶髂关节扭伤了，所以不能再跳舞了。
The house doctor says the wife has twisted her sacroiliac which ends the dancing for the trip.

618
00:50:53,302 --> 00:50:55,404
所以,一切过去了。
So, everything passes.

619
00:50:55,437 --> 00:51:00,175
过几天，妻子就好了，可以一瘸一拐地到海边去了。
In a couple of days, the wife is well enough to hobble down to the beach.

620
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,923
一连下了三天牛蛙雨!
It rains bullfrogs for three straight days!

621
00:51:14,956 --> 00:51:20,629
我们要做的就是坐在一起，给家里写明信片，说我们过得多么愉快。
All we got to do is sit around and write postcards back home about what a wonderful time we're having.

622
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:31,340
我们只剩下三天了，然后去见威尔逊一家。
Three days we got left, then we meet the Wilsons.

623
00:51:31,373 --> 00:51:34,276
任何旅行的乐趣之一应该是你遇到的人，对吗?
One of the pleasures of any trip should be the people you meet, right?

624
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:37,379
威尔逊夫妇对什么是乐趣有自己的看法。
Well, the Wilsons had their own ideas of what was fun.

625
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:41,683
他认为我妻子是他的菜，而她认为我是克拉克·盖博。
He thought my wife was his dish, and she thought I was Clark Gable.

626
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:10,545
妻子不能跑得很快，因为她有骶髂关节。
The wife can't run very fast on account of her sacroiliac.

627
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,781
我要开自己的田径运动会。
I'm having my own track meet.

628
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:21,774
伙计，你要是没被那家伙的老婆绕着棕榈树追过，你就没活过。
Fella, you have never lived until you've been chased around the palm tree by that guy's wife.

629
00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:32,050
所以，我们剩下的梦幻之旅都是在远离酒店的地方吃饭，这样我们就不会碰到这些人，还得一直玩邮局的游戏。
So, we spend the rest of our dream trip eating away from the hotel so we don't run into these people and have to play post office all the time.

630
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:34,787
但最后一天太阳出来了。
But the last day the sun comes out.

631
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,491
有谁听说过梦想之旅回家后没有晒黑的?
Whoever heard of coming home from a dream trip without a tan?

632
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:40,025
我们绝望了,看到了吗?
We're desperate, see?

633
00:52:40,058 --> 00:52:43,729
我们一整天都在晒太阳。
We really soaked up that sun, all day.

634
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:53,539
妻子的肩膀上有三度烧伤。
The wife has a third-degree burn on her shoulders.

635
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:57,243
我不敢把任何重量放在我的背上。
I don't dare put any weight on my back.

636
00:52:57,276 --> 00:53:03,949
如果我们能回家的话，我得去银行借钱付下个月的伙食费。
I'm gonna have to borrow money from the bank to pay next month's food bill, if we ever do get home.

637
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:08,354
如果你还觉得自己有麻烦的话，先生…
If you still think you got troubles, mister...

638
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:14,493
不知道你和约瑟夫夫人是否愿意和我一起喝一杯?
Wonder if you and Mrs. Joseph would care to join me in a drink?

639
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:19,097
你可以拿回你的毛巾了。
You can have your towel back now.

640
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:43,021
深呼吸，丹。我要转动旋钮一会儿。
Take a breather, Dan. I'll turn the knobs awhile.

641
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:45,958
很好，我想睡一会儿。
Good, I could use a little shuteye.

642
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:55,601
有趣的是，一个人能睡在耳边有四个大引擎的轰鸣中，只有在它们停止轰鸣时才会醒来。
Funny thing how a fella can sleep with four big engines hollering in his ears, only wake up when they stop hollering.

643
00:53:56,602 --> 00:54:00,105
想象一下，你在家里被寂静吵醒?
Imagine silence waking you up at home?

644
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:03,108
没有人应该忍受这样的安排。
No human being should have to put up with such an arrangement.

645
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:33,706
旧金山收费员，2930…那个，那个无线电，我不在乎是不是你自己造的。这是违法的!
San Francisco tolls-man, 2930... That, that radio, I don't care if you did build it yourself. It's against the law!

646
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:35,808
在我动手之前把它扔出去!
Throw it overboard before I do!

647
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:37,710
但我喜欢听飞机的声音。
But I like to listen to the airplanes.

648
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:40,979
我花了很长时间才搭好那个布景。
I spent a long time building that set.

649
00:54:41,013 --> 00:54:43,316
你敢碰我的电视机，我就杀了你。
You touch my set and I'll kill you.

650
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,650
反正我也会这么做。
I might do it anyway.

651
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:47,586
就为了让这个生锈的桶发生点什么。
Just to have something happen on this rust bucket.

652
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,888
你疯了。你需要在岸上待六个月!
You're off your rocker. You need six months ashore!

653
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,227
和你同船就足以让任何人发疯了。
Being shipmates with you is enough to drive anybody off their rocker.

654
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,995
滚出去。
Get out of here.

655
00:54:59,698 --> 00:55:01,066
别说我没警告过你。
Don't say I didn't warn you.

656
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:05,203
如果你想在那堆垃圾上发送任何信息联邦通信委员会马上就会吊销你的执照。
The FCC will jerk your license in a minute if you try to send anything on that pile of junk.

657
00:55:05,237 --> 00:55:06,739
哦，少来这套!
Oh, get out of here!

658
00:55:06,772 --> 00:55:08,374
你好,火奴鲁鲁。
Hello, Honolulu.

659
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:10,543
这是420号，有位置报告。
This is 420 with a position report.

660
00:55:10,576 --> 00:55:13,178
加油,火奴鲁鲁!醒来。回答他!
Come on, Honolulu! Wake up. Answer him!

661
00:55:13,211 --> 00:55:15,514
4-2-0，这里是旧金山。
4-2-0, this is San Francisco.

662
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:18,584
火奴鲁鲁无法阅读你，因为条件太差。
Honolulu unable to read you on account of poor conditions.

663
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:20,052
继续写你的报告吧。
Go ahead with your report.

664
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:23,589
-好的，旧金山。-复制,火奴鲁鲁。
- Ok, San Francisco. - Copy, Honolulu.

665
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:25,758
在0557年。
Position at 0557.

666
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,226
北纬34/30。
Latitude 34/30 north.

667
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,398
西经140度，9000英尺。
Longitude 140 west, 9,000 feet.

668
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:34,567
1500加仑。
1,500 gallons remaining.

669
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:57,122
从我身边的窗口，有时我能看到星星。
From the window at my side, sometimes I can see the stars.

670
00:55:57,155 --> 00:56:00,826
美国就在我身边，无处不在。
America is all around me in every way.

671
00:56:06,724 --> 00:56:09,361
你知道一件有趣的事吗?
Do you understand a funny thing?

672
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:16,868
在檀香山，我必须接受美国海关和移民人员的检查。
In Honolulu, I must be inspected by the American customs and immigration persons.

673
00:56:16,901 --> 00:56:20,405
没有一个士兵守着东西。
And not one soldier to guard things.

674
00:56:20,438 --> 00:56:28,646
我到处找带枪的士兵…陈小姐，您现在要吃饭吗?
I look everywhere for soldiers with guns and... Would you like your dinner now, Miss Chen?

675
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,049
哦,是的!求你了，我太蠢了。
Oh, yes! Please, I am so stupid.

676
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:38,022
这是一封给我弟弟的英文信，我不记得这个单词。
Here is a letter to my brother in English and I cannot remember this word.

677
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:43,761
是士兵们在枪口戴的那种东西吗，像剑一样?
It is that thing soldiers wear at the end of their guns, like a sword?

678
00:56:43,795 --> 00:56:45,930
刺刀?啊,是的。
Bayonet? Ah, yes.

679
00:56:45,963 --> 00:56:49,934
我真是太蠢了。谢谢你！
I am so very stupid. Thank you.

680
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:51,803
我尴尬。
I am embarrassed.

681
00:56:51,836 --> 00:56:56,007
任何能读写一种以上语言的人都不应该感到尴尬。
Anyone who can write and read more than one language should never be embarrassed.

682
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,043
作为原创的笨兔子，我自己都写不出来。
Being the original dumb-bunny, I can barely write my own.

683
00:56:59,076 --> 00:57:00,545
傻瓜吗?
Dumb-bunny?

684
00:57:00,578 --> 00:57:03,247
那是对像我这样的弱智美国女孩的俚语。
That's slang for mentally retarded American girls, like me.

685
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:04,982
傻瓜。
Dumb-bunny.

686
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:06,818
傻瓜。
Dumb-bunny.

687
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:08,553
多么令人愉快的!
How delightful!

688
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:10,855
我必须把这件事告诉我哥哥。
I must tell my brother of this.

689
00:57:10,888 --> 00:57:13,591
你告诉他你遇到了最傻的兔子。
You tell him you met the number one stupid rabbit.

690
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:16,428
如果他认识美国女孩，他会理解的。
If he knows any American girls, he'll understand.

691
00:57:16,461 --> 00:57:17,762
现在我去给你拿晚餐。
Now I'll get your dinner.

692
00:57:18,463 --> 00:57:19,897
傻瓜。
Dumb-bunny.

693
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:22,700
傻瓜。
Dumb-bunny.

694
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,805
苏利文上尉，后面有点不对劲。
Captain Sullivan, there's something very wrong back there.

695
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,097
盘……我知道!
The tray... I know!

696
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,032
整个盘子都跳了起来!我自己烧。
A whole tray jumped! I burned myself.

697
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:57,369
我发誓那是第一引擎。
I swear it's that number one engine.

698
00:57:57,402 --> 00:57:59,236
它运行得很完美。
It was running perfectly.

699
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,372
他们都是。
They all are.

700
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:02,139
也许在尾部。
Maybe it's in the tail.

701
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:04,942
如果我们的小女孩被烧伤了，也许后面的情况更糟。
If our little girl got burned, maybe it's worse back there.

702
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:07,512
丹，拿着你的手电筒，从尾部看一看。
Dan, take your flashlight, have a look through the tail.

703
00:58:07,545 --> 00:58:09,514
尽快向我报告。正确的。
Report to me as soon as you can. Right.

704
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:14,318
莱纳德，赶快行动，现在告诉我我们的位置，从现在开始每十分钟告诉我一次。
Leonard, take a fast fix, let me know our position now and every 10 minutes from now.

705
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:16,053
斯伯丁，去找你的乘客。
Spalding, get back to your passengers.

706
00:58:16,087 --> 00:58:18,590
如果这东西再次释放，他们会开始怀疑的。
If this thing lets go again, they'll start wondering.

707
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:24,596
霍比，告诉旧金山那边我们遇到了异常震动等待进一步通知。
Hobie, tell San Francisco we're experiencing some unusual vibration and to stand by until further advised.

708
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:26,029
你要申报紧急情况吗?
Do you want to declare an emergency?

709
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,803
不,还没有。
No, not yet.

710
00:59:23,655 --> 00:59:25,189
一切都好吗?
Is everything all right?

711
00:59:25,222 --> 00:59:26,791
我们仍然完好无损。
We're still in one piece.

712
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:29,494
我刚开始为乘客服务。我应该继续吗?
I was just starting to serve the passengers. Should I go ahead?

713
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,929
你也可以这么做。
You might as well.

714
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:34,999
有时候这些事情永远无法解释。
Sometimes these things never do get explained.

715
00:59:43,074 --> 00:59:44,909
喂，你先挂一下，好吗?
Say, hang up a minute, will you?

716
00:59:44,942 --> 00:59:47,011
告诉我这架飞机出了什么问题。
Tell me what's wrong with this airplane.

717
00:59:47,044 --> 00:59:48,680
有什么问题吗?
Is there something wrong with it?

718
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:50,181
省省吧。
Cut it out.

719
00:59:50,214 --> 00:59:52,950
刚才有东西爆得太猛了，把我的饮料都弄洒了。
Something popped so hard a while ago, it spilled my drink.

720
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:56,282
另一种秩序。我们不会吝啬的。
Order another. We're not stingy.

721
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:58,652
你不会说话?
You won't talk?

722
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:01,621
如果有话要说，我会的。
I would if there was anything to say.

723
01:00:01,655 --> 01:00:04,458
我跟你打个赌，我们去旧金山要晚了。
I'll make you a bet right now, we're late getting into San Francisco.

724
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:08,294
可能是吧。
Could be.

725
01:00:17,537 --> 01:00:19,573
有什么发现吗?不。
Did you find anything? Nope.

726
01:00:19,606 --> 01:00:20,850
你觉得会是什么呢?
Well, what do you suppose it could it be?

727
01:00:20,874 --> 01:00:22,041
难倒我了。我们在哪里?
Beats me. Where are we?

728
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:23,943
过几分钟我再告诉你。
I'll let you know in a couple of minutes.

729
01:00:23,977 --> 01:00:25,679
尾巴没有问题。
Nothing wrong with the tail.

730
01:00:25,712 --> 01:00:29,148
在过去的一小时里一号头部温度上升了五度。
The number one head temperature has gone up five degrees in the past hour.

731
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:33,629
旧金山想知道我们的麻烦是什么。
San Francisco wants to know the nature of our trouble.

732
01:00:33,653 --> 01:00:35,798
告诉他们如果我们知道，我们一开始就会告诉他们。
Tell them if we knew, we'd have told them in the first place.

733
01:00:35,822 --> 01:00:40,069
不，别这么说。告诉他们…就说我们还不知道，然后继续待命。
No, don't say that. Tell them... Just say we still don't know and to keep standing by.

734
01:00:40,093 --> 01:00:41,661
我有消息要告诉你们。
I got news for you guys.

735
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:43,497
我们刚过了不归路。
We just passed the point of no return.

736
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:06,386
你丢了什么东西吗，阿格纽先生?
Have you lost something, Mr. Agnew?

737
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,988
我的打火机没油了。
My, uh, lighter is out of fluid.

738
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:21,294
也许他以为自己是在船上，想要激发出晚餐的胃口。
Maybe he thinks he's aboard ship and is trying to work up an appetite for dinner.

739
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:23,463
我见过一个疯子那样做。
I seen a crazy man act like that once.

740
01:02:23,497 --> 01:02:24,998
不是很好。
It ain't so nice.

741
01:02:25,031 --> 01:02:26,466
他是在自找麻烦。
He's looking for trouble.

742
01:02:33,006 --> 01:02:35,441
你是肯尼斯·蔡尔兹，对吗?
You're Kenneth Childs, aren't you?

743
01:02:35,475 --> 01:02:37,243
那不是你的名字吗?
Well, isn't that your name?

744
01:02:37,276 --> 01:02:39,345
是的。为什么?
Yeah. Why?

745
01:02:39,378 --> 01:02:40,714
我想我们以前没见过面。
I don't think we've met before.

746
01:02:40,747 --> 01:02:43,449
不。我们没见面是因为没人想让我们见面。
No. We've not met because no one wanted us to.

747
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:46,986
有什么能帮你的吗?
Well, what can I do for you?

748
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:49,055
我叫汉弗莱·阿格纽。
My name is Humphrey Agnew.

749
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,392
这对你有什么意义吗?
Well, does that mean anything to you?

750
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,631
阿格纽。你是玛莎的丈夫。
Agnew. You're Martha's husband.

751
01:02:57,664 --> 01:03:00,099
我是。
I am.

752
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:02,502
我可没听你说见到我很高兴。
Well, I didn't hear you say you were pleased to meet me.

753
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,305
当然……当然不是!
Well, of course... Of course not!

754
01:03:08,474 --> 01:03:12,445
阿格纽先生，这位女士和我正在安静地喝一杯。
Look, Mr. Agnew, this lady and I are having a quiet drink together.

755
01:03:12,478 --> 01:03:14,280
你好像有什么心事。
You seem to be disturbed about something.

756
01:03:14,313 --> 01:03:21,054
也许我们可以稍后再谈。现在，如果你不介意…哦,不!你不能打个响指就把我送走。
Perhaps we can talk later. Now, if you'll excuse... Oh, no! You don't just snap your fingers and send me on my way.

757
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,824
阿格纽先生，我不知道你在吃什么，坦白说，我也不在乎。
Mr. Agnew, I don't know what's eating you, and frankly, I don't care.

758
01:03:24,858 --> 01:03:27,727
你为什么不从哪儿来就回哪儿去，坐下来?
Why don't you go back wherever you came from and sit down?

759
01:03:27,761 --> 01:03:29,696
哦，现在，亲爱的。
Oh, now, now, honey.

760
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:31,164
这个人很讨厌。
Well, this man's a nuisance.

761
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:33,132
我肯定是个讨厌鬼。
I've no doubt I'm a nuisance.

762
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:39,606
当你和我妻子在火奴鲁鲁想方设法避开我，好让你们独处时，我一定是个更大的麻烦。
And I must have been an even greater nuisance when you and my wife were scheming to avoid me in Honolulu so you could be alone.

763
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:41,207
你疯了!
You're right out of your head!

764
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:45,413
我请你妻子吃过两次午饭，因为她是个很好的女孩。
I took your wife to lunch twice because she was a very nice girl.

765
01:03:46,548 --> 01:03:49,217
很久以前，她碰巧为我工作。
And a long time ago she happened to work for me.

766
01:03:49,251 --> 01:03:52,154
她所犯的最大的罪就是和我握手。
The worst crime she is guilty of is shaking my hand.

767
01:03:52,187 --> 01:03:55,823
别再侮辱她了，别再出洋相了。击败它。
Now stop insulting her and making a fool of yourself. Beat it.

768
01:03:55,857 --> 01:03:58,793
我就知道你会有奇特的解释。
I knew you'd have some fancy explanation.

769
01:03:58,826 --> 01:04:02,597
但我不像你和我妻子认为的那样傻。
But I'm not such a fool as you and my wife think I am.

770
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,967
现在，我想让你们知道我要做什么。
Now, I'm going to let you wonder what I'm going to do.

771
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,172
想啊想啊想啊想，就像我一直在做的那样。
Wonder and think and think and think, as I've been doing.

772
01:04:10,205 --> 01:04:14,108
我多年来一直听说过你，我讨厌听到你的名字!
I've heard about you for years and I'm sick of the sound your name!

773
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,578
你在女人面前真是个征服者，不是吗?
You're quite a conqueror with the ladies, aren't you?

774
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:18,413
夫人，您应该会感兴趣的。
That should interest you, madam.

775
01:04:18,446 --> 01:04:20,682
我受够了!
I've had enough of this!

776
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:21,925
你们是怎么了?
What's the matter with you guys?

777
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:23,161
嘿，这是怎么回事?
Hey, what's this all about?

778
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:24,619
放松，别打了!
Easy, break it up!

779
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,920
他疯了，他有枪!
He's crazy, he's got a gun!

780
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:37,265
我们在火!
We're on fire!

781
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:42,580
把瓶子拉上去!
Pull the bottle on it!

782
01:04:42,604 --> 01:04:44,306
霍比，快把瓶子拉出来!
Yeah, Hobie, pull the bottle quick!

783
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,414
用无线电。告诉旧金山!
Get on the radio. Tell San Francisco!

784
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:53,815
旧金山420…
San Francisco 420...

785
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,520
道具!整个道具都不见了!
The prop! The whole prop's gone!

786
01:04:58,553 --> 01:05:00,222
是的，你的引擎也会掉的!
Yes, and you may lose your engine, too!

787
01:05:00,255 --> 01:05:01,356
她情绪不太好。
She's off her mountings.

788
01:05:01,389 --> 01:05:03,100
丹，把另一个瓶子拉出来。旧金山,420 !
Pull the other bottle, Dan. San Francisco, 420!

789
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:04,192
我要去喝水了。
I'm starting for the water.

790
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:06,628
旧金山，旧金山420。
San Francisco, San Francisco 420.

791
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:21,008
谢谢你，亲爱的主。
Thank you, sweet Lord.

792
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,311
我觉得她不会再被烧伤了。
I don't think she's gonna burn anymore.

793
01:05:23,345 --> 01:05:25,112
我不能抚养旧金山。静态的。
I can't raise San Francisco. Static.

794
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:27,090
试试次级频率。两种我都试过了。
Try the secondary frequency. I've been trying them both.

795
01:05:27,114 --> 01:05:28,850
使用紧急!给他们打求救电话。
Use emergency! Give them a mayday call.

796
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,952
我们要下水了吗?不!
Are we going into the water? No!

797
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:34,622
引擎挂着，她飞得很糟糕但我想我们可以继续飞行。
She flies lousy with that engine hanging down but I think we can stay in the air.

798
01:05:34,656 --> 01:05:36,624
到海岸还有多久?6个小时,。
How long to the coast? Six hours, about.

799
01:05:36,658 --> 01:05:38,135
但那是正常的巡航速度。
But that was at regular cruising speed.

800
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:39,603
我还没想好怎么对付这种事。
I've not figured it out for this sort of thing.

801
01:05:39,627 --> 01:05:40,995
好吧,图!
Well, figure it!

802
01:05:41,028 --> 01:05:43,130
420年五月天。
Mayday 420.

803
01:05:43,729 --> 01:05:45,664
420年五月天,任何人。任何人。
Mayday 420, anybody. Anybody.

804
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:49,768
我得到了别人。我得到了别人。一艘船!
I got somebody. I got somebody. A ship!

805
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:52,804
我是克里斯托瓦尔交易员，呼叫420。
This is The Cristobal Trader calling 420.

806
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:54,973
我听得很清楚。
I can hear you very clearly.

807
01:05:55,006 --> 01:05:58,009
你20分钟前从我身边走过。
You passed right over me about 20 minutes ago.

808
01:05:58,043 --> 01:06:01,280
你想让我转达你所有的留言吗?结束了。
Do you want me to relay all your messages? Over.

809
01:06:01,313 --> 01:06:05,417
罗杰。通知旧金山，我们失去了一号螺旋桨。
Roger. Advise San Francisco we've lost number one propeller.

810
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:07,586
起火了，但现已扑灭。
Fire started but is now out.

811
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:10,055
我们现在有5000，但是正在下沉。
We are now at 5,000, but sinking.

812
01:06:10,088 --> 01:06:12,524
请求飞越我们以下所有高度。结束了。
Request they clear all altitudes below us. Over.

813
01:06:13,225 --> 01:06:14,960
会做的事情。站在。
Will do. Stand by.

814
01:06:16,128 --> 01:06:19,565
我是克里斯托瓦尔贸易公司，呼叫旧金山。
This is Cristobal Trader calling San Francisco.

815
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,263
奥克兰控制中心完成海上救援。
Clear sea rescue from Oakland control.

816
01:06:56,902 --> 01:06:58,103
正确的。
Right.

817
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:06,077
-预热准备好的飞机。——拦截。
- Warm up the ready plane. - Intercept.

818
01:07:28,934 --> 01:07:31,870
旧金山想知道你是否打算放弃。完毕。

San Francisco wants to know if you are going to ditch. Over.

819
01:07:31,903 --> 01:07:33,205
暂时没有。
Negative for now.

820
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:36,141
为了以防万一，你的海况如何？完毕。

What's the state of the sea about you, just in case? Over.

821
01:07:36,174 --> 01:07:37,709
西北部的巨浪。
Heavy northwest swells.

822
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:39,745
我们在旋转30度。
We are rolling about 30 degrees.

823
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:41,247
很粗糙。
It's very rough.

824
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,682
尽量让船飞起来，孩子。
Keep that ship in the air if you can, boy.

825
01:07:43,715 --> 01:07:46,117
这里很潮湿。完毕。
It's wet down here. Over.

826
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:48,387
谢谢你，Cristobal Trader。我们试一试。
Thank you, Cristobal Trader. We'll try.

827
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:50,789
干得好,爸爸!
Attaboy, papa!

828
01:07:56,362 --> 01:08:00,065
总有一天，我会变聪明，回到按钮上!
Some of these days, I'm gonna get smart and go back to buttons!

829
01:08:00,098 --> 01:08:01,267
屎是什么?
What's the poop?

830
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,602
东行失去了一个支柱。生过火，但已经熄灭了。
Eastbound lost a prop. Had a fire but that's out.

831
01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:05,613
看来他是去喝酒了。他还有多远?
Looks like he's headed for the drink. How far out is he?

832
01:08:05,637 --> 01:08:06,872
也许1000英里。
1,000 miles maybe.

833
01:08:06,905 --> 01:08:08,440
哦，我的眼睛好疼!
Oh, my achin' eyes!

834
01:08:25,657 --> 01:08:30,396
这可能是我的最后一场演出，而不是一场搞笑的演出。
This might well be my last show, and not a laugh in it.

835
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:32,964
我不该尖叫的，但我太害怕了。
I shouldn't have screamed, but I was so scared.

836
01:08:32,998 --> 01:08:35,967
我自己的心刚从天花板上回来。
My own heart is just returning from the ceiling.

837
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:37,135
麻烦吗?
Troubles?

838
01:08:37,168 --> 01:08:39,638
等我把这事告诉好邻居们。
Wait till I tell the Good Neighbors about this.

839
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:43,141
有人开香槟时，我几乎睡着了。
I was almost asleep when someone pulled the champagne cork.

840
01:08:43,174 --> 01:08:44,910
这可能会变得有趣。
This could become interesting.

841
01:08:44,943 --> 01:08:47,255
在这之前，一切都很有趣，亲爱的。
Things were pretty interesting before this happened, dearie.

842
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,281
两只猿猴想要杀死对方!
Two apes were trying to kill each other!

843
01:08:49,315 --> 01:08:51,950
你为什么不乖乖地回去坐下呢?
Now why don't you be a good boy and go back and sit down?

844
01:08:51,983 --> 01:08:54,052
我相信一切都会好起来的。
I'm sure everything will be all right.

845
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:57,088
他们马上会从飞行甲板回来解释。
They'll come back from the flight deck and explain in a minute.

846
01:08:57,122 --> 01:09:00,392
我会帮你保管这个直到我们到达旧金山。
I'm just gonna keep this for you till we make San Francisco.

847
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:03,128
这种事会给你带来很多麻烦的。
You can get in plenty trouble with them things.

848
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:04,696
我去给大家倒咖啡。
I'll get coffee for everyone.

849
01:09:09,401 --> 01:09:11,703
你知道太空枪不会杀了你吗?
Did you know space guns don't kill you?

850
01:09:11,737 --> 01:09:12,804
不。
No.

851
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:14,573
它们只会让你变得僵硬。
They just make you stiff.

852
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:32,336
最有趣的是这是我人生中第一次，我是无辜的。
You know, the funny part of all this is that for the first time in my whole life, I'm innocent.

853
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,573
我告诉他的都是实话，我发誓。
What I told him was the truth, so help me.

854
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,453
这要花纳税人一大笔钱。
This is gonna cost the taxpayers a lot of money.

855
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,021
你想让他们怎么做?游泳回家吗?
What would you have them do? Swim home?

856
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:54,824
你好，阿拉米达，这里是海岸警卫队救援协调中心。
Hello, Alameda, this is the Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center.

857
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:42,706
新职位,队长!
New position, Skipper!

858
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,207
的名字!
Name it!

859
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,252
如果我们能保持这样的飞行速度，还有五小时四十七分钟就能到达海岸。
To the coast, five hours and 47 minutes, if we can hold this air speed.

860
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:47,377
我们的燃料怎么样?
How's our fuel?

861
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:50,246
足够了。而已。
Enough. Just.

862
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:54,017
我们只需要1150加仑，图上是1300加仑。
We'll only need about 1,150 gallons, we've 1,300 according to my graph.

863
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,796
它把东西夹得很紧……你可以把你的图表扔掉了，伦尼。嗯?
It's pinching things close... You can throw your graph away, Lennie. Huh?

864
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,622
因为我们没有1300加仑。
Because we haven't got 1,300 gallons.

865
01:10:58,655 --> 01:10:59,723
你怎么知道的?
How do you figure that?

866
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:04,160
第一个油箱，我们失去道具的时候显示是200加仑。
The number one tank, it read 200 gallons when we lost our prop.

867
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:09,399
我猜当道具离开我们的时候，它在机翼上踢了几个洞。水箱破裂。
My guess is that when the prop left us, it kicked holes in the wing. Ruptured the tank.

868
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:10,900
(这样做我们做不到。)
We can't make it this way.

869
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:14,738
我会再想出办法的，但是风向，风向，也许会改变一些。
I'll figure it up again, but the winds, the winds, maybe they'll change some.

870
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,306
我们要去喝酒了。
We're going into the drink.

871
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,675
只是时间和地点的问题。
It's just a question of when and where.

872
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:19,943
我们有足够的时间。
We've got plenty of time.

873
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:22,879
我们不要为了这件事匆忙离开。
Let's not rush off into the heat of the day about this.

874
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,081
我们再等一会儿，看看风向如何。
Let's hold on a while and see what the wind does.

875
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,526
那样我们离海岸更近。
That way we'll be closer to the coast.

876
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,917
海岸的水会更冷。
Water will be colder on the coast.

877
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:32,221
可能会更粗糙，但我还是觉得我们应该尽可能延长时间。
And probably rougher, but I still think we should stretch it out as long as we can.

878
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:36,259
如果我在这一点上同意你的话，我们就有更多的时间来解决问题。
If I go along with you on that, it'll give us more time to get squared away.

879
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,195
当我们真正开始的时候，我希望你和我一起上来。
I want you up here with me when we really start down.

880
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,964
同时，把你能拿的东西都拿下来。
Meantime, get everything you can overboard.

881
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,833
1000磅左右会让我们的速度有所不同。
A 1,000 pounds or so will make a difference in our speed.

882
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:46,202
你要我告诉他们他们要去喝酒吗?
You want me to tell 'em they're going into the drink?

883
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,873
用你自己的判断。
Use your own judgment.

884
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:22,606
我想不用我告诉你们吧我们遇到了点小麻烦。
I guess I don't have to tell you people that we've had a little trouble.

885
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:28,878
也许如果我解释一下到底发生了什么，大家都会感觉好点。
Maybe if I explain exactly what has happened, you'll feel better all around.

886
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:34,350
我不会把它最小化也不会让它变得更复杂。
I'm not gonna minimize it nor will I make it any tougher than it really is.

887
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:56,623
我们失去了一号螺旋桨。
Now, we've lost our number one propeller.

888
01:12:56,656 --> 01:13:04,464
这只是那些从未发生但十亿英里飞行中才会发生的事情之一。
This is just one of those things that never happens but does once in a billion flying miles.

889
01:13:04,498 --> 01:13:09,536
我们已经用二氧化碳把火扑灭了，所以不会再有危险了。
We've extinguished the fire with the carbon dioxide, so there's no further danger from that.

890
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:19,112
但我们的速度被大大减慢了因为一号发动机在安装过程中部分扭曲造成了严重的阻力。
But our speed has been considerably slowed down because the number one motor is partially twisted in its mountings causing a severe drag.

891
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,349
有点像划艇拖着你的脚。
Sort of like draggin' your feet in a rowboat.

892
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:29,756
如果你有点害怕，我不能怪你，我也是。
I can't blame you if you are a little scared, I am, too.

893
01:13:29,789 --> 01:13:36,363
我从1917年就开始坐飞机了，我和你一样不喜欢这种事情。
I've been flying since 1917, and I don't like this sort of thing any better than you do.

894
01:13:36,396 --> 01:13:41,435
然而，在飞翔的过程中，你会发现我仍然活得好好的。
However, with all that flying, you'll notice that I'm still very much alive.

895
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,474
现在是最难的部分。
Now comes the hard part.

896
01:13:48,074 --> 01:13:49,108
你能接受吗?
Can you take it?

897
01:13:49,142 --> 01:13:51,445
请告诉我们一切。
Please, tell us everything.

898
01:13:53,146 --> 01:13:54,614
我想我们都想知道。
I think we all want to know.

899
01:14:11,565 --> 01:14:12,866
我们真的很幸运。
We're really very lucky.

900
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:16,536
那个螺旋桨可能会造成更大的破坏。
That propeller could have done a great deal more damage.

901
01:14:17,571 --> 01:14:22,476
总之，机翼上有几个洞，那是储存燃料的地方。
Anyway, there are several holes in the wing, that's where our fuel is stored.

902
01:14:22,509 --> 01:14:26,346
也就是说我们无法到达加州海岸。
Which means that we can't quite make the California coast.

903
01:14:28,782 --> 01:14:30,450
我们不能回火奴鲁鲁吗?
Well, can't we go back to Honolulu?

904
01:14:30,484 --> 01:14:34,153
事情发生的时候，我们已经到了不能回头的地步。
We'd already passed the point of no return when it happened.

905
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:36,990
我们可能不得不让这架飞机在海里迫降。
We will probably have to ditch this plane in the sea.

906
01:14:37,023 --> 01:14:39,859
我们都会被杀的!我们都会被杀的!
We'll all be killed! We'll all be killed!

907
01:14:41,795 --> 01:14:45,565
现在有可能你只会在水里待几分钟。
Now there's just a chance that you'll only be in the water a few minutes.

908
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:48,802
已经有架救援飞机来拦截我们了。
There's a rescue plane already on its way to intercept us.

909
01:14:48,835 --> 01:14:52,472
在我们真正进去之前，可能会有更多的。
And before we actually have to go in, there'll probably be several more.

910
01:14:52,506 --> 01:14:54,841
其中一些可以降落在水面上。
Some of which can land on water.

911
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:58,044
水面舰艇会向我们驶来。
And surface vessels will be directed toward us.

912
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:08,888
以前也有过飞机落水的情况，没有人受过轻伤，除了可能有点受潮。
Airplanes have gone into the water before and no one received the slightest injury, except maybe a little dampening.

913
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:10,724
伤亡来自恐慌。
Casualties come from panic.

914
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:13,560
所以你不能着急。
So you must not hurry.

915
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:19,433
斯伯丁小姐和我们的二副，惠勒先生，会回来陪你。照他们说的做。
Miss Spalding and our second officer, Mr. Wheeler, will be back here with you. Do exactly as they tell you.

916
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:28,475
众所周知，飞机漂浮的时间太长了，它们对航行构成了威胁，不得不被炮火击沉。
Airplanes have been known to float for so long that they became a menace to navigation and had to be sunk by gunfire.

917
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:30,477
它们也曾在几分钟内沉没。
They've been known to sink in a few minutes, too.

918
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:47,167
这是一个充气的救生筏。
This is an inflatable life raft.

919
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,769
这真是一个很棒的小玩意。
It's really a wonderful gadget.

920
01:15:48,802 --> 01:15:51,505
除了丁字骨牛排什么都有。
It's got everything in it but T-bone steaks.

921
01:15:51,538 --> 01:15:53,474
它会让你们所有人都很舒服。
It will hold all of you very comfortably.

922
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,410
惠勒先生，我们的二副，将负责。
Mr. Wheeler, our second officer, will be in charge.

923
01:15:56,443 --> 01:15:58,912
他会告诉你什么时候脱鞋。
He will tell you when to take off your shoes.

924
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:01,415
我们不想让任何人在筏子上踢洞。
We don't want anybody kickin' holes in this raft.

925
01:16:01,448 --> 01:16:05,952
如果你饿了，斯伯丁小姐会告诉你紧急口粮在哪里。
Miss Spalding will show you where the emergency rations are when you get hungry.

926
01:16:05,986 --> 01:16:09,290
如果我们只在救生艇上待几分钟我们怎么可能饿呢?
Well, how are we gonna get hungry if we're only gonna be in the raft a few minutes?

927
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:11,325
你不是在胡说八道吗?
Aren't you giving us a lot of malarkey?

928
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:17,097
也许有一点吧，但我们不希望有人说这架飞机的服务和烹饪不好。
Well, maybe a little, but we just don't want bad things said about the service and cuisine on this airline.

929
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,865
毫无疑问会有鱼子酱。
No doubt there'll be caviar.

930
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,068
如果没有鱼子酱，那将是最艰难的。
It would be most arduous if there were no caviar.

931
01:16:22,102 --> 01:16:24,070
我去找急救厨师
I'll speak to the emergency chef.

932
01:16:24,104 --> 01:16:26,273
我不认为这是什么可以开玩笑的事。
I don't think this is anything to joke about.

933
01:16:26,307 --> 01:16:28,875
你错了!笑话越多越好。
You're wrong! The more jokes, the better.

934
01:16:28,909 --> 01:16:32,279
等你上了救生艇，你甚至可以试着唱歌。
When you get in that raft, you might even try singing.

935
01:16:32,313 --> 01:16:34,381
我曾经是一名普通的低音提琴手。
Well, I was once a fair-to-middling bass.

936
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:37,618
我不能在篮子里放曲子，但我肯定声音很大。
I can't carry a tune in a basket, but I'm sure loud.

937
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:40,954
这一点非常重要。
Now, this is very important.

938
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:44,090
当我们真正进入时，会有两种冲击。
When we actually go in, there will be two shocks.

939
01:16:44,124 --> 01:16:47,160
如果你提前知道他们，他们就不会吓到你。
If you know about them in advance, they won't frighten you.

940
01:16:47,193 --> 01:16:50,697
第一次是很难察觉的，就像正常着陆一样。
The first will be hardly noticeable, like a normal landing.

941
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:54,167
但第二种情况可能相当严重，所以做好准备。
But the second may be quite severe, so brace yourselves.

942
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,873
过不了多久，灯就灭了，但斯伯丁小姐和惠勒先生都有手电筒。
Soon after that, the lights will go out, but Miss Spalding and Mr. Wheeler both have flashlights.

943
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:03,344
所以，解开安全带，等他的电话。
So, unfasten your seat belts and wait for his call.

944
01:17:03,377 --> 01:17:05,346
并且保持冷静。
And keep calm.

945
01:17:05,379 --> 01:17:07,748
你还有什么不明白的吗?
Now, is there anything you don't understand?

946
01:17:07,781 --> 01:17:10,150
我们能给家人发个无线电信息吗?
Could we send a radio message to our families?

947
01:17:10,183 --> 01:17:11,852
他们要去机场接我们。
They were gonna meet us at the airport.

948
01:17:11,885 --> 01:17:13,219
他们只是站着。
They will just be standing.

949
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:18,692
抱歉，我们的无线电正忙着告知我们的位置并联系救援飞机。
I'm sorry, our radio is extremely busy giving our position and contacting the rescue plane.

950
01:17:18,725 --> 01:17:22,228
我的公文包里有一些重要文件，多年的工作成果。
I've some important papers in my briefcase, many years of work.

951
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:24,197
我可以把它们带走吗?
Can I take them with me?

952
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:26,667
除非你能把它们塞进口袋。
Not unless you can stuff them in your pockets.

953
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,135
没有任何行李。
No baggage of any kind.

954
01:17:29,169 --> 01:17:33,574
仔细想想，海底才是它们最好的地方。
Come to think about it, the bottom of the sea is the best place for them.

955
01:17:35,175 --> 01:17:37,010
还有一点。
And one thing more.

956
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:39,279
现在，别抱太大希望。
Now, don't get your hopes up.

957
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:43,016
我们只有千分之一的机会能到达海岸。
There is one chance in a thousand that we can make the coast.

958
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:46,319
除非风向有明显变化，否则这是不可能的。
This isn't possible unless there is a marked change in the wind.

959
01:17:46,353 --> 01:17:49,222
根据我们的预测，这是不可能发生的。
And according to our forecast, it just couldn't happen.

960
01:17:49,255 --> 01:17:50,757
但它可能。
But it could.

961
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,928
我们现在能做的唯一一件事就是减轻船的重量。
And the one thing we can do right now to help matters is to lighten ship.

962
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:56,963
这样我们就会少用一点燃料。
That way we'll use slightly less fuel.

963
01:17:58,134 --> 01:18:04,807
所以，如果你们当中有谁曾有过想把东西扔出窗外的冲动，这是你们千载难逢的机会。
So, if any of you gentlemen have ever had an urge to throw things out of windows, this is your chance of a lifetime.

964
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:07,910
那我们这些女孩呢?我喜欢扔东西。
Well, what about us girls? I love to throw things.

965
01:18:07,944 --> 01:18:10,146
很好，回去帮斯伯丁小姐。
Good, go back and help Miss Spalding.

966
01:18:12,549 --> 01:18:13,692
我最好还是和妻子在一起。
I'd better stick with the wife.

967
01:18:13,716 --> 01:18:15,785
她非常担心我们的孩子。
She's awfully worried about our children.

968
01:18:16,919 --> 01:18:18,888
求你了，让我帮你。
Please, let me help.

969
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:20,423
我要告航空公司!
I'll sue the airline for this!

970
01:18:20,457 --> 01:18:21,858
我不应该强迫自己。
I'm not supposed to exert myself.

971
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:26,329
医生说我的心脏…你的心伤了我的心。
The doctor says my heart... Your heart is breaking my heart.

972
01:18:26,363 --> 01:18:33,303
我们可以把这些包袱甩掉如果你们先生们跟我走剩下的人排好队，退到门口去!
We can get rid of some of this baggage if you gentlemen will come along with me and the rest of you form a line, clear back to the door!

973
01:19:34,063 --> 01:19:36,433
我的新梅因波彻连衣裙在这里。
My new Mainbocher frock is in here.

974
01:19:36,466 --> 01:19:38,535
保险公司不会喜欢这样的。
The insurance company isn't gonna like this.

975
01:19:52,081 --> 01:19:54,684
这真是个买新衣柜的好借口。
What a wonderful excuse to get a new wardrobe.

976
01:21:10,727 --> 01:21:16,633
如果他经历了这一切却对此一无所知，那就太好了。
Be kind of nice if he came through all this and didn't know a thing about it.

977
01:21:17,299 --> 01:21:18,367
哦!
Oh!

978
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:20,036
我需要个大块头!
I need a big man!

979
01:21:22,038 --> 01:21:23,673
感兴趣吗?着迷!
Interested? Fascinated!

980
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:25,274
抓住我的腰!
Grab me around the waist!

981
01:21:43,826 --> 01:21:47,129
我会把东西踢出去的，但你要小心!
I'll start kickin' things out, but be careful!

982
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:49,165
保持在我身后!
Keep behind me!

983
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:51,067
外面很寂寞。
It's lonesome out there.

984
01:22:39,616 --> 01:22:40,883
哎哟!
Ouch!

985
01:22:59,769 --> 01:23:01,170
它。
That does it.

986
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:09,078
现在我们要做的就是等待。
Now all we have to do is wait.

987
01:23:12,314 --> 01:23:13,583
原谅我。
Excuse me.

988
01:23:25,962 --> 01:23:29,031
我的孩子们，他们喜欢听我演奏。
My kids, they like to hear me play this.

989
01:24:10,539 --> 01:24:12,575
你不回我们的座位吗?
Aren't you coming back to our seat?

990
01:24:12,609 --> 01:24:13,910
我呆在这里。
I'm staying here.

991
01:24:13,943 --> 01:24:16,245
我不能忍受那条哭泣的毛巾!
I can't stand that crying towel!

992
01:25:21,223 --> 01:25:24,192
霍比，每分钟2250转。
Hobie, give me 2,250 RPM.

993
01:25:28,163 --> 01:25:29,331
打开罩盖。
Crack the cowl flaps.

994
01:25:29,365 --> 01:25:30,966
注意头的温度!
Watch those head temperatures!

995
01:25:36,472 --> 01:25:38,840
再推我一英寸!
Give me another inch of boost!

996
01:25:38,874 --> 01:25:41,810
看看燃料，船长，流量计，我们在往里面倒。
Look at the fuel, Skipper, the flow meters, we're pouring it in.

997
01:25:41,843 --> 01:25:43,178
我没办法。
I can't help it.

998
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:44,889
这气流减慢了我们的速度，我们爬不出来!
This turbulence is slowing us down and we can't climb out of it!

999
01:25:58,527 --> 01:25:59,928
喝杯咖啡。
Have a cup of coffee.

1000
01:26:00,629 --> 01:26:02,197
我现在够性感了。
I'm plenty hot enough now.

1001
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,999
那它会让你冷静下来的。
Well, then it will cool you off.

1002
01:26:13,575 --> 01:26:16,312
你当然担心了，约瑟夫夫人。
Of course you're worried, Mrs. Joseph.

1003
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:19,548
但我很确定我们会平安无事的。
But I'm quite certain we'll get out of this all right.

1004
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:23,184
明天我们就可以把它当作有趣的经历来回顾了。
Why, by tomorrow we can look back on it as an interesting experience.

1005
01:26:24,219 --> 01:26:27,389
顺便问一下，你的孩子都多大了?
By the by, how old are your children?

1006
01:26:27,423 --> 01:26:31,159
詹妮弗六岁，爱德华四岁。
Jennifer is six and Edward is four.

1007
01:26:31,192 --> 01:26:34,095
詹妮弗真是个讨人喜欢的名字，约瑟夫夫人。
Jennifer is such a delightful name, Mrs. Joseph.

1008
01:26:34,129 --> 01:26:36,865
你真幸运。
How fortunate you are.

1009
01:26:36,898 --> 01:26:49,244
詹妮弗总是给我带来…这使人联想到苏格兰荒野石南，巨大的和平和依偎在山丘上的小村庄的景象。
Jennifer has always brought to me the... The suggestion of the Scottish moor heather, great peace and visions of little villages nestled against the hills.

1010
01:26:49,277 --> 01:26:51,380
诸如此类的事情。
That sort of thing.

1011
01:26:51,413 --> 01:26:53,281
你的珍妮佛也像那样吗?
Is your Jennifer anything like that?

1012
01:26:54,383 --> 01:26:58,587
我，我不知道你的确切意思，但她一直是个安静的孩子。
I, I don't know exactly what you mean, but she's always been a quiet child.

1013
01:26:58,620 --> 01:26:59,755
精确!
Precisely!

1014
01:26:59,788 --> 01:27:03,091
不知怎么的，我就知道你的詹妮弗会这样。
Somehow I knew your Jennifer would be like that.

1015
01:27:03,124 --> 01:27:06,862
而爱德华，我毫不怀疑，成长得如此之快，你连给他买鞋都买不起。
And Edward, I've no doubt, is growing so fast you can't buy shoes for him.

1016
01:27:08,129 --> 01:27:09,765
每三周。
Every three weeks.

1017
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:14,836
哦!你现在为什么不试着休息呢?
Oh! Why don't you try to rest now?

1018
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:18,039
以后，我想多听听你孩子的事。
Later, I'd like to hear a great deal more about your children.

1019
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,919
我以为你不喜欢提到孩子?
I thought you hated the mere mention of children?

1020
01:27:30,952 --> 01:27:32,087
我做的事。
I do.

1021
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,456
但那个可怜的女人吓坏了。
But that poor woman is terrified.

1022
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:37,025
我想我帮了她。
I think I helped her.

1023
01:27:37,058 --> 01:27:42,831
10年来，你一直说爱是字典里的一个词，孩子是怪物。
For 10 years you've said that love was a word in the dictionary and children were monsters.

1024
01:27:42,864 --> 01:27:45,867
而你从来不会去帮助别人。
And you would never go two inches out of your way to help anybody.

1025
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:48,904
是什么,古斯塔夫?
What goes, Gustave?

1026
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:54,410
我从没见过你这样。
I've never seen you this way.

1027
01:27:54,443 --> 01:27:57,045
你已经忘了自己整整一个小时了。
You've forgotten yourself for a whole hour.

1028
01:27:57,078 --> 01:28:00,382
你是华丽的。
You've been magnificent.

1029
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:04,453
夸张是一种愚蠢的放纵，莉莉安。
Exaggeration is a foolish indulgence, Lillian.

1030
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:07,489
你跟那个女人说我们会平安无事的。
You told that woman we'd get out of this all right.

1031
01:28:07,523 --> 01:28:08,890
你真的相信吗?
Do you really believe that?

1032
01:28:08,924 --> 01:28:09,991
不。
No.

1033
01:28:10,025 --> 01:28:13,962
不管那个飞行员说了什么，我认为我们正面临一个非常棘手的问题。
In spite of what that pilot said, I think we're batting at a very sticky wicket.

1034
01:28:14,696 --> 01:28:16,532
你却不害怕?
And yet you're not afraid?

1035
01:28:16,565 --> 01:28:18,333
是的,没有。
Yes and no.

1036
01:28:18,366 --> 01:28:20,802
我不确定我是什么感觉。
I'm not sure just how I feel.

1037
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:25,173
如果我现在公开害怕，其他一些人可能也会这样。
If I were openly afraid now, some of the others might become so.

1038
01:28:25,206 --> 01:28:31,112
火灾发生后我做了最廉价的表演现在看来，我被困住了。
I was guilty of the cheapest theatrics right after the fire and now it seems, I'm stuck with it.

1039
01:28:32,581 --> 01:28:34,916
我只想知道一件事。
I just want to know one thing.

1040
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:37,953
世界上最大的婴儿怎么了?
What happened to the biggest baby in the world?

1041
01:28:37,986 --> 01:28:41,423
那个不敢关着灯睡觉的小男孩。
The child-man who was afraid to sleep with the lights off.

1042
01:28:41,457 --> 01:28:46,595
过去，如果洗衣店给你的衬衫上了浆，或者绉缎做得不熟，你就会泪流满面。
You used to burst into tears if the laundry put starch in your shirts or the crepe suzette was underdone.

1043
01:28:47,663 --> 01:28:49,598
我不理解你，古斯塔夫。
I don't understand you, Gustave.

1044
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:53,334
我想，我永远也不会。
I guess, I never will.

1045
01:28:53,368 --> 01:28:55,771
也许理解你并不重要。
Maybe it isn't important to understand you.

1046
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:01,443
就像你一直设法留住的其他女人一样。
Like the other women you've always managed to keep around.

1047
01:29:03,411 --> 01:29:08,216
我试着告诉自己，我和一个复古的罗马皇帝做了交易。
I've tried to tell myself I made a bargain with a throwback, a Roman emperor.

1048
01:29:09,618 --> 01:29:17,793
你在市场上买了我，古斯塔夫，你花钱买我就像你花钱买一出你认为会有好结果的戏一样。
You bought me on the market, Gustave, paid for me like you might pay for a play which you thought might turn out well.

1049
01:29:19,828 --> 01:29:24,700
10年来，我一直带着这种想法生活，并讨厌它。
For 10 years I've lived with that thought and hated it.

1050
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:28,770
现在，它再也不会困扰我了。
Now, it'll never bother me again.

1051
01:29:36,878 --> 01:29:39,214
古斯塔夫，有件事我想告诉你。
Gustave, there is something I'd like to tell you.

1052
01:29:39,247 --> 01:29:44,219
如果我们逃不出去，我希望你能知道得更多。
And if we don't get out of this, I, I'd like you to know it even more.

1053
01:29:45,654 --> 01:29:51,527
我以前从没说过，也许你也不想让我再说一次。
I've never said it before, and probably you'll never want me to say it again.

1054
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:54,062
你那变态的脑子里还在想什么，莉莉安?
What else is on your twisted little mind, Lillian?

1055
01:29:58,834 --> 01:30:00,836
我爱上你了，古斯塔夫。
I'm in love with you, Gustave.

1056
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:05,741
我想我一直都是。
I guess I always have been.

1057
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,214
嗯。
Hmm.

1058
01:30:16,051 --> 01:30:18,954
然后像这样绑好丝带。
And then you tie the ribbons like this.

1059
01:30:18,987 --> 01:30:21,990
这些保鲜剂现在没有充气。
These preservers are not inflated now.

1060
01:30:22,023 --> 01:30:29,297
如果你拉动绳子的任何一边，二氧化碳就会从胶囊中释放出来，背心就会立即膨胀起来。
If you jerk this cord on either side, carbon dioxide will be released from the capsules and the vest will inflate immediately.

1061
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,132
就是这样。
That's all there is to it.

1062
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:34,002
有我的电话吗?
Any calls for me?

1063
01:30:34,035 --> 01:30:35,503
随你挑吧。
Take your pick.

1064
01:30:36,187 --> 01:30:38,556
博伊德,公共关系。
Boyd, public relations.

1065
01:30:38,589 --> 01:30:41,592
不,汤米,不。我们没有失去一架飞机。
No, Tommy, no. We've not lost an airplane.

1066
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:45,095
看，我就站在这里执行任务我们的飞机还在空中。
Look, I'm standing right here in operations and our plane is still in the air.

1067
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:46,564
是啊，我们遇到了点小麻烦。
Yeah, we had a little trouble.

1068
01:30:46,597 --> 01:30:48,499
不，我不知道乘客的名字。
No, I don't know the passengers' names.

1069
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:50,768
是的,是的,好的。
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1070
01:30:50,801 --> 01:30:52,102
加菲尔德在哪儿?
Where's Garfield?

1071
01:30:52,136 --> 01:30:54,414
这家混蛋报社想要运营经理发表声明。
This jerk newspaper wants a statement from the operations manager.

1072
01:30:54,438 --> 01:30:56,707
他已经在路上了。他随时都会到。
He's on his way. He'll be here any minute.

1073
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:59,076
博伊德,公共关系。
Boyd, public relations.

1074
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:04,915
听着，奥斯瓦尔德，这家航空公司已经飞行了三千多万英里乘客都毫发无损。
Listen, Oswald, this airline has flown over 30 million passenger miles without ever scratching a passenger.

1075
01:31:04,948 --> 01:31:06,817
我们当然要合作!
Sure we want to cooperate!

1076
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:10,154
你现在就能知道真相，给我点时间整理一下。
You'll get the straight dope right from here, just give me time to get organized.

1077
01:31:10,188 --> 01:31:11,922
再见。
Goodbye.

1078
01:31:11,955 --> 01:31:13,857
加菲尔德先生，能给我点时间吗?
Oh, Mr. Garfield, can you give me a minute?

1079
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:15,759
差不多。你的麻烦是什么?
Just about. What's your trouble?

1080
01:31:15,793 --> 01:31:18,662
这些文件已经在我脖子上了。我该怎么跟他们说?
The papers are on my neck already. What will I tell 'em?

1081
01:31:18,696 --> 01:31:20,864
以"去死吧"开场怎么样?
How about, "Drop dead," for an opener?

1082
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,566
你知道我不能那么做。
You know I can't do that.

1083
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,801
我知道。
I know.

1084
01:31:23,834 --> 01:31:25,269
你能拖住他们多久?
How long can you stall 'em?

1085
01:31:25,303 --> 01:31:28,406
我不知道，大概一个小时吧。他们哭着要早报。
I don't know, maybe an hour. They're crying about morning editions.

1086
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:31,509
一个小时就够了。我们有大麻烦了。
An hour might be enough. We've got real trouble.

1087
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:33,143
哦，看起来有那么糟吗?
Oh, does it look that bad?

1088
01:31:34,878 --> 01:31:36,580
看起来不太好。
It don't look good.

1089
01:31:44,255 --> 01:31:46,056
你们俩还好吗?
Is everything all right with you two?

1090
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:50,328
我不知道这五年来我什么时候感觉好些了。
I don't know when I've felt better in the last five years.

1091
01:31:50,361 --> 01:31:55,233
我刚刚把陈小姐选为我最想和她一起登上救生筏的女孩。
I've just elected Miss Chen as the girl I would most like to be on a life raft with.

1092
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:58,101
当然，现在她可能更喜欢年轻一点的男人。
Of course, now, she may prefer a younger man.

1093
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:03,241
我家有句非常非常古老的谚语。
There is in my family a very, very old saying.

1094
01:32:11,215 --> 01:32:13,551
我会试着帮你翻译一下。
I will try to translate it for you.

1095
01:32:14,318 --> 01:32:22,493
嗯…"人的青春永远不会逝去" "除非他杀了它"
Um... "The youth of man will never die "unless he murders it."

1096
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:25,162
我不服罪。
I plead not guilty.

1097
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:28,932
我只是想教你怎么用救生衣。
I just want to show you how to use your life vest.

1098
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:35,873
我的脖子承受不了任何重量，我的骨头只能靠想象来连接。
My neck won't stand any weight and my bones are only held together by my imagination.

1099
01:32:35,906 --> 01:32:39,310
海葬会为我的继承人节省一大笔钱。
A burial at sea will save my heirs a lot of money.

1100
01:32:39,343 --> 01:32:41,812
你那样说话，我真为你感到羞耻。
I'm ashamed of you for talking like that.

1101
01:32:41,845 --> 01:32:43,213
为什么这样做呢?
Why do that?

1102
01:32:43,247 --> 01:32:46,550
布里斯克先生，你这样看起来更舒服。
You just look more comfortable that way, Mr. Briscoe.

1103
01:32:46,584 --> 01:32:50,521
反正你给我的印象是开领型的。
You impress me as the open-collar type anyway.

1104
01:32:50,554 --> 01:32:52,022
崎岖的,你知道的。
Rugged, you know.

1105
01:32:52,055 --> 01:32:54,392
户外的,你的意思是?是的。
Outdoorsy, you mean? Yes.

1106
01:32:54,425 --> 01:32:55,993
现在，你要规矩点。
Now, you behave yourself.

1107
01:32:56,026 --> 01:32:59,162
我马上回来看看你是否对陈小姐好。
I'll be coming back to make sure you're being nice to Miss Chen.

1108
01:32:59,196 --> 01:33:04,835
对一个没有马的户外工作者来说这是一项艰巨的任务，但我会尽力的。
Well, it's a rough assignment for an outdoor man without his horse, but I'll do my best.

1109
01:33:06,069 --> 01:33:09,039
你们现在要穿上背心吗?
Would you like to put your vests on now?

1110
01:33:09,072 --> 01:33:13,911
调查无疑会证明这架飞机已经准备好被扔进垃圾堆了。
Investigation will undoubtedly prove this airplane was ready for the junk heap.

1111
01:33:13,944 --> 01:33:16,079
而我们却被一群无能之辈所控制!
And we're in the hands of incompetents!

1112
01:33:16,113 --> 01:33:20,250
我不想惹麻烦，但你为什么不闭嘴?
I don't want to make no trouble, but why don't you shut up?

1113
01:33:20,284 --> 01:33:22,085
你恨我，不是吗?
You hate me, don't you?

1114
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:24,588
你们都恨我，因为我想做正确的事。
All of you hate me because I tried to do what was right.

1115
01:33:24,622 --> 01:33:26,924
照那位小姐说的做!
Do like the little lady says!

1116
01:33:26,957 --> 01:33:28,992
请不要碰我!
Don't touch me, please!

1117
01:33:29,026 --> 01:33:32,730
你让我很难堪，阿格纽先生。我只是想帮你。
You're giving me a very bad time, Mr. Agnew. I'm only trying to help you.

1118
01:33:32,763 --> 01:33:37,535
我有一个完美的权利…在未来的一段时间里，你根本没有任何权利!
I have a perfect right... You got no rights at all for some time to come!

1119
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:46,444
照她说的做，否则救生衣就救不了你了因为我会把你的头埋在水里直到你不再摇摆!
Do like she says or no life vest is gonna keep you from drowning because I'm gonna hold your head under till you stop wigglin'!

1120
01:33:49,847 --> 01:33:53,183
现在，如果我们碰巧下去了，我会给你很多警告。
Now, if we should happen to go down, I'll give you plenty of warning.

1121
01:33:53,216 --> 01:33:56,754
像这样把你的胳膊交叉在你的面前。
Cross your arms like this right in front of your face.

1122
01:33:56,787 --> 01:33:59,657
把你的手放在前面的座位上。
Brace your hands on the seat just ahead.

1123
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:05,363
把你的头弯下来夹在两臂之间，直到我们完全停止。
Bend your head down between your arms and keep them there until we've stopped completely.

1124
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,431
记得脱掉你的鞋子。
Remember to remove your shoes.

1125
01:34:07,465 --> 01:34:09,633
对了，你们男人应该松开衣领和领带。
Oh, and you men should loosen your collar and tie.

1126
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:11,502
为什么?
Why?

1127
01:34:11,535 --> 01:34:16,139
根据弃船指令，这样就不会摔断脖子。
According to the ditching instructions, there is less possibility of breaking your neck.

1128
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:29,853
从420年吗?
Anything from 420?

1129
01:34:29,887 --> 01:34:31,288
他们一点声音都没有，长官。
Not a sound out of them, sir.

1130
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:41,565
那些人，如果他们今晚就得弃船，海风在海面上翻腾，我想他们生还的机会不大。
Those people, if they have to ditch tonight, with the way that wind's kickin' up that sea, they don't stand much of a chance, I'm thinkin'.

1131
01:35:54,905 --> 01:35:56,940
来自旧金山的Cristobal Trader。
Cristobal Trader from San Francisco.

1132
01:35:56,974 --> 01:35:58,776
我们现在可以清楚地操纵飞机了。
We can work the aircraft clearly now.

1133
01:35:58,809 --> 01:36:00,377
谢谢你的帮助。结束了。
Thanks for your help. Over.

1134
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:02,813
好。很多谢谢。
Good. Muchas gracias.

1135
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:06,817
克里斯托巴尔交易员完毕。
Cristobal Trader over and out.

1136
01:36:37,715 --> 01:36:39,358
让我接手一段时间怎么样?
How about letting me take over for a while?

1137
01:36:39,382 --> 01:36:41,719
把自己留到以后。我们需要你。
Save yourself for later. We'll need you.

1138
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:43,220
好吧。
All right.

1139
01:36:50,528 --> 01:36:53,531
船长，水箱快干了。
Hey, Skipper, it will be almost dry tanks.

1140
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,999
可能还剩下20到30加仑。
Maybe 20 or 30 gallons left.

1141
01:36:56,033 --> 01:36:57,935
但如果风向正确，我们就能到达。
But if the winds are right we can make it.

1142
01:36:57,968 --> 01:37:01,138
我们在过去的一小时里有四分钟。我都想明白了。
We picked up four minutes in the past hour. I figured it all out.

1143
01:37:01,171 --> 01:37:04,107
如果我们能坚持11分钟，我们就安全了。
If we can pick up a total of 11 minutes, we're safe.

1144
01:37:04,141 --> 01:37:06,343
船长，拦截器在呼叫我们。
Hey, Skipper, the interceptor is calling us.

1145
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:12,945
我们估计我们的位置在你们以东145英里。
We estimate our position at 145 miles east of you.

1146
01:37:12,979 --> 01:37:15,648
预计20分钟后拦截。
Expect interception in approximately 20 minutes.

1147
01:37:16,283 --> 01:37:17,584
确定他的方位!
Get a bearing on him!

1148
01:37:21,588 --> 01:37:24,357
从现在开始，我们每三分钟发送一次。
We will transmit every three minutes from now on.

1149
01:37:24,391 --> 01:37:28,395
当你的指针开始迅速波动时，立即通知我们。
When your needle begins to fluctuate rapidly, advise us immediately.

1150
01:37:28,428 --> 01:37:30,063
这样我们就会离你很近。
We will then be very close to you.

1151
01:37:31,531 --> 01:37:33,566
你现在应该有点风度了。它怎么样?
You should have a bearing by now. How about it?

1152
01:37:40,607 --> 01:37:41,674
我们会成功的!
We're gonna make it!

1153
01:37:44,177 --> 01:37:46,746
向北5度。
Five degrees north of our course.

1154
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:48,448
知道你在这里，我们非常高兴。
We're awful glad to know you're around.

1155
01:37:48,481 --> 01:37:50,850
我们知道你的意思。
We know what you mean.

1156
01:37:50,883 --> 01:37:52,719
你们能再爬高一点吗?
Say, can you guys climb any higher?

1157
01:37:52,752 --> 01:37:55,088
有了这些东西，拦截就容易多了。
Out of this stuff interception would be a lot easier.

1158
01:37:55,122 --> 01:37:58,791
负的。我们可以爬升，但我们不想使用燃料。
Negative. We can climb, but we don't want to use the fuel to do it.

1159
01:37:58,825 --> 01:38:00,927
每加一加仑，离海岸就近一英里。
Every gallon's a mile nearer shore for us.

1160
01:38:02,028 --> 01:38:03,896
好吧。我们会找到你的。
Okay. We'll find you anyway.

1161
01:38:27,387 --> 01:38:29,021
你还害怕吗?
Are you still afraid?

1162
01:38:29,055 --> 01:38:32,925
不，亲爱的，不。
No, my darling, no.

1163
01:38:32,959 --> 01:38:38,064
我不是指飞机。我是说我们，我们的未来。
I don't mean the airplane. I mean us, our future.

1164
01:38:38,097 --> 01:38:39,966
我现在什么都不怕了。
I'm not afraid of anything now.

1165
01:38:41,134 --> 01:38:42,469
我听不见。
I can't hear you.

1166
01:38:44,404 --> 01:38:47,874
你这样抱着我，我怎么能害怕呢?
How could I ever be afraid when you hold me like this?

1167
01:38:48,975 --> 01:38:50,410
我爱你。
I love you.

1168
01:39:05,925 --> 01:39:07,294
不。
No.

1169
01:39:09,896 --> 01:39:12,098
想想我们在哪里。
Just think where we are.

1170
01:39:12,131 --> 01:39:16,536
我在想如果这是我最后一次这样抱着你那该有多糟糕。
I'm thinking how awful it would be if this was the last time I could hold you so.

1171
01:39:18,571 --> 01:39:21,040
我们会有好几年，一辈子。
We'll have years, all our lives.

1172
01:39:21,073 --> 01:39:22,975
如果这架飞机成功了。
If this airplane makes it.

1173
01:39:24,344 --> 01:39:27,180
小心,亲爱的。
Careful, darling.

1174
01:39:35,922 --> 01:39:37,257
霍华德。
Howard.

1175
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:41,828
霍华德。
Howard.

1176
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,936
我以为你不跟我说话了。
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

1177
01:39:51,838 --> 01:39:53,706
如果我淹死了，你会难过吗?
Would you be sorry if I drowned?

1178
01:39:55,242 --> 01:39:57,143
别荒谬。
Don't be ridiculous.

1179
01:39:57,176 --> 01:39:58,711
我必须知道。
I have to know.

1180
01:40:00,713 --> 01:40:02,349
我会非常抱歉的。
I'd be more than sorry.

1181
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:06,686
你可以去你的北方森林。
You could go off to your north woods.

1182
01:40:09,656 --> 01:40:14,461
我突然想到，想要在那座矿山取得成功可能只是一场噩梦。
It's occurred to me that trying to make a go at that mine might turn out to be a bad dream.

1183
01:40:15,595 --> 01:40:18,765
但这是梦想，霍华德，你的梦想。
But it is a dream, Howard, your dream.

1184
01:40:19,932 --> 01:40:21,133
这是。
It was.

1185
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:26,473
我可以把东西换回来。我想那会让你高兴的。
I could switch things back. I suppose that would please you.

1186
01:40:27,374 --> 01:40:28,841
我只能失去你。
I'd only lose you.

1187
01:40:31,244 --> 01:40:33,880
几小时前，你还坚持要赶我走。
A few hours ago, you insisted on getting rid of me.

1188
01:40:39,419 --> 01:40:42,789
有时我是一个非常愚蠢和自私的女人。
At times I'm a very stupid and selfish woman.

1189
01:40:45,825 --> 01:40:48,094
我觉得你应该去你的矿井。
I think you should go up to your mine.

1190
01:40:48,928 --> 01:40:50,330
这是你的。
That's you.

1191
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:54,066
你可以带我一起去找乐子。
And you might take me along for laughs.

1192
01:40:55,668 --> 01:40:57,670
我听到的东西。
I'm hearing things.

1193
01:40:57,704 --> 01:40:59,806
你会痛苦。
You'd be miserable.

1194
01:41:00,773 --> 01:41:02,041
毫无疑问。
No doubt.

1195
01:41:03,242 --> 01:41:05,478
但我需要你。
But I want you.

1196
01:41:05,512 --> 01:41:07,514
我有足够的理智去嫁给他。
The guy I had sense enough to marry.

1197
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:20,274
如果我被热蛋糕噎住了，或者试图给当地人穿上晚礼服，或者和雪橇狗一起喝鸡尾酒，你就得对我耐心点。
If I choke on hotcakes, or try to put evening gowns on the natives, Or have cocktails with the sled dogs, you'll just have to be patient with me.

1198
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:24,745
你不必这么做，但我希望你这么做。
You don't have to, but I wish you would.

1199
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:29,883
走!
Mush!

1200
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,186
这是你对雪橇狗说的话，不是吗?
That's what you say to a sled dog, isn't it?

1201
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:33,954
我想开始练习。
I want to start practicing.

1202
01:41:35,856 --> 01:41:38,092
Eeyah !
Eeyah!

1203
01:41:38,126 --> 01:41:40,794
如果你喊得够大声，就能让他们左转。
Makes them turn left, if you yell it loud enough.

1204
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:42,463
Eeyah !
Eeyah!

1205
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:45,866
你很好。
You're very good.

1206
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:52,240
你能接通沙利文吗?
Can you get that through to Sullivan?

1207
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:53,841
我可以试一试。
I can try.

1208
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:55,843
其他的都搞定了吗?是的,先生。
Everything else buttoned up? Yes, sir.

1209
01:41:59,347 --> 01:42:01,382
当地的天气有好转吗?
Any improvement in the local weather?

1210
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:02,750
恐怕不是。
I'm afraid not.

1211
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:22,370
雷达、任何东西了吗?
Radar, anything yet?

1212
01:42:22,403 --> 01:42:24,172
没有目标,先生。
No target, sir.

1213
01:42:24,205 --> 01:42:26,240
导航员，我们的拦截位置如何?
Navigator, how's our position for interception?

1214
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,643
死。刚找到罗兰。
Dead on. Just got a Loran fix.

1215
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:33,820
如果他们的导航仪接近正确位置，我们现在就可以加入了。
We should be joining now, if their navigator is anywhere near right.

1216
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:46,594
雷达?
Radar?

1217
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:47,628
没有目标,先生。
No target, sir.

1218
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:49,830
别人是错的。
Somebody's wrong.

1219
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:51,183
我们应该就在他们前面。
We should be right on top of them.

1220
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:56,003
我们很容易忽略这个人。
We can easily miss this guy.

1221
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,540
没有目标,先生。
No target, sir.

1222
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,811
导航器的古怪。
That navigator's wacky.

1223
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:05,913
我们已经迟到七分钟了。
We're already seven minutes overdue.

1224
01:43:07,315 --> 01:43:09,417
雷达?
Radar?

1225
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:11,685
目标,队长。强大的波动。
Target, Skipper. Strong blip.

1226
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:13,621
左转4度，8英里。
Four degrees left, eight miles.

1227
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:15,289
看起来他在我们下面500英尺。
Looks like he's 500 feet below us.

1228
01:43:32,105 --> 01:43:34,742
你犯了个错误，是吧，胖子?
Made a mistake, didn't you, fatso?

1229
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:38,178
你指望的11分钟是怎么回事?
What happened to the 11 minutes you were counting on?

1230
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,914
他们怎么了，胖子?
What happened to them, fatso?

1231
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:43,751
你永远无法弥补，你只是觉得你可以。
You never could make them up, you just thought you could.

1232
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:46,687
伦尼，怎么了?
Lennie, what about it?

1233
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,522
等一下,队长。我还检查。
Hang on, Skipper. I'm still checking.

1234
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:03,371
时间的浪费,胖子。停止颤抖。
Time's wasting, fatso. Stop shaking.

1235
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:06,707
找到时间，你就可以回到我身边。
Find the minutes, and you can come back to me.

1236
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:09,277
分钟。分钟。
Minutes. Minutes.

1237
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,012
谁有时间?
Who's got the minutes?

1238
01:44:12,045 --> 01:44:14,615
你的苏西就在这儿。
Your Susie's got them, right here.

1239
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:19,620
来吧,伦尼。是什么阻碍了事情的发展?
Come on, Lennie. What's holding things up?

1240
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:21,333
海岸警卫队说你的位置不对。
The Coast Guard says your position's wrong.

1241
01:44:22,045 --> 01:44:23,713
我马上就来，船长。
I'll be right with you, Skipper.

1242
01:44:29,052 --> 01:44:30,087
哦。
Oh.

1243
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:34,624
队长吗?
Skipper?

1244
01:44:36,393 --> 01:44:37,760
是吗?
Yeah?

1245
01:44:37,794 --> 01:44:39,329
我有个坏消息。
I got bad news.

1246
01:44:40,797 --> 01:44:42,332
海岸警卫队是对的。
The Coast Guard was right.

1247
01:44:42,365 --> 01:44:43,866
我犯了小孩子的错误。
I made a dumb kid's mistake.

1248
01:44:45,135 --> 01:44:48,571
我们没有我想的那么靠近海岸。
We're not as close to the coast as I thought we were.

1249
01:44:48,605 --> 01:44:50,907
我算的是打结，而不是英里。
I was figuring in knots instead of miles.

1250
01:44:52,075 --> 01:44:54,577
我想，我只是害怕。
I guess, I was just scared.

1251
01:44:54,611 --> 01:44:56,779
那11分钟呢?
What about those 11 minutes?

1252
01:44:56,813 --> 01:44:59,349
它们可以让水和你自己的床变得不同。
They can make the difference between the water and your own bed.

1253
01:44:59,382 --> 01:45:01,050
他们没有。
They aren't there.

1254
01:45:02,085 --> 01:45:03,653
他们从未去过那里。
They never were there.

1255
01:45:05,054 --> 01:45:06,789
对不起,队长。
I'm sorry, Skipper.

1256
01:45:08,057 --> 01:45:09,692
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1257
01:45:20,069 --> 01:45:21,804
我希望它能浮起来。
I hope this will float.

1258
01:45:46,129 --> 01:45:49,232
你的到来让我很兴奋，莎莉。
I am so excited about your arrival, Sally.

1259
01:45:49,266 --> 01:45:57,307
明天，我将离开这些高山和松树，这也是你们的家，我将去城市，这是我一年多来的第一次访问。
Tomorrow, I'll leave these mountains and pines, which will be your home, too and go down to the city for my first visit in over a year.

1260
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:04,247
我想在你到达前几天到达那里因为这个小屋需要一些东西来让女孩更舒适。
I want to get there a few days before you arrive because there are some things this cabin needs to make it more comfortable for a girl.

1261
01:46:07,617 --> 01:46:09,786
我还是怕你不喜欢这里。
I'm still scared you won't like it up here.

1262
01:46:19,996 --> 01:46:27,437
除非你对山间溪流的声音着迷，或者喜欢看太阳把山峰转得很慢。
Unless you're nuts about the sound of a mountain stream or love to watch the sun seem to turn a mountain peak around very slow.

1263
01:46:32,642 --> 01:46:33,676
嘿,亨利。
Hey, Henry.

1264
01:46:39,216 --> 01:46:41,684
我们的一个邻居只是过来打个招呼。
One of our neighbors just came by to say hello.

1265
01:46:41,718 --> 01:46:43,886
我叫他亨利的小鹿。
A little fawn I call Henry.

1266
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,390
他好像在问:“萨莉在哪儿?”你的妻子呢?”
He seems to ask, "Where is Sally? Where is your wife?"

1267
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:49,125
所以快点，姑娘，快点!
So hurry, girl, hurry!

1268
01:46:51,794 --> 01:46:55,865
所以你们一定会在机场认出我的，我会系一条亮绿色的领带。
So you'll be sure to recognize me at the airport, I'll be wearing a bright green tie.

1269
01:46:55,898 --> 01:46:57,634
注:
P.S.

1270
01:46:57,667 --> 01:47:00,237
我只是在想我有多幸运。
I was just thinking how lucky I am.

1271
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:06,376
我碰巧捡到一本撕破的旧杂志，上面有你的照片，正中我的下怀。
I happened to pick up an old torn magazine and there is your picture, smacking me right between the eyes.

1272
01:47:06,409 --> 01:47:12,282
过不了多久，那个长得非常漂亮的小女孩就要和我一起生活了。
And only a short time later, that very wonderful-looking little girl is coming to share my life.

1273
01:47:36,806 --> 01:47:38,174
显著。
Remarkable.

1274
01:47:39,809 --> 01:47:42,111
有什么了不起的?
What's so remarkable?

1275
01:47:42,144 --> 01:47:47,717
是信仰还是习惯迫使一个女人在登上救生筏前化妆?
Is it faith or just habit that compels a woman to put on fresh makeup before boarding a life raft?

1276
01:47:49,018 --> 01:47:51,388
你是不是太操之过急了?
Aren't you jumping the gun?

1277
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:53,890
你这是在听天由命吗?
You're being a fatalist about this business, then?

1278
01:47:57,193 --> 01:47:59,596
我都不知道宿命论者是什么。
I'm not sure I even know what a fatalist is.

1279
01:48:00,597 --> 01:48:05,268
刚才你还吓坏了，你怎么能这么平静地坐在那儿呢?
How can you sit there so calmly then, when a little while ago you were terrified?

1280
01:48:06,336 --> 01:48:09,839
我跟你坐在一起是因为我觉得我或许能帮到你。
I sat down here with you because I thought I might be able to help you.

1281
01:48:10,773 --> 01:48:12,509
但没人需要我。
But I'm not needed.

1282
01:48:14,711 --> 01:48:18,715
如果你是来帮助我的，部分原因是你自己也需要帮助，
If you came over to give me help, it was partly because you needed help yourself,

1283
01:48:21,451 --> 01:48:22,819
很差。
very badly.

1284
01:48:25,722 --> 01:48:27,724
别为我担心。
Don't worry about me.

1285
01:48:27,757 --> 01:48:31,894
我不再担心会失去那些我从一开始就没有机会得到的东西。
I've just stopped worrying about losing something I never had a chance to get in the first place.

1286
01:48:32,621 --> 01:48:34,523
会是男人吗?
Would the thing be a man?

1287
01:48:34,557 --> 01:48:36,092
还是我说得太私人了?
Or am I getting too personal?

1288
01:48:36,959 --> 01:48:38,361
你。
You are.

1289
01:48:38,394 --> 01:48:39,795
我不在乎了。
I don't care anymore.

1290
01:48:41,164 --> 01:48:43,166
我骗自己的时间够长了。
I've been kidding myself long enough.

1291
01:48:45,601 --> 01:48:47,370
我不会再逃跑了。
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

1292
01:48:49,238 --> 01:48:50,706
你在逃避什么?
What are you hiding from?

1293
01:48:53,842 --> 01:48:55,244
我自己。
Myself.

1294
01:48:57,513 --> 01:49:00,749
他是一个善良，干净，优秀的人。
He's a kind, clean, wonderful man.

1295
01:49:02,085 --> 01:49:04,420
他有权知道我是什么样的人。
He has a right to know what kind of a person I am.

1296
01:49:06,622 --> 01:49:08,557
我要去告诉他。
I'm going to tell him.

1297
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:12,328
我要告诉他我不是他想象中的那种人。
I'm going to tell him that I'm a different kind of person than he thinks I am.

1298
01:49:15,731 --> 01:49:21,637
我不完美，不善良，也不干净。
I'm not wonderful, not kind, I'm not clean.

1299
01:49:26,342 --> 01:49:31,547
告诉你这些很容易，因为你是个陌生人，我再也见不到你了。
Telling you these things is easy, because you're a stranger and I'll never see you again.

1300
01:49:34,283 --> 01:49:40,089
告诉他是……这将是我这辈子做过的最艰难的事情之一
Telling him is... It's going to be one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life

1301
01:49:42,691 --> 01:49:43,926
因为在我心里
because in my heart

1302
01:49:46,462 --> 01:49:47,996
我会一直看到他。
I'll always see him.

1303
01:49:49,832 --> 01:49:52,135
甚至当他转身走开的时候。
And even when he turns his back and walks away.

1304
01:50:01,043 --> 01:50:02,645
看我的脸。
Look at my face.

1305
01:50:04,313 --> 01:50:05,881
你不会走开吗?
Wouldn't you walk away?

1306
01:50:08,884 --> 01:50:11,287
我比我的实际年龄老了很多。
I'm so much older than my years have made me.

1307
01:50:13,222 --> 01:50:15,524
仔细看着我的脸，就像他会做的那样。
Look at my face carefully, as he'll do.

1308
01:50:16,425 --> 01:50:18,594
你会看到我有多老。
You'll see how very old I am.

1309
01:50:21,597 --> 01:50:22,898
我击败。
I'm beat.

1310
01:50:24,867 --> 01:50:27,136
我会成为一个漂亮的新娘。
I'll make a swell-looking bride.

1311
01:50:28,704 --> 01:50:30,173
一拍新娘。
A beat bride.

1312
01:50:33,909 --> 01:50:35,911
但我不再害怕了。
But I'm not afraid anymore.

1313
01:50:38,747 --> 01:50:41,650
现在我知道要发生什么了，我几乎高兴了。
Now that I know what's going to happen, I'm almost happy.

1314
01:50:46,655 --> 01:50:49,325
几分钟前我还没化妆呢。
So, I wasn't making up my face a few minutes ago.

1315
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,597
我看着镜子里的自己。
I was looking in the mirror, at me.

1316
01:50:57,666 --> 01:50:59,668
这回答了你的问题吗，先生?
Does that answer your question, mister?

1317
01:51:03,038 --> 01:51:04,573
我是错误的。
I was mistaken.

1318
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:07,505
你不是宿命论者。
You aren't a fatalist.

1319
01:51:07,539 --> 01:51:09,541
你是个勇敢的姑娘。
You're a very courageous young lady.

1320
01:51:11,609 --> 01:51:14,546
如果我继续坐在这里，也许有些东西会对我不起作用。
Maybe some of it will brush off on me if I keep sitting here.

1321
01:51:16,114 --> 01:51:18,850
也许我可以在自己的生活中抛弃一些东西。
Maybe I can throw a few things out of my own life.

1322
01:51:41,239 --> 01:51:43,908
香烟吗?不,谢谢。我不用这些东西。
Cigarette? No, thanks. I don't use them things.

1323
01:51:51,749 --> 01:51:54,686
你一定要这么做吗?是的。
Do you have to do that? Yeah.

1324
01:52:00,092 --> 01:52:02,460
我现在可以拿回我的财产了吗?
Could I have my property back now?

1325
01:52:02,494 --> 01:52:04,229
为什么?
Why?

1326
01:52:04,262 --> 01:52:06,931
这对我来说意义重大。
Well, it would mean a great deal to me.

1327
01:52:06,964 --> 01:52:10,435
消除这种一直被监视的感觉。
Take away this feeling of being constantly watched.

1328
01:52:11,803 --> 01:52:13,705
我现在好了。很平静。
I'm all right, now. Quite calm.

1329
01:52:13,738 --> 01:52:14,906
你可以相信我。
You can trust me.

1330
01:52:26,118 --> 01:52:27,885
坐下来。
Sit down.

1331
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:34,092
你有很多事情要考虑，也许没有那么多时间去做。
You got lots to think about, and maybe not so much time for to do it.

1332
01:52:55,313 --> 01:53:03,755
圣母玛利亚，天主之母，请为我们现在以及我们临终时的罪人祈祷。阿们。
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1333
01:53:03,788 --> 01:53:06,724
我们在天上的父愿人都尊你的名为圣。
Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.

1334
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:08,726
你的天国……
Thy kingdom come...

1335
01:53:13,531 --> 01:53:15,167
斯帕克斯，按喇叭。
Sparks, get on the horn.

1336
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:17,769
建议拦截完成于56。
Advised interception completed at 56.

1337
01:53:24,576 --> 01:53:26,344
好吧,丹。我将接管。
Okay, Dan. I'll take over.

1338
01:53:42,093 --> 01:53:43,328
现在回去。
Go back now.

1339
01:53:43,361 --> 01:53:45,497
带上那个叫吉布森的女孩，把乘客都安排好。
Take the Gibson girl, get the passengers all set.

1340
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:47,632
你有的是时间。
You'll have plenty of time.

1341
01:53:47,665 --> 01:53:51,169
在我们下水前10分钟打开安全带指示灯。
Turn on the seat belt sign 10 minutes before we start for the water.

1342
01:54:00,312 --> 01:54:01,413
好吧,
Well,

1343
01:54:03,481 --> 01:54:04,882
祝你们好运。
good luck, you guys.

1344
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,788
有什么风声吗，伦尼?
Anything new with the wind, Lennie?

1345
01:54:10,822 --> 01:54:13,591
不。我们不是很胖，是吗?
No. We're not very fat, then?

1346
01:54:13,625 --> 01:54:16,561
如果我们只有11分钟的燃料。
If we only had 11 minutes more of fuel.

1347
01:54:16,594 --> 01:54:19,163
11分钟吗?这就是你需要的吗?
11 minutes? Is that all you need?

1348
01:54:19,197 --> 01:54:20,565
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

1349
01:54:20,598 --> 01:54:22,634
我知道我们现在在哪。
I know exactly where we are now.

1350
01:54:22,667 --> 01:54:24,802
再加11分钟的燃料就能撑过去了。
Eleven minutes more of fuel would see us through.

1351
01:54:24,836 --> 01:54:29,441
我们需要增加多少风速来安排这个小东西?
What increase in wind velocity would we need to arrange that little thing?

1352
01:54:29,474 --> 01:54:31,743
未来一小时20海里。
Twenty knots in the next hour.

1353
01:54:31,776 --> 01:54:34,812
这要求太多了。是的。
That's asking a lot. Yeah.

1354
01:54:34,846 --> 01:54:37,249
不可能发生，所以我没问。
It couldn't happen so I'm not asking.

1355
01:54:37,282 --> 01:54:41,386
但如果风在尾部转得更大一点，就有可能。
But if the wind swung around a little more in the tail, it could be.

1356
01:54:45,563 --> 01:54:48,333
我想他们会在我们太潮湿之前把我们接走的。
I guess they'll pick us up before we get too damp.

1357
01:54:48,366 --> 01:54:49,901
苏茜肯定会担心的。
Susie will sure be worried.

1358
01:54:50,568 --> 01:54:52,170
她会制定法律。
She'll lay down the law.

1359
01:54:52,204 --> 01:54:54,339
可能是坚持让我放弃坐飞机。
Probably insist I quit flying.

1360
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:57,242
你会吗?
Will you?

1361
01:55:00,712 --> 01:55:01,746
不。
No.

1362
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,623
好吧,一切都在这里。我只希望它能起作用。
Well, everything's here. I just hope it works.

1363
01:55:11,656 --> 01:55:12,890
它将。
It will.

1364
01:55:14,992 --> 01:55:17,562
你不是不想依赖它吗?
Wouldn't you rather not have to depend on it?

1365
01:55:17,595 --> 01:55:19,764
你什么意思?假设我们不逃命。
What do you mean? Suppose we didn't ditch.

1366
01:55:20,665 --> 01:55:22,667
你必须。
You've got to.

1367
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:27,038
伦尼说我们只需要再多飞11分钟就能着陆。
Lennie says all we need is 11 extra flying minutes to make land.

1368
01:55:27,071 --> 01:55:29,907
我知道。沙利文的船长。他说我们该走了。
I know. Sullivan's the captain. He says we ditch.

1369
01:55:32,177 --> 01:55:36,481
如果我试图说服他，你会认为我错了吗?
Would you think I was wrong if I tried to talk him out of it?

1370
01:55:36,514 --> 01:55:38,416
试试运气吧?
Maybe try a little luck?

1371
01:55:39,851 --> 01:55:41,085
运气吗?
Luck?

1372
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:43,388
这是过时的人思考。
That's has-been thinking.

1373
01:55:43,421 --> 01:55:45,990
想在旧金山上空耗尽燃料吗?
Wanna run out of fuel, right over San Francisco?

1374
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:48,993
摧毁几座桥或几栋公寓?
Wipe out a few bridges or apartment houses?

1375
01:55:49,026 --> 01:55:51,163
沙利文多次飞过这片海洋。
Sullivan's been over this ocean lots of times.

1376
01:55:51,196 --> 01:55:53,731
他很懂行。
He knows his business.

1377
01:55:53,765 --> 01:55:55,900
我见过这样的男人。
I've seen men act like this before.

1378
01:55:57,086 --> 01:56:03,526
有时因为这样或那样的事情，人们会暂时停止思考。
Sometimes because of one thing or another fellow stops thinking straight temporarily.

1379
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:12,635
我坐飞机很久了，霍比。
I've been flying a long time, Hobie.

1380
01:56:13,969 --> 01:56:15,071
是的。
Yeah.

1381
01:56:16,372 --> 01:56:18,307
只是，你不是船长。
Only, you're not the captain.

1382
01:56:18,341 --> 01:56:21,844
也许是因为你所谓的好运在南美消失了一次。
Maybe because your so-called luck ran out on you once down in South America.

1383
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:25,148
这可不是什么幸运手术。
And now this is no luck operation.

1384
01:56:28,451 --> 01:56:30,753
你最好回去戴头盔和护目镜。
You better go back to your helmet and goggles.

1385
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:37,126
也许吧。
Maybe.

1386
01:57:36,985 --> 01:57:42,825
给你，伦尼。颜色可能不适合你，但它足以满足你。
Here it is, Lennie. Color may not become you, but it'll suffice you.

1387
01:57:42,858 --> 01:57:44,693
谢谢,。
Thanks, for nothing.

1388
01:57:48,531 --> 01:57:52,535
大概11分钟，你确定吗?
About that 11 minutes, are you absolutely sure?

1389
01:57:52,968 --> 01:57:54,337
绝对的。
Absolutely.

1390
01:58:02,678 --> 01:58:05,648
伦尼说如果我们能抓紧11分钟，就能赶到。
Lennie says if we can pick up 11 minutes, we can make it.

1391
01:58:12,688 --> 01:58:14,323
他可能是对的。
He could be right.

1392
01:58:19,195 --> 01:58:20,796
下面会很艰难的。
It'll be rough down there.

1393
01:58:20,829 --> 01:58:22,631
如果我们做错了，我们就完蛋了。
If we hit wrong, we've had it.

1394
01:58:25,434 --> 01:58:29,472
也许我们应该少开点电，省下几滴油。
Maybe we ought to ease off a little on the power and save a few drops of fuel.

1395
01:58:32,441 --> 01:58:34,377
如果我试一下，有异议吗?
Any objections if I try it?

1396
01:58:40,048 --> 01:58:42,818
这是行不通的。她会拖住我的。
This won't work. She's going to stall on me.

1397
01:58:42,851 --> 01:58:44,520
那不是很好。我们会炸掉另一个引擎。
That's no good. We'll blow another engine.

1398
01:58:44,553 --> 01:58:46,822
有什么区别呢?如果我们逃跑，会把他们都炸死的。
What's the difference? We'll blow them all if we ditch.

1399
01:58:48,224 --> 01:58:49,892
把那些控件放回原位。
Put those controls back where they belong.

1400
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:52,895
把那些道具放回去。
Put those props back.

1401
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,330
没有做,队长。
Nothing doing, Skipper.

1402
01:58:54,363 --> 01:58:55,698
这是一个订单!
That's an order!

1403
01:58:57,366 --> 01:58:59,034
等一下,密友。你可以的。
Hang on, chum. You can do it.

1404
01:58:59,067 --> 01:59:00,869
现在飞吧，让我祈祷。
Now fly and let me pray.

1405
01:59:00,903 --> 01:59:02,743
我们的汽油快用完了，就在旧金山上空。
We'll run out of gas, right over San Francisco.

1406
01:59:02,771 --> 01:59:03,882
好吧，让我们试试这个方法。
Well, let's try out this way for a while.

1407
01:59:03,906 --> 01:59:05,808
不要急着去游泳!
Don't be so anxious to go for a swim!

1408
01:59:08,577 --> 01:59:09,912
她又开始颤抖了。
She's starting to shake again.

1409
01:59:09,945 --> 01:59:12,681
所以，让她摇吧!必要的话，让她往下爬几英尺。
So, let her shake! Let her mush down a few feet if you have to.

1410
01:59:12,715 --> 01:59:15,150
这样我们可以节省燃料。现在抓紧飞吧!
We're saving fuel this way. Now hang on and fly!

1411
01:59:23,426 --> 01:59:24,727
你给沙利文的妻子打电话了吗?
Did you call Sullivan's wife?

1412
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,962
是的，先生，她正在去机场的路上。
Uh, yes, sir. She's on her way to the airport now.

1413
01:59:26,995 --> 01:59:28,264
你没惊动她吗?
You didn't alarm her?

1414
01:59:28,297 --> 01:59:32,335
不。没有，我只是告诉她，她丈夫在路上，你想见她。
No. No, I just told her, her husband was on his way, and that you wanted to see her.

1415
01:59:32,368 --> 01:59:34,069
那她就知道出事了。
Then she knows something's happened.

1416
01:59:34,102 --> 01:59:36,705
哦,可能。但她的声音却很平静。
Oh, probably. But her voice was quite calm.

1417
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:39,575
其他的呢?
How about the others?

1418
01:59:39,608 --> 01:59:42,211
惠勒和另一个飞行员杜普利住在一起。
Uh, Wheeler lives with another pilot, Dupree.

1419
01:59:42,245 --> 01:59:43,779
没有回答。
And there was no answer.

1420
01:59:43,812 --> 01:59:45,848
Wilby也是一样。
The same for Wilby.

1421
01:59:45,881 --> 01:59:50,619
我给他家打了电话，然后是我知道的一家酒吧。
I called his home and then a bar I know about.

1422
01:59:50,653 --> 01:59:55,391
他妻子去过那里，但她一小时前醉醺醺地离开了。
His wife had been there, but she left about an hour ago, drunk.

1423
01:59:57,526 --> 01:59:59,495
空中小姐吗?
The stewardess?

1424
01:59:59,528 --> 02:00:01,063
不，斯伯丁的妈妈不太好。
No, Spalding's mother isn't well.

1425
02:00:01,096 --> 02:00:03,165
她父亲出差去了。
And her father is out of town on business.

1426
02:00:04,633 --> 02:00:06,702
真希望我能把它们都说出来。
I wish I could tell them all together.

1427
02:00:06,735 --> 02:00:09,538
我想也许他们可以互相帮助。
I think maybe they could help each other.

1428
02:00:09,572 --> 02:00:12,408
上面没有丹·罗曼的名字。
Uh, there isn't anybody listed on there for Dan Roman.

1429
02:00:12,441 --> 02:00:14,410
你认识什么跟他亲近的人吗?
Do you know any person close to him?

1430
02:00:14,728 --> 02:00:16,363
是的。
Yeah.

1431
02:00:16,397 --> 02:00:17,898
但我觉得你联系不到她。
But I don't think you could reach her.

1432
02:00:18,832 --> 02:00:20,467
丹一个人住。
Dan lives alone.

1433
02:00:49,096 --> 02:00:51,332
一切都好吗?太好了，小子。
Is everything all right? Oh, just great, junior.

1434
02:00:55,001 --> 02:00:57,504
这是一件漂亮的衣服。
This is a stunning garment.

1435
02:00:57,538 --> 02:00:59,706
我觉得自己像道奇队的接球手。
I feel like a catcher for the Dodgers.

1436
02:01:01,475 --> 02:01:04,345
要我说，这是一件难看的裹尸布。
It's a frowsy-looking shroud, if you ask me.

1437
02:01:09,283 --> 02:01:11,017
哦,宝贝。
Oh, baby.

1438
02:01:13,754 --> 02:01:19,226
我经历了第一次世界大战和伦敦闪电战。
I went through the First World War and the Blitz in London.

1439
02:01:20,227 --> 02:01:22,729
我很害怕，但不是像这样。
I was scared, but not like this.

1440
02:01:27,734 --> 02:01:28,878
我想给你看点可爱的东西。
I want to show you something cute.

1441
02:01:28,902 --> 02:01:30,271
想看看可爱的东西吗?
Want to see something cute?

1442
02:01:32,839 --> 02:01:34,575
天啊，我一定是滑倒了。
Oh, boy, I must be slipping.

1443
02:01:34,608 --> 02:01:38,912
没有反应，即使是像你这样的人，也应该欣赏这种东西。
No reaction, even from a man like you, who should appreciate such things.

1444
02:01:42,683 --> 02:01:46,753
保持谈话。请。保持谈话。
Keep talking. Please. Keep talking.

1445
02:01:48,455 --> 02:01:50,056
我害怕。
I'm frightened.

1446
02:01:50,090 --> 02:01:53,827
说话。亲爱的，你不知道你在问什么。
Talking. Honey, you don't know what you're asking.

1447
02:01:53,860 --> 02:01:56,029
我要给你讲个好笑话。
I'll tell you a good joke on me.

1448
02:01:56,062 --> 02:02:03,537
你知道，我一直害怕成为一个老女人，从现在的情况来看，我再也不用担心了。
You know, I always dreaded the idea of becoming an old woman and from the way things look now, I won't have to worry about it anymore.

1449
02:02:05,972 --> 02:02:08,242
你知道吗，我已经很多年没被吹过哨了。
You know, I haven't been whistled at in years.

1450
02:02:08,275 --> 02:02:13,814
在我的余生中种植玫瑰的想法真的开始困扰我。
And the idea of growing roses for the rest of my life was really beginning to haunt me.

1451
02:02:15,682 --> 02:02:18,185
应该有个家给像我这样的女人。
There ought to be a home for dames like me.

1452
02:02:18,219 --> 02:02:20,687
是的。我们应该有组织的。
Yup. We should have organized.

1453
02:02:21,788 --> 02:02:26,159
一栋没有镜子的房子。
You know, a house somewhere with with no mirror in it.

1454
02:02:26,193 --> 02:02:29,396
去遥远的地方，在那里我们不用看到年轻的女孩。
Far away, where we'd never have to look at a young girl.

1455
02:02:30,564 --> 02:02:33,534
他们为未婚妈妈们提供住所。
They have homes for unmarried mothers.

1456
02:02:33,567 --> 02:02:40,140
但大家都忘记了那些女孩她们从来没能把事情合法化。
But everybody forgets about the girls who never quite managed to make things legal.

1457
02:02:42,843 --> 02:02:44,611
我想我可以开一个。
I think I could start one.

1458
02:02:45,246 --> 02:02:46,280
是的。
Yeah.

1459
02:02:46,313 --> 02:02:51,084
我可以叫它…五月霍尔斯特养老院。
I can call it the... The May Holst Home for Broken-Down Broads.

1460
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:55,556
我挺喜欢的，你呢?
I kind of like that, don't you?

1461
02:03:07,601 --> 02:03:10,070
好吧，他们现在已经准备好了。
Well, they're as ready now as they'll ever be.

1462
02:03:11,472 --> 02:03:14,241
听着，你能从容面对别的事吗?
Look, can you take something else in your stride?

1463
02:03:14,275 --> 02:03:16,209
我可以试一试。好。
I can try. Good.

1464
02:03:16,243 --> 02:03:18,078
我想让你帮我个忙。
I want you to do me a favor.

1465
02:03:21,181 --> 02:03:26,987
听着，我告诉你的时候，你就坐在那儿背靠着座位别动，不管发生什么事。
Look, when I tell you, sit down there with your back against that seat stay there, no matter what else is going on.

1466
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:31,958
不要试图成为一个英雄，因为在那最后的时刻你对任何人都没有任何帮助。
Don't try to be a heroine because in those last few moments there isn't anything in the world you can do to help anybody.

1467
02:03:31,992 --> 02:03:36,096
你知道吗，你的脸可以美化任何风景。
Now, you know, your face can improve any landscape.

1468
02:03:36,129 --> 02:03:37,564
我希望你能保持这种状态。
I want you to keep it that way.

1469
02:03:37,598 --> 02:03:39,232
所以我要帮你拿这个枕头。
So the favor for me is this pillow.

1470
02:03:39,266 --> 02:03:43,437
捂紧你的脸，为了你自己，也为了我。
Hold it tightly over your face, for yourself and for me.

1471
02:03:43,470 --> 02:03:47,574
在风和海的影响下上帝和沙利文都无法让这一切像鸡蛋箱一样平静下来。
With the wind and the sea neither God nor Sullivan can set this thing down tonight like an egg crate.

1472
02:03:47,608 --> 02:03:49,710
我们可能会撞上一座山。
We might just as well slam into a mountain.

1473
02:03:49,743 --> 02:03:52,178
丹知道它。我知道它。
Dan knows it. I know it.

1474
02:03:52,212 --> 02:03:53,414
沙利文也是。
And so does Sullivan.

1475
02:03:59,686 --> 02:04:01,588
威尔比，检查你的最后位置。
Wilby, check your final position.

1476
02:04:01,622 --> 02:04:06,327
我要扳倒她。再等几分钟……照我说的做。但看起来像…照我说的做。
I'm gonna take her down. Wait a few more minutes... Do as I say. But it looks like... Do as I say.

1477
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:08,170
再给他几分钟。我已经等了太久了。
Give him a few more minutes. I've already waited too long.

1478
02:04:08,194 --> 02:04:09,563
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

1479
02:04:09,596 --> 02:04:11,398
不,我们没有。
No, we don't.

1480
02:04:11,432 --> 02:04:13,767
控制住你自己，黄色的…
Get a hold of yourself, you yellow...

1481
02:04:21,842 --> 02:04:23,744
42.0正在失去高度，长官。
4-2-0 is losing altitude, sir.

1482
02:04:23,777 --> 02:04:25,879
42-0，海岸警卫队发来。
4-2-0, from Coast Guard.

1483
02:04:25,912 --> 02:04:27,614
雷达报告你在下降。
Radar reports you're descending.

1484
02:04:27,648 --> 02:04:29,249
你要逃学吗?
Are you going to ditch?

1485
02:04:32,152 --> 02:04:35,489
你现在低于接近海岸的最低合法高度。
You are now below the minimum legal altitude for approaching the coast.

1486
02:04:35,522 --> 02:04:36,590
时间的浪费。
Time's wasting.

1487
02:04:36,623 --> 02:04:38,359
你最好爬上去，要不就喝一杯。
You better climb or settle for the drink.

1488
02:04:38,392 --> 02:04:40,561
我们和你在一起。我们会跟着你下去。
We're right with you. We'll follow you down.

1489
02:04:40,594 --> 02:04:42,829
建议立即。
Advise immediately.

1490
02:04:42,863 --> 02:04:46,400
4-2-0呼叫海岸警卫队，4-2-0呼叫海岸警卫队。
4-2-0 to Coast Guard. 4-2-0 to Coast Guard.

1491
02:04:47,501 --> 02:04:50,771
我们太忙了，没时间回答。站在。
We've been too busy to answer. Stand by.

1492
02:04:50,804 --> 02:04:52,939
我们的计划可能会有变。
We may have a change in plans.

1493
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:06,687
-还剩三十分钟的燃料。槽的问题。
- Thirty minutes of fuel left. Cross-feed problem.

1494
02:05:07,521 --> 02:05:09,623
把规则手册扔掉。
Throw the rule book away.

1495
02:05:09,656 --> 02:05:14,867
最高障碍，1950英尺，所以2200英尺是安全的。
Highest obstruction, 1,950 feet, so 2,200 will be safe.

1496
02:05:17,593 --> 02:05:21,130
莱纳德，准备好电子高度计，读出读数。
Leonard, stand by electric altimeter, call out readings.

1497
02:05:21,164 --> 02:05:23,766
机头朝下，船飞得更快了。
Nose tipped down, ship fly faster.

1498
02:05:23,799 --> 02:05:26,001
更有效地利用燃料。
More efficient use of fuel against time.

1499
02:05:26,902 --> 02:05:28,971
研究方法的书。
Study approach book.

1500
02:05:29,004 --> 02:05:31,740
空中交通管制到清场区。
Air traffic control to clear area.

1501
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:34,077
测距台上的测向器。
Direction finders on range station.

1502
02:05:35,244 --> 02:05:37,113
现在开始。
Start right now.

1503
02:05:39,715 --> 02:05:40,749
丹?
Dan?

1504
02:05:41,584 --> 02:05:42,885
是吗?
Yeah?

1505
02:05:43,586 --> 02:05:45,854
谢谢。
Thanks.

1506
02:05:45,888 --> 02:05:47,856
谢谢你让我清醒过来。
Thanks for knocking some sense into my head.

1507
02:05:49,258 --> 02:05:50,793
有一天我会解释。
Someday I'll explain.

1508
02:05:50,826 --> 02:05:52,528
你不需要。
You don't have to.

1509
02:05:53,762 --> 02:05:55,698
我们不会逃跑的。
We're not going to ditch.

1510
02:05:55,731 --> 02:05:57,933
我们要让旧金山变得艰难。
We'll make San Francisco the hard way.

1511
02:05:59,001 --> 02:06:00,336
有什么变化吗，伦尼?
Any change in the wind, Lennie?

1512
02:06:00,369 --> 02:06:02,138
11分钟中有3分钟是我们拍的。
We picked up three of those 11 minutes.

1513
02:06:02,171 --> 02:06:04,273
把去旧金山的路线图给我。
Bring me the approach chart for San Francisco.

1514
02:06:09,378 --> 02:06:11,114
给我吹支曲子，丹。
Whistle me a tune, Dan.

1515
02:06:12,481 --> 02:06:14,517
我工作时喜欢听音乐。
I like music while I work.

1516
02:06:28,097 --> 02:06:29,865
要喝点什么吗，布里斯克先生?
Can I get you something, Mr. Briscoe?

1517
02:06:29,898 --> 02:06:32,000
是的。火腿三明治。
Yes. Uh, a ham sandwich.

1518
02:06:32,034 --> 02:06:34,403
我不能。一切都走得太远了。
I can't. Everything went overboard.

1519
02:06:34,437 --> 02:06:35,971
现在穿上那件背心。
Now you put on that vest.

1520
02:06:36,004 --> 02:06:40,376
伟大的服务。你把所有的食物都扔给鲨鱼，这样你就不用上菜了。
Great service. You throw all the food to the sharks, so you won't have to serve it.

1521
02:06:41,177 --> 02:06:43,646
告诉你什么。命题。
Tell you what. Proposition.

1522
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:49,318
我想陈小姐会让我在旧金山给她买牛排，如果你也来的话。
I think Miss Chen will let me buy her a steak in San Francisco, if you come along, too.

1523
02:06:49,352 --> 02:06:52,488
如果你接受，我就穿上背心。
If you'll accept, I'll put on the vest.

1524
02:06:52,521 --> 02:06:55,291
布里斯克先生，我们成交。
Mr. Briscoe, you have yourself a deal.

1525
02:07:03,266 --> 02:07:04,900
深呼吸，丹。
Take a breather, Dan.

1526
02:07:04,933 --> 02:07:06,335
好吧。
Okay.

1527
02:07:11,407 --> 02:07:13,409
法拉隆群岛，随时可能。
Farallon Islands, any minute now.

1528
02:07:16,223 --> 02:07:17,324
不要再低了。
Don't go any lower.

1529
02:07:17,357 --> 02:07:18,525
不。我会保持这个高度。
No. I'll hold this altitude.

1530
02:07:18,558 --> 02:07:21,261
伦尼，回来用无线电高度表报出我们的高度。
Lennie, get back and call out our altitude on the radio altimeter.

1531
02:07:21,294 --> 02:07:24,131
我们将直接向旧金山山脉的西北方向进发。
We'll make straight for the Northwest leg of San Francisco range.

1532
02:07:24,164 --> 02:07:27,200
那片区域已经清理完毕，我们几乎到了地面。
The area's been cleared and we're practically on the ground.

1533
02:07:27,234 --> 02:07:29,102
我喜欢你说话的方式。
I like the way you said that.

1534
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:42,215
还有28英里。
Twenty-eight miles to go.

1535
02:07:42,249 --> 02:07:44,417
他上了一垒。
Well, he's made first base.

1536
02:07:44,451 --> 02:07:50,657
但如果那家伙在从这里到机场的路上没油了，我不知道他会把车停在哪里除了在市场街中央。
But if that guy runs out of fuel between here and the airport, I don't know where he's gonna put that thing down except in the middle of Market Street.

1537
02:08:03,603 --> 02:08:04,937
把那东西关了。
Shut that thing off.

1538
02:08:09,242 --> 02:08:10,343
好吗?
Well?

1539
02:08:10,943 --> 02:08:12,045
好吗?
Well?

1540
02:08:14,581 --> 02:08:15,848
我要去候机厅。
I'm going over to the terminal.

1541
02:08:15,882 --> 02:08:17,750
如果需要，我会在控制塔台。
If needed, I'll be in the control tower.

1542
02:08:57,557 --> 02:09:00,260
好吧，就是这样。十分钟。
Well, this is it. Ten minutes.

1543
02:09:01,461 --> 02:09:03,029
来吧，我们最后再检查一下。
Come on, let's make a final check.

1544
02:09:09,936 --> 02:09:11,671
请把你的背心充气。我们会下来吗?
Inflate your vest, please. We're going down?

1545
02:09:11,704 --> 02:09:12,748
是的，但你会没事的。
Yeah, but you'll be all right.

1546
02:09:12,772 --> 02:09:14,507
回到门口的时候不要着急。
Just take your time coming back to the door.

1547
02:09:14,541 --> 02:09:16,109
等我喊出来再说。
Wait until I yell.

1548
02:09:16,143 --> 02:09:17,577
海岸警卫队的飞机还在吗?
Coast Guard plane still with us?

1549
02:09:17,610 --> 02:09:19,712
就在我们的机翼上。他会跟着我们的。
Right off our wing. He'll stick with us.

1550
02:09:19,746 --> 02:09:21,381
请把烟熄了。
Put out your cigarette, please.

1551
02:09:21,414 --> 02:09:22,715
把背心充气，查尔兹先生。
Inflate your vest, Mr. Childs.

1552
02:09:22,749 --> 02:09:24,351
你也是，霍尔斯特小姐。
You too, Miss Holst.

1553
02:09:26,453 --> 02:09:27,487
一些胸罩,嗯。
Some brassiere, huh.

1554
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:29,522
从现在起不要吸烟。祝你好运。
Don't smoke from now on. Good luck.

1555
02:09:30,655 --> 02:09:32,223
我真的应该带上我的公文包。
I really ought to take my briefcase.

1556
02:09:32,257 --> 02:09:35,093
对不起,不行。请把你的背心充气。
Sorry, nothing doing. Inflate your vest, please.

1557
02:09:39,864 --> 02:09:41,666
我不能。
I can't.

1558
02:09:41,699 --> 02:09:43,201
我吓坏了。
I'm terrified.

1559
02:09:44,235 --> 02:09:45,903
我好像动不了了。
I can't seem to move.

1560
02:09:51,476 --> 02:09:53,411
别担心。祝你好运。
Don't worry. Good luck.

1561
02:09:56,614 --> 02:09:57,748
都准备好了，你们俩?
All set, you two?

1562
02:09:57,782 --> 02:09:59,050
我们还饿。
We're still hungry.

1563
02:09:59,084 --> 02:10:01,852
我们的牛排约会推迟了。请把你的背心充气。
Our steak date is postponed. Inflate your vest, please.

1564
02:10:07,425 --> 02:10:09,227
也许你该留着这个。
Maybe you should keep this.

1565
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,938
我喜欢认为那是我的，即使只是几个小时。
I'd loved thinking it was mine, even if it was just for a few hours.

1566
02:10:11,962 --> 02:10:14,799
无稽之谈。你可以和我一样保持干燥。
Nonsense. You can keep it as dry as I can.

1567
02:10:14,832 --> 02:10:20,671
如果明晚七点还能用，就打车去蒙哥马利街的厄尼餐厅。
If it's still working tomorrow night at 7:00, take a cab to Ernie's Restaurant on Montgomery Street.

1568
02:10:20,705 --> 02:10:23,341
如果它不工作，无论如何来。
If it isn't working, come anyway.

1569
02:10:23,741 --> 02:10:25,476
谢谢。
Thanks.

1570
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:28,045
我们把他们都炸了，看到没?
We got them all to blow up, see?

1571
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:31,015
良好的工作。记住不要着急回到门口。
Good work. Remember take your time coming back to the door.

1572
02:10:31,682 --> 02:10:33,184
你想要什么?
You want?

1573
02:10:33,218 --> 02:10:35,553
不,谢谢。还是要谢谢你。
No, thanks. Thanks just the same.

1574
02:10:35,586 --> 02:10:39,424
如果我出了什么事，联系我在火奴鲁鲁的妻子。
If anything happens to me, get in touch with my wife in Honolulu.

1575
02:10:39,457 --> 02:10:42,093
告诉她我爱她。我是错误的。我爱她。
Tell her I loved her. I was mistaken. I love her.

1576
02:10:42,127 --> 02:10:43,870
你自己告诉她，先生。你会没事的。
You tell her yourself, mister. You'll be all right.

1577
02:10:43,894 --> 02:10:46,173
我不担心，我会是最后一个下飞机的人。
I'm not worrying and I'll be the last guy off this airplane.

1578
02:10:46,197 --> 02:10:47,498
你一定要这样吗?
Do you have to be?

1579
02:10:47,532 --> 02:10:48,733
这就是我的报酬。
That's what I get paid for.

1580
02:10:51,035 --> 02:10:53,638
安全带紧吗?我想是的。
Seat belt tight? I think so.

1581
02:10:54,439 --> 02:10:56,174
这是真的，不是吗?
This is for real, isn't it?

1582
02:10:56,207 --> 02:10:58,443
恐怕是这样的。请把你的背心充气。
I'm afraid so. Inflate your vest, please.

1583
02:11:03,648 --> 02:11:06,417
好吧，好吧，连我都可能浮起来。
Well, well, even I might float.

1584
02:11:09,254 --> 02:11:10,888
请把你的背心充气。
Inflate your vest, please.

1585
02:11:23,268 --> 02:11:27,838
我不想死。我不想死。
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

1586
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:31,008
艾德，别让我死。我的婴儿,艾德。
Ed, don't let me die. My babies, Ed.

1587
02:11:32,477 --> 02:11:33,911
有空的时候给她两个。
Give her two of these when you can.

1588
02:11:33,944 --> 02:11:35,180
他们会安静的她。
They'll quiet her.

1589
02:12:06,378 --> 02:12:07,645
随时待命。
Stand by for anything.

1590
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:09,547
沙利文要去旧金山了。
Sullivan is gonna try and make San Francisco.

1591
02:12:09,581 --> 02:12:10,915
我们可以吗?我不明白。
Can we? I don't see how.

1592
02:12:10,948 --> 02:12:12,650
严格来说，我们现在没油了。
Technically, we're out of fuel right now.

1593
02:12:16,754 --> 02:12:18,456
噢，我们买了。
Uh-oh, we've bought it.

1594
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:34,005
550英尺,队长。
550 feet, Skipper.

1595
02:12:34,038 --> 02:12:35,907
海岸的山丘一定在上升。小心!
The coast hills must be coming up. Watch it!

1596
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:37,509
400，再少一点。
400, a little less.

1597
02:12:37,542 --> 02:12:38,843
挂在!
Hang on!

1598
02:12:41,646 --> 02:12:43,281
330.
330.

1599
02:12:43,315 --> 02:12:44,716
250.
250.

1600
02:12:44,749 --> 02:12:46,151
地面快上来了!
Ground's coming up fast!

1601
02:12:50,255 --> 02:12:52,390
200年,队长。这不是很好。
200, Skipper. This ain't good.

1602
02:12:54,926 --> 02:12:56,161
180.
180.

1603
02:13:03,801 --> 02:13:06,037
42-0，海岸警卫队发来。
4-2-0, from Coast Guard.

1604
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:08,640
一分钟左右，双峰就在你的左边。
Twin Peaks coming up on your left in a minute or so.

1605
02:13:08,673 --> 02:13:10,242
记住那些无线电塔。
Remember those radio towers.

1606
02:13:10,275 --> 02:13:11,409
继续课程。
Stay on course.

1607
02:13:11,443 --> 02:13:12,910
不要再下降了。
Don't descend any more.

1608
02:13:13,811 --> 02:13:15,980
谢谢。我们尽量不这么做。
Thanks. We're trying not to.

1609
02:13:16,823 --> 02:13:18,558
150英尺,队长!
150 feet, Skipper!

1610
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:59,692
300英尺,队长。我们必须经过那些小山。
300 feet, Skipper. We must be past the hills.

1611
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,568
400.
400.

1612
02:15:11,971 --> 02:15:13,806
500. 我们生活!
500. We're living!

1613
02:15:23,116 --> 02:15:26,085
4-2-0，这里是旧金山塔。
4-2-0, this is San Francisco towers.

1614
02:15:26,119 --> 02:15:27,487
特殊天气。
Special weather.

1615
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:30,457
天花板,300英尺。可见,一英里。
Ceiling, 300 feet. Visibility, one mile.

1616
02:15:30,490 --> 02:15:32,392
风,西北西部。
Wind, west northwest.

1617
02:15:32,425 --> 02:15:34,261
20到25。结束了。
20 to 25. Over.

1618
02:15:35,228 --> 02:15:37,464
好的，旧金山塔。
Okay, San Francisco tower.

1619
02:15:37,497 --> 02:15:39,699
我们将进行盲降进近。
We'll make an ILS approach.

1620
02:15:39,732 --> 02:15:42,302
把跑道灯调到最大。
Turn the runway lights up full blast.

1621
02:16:37,123 --> 02:16:38,591
代码的沉默。
Code of silence.

1622
02:16:38,625 --> 02:16:39,959
跟你在一起，朋友。
Right with you, chum.

1623
02:16:39,992 --> 02:16:42,229
我们可以一直往前走了。
We're cleared straight on down.

1624
02:16:42,262 --> 02:16:43,372
这将是一个快速的过程。
This is going to be a fast one.

1625
02:16:43,396 --> 02:16:45,598
待命，检查副翼和起落架。
Stand by, check me with flaps and gear.

1626
02:16:49,836 --> 02:16:51,538
拿外面的记号笔，丹。
Get the outer marker, Dan.

1627
02:16:52,972 --> 02:16:54,574
外标记识别。
Outer marker identified.

1628
02:16:54,607 --> 02:16:57,577
但我们已经远低于下滑道了，小心点，伙计。
But we're way below our glide path, so watch it, chum.

1629
02:16:57,610 --> 02:17:00,613
这附近有个690英尺高的无线电塔。
There's a 690-foot radio tower around here someplace.

1630
02:17:00,647 --> 02:17:03,950
肯定在我们后面，我们就在靠近的地方。
Has to be behind us, we're right on the approach leg.

1631
02:17:03,983 --> 02:17:05,485
等他们安全了再告诉我。
Let me know it when they're clear.

1632
02:17:30,082 --> 02:17:31,983
羽毛,丹!快!没时间玩了。
Feather it, Dan! Quick! No time to fool with it.

1633
02:17:35,887 --> 02:17:37,622
给我全力对付另外两个。
Give me full power on the other two.

1634
02:17:40,825 --> 02:17:42,127
你看到什么吗?
You see anything?

1635
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:43,395
还没有。
Not yet.

1636
02:18:08,153 --> 02:18:09,821
联系了吗?不。
Contact yet? No.

1637
02:18:13,458 --> 02:18:15,593
这是一件毛衣。
This is a sweater.

1638
02:18:15,627 --> 02:18:17,362
你会做得很好的。
You're doing fine.

1639
02:18:18,396 --> 02:18:21,233
等我们通过了内部标记，我就不管不顾地把她推下去。
When we pass the inner marker, I'm shoving her down regardless.

1640
02:18:21,266 --> 02:18:22,367
是的。
Yeah.

1641
02:18:27,339 --> 02:18:29,241
进近灯在正前方。也许一英里。
Approach lights dead ahead. Maybe a mile.

1642
02:18:29,907 --> 02:18:31,309
把装备给她。
Give her the gear.

1643
02:18:32,644 --> 02:18:34,612
三个绿灯和压力。
Three green lights and pressure.

1644
02:18:39,717 --> 02:18:42,620
我们只能再在空中停留30秒。
We can only stay in the air another 30 seconds.

1645
02:18:43,355 --> 02:18:44,722
完整的襟翼。
Full flaps.

1646
02:18:45,357 --> 02:18:46,558
完整的襟翼。
Full flaps.

1647
02:18:58,470 --> 02:19:01,239
现在，我躺下睡觉。
Now, I lay me down to sleep.

1648
02:19:55,993 --> 02:19:57,793
-他们来了。-他们来了。

现在又来了两个。

我不能告诉你。绝对不是。
I couldn't tell you. Not in a million words.

02:20:32,284 --> 02:20:34,028
你的下一部作品是什么，帕迪先生?
What is your next production going to be, Mr. Pardee?

她一定是演艺圈的。
