1
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,301
What the hell?

2
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,349
Hey.

3
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,849
You know which side of the border
you are on?

4
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,266
You got a name for it?

5
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,773
Guess... someone must
have cut your tongue off.

6
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:46,651
Either that, or...

7
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:51,322
Or has something

8
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:54,033
To hide.

9
00:05:57,953 --> 00:05:59,371
As far as I can tell...

10
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:04,707
You hear me plain enough.

11
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,385
Walter Henderson.

12
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:22,140
Now I want to ask you one last question.

13
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,017
You see this here card?

14
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,561
Is this you?

15
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:32,357
Or a relative of yours?

16
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:38,655
Well, I'm going to call up this number.

17
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:42,240
And see if they can tell me who you are.

18
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:46,203
I ain't got beds enough to be putting up mutes.

19
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:58,381
Operator. I need a line out please.

20
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:15,438
What?

21
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,191
What, can you... can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital down there?

22
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,112
Where the hell is that?

23
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,365
Oh, OK, alright.

24
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:31,534
Yeah, OK, I'll be there as fast as I can.

25
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,495
Just, will you tell him that I'm coming, OK?

26
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,788
OK.

27
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,169
Steven, I think you will have to change that...

28
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:46,880
- This section right here?
- Yeah, because it's incomplete.

29
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,549
Ann, honey?

30
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,428
I just got the strangest phone call.

31
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:53,846
Who from?

32
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,807
From some hospital in south Texas.
A place called Terlingua.

33
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,268
They say they found Travis.

34
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:02,894
Oh, no.

35
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:05,439
What are you going to do?

36
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,647
Well, I'll go down and get him.

37
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,065
Oh, wow.

38
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,818
Well, what am I going to do?
I can't leave him down there.

39
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:16,699
What about Hunter?

40
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,326
What am I supposed to tell him?

41
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:22,494
Well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

42
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:24,580
I mean about Travis.

43
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,423
I guess you better tell him the truth.

44
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:59,818
Ten to Vanhorn 90...

45
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:02,863
The Alpine 118 south.

46
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:06,575
Terlingua.

47
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,061
You must be the brother of the mute.

48
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:43,273
- Mute?
- Yeah.

49
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,027
I couldn't squeeze the time of day out of him.

50
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:52,030
Must be in a kind of jam.

51
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:56,326
I don't know, I haven't seen him
in over 4 years.

52
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:58,537
Is that right?

53
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:04,040
Well, a lot can happen
to a man in 4 years.

54
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,626
All kinds of trouble.

55
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:08,920
Bits of trouble.

56
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:10,422
What do you mean?

57
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,964
Well, down here,

58
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:16,009
A man gets himself into a fix sometimes.

59
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,970
It costs him a little to get him out.

60
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,930
If you understand what I mean.

61
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,435
I don't understand you.

62
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,521
I wish you get to the point,
because I'd like to see my brother.

63
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:30,898
Alright son.

64
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:34,152
But first I would like to ask you something.

65
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:39,282
Did your brother ever get himself
into a car wreck?

66
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,411
Car wreck, no...

67
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,288
Not that I know of.

68
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:51,206
Then he must be mixing
with some hard company.

69
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,627
I'd like to see my brother now.
If you don't mind...

70
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:58,171
He disappeared.

71
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,257
You mean he's not here?

72
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,676
After I came all this way?

73
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,929
He's been gone since early this morning.

74
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,849
We have his possessions.
Never the less...

75
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,643
Saved them.

76
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,855
We'd be glad to turn him over to you.

77
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:21,524
Soon, as you take care of our little reward.

78
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:00,402
Travis, hey!

79
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:07,450
Don't you recognize me? It's Walt!

80
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,208
It's your brother, Walt.

81
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:37,809
What the hell happened to you, anyway?

82
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,561
You look like 40 miles of rough road.

83
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,406
Come on, let's get in the car. Trav?

84
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:54,784
Come on...

85
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,666
Here Trav, here's your stuff.

86
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:54,586
Got that back at that clinic back there.

87
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,338
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in.

88
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,883
I don't blame you for running out of it.

89
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:08,763
Look, Trav...

90
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,558
We've got quite a bit of traveling to do here,

91
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:13,935
You're not going to clam up
the whole way, are you?

92
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,687
I'm going to get kinda lonely.

93
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:22,443
Trav?

94
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:28,240
Would you mind telling me
where you disappeared to for the last 4 years?

95
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:36,245
Have you seen Jane, or talked to her?

96
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,083
Ann and I are...

97
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,794
We sort of gave up on you. We actually...

98
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:46,754
We thought you were dead, boy.

99
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,370
This is pretty a...

100
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:36,923
You OK?

101
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:46,766
Well...

102
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:53,938
Well, gee Trav, maybe you want to...

103
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,941
Clean up. Take a shower or something?

104
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,571
I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new cloths.

105
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,404
You could use a new set of cloths, couldn’t you?

106
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:07,075
What size shoes do you wear?

107
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:10,952
Lets see...

108
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,457
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

109
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,670
So, where did you find that beard?

110
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:23,172
It's pretty snazzy.

111
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:30,553
OK, I'll zip into town and zip right back.

112
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,390
I won't be gone long.

113
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:42,647
You'll be OK, won't you, Trav?

114
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,736
OK, I'll be right back.

115
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:41,208
Damn it.

116
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:42,261
You mind telling me
where you are headed, Trav?

117
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:47,975
What's out there?

118
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,566
There's nothing out there.

119
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:01,654
Don't you trust me or something?

120
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,493
I'm just trying to help you Trav, that's all.

121
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,207
Come on, it's alright.

122
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,376
Come on with me in the car.

123
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:26,977
Feels good to be in new cloths, huh?

124
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:53,666
Hi, Hunter? It's Daddy.

125
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,793
I thought you'd be in bed already.

126
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,841
Guess who I'm visiting, here in Texas.

127
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:05,512
Your father.

128
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:07,931
Do you remember your father?

129
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,517
Not at all?

130
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:15,937
He was?

131
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,190
Well, guess what?

132
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,817
I'm going to bring him home to visit.

133
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,081
Travis

134
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:45,587
Do you remember your little boy?
Hunter?

135
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,174
Well, he's with us.

136
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,344
He's been living with Ann and me
ever since you disappeared.

137
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:57,889
We didn't know what else to do.

138
00:23:58,223 --> 00:23:59,808
So, we just kept him.

139
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:04,645
One day, he was just standing at the door.

140
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,442
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

141
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,361
He didn't know what had happened to you,

142
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,195
Or Jane.

143
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:17,991
So we tried everything we could
think of to find you, or Jane.

144
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,994
Tried to locate her, she vanished too.

145
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,789
We didn't know what else to do.

146
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,544
Travis,

147
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:34,505
I don't know what kind of trouble
you got into.

148
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,341
I don't know what happened.

149
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,887
But damn it, I'm your brother man.

150
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,056
You can talk to me.

151
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:51,436
I'm tired of doing all the taking.

152
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:35,933
Fill it with unleaded please.

153
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:41,729
You know, I'm getting a little sick
with this silence routine.

154
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:43,982
You can talk.

155
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,658
I can be silent too you know.

156
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:01,205
I just assumed that if we kept
our mouths shut for the rest of the trip

157
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:03,082
- Paris.
- What?

158
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:07,167
Paris.

159
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:14,133
Paris?

160
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:16,343
Paris?

161
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,847
Did you ever go to Paris?

162
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:23,099
No.

163
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:25,768
Could we go there now?

164
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:30,148
It's a little out of the way.

165
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:36,402
Ah, I've never even been to Europe.

166
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:38,195
Ann keeps on wanting to go there.

167
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:41,282
Cus, she is from France, you remember?

168
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:43,532
But we never seem to find the time,

169
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:46,409
Because my company kinda keeps me busy.

170
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:02,966
Lets go Trav.

171
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:07,429
What's the matter?

172
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:09,222
Where are we going?

173
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:10,930
We're going to fly to L.A.

174
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,349
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

175
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,811
- Leaving the ground?
- Yeah.

176
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:19,105
Why?

177
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:21,231
Because it's too far to drive.

178
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:23,901
It would take an extra 2 days,
I can't afford the time, Trav.

179
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:25,402
Why?

180
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:30,825
It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster. Come on.

181
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:51,759
It's all OK.

182
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:55,180
When I get you home, I'll get you settled
and then you can do whatever you want.

183
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:59,892
But sir, we can't stop the plane
whenever someone gets terrified.

184
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,852
Don't get on a plane and then
refuse to leave the ground.

185
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,980
Don't do things like that,
this isn't the wilderness.

186
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,399
You're living with people now.

187
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:12,695
You should have acquired a private plane,
do you know how many people you are detaining?

188
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:14,154
Sorry!

189
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:16,949
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! OK?

190
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,327
This is getting a little ridiculous Travis.

191
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,497
Are you going to leave me?

192
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,415
No, I'm not going to leave you.

193
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,710
It's alright if you leave me.

194
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:36,381
I don't know honey, no...
He just panicked or something.

195
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,801
Well, it won't do any good to try
another plane, it wasn't the plane,

196
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:42,511
he'll just get off again.

197
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,557
Well, we're just going to
have to drive it, that's all.

198
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,851
Yeah, it'll take a good 2 days.

199
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:56,148
I don't understand why you have to
have the exact same car you had before.

200
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,816
They are all alike.

201
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,901
All the cars we have here are Birds,

202
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:02,196
Olds, Chevy’s, and whatever.

203
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,156
- I'm not even sure I can locate the same car...
- I know...

204
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:09,910
My brother left something in the car,
we are hoping we can search the car and find it.

205
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,372
Oh, well, I'll just contact the lost
and found department for you, if that's OK sir.

206
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:15,457
No, we have to have the very same car.

207
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,834
Well, I can't do that.
There is no way I can trace the car for you.

208
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,795
Well, why not?
You have the license number
right on your form there.

209
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:24,381
- Well, yes but...
- Well, just give us the license number
and we'll find it.

210
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:27,009
But I can't allow you on the lot sir.

211
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,636
Why not? We're already on it!

212
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,555
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

213
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:38,102
- Travis!
- What?

214
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:41,481
I don't think we're going to get the very same car.

215
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:44,940
But I can rent you a model
just like the one you had before, sir.

216
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,111
I need the same car Walt.
How are we going to go in another car?

217
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:52,863
Give us the number, will you, please?

218
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:55,740
Come on... pretty please?

219
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,329
Alright, that number is 667DJP

220
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:03,831
You remember that? 667DJP?

221
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:06,460
- It's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes it does...

222
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:23,264
What's that?

223
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,557
What?

224
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:26,226
That, what you got in your hand?

225
00:30:27,852 --> 00:30:28,937
A picture.

226
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,729
A picture of what?

227
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,898
A picture of...

228
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,442
Paris.

229
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,987
Paris, really?

230
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,698
Yes, picture of a piece of Paris.

231
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,992
Where did you get a picture of Paris?

232
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,078
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

233
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:50,330
This is it?
This is Paris?

234
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,084
Looks just like Texas to me.

235
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,627
It is.

236
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:56,712
Paris, Texas?

237
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:58,756
It's right here on the map.

238
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,381
There's really a place called Paris, Texas?

239
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:02,049
It's right here.

240
00:31:04,802 --> 00:31:07,721
Well, how come you got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

241
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:09,848
It's mine.

242
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,017
I know that, but how come you got it?

243
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:17,480
I purchased it in the mail...

244
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:19,441
A long time ago.

245
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,777
You bought a picture
of vacant lot in the mail?

246
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:25,154
No, I bought the land...

247
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:27,779
- Oh, you bought that lot.
- Yes.

248
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:29,156
Oh, let me see again.

249
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,493
There's nothing on it.

250
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,037
Empty.

251
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:40,957
Well, why in hell would you want to buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas for Christ's sake?

252
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,634
I forgot.

253
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:55,888
Here Trav.

254
00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:06,646
Do you remember
what mama's very first name was?

255
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:08,648
Marry.

256
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:13,779
No, I know, I mean, her...
before she found daddy.

257
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:15,987
- Oh, her median name?
- Yeah.

258
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,866
You don't remember her median name?

259
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:20,451
No...

260
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:22,745
Sekinae.

261
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:25,413
Sekinae.

262
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:26,873
Spanish.

263
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,665
Her father was.

264
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:30,334
Yeah?

265
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,633
I don't believe it.

266
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:41,803
You finally decided to eat!

267
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:44,763
Eating and talking!

268
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,849
Before you know it,
you will be back in the land of the living.

269
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:53,521
You want me to drive?

270
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,607
Sure! Think you remember how?

271
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:58,859
My body remembers.

272
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:06,197
You can sleep while I drive.

273
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:08,408
OK.

274
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:24,881
Well, Trav...

275
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:27,676
I think maybe you are ready to...

276
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:30,846
Tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last 4 years.

277
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,723
No, not yet.

278
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:11,963
Travis!

279
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:13,506
What?

280
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:31,608
Where are we, Travis?
What happened?

281
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:35,360
Why did we get off the high way.

282
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:38,155
Jesus Christ...

283
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:40,906
I can't even sleep for 5 minutes
without some crisis.

284
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,574
Why did you turn off?

285
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:49,329
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

286
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:52,999
That's great.

287
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,959
That's just damn great.

288
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,796
Where we are in the middle of the Mohabi desert
and a place that doesn't have a name.

289
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:03,342
I could find the high way again.

290
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:27,070
Trav, I need to talk to you a little
about Hunter.

291
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:29,614
How old is he now?

292
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:32,575
He's eight in January.

293
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:35,662
- She’s seven then.
- Yeah.

294
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:40,374
But see, what I want to talk about is...

295
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:45,629
Well, he's like part of the family now.

296
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:49,758
Ann and me are like his parents now.

297
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:52,301
Ann's your wife.

298
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:54,262
Yeah, you remember her, don't you?

299
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,264
No... Does he think
that you're his father?

300
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:03,103
Well, Ann told him you were coming.

301
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:06,814
Well, who does he think I am?

302
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:11,444
I told him you are his father.

303
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:13,819
But see,

304
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:17,071
You've been gone a long time, Trav.

305
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:19,866
How long have I been gone? Do you know?

306
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:22,618
4 years.

307
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:26,330
Is 4 years a long time?

308
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,334
It is for a little boy.

309
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:34,378
It's half his life.

310
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,592
Half a boy's life.

311
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:43,762
I remember now...

312
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:45,597
What?

313
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:50,727
Why I bought that land.

314
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:52,436
Oh, why?

315
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,813
Well, mama once told me that...

316
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,691
That's where she and daddy first...

317
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:00,360
Made love.

318
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:03,071
Oh, in Paris, Texas?

319
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,532
- Yeah.
- She told you that?

320
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:07,532
Yeah.

321
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:13,372
So... I thought that...

322
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,208
that's where I began.

323
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:21,586
I mean me, Travis Calve Henderson.
They named me that.

324
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:24,547
I started out there.

325
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:29,219
- Paris Texas, huh?
- Yeah...

326
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,473
So you think
maybe you were conceived there?

327
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:38,101
Yeah.

328
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:39,895
You could be right, Travis.

329
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:44,359
Daddy always had a joke about it.

330
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:46,902
What was the joke?

331
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,570
He's... he would introduce mama

332
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:53,240
As the girl he met in Paris.

333
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:55,158
And then he would wait

334
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,245
Before he said Texas,
so everybody thought that...

335
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,540
He meant...
He would wait

336
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,251
Before he said Texas
till everybody thought,

337
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,712
After everybody thought
that he was talking about Paris, France.

338
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,588
He always laughed real hard about it.

339
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,636
So you live in Los Angles, huh?

340
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:20,139
Yeah, well we live in suburbs,

341
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:22,349
But I've got my business in town.

342
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:24,475
What's your business?

343
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,561
I make billboard signs for advertisements.

344
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:29,855
Oh, yeah?

345
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:33,567
You're the one that makes all those...
I love those.

346
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,235
Some of them are beautiful.

347
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:37,902
I'm not the only one in the world
that make's them, Trav.

348
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,676
Trav? This way.

349
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,554
Nice, huh?
Just been in here 3 months.

350
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,974
I really like it,
but I took a beating financing, I'll tell ya.

351
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,602
Like everybody else.

352
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:21,941
Hi baby.

353
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,486
- Everything OK here?
- Oh, sure...

354
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:27,820
We just miss you a lot.

355
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,280
I missed you too.

356
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:32,408
- Come on in.
- Travis.

357
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:38,748
My God.

358
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:43,042
We were beginning to wonder
if we would ever see you again.

359
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:45,086
It's been so long.

360
00:39:46,504 --> 00:39:48,047
Did you have a good trip?

361
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:49,965
Yeah, it was fine.

362
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:54,551
Hunter.

363
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:08,064
Hunter.

364
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:10,191
This is Travis.

365
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,413
Hi.

366
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,501
Hi.

367
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:43,053
I bet it was really hot
coming across the Mohabis Desert.

368
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:47,432
Yes.

369
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,600
Too bad you had to drive.

370
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:52,061
What happened?

371
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:55,815
Well, Travis just didn't feel like flying.

372
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:58,191
Oh, I don't blame you.

373
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:00,443
I can't stand airplanes anymore.

374
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:02,361
Especially since we live in this house.

375
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:06,325
All we hear is planes day in and day out.

376
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:07,492
I like them.

377
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,043
You used to fly, didn't you, Travis?

378
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,878
No.

379
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,175
Oh, I thought...
I remember

380
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,262
Jane telling me
that you flew once to Dallas together.

381
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,307
Or somewhere.

382
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:37,768
Maybe I'm mistaken.

383
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:01,079
Honey.
He hasn't slept in a bed

384
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:03,581
Since we started, I swear to God.

385
00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:05,833
I don't think that's even necessary.

386
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,337
Where has he been sleeping then?

387
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:10,923
Well, he doesn't sleep.

388
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:13,508
He has to sleep somewhere.

389
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:15,009
OK.

390
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:17,761
But I don't think he's even going to use it.

391
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,514
He's got to get tired sometime.

392
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,185
There is a towel for you, Travis,

393
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:30,105
And some underwear and socks from Walt.

394
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:33,400
Good night.

395
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:36,651
Thank you.

396
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:43,992
OK.
Get some shut eye.

397
00:42:44,617 --> 00:42:45,618
OK.

398
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,246
- Sweet dreams.
- Alright.

399
00:43:58,306 --> 00:43:59,807
You polished them.

400
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,520
That's very nice of you Travis.

401
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:08,774
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

402
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,442
Aren’t you hungry?

403
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,404
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

404
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,449
Do you like them?

405
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,033
Do you want some?

406
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,796
Well, there is hot coffee on the stove
if you want some.

407
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,133
Look at that truck.

408
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:18,835
Hi.

409
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,492
Decided to rough it, huh?

410
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,660
Yeah.

411
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,580
What did you do, spit shine these?

412
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:02,623
I can get you a job
at the airport doing that.

413
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,919
Do you want to trade these new boots
for those old boots?

414
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:11,255
You can wear them.

415
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:14,923
Thank you.

416
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:47,078
Travis? I have to rush off
to get Hunter to school on time.

417
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:49,246
We will be back this afternoon.

418
00:46:49,622 --> 00:46:52,498
Walt's office number is
on the dining room table.

419
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,291
See you later.

420
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:56,919
- OK.
- Bye.

421
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:32,657
- Ann?
- Yeah?

422
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:35,953
I was just thinking
maybe I can meet Hunter after school

423
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:38,414
And we could walk home together,
if he wants to.

424
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:41,416
That sounds like a great idea, Travis.

425
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:46,878
Walk home?
I don't want to walk home mom.

426
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:50,841
Why walk, everybody drives.

427
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:52,718
Come on, Hunter

428
00:47:52,718 --> 00:47:54,971
It won't hurt you
once to walk home in your life.

429
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:57,180
No, no, I don't want to.

430
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,225
Travis, I insist, you are Hunter's father.

431
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:06,857
And get into the car Hunter.
We are late as it is.

432
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:13,069
You are mean.

433
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:18,668
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

434
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:59,120
I'm very sorry about this, Travis.

435
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,705
It's not easy for him, Ann.

436
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,046
Ann, it's OK, he's in here.

437
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,723
What are you doing?

438
00:50:22,307 --> 00:50:23,308
Driving.

439
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,393
Where to?

440
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:27,978
Just driving.

441
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:30,689
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

442
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:32,314
No.

443
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:40,528
Hunter. Travis is your real dad,

444
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:41,571
You know that, don't you?

445
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:46,451
Dad, when are they going to
make spaceships like they...

446
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:48,286
Make cars?

447
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,373
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

448
00:50:54,374 --> 00:50:55,542
What?

449
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:02,257
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

450
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:04,051
And he wanted to walk you home.

451
00:51:05,093 --> 00:51:06,719
Nobody walks.

452
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:09,262
That's not the point.

453
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,849
Travis is your real dad and...

454
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:14,809
He wants to talk to you.

455
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:19,647
Why? What about?

456
00:51:22,024 --> 00:51:23,944
OK, come on. Lets go have dinner.

457
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:39,958
Hey Trav? Do you remember that time
when Ann and me came down
to visit you about 5 years ago?

458
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:44,044
No.

459
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:47,171
You and Jane were down in Texas,
right there on the coast.

460
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:49,590
Hunter was about 3.

461
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:51,926
Don't you remember that?

462
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:56,763
No.

463
00:51:56,972 --> 00:51:58,974
I remember, we went fishing.

464
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:01,309
Yeah.

465
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:04,896
I took some Super Eight on that trip.
And I put it all together?

466
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,604
Thought maybe you might
want to see some of it.

467
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:08,815
What is it?

468
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,066
Movies. You know, Super Eight?

469
00:52:11,858 --> 00:52:13,443
- Oh.
- Walt.

470
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:16,154
Maybe Travis doesn't want...

471
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:18,365
What?

472
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:23,619
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

473
00:52:25,745 --> 00:52:26,913
Yeah, it's up to him.

474
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:29,250
Just thought you might like to see some of it.

475
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,003
Movies? Sure.

476
00:52:32,253 --> 00:52:36,005
Great. There's some great stuff on it.
Some great shots of Hunter on it.

477
00:52:36,964 --> 00:52:38,173
I've already seen it.

478
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:39,925
Well, you have to see it again.

479
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:43,721
- Come on, help me set up the projector.
- OK.

480
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,507
That’s me driving.

481
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:15,884
I know, you are going to be good.

482
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:22,880
Time for bed now, Hunter.

483
00:57:23,964 --> 00:57:26,049
Oh, mom.

484
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,384
Time to go to bed, it's past ten.

485
00:57:30,886 --> 00:57:32,971
- Good night dad.
- Good night baby.

486
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,435
Good night dad.

487
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:48,735
Do you think he still loves her?

488
00:57:49,193 --> 00:57:51,153
How would I know that, Hunter?

489
00:57:52,278 --> 00:57:53,905
I think he does.

490
00:57:55,699 --> 00:57:56,825
How can you tell?

491
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:58,952
Well, the way he looked at her.

492
00:57:59,536 --> 00:58:01,246
You mean when he saw her in the movie?

493
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:04,374
Yeah, but that's not her.

494
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,167
What do you mean?

495
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:09,420
That's only her in a movie.

496
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:12,757
A long time ago.

497
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:16,427
In a galaxy far, far away.

498
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:55,377
What are you looking for?

499
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:58,211
I'm looking for a...

500
00:58:59,587 --> 00:59:00,505
The father.

501
00:59:00,881 --> 00:59:01,841
Your father?

502
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:05,176
No, no, just a father.
Any father.

503
00:59:05,552 --> 00:59:07,136
What does a father look like?

504
00:59:07,762 --> 00:59:09,847
There are many different kinds of fathers,
senior Travis.

505
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:12,641
Well, I just need one.

506
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,268
You think you are going to find him in there?

507
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:16,103
Well, I don't know where else to look.

508
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:19,439
Oh, I see, you want too look like a father.

509
00:59:20,816 --> 00:59:21,816
Yeah.

510
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:26,194
Tell me, do you want to be a rich father?

511
00:59:28,196 --> 00:59:29,155
No.

512
00:59:29,447 --> 00:59:31,074
- A poor one?
- No.

513
00:59:32,492 --> 00:59:33,661
Than which?

514
00:59:34,076 --> 00:59:34,994
In between.

515
00:59:34,994 --> 00:59:37,580
No, no. There is no in between, eh?

516
00:59:37,872 --> 00:59:39,957
You either have to be a rich father
or a poor one.

517
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:41,625
Rich.

518
00:59:58,098 --> 00:59:59,682
One thing you must remember.

519
00:59:59,932 --> 01:00:03,684
To be a rich father, senior Travis,
you must look to the sky,

520
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,186
Never to the ground.

521
01:00:07,439 --> 01:00:08,648
Little higher.

522
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,073
No... Stand.

523
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,867
You must walk stiff, senior Travis.

524
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:32,668
Dignity.

525
01:00:49,518 --> 01:00:50,725
You got it.

526
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:13,288
Who is that guy, you know him?

527
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:16,332
Yeah, he's my father's brother.

528
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:23,255
No... they are both brothers.

529
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:26,591
No, they are both fathers.

530
01:01:28,925 --> 01:01:30,885
No... ah, forget it.

531
01:01:31,261 --> 01:01:33,681
- But both who's fathers?
- My father.

532
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:36,350
How they have two fathers?

533
01:01:36,517 --> 01:01:38,058
Just lucky I guess.

534
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:41,310
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

535
01:03:33,826 --> 01:03:35,159
That's my dad's suite.

536
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:38,287
I mean Walt.

537
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:40,540
That's OK if you call him dad.

538
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:44,377
Yeah, I borrowed it from him.
He said it was OK.

539
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:51,590
What are those pictures?

540
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:53,884
That's my dad.

541
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:57,055
And your grandfather.

542
01:04:00,932 --> 01:04:02,142
What was his name?

543
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,227
Travis.

544
01:04:04,352 --> 01:04:05,937
Same as yours.

545
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,523
Where is he now?

546
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:11,525
He died...

547
01:04:12,442 --> 01:04:14,443
A couple of years after this picture.

548
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:16,362
In that car.

549
01:04:16,737 --> 01:04:18,656
- Oh, he's dead?
- Uh huh.

550
01:04:20,241 --> 01:04:22,452
But can you feel that he's dead?

551
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:24,287
What do you mean?

552
01:04:24,912 --> 01:04:26,538
You knew him
when he was walking around

553
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:29,291
- And talking. Right?
- Yeah.

554
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:32,127
So can you feel that he is gone?

555
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,590
Yeah, sometimes.
I know he's dead.

556
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:40,967
I never felt like you were dead.

557
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:42,802
I could always feel you were walking

558
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:46,014
Around and talking... some place.

559
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:48,473
I feel mom too.

560
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,266
- You do?
- Don't you?

561
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:53,768
Yeah.

562
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,150
That's me when I was in the navy.

563
01:05:00,485 --> 01:05:01,653
You were a general?

564
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:05,198
No... This was when I was in the band.

565
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,240
The high school band.

566
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:13,038
This is you. I like this picture.
Look at that.

567
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:15,040
That is really wild.

568
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:18,291
That's weird when it,
when there is water in between

569
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:21,252
And then it turns into nothing.

570
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:24,088
That's a great picture.

571
01:05:25,298 --> 01:05:26,757
And this is my mom.

572
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:29,717
Your grandmother.

573
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:36,475
I didn't know.

574
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:41,688
It just seems that...

575
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:45,066
Everything has changed between us so fast.

576
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:47,275
Ever since Travis came.

577
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:48,777
What's changed?

578
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:52,155
I'm just afraid.

579
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,323
Afraid of Travis?

580
01:05:56,157 --> 01:05:57,117
No...

581
01:05:57,992 --> 01:05:59,494
Then what?

582
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,790
Of what will happen to us if we loose Hunter.

583
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:10,045
We're not going to loose Hunter.

584
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,090
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

585
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:16,426
It's almost as if you wanted them to leave.

586
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,388
- Who?
- Hunter.

587
01:06:20,638 --> 01:06:22,807
You know what I'm talking about.

588
01:06:23,182 --> 01:06:26,392
You keep promoting this
father son business between...

589
01:06:26,851 --> 01:06:28,352
It's not business.

590
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,565
Travis is his father,
and Hunter is his son.

591
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:34,773
That's a fact.

592
01:06:35,315 --> 01:06:36,859
You've known that all along.

593
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,363
Travis happens to be my brother.

594
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:41,781
I know he is.

595
01:06:42,115 --> 01:06:44,199
Well, what's this promotion bull shit?

596
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,033
You want us to go on pretending...

597
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,828
That we are the parents
of my brother's son?

598
01:06:49,537 --> 01:06:51,289
Well, how long do you want Hunter
to buy that?

599
01:06:51,622 --> 01:06:53,875
I was never pretending.

600
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:58,004
I love him, just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

601
01:06:59,588 --> 01:07:00,797
So do I.

602
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:12,640
Hi Ann.

603
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,225
Hi Travis.

604
01:07:14,934 --> 01:07:16,895
You don't sleep much, do you?

605
01:07:26,903 --> 01:07:28,196
Travis.

606
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:31,491
There is something I have to tell you.

607
01:07:31,824 --> 01:07:33,493
I was not going to,

608
01:07:33,826 --> 01:07:37,329
Because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

609
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:41,290
I never even told Walt, or Hunter.

610
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:44,210
What is it?

611
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:49,798
After Hunter came to live with us,

612
01:07:50,548 --> 01:07:51,966
Jane used to call.

613
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:55,512
Asking about him.

614
01:07:56,012 --> 01:08:00,139
She made me promise not to tell anyone
that she was calling.

615
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:02,099
Did she ask about me?

616
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:07,521
Yes. In the beginning.

617
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:13,151
Where did she call from?

618
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:16,195
Places in Texas.

619
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:17,947
What places?

620
01:08:21,868 --> 01:08:23,370
Let me finish, Travis.

621
01:08:26,456 --> 01:08:29,499
After what happened
between you and Jane...

622
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:33,628
She decided Hunter should be with us.

623
01:08:35,213 --> 01:08:38,006
She said she couldn't be a mother to him anymore.

624
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:49,183
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

625
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:04,898
Travis. I don't want to feel I'm...

626
01:09:05,065 --> 01:09:07,402
Hiding something from you anymore.

627
01:09:13,242 --> 01:09:14,493
She was young...

628
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,710
She wanted something,

629
01:09:21,835 --> 01:09:24,088
But I just couldn't figure out what it was.

630
01:09:31,138 --> 01:09:33,850
I just didn't realize how much rage I had.

631
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:45,529
A little more than a year ago
she stopped calling.

632
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:48,200
I haven't heard from her since then.

633
01:09:49,868 --> 01:09:50,869
Nothing?

634
01:09:52,538 --> 01:09:53,539
Not a word.

635
01:09:54,999 --> 01:09:56,585
But on the last call,

636
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:01,216
She asked for me
to open a bank account for Hunter.

637
01:10:03,009 --> 01:10:04,427
A bank account?

638
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:07,098
All I know about Jane now is...

639
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:09,809
She goes to this bank.

640
01:10:10,392 --> 01:10:12,645
On the 5th of each month...

641
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:15,315
And wires money for Hunter.

642
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:22,115
Jane, still sends him money.

643
01:10:23,616 --> 01:10:27,996
Sometimes a hundred dollars,
sometimes 50, or 5...

644
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:30,667
For Hunter's future.

645
01:10:31,584 --> 01:10:33,838
I had the bank trace the wire.

646
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:36,882
It comes from a bank in Huston.

647
01:10:37,508 --> 01:10:38,884
What bank?

648
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:43,098
I wrote it down if you want it.

649
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:47,770
What's the date today?

650
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,939
The first of November.

651
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:58,449
I don't think we should do that. You're right.

652
01:11:01,954 --> 01:11:03,581
I meant the other thing.

653
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:27,692
You will all be caught
with your diapers down.

654
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:29,694
That is a promise!

655
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:34,201
I give you this promise on my mother's head!

656
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:40,458
For right here today,
standing on the very head of my mother.

657
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,419
Which is how a god treats her.

658
01:11:43,836 --> 01:11:47,467
Which everybody who wasn't bought
in a fucking store.

659
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:52,222
Wanna know and understand
to the very letter what death holds.

660
01:11:54,058 --> 01:11:56,685
They will invade you in your beds,

661
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,357
They will snap you from your hot tubs.

662
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:05,445
They will pluck you right
out of your expensive sports cars.

663
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,450
There is no where.

664
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,121
Absolutely no where...

665
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:15,166
In this God forsaken valley.

666
01:12:16,126 --> 01:12:20,756
I'm talking about from the rage
of my voice right here...

667
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:24,260
Clear out to the goddamn
Mojave desert.

668
01:12:24,635 --> 01:12:28,515
And beyond that.
Clear up this mess though.

669
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:33,478
For everywhere else in the valley
always had a sona.

670
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:37,775
None of that area will be
called the safety zone.

671
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:40,530
There will be no safety zone.

672
01:12:40,864 --> 01:12:42,782
I can guarantee this safety zone...

673
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:44,617
Will be eliminated,

674
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:46,327
Eradicated.

675
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:51,750
You will all be exerdited
to the land of no return.

676
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:55,130
It's eradication to no where.

677
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:58,383
And if you think that's going to be fun,

678
01:12:58,925 --> 01:13:01,053
You've got another thing coming.

679
01:13:03,222 --> 01:13:05,391
They made me a slime bucket.

680
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:09,938
But believe me,
I know what the hell I'm talking about.

681
01:13:10,606 --> 01:13:12,150
I'm not crazy.

682
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:16,864
And don't say I didn't warn you.
I warned you.

683
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:18,866
I warned all of you.

684
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:32,089
Thought you were afraid of heights.

685
01:13:32,757 --> 01:13:35,385
No, I'm not afraid of heights,
I'm afraid of falling.

686
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,930
Oh, yeah? Well then just don't look down.

687
01:13:41,643 --> 01:13:44,312
To bad the things don't look
the same on the ground.

688
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:46,232
What do you mean?

689
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:49,945
Things are clearer up here.

690
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:52,989
Might clear things up.

691
01:13:53,156 --> 01:13:55,660
Yeah, I had a talk with Ann last night.

692
01:13:56,452 --> 01:13:57,954
Yeah, she is pretty upset.

693
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:00,331
Yeah, I know.

694
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:03,377
I'm going to leave.

695
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:06,088
- What?
- I'm leaving.

696
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:10,426
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave.
I'm not trying to get rid of you, Travis.

697
01:14:10,552 --> 01:14:12,846
- I know that.
- Well, what good is that going to do?

698
01:14:12,846 --> 01:14:14,598
- I wanna...
- That's not going to solve anything.

699
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,434
I'm going to go find Jane.

700
01:14:18,979 --> 01:14:20,272
How you going to do that?

701
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:23,025
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared.

702
01:14:23,401 --> 01:14:25,278
I tried to find her, I tried everything,
I couldn't find her.

703
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:28,157
Now, I haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

704
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:29,283
What make's you so sure?

705
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:31,034
Oh, I just know.

706
01:14:31,702 --> 01:14:32,911
Can we go down now?

707
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:36,541
No! God damn it!

708
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,210
You tell me what happened Travis!

709
01:14:39,627 --> 01:14:41,088
I'm sick of this fucking mystery!

710
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:43,090
I've been treating you
like a spoiled kid...

711
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:44,758
Ever since I picked you up in the desert.

712
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:47,929
Now you tell me what happened,
with you and Jane!

713
01:14:48,972 --> 01:14:49,806
Shit!

714
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:53,519
I know it's none of my business.

715
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,816
Uh, well, I need to take...

716
01:14:59,026 --> 01:15:01,154
Money, credit cards.

717
01:15:01,654 --> 01:15:03,239
Alright, sure, you can have them.

718
01:15:03,406 --> 01:15:04,532
You know you'll get it back.

719
01:15:04,824 --> 01:15:06,367
Oh, forget that. You can have them.

720
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,204
I want to find her, Walt.

721
01:15:34,401 --> 01:15:35,570
Hunter!

722
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:46,874
That your car?

723
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,340
Yup! Come on!

724
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,303
Radical.

725
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:11,904
This is not bad stuff.

726
01:16:13,906 --> 01:16:15,909
Ann puts it in lunch everyday.

727
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,204
Lavash, Ki, Ri. Sticky.

728
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:20,873
Lavash, what?

729
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,627
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

730
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:26,629
Ri, Rrrr, Ri.

731
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:29,467
I like it.

732
01:16:31,678 --> 01:16:33,346
- Dad.
- Yap?

733
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,600
Where did you go all that time?

734
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,313
Mexico.

735
01:16:40,938 --> 01:16:42,357
How come?

736
01:16:44,193 --> 01:16:45,903
I didn't know where else to go.

737
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:49,532
Where did mom go?

738
01:16:51,451 --> 01:16:52,494
I don't know.

739
01:16:53,453 --> 01:16:55,079
But right now, she is somewhere in Huston.

740
01:16:55,706 --> 01:16:57,458
That's where the space center is.

741
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:03,508
And that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

742
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:05,801
I have to go away now.

743
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:07,470
Why?

744
01:17:08,597 --> 01:17:09,848
Because I'm going to find her.

745
01:17:10,098 --> 01:17:13,227
What about me, you just found me.
Can I come with?

746
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:19,442
What about Walt and Ann?

747
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:22,363
We would never come back here?

748
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:23,989
Sure, but...

749
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:26,158
I don't know when.

750
01:17:36,296 --> 01:17:37,548
I want to come with.

751
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:42,512
I want to find her too.

752
01:17:43,137 --> 01:17:44,389
When do we go?

753
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:50,813
Right now.

754
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:52,773
Then, come on, lets go.

755
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,027
First we have to stop
to get supplies for the trip.

756
01:17:56,111 --> 01:17:56,945
OK.

757
01:18:12,589 --> 01:18:14,340
We got to buy jackets, tee shirts,

758
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,385
Tooth brushes, stuff like that.

759
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:18,387
Maybe even walky talkies.

760
01:18:18,888 --> 01:18:20,347
Talkies of course.

761
01:18:20,973 --> 01:18:22,057
Just in case.

762
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:33,196
Do you know what?

763
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:34,697
What?

764
01:18:36,284 --> 01:18:39,747
This whole galaxy, the whole universe...

765
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,877
Used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

766
01:18:44,794 --> 01:18:47,297
- And you know what happened?
- What?

767
01:18:48,131 --> 01:18:50,676
It went "Phchue..."
and blew up.

768
01:18:51,052 --> 01:18:54,347
All the spark, flying every place,

769
01:18:54,639 --> 01:18:56,475
In space...

770
01:18:57,351 --> 01:18:59,269
It was just gas. It was flowing around.

771
01:18:59,645 --> 01:19:00,646
The earth was?

772
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:02,982
Yeah, the earth was really gas.

773
01:19:03,358 --> 01:19:06,736
And the sun formed, and it was so hot...

774
01:19:07,028 --> 01:19:11,534
That the earth just formed
into one hard ball.

775
01:19:11,992 --> 01:19:14,663
Of ocean. Nothing but ocean.

776
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,416
So there was sea animals and...

777
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:21,170
Under the water,
a volcano went..."Pachooo"

778
01:19:22,004 --> 01:19:24,341
And... The hot lava hit the water...

779
01:19:24,424 --> 01:19:27,427
And formed rock to make land.

780
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,735
If you want to make a collect call,

781
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,864
You dial the operator and tell her that...

782
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,074
I know.

783
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:47,827
Good, then call Walt and Ann.

784
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:49,161
Why?

785
01:19:49,746 --> 01:19:51,582
Because, so they don't worry about you,

786
01:19:51,623 --> 01:19:52,708
So they know where you are.

787
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:54,668
But what am I going to say?

788
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,044
Just tell them the truth.

789
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:59,799
Tell them that you are with me,
and on to Texas.

790
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:02,135
They are going to flip out.

791
01:20:02,468 --> 01:20:05,139
No... but you can handle it.

792
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:06,348
OK?

793
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:08,058
Why can't you do it?

794
01:20:08,434 --> 01:20:09,978
I can't do it.

795
01:20:11,396 --> 01:20:12,480
Why?

796
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:14,858
Because it has to be you.

797
01:20:17,821 --> 01:20:20,324
Oh, jeez...

798
01:20:20,741 --> 01:20:22,701
Why can't he do anything?

799
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:30,502
- Hello.
- Hi dad.

800
01:20:30,711 --> 01:20:32,254
Hunter. Where are you?

801
01:20:32,588 --> 01:20:35,090
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

802
01:20:38,845 --> 01:20:41,306
Yeah, yeah. Hunter, just listen to me now.

803
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,809
Where are you, exactly?

804
01:20:46,437 --> 01:20:48,022
St. Vernidino?

805
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:51,444
Hunter, what do you mean
you are in St. Vernidino?

806
01:20:51,986 --> 01:20:52,862
Wait a minute honey.

807
01:20:53,029 --> 01:20:54,697
- How did...
- Let me talk to him.

808
01:20:55,907 --> 01:20:57,034
Hunter.

809
01:20:57,826 --> 01:20:59,245
Are you alright?

810
01:20:59,453 --> 01:21:00,538
Yeah.

811
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,581
What are you doing?

812
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:06,753
With Travis?

813
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:10,967
Why are you going?

814
01:21:13,719 --> 01:21:17,516
Tell me where you are Hunter.
Just tell me where you are.

815
01:21:19,518 --> 01:21:21,228
What's the name of it?

816
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,774
Oh, my god.

817
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,068
Hunter.

818
01:21:26,944 --> 01:21:29,530
You tell Travis, to turn around...

819
01:21:29,863 --> 01:21:32,450
And come back right now.

820
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,327
Do you understand me?

821
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:36,454
Let me talk to him.

822
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:39,292
What should I do?

823
01:21:40,251 --> 01:21:42,044
Just hang up.

824
01:21:44,798 --> 01:21:46,717
Bye mom. Got to go now.

825
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:50,137
Hunter...?

826
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:53,057
Hunter!

827
01:22:10,496 --> 01:22:11,497
Did they flip out?

828
01:22:11,873 --> 01:22:13,124
Yeah, she did.

829
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,585
You're not sorry you came, are you?

830
01:22:15,668 --> 01:22:16,544
No.

831
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,673
Well, you can go back to them
any time you want.

832
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:21,091
You just tell me, OK?

833
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:22,927
I don't want to go back.

834
01:22:24,054 --> 01:22:26,640
Well, I know, but just in case
you change your mind.

835
01:23:13,028 --> 01:23:15,489
I'm so used to calling her mom.

836
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,077
Ann?

837
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,704
Yeah.

838
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,212
She sounded so sad.

839
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:32,467
I know.

840
01:23:36,598 --> 01:23:39,059
What do you think mom will look like now?

841
01:23:43,898 --> 01:23:45,150
I don't know.

842
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:49,946
Do you remember her?

843
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:54,785
Not really.
Only from that little movie we saw.

844
01:24:04,505 --> 01:24:05,798
You look happy then.

845
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:08,260
Yeah.

846
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:16,561
You can keep that.

847
01:24:34,749 --> 01:24:35,708
Night.

848
01:25:17,592 --> 01:25:22,514
Dad, if a guy put a baby down,

849
01:25:22,514 --> 01:25:25,728
Traveled at the speed of light
for an hour,

850
01:25:26,312 --> 01:25:28,480
If he traveled at the speed of light,

851
01:25:28,814 --> 01:25:31,610
He would come back in an hour,

852
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:33,236
He would be an hour older,

853
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,489
But the little baby would be a very old man.

854
01:25:38,241 --> 01:25:39,535
Oh, yeah?

855
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,079
So, how long would it take him
to get to Huston?

856
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,795
Ah, if they were to travel...

857
01:25:48,504 --> 01:25:50,465
I would say about 3 seconds.

858
01:25:52,384 --> 01:25:55,012
Ah, over, I didn't get that last part.

859
01:25:56,764 --> 01:25:58,516
It would take them 3 seconds...

860
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,727
To get from California to Huston.

861
01:26:01,811 --> 01:26:03,521
At light speed.

862
01:26:12,157 --> 01:26:14,451
- This is Huston?
- Yup.

863
01:26:14,993 --> 01:26:17,955
How are we going to find her
in a big city like this?

864
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:20,626
- I know where she'll be.
- Where?

865
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:24,630
A bank. She's going to deposit
some money at a certain bank today.

866
01:26:28,176 --> 01:26:29,678
This is a bank?

867
01:26:30,428 --> 01:26:32,348
What kind of a bank is this?

868
01:26:33,015 --> 01:26:34,475
Looks like a drive in.

869
01:26:34,809 --> 01:26:37,061
I've never seen a bank like that.

870
01:26:38,062 --> 01:26:39,398
Me neither.

871
01:26:40,315 --> 01:26:43,402
There are so many cars...
We'll never find her.

872
01:26:43,735 --> 01:26:45,822
Oh, yeah, we will. Come on.

873
01:26:46,155 --> 01:26:49,033
We will split up and then
we will cover more ground. OK?

874
01:26:49,909 --> 01:26:52,080
Yeah, we could use the walky talkies.

875
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:54,291
Hey, now you're going.

876
01:26:54,624 --> 01:26:56,835
- I'll let you out here.
- OK.

877
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,846
Can you hear me dad? Over.

878
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,056
Loud and clear.

879
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:10,684
Good.

880
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:37,758
Hunter in position one. Over.

881
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:41,596
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

882
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:44,891
I told you it would be
more than a toy. Over.

883
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:47,102
Ten four. Over and out.

884
01:29:27,472 --> 01:29:29,891
Dad, she is just leaving the building.

885
01:29:30,266 --> 01:29:31,434
Get over here.

886
01:29:31,768 --> 01:29:34,606
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

887
01:29:39,402 --> 01:29:42,948
She's leaving the building.
Get over here!

888
01:29:43,866 --> 01:29:45,326
Dad!

889
01:29:45,743 --> 01:29:47,120
Come on!

890
01:29:47,621 --> 01:29:50,123
Dad! Wake up!

891
01:29:50,749 --> 01:29:53,670
Wake up! She is leaving the bank.

892
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:56,214
Dad! Wake up!

893
01:29:57,715 --> 01:30:00,344
Wh... Where is... duh...

894
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:02,721
I'm on my way.

895
01:30:03,555 --> 01:30:04,765
Oh, no.

896
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,207
She went that way!

897
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:28,502
Which way did she go?

898
01:30:28,877 --> 01:30:30,462
Hunter! Come on!

899
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:52,572
Hunter, did you really
get a good look at her, or what?

900
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,451
It was the right one,
I know it was her.

901
01:30:55,576 --> 01:30:57,619
Oh, god. We have lost her.

902
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:00,457
Can this piece of junk go faster?

903
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,627
There are 10 thousand cars here,
how are we going to find it?

904
01:31:04,753 --> 01:31:05,712
I don't know which one is it.

905
01:31:06,087 --> 01:31:07,631
Go faster dad, go faster.

906
01:31:07,965 --> 01:31:10,343
Hunter, what color...
the car was red, right?

907
01:31:10,676 --> 01:31:13,263
Yeah, a little red Chevy.

908
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,522
Do you see anything?
I don't know what it looks like.

909
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,941
You'll have to help me look,
can you see it?

910
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,818
No, not yet.

911
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:29,824
- I see it! I see it!
- Where, where?

912
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,869
Over in that lane, in that lane!

913
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:34,121
Which, which lane?

914
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:37,583
- The right one!
- Alright, settle down, I see it.

915
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,841
See if it's her. Can you tell?

916
01:31:46,594 --> 01:31:48,430
I can't tell.

917
01:31:48,722 --> 01:31:50,808
Wait a minute, there's two red cars now.

918
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,893
Which one is it?

919
01:31:54,354 --> 01:31:55,855
Ah, the right!
The left one!

920
01:31:56,314 --> 01:31:58,483
- You sure?
- Yeah, the left one.

921
01:32:05,157 --> 01:32:07,494
- You sure this is the one though.
- Yeah.

922
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:17,673
I hope you are right Hunter,
if we are following the wrong car,
we are going to wait a whole another month.

923
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:19,092
I'll be eight then.

924
01:32:19,509 --> 01:32:20,427
You'll be what?

925
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:22,430
I'll be eight then.

926
01:32:28,145 --> 01:32:30,313
Lets get closer, we can wave.

927
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,527
No, no... we don't want to get too close.
We might scare her,

928
01:32:34,527 --> 01:32:36,070
She'll have a wreck or something.

929
01:32:38,031 --> 01:32:40,742
- OK?
- OK. I guess so.

930
01:32:51,213 --> 01:32:54,718
Well, I wonder where she is going.

931
01:32:55,177 --> 01:32:57,429
Maybe to work.
What do you think?

932
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,931
Yeah, could be.

933
01:34:11,891 --> 01:34:13,643
Looks like a girls car to me.

934
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:15,855
Could it be hers?

935
01:34:18,149 --> 01:34:20,735
Could be... get in the truck
and I'll tell you my plan.

936
01:34:20,818 --> 01:34:21,611
OK.

937
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:33,625
Roll the windows up, lock the doors,
and if anybody talks to you,

938
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:37,464
Tell them your daddy’s inside
and he'll be right back. OK?

939
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:38,256
OK.

940
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,300
- You OK?
- Yap.

941
01:35:09,043 --> 01:35:13,589
Sergeant Jojo, call for you, booth 22.
Sergeant Jojo, booth 22.

942
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:16,635
Come in, no bets,
you guys are going to love this.

943
01:35:16,802 --> 01:35:19,096
The girls here spend so much time
with a guy that...

944
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:20,680
Most of them live alone.

945
01:35:20,847 --> 01:35:22,850
But it's tough to live alone in a city like this.

946
01:35:22,934 --> 01:35:24,477
A lot of violent things happen here.

947
01:35:25,103 --> 01:35:27,271
Stuff like rape, like murder,

948
01:35:27,522 --> 01:35:29,441
That's why we have a police force.

949
01:36:29,472 --> 01:36:30,556
Sir?

950
01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:34,310
Sir, you are in the wrong place.

951
01:36:36,521 --> 01:36:38,607
It's too early, all the girls are downstairs.

952
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,574
Please get a ride, cus I'm getting crazy.

953
01:38:42,836 --> 01:38:44,089
Yeah, who do you want?

954
01:38:44,422 --> 01:38:48,927
Yeah, I want to see a blond girl
with kinda short straight hair, about 25 years old.

955
01:38:49,887 --> 01:38:50,846
OK.

956
01:38:51,348 --> 01:38:53,558
She's coming down,
stay on the line.

957
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:13,582
Hello honey.

958
01:39:16,001 --> 01:39:17,421
Oh, mercy.

959
01:39:17,838 --> 01:39:21,842
You know, 23, I work 23
of the 24 bids in this place,

960
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,223
unless I make 24.

961
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,852
What can I do for you today?

962
01:39:31,938 --> 01:39:33,231
I have an idea.

963
01:39:33,982 --> 01:39:35,525
How about water polo?

964
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:38,821
Fun.

965
01:39:41,365 --> 01:39:42,825
Oh, well...

966
01:39:43,535 --> 01:39:44,661
Tell you what.

967
01:39:45,036 --> 01:39:47,706
Why don't you just tell nurse Piffs
what your pain is.

968
01:39:47,831 --> 01:39:49,207
Maybe I can find a cure... hmm?

969
01:39:49,499 --> 01:39:51,169
Well, why don't you look at me?

970
01:39:51,502 --> 01:39:53,045
I am looking at you.

971
01:39:53,337 --> 01:39:56,174
Yeah, but I'm over here,
can't you see me?

972
01:39:56,466 --> 01:39:59,721
Listen sweet heart, if I can see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

973
01:40:00,638 --> 01:40:02,724
Well, what do you see?

974
01:40:04,185 --> 01:40:07,146
See what you see.
Nurse Bibbs.

975
01:40:07,938 --> 01:40:09,982
Nurse Bibbs and a rubber horse.

976
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:13,737
Oh, oh, I see.

977
01:40:15,322 --> 01:40:17,408
Thank you Nurse Bibbs.

978
01:40:17,742 --> 01:40:19,035
Thank you.

979
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:30,493
Hi.

980
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:36,460
Are you out there?

981
01:41:38,755 --> 01:41:42,633
Well, I see your light's still on,
so you must be out there.

982
01:41:48,724 --> 01:41:50,434
It's OK if you don't want to talk,

983
01:41:50,517 --> 01:41:53,021
I don't want to talk either sometimes.

984
01:41:54,898 --> 01:41:56,858
I'd just like to stay silent.

985
01:42:03,699 --> 01:42:05,118
Do you mind if I sit down?

986
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,759
Do you mind if I sit down?

987
01:42:19,928 --> 01:42:20,970
No.

988
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,101
Thanks.

989
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:29,356
Legs get a little tired from standing all the time.

990
01:42:33,486 --> 01:42:35,321
Is this your first visit here?

991
01:42:36,614 --> 01:42:37,532
Yes.

992
01:42:41,204 --> 01:42:44,332
Well, this whole thing must seem
kinda strange to you, huh?

993
01:42:45,084 --> 01:42:48,170
You realize that I can't see you even
though you can see me.

994
01:42:49,046 --> 01:42:51,132
Well, that takes a little getting used to.

995
01:42:56,388 --> 01:42:58,391
Am I looking at your face now?

996
01:43:08,444 --> 01:43:10,112
It don't matter.

997
01:43:25,006 --> 01:43:27,425
If there is anything you want to talk about.

998
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:29,802
I'll just listen. Alright?

999
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,349
I'm a real good listener.

1000
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:48,325
Is there something...

1001
01:43:49,618 --> 01:43:51,871
Is there something I can do for you?

1002
01:44:01,632 --> 01:44:03,884
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

1003
01:44:06,721 --> 01:44:08,515
I'll just take off my sweater.

1004
01:44:08,765 --> 01:44:10,475
No, no. Don't.

1005
01:44:11,518 --> 01:44:13,687
Please, please leave it on.

1006
01:44:22,156 --> 01:44:23,241
I'm sorry.

1007
01:44:27,538 --> 01:44:30,541
I just don't know exactly
what it is you want.

1008
01:44:32,585 --> 01:44:34,420
I don't want anything.

1009
01:44:36,798 --> 01:44:38,843
So why did you come here then?

1010
01:44:48,854 --> 01:44:50,689
I want to talk to you.

1011
01:45:11,964 --> 01:45:14,009
Is there something you want to tell me?

1012
01:45:17,929 --> 01:45:18,931
No...

1013
01:45:24,313 --> 01:45:27,150
You can tell me, I can keep a secret.

1014
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:41,833
Is it all you do, just talk?

1015
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:47,548
Well, yeah.

1016
01:45:49,842 --> 01:45:51,302
Yeah, mostly.

1017
01:45:51,969 --> 01:45:53,431
And listen.

1018
01:45:58,062 --> 01:45:59,606
What else do you do?

1019
01:46:10,827 --> 01:46:12,328
Why are you laughing?

1020
01:46:12,704 --> 01:46:13,914
I'm sorry.

1021
01:46:18,585 --> 01:46:19,629
I'm sorry.

1022
01:46:21,297 --> 01:46:23,466
So, what else do you do?

1023
01:46:25,844 --> 01:46:27,638
Nothing, really.

1024
01:46:30,517 --> 01:46:33,437
Oh, well, we are not allowed
to see the customers out of here.

1025
01:46:35,773 --> 01:46:39,903
What if you see them,
do you go home with them?

1026
01:46:41,572 --> 01:46:43,240
No sir, we don't.

1027
01:46:46,119 --> 01:46:49,497
We're not allowed to have any outside
relationships with the customers.

1028
01:46:49,789 --> 01:46:52,500
Yeah, but you can really see them
if you want too, can't you.

1029
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:55,379
I mean you can go home with them,
if you want to, all these places say that.

1030
01:46:55,546 --> 01:46:59,383
I mean, how much extra money do you make?
How much money do you make on the side?

1031
01:47:12,232 --> 01:47:13,276
I'm sorry,

1032
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:16,196
Sir, I think you maybe want to talk
to one of the other girls.

1033
01:47:16,321 --> 01:47:18,656
I'll see if I can find one for you.

1034
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,659
No, no, no. No!

1035
01:47:21,327 --> 01:47:22,870
Please.

1036
01:47:25,122 --> 01:47:26,666
Please don't go.

1037
01:47:31,713 --> 01:47:34,675
I just don't think
I'm the one you want to talk to.

1038
01:47:37,054 --> 01:47:38,430
Please.

1039
01:47:39,849 --> 01:47:41,684
Please don't go, I'm sorry.

1040
01:47:51,403 --> 01:47:52,446
Alright.

1041
01:47:59,746 --> 01:48:00,790
I'm sorry.

1042
01:48:08,591 --> 01:48:09,676
That's OK.

1043
01:48:21,857 --> 01:48:25,151
I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers sometimes.

1044
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,243
Just relax.

1045
01:48:34,163 --> 01:48:36,290
Relax and tell me
what's on your mind.

1046
01:48:38,876 --> 01:48:40,253
I'll listen.

1047
01:48:42,798 --> 01:48:43,757
To you...

1048
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:51,474
I don't mind listening.

1049
01:48:59,901 --> 01:49:02,112
I do it all the time.

1050
01:49:23,805 --> 01:49:25,307
She was there, wasn't she?

1051
01:50:04,353 --> 01:50:05,729
What's that?

1052
01:50:11,987 --> 01:50:13,154
A vacant lot.

1053
01:50:14,031 --> 01:50:15,741
I bought that land
when we were all together,

1054
01:50:16,367 --> 01:50:17,618
With your mom.

1055
01:50:21,332 --> 01:50:24,210
Thought we might live there someday.

1056
01:50:26,546 --> 01:50:27,631
Where?

1057
01:50:28,549 --> 01:50:29,758
Paris.

1058
01:50:30,843 --> 01:50:31,844
Texas.

1059
01:50:32,177 --> 01:50:33,262
Where's that?

1060
01:50:34,931 --> 01:50:36,808
Across the red river.

1061
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:43,274
Do you like it?

1062
01:50:45,193 --> 01:50:46,736
Mean we live on dirt?

1063
01:51:02,297 --> 01:51:05,217
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks.

1064
01:51:07,219 --> 01:51:08,679
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1065
01:51:09,096 --> 01:51:10,473
To the truck.

1066
01:51:30,789 --> 01:51:32,123
Have another one?

1067
01:52:41,998 --> 01:52:45,044
This is not a place to bring a fancy woman.

1068
01:52:47,755 --> 01:52:52,219
Would you say, if you had a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

1069
01:52:52,844 --> 01:52:54,721
What's a fancy woman?

1070
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,039
My mother.

1071
01:53:18,833 --> 01:53:20,418
Not your mother.

1072
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:23,005
But my mother.

1073
01:53:23,673 --> 01:53:25,967
Was not a fancy woman.

1074
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:27,760
She was...

1075
01:53:34,059 --> 01:53:38,315
She never wanted to be a fancy woman.
She never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

1076
01:53:39,316 --> 01:53:40,776
Then what was she?

1077
01:53:41,694 --> 01:53:43,738
She was just plain.

1078
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,034
Just plain, good.

1079
01:53:49,287 --> 01:53:51,163
She was very good.

1080
01:53:51,789 --> 01:53:52,999
But my daddy...

1081
01:53:56,003 --> 01:53:58,005
See, my daddy had...

1082
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:00,674
He had this idea...

1083
01:54:01,008 --> 01:54:04,888
He had this idea that was kind of...

1084
01:54:06,014 --> 01:54:07,724
Kind of a sickness...

1085
01:54:09,311 --> 01:54:10,270
What idea?

1086
01:54:11,104 --> 01:54:13,189
He had this idea about her.

1087
01:54:17,069 --> 01:54:18,613
He looked at her...

1088
01:54:20,114 --> 01:54:21,908
But he didn't see her.

1089
01:54:25,245 --> 01:54:26,163
He...

1090
01:54:26,788 --> 01:54:28,624
He saw this idea.

1091
01:54:32,253 --> 01:54:36,634
And he told people
that she was from Paris.

1092
01:54:38,677 --> 01:54:40,304
A big joke.

1093
01:54:40,638 --> 01:54:42,433
He started telling everybody all the time,

1094
01:54:42,808 --> 01:54:44,894
Finally it wasn't a joke anymore.

1095
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:49,775
He started believing it.

1096
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:52,945
And...

1097
01:54:53,487 --> 01:54:55,155
He actually believed...

1098
01:54:58,076 --> 01:54:59,285
She...

1099
01:55:00,203 --> 01:55:01,496
Oh, God.

1100
01:55:02,665 --> 01:55:04,792
She would get so embarrassed.

1101
01:55:07,294 --> 01:55:08,337
She'd...

1102
01:55:09,506 --> 01:55:10,966
She was so...

1103
01:55:13,803 --> 01:55:15,763
She was so shy...

1104
01:56:04,821 --> 01:56:06,406
Lominos, cha, cha.

1105
01:56:35,566 --> 01:56:36,777
Left, dad.

1106
01:56:52,671 --> 01:56:54,547
Hunter, it's me.

1107
01:56:57,677 --> 01:57:00,888
I was afraid I'd never be able to say
the right words to you,

1108
01:57:01,264 --> 01:57:02,807
In person.

1109
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:07,396
So, I'm trying to do it like this.

1110
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:13,569
When I first saw you, this time

1111
01:57:14,737 --> 01:57:16,030
at Walts...

1112
01:57:18,075 --> 01:57:20,911
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

1113
01:57:23,415 --> 01:57:26,627
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1114
01:57:29,255 --> 01:57:31,133
You showed me I was.

1115
01:57:34,886 --> 01:57:37,140
But the biggest thing I hoped for...

1116
01:57:40,059 --> 01:57:41,686
Can't come true.

1117
01:57:44,356 --> 01:57:45,941
I know that now.

1118
01:57:48,819 --> 01:57:50,655
You belong together with your mother.

1119
01:57:53,283 --> 01:57:55,577
You belong together with your mother.

1120
01:57:57,789 --> 01:58:00,167
It was me that tore you apart.

1121
01:58:00,834 --> 01:58:03,963
And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.

1122
01:58:06,132 --> 01:58:08,009
But I can't stay with you.

1123
01:58:08,468 --> 01:58:10,638
I could never heal up what happened.

1124
01:58:11,847 --> 01:58:14,266
It's just the way it is.

1125
01:58:15,851 --> 01:58:18,647
I can't even hardly remember what happened...

1126
01:58:19,356 --> 01:58:20,774
It's like a gap.

1127
01:58:21,691 --> 01:58:24,362
It left me alone in a way that...

1128
01:58:24,737 --> 01:58:26,364
I haven't gotten over.

1129
01:58:27,198 --> 01:58:28,658
And right now...

1130
01:58:29,116 --> 01:58:30,201
I'm afraid.

1131
01:58:32,330 --> 01:58:35,124
I'm afraid of walking away again.

1132
01:58:35,416 --> 01:58:37,795
I'm afraid of what I might find.

1133
01:58:39,588 --> 01:58:41,632
But I'm even more afraid of...

1134
01:58:42,424 --> 01:58:44,552
Not facing this fear.

1135
01:58:45,595 --> 01:58:47,305
I love you Hunter.

1136
01:58:49,307 --> 01:58:51,644
I love you more than my life.

1137
01:59:03,116 --> 01:59:05,703
- Hey.
- Hey.

1138
01:59:11,626 --> 01:59:13,253
Can I tell you something?

1139
01:59:16,006 --> 01:59:18,384
Sure... Anything you like.

1140
01:59:20,177 --> 01:59:21,554
It's kind of long.

1141
01:59:23,306 --> 01:59:24,933
I have plenty of time.

1142
01:59:48,879 --> 01:59:50,505
I knew these people...

1143
01:59:51,299 --> 01:59:52,383
What people?

1144
01:59:54,427 --> 01:59:55,887
These two people...

1145
02:00:01,685 --> 02:00:03,395
They were in love with each other...

1146
02:00:06,733 --> 02:00:08,151
The girl was...

1147
02:00:08,736 --> 02:00:13,075
Very young, about 17, or 18...
I guess.

1148
02:00:14,493 --> 02:00:15,994
And the guy was...

1149
02:00:16,578 --> 02:00:17,956
Quite a bit older.

1150
02:00:19,582 --> 02:00:22,377
And he was kind of raggedy and wild.

1151
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,798
And she was very beautiful, you know?

1152
02:00:28,592 --> 02:00:29,426
Yeah.

1153
02:00:30,219 --> 02:00:34,182
And together they turned everything
into a kind of an adventure.

1154
02:00:35,642 --> 02:00:37,102
And she liked that.

1155
02:00:38,646 --> 02:00:41,984
Just an ordinary trip
down to the grocery store was...

1156
02:00:42,567 --> 02:00:44,152
Full of adventure.

1157
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:49,033
And they were always laughing
at stupid things...

1158
02:00:49,409 --> 02:00:51,245
He liked to make her laugh.

1159
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:53,872
And...

1160
02:00:56,083 --> 02:00:58,461
They didn't much care for anything else.

1161
02:00:59,254 --> 02:01:02,674
Cus all they wanted to do
was be with each other.

1162
02:01:04,593 --> 02:01:06,429
They were always together.

1163
02:01:07,221 --> 02:01:09,432
Sounds like they were very happy.

1164
02:01:11,435 --> 02:01:14,314
Yes. They were, they were real happy.

1165
02:01:15,898 --> 02:01:16,941
And he...

1166
02:01:17,483 --> 02:01:19,194
Hey loved her more than...

1167
02:01:21,613 --> 02:01:23,490
He ever felt possible.

1168
02:01:26,828 --> 02:01:29,205
He couldn't stand being away from her,

1169
02:01:29,289 --> 02:01:31,542
During the day
when he went to work.

1170
02:01:36,756 --> 02:01:38,258
So he quit.

1171
02:01:39,926 --> 02:01:41,678
Just to be home with her.

1172
02:01:42,554 --> 02:01:45,099
And then he'd get another job
when the money ran out...

1173
02:01:46,852 --> 02:01:48,687
And then he'd quit again.

1174
02:01:49,355 --> 02:01:52,317
But pretty soon, she started to worry.

1175
02:01:56,738 --> 02:01:58,824
- Bout what?
- Money I guess.

1176
02:01:59,575 --> 02:02:00,951
Not having enough.

1177
02:02:01,285 --> 02:02:03,579
Not knowing when the next check
was coming in.

1178
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:08,335
Yeap, I know that feeling.

1179
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,463
So, he started to get kinda...

1180
02:02:11,839 --> 02:02:13,299
Torn inside.

1181
02:02:17,303 --> 02:02:18,514
How do you mean?

1182
02:02:19,975 --> 02:02:22,143
Well, he knew he had to work
to support her...

1183
02:02:23,144 --> 02:02:25,564
But he couldn't stand
being away from her either.

1184
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,193
I see.

1185
02:02:29,735 --> 02:02:32,864
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

1186
02:02:34,324 --> 02:02:37,077
Except now, he got really crazy.

1187
02:02:40,832 --> 02:02:42,959
He started imagining all kinds of things.

1188
02:02:45,212 --> 02:02:46,171
Like what?

1189
02:02:48,716 --> 02:02:52,220
He started thinking
she was seeing other men on the sly.

1190
02:02:54,223 --> 02:02:56,601
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of...

1191
02:02:57,060 --> 02:02:59,397
Spending the day
with somebody else.

1192
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:02,275
He'd yell at her
and break things in the trailer.

1193
02:03:05,404 --> 02:03:06,447
The trailer...

1194
02:03:11,994 --> 02:03:13,079
Yes.

1195
02:03:14,581 --> 02:03:16,416
They lived in a trailer home.

1196
02:03:31,934 --> 02:03:34,772
Excuse me sir, but were you
in this with me the other day?

1197
02:03:36,273 --> 02:03:37,649
I don't mean to pry...

1198
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:40,945
No.

1199
02:03:42,739 --> 02:03:43,657
Oh...

1200
02:03:47,745 --> 02:03:50,039
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

1201
02:03:51,457 --> 02:03:52,376
No.

1202
02:03:53,335 --> 02:03:54,836
Wasn't me.

1203
02:03:55,504 --> 02:03:56,588
Uh huh...

1204
02:03:59,802 --> 02:04:00,928
Please go on.

1205
02:04:04,181 --> 02:04:07,477
Anyway... He started
to drink real bad.

1206
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:11,189
He would stay out late to test her.

1207
02:04:13,567 --> 02:04:15,403
What do you mean, test her?

1208
02:04:16,487 --> 02:04:18,322
To see if she would get jealous.

1209
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,285
Ha... uh huh.

1210
02:04:24,746 --> 02:04:28,167
He wanted her to get jealous.
But she didn't.

1211
02:04:28,584 --> 02:04:30,086
She just worried about him,

1212
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:32,924
But that got him even madder.

1213
02:04:34,718 --> 02:04:35,885
Why?

1214
02:04:37,345 --> 02:04:38,888
Because...

1215
02:04:40,141 --> 02:04:42,977
He thought that if she never got jealous of him
she didn't really care about him.

1216
02:04:44,812 --> 02:04:48,275
Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.

1217
02:04:49,234 --> 02:04:50,902
And then one night,

1218
02:04:51,945 --> 02:04:55,116
One night she told him
that she was pregnant.

1219
02:04:56,034 --> 02:04:58,619
She was about 3 or 4 months pregnant.

1220
02:04:58,995 --> 02:05:00,706
And he didn't even know.

1221
02:05:01,415 --> 02:05:03,626
And then suddenly everything would change.

1222
02:05:04,711 --> 02:05:07,798
He stopped drinking,
and got a steady job.

1223
02:05:08,674 --> 02:05:10,634
He was convinced
that she loved him now,

1224
02:05:10,718 --> 02:05:12,888
Because she was carrying his child.

1225
02:05:13,847 --> 02:05:17,601
And he was going to dedicate himself
to making a home for her.

1226
02:05:18,852 --> 02:05:20,938
But a funny thing started to happen.

1227
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:22,690
What?

1228
02:05:23,274 --> 02:05:25,568
He didn't even notice it at first.

1229
02:05:25,943 --> 02:05:27,905
She started to change.

1230
02:05:28,697 --> 02:05:30,240
From the day the baby was born.

1231
02:05:30,366 --> 02:05:32,994
She began to get irritated
with everything around her.

1232
02:05:33,536 --> 02:05:35,246
She got mad at everything.

1233
02:05:36,499 --> 02:05:39,502
Even the baby seemed
to be injustice to her.

1234
02:05:40,087 --> 02:05:42,714
He kept trying to make everything
alright for her,

1235
02:05:43,006 --> 02:05:44,466
Buy her things,

1236
02:05:44,466 --> 02:05:46,803
Take her out to dinner once a week.

1237
02:05:47,512 --> 02:05:49,555
But nothing seemed to satisfy her.

1238
02:05:50,348 --> 02:05:53,811
For two years, he struggled
to pull them back together,

1239
02:05:53,894 --> 02:05:56,271
Like the were when they first met.

1240
02:05:57,523 --> 02:06:01,361
But finally he knew
that it was never going to work out.

1241
02:06:03,488 --> 02:06:05,281
So he hit the bottle again.

1242
02:06:05,657 --> 02:06:07,868
But this time it got mean.

1243
02:06:08,954 --> 02:06:11,123
This time when he came home
late at night,

1244
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:14,168
She wasn't worried about him,
or jealous.

1245
02:06:14,919 --> 02:06:17,088
She was just enraged.

1246
02:06:18,631 --> 02:06:20,968
She accused him of holding her captive.

1247
02:06:21,302 --> 02:06:23,138
By making her have a baby.

1248
02:06:25,181 --> 02:06:27,476
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

1249
02:06:28,185 --> 02:06:30,938
That was all she dreamed about... Escape.

1250
02:06:32,148 --> 02:06:35,402
She saw herself at night,
running naked down a highway.

1251
02:06:36,069 --> 02:06:37,946
Running across fields.

1252
02:06:38,321 --> 02:06:39,991
Running down river beds.

1253
02:06:40,408 --> 02:06:41,660
Always running.

1254
02:06:42,119 --> 02:06:44,580
And always when she was
just about to get away...

1255
02:06:44,955 --> 02:06:46,248
He would be there.

1256
02:06:46,833 --> 02:06:48,501
He would stop her somehow.

1257
02:06:50,253 --> 02:06:52,172
He would just appear and stop her.

1258
02:06:55,634 --> 02:06:59,263
And when she told him these dreams,
He believed them.

1259
02:07:00,223 --> 02:07:01,641
He knew she had to be stopped,

1260
02:07:01,808 --> 02:07:03,435
Or she would leave him forever.

1261
02:07:04,352 --> 02:07:06,646
So he tied a cow bell to her ankle,

1262
02:07:06,981 --> 02:07:09,942
So he could hear at night
if she tried to get out of bed.

1263
02:07:11,069 --> 02:07:14,783
But she learned how to muffle the bell,
by stuffing a sock into it.

1264
02:07:15,116 --> 02:07:17,577
And inching her way
out of the bed...

1265
02:07:18,161 --> 02:07:19,662
And into the night.

1266
02:07:21,248 --> 02:07:23,125
He caught her one night
when the sock fell out

1267
02:07:23,292 --> 02:07:25,628
And he heard her
trying to run to the high way.

1268
02:07:25,795 --> 02:07:30,008
He caught her, dragged her
back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,

1269
02:07:30,133 --> 02:07:31,676
With his belt.

1270
02:07:33,595 --> 02:07:34,931
He just left her there.

1271
02:07:35,515 --> 02:07:36,974
And went back to bed.

1272
02:07:38,434 --> 02:07:40,479
And lay there listing to her scream.

1273
02:07:42,189 --> 02:07:44,400
Then he'd listen to his son's scream.

1274
02:07:46,610 --> 02:07:51,117
And he was surprised at himself
because he didn't feel anything anymore.

1275
02:07:53,577 --> 02:07:56,289
All he wanted to do was sleep.

1276
02:07:58,583 --> 02:08:02,588
And for the first time,
he wished he were far away.

1277
02:08:06,551 --> 02:08:10,222
Lost in a deep vast country
where nobody knew him.

1278
02:08:11,473 --> 02:08:13,183
Somewhere without language.

1279
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:15,645
Or streets.

1280
02:08:17,105 --> 02:08:19,900
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing it's name.

1281
02:08:21,194 --> 02:08:22,571
And when he woke up,

1282
02:08:23,071 --> 02:08:24,489
He was on fire.

1283
02:08:27,452 --> 02:08:30,455
There were blue flames
among the sheets of his bed.

1284
02:08:31,539 --> 02:08:33,374
He ran through the flames,

1285
02:08:34,376 --> 02:08:36,462
Toward the only two people he loved.

1286
02:08:38,005 --> 02:08:39,381
But they were gone.

1287
02:08:42,635 --> 02:08:43,970
His arms were burning.

1288
02:08:44,262 --> 02:08:46,181
And he threw himself outside...

1289
02:08:48,225 --> 02:08:50,061
And rolled on the wet ground.

1290
02:08:53,106 --> 02:08:54,442
Then he ran.

1291
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,446
He never looked back at the fire.

1292
02:09:01,408 --> 02:09:02,743
He just ran.

1293
02:09:09,501 --> 02:09:11,544
He ran until the sun came up.

1294
02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:15,341
And he couldn't run any further.

1295
02:09:17,676 --> 02:09:19,428
And when the sun went down...

1296
02:09:20,221 --> 02:09:21,890
He ran again.

1297
02:09:28,148 --> 02:09:30,484
For five days he ran like this.

1298
02:09:32,653 --> 02:09:34,697
Until every sign of man...

1299
02:09:37,742 --> 02:09:39,244
Has disappeared.

1300
02:09:50,675 --> 02:09:52,009
Travis.

1301
02:10:35,228 --> 02:10:36,897
If you turn the light off in there,

1302
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:38,732
Would you be able to see me?

1303
02:10:46,866 --> 02:10:47,950
I don't know.

1304
02:10:53,332 --> 02:10:54,750
I never tried.

1305
02:11:13,981 --> 02:11:15,192
Can you see me?

1306
02:11:17,861 --> 02:11:19,154
Yeah.

1307
02:11:20,614 --> 02:11:22,033
Do you recognize me?

1308
02:11:24,994 --> 02:11:26,538
Oh, Travis.

1309
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:36,174
I brought Hunter with me.

1310
02:11:48,773 --> 02:11:50,108
Don't you want to see him?

1311
02:11:53,278 --> 02:11:54,320
Yeah.

1312
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:08,086
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1313
02:12:14,344 --> 02:12:16,848
Ann kept sending me pictures of him.

1314
02:12:20,143 --> 02:12:22,104
Until I asked her to stop.

1315
02:12:28,904 --> 02:12:30,322
I couldn't stand...

1316
02:12:31,573 --> 02:12:34,659
The pain of seeing him
grow up and missing it.

1317
02:12:43,922 --> 02:12:46,549
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

1318
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:51,514
I couldn't, Travis.

1319
02:12:56,186 --> 02:12:58,772
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

1320
02:13:05,822 --> 02:13:09,243
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

1321
02:13:14,959 --> 02:13:16,711
Well he needs you now, Jane.

1322
02:13:17,587 --> 02:13:19,047
And he wants to see you.

1323
02:13:19,464 --> 02:13:20,424
He does?

1324
02:13:23,845 --> 02:13:24,762
Yes.

1325
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:32,020
He's waiting for you...

1326
02:13:32,563 --> 02:13:33,522
Where?

1327
02:13:36,901 --> 02:13:38,069
Downtown.

1328
02:13:39,529 --> 02:13:40,738
In a hotel.

1329
02:13:43,367 --> 02:13:44,535
The Meridian.

1330
02:13:47,204 --> 02:13:49,207
Room 1520.

1331
02:13:57,009 --> 02:13:58,760
You're not going, are you?

1332
02:14:14,612 --> 02:14:16,448
I can't see you Jane.

1333
02:14:18,992 --> 02:14:20,411
Don't go yet.

1334
02:14:25,375 --> 02:14:26,710
Don't go yet.

1335
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:47,150
I...

1336
02:14:49,737 --> 02:14:53,200
I used to make up long speeches
to you after you left.

1337
02:14:58,414 --> 02:15:00,583
I used to talk to you all the time.

1338
02:15:01,209 --> 02:15:02,752
Even though I was alone.

1339
02:15:06,841 --> 02:15:09,426
I walked around for months
talking to you.

1340
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:17,186
Now, I don't know what to say.

1341
02:15:21,524 --> 02:15:24,403
It was easier when I just imagined you.

1342
02:15:32,538 --> 02:15:35,082
I even imagined you
talking back to me.

1343
02:15:40,088 --> 02:15:42,466
We'd have long conversations.

1344
02:15:44,469 --> 02:15:46,012
The two of us.

1345
02:15:50,017 --> 02:15:52,603
It was almost like you were there.

1346
02:15:56,983 --> 02:15:58,486
I would hear you.

1347
02:15:58,986 --> 02:16:00,696
I would see you, smell you.

1348
02:16:03,073 --> 02:16:04,701
I could hear your voice.

1349
02:16:08,121 --> 02:16:10,416
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

1350
02:16:14,045 --> 02:16:17,841
It would wake me up in the middle of the night
just like you were there in the room with me.

1351
02:16:26,518 --> 02:16:27,477
Then...

1352
02:16:31,191 --> 02:16:33,235
It slowly faded.

1353
02:16:35,363 --> 02:16:37,407
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1354
02:16:41,578 --> 02:16:44,916
I tried to talk out loud to you
like I used to,

1355
02:16:44,916 --> 02:16:46,709
But there was no one there.

1356
02:16:50,631 --> 02:16:52,550
I couldn't hear you.

1357
02:16:58,348 --> 02:16:59,474
Then...

1358
02:17:05,232 --> 02:17:06,608
I just gave up.

1359
02:17:13,658 --> 02:17:15,285
Everything stopped.

1360
02:17:17,496 --> 02:17:18,539
You.

1361
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:24,754
Just disappeared.

1362
02:17:31,554 --> 02:17:33,514
Now I'm working here.

1363
02:17:39,314 --> 02:17:41,524
I hear your voice all the time.

1364
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:49,325
Every man...

1365
02:17:50,367 --> 02:17:51,995
Has your voice.

1366
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:13,062
I'll tell Hunter...

1367
02:18:14,104 --> 02:18:15,439
That you are coming.

1368
02:18:19,945 --> 02:18:21,655
- Travis.
- What?

1369
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,495
I'll be there.

1370
02:18:33,001 --> 02:18:33,877
Good.

1371
02:18:39,801 --> 02:18:42,346
- Meridian hotel...
- Yeah.

1372
02:18:47,185 --> 02:18:48,395
Room...

1373
02:20:02,816 --> 02:20:04,109
Oh, you little...

1374
02:21:40,432 --> 02:21:41,642
Your hair.

1375
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:43,352
It's wet...
