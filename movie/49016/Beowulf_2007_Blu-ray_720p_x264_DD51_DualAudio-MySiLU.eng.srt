1
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:36,626
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

2
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,123
I want mead!

3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,632
Give me some mead, my Queen!

4
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:52,076
Thank you, my beautiful Queen.

5
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,247
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

6
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,820
This is how it works, Aesher.

7
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,554
After you die,
you wouldn't really be dead

8
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:14,531
providing you have accepted him
as the one and only God.

9
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,013
All right, back! Back!

10
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,131
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

11
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,071
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!
I want a kiss!

12
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,302
Please, stop it!

13
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,408
More!

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,386
My thanes, my beautiful thanes!

15
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,720
One year ago, I, Hrothgar, your King

16
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,658
swore that we would
celebrate our victories

17
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,289
in a new hall, mighty and beautiful!

18
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,457
Have I not kept my oath? Yeah.

19
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,735
In this hall, we shall divide
the spoils of our conquests,

20
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,139
the gold and the treasure.

21
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:36,375
And this shall be a place of merriment,
joy, and fornication!

22
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,050
From now until the end of time,
I name this hall Herot!

23
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,962
Treasure!
Let's hand out some treasure!

24
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,991
Give me some of that!

25
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,729
From my conquests!

26
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,302
Unferth!

27
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:07,039
For Unferth, for Unferth,
my wisest advisor,

28
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:13,381
violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

29
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:18,321
Unferth, where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

30
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,722
I'm here, my King.

31
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:25,328
Unferth, come here, you ungrateful lout!

32
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:43,145
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

33
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,242
He faced a demon dragon
When other men would freeze

34
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,255
And then, my lords, he took his sword
And brought it to its knees...

35
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,154
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

36
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,819
The greatest of our kings

37
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,655
He broke the dragon's wings

38
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,391
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

39
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,334
The kingdom fell in darkness
And shadows ruled the night

40
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,376
With no sign of dawn, he soldiered on
And brought us back to life

41
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,274
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

42
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,244
He never shook your faith

43
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,077
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

44
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,811
Let every cup be raised

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,118
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

46
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,293
He offered us protection
When monsters roamed the land

47
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,525
And one by one, he took them on
They perished at his hand

48
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,494
Mead!

49
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,903
Mead!

50
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,238
Mead!

51
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,174
You're spilling it. Where's my mead?
You're spilling it.

52
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,040
You're spilling it!

53
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,073
Cain, you clumsy idiot!

54
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,776
How dare you waste the King's mead?

55
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,362
He rose up like a savior
When every hope was gone

56
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,433
The beast was gored
and peace restored

57
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,399
His memory will live on

58
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,129
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

59
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,330
Let every cup be raised

60
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,067
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

61
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,905
Now and forever

62
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,721
A sword! Give me a sword!

63
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,904
Come! Arm yourselves!

64
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,838
Stay down, my Lady!

65
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,719
- Give me a sword! A sword!
- My Lord!

66
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,734
No!

67
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,936
Fight me!

68
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,740
Fight me!

69
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,281
Fight me.

70
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,396
You fight me, damn you.

71
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,659
Nay.

72
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,210
What was that?

73
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,777
Grendel.

74
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,957
Grendel, what have you done?

75
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,398
What hafast flu done, Grendel?

76
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,843
Fish and wolf and bear

77
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,939
and sheep or two,

78
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,245
ac nan men.

79
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,794
Men, Grendel.

80
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,965
They have slain so many of our kind.

81
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,964
Was Hrothgar there?

82
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,184
Good.

83
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,117
Good boy.

84
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,020
And tender.

85
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,467
Men, build another pyre!

86
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,042
There's dry wood behind the stables.

87
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,168
Then burn the dead.

88
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,874
And seal the hall!
Close the doors and the windows.

89
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,644
And by the King's order,

90
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,187
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

91
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,381
This place reeks of death.

92
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,021
The scops are singing
the shame of Herot

93
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,862
as far south as the middle kingdom
and as far north as the ice-lands.

94
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,198
I've let it be known that
I will give half the gold in my kingdom

95
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,795
to any man who can rid us of Grendel.

96
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,568
My King, for deliverance

97
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:14,305
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

98
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,472
With your permission,

99
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:21,019
shall we also pray
to the new Roman god, Christ Jesus?

100
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,987
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

101
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,954
No, Unferth, no.

102
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,521
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

103
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,223
What we need is a hero.

104
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,636
Hold your oars up!

105
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,869
And heave!

106
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,975
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

107
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,250
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

108
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,383
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

109
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,291
We're lost! Given to the sea!

110
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,954
The sea's my mother!

111
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,034
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

112
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,112
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

113
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,774
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

114
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,785
Heave!

115
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,557
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

116
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,718
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

117
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,197
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out

118
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,962
if we really want in!

119
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,034
Who wants to live?

120
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,631
We do!

121
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,406
Then pull your oars! Let's see you do it!

122
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,413
For Beowulf!

123
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,380
For gold!

124
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,781
For glory!

125
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,603
Heave! Heave!

126
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,210
Heave! Heave!

127
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,989
Beowulf.

128
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,526
Hold fast!

129
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,397
No.

130
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,373
Who are you?
From your dress, you are warriors.

131
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,976
Speak! Why should I
not run you through right now?

132
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,522
We are Geats.

133
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,251
I am Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow.

134
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,720
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar
in friendship.

135
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,858
They say you have a monster here?

136
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,334
They say your lands are cursed.

137
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,426
Is that what they say?

138
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,301
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame

139
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,932
from the frozen North
to the shores of Vinland.

140
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,806
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

141
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,211
I am Beowulf!
And I am here to kill your monster.

142
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,610
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough

143
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,155
to come around here
and die for our gold.

144
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,193
If we die, it'll be for glory, not for gold.

145
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,437
My Lord?

146
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,910
My Lord?
There are warriors outside. Geats.

147
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,378
But they are no beggars,

148
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,039
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

149
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,448
Beowulf? Ecgtheow's little boy?

150
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,214
Beowulf. Where is he? Where?

151
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,017
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome, my boy.

152
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,358
Welcome. Yes. How's your father?

153
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,861
Dead.

154
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,989
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

155
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, he was a brave man.

156
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,935
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

157
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,268
I've come to kill your monster.

158
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,805
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

159
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:44,281
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead

160
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:50,688
and many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

161
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:55,454
But in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them

162
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,257
but blood to be cleaned from the floor

163
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,899
and the benches, and the walls.

164
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,475
I have drunk nothing, yet.

165
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,010
But I will kill your monster.

166
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:21,142
He will kill the monster.
Did you hear that? Grendel will die.

167
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,313
- Grendel?
- Yeah, the monster is called Grendel.

168
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,592
Then I will kill your Grendel.

169
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,892
I, Beowulf,
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

170
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,161
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

171
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:41,205
and this troll of yours
will trouble you no more.

172
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,003
A hero! A hero!
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

173
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,477
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

174
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,411
and kill the monster in its den?

175
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:55,543
I have 14 brave thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

176
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:02,720
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead

177
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,591
famed across the world

178
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:09,258
and to feast
in your legendary mead hall.

179
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,997
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

180
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,939
Merrymaking in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

181
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,211
Well, then.

182
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,977
Open the mead hall! Let's drink!

183
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,957
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

184
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:15,296
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

185
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,868
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

186
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:22,406
Five days? In the name of Odin,
no wonder my loins are burning!

187
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,011
Beowulf, there you are.

188
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,050
I was thinking about your father.
Great man.

189
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,448
He was fleeing the Wulfings

190
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,044
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

191
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,056
- Heatholaf.
- That's it, yeah. That's right.

192
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:44,925
I paid the blood debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

193
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,057
So I saved his skin,
and you're here to save ours, that right?

194
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,874
All hail the great Beowulf,

195
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:04,642
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

196
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,785
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

197
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:16,794
But can I ask a question,
as a huge admirer of yours?

198
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,403
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of

199
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:32,443
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

200
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,644
Was that you?

201
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,908
I swam against Brecca.

202
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:47,186
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

203
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,159
someone else of the same name.

204
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,631
Because, you see,
the Beowulf I heard of

205
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,362
swam against Brecca and lost.

206
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:03,267
He risked his life and Brecca's

207
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,776
to serve his own vanity and pride.

208
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,346
A boastful fool.

209
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,312
And he lost!

210
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,248
So I thought it had to be someone else.

211
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,060
I swam against Brecca.

212
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:28,126
But victory was his, not yours.

213
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:33,330
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

214
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,136
Speaking only for myself here,

215
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,008
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment

216
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,706
against Grendel,

217
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:50,015
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

218
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,753
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

219
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,962
But it's true, I did not win the race.

220
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:10,405
We swam for five days, neck and neck.

221
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,502
I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch

222
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,582
when this storm blew up

223
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,443
and with it came sea monsters.

224
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,067
Again and again, the monsters attacked!

225
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,731
Dark things from the sea's depths.

226
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:56,112
I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,

227
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,781
spilling their guts into the sea.

228
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:12,892
Beowulf!

229
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:25,377
Then one of them seized me by its jaws

230
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,282
and dragged me to the bottom.

231
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:02,252
I killed the monster with my own blade

232
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,649
and I plunged it into its heart.

233
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,996
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

234
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,462
And you killed, what was it? 20?

235
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,903
Nine.

236
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,372
Last time it were three.

237
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,308
But would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

238
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:33,074
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

239
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,550
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

240
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,315
I know who you are.

241
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,122
They say you killed both your brothers

242
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:50,065
when you witnessed them
having knowledge of your mother.

243
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,602
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

244
00:27:55,707 --> 00:28:00,167
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

245
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,543
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

246
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,912
without fear of retaliation.

247
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,349
Tonight will be different!

248
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:13,322
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting
for him, not frightened sheep

249
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,856
like you.

250
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,469
Well done!

251
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:34,504
That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

252
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,638
So you will kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

253
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,785
Well, let's all drink in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

254
00:28:55,967 --> 00:29:00,063
Lips ripe as the berries in June

255
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:04,164
Red the rose, red the rose

256
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:08,541
Skin pale as the light of the moon

257
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,207
Gently as she goes

258
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,678
Eyes blue as the sea and the sky

259
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,186
Beowulf. Come.

260
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,256
Water flows, water flows

261
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,325
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

262
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,522
Heart burning like fire in the night

263
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,191
Gently as she goes

264
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,231
Come.

265
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,071
There.

266
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,005
The Royal Dragon Horn.

267
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,079
It is beautiful.

268
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,179
Isn't it magnificent?

269
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,656
She's the prize of my treasure.

270
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,719
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,
the dragon of the Northern moors.

271
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,924
Nearly cost me my life.

272
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,329
And there's a soft spot
under the throat, there.

273
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,896
See? You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

274
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,575
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

275
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,910
I wonder how many men
have died for love of her beauty.

276
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,885
Can you blame them?

277
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,461
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

278
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:36,490
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

279
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,970
You do me great honor.

280
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,708
It is we who are honored.

281
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,029
Is that your demon?

282
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,828
That was a wolf.
You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

283
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,870
No? Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

284
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,999
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

285
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,576
to ecstasy and back.

286
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,544
No other man
will ever be able to satisfy you again.

287
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,308
- Sorry.
- Come on!

288
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,849
- I said no and I meant no.
- Why not?

289
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,285
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

290
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,085
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

291
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,590
The hour is upon us.

292
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,828
This old man needs his sleep.

293
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,439
Where's my beautiful bedmate?
Come, my love.

294
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,444
In a moment.

295
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,545
Come, Wealthow,
let us pound the pillows.

296
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,285
Don't touch me!

297
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:00,910
Don't touch me!

298
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,913
That's the spirit, my girl.

299
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,020
My Lord!

300
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:16,730
Perhaps Her Majesty
could grace our ears

301
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:21,430
with one more melody
before we all retire?

302
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,745
It's the least I can do.

303
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:40,517
Beowulf, I'll hope to see you
in the morning, Odin willing.

304
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,487
And make sure
your thanes secure the doors.

305
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,499
Good night. Good night.

306
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,896
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea monsters.

307
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,773
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

308
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,244
Just wait

309
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,256
Though wide he may roam

310
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:18,853
Always a hero comes home

311
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:28,299
He goes where no one has gone

312
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:33,275
But always a hero comes home

313
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:58,959
He goes where no one has gone

314
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:05,566
But always a hero comes home

315
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,251
That was beautiful.

316
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,699
You need to go now, Your Majesty.

317
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,537
Of course. Grendel.

318
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,544
The demon is my husband's shame.

319
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,276
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

320
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,845
No, shame.

321
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,352
My husband has no other. No sons.

322
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,185
And he will have no more,
for all his talk.

323
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,355
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?

324
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,296
Nah. Not my type.

325
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,231
I know your type.

326
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,710
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

327
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,773
The creature has no sword, no armor.

328
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,319
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

329
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,684
We shall fight as equals.

330
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,780
And fate

331
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,621
shall decide.

332
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,907
Good. Tie it off with more chain.

333
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,622
Enough frican' about!

334
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,697
You're mad, you know that?

335
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,167
Yes.

336
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,702
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

337
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,449
I don't like the smell of this one,
my Lord.

338
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,654
The men are unprepared.

339
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,013
They're distracted.

340
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,192
Too many untended women here!

341
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,058
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

342
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,394
A warrior's mind must be unblurred,
my Lord.

343
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,266
Good night, Wiglaf.

344
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,534
And while you're sleeping,
what're we meant to do?

345
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,238
Sing! Loudly!

346
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,312
Well, you heard him.
He wants us to sing. So sing!

347
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,945
Olaf, sing!

348
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,390
There was a dozen virgins

349
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,260
Friesians, Danes and Franks

350
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:19,234
We took them for some swifan
And all we got were wanks

351
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:23,899
Oh, we are Beowulf's army
Each a mighty thane

352
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,636
We'll pummel your asses
And ravage your lasses

353
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,972
Then do it all over again

354
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,480
The fattest of the virgins
I knew her for a whore

355
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,881
I gave her all my codpiece
And still she wanted more

356
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,387
Her sister was from Norway
She cost me 20 groats

357
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,925
She showed me there was more ways
Than one to sow my oats

358
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,257
Her mother was from Iceland
And she was mighty hot

359
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:49,094
She'd need a whole damn iceberg
To cool her burning...

360
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,799
Grendel. He knocks.

361
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:02,805
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa.

362
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:03,902
She's ready for me
to taste her juicy fruit.

363
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,004
My Lord.

364
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,887
Patience, patience, my love.

365
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,090
No! Hondshew! No!

366
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,768
Swife me! It's the frican' monster!

367
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,085
I swear, the bastard has no pintel!

368
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,995
- No pintel.
- Aye.

369
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,523
- The demon shrinks!
- It shrinks! It shrinks!

370
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,506
Demon!

371
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,952
Your bloodletting
days are finished, demon!

372
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,395
It speaks. It speaks!

373
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:59,570
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.

374
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:03,579
I am the teeth in the darkness,
the talons in the night.

375
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,048
Mine is strength and lust and power!

376
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,346
I am Beowulf!

377
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,037
Grendel's arm!

378
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,816
You've done it!

379
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,585
He's done it!

380
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,223
He's torn the limbs from the beast!
Beowulf has killed him!

381
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:53,219
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

382
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,026
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

383
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,159
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

384
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,197
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon!

385
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,740
Odin be praised.

386
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:12,737
- Go tell the scops. Spread the word!
- Yes, my Lord.

387
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,145
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

388
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,124
Our nightmare is over.

389
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,853
Come to bed, my sweet.

390
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,497
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son! It's time you did your duty.

391
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,234
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

392
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,140
I should never have told you.

393
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,508
I should never have told you.

394
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,771
My poor son.

395
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,852
Sleep now, my son.

396
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,693
Who murdered you, my son?

397
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:48,104
He will pay, meen darling.

398
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,782
Beowulf.

399
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,522
They were great warriors.

400
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,164
They died a foul death.

401
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:52,868
They were murdered by a foul creature
from the depths of hell.

402
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,537
The bards
will sing of their glory forever.

403
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,987
Come, let us drink to their memory.

404
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,887
I want you to raise the first cup.

405
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,484
I am not in the mood for merrymaking.

406
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,759
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

407
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,229
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,
do we not?

408
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,435
Aye.

409
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,874
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

410
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,681
this place for me
has been a hall of sadness.

411
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,286
And for all of us,

412
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,982
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed, and death.

413
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:45,152
But today,
the monster's reign has ended.

414
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:49,460
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

415
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:53,730
I wonder if Beowulf's strength is only
in his arms, or in his legs as well,

416
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,702
all three of them?

417
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,208
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

418
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,643
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

419
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,214
Bring it here!

420
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,646
Wealthow, my love,

421
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,647
why don't you do the honors?

422
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,863
For you, my Lord.

423
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,110
Thank you, great King.

424
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,577
And all of you,

425
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:51,026
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

426
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,121
I was asleep when he arrived.

427
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:58,292
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

428
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:03,669
He stood 20 feet tall,
possessing the strength of 10 men.

429
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:08,643
I looked at him and said,
"I am Beowulf!"

430
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,205
Brave thane.

431
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,609
My Queen.

432
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,958
I love you.

433
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,424
I want you, my King.

434
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,902
Only you.

435
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:19,105
My hero, meen looviyend.

436
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,071
I don't understand.

437
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,412
Where's your husband?

438
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,110
Dead.

439
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,111
Dead?

440
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,820
This is a dream.

441
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,158
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

442
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,196
Me, darling? A dream?

443
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:48,436
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

444
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,407
In the name of Odin!

445
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,011
Is Grendel not dead?

446
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,239
Has he grown his arm anew?

447
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,682
It's not Grendel.

448
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,310
Not Grendel? Then who?

449
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,888
His mother.

450
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,624
It's Grendel you killed.

451
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:48,323
I had hoped his mother
had left the land long, long ago.

452
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,628
How many monsters must I slay?

453
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,265
Grendel's mother? Father?
Grendel's uncle?

454
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:00,707
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

455
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,141
She is the last of them.

456
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,576
With her gone,

457
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,241
demonkind will slip back
into the darkness from whence it came.

458
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,840
Where it belongs.

459
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:13,150
And the mother's mate?
Where is Grendel's father?

460
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,828
Grendel's father
can do no harm to man.

461
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,565
Beowulf,

462
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:31,235
I was wrong to doubt you before,
and I shall not again.

463
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:35,437
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

464
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,343
Granted.

465
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,678
Cain! Cain!

466
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:56,398
Take my sword.
It belonged to my father's father.

467
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,763
It's called "Hrunting."

468
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:02,463
That sword is no match
for demon magic.

469
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,068
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

470
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:15,608
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers.

471
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,884
They were hasty words.

472
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:25,625
Unferth, I may not return.

473
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,564
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

474
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:35,067
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

475
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,176
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

476
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,088
are you still with me?

477
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,058
To the end.

478
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,380
Look.

479
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,492
She's probably a water demon.

480
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,530
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

481
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,894
I know.

482
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:41,031
Do you want me to go in with you?

483
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,764
Good.

484
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,362
I'll be here.

485
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,659
I see you've brought me treasure.

486
00:58:00,432 --> 00:58:02,195
Show yourself!

487
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,337
What are you?

488
00:58:54,486 --> 00:58:57,319
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

489
00:59:17,142 --> 00:59:19,110
The Bee-Wolf.

490
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:22,278
The bear.

491
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,891
Such a strong man you are.

492
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:41,224
With the strength of a king.

493
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:46,166
The king you will one day become.

494
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:52,968
What do you know of me, demon?

495
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:57,447
I know that underneath your glamour

496
00:59:57,549 --> 01:00:01,815
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

497
01:00:04,123 --> 01:00:05,954
My glamour?

498
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:11,428
One needs glamour to become a king.

499
01:00:13,866 --> 01:00:19,463
A man like you could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

500
01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:23,573
Your story would live on

501
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:29,307
when everything now alive is dust.

502
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:38,052
Beowulf.

503
01:00:40,058 --> 01:00:43,323
It has been a long time

504
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:46,159
since a man has come to visit me.

505
01:00:47,266 --> 01:00:49,791
I need no sword to kill you.

506
01:00:52,037 --> 01:00:55,131
Of course you don't, my love.

507
01:00:57,709 --> 01:01:00,303
You took a son from me.

508
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:05,183
Give me a son, brave thane.

509
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:09,484
Stay with me.

510
01:01:10,756 --> 01:01:12,417
Love me.

511
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,594
Love me

512
01:01:16,695 --> 01:01:22,930
and I shall weave you riches
beyond imagination.

513
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:26,894
I shall make you

514
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:31,370
the greatest king that ever lived.

515
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:44,113
As long as you hold me in your heart

516
01:01:44,223 --> 01:01:49,718
and this golden horn
remains in my keeping,

517
01:01:51,163 --> 01:01:53,654
you will forever be king.

518
01:01:56,368 --> 01:01:58,199
Forever strong,

519
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,063
mighty

520
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,899
and all powerful.

521
01:02:05,577 --> 01:02:08,740
This I promise.

522
01:02:13,452 --> 01:02:18,116
This I swear.

523
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:39,309
My Lord.

524
01:02:41,246 --> 01:02:43,373
It's dead, my Lady.

525
01:02:43,482 --> 01:02:48,249
When I finished off
Grendel's monstrous mother,

526
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:50,412
I severed the brute's head.

527
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:53,386
Our curse is lifted.

528
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:57,322
Our curse is lifted. Odin be praised!

529
01:02:57,429 --> 01:02:59,329
Beowulf be praised!

530
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:02,299
Our curse is lifted.

531
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:06,994
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!

532
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:10,041
Into the sea, quickly.

533
01:03:13,078 --> 01:03:17,105
I plunged Hrunting
into Grendel's mother's chest

534
01:03:17,215 --> 01:03:21,117
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

535
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:23,687
the creature sprang back to life,

536
01:03:23,789 --> 01:03:28,351
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

537
01:03:29,695 --> 01:03:31,595
Till Ragnarok, huh?

538
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:38,867
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

539
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:47,204
More mead, my Lord?

540
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:48,438
Aye.

541
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:54,113
And the drinking horn, do you have it?

542
01:03:54,886 --> 01:03:56,012
No.

543
01:03:57,489 --> 01:04:02,358
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

544
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:04,793
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

545
01:04:04,896 --> 01:04:07,364
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

546
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:12,835
When she was dead, I looked for it,
but it was gone forever.

547
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:17,801
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

548
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,908
First, the hero and I must talk.

549
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:25,880
Beowulf.

550
01:04:33,892 --> 01:04:36,759
So you brought back
the head of Grendel.

551
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:40,120
What about the head of the mother?

552
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:43,897
With her dead and cold in the bog,

553
01:04:44,002 --> 01:04:47,460
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

554
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:50,668
Did you kill her?

555
01:04:51,476 --> 01:04:56,038
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

556
01:04:57,849 --> 01:05:01,751
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

557
01:05:02,788 --> 01:05:06,884
But answer me, did you kill her?

558
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:17,261
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

559
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,470
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

560
01:05:29,047 --> 01:05:31,174
He can bother me no more.

561
01:05:31,983 --> 01:05:37,046
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

562
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,448
Not anymore.

563
01:05:42,027 --> 01:05:43,551
Not anymore.

564
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:47,725
Listen to me!

565
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,630
Listen to me!

566
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:57,334
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

567
01:05:57,442 --> 01:06:01,742
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

568
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:04,372
and laid its mother in her grave...

569
01:06:04,483 --> 01:06:07,145
- To Beowulf!
- Long live Beowulf!

570
01:06:07,252 --> 01:06:10,380
...and because I have no heir,

571
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:14,381
I have no sons,

572
01:06:16,261 --> 01:06:19,355
I declare that on my death,

573
01:06:19,464 --> 01:06:22,524
all that I possess, my kingdom,

574
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:26,629
my hall of sadness and shame,

575
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:31,097
and even my lovely young Queen,

576
01:06:33,345 --> 01:06:34,812
my Wealthow,

577
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,319
everything, everything

578
01:06:45,457 --> 01:06:49,518
I leave to this, our hero.

579
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:51,926
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

580
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,300
I have spoken!

581
01:07:00,305 --> 01:07:02,273
When I am gone,

582
01:07:02,374 --> 01:07:06,868
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

583
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:18,120
Beowulf!

584
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:24,284
My Lord.

585
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:28,197
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

586
01:07:42,614 --> 01:07:44,206
Hrothgar!

587
01:07:50,722 --> 01:07:52,451
He must have fallen.

588
01:08:23,855 --> 01:08:28,690
- All hail King Beowulf.
- All hail King Beowulf.

589
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:31,091
All hail King Beowulf.

590
01:08:34,099 --> 01:08:35,794
King Beowulf.

591
01:09:11,002 --> 01:09:12,629
Archers.

592
01:09:12,737 --> 01:09:14,534
Archers!

593
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:48,371
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

594
01:09:48,473 --> 01:09:50,270
This is slaughter.

595
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:55,677
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

596
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,975
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

597
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,108
It's going to be a short song.

598
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:01,651
Now, can you blame them?

599
01:10:01,753 --> 01:10:03,482
Your legend is known
from the high seas

600
01:10:03,588 --> 01:10:05,818
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

601
01:10:05,924 --> 01:10:07,824
You are the monster slayer.

602
01:10:07,926 --> 01:10:10,326
We men are the monsters now.

603
01:10:12,364 --> 01:10:15,162
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

604
01:10:16,234 --> 01:10:18,566
The Christ God has killed it,

605
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:23,698
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

606
01:10:23,808 --> 01:10:26,572
fear and shame.

607
01:10:26,678 --> 01:10:30,614
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

608
01:10:31,383 --> 01:10:33,578
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

609
01:10:33,685 --> 01:10:35,152
Leave him!

610
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:39,218
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

611
01:10:39,324 --> 01:10:42,691
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

612
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:44,523
Coward!

613
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,255
Kill me yourself!

614
01:10:47,365 --> 01:10:50,926
Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

615
01:10:51,036 --> 01:10:54,130
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

616
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,365
Stop!

617
01:11:05,717 --> 01:11:09,084
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

618
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:13,523
Let him up.

619
01:11:18,096 --> 01:11:21,293
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

620
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:28,137
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

621
01:11:32,877 --> 01:11:36,074
I'm Finn of Frisia

622
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:39,309
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

623
01:11:39,417 --> 01:11:41,442
Only if you kill me!

624
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:45,419
Otherwise, you're nothing.

625
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:50,852
You think you're the first to try to kill me,
or the hundredth?

626
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:55,565
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

627
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:59,068
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

628
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:03,732
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

629
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:08,142
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

630
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:15,346
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

631
01:12:15,453 --> 01:12:18,513
Someone give him a sword, or I'll...

632
01:12:19,424 --> 01:12:22,450
You'll what? Kill me?

633
01:12:23,428 --> 01:12:27,762
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

634
01:12:45,049 --> 01:12:48,075
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

635
01:12:49,988 --> 01:12:54,584
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

636
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:03,426
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

637
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:05,537
He has a story to tell.

638
01:13:34,766 --> 01:13:36,256
Your Majesty?

639
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:38,568
Are you hurt?

640
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:41,761
Not a scratch.

641
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,105
So beautiful.

642
01:13:52,517 --> 01:13:54,280
And so young.

643
01:13:54,953 --> 01:13:57,888
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

644
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:02,016
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

645
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:04,686
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

646
01:14:04,796 --> 01:14:07,993
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

647
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:14,503
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

648
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:20,177
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

649
01:14:23,147 --> 01:14:25,843
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

650
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:28,848
Perhaps tonight?

651
01:14:28,953 --> 01:14:32,889
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

652
01:14:32,991 --> 01:14:35,357
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

653
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:38,896
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

654
01:14:38,997 --> 01:14:42,956
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

655
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:46,059
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

656
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:51,675
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

657
01:14:57,081 --> 01:14:59,515
I see you've survived.

658
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:05,219
Alas, my Queen,

659
01:15:06,257 --> 01:15:09,920
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

660
01:15:10,028 --> 01:15:12,292
You are not a widow,

661
01:15:12,397 --> 01:15:13,386
yet.

662
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,963
How comforting, my husband.

663
01:15:21,306 --> 01:15:24,833
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

664
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:31,174
Unferth.

665
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:35,035
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

666
01:16:35,146 --> 01:16:37,341
I have something for the King.

667
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:39,581
What is it?

668
01:16:39,684 --> 01:16:42,619
I said I have something for the King.

669
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,120
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

670
01:16:45,223 --> 01:16:47,384
You will show it to me first.

671
01:16:47,725 --> 01:16:49,556
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

672
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,356
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

673
01:16:52,463 --> 01:16:53,794
The King

674
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,662
needs to see what?

675
01:17:04,976 --> 01:17:08,434
Lost and now found.

676
01:17:17,755 --> 01:17:20,155
A gift fit for a king.

677
01:17:23,928 --> 01:17:25,896
Do you recognize it?

678
01:17:29,734 --> 01:17:32,202
Where did you find this?

679
01:17:32,303 --> 01:17:37,468
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

680
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:41,170
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

681
01:17:42,747 --> 01:17:44,146
My Lord,

682
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,417
isn't this...

683
01:18:00,598 --> 01:18:02,395
So, Lord Beowulf,

684
01:18:08,573 --> 01:18:13,203
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

685
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:17,941
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

686
01:18:18,049 --> 01:18:20,279
Please, please don't kill me!

687
01:18:20,384 --> 01:18:23,444
Where did you find this treasure?

688
01:18:23,554 --> 01:18:26,455
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

689
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:28,457
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

690
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:30,788
Stop.

691
01:18:37,902 --> 01:18:39,028
Where?

692
01:18:40,004 --> 01:18:42,700
Up, up on the moors.

693
01:18:44,242 --> 01:18:47,473
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

694
01:18:48,913 --> 01:18:50,312
Is that all?

695
01:18:52,049 --> 01:18:54,609
No demon? No witch?

696
01:18:57,421 --> 01:18:58,718
No woman?

697
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:14,162
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

698
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:20,142
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

699
01:19:20,244 --> 01:19:25,841
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

700
01:19:30,555 --> 01:19:35,049
Look at you. You're nothing,

701
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:37,855
an empty nothing.

702
01:19:37,962 --> 01:19:39,725
Come forth!

703
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,821
Show yourself!

704
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:47,269
Even with all your riches,

705
01:19:48,339 --> 01:19:52,036
your kingdom, your power, your glory

706
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:55,378
and your women.

707
01:19:58,249 --> 01:20:02,515
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

708
01:20:03,621 --> 01:20:06,954
your pretty little bedwarmer,

709
01:20:07,058 --> 01:20:09,788
or your wise Queen?

710
01:20:12,496 --> 01:20:14,054
What are you?

711
01:20:18,202 --> 01:20:20,670
I'm something you left behind,

712
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,307
Father!

713
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,657
Another restless night?

714
01:20:56,741 --> 01:20:58,538
It's all right, girl.

715
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,411
I'm not going to eat you.

716
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:12,114
He has bad dreams.

717
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:15,488
They've been coming more often.

718
01:21:16,727 --> 01:21:20,128
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

719
01:21:27,371 --> 01:21:29,839
He calls your name in his sleep.

720
01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:33,342
Does he?

721
01:21:39,283 --> 01:21:43,049
I believe he still holds you in his heart.

722
01:21:44,955 --> 01:21:46,217
Do you?

723
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,828
I often wonder

724
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:55,688
what happened.

725
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,233
To us?

726
01:22:03,107 --> 01:22:04,938
Too many secrets.

727
01:22:11,582 --> 01:22:13,516
God, help us.

728
01:22:40,811 --> 01:22:43,939
What? What do you want of me?

729
01:22:45,483 --> 01:22:49,749
I have a message for my father.

730
01:22:50,821 --> 01:22:53,153
Tell me! What did this?

731
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:57,658
I saw our whole village burn.
Children screaming as they died!

732
01:22:57,762 --> 01:23:00,731
I saw it, Your Majesty,
vomiting fire and smoke!

733
01:23:00,831 --> 01:23:02,731
Damn you! What was it?

734
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,266
A dragon!

735
01:23:05,536 --> 01:23:07,834
- It's Unferth, my Lord!
- Unferth.

736
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:11,405
You say a dragon did this? Stop!

737
01:23:14,245 --> 01:23:17,043
You had an agreement.

738
01:23:17,548 --> 01:23:19,914
You would not be harmed.

739
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:22,952
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

740
01:23:23,053 --> 01:23:25,544
The agreement is ended.

741
01:23:25,656 --> 01:23:27,681
Who? Who said that?

742
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:30,090
"The sins of the fathers!"

743
01:23:31,095 --> 01:23:34,155
That's the last thing I heard.

744
01:23:34,265 --> 01:23:38,668
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

745
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:41,499
The sins of the fathers!

746
01:23:42,907 --> 01:23:45,876
Sins of the fathers!

747
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:49,101
The sins of the fathers!

748
01:23:50,481 --> 01:23:53,211
The sins of the fathers!

749
01:23:59,223 --> 01:24:02,852
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

750
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,724
It is our only hope if I fail.

751
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,127
My Lord.

752
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:12,869
Don't go, I beg you!

753
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:15,370
You are free. I release you.

754
01:24:16,707 --> 01:24:20,700
Find a good man and bear him children.
But bear him a son.

755
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:22,711
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

756
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:25,373
I am not the man you think me to be!

757
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:29,782
You're a great man! And a hero!
This I know to be true.

758
01:24:29,887 --> 01:24:32,788
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

759
01:24:46,804 --> 01:24:48,931
Very impressive, dear.

760
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:52,475
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

761
01:24:53,978 --> 01:24:55,639
I'm sure it did.

762
01:25:00,618 --> 01:25:03,143
Why don't you take that poor girl

763
01:25:03,254 --> 01:25:06,553
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

764
01:25:06,657 --> 01:25:09,285
Let some young hero save us.

765
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:10,819
What?

766
01:25:11,395 --> 01:25:14,990
And let the nightmare
start all over again?

767
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,502
No. I visited this horror
upon my kingdom.

768
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:24,836
- I must be the one to finish her.
- Her.

769
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:31,378
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

770
01:25:33,484 --> 01:25:35,315
A beauty so costly?

771
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:45,652
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

772
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:52,228
I was weak.

773
01:25:55,105 --> 01:25:56,663
I am sorry.

774
01:25:59,877 --> 01:26:01,970
So, so sorry.

775
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:09,817
I have always loved you, my Queen.

776
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:14,056
And I you.

777
01:26:24,702 --> 01:26:26,567
Keep a memory of me,

778
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:30,265
not as a king or a hero,

779
01:26:31,976 --> 01:26:33,466
but as a man,

780
01:26:34,878 --> 01:26:36,778
fallible and flawed.

781
01:26:54,031 --> 01:26:55,999
This is the place.

782
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,660
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

783
01:27:02,573 --> 01:27:05,371
Wiglaf, I have no sons,

784
01:27:06,443 --> 01:27:10,812
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds

785
01:27:10,914 --> 01:27:12,245
that you shall be king.

786
01:27:12,349 --> 01:27:14,874
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

787
01:27:18,455 --> 01:27:21,856
Great friend,
there is something you should know.

788
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:24,723
Nay! There is nothing I should know.

789
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:28,059
You are Beowulf.
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

790
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:30,656
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

791
01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:33,202
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps

792
01:27:33,303 --> 01:27:35,635
and get on with our bloody lives!

793
01:27:40,978 --> 01:27:43,640
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No.

794
01:27:45,549 --> 01:27:46,777
Good.

795
01:28:33,297 --> 01:28:34,730
Beowulf.

796
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:38,393
It has been a long time.

797
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:50,241
Take your damned horn
and leave my land in peace.

798
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,048
Too late, my love.

799
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:19,275
Odin's swifan balls!

800
01:29:28,185 --> 01:29:30,085
It's heading for Herot!

801
01:30:33,617 --> 01:30:35,175
Now!

802
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,551
Hrothgar.

803
01:31:56,366 --> 01:31:59,358
Come on, come on!
Come on! Come on!

804
01:32:11,048 --> 01:32:12,310
Damn you!

805
01:32:18,855 --> 01:32:22,256
I'll have your lizard head on a spike!

806
01:34:32,856 --> 01:34:34,517
No!

807
01:36:28,939 --> 01:36:30,304
My Lord!

808
01:36:59,669 --> 01:37:03,765
No!

809
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:37,591
Over here! Attend the Queen.

810
01:38:37,701 --> 01:38:39,862
- Attend the Queen.
- Attend the Queen.

811
01:40:22,705 --> 01:40:25,606
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

812
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:29,403
Let's get you to a healer.

813
01:40:29,512 --> 01:40:31,503
Not this time, old friend.

814
01:40:32,215 --> 01:40:34,445
You are Beowulf.

815
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:38,009
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

816
01:40:38,788 --> 01:40:41,450
Do you hear her?

817
01:40:44,394 --> 01:40:46,123
I hear nothing.

818
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:50,228
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

819
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:52,028
- No, my Lord.
- My...

820
01:40:52,135 --> 01:40:55,468
You killed Grendel's mother
when we were young.

821
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:58,532
They sing of it.

822
01:41:00,276 --> 01:41:02,710
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

823
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:06,514
Too late.

824
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:15,249
He was

825
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,812
the bravest of us.

826
01:42:23,092 --> 01:42:24,992
He was the prince

827
01:42:26,863 --> 01:42:28,660
of all warriors.

828
01:42:32,568 --> 01:42:35,059
His name will live forever.

829
01:42:46,449 --> 01:42:48,974
His song shall be sung forever.
