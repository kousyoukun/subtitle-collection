1
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,244
<i>This is Bel Air...</i>

2
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,942
<i>...the lush, luxurious retreat
of the wealthy and powerful.</i>

3
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,112
<i>If you work in the motion picture industry
and are successful...</i>

4
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:05,056
<i>...this well-tended suburb of Hollywood is
where you will probably make your home.</i>

5
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,355
<i>Failure is not permitted here.</i>

6
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:11,027
<i>Our story has to do
with a 20th-century phenomenon.</i>

7
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,231
<i>Name: Charlie Castle.</i>

8
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,967
<i>Profession: movie star.</i>

9
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,874
<i>Problem: survival.</i>

10
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:22,877
<i>Charlie Castle is a man
who sold out his dreams...</i>

11
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,071
<i>...but he can't forget them.</i>

12
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:41,654
<i>Great, isn't he?</i>

13
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:42,994
What a guy.

14
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,227
<i>Tell him l'm here.</i>

15
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:47,304
<i>Sure, Patty, right away.
l know he'll be glad to see you.</i>

16
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:57,749
Hold it.

17
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:02,113
<i>-What's up, Buddy?
-Patty Benedict's here.</i>

18
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,450
What, did she just walk in?

19
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,495
l was told she was going to drop by here,
l raced right over.

20
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,224
Patty Benedict.

21
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,529
<i>You had me tied up in there, didn't you?</i>

22
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:17,159
l faked you in. You came in too fast, sweetheart.

23
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,965
<i>What's Patty want, Charlie?</i>

24
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,671
Marion, separation....

25
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:24,175
How does it get around? What did you tell her?

26
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:27,439
<i>Nothing. lf l had, she wouldn't be here now.</i>

27
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:30,344
l work for the studio.
l have to keep you out of trouble.

28
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,418
Good.

29
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:34,378
So get me out of this.

30
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:36,614
-Play ball with her, huh?
-Play ball?

31
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:39,285
<i>l'd like to play ball with her head.</i>

32
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,793
Take it easy, will you?

33
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,454
<i>Schmooze her a little.
She's got 18 million readers.</i>

34
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,325
<i>l'll have her out of here in five minutes flat.</i>

35
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,095
Relax, Buddy. Stop worrying.

36
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,869
<i>l've handled this a hundred times.</i>

37
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,173
What a guy.

38
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:55,770
You had me scared there for a minute.

39
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,311
Patty, darling.

40
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:03,953
How are you, sweetie?

41
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:06,679
-Light my cigarette, Chuck.
-Sure.

42
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,918
<i>What happened to you last night?
l looked around and you'd gone.</i>

43
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:10,994
l asked Mike, but--

44
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:13,255
Smiley Coy had somebody
he wanted me to meet...

45
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:16,162
...some of those strip shirts from out of town.

46
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,962
Who wants what from the lemonade stand?

47
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:21,465
-Buddy?
-No, no, thanks.

48
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:23,370
l like the airiness of this room.

49
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,738
-French paintings, dear one?
-Yeah.

50
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:29,943
<i>Don't you buy American anymore?</i>

51
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:33,018
<i>Let nothing you dismay,
l don't know one painter from another.</i>

52
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,983
<i>He doesn't know one painter from another.</i>

53
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,385
<i>l wouldn't want my fans to think l'd gone arty.</i>

54
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,858
<i>-They're Marion's hobby.
-Yeah, they're his wife's hobby.</i>

55
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,957
How long do l know you, Chuck?

56
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,690
Nine, ten years.

57
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:48,099
When we first met,
all you could talk about was the New Deal...

58
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,601
...or the fair deal or some deal.

59
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:52,401
l believed in it.

60
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,135
What do you believe in now?

61
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,973
Health, hard work, rare roast beef...

62
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:01,237
...and good scripts.

63
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,783
<i>You're a lot smarter child than you used to be.</i>

64
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,284
l had to learn, Patricia.

65
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:06,353
<i>Charlie's slogan:</i>

66
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:08,184
<i>''Got a message, send for Western Union.''</i>

67
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,917
<i>l hear your new picture's good.</i>

68
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,790
<i>lt'll pay a dividend.</i>

69
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,294
-What about your new contract?
-What about it, Buddy?

70
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,863
The studio got the contracts all--

71
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:18,728
Stanley Hoff told me last week,
you were about to re-sign.

72
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,963
<i>He's the head of the studio.
lt doesn't cost him a thing to dream.</i>

73
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,168
Are you and Stanley having a feud?

74
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,569
How could l feud with Uncle Hoff?

75
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,611
<i>-Mr. Hoff's been like a father to Charlie.
-Why, sure.</i>

76
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,504
<i>Chuck, l'm off to Metro.</i>

77
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:35,312
But before l go, l want the truth
about the separation rumors.

78
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,547
<i>She's always trying to tag me.
The rumors are just that, rumors.</i>

79
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:43,886
But why in the world--

80
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,519
<i>Marion took Billy to the beach
because he's got a cold.</i>

81
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,394
<i>l don't think l'd ever forgive you...</i>

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,298
...lf someone else printed
your divorce story before l did.

83
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,635
l hope you understand that.

84
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:58,536
He understands that.

85
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:00,311
Do l?

86
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:04,574
-What Charlie means by that is--
-Shut up for five minutes.

87
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:07,517
<i>l want my gossip from the horse's mouth,
not his tail.</i>

88
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,177
<i>Patty, it's his living.</i>

89
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:12,349
ls it impossible for you to be democratic?

90
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:19,194
Fix yourself a drink, Buddy.

91
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:26,865
<i>Look, l don't want you to get stiff, take a chill.</i>

92
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,540
-How are you, Miss Benedict?
-Fine, thank you, Nick.

93
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:35,038
<i>Well, that's nice.
l've got everything ready for your rub.</i>

94
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,712
Thanks, character.

95
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,783
<i>One thing l've never understood.</i>

96
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:43,415
Why did the studio give Bliss back his job
after that scandalous mess?

97
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:49,729
<i>Buddy Bliss is a first-rate publicity man.
He's also a close personal friend.</i>

98
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:50,560
l know.

99
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,897
You were a character witness for him
and you paid all his legal fees.

100
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:57,405
<i>l don't get your point, sweetie.
Buddy went to jail for 10 months.</i>

101
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,708
<i>Besides, it's all past and forgotten.</i>

102
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:02,409
<i>lt's not forgotten if l choose to revive it.</i>

103
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,139
Now, why would you want to do that?

104
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:07,478
Some of you forget that
this town has got to keep its skirts clean.

105
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:10,383
At the studio Christmas party,
this idiot steals your car--

106
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:13,082
-He borrowed my car.
-He drives along half-drunk--

107
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,556
<i>He wasn't drunk. That was cleared in court.</i>

108
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,591
The fact remains, he hit and ran.

109
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,162
How friendly did you feel when Big Brains here...

110
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:23,666
...ditched the car on your lawn
and the police walked in Christmas Eve?

111
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,327
-All he did--
-Now, Patty.

112
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:27,371
All he did, your dear friend...

113
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:30,202
...was to almost ruin a career
right out of the storybooks.

114
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:32,742
l thought we could be human enough
to forgive that.

115
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,335
<i>Didn't he step up in time and take the blame?</i>

116
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:39,576
Well, l still think it was
very poor public relations...

117
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:41,745
...giving him his job back that way.

118
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:46,983
With all the headlines in this crazy,
mixed-up world...

119
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:50,222
...why would you want to open up
that tired old can of peas?

120
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:55,365
<i>l'll make a swap.</i>

121
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,264
What about your marriage?

122
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:07,581
ls this your answer?

123
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,376
<i>You've just done a very foolish thing.</i>

124
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:20,524
Thanks for the visit.
Be well and strong. God bless.

125
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:30,205
Hello.

126
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,001
Am l interrupting anything important?

127
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,677
-Hello, Mrs. Castle.
-Hello, Miss Benedict.

128
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:45,679
Hi, honey.

129
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:51,293
<i>l didn't know you were in the house.</i>

130
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:53,522
Well, l just came into town to shop.

131
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,700
-Hello, Marion.
-Hi, Buddy.

132
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,567
<i>You know there's innate power in the world, Bud,
needs publicity.</i>

133
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:04,039
What laundries do to sheets and pillowcases.

134
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,270
<i>-Every month l buy a dozen.
-Why don't you try the May Company?</i>

135
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,280
They sell a fine percale sheet
at a really modest price.

136
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,816
Tell me, Mrs. Castle,
do you and Charlie still use a double bed?

137
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,290
<i>Or is that a foolish question,
since you're separated now?</i>

138
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,789
<i>You are separated, aren't you?</i>

139
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,529
Patty, you sure take the cake for persistence.

140
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,999
<i>We're all sensible, sophisticated people.
There's no use wearing crepe.</i>

141
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:32,436
There were over 400,000 divorce cases
in this country last year.

142
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,039
<i>lt's getting as common as the ordinary head cold.</i>

143
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,372
You know, you may be right, Miss Benedict.

144
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,037
However, l find it sad.

145
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,341
And our personal life is not your affair.

146
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,119
<i>And you're the child who'll tell me.</i>

147
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,179
<i>l'm the one in this town who's not afraid
to tell you to mind your own business.</i>

148
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:52,892
<i>All right,
l'm glad we've come to an understanding.</i>

149
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:54,687
-Now, Patty--
-No, Chuck.

150
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,322
<i>l know when l've worn out my welcome.
l'm aware of that.</i>

151
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,764
<i>For Pete's sake!</i>

152
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:01,996
<i>Ace, you'd better do something,
or we'll all end up the creek.</i>

153
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,067
<i>Look, angel, what do you think you're doing?</i>

154
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,873
<i>She doesn't play Madam Fry with me,
not in my own house.</i>

155
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,112
Patty, wait!

156
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,752
<i>l'm in the movie business.</i>

157
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:19,688
<i>l can't afford your acute attacks of integrity.</i>

158
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,792
Oh, the way you talk to her!

159
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,623
<i>-How's that?
-Liquid honey.</i>

160
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:28,994
<i>-l'm insincere with her.
-Husband, be insincere with me.</i>

161
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,468
<i>Patty's got 18 million readers.
Why antagonize her? Where's the sense?</i>

162
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:35,301
From time to time,
l believe in being completely senseless.

163
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,170
<i>l'm a woman, not a diplomat.</i>

164
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:40,276
<i>The way you said ''God bless'' to that one!</i>

165
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,711
l should think
it would make you want to throw up.

166
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,612
<i>Of course, you're not sincere.</i>

167
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,283
How have you been?

168
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,852
Fine. Just fine.

169
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,761
<i>You know, l'm beginning to like this picture.</i>

170
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,395
Could make the Olympic team.

171
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,330
<i>You're right about this Rouault guy.</i>

172
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,102
<i>He broods. There's a certain quality.
l don't know.</i>

173
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:13,775
<i>l've been looking at it a lot the last few days.</i>

174
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,908
<i>Sometimes, when l'm alone lately...</i>

175
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:23,654
...an old clown waiting in the wings,
waiting to go on.

176
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,990
<i>Cut a few capers, knock 'em dead.</i>

177
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,530
<i>But he's done it a million times.</i>

178
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:34,027
<i>lt doesn't mean anything anymore.</i>

179
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,477
<i>-Too fortissimo?
-No.</i>

180
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:50,549
<i>l'd buy it all back.</i>

181
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,118
<i>How's Billy?</i>

182
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,962
<i>l haven't seen him for two weeks.</i>

183
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:02,589
-Three weeks.
-Okay, three weeks.

184
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:04,362
He has a cold.

185
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,239
Fever?

186
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:12,572
<i>But, you know, it hangs on.
You just can't keep him out of the ocean.</i>

187
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:19,817
-ls it lonely at the beach?
-Yes.

188
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:23,587
Very lonely?

189
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,420
<i>Charlie, don't start this, please.</i>

190
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,357
Come back, angel, l can change.

191
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:31,124
<i>How can you change?
You've been this way for so long.</i>

192
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:33,131
<i>l can. You've got to believe me on this.</i>

193
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,828
l have believed you before this,
any number of times.

194
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:39,896
<i>-You don't think those occasional girls--
-Yes, l do think those occasional girls!</i>

195
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,008
Surprised?

196
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:47,142
A man can live only one of two ways,
either married or like a bachelor.

197
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,652
<i>What you want is the best of both!
And that's not a marriage, not in my book.</i>

198
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:56,982
Charlie Cass...

199
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,490
...he was a wonder.

200
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,827
l was Mrs. Cass.

201
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,391
<i>Now you're Hoff's Mr. Castle.</i>

202
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,030
<i>Come on. l don't buy that.</i>

203
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,202
<i>l don't belong to Stanley Hoff!</i>

204
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,705
<i>-No?
-No! l'm a free agent!</i>

205
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,776
Are you going to sign his new contract?

206
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,676
Marion, l want you to come back home to me.

207
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:18,512
-Just like that?
-Yes.

208
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:21,016
<i>l'm far from perfect,
but you're making a mistake...</i>

209
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:24,383
...if you think you can face
this big, wide world alone.

210
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:29,053
<i>Don't tell me you've got Billy,
because he still eats a grape in four bites.</i>

211
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,159
<i>Without me, you don't have a family.</i>

212
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,096
<i>You don't even have a friend,
unless it's Hank Teagle.</i>

213
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,765
Hank was my friend long before he was yours.

214
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:40,898
Hank asked me to marry him last night.

215
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:42,775
And?

216
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,134
What did you say?

217
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:48,208
What could l say?

218
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,249
<i>He's got his nerve.</i>

219
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:54,917
<i>-All he said was ''if.''
-lf?</i>

220
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,487
<i>l tried to avoid this conversation, didn't l?</i>

221
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:02,619
<i>Okay, you win.
Famous husband remarks, ''You win.''</i>

222
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:06,323
<i>Please, don't be such a housewife.</i>

223
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,801
Leave the lousy glasses alone!
We pay somebody to do that!

224
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:10,938
Russell!

225
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,118
Look.

226
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,715
The lousy strap is broken on my watch, too.

227
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,722
<i>l'll be needing a check for Monday.</i>

228
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,995
The bills are piling up.

229
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:43,796
<i>All right, l'll have Harold send it from the office.</i>

230
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,255
<i>Why, Mrs. Castle, l didn't hear you come in.</i>

231
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,756
-This is a real pleasure.
-Thank you, Russell.

232
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,586
Everything running all right?

233
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,631
Smooth as silk, Mrs. Castle. Just fine.

234
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,825
<i>That's good. l'll see you before l leave.</i>

235
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,096
Thank you.

236
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:16,268
<i>-Would you mind taking this out?
-Yes, ma'am.</i>

237
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:29,386
Are you renewing with Hoff or not?

238
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,822
Where does Hank get the nerve
to propose to you?

239
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:35,089
<i>Forget about Hank.
He's leaving for New York in two weeks.</i>

240
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,719
To find a 40-cent gin?

241
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:40,300
<i>He's writing a new novel.
He's been on the wagon for weeks.</i>

242
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,038
Look, you say you want me
to come back to you.

243
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:47,739
<i>Well, believe me, l won't,
not ever, if you sign that contract.</i>

244
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:49,104
Oh, that again!

245
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:53,914
l never expected to see the day when
a firm deal would give you chills and fever!

246
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:55,475
Neither did l.

247
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:57,177
<i>l'm as human as the next one.</i>

248
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,086
<i>lt's a fabulous deal, but it's seven years,
and the life that comes with it....</i>

249
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,551
Or should l say the death that goes with it?

250
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,854
<i>Look at yourself. You're half-dead right now.</i>

251
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,329
<i>l haven't seen you sparkle in years.</i>

252
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:13,528
<i>You put on a show for other people,
but l'm your wife, l know it.</i>

253
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:16,731
Charlie, my Charlie...

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,174
<i>...what's happened to your mind,
your spirit, your soul?</i>

255
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,844
Charlie Cass, the guy l married....

256
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:26,178
He was a tiger. He liked to argue.

257
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,549
Because you believed in something...

258
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,951
...and what you believed in, you fought for.

259
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,917
And that was Charlie Cass.

260
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,622
What do you believe in now?

261
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,633
What do you want? The wild-eyed kid l was...

262
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,362
...nursing a cup of coffee in Walgreens,
yelling about the sad state of the theater?

263
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,173
<i>l'll tell you what l don't want.</i>

264
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,378
<i>l don't want one of those witless,
sold-out guys sitting around a gin table...</i>

265
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,515
...swapping phone numbers and the latest dirt!

266
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,683
How you talk.

267
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,344
<i>Charlie, l don't want you to sign that contract.</i>

268
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,988
You gave the studio their pound of flesh.

269
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,958
<i>l'm Hoff-Federated's biggest star.
l'm worth millions a year to them.</i>

270
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,892
<i>He won't let me go. You know why.</i>

271
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,759
<i>Tell him you're leaving Hollywood.</i>

272
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,856
Promise not to make pictures for anyone else.

273
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,060
<i>That's fine. What do l do? TV, a play?</i>

274
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,764
<i>The theater's a bleeding stump.
You've got to wait years for a decent part.</i>

275
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:22,267
And anyhow, what is all this arty bunk?

276
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:25,369
You know this industry is capable
of turning out good pictures...

277
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,141
...pictures with guts and meaning.

278
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:30,309
Sure, sure, you know some of the men who do it.

279
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:34,555
Stevens, Mankiewicz, Kazan, Huston...

280
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:39,560
...Wyler, Wilder, Stanley Kramer,
but never Stanley Hoff!

281
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:42,698
Never! Not once! Not for the life of him!

282
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:45,195
Not for all the pompous press statements!

283
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:49,969
<i>Stanley Hoff will personally produce
War and Peace by Tolstoy!</i>

284
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:51,234
<i>That'll be the day.</i>

285
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:54,038
Starring Charlie Castle
with a bull whip in one hand--

286
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:58,980
And a bleached blonde in the other.

287
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:05,750
Come here, please.

288
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:12,125
<i>Darling, there'll always be
Stanley Hoffs in this world.</i>

289
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:15,724
Not just in the movie industry, everywhere.

290
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:21,462
Always one who just has contempt
for decency and human dignity...

291
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:23,701
...and tries to drag you down with them.

292
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:26,377
Charlie, no.

293
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>l'm Hoff's prisoner, angel,
and signing this contract is the ransom fee.</i>

294
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:34,186
<i>l didn't have the nerve that night.</i>

295
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:39,256
-l made the wrong decision.
-We made the wrong decision that night.

296
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,052
<i>l should've swung the other way.</i>

297
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,858
Darling, we both failed.

298
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,161
<i>l should've snapped out of my self-pity
and shoved you.</i>

299
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:51,896
<i>But we have a second chance.
lt's a gamble, l know.</i>

300
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,135
l know what Hoff can do if you refuse to sign.

301
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:56,643
You think you know.

302
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,572
<i>Charlie, he's only a man.</i>

303
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,650
<i>He's not God, to strike us down in his wrath.</i>

304
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,017
You really want to throw this away?

305
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:15,957
<i>l know l'm talking about your fabulous career
and all that goes with it...</i>

306
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:18,927
...but refuse him, Charlie, turn him down.

307
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,207
<i>l'll try.</i>

308
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:30,069
<i>l haven't actually agreed to sign.
l've been stalling for weeks, for months.</i>

309
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:34,175
<i>And Nat's coming by.
Maybe he can come up with a big idea.</i>

310
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:35,583
<i>l'm very fond of Nat.</i>

311
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:37,153
<i>He's good and kind...</i>

312
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,323
<i>...but you'll have to fight this one by yourself.</i>

313
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,619
lt may not work.

314
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,155
<i>lt's in your hands.</i>

315
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,670
We do love.... l mean....

316
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,737
<i>We do love each other, don't we?</i>

317
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,537
<i>That's the thing, the big thing.</i>

318
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,377
l need you.

319
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,175
l want you to tear Stanley Hoff apart, tiger.

320
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,078
-Hi, Nicky.
-Hello, Marion.

321
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,986
<i>l hope l'm not interrupting anything important.</i>

322
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,788
<i>You are, but it's all right.</i>

323
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,455
<i>lt's time for his rub, Marion.</i>

324
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,361
<i>-That can wait.
-No, it can't.</i>

325
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,024
<i>He'll be right out, Nicky.</i>

326
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:23,535
Tiger, l want you in condition, in the pink.

327
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:27,472
l have a million things to do,
and a household to move by suppertime.

328
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:28,736
-Household?
-Sure.

329
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,202
Me, Billy, the whole shebang.

330
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,948
<i>We're yours, aren't we?</i>

331
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,556
<i>l'll call you later.</i>

332
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,497
See you later.

333
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,459
Goodbye, Tiger.

334
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,059
Goodbye.

335
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,535
<i>Eighth Avenue, Jacob's Beach.</i>

336
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:05,475
<i>You and me, going to St. Nick's.</i>

337
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:06,951
Yeah, sure.

338
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,046
<i>There's your agent.</i>

339
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:12,152
What are you doing there, Nat, old kid?

340
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,415
Gentlemen!

341
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:15,686
What are you doing, Nat? What do you say?

342
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,433
<i>No, l'm greasy, you'll get all dirty.</i>

343
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:25,837
<i>Say, Nat, when l'm through, how about
me working that shoulder of yours?</i>

344
00:21:26,272 --> 00:21:29,708
<i>Nicky, you're a sweetheart,
but the doctor says diathermy and shots.</i>

345
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:31,169
No friction.

346
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,537
Bursitis.

347
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:37,549
<i>What's the fashion in the industry? Ulcers.</i>

348
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:39,009
The rage.

349
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,414
l get bursitis.

350
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:45,416
But thank you, Nicky, you are
a true gentleman for wanting to help.

351
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,294
<i>Water when you're thirsty.</i>

352
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:54,596
Not to digress,
l saw your business manager this morning.

353
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:55,803
Harold?

354
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:59,268
<i>He says you're being a bad boy.
Checks he didn't approve.</i>

355
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:03,242
What am l supposed to do,
ask Eisenhower if l can slip a hungry rider $200?

356
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:05,211
<i>That's the least of my problems.</i>

357
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:08,545
Problems. Life is all problems. They work out.

358
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,447
<i>Well, l've got a honey for you, Nat.</i>

359
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:12,714
<i>Marion's dead set against the contract.</i>

360
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:14,322
<i>Her, l'm going to talk to.</i>

361
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:17,225
<i>You don't have to tell the old man.</i>

362
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:20,388
You two are such sweet mortals.

363
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,693
<i>l know she's a little hectic.</i>

364
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,895
<i>l don't want to sign it.
l'm afraid, if l do, it'll cost me my family.</i>

365
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,030
Look, Marion will cool down, Charlie.

366
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,974
<i>-l'll talk to her and you'll sign the--
-You don't hear one thing l say, do you?</i>

367
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,544
-Nothing.
-Darling, listen.

368
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,410
Listen? Why should l listen?
You never listen to me!

369
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,882
<i>l'm listening now.</i>

370
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:45,820
<i>l don't want to sign the contract!</i>

371
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:48,687
<i>-You don't?
-No, l don't.</i>

372
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:54,326
<i>-l thought you agreed to sign it.
-Listening doesn't mean agreement.</i>

373
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,892
<i>l listen to Stanley, l listen to you,
l listen till l'm blue in the face.</i>

374
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,302
But l did not agree to sign that contract.

375
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,640
<i>l can't keep doing those lousy pictures.</i>

376
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:10,709
<i>But it's in the contract, black on white.
You don't have to.</i>

377
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:14,914
l approve and make sure the scripts are good
before you even see them.

378
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:18,855
<i>This is Charlie ''Been-Around-a-Long-Time''
Castle you're talking to.</i>

379
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,619
Now, come on, give, think me a way out.

380
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:25,599
Well, darling, first l ought to tell you that...

381
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:29,467
...Stanley had me in his office
about the contract this morning...

382
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:32,033
<i>...for two hours, Hail Columbia...</i>

383
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:36,040
<i>...which leads to the fact
that they're dropping in here.</i>

384
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:41,513
-Here?
-Stanley Hoff and Smiley Coy.

385
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:43,913
-When?
-Any minute now.

386
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:47,990
<i>To invite you to the races,
but it's going to be a showdown.</i>

387
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,586
The alcohol.

388
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:53,352
<i>Nat, you've got to get me out of this.</i>

389
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:57,059
<i>Darling, l'm terribly worried.</i>

390
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:01,331
<i>Everybody has got the delusion
that you're very tough.</i>

391
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,104
They mix you up with the parts you play.

392
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,234
But l know you better.

393
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,639
<i>You're a special, idealistic type.</i>

394
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,417
<i>The only thing is,
business and idealism, they don't mix.</i>

395
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,951
<i>lt's oil and water.</i>

396
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:18,586
<i>A movie is not a movie to you, it's a gospel.</i>

397
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:22,251
<i>But you're mistaken, dear sir and friend, in all--</i>

398
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,727
Nat, shut up! Please, shut up!

399
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,355
Nicky, go up to the house. Go up to the house!

400
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:34,566
ls there anything a Greek can do?

401
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,876
Go up to the house, Nicky.
Let me know when they get here.

402
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:45,642
Thanks, character.

403
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:55,218
Charlie, a few important words.

404
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,629
We are not in a bargaining position
with Stanley...

405
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,396
<i>...but l'd do anything you ask me,
within my power...</i>

406
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,266
...as the good Lord sits above.

407
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:05,169
Just get me out of here, Nat.

408
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:07,237
<i>Stanley wouldn't let you go.</i>

409
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,810
Suppose l just tore up the contract,
and we moved away?

410
00:25:12,215 --> 00:25:14,513
-What would he do?
-Yes. What would he do?

411
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,149
God forbid what he would do.

412
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:22,285
<i>Charlie, never underestimate a man
because you don't like him.</i>

413
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,728
l know Stanley since before
he had his fingers manicured every day.

414
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,889
What he would do....

415
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:33,102
<i>We've got no choice, Charlie.</i>

416
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:37,869
<i>You know what he's got on you.
That thing we don't talk about?</i>

417
00:25:41,713 --> 00:25:44,511
You sign, or you go to jail.

418
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:48,144
<i>They're here!</i>

419
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,989
Mr. Hoff and Smiley Coy!

420
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:01,129
Every way is a way to die, huh?

421
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,405
<i>l'm older. Every way is a way to live.</i>

422
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:09,302
<i>l hope you're right, Nat.</i>

423
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:15,346
-Absolutely nothing.
-You know how it is, Mr. Hoff.

424
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,942
You know, some fighters, they get punchy,
so they hear things, but not me.

425
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,448
See you, Nick.

426
00:26:25,426 --> 00:26:28,418
Two heads under one hat. What goes on here?

427
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,191
How are you, Stanley? Smiley?

428
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,567
<i>Nat's in my hair so frequently,
l don't say hello to him.</i>

429
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,535
<i>l didn't expect to find you here, Nat.</i>

430
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:39,233
<i>l just came in out of God's sunshine, that's all.</i>

431
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:42,909
<i>-How'd you wake up this morning, kitty?
-l didn't wake up, l came to.</i>

432
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:46,176
Fifteen minutes under a cold shower
before l could remember my name.

433
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,843
-Did you hear about Joe Ackerman?
-No. What?

434
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:50,746
Cancer.

435
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:55,515
Poor Joe, poor Martha.
l saw them only yesterday.

436
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,320
<i>l'll have to call there tonight.</i>

437
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:59,658
<i>That's a wonderful robe. Where'd you get it?</i>

438
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:02,161
<i>Nick Carroll's, l think.</i>

439
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,668
<i>That's a pleasure to feel next to your skin.</i>

440
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:08,871
-Smiley, you find me a few of those.
-Will do.

441
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:14,338
We request the pleasure of your company
at the races this afternoon.

442
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:18,073
<i>l don't think l can make it, Stanley.</i>

443
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:21,049
<i>l'm ready to bartend,
union regulations permitting.</i>

444
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,120
Stanley?

445
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:25,056
<i>l'll have a little sparkling water, please, Smiley.</i>

446
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,716
<i>Don't be an old fossil.</i>

447
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:29,556
<i>You'd enjoy the afternoon,
and we'd appreciate your company.</i>

448
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:31,789
<i>l'd like to, l really would, Stanley...</i>

449
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:35,896
...but the fact is, some friends from out of town,
friends of Marion--

450
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:39,029
You know how Charlie is,
always giving of himself.

451
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:42,040
<i>Marion, she's a wonderful girl.</i>

452
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:47,477
l hope for your reconciliation with her
as if you both were my own family.

453
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:49,081
Thank you very much.

454
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:52,119
lf we can express the divine will...

455
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,485
...and a happy marriage
is certainly such an expression...

456
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,889
...then we are really beginning
to live beyond our own selfish aims.

457
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,856
<i>That's very sweet of you, Stanley.</i>

458
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:04,398
<i>Since we're here on a friendly conclave,
how about the contract?</i>

459
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:10,404
<i>-Come on, now, it's growing whiskers.
-Well, l'm having trouble with it.</i>

460
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:13,964
<i>Trouble? What sort of trouble?
You tell me, l've got broad shoulders.</i>

461
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:17,043
Charlie, people can speak frankly to me.

462
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:20,547
<i>You're in a position which entitles you
to make the highest demands...</i>

463
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,880
...so, please, tell me your innermost thoughts.

464
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,920
<i>l don't want to sign the contract.</i>

465
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:29,618
-Have you talked this over with Marion?
-Yes.

466
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,198
<i>Well, you're still man and wife.</i>

467
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,764
Tree and bark.

468
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,310
<i>God's put that together, l can understand that.</i>

469
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,809
What does Marion want to see in the contract?

470
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,342
<i>lt isn't just Marion.</i>

471
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:56,382
We talked it over....

472
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,559
<i>l don't want to sign again.</i>

473
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,487
-Stanley, Charlie feels--
-No.

474
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:04,153
No, you let him answer.

475
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:08,760
<i>-Why?
-Well, it's the whole thing, Stanley.</i>

476
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:12,770
The whole idea of signing for that length of time.

477
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:16,573
Stanley, people can always speak
frankly with you...

478
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:19,009
<i>...and that's exactly what Charlie wants to do.</i>

479
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:23,873
What do you propose to do instead?

480
00:29:24,852 --> 00:29:26,753
Well, l want to leave Hollywood.

481
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:30,923
<i>l'll sign anything guaranteeing you
l'll never make pictures again.</i>

482
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:35,755
<i>l've got nothing against you or Hoff-Federated.
lt's just that...</i>

483
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,393
<i>...l'm tired.</i>

484
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,296
l want to go away.

485
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,964
Sure, sure. l understand.

486
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:52,237
<i>l'll tell you what, you go on a layoff.
Six months, a year even.</i>

487
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:54,543
No, l want to go for good.

488
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,127
l see.

489
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:08,457
Charlie Castle, l easily recall to mind...

490
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:10,830
...our first meeting many, many years ago.

491
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:12,970
Do you remember what l said at that time?

492
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,868
Yes, some of the things.

493
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,673
<i>Please, you'll excuse me
for speaking with my eyes closed...</i>

494
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,745
...but it helps me see better.

495
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,445
<i>''l see a raw youth...</i>

496
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,212
<i>''...filled with that special vitality of talent.''</i>

497
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,856
l says, if memory serves:

498
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,592
<i>''Charlie Cass, you're going to be one
of the biggest stars in this business.</i>

499
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:38,493
<i>''Sure as there are little green apples...</i>

500
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:41,032
<i>''...you're going to run into
many, many problems.</i>

501
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:44,594
<i>''That's what l'm here for,'' l says.</i>

502
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:49,142
<i>''My advice is free, given with pleasure.</i>

503
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:52,671
<i>''l may not always be able to help...</i>

504
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:56,680
<i>''...but probably more than not.''</i>

505
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:09,890
You came to see me more than once.

506
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,861
-True?
-Yes, true, true.

507
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:19,097
Stanley, Charlie has always had
great respect for your judgment.

508
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:20,639
Adulation, even.

509
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:24,636
<i>l'm skipping the years of coolness between us.</i>

510
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:29,276
You came to my office no more.
The reason why, l never will understand.

511
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,548
But nevertheless, l was there for you and yours...

512
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:36,649
...and the vexing problems that are
so manifold in the heat and toil of the day.

513
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:41,890
Then, on a certain night, in this very room,
the law spelled scandal.

514
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,368
l was there for you then, too.

515
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,434
Charlie, l want to tell you a little story.

516
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,240
<i>Charles, l'd like to tell you a little story.
lt may concern you.</i>

517
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,343
For a number of years...

518
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,978
...the woman that was my wife....

519
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,557
Certain facts came home to me.
That was the year of the merger.

520
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,525
These facts came up, as l said.

521
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,692
My wife...

522
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,300
...drinking...

523
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,400
...certain scenes...

524
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:21,363
...certain hotel room in New York City...

525
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,209
...attempted suicides.

526
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,046
l was out of my mind.

527
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:29,273
But we brought her back that time.

528
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:32,743
Smiley was good enough
to enter my employ the year before.

529
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:35,788
lt all added up to one fact!

530
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,117
Psychoanalysis! Psychoanalysis!

531
00:32:40,863 --> 00:32:45,527
$30,000 or $40,000 down the drain in one year,
but not begrudged.

532
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:52,441
<i>l thought to amuse her.
l bought her a pleasure boat, the Alberta.</i>

533
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,177
Named after her, too.

534
00:32:57,514 --> 00:33:00,244
Nothing helped. Nothing.

535
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:05,749
Then one day in my office,
Frank Lubner was there...

536
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:08,290
...a pioneer in the industry, Smiley Coy...

537
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:13,921
...l drank a light scotch and soda,
and l began to cry.

538
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,691
<i>And l hadn't cried like that since l was a boy.</i>

539
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:22,905
Because l saw, through a revelation of pain,
that my wife was determined...

540
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:26,341
...in her innermost mind
to destroy me and my career...

541
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:29,380
...out of willful, malicious jealousy.

542
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:32,216
You ask me why? l ask you why.

543
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:34,912
But from that day on...

544
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:37,622
...l realized one essential fact of life!

545
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:40,155
<i>The woman must stay out
of her husband's work...</i>

546
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,420
...when he earns her bread and butter.

547
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:56,309
The wife of a man in your position...

548
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,338
...should have the regard...

549
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:04,543
...and should have the respect
to help him advance his career.

550
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:06,850
<i>Don't you think?</i>

551
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:14,588
Charlie, you can have anything l own.

552
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,657
The pain of this moment...

553
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,429
...the memories....

554
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:28,175
l understand how you feel.

555
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:34,541
Gentlemen...

556
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,212
...l apologize.

557
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,484
We understand, Stanley.

558
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:45,453
Hear me, Stanley.

559
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:49,124
<i>Charlie's main worry in the past,
and it's a commendable thing in itself...</i>

560
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:50,792
...he wants to make better pictures.

561
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:53,531
<i>l meant what l said.
l'm not bargaining with you, Stanley.</i>

562
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,903
<i>You're not in a bargaining position!</i>

563
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:58,306
<i>But it's true, l can't force you to sign, can l?</i>

564
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,173
<i>That's just what you're trying to do!</i>

565
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,439
Shut up, Nat!

566
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:09,177
<i>l'm going to have to take this very much amiss.</i>

567
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:13,583
l offer you my hand, and you spit in my face.

568
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,217
No, no, Stanley, Charlie--

569
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,196
<i>Stanley, l want you to let me go.
We don't like each other.</i>

570
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:20,757
l know that, you know it.

571
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,996
<i>l'll promise you anything you want
if you'll just let me go.</i>

572
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,067
Stanley, please, listen to him.

573
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:28,607
<i>He's asking this from the bottom of his soul.</i>

574
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:30,110
Shut up!

575
00:35:32,948 --> 00:35:36,076
Charles, l solemnly adjure realism.

576
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:41,250
l need your physical presence on the lot.

577
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,927
l need your body, not your goodwill.

578
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:48,687
Now, Charlie, l want you to sign this paper...

579
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:51,699
...with one of the pens that ended World War ll.

580
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:56,095
This was used by a great American,
General Douglas MacArthur.

581
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,745
<i>l can't tell you how many long months
of constructive dreaming...</i>

582
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,408
...have gone in this moment...

583
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,956
...and l will let nobody, or nothing,
stand in the way of that dream.

584
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:15,622
<i>l'm asking you for the last time...</i>

585
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:18,526
...please, let me go.

586
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,565
<i>l can't force you to sign, can l?</i>

587
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:30,775
Can l?

588
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,169
Congratulations, kitty.

589
00:36:58,606 --> 00:37:00,437
<i>The copy's Charlie's.</i>

590
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:05,341
<i>l'll keep the pen.</i>

591
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:09,049
<i>lt's my only proof that the war is over...</i>

592
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,414
...or that it was ever fought.

593
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:15,419
Charles, we all love you.

594
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,922
<i>You're a great artist, so we must learn
to expect these temperamental actions.</i>

595
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,028
From now on, Charlie,
your problems are my problems.

596
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,801
Never hesitate to call.
Your slightest wish, your worry....

597
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:32,067
<i>What's with you tonight, kitty?</i>

598
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:35,334
A certain party finds itself very fascinated.

599
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:41,379
<i>Yeah, but like l said, l'm all tied up.</i>

600
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,887
Sure, kitty.

601
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:50,252
<i>-Nat, l'm driving by your office.
-No, thank you, l'm going to Culver City.</i>

602
00:38:01,374 --> 00:38:02,534
Goodbye, Nat.

603
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:07,537
Darling, l know how you feel.

604
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,279
The old man knows.

605
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:15,386
He twisted my neck like l was a 10-cent rag doll.

606
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:18,655
<i>lt's not so terrible as you're making out.</i>

607
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,484
Like l was a little rag doll.

608
00:38:22,796 --> 00:38:26,288
<i>You're making a whole tsimmes
out of a simple basic fact.</i>

609
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:28,759
Seven years of financial security.

610
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:33,939
Darling, take the long view.

611
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,178
What could l do?

612
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,867
See you, Nat.

613
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:02,966
Hello?

614
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:07,274
Sure, Marion. Right here.

615
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,396
Hello, angel.

616
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,702
Marion, wait.

617
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:41,342
l think you ought to know, Hoff was here.

618
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:44,083
l lost.

619
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:46,444
Yes, that....

620
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:48,820
Hello?

621
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,635
Drinking by yourself, Charlie? Secret vices?

622
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:09,304
Look what the wind blew in. Mrs. Bliss.

623
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,877
<i>lsn't Buddy here? His secretary said he was.</i>

624
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,881
-l need a drink, Charlie.
-Help yourself.

625
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:34,062
-Marion still at the beach?
-Yeah.

626
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:41,974
You should keep your door locked, Charlie.

627
00:41:42,143 --> 00:41:45,010
You could be kidnapped
and held for a delicious ransom.

628
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:52,416
<i>l think l'll have some Tequila.
Tequila always makes me frisky.</i>

629
00:41:52,822 --> 00:41:54,881
You want some more Tequila, Charlie?

630
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:58,956
-Where did you come from, frisky miss?
-Lunch at Pescotti.

631
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,363
With that second-class neurotic, Walden?

632
00:42:02,465 --> 00:42:05,435
<i>-How'd you know?
-Small town.</i>

633
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:12,740
My baby.

634
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:24,320
Right here.

635
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:29,424
<i>You've cornered me at 20 different parties.</i>

636
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:32,355
<i>Why do you always sniff me out when l'm drunk?</i>

637
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:36,628
-Are you drunk, Charlie?
-Stewed to the gills.

638
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:42,935
The red neon lights are on
and the sky is full of drunken blackbirds.

639
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,408
So drink your drink and get out of here.

640
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:53,211
Why stand on formality, Charlie?
l find you very attractive.

641
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:57,788
<i>You don't care
what you do to your husband, do you?</i>

642
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:59,757
Do you?

643
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,321
That hurts, boyfriend. You hurt me, darling.

644
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,796
<i>l'm a naughty girl.
l wish l could say l didn't like it.</i>

645
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:12,336
Go home, Connie.

646
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,032
Your mother wants you.

647
00:43:19,214 --> 00:43:22,342
<i>Life's a sweet thing, isn't it, Charlie?</i>

648
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:25,986
<i>That's something Buddy will never understand.</i>

649
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:27,386
Look, l like Buddy.

650
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:30,957
Last year, l almost left Buddy.

651
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:37,430
But then that terrible thing came up...

652
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,729
...and, of course, l had to play my part...

653
00:43:39,837 --> 00:43:43,000
...especially since it all got so involved.

654
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:47,543
<i>-What do you mean, ''involved''?
-Stop it, Charlie.</i>

655
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:51,477
<i>Don't you think l know
that Buddy went to prison for you?</i>

656
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:55,383
<i>Don't you think l know that
you killed that child in the auto accident...</i>

657
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:56,745
...not Buddy?

658
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,384
Buddy told you that?

659
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:06,324
<i>You're the hero of the world to Buddy.
He'd go to prison for you, but tell his wife?</i>

660
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:12,768
No, that handsome Smiley Coy
called twice that night.

661
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:17,664
<i>He's very important.
Now, why would he call Buddy?</i>

662
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:22,477
-So l just put two and two together--
-And you got a crooked five.

663
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,916
<i>Get organized, Charlie. You're drunk.</i>

664
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:29,648
l know, l know.

665
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:34,592
<i>That's when l come around,
and then there's me and what you said:</i>

666
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:40,132
<i>''Red neon lights
and a sky full of drunken blackbirds.''</i>

667
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:49,139
<i>This liquor's got me in a hurry.</i>

668
00:44:52,214 --> 00:44:54,580
<i>Don't fight it, darling.</i>

669
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:57,411
Get with it.

670
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:12,528
Hello?

671
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:26,543
<i>Gee, l don't know, Buddy.</i>

672
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,950
<i>What makes you think that she'd be here?</i>

673
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:35,320
<i>lt's early yet.</i>

674
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:40,163
She could be out in a store somewhere
squandering your loot.

675
00:45:43,536 --> 00:45:45,504
<i>Don't just sit in the house, Ace.</i>

676
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:49,671
Get out, find yourself a bar, sauce up.

677
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,177
Sure.

678
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:57,046
<i>That's Dr. Castle's prescription
for the blue grumps anytime.</i>

679
00:46:01,288 --> 00:46:03,779
<i>No, wait, Buddy. No, you can't come here.</i>

680
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:07,885
<i>l'm going out in about two minutes.
l've got to see a fellow.</i>

681
00:46:13,468 --> 00:46:16,494
<i>Look, she'll probably walk in
as soon as l hang up...</i>

682
00:46:16,604 --> 00:46:18,595
...which is going to be right now.

683
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:21,636
<i>No, don't thank me, Buddy.</i>

684
00:46:23,245 --> 00:46:24,712
Yeah, l know.

685
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,812
<i>Oh, yes, l know, l know. l know l'm a swell guy!</i>

686
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:30,315
Get out of here!

687
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:37,116
You hurt me again, darling.

688
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,696
<i>But you like that, don't you?</i>

689
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,765
<i>There's a word for you.</i>

690
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,933
<i>Why don't you say it, darling?</i>

691
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,939
<i>-You'd better get out of here before l--
-l know.</i>

692
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,945
l know, l know.

693
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,477
Look, what are you?

694
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,517
No, l mean, seriously.

695
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:07,185
Just what do you believe in? What?

696
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,328
Fun, Charlie, not gloomy thoughts.

697
00:47:13,766 --> 00:47:15,529
Perfume and staying young...

698
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:19,598
...and goodies of every sort
and description...

699
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:24,234
...secrets and locked doors...

700
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:29,072
...and enjoying the wildest things
that come into my mind.

701
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:44,758
<i>Why don't you go home, Connie?
Your mother's looking for you.</i>

702
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:50,102
<i>l'll go home, Charlie, in a little while.</i>

703
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:51,729
ln a little while.

704
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,470
You do that, you do that little thing,
because l have big trouble.

705
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:57,842
<i>l don't need you for more trouble.</i>

706
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:02,010
Getting sloshed in my own mud and neon lights.

707
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:51,237
-Hello, Marion.
-Hi, Nicky.

708
00:48:52,072 --> 00:48:55,200
<i>lt's all right, but don't be too long.
He has to have his lunch.</i>

709
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:58,710
-Billy, see you later.
-Goodbye.

710
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,861
-He got over his cold okay, huh?
-Last week.

711
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:20,732
-l called you six or seven times.
-l know.

712
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:24,399
You buried me deep, angel.

713
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:27,904
Listen, would you do me a big favor?

714
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,841
-What?
-Come to dinner tonight.

715
00:49:30,413 --> 00:49:32,711
-You mean at the house?
-Yeah.

716
00:49:34,517 --> 00:49:36,712
l have to do something for Buddy.

717
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:39,287
<i>He's been avoiding me
since that Patty Benedict bit.</i>

718
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:42,291
<i>He thinks he let me down or something.
l don't know.</i>

719
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:45,054
<i>He's in trouble with the front office.</i>

720
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:48,457
Hank asked me to have dinner with him tonight.

721
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:51,857
Well, bring him along.

722
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:56,874
<i>-l've invited the Blisses for 7:00.
-All right, we'll be there at 6:30.</i>

723
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:03,503
<i>Because l'm coming to dinner at the house,
it doesn't mean anything.</i>

724
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:05,114
Natch.

725
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:11,248
All right, into your corner.

726
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:13,648
...three, four...

727
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:17,057
...five, six...

728
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,631
<i>...seven, eight, nine....</i>

729
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,708
<i>Come on, break it up.</i>

730
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:38,285
<i>Break it up.</i>

731
00:50:56,004 --> 00:50:57,972
<i>Nine, ten and you're out.</i>

732
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:22,492
That was a great picture, huh, boy?

733
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,796
Hey, Charlie, who was that guy? Was that Cass?

734
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:28,133
Yeah. Ralph was referee, too, remember.

735
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,209
<i>Who's drink wants sweetening?
Marion? Connie?</i>

736
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,741
<i>Hank, why don't you break down?</i>

737
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:36,211
<i>lt's getting so l almost like this stuff.</i>

738
00:51:36,314 --> 00:51:38,805
<i>Hey, aren't we all going next door
to Monty's party?</i>

739
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:41,750
<i>Connie, you'll have to excuse me.
l've got a rotten headache.</i>

740
00:51:41,853 --> 00:51:43,549
Oh, what a shame.

741
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:46,819
<i>Yeah, you kids run along.
Maybe we'll catch up with you later.</i>

742
00:51:46,993 --> 00:51:48,221
Okay, handsome.

743
00:51:49,228 --> 00:51:50,855
-Should we walk or drive?
-Drive.

744
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:55,059
Leave a lot of cars out front,
and the drunks will be dropping in all night.

745
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:57,864
-How old is that picture?
-Eight, nine years.

746
00:51:57,971 --> 00:51:59,768
-Why?
-Hey, you had a lot of steam.

747
00:51:59,873 --> 00:52:01,204
He certainly did.

748
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:05,573
-See you later, faithless.
-Faithless?

749
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,478
Thanks, Charles.

750
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:10,142
-Good night, Marion.
-Good night, Connie.

751
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:12,650
-Good night, Hank.
-Good night.

752
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,816
What did you think of the picture, Hank?

753
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,054
<i>l kept wondering what would've happened
if you lost the big fight.</i>

754
00:52:21,162 --> 00:52:25,122
<i>Un-commercial. Kid still thinks
he's writing for Mercury and the group...</i>

755
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:29,132
<i>...but it turned out
to what Uncle Hoff described as ''disahster.''</i>

756
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,405
What did you think of it?

757
00:52:31,507 --> 00:52:34,374
l liked it the first time, in spite of the ending.

758
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:36,944
Well, you grieve for the past like a weeping bird.

759
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:39,309
When are you leaving, Hank?

760
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:41,817
l mean, leaving Hollywood.

761
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:43,078
Tuesday or Wednesday.

762
00:52:43,186 --> 00:52:46,417
<i>l'd like to see you before you go.
How about Monday?</i>

763
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,251
-Any time you say.
-Okay, Monday.

764
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:55,055
<i>-What are you doing?
-Hank's driving me back to the beach.</i>

765
00:52:57,568 --> 00:53:00,969
<i>Do you have to go now?
l mean, it's early, 12:30 or so.</i>

766
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:03,632
<i>Can't we sit down and talk or something?</i>

767
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:06,370
<i>l'm sorry, Charlie, but you know where that leads.</i>

768
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:07,873
Darling....

769
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,808
<i>l thought maybe the three of us,
we'd just sit around and yack it up a bit.</i>

770
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:14,146
<i>Please, don't go.</i>

771
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:17,517
<i>Look, if you want to yack it up,
why don't you go over to Monty's?</i>

772
00:53:17,623 --> 00:53:20,616
<i>-There's lots of bright types there for you.
-Take it easy, dear.</i>

773
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,695
<i>Take it easy? That's where the trouble began.</i>

774
00:53:22,795 --> 00:53:24,126
Come on, now, be yourself.

775
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,394
<i>That's another local remark, which means,
''Be just like me, don't be yourself.''</i>

776
00:53:28,935 --> 00:53:32,736
<i>-Stay and have just one more drink.
-l don't need another one, thanks.</i>

777
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,769
-Hank, how about another cup of coffee?
-No thanks, Charlie, up to here.

778
00:53:38,912 --> 00:53:42,780
<i>Did you ever hear Smiley's story
about the coffee bean and the water plant?</i>

779
00:53:51,192 --> 00:53:53,592
Marion tells me that you asked her to marry you.

780
00:53:55,296 --> 00:53:56,263
Yes, l did.

781
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:58,392
Let me get this straight.

782
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:00,727
<i>-Aren't you my friend?
-Yes, Charlie--</i>

783
00:54:00,836 --> 00:54:02,497
Then what is this routine?

784
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:07,271
Marion makes me want to live.

785
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,801
Most people affect me differently.

786
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:13,946
<i>Look, Charlie, l'm sorry you're unhappy,
but you lost her years ago.</i>

787
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,643
<i>ln fairness, you can't blame me.</i>

788
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,721
<i>l don't feel fair tonight.
Where did you stash your angel wings?</i>

789
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,017
Who gave you the right to make such a decision?

790
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,752
My only right is to make my own decisions.

791
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,387
That speech is right off the couch.

792
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:30,365
<i>Get this straight, dreamboy.
Marion isn't going to leave me.</i>

793
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,128
l make my own decisions, too.

794
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,062
No, l want to go home.

795
00:54:34,172 --> 00:54:36,106
Marion, would you let me say 10 words?

796
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:38,742
<i>l think it'll be easier if l wait in the car.</i>

797
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:55,485
<i>l'm sorry.</i>

798
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,694
Sometimes l rant and rave
as though l had something against you.

799
00:55:01,434 --> 00:55:03,959
<i>But you've been good to me, so good to me.</i>

800
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:06,964
<i>You're only good to me.</i>

801
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:17,779
This is all a bleak, bitter dream...

802
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:21,447
...a real dish of doves.

803
00:55:22,457 --> 00:55:27,190
You come in here and throw this nest of
naked pigeons in my face, what can l do?

804
00:55:27,729 --> 00:55:29,720
There are only two ways to forget everything.

805
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:32,766
You either get drunk,
or you just stick a pencil in your eye.

806
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:36,202
<i>Charlie, l'm seeing a lawyer in the morning.</i>

807
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:40,072
<i>Marion, please, don't leave me.</i>

808
00:55:43,279 --> 00:55:45,042
<i>l swear, l'm innocent, angel.</i>

809
00:55:45,348 --> 00:55:49,285
<i>l swear that while l'm charming the world
with my light fantastic...</i>

810
00:55:50,621 --> 00:55:52,885
<i>...l'm bleeding to death under my shirt.</i>

811
00:55:57,094 --> 00:55:59,426
<i>Can't you wait with the lawyer, angel?</i>

812
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:04,024
Am l the worst oaf in the world?

813
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:06,928
<i>The world's a big place.</i>

814
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:10,440
<i>You're the worst one in my life.</i>

815
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:32,063
Thank you.

816
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,298
Do want me to take you back?

817
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:41,365
Marion, you know l love you.

818
00:56:41,475 --> 00:56:43,340
<i>l'll do anything for your happiness...</i>

819
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:46,242
...but please, stop playing both ends
against the middle.

820
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:47,944
<i>l don't mean to.</i>

821
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,241
<i>Then let's face the basic problem.</i>

822
00:56:53,387 --> 00:56:55,253
lt boils down to a simple fact.

823
00:56:56,558 --> 00:56:59,550
Either you still love him
and you want to live with him...

824
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:02,856
<i>...or you don't love him
and you don't want to live with him.</i>

825
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:09,530
<i>Charlie, please, don't worry. lt'll all work out.</i>

826
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:14,668
-Nicky, do me a favor.
-Sure, Charlie.

827
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:17,509
Get me my robe and a blanket.

828
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:23,314
<i>-l don't want to sleep up there tonight.
-Sure.</i>

829
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:32,922
<i>lf you're in trouble...</i>

830
00:57:33,397 --> 00:57:37,459
<i>...if there's anything old Nick can do,
anything....</i>

831
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:39,768
Anybody home?

832
00:57:41,172 --> 00:57:43,402
<i>l don't hear a thing, not a thing.</i>

833
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:46,873
Where did you come from? Next door?

834
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:49,911
Yeah. Monty Ritz. A real bash.

835
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:53,843
<i>-Funny, you couldn't hear it in here.
-Marion had the door closed.</i>

836
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:57,021
lt sounds wild.

837
00:57:57,123 --> 00:57:59,114
All the types. You know Monty.

838
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,984
Busted with the girls?

839
00:58:01,762 --> 00:58:02,854
Everything.

840
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,262
-How you feeling, kitty?
-Blue.

841
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,227
<i>Like my dear baby's eyes.</i>

842
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,361
-What did you think of Tess?
-Tess?

843
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:16,067
-Last night.
-Oh, the redhead.

844
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:18,407
She was built, but....

845
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:22,512
<i>l don't know, l wasn't in the mood.
l think l lost a fan.</i>

846
00:58:23,318 --> 00:58:25,149
l came home and read for an hour.

847
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:29,122
<i>-What are you reading?
-l don't remember from one day to another.</i>

848
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:33,118
<i>l saw Tommy Murdock's new picture
this afternoon.</i>

849
00:58:33,362 --> 00:58:36,229
-Yeah, how was it?
-Disaster.

850
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:41,770
Cards or chess, or shall l take
another $100 from you in Scrabble?

851
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,733
<i>No, let's sit this one out.</i>

852
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:46,938
What are you dreaming about?

853
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,743
<i>l'm homesick for the east, the four seasons.</i>

854
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:55,344
-How old are you, Smiley?
-A million.

855
00:58:57,355 --> 00:58:59,346
But young enough, to my surprise...

856
00:58:59,457 --> 00:59:02,551
...to still be losing my temper
with a tramp like Dixie Evans.

857
00:59:05,162 --> 00:59:07,722
<i>-What's wrong now?
-Her mouth's too big.</i>

858
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:11,331
<i>She's over at Monty's party, drunk.</i>

859
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:13,202
<i>''There he is,'' she says.</i>

860
00:59:13,372 --> 00:59:17,035
l turn around, and there she sits,
cute as a skinned parboiled ham.

861
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:20,840
<i>''We know something, Smiley and me, don't we?''
she says.</i>

862
00:59:21,913 --> 00:59:24,348
<i>l've been trying to get Marion
to come back to me.</i>

863
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,849
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

864
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:30,150
<i>That's all l need, for her to find out
l had a girl in the car the night of the accident.</i>

865
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:32,724
<i>Dixie's been hinting like that
in quite a few spots.</i>

866
00:59:32,925 --> 00:59:35,917
-You think she means any harm?
-Who knows? Harm.

867
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:38,992
<i>She's always liked you, kitty.</i>

868
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,497
Call her up, have her come over. Laugh a little.

869
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:42,694
Are you worried?

870
00:59:42,803 --> 00:59:46,295
What have you got to be worried about?
You can do a thousand things.

871
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:47,565
Name one.

872
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:49,970
-Buy her off.
-We did, with a contract.

873
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:53,440
<i>She's dishonest. She won't stay bought.</i>

874
00:59:54,682 --> 00:59:57,617
-Call her over, kitty.
-All right.

875
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,856
Anything for my art.

876
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,624
Women, women, women.

877
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,027
<i>lt's Monty's little girl singing.</i>

878
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:12,025
Nice voice.

879
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:13,967
You should see her.

880
01:00:14,503 --> 01:00:15,470
Cute?

881
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,164
A barracuda.

882
01:00:18,675 --> 01:00:22,668
Hello? ls Miss Dixie Evans there?

883
01:00:24,614 --> 01:00:27,845
Evans. Yes. Would you get her, please?

884
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,583
<i>Sounds like they're shooting off guns
or something.</i>

885
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,657
Bongos.

886
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:37,090
-A lot of women there?
-Loaded.

887
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,555
What do you think of women, kitty?

888
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:44,235
<i>There's room in the world for them.</i>

889
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:46,671
Dixie?

890
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,835
<i>l can't hear you. Who?</i>

891
01:00:54,646 --> 01:00:58,447
<i>Really? You're not ribbing me?</i>

892
01:00:58,952 --> 01:01:00,749
Knock it off, will you, honey?

893
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:02,412
No, not you, Charlie.

894
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:04,080
<i>There's somebody here with me.</i>

895
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,159
<i>Sure, it's a great party. Yeah, yeah.</i>

896
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,352
<i>There's so much noise here.</i>

897
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:11,761
<i>-Would you please get him to stop?
-lt's all right.</i>

898
01:01:11,866 --> 01:01:15,893
<i>-No, l have a very important call.
-lt's all right, honey, he'll be quiet.</i>

899
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,505
Gee, Charlie, a swim in your pool now?

900
01:01:20,608 --> 01:01:21,666
<i>l'd love to.</i>

901
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:23,470
Listen, how do l get there?

902
01:01:23,844 --> 01:01:24,743
Yeah?

903
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:27,675
Look, will you cut it out, please, honey?

904
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,918
<i>Look, l'll take Monty's car.</i>

905
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:34,180
Yeah, you know l never walk anywhere.

906
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:36,616
Yeah, right away. Pronto.

907
01:01:36,725 --> 01:01:37,852
<i>l'd love to.</i>

908
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,762
Of all the types!

909
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:46,331
<i>The first nice thing that's happened to me
in a month of Tuesdays.</i>

910
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,075
Bye, honey.

911
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:57,242
<i>Be careful what you say to Dixie, Charlie.
Don't give her any more ammunition.</i>

912
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,747
Listen, have you offered to buy her contract up?

913
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,818
Two months ago. Nothing.

914
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,449
<i>-You mean she's been blabbing that long?
-Longer.</i>

915
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:11,183
The stupid little tramp.
Two bits worth of nothing with a little power.

916
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:14,732
<i>-She doesn't want more money?
-She doesn't know what she wants.</i>

917
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:17,330
<i>l'm betting even money, we have to get rid of her.</i>

918
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:19,461
Fine. How do you work that?

919
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:35,516
-Good night, Charlie.
-Good night.

920
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:41,483
How do you work that?

921
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:44,030
<i>There's no standard procedure.</i>

922
01:02:44,197 --> 01:02:45,995
What do you do, ship her east?

923
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,101
<i>Charlie, she's all mouth, all gab.</i>

924
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:53,267
<i>So we've got to get it fixed
she never opens her mouth again.</i>

925
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:56,873
<i>Well, let's wait and see the developments.</i>

926
01:02:57,211 --> 01:02:59,112
l think l can talk to her.

927
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,978
<i>l'm a little fuzzy tonight.</i>

928
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:10,820
<i>You know, you're saying funny things, Smiley,
but l don't see you smiling.</i>

929
01:03:11,326 --> 01:03:13,887
<i>What do you mean,
''she never opens her mouth again?''</i>

930
01:03:14,564 --> 01:03:16,623
<i>-That's it.
-What's it?</i>

931
01:03:18,434 --> 01:03:20,459
<i>Charlie, she'll have to be removed.</i>

932
01:03:21,938 --> 01:03:22,905
Removed?

933
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:25,905
Sorry to throw the raw meat on the floor.

934
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:29,613
A fact, like a rock,
has certain dimensions and gravity.

935
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,214
<i>l've gone over all the choices, one by one.</i>

936
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:36,946
<i>You'd make a great actor.</i>

937
01:03:38,122 --> 01:03:41,388
<i>-Life's a queer little man, kitty.
-Yeah, kitty.</i>

938
01:03:42,827 --> 01:03:46,092
-What does Stanley know about this?
-Only what he wants to know.

939
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:49,627
<i>There's a reason he pays me $75,000 a year.</i>

940
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:56,838
<i>-You know, for a minute there, l thought--
-Charles, you're a fanciful type.</i>

941
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,608
ln my end of the business,
you have to know types.

942
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,009
Take your type.

943
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:04,708
The warrior minstrel with a forlorn hope.

944
01:04:05,951 --> 01:04:07,544
<i>That's you, doll.</i>

945
01:04:08,121 --> 01:04:10,089
<i>That's Dixie. l'll slide out the back way.</i>

946
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,724
<i>''Warrior minstrel with the forlorn hope.''
Wait.</i>

947
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,457
<i>What's that from?</i>

948
01:04:15,162 --> 01:04:17,494
<i>lt's a phrase the lrish used to understand.</i>

949
01:04:17,597 --> 01:04:20,465
<i>You know me, l'm from those cynical Celts.</i>

950
01:04:21,502 --> 01:04:23,663
ldeals, kitty? Nowadays?

951
01:04:25,473 --> 01:04:26,997
A lost crusade.

952
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:31,478
<i>Don't study life, Charlie. Get used to it.</i>

953
01:04:32,513 --> 01:04:34,106
You changed the subject.

954
01:04:34,216 --> 01:04:36,912
You bothering to remember
everything l said tonight?

955
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:39,544
Pleasant dreams, kitty.

956
01:04:43,692 --> 01:04:44,784
Smiley, listen....

957
01:04:57,173 --> 01:04:59,767
<i>The door wasn't locked, so l walked right in.</i>

958
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:01,868
Long time, no see, Charlie.

959
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,575
Well, wash my mouth out with whiskey.

960
01:05:17,028 --> 01:05:18,461
<i>l'm drinking brandy.</i>

961
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:21,989
<i>lf l take one more drink, l'll see a snake.</i>

962
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:30,638
<i>Take a light one. Don't be silly.</i>

963
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:33,507
All right, you masochist.

964
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:36,977
Give me a scotch and soda.

965
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,117
l know.

966
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:46,658
<i>How did you know l was at Monty's party?</i>

967
01:05:47,928 --> 01:05:48,895
Radar.

968
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:50,762
<i>Oh, you're a faker.</i>

969
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:53,796
<i>You're very sweet, but l don't trust you.</i>

970
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:56,930
Listen.

971
01:05:57,572 --> 01:05:59,767
<i>-Who's at home?
-Only the crickets.</i>

972
01:06:02,977 --> 01:06:06,413
<i>-Why don't you like me anymore?
-l like you, Dixie.</i>

973
01:06:07,015 --> 01:06:09,678
<i>l haven't seen you since that very day...</i>

974
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:12,783
...l sat in this here chair with you
and your agents.

975
01:06:12,888 --> 01:06:15,482
Then l shocked them
when l asked for my contract.

976
01:06:16,492 --> 01:06:18,323
<i>Old Nat's been around, honey.</i>

977
01:06:18,894 --> 01:06:20,521
And that whole big studio...

978
01:06:20,629 --> 01:06:23,599
...when l think of some of the things
they do and say....

979
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:24,956
Such as?

980
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:30,037
<i>You've got to be a girl
with a good figure to know.</i>

981
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:33,438
And some of those guys on a rainy afternoon....

982
01:06:34,311 --> 01:06:36,007
<i>l'd like to brain them.</i>

983
01:06:38,649 --> 01:06:41,516
<i>Did you know that l'm perfectly proportioned?</i>

984
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:43,586
<i>-Well, aren't l?
-Yes.</i>

985
01:06:44,055 --> 01:06:47,354
Of course, l understand now
that temperament is much more important...

986
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:48,892
...than shape and size.

987
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:51,120
<i>But it's like l still won't get glasses.</i>

988
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,925
<i>You know, l can't see across the street.
But glasses are ugly, aren't they?</i>

989
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,533
Who wound me up?

990
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:02,866
<i>So why don't l see you more often
in my young and thrilling life?</i>

991
01:07:02,976 --> 01:07:06,070
<i>Here, have a shot of Dr. Castle's pain killer.</i>

992
01:07:07,247 --> 01:07:08,680
Snake oil.

993
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,618
<i>l don't care if l do see a snake.</i>

994
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,952
<i>l'm sure l'd much rather see a snake
than a Hollywood producer.</i>

995
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,660
Who invented soda? How do they make it?

996
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:23,823
What a weirdie.

997
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:26,762
<i>You're the only one who can call me that.</i>

998
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,366
<i>l'll tell you why.</i>

999
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:30,536
l like you, Charlie.

1000
01:07:31,439 --> 01:07:33,805
<i>You've been very kind and considerate to me.</i>

1001
01:07:34,376 --> 01:07:38,278
And that is a very special matter
in my special memory box.

1002
01:07:41,483 --> 01:07:43,452
<i>l'm going to get a dog.</i>

1003
01:07:43,986 --> 01:07:44,953
A poodle.

1004
01:07:46,589 --> 01:07:47,954
Do you like poodles?

1005
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:49,783
Big or little?

1006
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:51,754
<i>l'll tell you why.</i>

1007
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:55,791
When l was 16,
my family threw me out of the house.

1008
01:07:56,934 --> 01:07:58,424
That makes you very nervous.

1009
01:07:58,735 --> 01:08:01,226
l mean a thing like that makes you very touchy.

1010
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:04,900
They just kind of gave me up for lost.

1011
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:11,145
<i>To this very day, my mother can't tell my father
that l send them money.</i>

1012
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,514
Catholics believe in large families.

1013
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,954
<i>But l'll tell you what. l'm saving my money now.</i>

1014
01:08:18,122 --> 01:08:20,386
<i>l'm waiting for Mr. Right to come along.</i>

1015
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:23,085
lf l ever meet the guy around here.

1016
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:26,764
My name is mud in Hollywood.

1017
01:08:27,766 --> 01:08:30,929
-Hey, am l boring you?
-No, honey, no.

1018
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,735
l like to hear you talk honest.

1019
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,139
<i>l know what you're trying to do, Charlie.</i>

1020
01:08:37,444 --> 01:08:38,502
What?

1021
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:41,880
Make me forget about the swim you promised me.

1022
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:45,950
<i>They'd drown me if they could, that studio.</i>

1023
01:08:46,753 --> 01:08:47,981
Why?

1024
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:51,023
l needle them.

1025
01:08:51,258 --> 01:08:55,592
l keep hinting about your accident.
lt makes them nervous for a change.

1026
01:08:55,696 --> 01:08:57,129
You want to be careful.

1027
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:00,028
<i>Hoff's a man with a crocodile's temper.</i>

1028
01:09:01,535 --> 01:09:03,504
<i>Don't tell me about Mr. Hoff.</i>

1029
01:09:04,606 --> 01:09:08,133
Calling me a child one minute,
and without even changing his face....

1030
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:14,009
<i>You don't see those people
from the bottom, like l do, Charlie.</i>

1031
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:17,650
<i>You're a successful self-made man.</i>

1032
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:21,489
<i>Why don't you give me a break, please?</i>

1033
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,918
Sure, Charlie, dear. How?

1034
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:27,790
Every time that you talk
about the accident, you know--

1035
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,364
<i>Charlie, don't be like that.</i>

1036
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:33,399
You have nothing to be afraid of from me.

1037
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,395
<i>l don't talk in my sleep.</i>

1038
01:09:36,974 --> 01:09:39,101
<i>-So don't worry.
-But l am worried, dimples.</i>

1039
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,978
<i>Some night,
you'll have a skinful and inadvertently--</i>

1040
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:43,671
<i>But l've got a skinful now...</i>

1041
01:09:43,781 --> 01:09:46,945
<i>...and l didn't tell you anything
you didn't know already, did l?</i>

1042
01:09:47,185 --> 01:09:50,154
Like about Sammy Burke for instance.
Now, he took this girl....

1043
01:09:55,493 --> 01:09:57,017
<i>You're telling me now.</i>

1044
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:00,226
<i>That's because you asked me.</i>

1045
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:03,668
<i>No. l didn't ask you.</i>

1046
01:10:05,504 --> 01:10:09,941
<i>l'm only giving you an example.
Charlie, dear, l know where to stop.</i>

1047
01:10:11,244 --> 01:10:13,940
<i>But l don't see any reason
to make it easy on them.</i>

1048
01:10:15,816 --> 01:10:16,942
l hate them.

1049
01:10:17,617 --> 01:10:21,951
<i>You know it says ''actress'' on my contract,
but they hired me for my figure, not to act.</i>

1050
01:10:22,089 --> 01:10:23,522
<i>But you've been acting.</i>

1051
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:24,883
Those bits?

1052
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:29,557
Three cigarette girls in two whole years.
You call that acting?

1053
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:33,160
<i>''Big part coming up. Testing you next week.</i>

1054
01:10:33,668 --> 01:10:35,465
<i>''Won't you come out to dinner?''</i>

1055
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:38,069
And next week never comes.

1056
01:10:39,274 --> 01:10:43,210
Charlie, they hire girls like me
to entertain the visiting exhibitors.

1057
01:10:44,113 --> 01:10:46,479
We know how to stand, to dress.

1058
01:10:46,849 --> 01:10:48,817
The clothes come out of wardrobe.

1059
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:50,879
<i>lt's cheaper than if they....</i>

1060
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:55,013
<i>l'm a deductible item.</i>

1061
01:10:56,392 --> 01:10:57,859
They write me off the books.

1062
01:10:57,961 --> 01:11:00,395
<i>Listen to uncle, collie dog.
Why don't you go back--</i>

1063
01:11:00,497 --> 01:11:02,397
That lousy studio!

1064
01:11:02,832 --> 01:11:05,563
They louse you up,
and then they call you a louse!

1065
01:11:12,276 --> 01:11:15,040
Honest, Charlie...

1066
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:18,515
<i>...wouldn't you be mad?</i>

1067
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:21,348
Sure l would.

1068
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,747
Well, there. See?

1069
01:11:33,232 --> 01:11:35,132
Look at this bit.

1070
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,562
<i>lt's what l learned.</i>

1071
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:39,799
Dearie...

1072
01:11:40,406 --> 01:11:43,466
...where is the swimming pool
you promised me?

1073
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:46,679
Here. Coming right up.

1074
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:48,446
Filled with brandy.

1075
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:53,380
Because the baby,
she cannot be kept waiting.

1076
01:11:58,926 --> 01:12:00,485
ls there somebody standing there?

1077
01:12:14,076 --> 01:12:15,373
This is my wife.

1078
01:12:17,746 --> 01:12:18,838
Miss Evans.

1079
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:22,017
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Castle.

1080
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:27,319
We were having a conversation.

1081
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:31,650
<i>Well, l've got to get back
to Monty's party now, Charlie.</i>

1082
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:35,953
Thanks for the drink
and the advice about my career.

1083
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:37,123
Sure, Dixie.

1084
01:12:37,434 --> 01:12:38,867
Thanks for coming over.

1085
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:45,198
<i>lt's been very pleasant.</i>

1086
01:12:47,345 --> 01:12:50,143
l meant everything l said about the studio.

1087
01:12:51,883 --> 01:12:53,442
Good night, Mrs. Castle.

1088
01:12:56,555 --> 01:12:59,319
<i>Lucky l didn't find Adam and Eve
in the swimming pool.</i>

1089
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:02,726
<i>-You're wrong, she's a little--
-l don't care what she is.</i>

1090
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:07,860
<i>l'm sorry, dear, but you're very wrong,
and l'll bet you $60 you're wrong.</i>

1091
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,025
Look.

1092
01:13:09,502 --> 01:13:12,994
l was getting ready to go to bed,
and a certain matter came up--

1093
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:15,973
<i>Why my heart should be going
a mile a minute, l don't know.</i>

1094
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:18,943
Call a cab, will you?

1095
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:22,913
<i>All right, l'll call it myself.</i>

1096
01:13:28,589 --> 01:13:30,955
<i>Can't you look at me and see the truth?</i>

1097
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,458
<i>l arrived a little too soon. That's the truth.</i>

1098
01:13:33,762 --> 01:13:38,096
l had Hank drive me back from Brentwood
because l really thought you needed me.

1099
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:41,259
<i>l'm all kinds of a fool
to give you a second thought, aren't l?</i>

1100
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:42,495
Yeah, yeah.

1101
01:13:43,638 --> 01:13:46,232
So what do you want from me? Bright dialogue?

1102
01:13:46,508 --> 01:13:48,204
Something brilliant, witty?

1103
01:13:51,981 --> 01:13:53,881
<i>What's your hurry?</i>

1104
01:13:54,884 --> 01:13:58,081
<i>You can call a cab anytime.
You've got all night to call a cab!</i>

1105
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:01,424
<i>You're a great little one for dramatic exits.</i>

1106
01:14:01,825 --> 01:14:05,625
<i>But l think this is the end of the line.
We've got to get it out on the table!</i>

1107
01:14:05,796 --> 01:14:07,423
-Sit down.
-No, thank you.

1108
01:14:08,799 --> 01:14:12,633
<i>lf you think l'm going to stay here
and listen to you, you're mistaken.</i>

1109
01:14:16,774 --> 01:14:18,036
Let me talk.

1110
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:24,112
<i>Don't push me back into my usual position
of self-justification.</i>

1111
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:30,213
<i>For the time being,
we'll throw away a bunch of rotten grapes...</i>

1112
01:14:30,322 --> 01:14:32,688
<i>...that's me, that you seem to feel is me...</i>

1113
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,624
...though l must say,
l think your judgment is lousy.

1114
01:14:35,728 --> 01:14:38,219
You swat the fly on my nose with a hammer!

1115
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:39,995
We throw it away.

1116
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:43,797
<i>Yet every time we talk, it's about Charlie Castle!</i>

1117
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,062
Never once...

1118
01:14:45,171 --> 01:14:49,938
...about his long-suffering, sickly wife, Marion.

1119
01:14:52,245 --> 01:14:54,737
Do you know where your fatal error lies?

1120
01:14:54,849 --> 01:14:57,249
<i>You ought to know, so l'm going to tell you.</i>

1121
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:01,744
<i>You're afflicted with a fine, fat case
of merchant psychology.</i>

1122
01:15:01,856 --> 01:15:03,983
You bargain and trifle with your own nature.

1123
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:05,388
<i>That's your error.</i>

1124
01:15:05,493 --> 01:15:09,225
<i>Tonight, you're about to possibly
destroy your life and certainly mine.</i>

1125
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:12,894
<i>Didn't we pick each other out of millions?</i>

1126
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:15,765
Can this be bargained away by saying,
like a merchant:

1127
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:19,832
<i>''Marion will be herself and love Charlie only if...</i>

1128
01:15:19,941 --> 01:15:23,241
<i>''...he meets a certain price and conditions''?</i>

1129
01:15:26,482 --> 01:15:30,680
<i>Where's the rich, full-hearted woman
l know you to be?</i>

1130
01:15:33,589 --> 01:15:36,855
l say no more bargains, no more conditions...

1131
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,693
...no more of this either-or,
neither-nor whim that strangles us both.

1132
01:15:41,799 --> 01:15:45,792
l say no, and l say
down with not being what we are.

1133
01:15:47,204 --> 01:15:48,637
You can talk.

1134
01:15:51,076 --> 01:15:54,341
<i>How you can talk when you're Charlie Castle.</i>

1135
01:15:55,113 --> 01:15:57,104
<i>l'd like to beat you, beat you...</i>

1136
01:15:57,215 --> 01:15:59,376
-Marion, l need you.
-...beat you!

1137
01:16:02,922 --> 01:16:04,014
l love you.

1138
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,761
l promise you understanding, devotion...

1139
01:16:10,262 --> 01:16:11,854
...anything l can give you.

1140
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:15,629
lf you leave me, cross your fingers as you go.

1141
01:16:15,769 --> 01:16:18,203
ln fact, pray for me.

1142
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:22,499
<i>But if you stay, it's got to be real.</i>

1143
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:25,100
<i>You've got to stop reaching for that doorknob.</i>

1144
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:28,577
<i>You've got to love me that much more
than you do yourself.</i>

1145
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,104
Thank you.

1146
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:07,289
Do me a favor, will you?

1147
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:09,688
<i>Grow up before it's too late.</i>

1148
01:17:23,742 --> 01:17:25,505
Just one more shot, Charlie.

1149
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,249
-Be with you in a minute, Hankus.
-All right.

1150
01:17:33,185 --> 01:17:35,619
-Thanks, Charlie.
-Thank you, honey.

1151
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:42,088
<i>So you're leaving us all.
Going back to write the great American novel?</i>

1152
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:44,322
<i>Hollywood's loss, New York's gain.</i>

1153
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,330
Lucky guy. l kind of envy you, Hank.

1154
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:49,162
<i>Well, there's still time. The Chief's a big train.</i>

1155
01:17:49,302 --> 01:17:51,828
Do you want me to make reservations for you?

1156
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:54,737
<i>-What's the book is going to be about?
-A man.</i>

1157
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:55,865
An average man.

1158
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:59,070
<i>-A man very much like you.
-Yes, that's very average.</i>

1159
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:01,981
Now, how could a man become
a popular movie star...

1160
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:04,984
...without reflecting the average
in one way or another?

1161
01:18:06,287 --> 01:18:08,118
ls it really about a guy like me?

1162
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:13,256
<i>lt's a fable, about moral values.</i>

1163
01:18:13,661 --> 01:18:15,891
Success, happiness.

1164
01:18:17,165 --> 01:18:20,135
<i>You don't think Marion
is going to be happy here, do you?</i>

1165
01:18:20,869 --> 01:18:24,032
<i>-No, l don't think she's going to be happy.
-Why not?</i>

1166
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,768
Because you were an idealist, Charlie,
and you sold out.

1167
01:18:27,876 --> 01:18:32,109
You joined Hoff, Coy, and Company,
and that left you half an idealist.

1168
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,943
<i>There's nothing more tortured
on the face of this earth, neither fish nor fowl.</i>

1169
01:18:37,387 --> 01:18:40,220
<i>A man who's sold out his dreams,
but he can't forget.</i>

1170
01:18:40,991 --> 01:18:44,928
<i>Yes, but there are reasons, pal.
You don't have all the facts.</i>

1171
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:49,460
<i>An lrishman wrote, l think l sent it to you once,
The Quintessence of Ibsenism.</i>

1172
01:18:49,567 --> 01:18:51,558
He said that there are three kinds of men.

1173
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:52,829
First, the realist.

1174
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:55,497
<i>Now, that's Coy.
He's made his deal with the devil.</i>

1175
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,403
<i>He wouldn't be any different.</i>

1176
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:02,237
<i>Then there's the philistine, like Hoff,
who couldn't be any different.</i>

1177
01:19:02,547 --> 01:19:03,809
But they are what they are.

1178
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:06,679
<i>They have their own integrity.
They're incorruptible.</i>

1179
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:09,747
<i>Then there's the third kind, the idealist.</i>

1180
01:19:10,155 --> 01:19:11,817
That was you.

1181
01:19:12,525 --> 01:19:15,653
Half-idealism, Charlie,
is the peritonitis of the soul.

1182
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,168
Go write your book, Hank. Make it scandalous.

1183
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:26,129
Wire me for money anytime you need it.

1184
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,500
Somebody has to complete
the work he was born to do.

1185
01:19:32,212 --> 01:19:36,205
<i>-Naive, ain't l?
-Yes, but it's one of your best qualities.</i>

1186
01:19:37,217 --> 01:19:40,585
<i>''Peritonitis of the soul.''
Those are the words you use above ground.</i>

1187
01:19:44,059 --> 01:19:45,458
Goodbye, Hank.

1188
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,392
Goodbye, Charlie.

1189
01:19:48,596 --> 01:19:51,292
Struggle, you may still win a blessing.

1190
01:20:00,076 --> 01:20:02,510
<i>Mr. Coy, he's been waiting for you.</i>

1191
01:20:08,085 --> 01:20:09,518
<i>Hey, kitty, what's up?</i>

1192
01:20:09,619 --> 01:20:12,144
<i>Where you been?
l've been looking everywhere for you.</i>

1193
01:20:12,456 --> 01:20:14,390
<i>Oddly enough, l've been at the studio.</i>

1194
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:17,756
Some stills,
and l wanted to say goodbye to a writer friend.

1195
01:20:17,861 --> 01:20:19,727
-Teagle?
-Yeah.

1196
01:20:19,964 --> 01:20:23,627
<i>l thought he went back to New York.
l'm trying to remember his first name.</i>

1197
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:25,093
Horatio.

1198
01:20:25,536 --> 01:20:28,903
-What did he ever write for us?
-Nothing that got on the screen.

1199
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:32,340
Stanley could never understand
what his scripts were about.

1200
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:38,475
<i>Charlie, something's come up, something hot.</i>

1201
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:42,281
<i>-l told Nat l wouldn't do that musical!
-lt's nothing to do with the musical.</i>

1202
01:20:42,388 --> 01:20:44,549
Stanley blew his top with Dixie Evans.

1203
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:47,754
He asked her to come in this afternoon
and have a talk.

1204
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:51,627
She showed up one hour late, drunk,
lugging a dog on a leash.

1205
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:53,589
A poodle?

1206
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:57,593
The situation being serious enough,
Stanley kept his temper.

1207
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:00,031
He talked to her like a father.

1208
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:02,336
-He said--
-Let me tell you what he said.

1209
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:04,536
He told her about his bootblack days
in Bayonne.

1210
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:07,409
<i>Then he chimed softly
the ''uneasy lies the head'' routine...</i>

1211
01:21:07,515 --> 01:21:11,383
...then, before you knew what was happening,
he was making with the tears.

1212
01:21:12,686 --> 01:21:15,155
-Then what happened?
-She laughed in his face.

1213
01:21:15,924 --> 01:21:18,085
Told him the whole town knew about his crying.

1214
01:21:18,193 --> 01:21:20,024
lt was time to change the act.

1215
01:21:21,663 --> 01:21:22,755
He hit her?

1216
01:21:23,165 --> 01:21:25,531
Knocked her down, kicked her black and blue.

1217
01:21:27,103 --> 01:21:29,003
May have broken one of her ribs.

1218
01:21:29,839 --> 01:21:31,830
They taped her up in the infirmary.

1219
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:37,107
Our story is that the dog,
one of those great big monsters...

1220
01:21:37,213 --> 01:21:40,047
...yanked on the leash and threw her to the floor.

1221
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:43,142
<i>She knows she can't make
an assault story stick, but...</i>

1222
01:21:43,887 --> 01:21:47,050
<i>...she says she's ready
to spill your story to the press.</i>

1223
01:21:47,191 --> 01:21:48,783
Particularly Patty Benedict.

1224
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:01,461
<i>-Where is she?
-That bar across from Schwab's.</i>

1225
01:22:02,207 --> 01:22:04,539
A woman with six martinis can ruin a city.

1226
01:22:07,246 --> 01:22:10,511
<i>-What are you smiling about?
-l'm not smiling.</i>

1227
01:22:15,988 --> 01:22:20,392
<i>-What next on our sordid agenda?
-Somebody's got to saddle the horse.</i>

1228
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:25,120
<i>You've got to go there and get her out of that bar.</i>

1229
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:26,859
-Get her to where?
-Her apartment.

1230
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:29,527
<i>-Why me?
-You're the only one she'll go with.</i>

1231
01:22:29,769 --> 01:22:31,361
<i>Now, don't worry about the telephone.</i>

1232
01:22:31,471 --> 01:22:33,803
<i>We've taken care of that. lt's been yanked.</i>

1233
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,066
<i>Feed her some martinis. That'll keep her quiet.</i>

1234
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,372
<i>-Suppose they don't.
-They will. The gin's doctored.</i>

1235
01:22:53,295 --> 01:22:56,264
<i>Okay, she's on the floor. Now what do l do?</i>

1236
01:22:56,899 --> 01:23:00,426
<i>Leave the minute she passes out.
From that moment on, you're in the clear.</i>

1237
01:23:00,536 --> 01:23:02,164
Report back to the studio.

1238
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,264
<i>You've been there all day long
making publicity stills.</i>

1239
01:23:10,246 --> 01:23:11,213
Here.

1240
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:24,350
Your words have hair on them.
Your brain is full of lice.

1241
01:23:24,528 --> 01:23:27,224
<i>Trust me, Charlie. There's no time to lose.</i>

1242
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:29,125
Just bear in mind one thing.

1243
01:23:29,234 --> 01:23:31,794
The day you first scheme,
you marry that scheme...

1244
01:23:31,903 --> 01:23:33,530
<i>...and the scheme's children.</i>

1245
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:39,234
<i>Everything you want this minute
depends on a few drinks in a trollop's guts.</i>

1246
01:23:40,178 --> 01:23:43,273
What do you think she is? A moth, a bug?

1247
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:47,443
Speak easy. Keep flexible, kitty.

1248
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:50,889
<i>She'll go unremembered by the end of the week.</i>

1249
01:23:55,028 --> 01:23:57,292
<i>-Where's Stanley?
-He doesn't know about this.</i>

1250
01:23:57,397 --> 01:24:01,128
<i>Then we'll have to tell him, won't we?
You find him, Smiley. l'll get Marion.</i>

1251
01:24:01,234 --> 01:24:03,202
<i>There's no reason for them to be involved.</i>

1252
01:24:03,303 --> 01:24:06,864
<i>But there's plenty of reason for me
to be involved even deeper than before?</i>

1253
01:24:06,974 --> 01:24:10,274
<i>l wouldn't do that, kitty.
And don't raise your voice again.</i>

1254
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,239
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

1255
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,475
<i>l'm the ''warrior minstrel with the forlorn hope.''</i>

1256
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,120
<i>-Sorry, l didn't mean to interrupt.
-lt's all right.</i>

1257
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,987
-Hello, Marion.
-Hello, Smiley.

1258
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,624
<i>l'll get my coat from the kitchen.</i>

1259
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,795
<i>-What's she doing here?
-Cheap serf labor. l pay her by the lifetime.</i>

1260
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:34,425
You were separated the other night.

1261
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:37,563
<i>l'm waiting. Take that library phone
and get that weeper here.</i>

1262
01:24:37,707 --> 01:24:41,541
<i>Okay. lf l can't count on you,
l'll handle this myself.</i>

1263
01:24:41,745 --> 01:24:44,839
<i>Murder is indivisible.
l'm finding that out, like chastity.</i>

1264
01:24:44,948 --> 01:24:47,781
<i>There's no such thing as a small amount.
l'm finding that out.</i>

1265
01:24:47,884 --> 01:24:49,443
<i>Don't blow your wig, scholar.</i>

1266
01:24:49,553 --> 01:24:50,986
Get me Stanley Hoff!

1267
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:55,090
<i>-All right, l'll do it myself.
-Don't be boyish, Charlie.</i>

1268
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:57,783
You think you can involve Stanley
in a thing like this?

1269
01:24:57,895 --> 01:25:01,991
<i>-He's already involved up to his neck.
-Prove it. Try and prove it.</i>

1270
01:25:02,668 --> 01:25:06,365
<i>For your own sake, this is nobody else's
business, not even your wife's.</i>

1271
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:11,502
Smiley Coy wants to tell you something!

1272
01:25:12,077 --> 01:25:14,341
<i>Kitty, l think you've really flipped.</i>

1273
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:17,907
<i>Marion, Charlie's drunk.</i>

1274
01:25:18,017 --> 01:25:19,609
Go on, tell her, Smiley.

1275
01:25:20,186 --> 01:25:21,585
Go ahead and tell her!

1276
01:25:21,688 --> 01:25:24,452
<i>Now, don't be impetuous, kitty. Watch your step.</i>

1277
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:28,693
<i>Charlie's not sober enough
to discuss the script today.</i>

1278
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:30,763
l have certain facts in my hand.

1279
01:25:30,864 --> 01:25:33,890
<i>lf they blow up,
l've got bleeding stumps left for hands.</i>

1280
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,431
<i>But you'll go, too.</i>

1281
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,535
This is Charlie Castle for Stanley Hoff.

1282
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:39,833
Charlie, what is it?

1283
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,464
Are you going to tell her?

1284
01:25:41,642 --> 01:25:44,908
Marion, Charlie gets fanciful ideas
about his friend.

1285
01:25:45,613 --> 01:25:49,606
<i>He's actually accusing me of plotting
the murder of a little studio bit player...</i>

1286
01:25:50,552 --> 01:25:53,783
...who was with him in the car
the night of the accident.

1287
01:25:56,859 --> 01:25:58,554
<i>l'll explain later, Marion.</i>

1288
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:02,187
Please, take the library phone
and get Nat here right away.

1289
01:26:05,801 --> 01:26:07,769
<i>Maybe you know what you're doing.</i>

1290
01:26:08,504 --> 01:26:10,803
<i>-l think l'll wait.
-l know you'll wait.</i>

1291
01:26:11,808 --> 01:26:13,639
<i>You'll wait and wait and wait.</i>

1292
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:18,609
<i>-You mishandle your friends, kitty.
-You're not my friend.</i>

1293
01:26:19,249 --> 01:26:21,444
That pathetic little girl is my friend.

1294
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:25,850
Lily? Uncle Hoff, please.

1295
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:33,492
<i>l know l'm not only expressing my views,
but yours as well.</i>

1296
01:26:34,298 --> 01:26:37,860
As for your idea that Smiley Coy thought
in terms of violence and crime...

1297
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:41,701
<i>...with all due respect to what you thought,
l can't give it credence.</i>

1298
01:26:41,807 --> 01:26:45,004
<i>You're saying Smiley didn't tell me anything.
l just dreamed it up.</i>

1299
01:26:45,144 --> 01:26:49,046
<i>l wouldn't say you dream by day,
but after a few drinks, isn't it possible?</i>

1300
01:26:49,148 --> 01:26:51,413
What is possible is exactly what l said.

1301
01:26:52,552 --> 01:26:55,043
<i>-Let me round out my thoughts.
-Don't round them out.</i>

1302
01:26:55,155 --> 01:26:56,986
<i>-l may continue--
-l don't want you to.</i>

1303
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:59,354
<i>You're never told,
the embroidery of your speech...</i>

1304
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:02,895
...is completely out of proportion
to anything you have to say.

1305
01:27:03,563 --> 01:27:04,622
All right.

1306
01:27:08,602 --> 01:27:09,796
<i>l'm listening.</i>

1307
01:27:11,605 --> 01:27:13,197
What do you have to say?

1308
01:27:14,909 --> 01:27:17,936
He came here one hour ago.
He said there was trouble.

1309
01:27:18,046 --> 01:27:21,140
-He then proposed that l--
-He proposed nothing of the sort!

1310
01:27:21,716 --> 01:27:25,152
To say a man like Smiley Coy,
a former major in the US Army Air Force...

1311
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:27,517
<i>...a friend of many,
l don't know where to begin...</i>

1312
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:30,557
<i>...the late Al Jolson,
Jerome Kern, Bill O'Dwyer....</i>

1313
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:33,686
To say that this man plotted murder
is to stagger reason.

1314
01:27:34,597 --> 01:27:36,394
<i>You're wasting valuable time.</i>

1315
01:27:36,933 --> 01:27:39,060
<i>Stanley, you're 1,000 percent right.</i>

1316
01:27:39,168 --> 01:27:42,103
Pneumonia is at the door,
and we are talking about a headache.

1317
01:27:42,205 --> 01:27:43,934
What would you do in my place?

1318
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,373
We have to convince this girl not to talk.

1319
01:27:46,476 --> 01:27:50,105
<i>l agree with you, but you can't ask me
to go into battle with my hands tied.</i>

1320
01:27:50,214 --> 01:27:51,977
<i>l've always been a simple man.</i>

1321
01:27:52,082 --> 01:27:56,075
And l still make my breakfast on a roll,
butter and a cup of coffee.

1322
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,751
<i>Can't you stop talking about yourself?</i>

1323
01:28:03,761 --> 01:28:05,786
Why does the woman have to be here?

1324
01:28:07,098 --> 01:28:08,622
The lady stays.

1325
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:14,836
Stanley, l want to go to this girl myself
and talk to her like a father.

1326
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:17,534
<i>See if we can't work out
some feasible cash offer...</i>

1327
01:28:17,643 --> 01:28:19,076
...out of my own pocket.

1328
01:28:19,178 --> 01:28:21,373
<i>-We could split the difference.
-lt's too late.</i>

1329
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,881
This girl is without the fundamentals
of an education and understanding.

1330
01:28:24,984 --> 01:28:29,922
What is the percentage for a few dollars
to cut off our nose and bite our face?

1331
01:28:30,023 --> 01:28:32,218
When l say no, l mean no.

1332
01:28:32,325 --> 01:28:34,725
<i>There are a few people in town
who've found this out.</i>

1333
01:28:34,828 --> 01:28:37,228
-But the girl must--
-All right, thank you very much.

1334
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:38,524
Wait a minute.

1335
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:42,236
What did Smiley whisper
into that phony tin trumpet?

1336
01:28:44,205 --> 01:28:45,570
You tell them, Smiley.

1337
01:28:45,907 --> 01:28:49,206
<i>That she's still at the bar
being entertained by a friend of mine.</i>

1338
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:53,441
<i>-lf anything happens to her--
-You're selling fish four days old, kitty.</i>

1339
01:28:53,615 --> 01:28:56,812
<i>She's with Monty Ritz. ls he a conspirator, too?</i>

1340
01:28:56,919 --> 01:28:57,681
Why not?

1341
01:28:57,786 --> 01:29:00,778
For all l know,
you could have a blackmail on Monty, too.

1342
01:29:00,889 --> 01:29:02,584
<i>We're talking about murder.</i>

1343
01:29:05,595 --> 01:29:07,495
Your client has to learn how to talk.

1344
01:29:07,864 --> 01:29:10,526
We know who the expert is
when it comes to murder.

1345
01:29:10,633 --> 01:29:12,965
A boy like you? Who are you?

1346
01:29:13,703 --> 01:29:16,695
Who are you? Some kind of special aristocracy...

1347
01:29:16,806 --> 01:29:20,038
...because the female public
wants to make love with you?

1348
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:24,103
Who are you,
with your dirty, unmanicured fingernails...

1349
01:29:24,381 --> 01:29:28,442
...and what are you without
Hoff-Federated behind you?

1350
01:29:28,852 --> 01:29:33,552
l built the studio! l, with my brain and my hand!

1351
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:36,991
l ripped it out of the world
with my brains and my hands!

1352
01:29:37,095 --> 01:29:38,357
And who are you?

1353
01:29:38,463 --> 01:29:40,055
No, this must stop!

1354
01:29:40,231 --> 01:29:42,426
Why do l have to listen to this miserable boy?

1355
01:29:42,534 --> 01:29:45,662
<i>A man like myself, who's wined and dined
with presidents and kings?</i>

1356
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:49,366
-My aching back!
-Do l have to cater to this?

1357
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:52,842
<i>Well, l've had enough
of your phony senatorial eloquence.</i>

1358
01:29:53,112 --> 01:29:55,080
<i>l'll chop you down like firewood.</i>

1359
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:57,741
lt is a bit of miserable pity
that l have to talk to you.

1360
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,317
<i>That's it. That's the deal.</i>

1361
01:29:59,418 --> 01:30:00,852
Charlie, l beg of you, please!

1362
01:30:00,954 --> 01:30:03,081
We never have to talk to each other again.

1363
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,681
<i>Nat, you're my agent.
From now on, it's you and him.</i>

1364
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,184
l never have to talk to him again.

1365
01:30:08,762 --> 01:30:11,253
<i>-You'll drive me too far.
-Will l?</i>

1366
01:30:11,932 --> 01:30:13,867
<i>What's your boiling point, Uncle Hoff?</i>

1367
01:30:14,068 --> 01:30:17,560
<i>Well, don't sulk, don't act bored,
and please don't cry.</i>

1368
01:30:17,839 --> 01:30:19,466
Charlie, l beg of you, please.

1369
01:30:19,574 --> 01:30:23,066
<i>l'm deliberately tampering
with your modest ego, Stanley...</i>

1370
01:30:23,177 --> 01:30:25,975
...because today l see
what Stanley Shriner Hoff would do...

1371
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,140
...to protect an investment. Murder.

1372
01:30:28,817 --> 01:30:31,445
This man buries himself with his mouth.

1373
01:30:31,754 --> 01:30:33,551
Look at him. Get his act.

1374
01:30:34,189 --> 01:30:35,952
<i>He's trying to play the crocodile.</i>

1375
01:30:36,058 --> 01:30:39,118
And what is he? A little lizard under a rock.

1376
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:41,754
Get together with the legal department
in the morning...

1377
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:44,231
...check the Castle contract
and find me an opening.

1378
01:30:44,334 --> 01:30:46,029
You find me a pen.

1379
01:30:47,771 --> 01:30:49,762
<i>l think there's one other solution.</i>

1380
01:30:50,006 --> 01:30:53,305
Yes, here it comes, the gimmick,
the twist, the old switcheroo.

1381
01:30:53,443 --> 01:30:56,345
<i>There's always a twist, sweetie.
They always work in pairs.</i>

1382
01:30:56,447 --> 01:30:58,972
<i>There's an angle to this Dixie problem.</i>

1383
01:30:59,116 --> 01:31:00,879
Marion, it depends upon you.

1384
01:31:01,318 --> 01:31:02,285
What?

1385
01:31:02,586 --> 01:31:06,113
You and Charlie have been separated
three times in the last two years.

1386
01:31:07,024 --> 01:31:09,186
Do you love him enough to make a sacrifice?

1387
01:31:09,294 --> 01:31:11,319
-Do l love him?
-Let him finish, dear.

1388
01:31:11,797 --> 01:31:15,995
<i>Dixie would marry Charlie in a minute.
lt's the fulfillment of all her dreams.</i>

1389
01:31:16,768 --> 01:31:19,635
Community property laws
will automatically take care of you.

1390
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:21,969
Half of everything Charlie owns belongs to you.

1391
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:24,407
<i>Gentlemen, l can't believe my ears!</i>

1392
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:28,776
<i>Let him finish before you jump in
where it doesn't concern you, Nat.</i>

1393
01:31:30,216 --> 01:31:33,947
This woman has been having to do with a writer
we had on the lot recently.

1394
01:31:34,053 --> 01:31:35,248
<i>That isn't true.</i>

1395
01:31:35,355 --> 01:31:37,482
From time to time, they had relations.

1396
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,057
<i>That just isn't true!</i>

1397
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:40,751
Let me handle this.

1398
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,491
Of course, you have proof.

1399
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:45,854
Records.

1400
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:50,564
<i>You have records of conversations l've had
with Mr. Teagle in his office?</i>

1401
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,907
And tape recordings in his office
and on his couch.

1402
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:58,079
Who ordered such recordings to be made?

1403
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:01,215
<i>l couldn't say. That's out of my hands.</i>

1404
01:32:01,317 --> 01:32:03,547
-Where are they?
-ln my car.

1405
01:32:06,255 --> 01:32:07,222
Get them.

1406
01:32:07,957 --> 01:32:09,652
Get them, Smiley.

1407
01:32:13,229 --> 01:32:14,253
Get them.

1408
01:32:19,836 --> 01:32:23,863
<i>''Live and let live'' has always been
an important motto with me, Marion.</i>

1409
01:32:26,276 --> 01:32:29,110
l have nothing against you personally,
you understand.

1410
01:32:29,413 --> 01:32:33,144
<i>But sometimes, for the good of the company,
l'm forced to play a little rough.</i>

1411
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:35,048
Nat, a little sparkling water.

1412
01:32:42,828 --> 01:32:45,160
All right. All right.

1413
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:48,962
<i>My career is finished, and l'm willing...</i>

1414
01:32:49,368 --> 01:32:54,271
<i>...namely because you're the meanest,
dirtiest skunk God ever put breath into.</i>

1415
01:32:56,075 --> 01:33:00,136
This is Mr. Hoff,
a man that l fall down on my knees...

1416
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:03,773
<i>...and thank my maker that l don't
have to play ball with him anymore.</i>

1417
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:09,886
<i>Excuse me, Charlie, dear, that l'm crying.</i>

1418
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:15,894
<i>Don't worry, Marion.</i>

1419
01:33:16,764 --> 01:33:17,992
<i>Don't worry, Charlie.</i>

1420
01:33:18,098 --> 01:33:21,898
<i>Before l'll get you in trouble,
l'll put my own head on the railroad tracks.</i>

1421
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:35,884
<i>There's nothing to defend about those records.</i>

1422
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:59,005
<i>lt's late.</i>

1423
01:33:59,977 --> 01:34:02,537
<i>Don't you boys ever go home to dinner?</i>

1424
01:34:03,681 --> 01:34:04,841
Do that.

1425
01:34:05,149 --> 01:34:07,845
Do that for me, Smiley. Take Hoff home.

1426
01:34:08,286 --> 01:34:09,753
Get him out of here.

1427
01:34:21,967 --> 01:34:23,559
<i>You're so lucky.</i>

1428
01:34:24,303 --> 01:34:27,363
<i>lf this were a movie,
you'd have been on the floor 10 times.</i>

1429
01:34:34,281 --> 01:34:36,181
Just a small token.

1430
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:40,347
<i>l'll break you.</i>

1431
01:34:41,354 --> 01:34:43,255
<i>l'll break you like a--</i>

1432
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:49,730
No.

1433
01:34:51,832 --> 01:34:54,733
<i>No, no, l'll let the law do it for me.</i>

1434
01:34:55,303 --> 01:34:58,535
<i>l'll let the law do it for me this time,
and you lose everything.</i>

1435
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:03,734
You lose everything.
This is a scandal and a disaster and a ruin.

1436
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:06,645
<i>The dead child's family
and the insurance company...</i>

1437
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:09,842
...will take everything off your back
in any court in the land.

1438
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:13,183
The clothes off your back,
off your child, and off that woman.

1439
01:35:13,556 --> 01:35:14,989
Everything goes, Charlie.

1440
01:35:15,325 --> 01:35:20,388
Everything goes, the house goes,
the paintings go, and you!

1441
01:35:20,663 --> 01:35:22,221
You go!

1442
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:25,765
Oh, no, Charlie.

1443
01:35:29,206 --> 01:35:31,174
You threw away a kingdom today.

1444
01:35:38,883 --> 01:35:39,941
Well?

1445
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,244
Go on.

1446
01:35:43,355 --> 01:35:44,583
Goodbye, kitty.

1447
01:35:45,256 --> 01:35:47,451
<i>l'll leave you to the wolves and the knives.</i>

1448
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:50,823
You no longer have me and the studio
to handle the press for you.

1449
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:52,725
<i>You're through.</i>

1450
01:35:52,965 --> 01:35:55,263
What l said still goes.
lf anything happens to her--

1451
01:35:55,368 --> 01:35:57,836
The studio has no further interest in that girl.

1452
01:36:10,984 --> 01:36:12,508
All quiet.

1453
01:36:13,253 --> 01:36:14,481
l need a tonic.

1454
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:20,359
There are things beyond money to that man...

1455
01:36:21,062 --> 01:36:23,223
...but this much money....

1456
01:36:23,331 --> 01:36:24,889
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

1457
01:36:25,633 --> 01:36:28,830
<i>He talks with his mouth,
but he'll protect his investment.</i>

1458
01:36:30,004 --> 01:36:31,768
And in the meanwhile...

1459
01:36:31,874 --> 01:36:34,399
<i>...l'll tell you what Uncle Nat will do.</i>

1460
01:36:34,576 --> 01:36:37,101
<i>l'll take Miss Dixie Evans home with me...</i>

1461
01:36:37,212 --> 01:36:40,773
<i>...and out of my own pocket,
l'll offer her a $10,000 bill.</i>

1462
01:36:40,949 --> 01:36:43,975
<i>No, Nat. lt's too late.
lt's too late from my point of view.</i>

1463
01:36:45,755 --> 01:36:48,781
<i>l can't go on covering one crime with another.</i>

1464
01:36:51,261 --> 01:36:52,956
<i>That's Macbeth.</i>

1465
01:36:53,196 --> 01:36:56,461
Charlie, dear,
please, stop wringing your mental hands.

1466
01:36:56,566 --> 01:36:59,092
<i>Macbeth is an allegory, Nat.</i>

1467
01:36:59,737 --> 01:37:01,261
One by one, he...

1468
01:37:02,106 --> 01:37:04,802
...killed his better selves.

1469
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:08,168
My back is stiff.

1470
01:37:08,546 --> 01:37:10,013
Go home, Nat.

1471
01:37:10,214 --> 01:37:11,807
<i>l'll go over later and talk to Dixie.</i>

1472
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:14,750
The worst that happens,
she passes out, Monty puts her to bed.

1473
01:37:14,853 --> 01:37:16,377
<i>He's done it before.</i>

1474
01:37:16,621 --> 01:37:17,849
<i>l'll call you later.</i>

1475
01:37:17,956 --> 01:37:19,617
-You promise?
-Yes, around 8:00.

1476
01:37:19,724 --> 01:37:21,521
<i>Now, don't worry. l'll call you.</i>

1477
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:22,957
Goodbye, dear.

1478
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,123
Goodbye, darlings.

1479
01:37:28,234 --> 01:37:29,758
<i>-You'll call?
-Yes.</i>

1480
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,401
<i>-You're sure?
-Yes, l'm sure.</i>

1481
01:37:50,858 --> 01:37:53,384
Why did l add this burden to that...

1482
01:37:53,495 --> 01:37:56,362
...grotesque, devoted soul?

1483
01:37:59,334 --> 01:38:02,394
Did you ever notice
he moves his lips when he reads?

1484
01:38:04,105 --> 01:38:05,732
<i>Darling, here's Nicky.</i>

1485
01:38:06,075 --> 01:38:09,374
Well, what do you say?
Can l get you something?

1486
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:11,374
Marion? Charlie?

1487
01:38:14,049 --> 01:38:15,277
Yeah, Nicko.

1488
01:38:19,188 --> 01:38:20,554
Go run a bath for me.

1489
01:38:21,224 --> 01:38:23,715
Good and hot. My back is stiff.

1490
01:38:23,894 --> 01:38:25,953
<i>Don't worry, l'll take care of that.</i>

1491
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:33,535
<i>-That thing between you and Hank....
-No, darling, l didn't.</i>

1492
01:38:33,638 --> 01:38:36,004
<i>Now, don't explain. l believe you.</i>

1493
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:40,637
Look how sweaty....

1494
01:38:43,147 --> 01:38:44,478
My hands....

1495
01:38:47,519 --> 01:38:48,816
Come here, angel.

1496
01:38:48,921 --> 01:38:49,945
Sit here.

1497
01:38:58,063 --> 01:38:59,121
Well?

1498
01:39:01,401 --> 01:39:03,369
What do you think of today?

1499
01:39:04,003 --> 01:39:06,198
Think l can list all the possible roads ahead?

1500
01:39:06,306 --> 01:39:10,299
<i>Don't bother. We won't silence that girl.
lt's become the cause of her life.</i>

1501
01:39:11,511 --> 01:39:15,949
You see, everyone needs a cause
to touch greatness.

1502
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:20,176
<i>Hank doesn't leave until tomorrow.</i>

1503
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:24,648
-Did you ever tell him about all this?
-No.

1504
01:39:27,195 --> 01:39:30,790
<i>Why don't we call him over?
Hank knows how to fix.</i>

1505
01:39:33,735 --> 01:39:34,793
All right.

1506
01:39:52,788 --> 01:39:53,915
Hello, Hank?

1507
01:39:54,858 --> 01:39:57,418
Look, dear,
would you come over here right away?

1508
01:39:57,728 --> 01:40:00,026
Yes, we need your advice about something.

1509
01:40:00,464 --> 01:40:02,091
<i>Yes, it's very important.</i>

1510
01:40:03,133 --> 01:40:06,227
<i>''The times beyond are cold and lonely.</i>

1511
01:40:08,139 --> 01:40:09,970
<i>''Far away as the stars.''</i>

1512
01:40:13,211 --> 01:40:15,202
Once, there were two of us.

1513
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:22,315
<i>Billy mustn't grow up to be a rich man's son.</i>

1514
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,181
<i>-He won't.
-They're usually made of sponge cake.</i>

1515
01:40:27,493 --> 01:40:28,790
<i>But he won't be.</i>

1516
01:40:33,732 --> 01:40:38,227
<i>You've taught me so many things, darling,
even how to listen to music.</i>

1517
01:40:40,707 --> 01:40:43,699
-Play some music.
-All right.

1518
01:40:45,078 --> 01:40:48,708
-What would you like to hear?
-Something immortal.

1519
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:52,310
<i>l don't know, anything that's on the machine.</i>

1520
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,855
<i>I can never leave him, Hank.</i>

1521
01:41:01,963 --> 01:41:05,091
<i>It's not just that I'm a wife
of the old-fashioned school.</i>

1522
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:07,528
<i>I'm so deeply a part of his existence.</i>

1523
01:41:08,603 --> 01:41:11,538
<i>No matter how many times I leave,
I always go back.</i>

1524
01:41:12,474 --> 01:41:13,998
<i>He's part of me.</i>

1525
01:41:14,876 --> 01:41:18,506
<i>The most terrible things he can do to me
are better than not having him.</i>

1526
01:41:39,803 --> 01:41:41,794
<i>lt wasn't what l expected to hear.</i>

1527
01:41:56,155 --> 01:42:00,251
-ls it getting dark in here?
-Yes, darling, it is.

1528
01:42:00,993 --> 01:42:02,585
<i>l'll turn on the lights.</i>

1529
01:42:08,667 --> 01:42:10,158
Hello, Buddy.

1530
01:42:12,572 --> 01:42:14,301
Hiya, Buddy.

1531
01:42:18,512 --> 01:42:20,104
<i>What's the matter, kid?</i>

1532
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,275
You were my friend.

1533
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,553
l knew what she was.

1534
01:42:27,822 --> 01:42:30,154
Tore the heart out of me every time it happened.

1535
01:42:30,258 --> 01:42:31,691
You were my friend.

1536
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,585
How could you do it?

1537
01:42:38,367 --> 01:42:40,392
You want to hit me?

1538
01:42:42,571 --> 01:42:44,436
Please, hit me.

1539
01:42:46,475 --> 01:42:48,943
<i>l know you're a better man than l am.</i>

1540
01:42:49,044 --> 01:42:52,412
l mean, such a swell guy you were, Charles.

1541
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:55,077
l always looked up to you.

1542
01:42:56,953 --> 01:43:00,480
But when she told me, she laughed in my face.

1543
01:43:05,229 --> 01:43:06,662
<i>That's how l resign.</i>

1544
01:43:33,492 --> 01:43:35,960
C.U.F. Castle.

1545
01:43:37,263 --> 01:43:39,697
He murdered Cass. l was there.

1546
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:41,059
l saw him do it.

1547
01:43:42,902 --> 01:43:44,768
<i>Charlie, the bathtub's almost full.</i>

1548
01:43:44,872 --> 01:43:48,364
<i>l run out of big towels upstairs,
so l'll get some from the cabana.</i>

1549
01:43:56,183 --> 01:43:59,642
Did you ever know that all my life...

1550
01:43:59,754 --> 01:44:02,882
<i>...l've yearned for people
to bring out the best in me.</i>

1551
01:44:05,126 --> 01:44:06,093
Marion.

1552
01:44:14,803 --> 01:44:16,668
All that embittered you....

1553
01:44:19,008 --> 01:44:21,101
l pledge you a better future.

1554
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,039
Have l told you today how much l love you?

1555
01:44:53,278 --> 01:44:54,370
l love you.

1556
01:44:55,547 --> 01:44:57,481
<i>And l'm committed to you.</i>

1557
01:44:57,783 --> 01:44:59,580
<i>We won't talk about the past.</i>

1558
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:19,265
Telephone for you, Mrs. Castle.

1559
01:45:19,373 --> 01:45:22,240
<i>-lt's Billy, he's calling from the Stevens'.
-Thank you.</i>

1560
01:45:22,343 --> 01:45:24,538
<i>There'll be four of us. Make a light supper.</i>

1561
01:45:24,645 --> 01:45:26,203
Light supper for four, right.

1562
01:45:26,347 --> 01:45:29,407
<i>And no parsley on anything.
Mr. Castle doesn't like it.</i>

1563
01:45:29,516 --> 01:45:30,483
Right.

1564
01:45:34,789 --> 01:45:36,017
Hello, darling.

1565
01:45:36,358 --> 01:45:37,484
How are you?

1566
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:42,356
Poor cowboys, what a shame.

1567
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,901
<i>Why don't you hit him back?</i>

1568
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:50,498
No, wait a minute, Billy, l was wrong.

1569
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,439
<i>Don't hit him back.</i>

1570
01:45:53,476 --> 01:45:57,537
<i>Explain to him that,
since he's bigger than you, it isn't fair.</i>

1571
01:45:59,549 --> 01:46:04,009
<i>Sure, l'll pick you up after lunch tomorrow.
Now, don't forget to brush your teeth.</i>

1572
01:46:05,455 --> 01:46:06,945
Good night, darling.

1573
01:46:07,357 --> 01:46:08,915
l just let myself in.

1574
01:46:09,092 --> 01:46:12,392
<i>l'm sorry about what happened here
this afternoon. Deeply sorry.</i>

1575
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,690
May l use your phone?

1576
01:46:13,798 --> 01:46:16,665
<i>Don't go,
you'll be interested in what l've got to say.</i>

1577
01:46:17,402 --> 01:46:21,395
Mr. Hoff is a very vain man.
We have to cater to that sometimes.

1578
01:46:22,173 --> 01:46:25,006
<i>Lily, put me through to the old man.
lt's important.</i>

1579
01:46:25,243 --> 01:46:26,336
<i>Where's Charlie?</i>

1580
01:46:26,445 --> 01:46:28,436
Taking a bath. What do you want?

1581
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,204
You misunderstand, Marion.

1582
01:46:30,315 --> 01:46:33,478
<i>l'm nothing more
than a sort of memo pad for Mr. Hoff.</i>

1583
01:46:33,752 --> 01:46:34,741
Stanley.

1584
01:46:35,087 --> 01:46:37,146
The girl left the bar 10 minutes ago.

1585
01:46:37,322 --> 01:46:39,655
Tried to navigate across Sunset Boulevard.

1586
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:43,093
Yeah, in all that heavy, home-going traffic.

1587
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:46,697
<i>That's the picture.</i>

1588
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:48,793
Killed instantly.

1589
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:52,903
How do you like that for the luck of the lrish?

1590
01:46:53,007 --> 01:46:55,032
<i>l'm here using Charlie's phone now.</i>

1591
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:58,310
<i>Okay, l'll be right back in. Bye.</i>

1592
01:46:59,013 --> 01:47:01,914
-Marion, before you say anything--
-What a happy coincidence.

1593
01:47:02,116 --> 01:47:03,981
lt was a city bus that hit her.

1594
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:07,818
<i>-Changes everything, doesn't it?
-Does it?</i>

1595
01:47:07,923 --> 01:47:11,086
<i>Not that Stanley's forgotten
what happened here this afternoon.</i>

1596
01:47:11,193 --> 01:47:14,287
Some sort of an apology
should be arranged, carefully, of course.

1597
01:47:14,496 --> 01:47:16,259
Yours is just the level head to do it.

1598
01:47:16,364 --> 01:47:18,559
<i>Don't you have a memory
from one hour to the next?</i>

1599
01:47:18,667 --> 01:47:20,135
<i>Don't go dramatic on me.</i>

1600
01:47:20,236 --> 01:47:23,865
<i>Seven years is a long time.
We've got a long row to hoe.</i>

1601
01:47:23,973 --> 01:47:25,634
How does someone like you live?

1602
01:47:25,875 --> 01:47:29,038
<i>This afternoon, you try to ruin a man
who's 10 times your better...</i>

1603
01:47:29,145 --> 01:47:30,806
...and when you were finished...

1604
01:47:30,913 --> 01:47:34,748
...you toted out of here in the footsteps
of a thing not even fit to breath.

1605
01:47:34,852 --> 01:47:37,218
Charlie, something must be wrong
with that valve.

1606
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:39,983
<i>What's going on?
Water's leaking down to the kitchen.</i>

1607
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:42,251
Charlie, l think you let the tub run over.

1608
01:47:47,165 --> 01:47:48,826
<i>There's water all over the hall!</i>

1609
01:47:48,933 --> 01:47:51,458
Tell him to try to break the bathroom door down!

1610
01:47:51,769 --> 01:47:53,327
Charlie, open the door!

1611
01:48:11,123 --> 01:48:12,249
Get the water off!

1612
01:48:18,465 --> 01:48:20,126
<i>What's happened?</i>

1613
01:48:23,003 --> 01:48:24,800
l never in my life saw anything so wrong.

1614
01:48:24,905 --> 01:48:27,898
<i>-What happened with Charlie?
-l can't tell you what happened.</i>

1615
01:48:28,442 --> 01:48:31,570
<i>-Please, Mrs. Castle. Please!
-Don't hold me, Russell. Let me go!</i>

1616
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:33,374
<i>l'm sorry, but you can't come in.</i>

1617
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,278
Put me through to Eddie Fry.

1618
01:48:35,449 --> 01:48:37,508
Break through. This is Smiley Coy.

1619
01:48:37,718 --> 01:48:39,151
Pull the plug, stupid!

1620
01:48:42,357 --> 01:48:44,882
<i>Now, listen carefully,
l don't want to repeat a word.</i>

1621
01:48:44,993 --> 01:48:45,960
Listen!

1622
01:48:46,428 --> 01:48:48,828
Get Dr. Curley, get Stanley...

1623
01:48:48,931 --> 01:48:51,491
<i>...send them here
to Charlie Castle's house right away.</i>

1624
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,331
<i>You get here, and do your work for me.
Here's your work.</i>

1625
01:48:54,437 --> 01:48:56,302
Take this down word for word.

1626
01:48:56,973 --> 01:49:01,467
<i>''Charlie Castle, renowned star
of 30 Hoff-Federated Pictures...</i>

Stanley Shriner Hoff.''</i>

1633

and the rest of the wire services.

<i>Don't ask questions!</i>

1635

Bring 12 studio cops when you come.
This place will be a madhouse in a minute.

1636
01:49:38,751 --> 01:49:39,718
What?

1637
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:43,914
Tell Stanley he slashed himself in three places.

1638
01:50:01,108 --> 01:50:03,634
Hey, Nick, snap out of it.

1639
01:50:04,579 --> 01:50:08,037
<i>Go on, clean up. Change your clothes.
There'll be a nice piece of change.</i>

<i>Punchy, l'm talking to you.</i>

1641

Come on, snap out of it.

1642
01:50:18,994 --> 01:50:21,224
You killed him...

1643
01:50:23,132 --> 01:50:25,362
...the whole bunch of you.

1644
01:50:26,568 --> 01:50:28,536
You found him.

1645
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,837
Killed him.

1646
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:35,437
Go away.

-That's why it's necessary.</i>

1652
01:51:33,006 --> 01:51:35,941
This is no time to get contentious, kitty.

1653

Your work is finished here.

1654

<i>l'll tell the story.</i>

1656
01:51:46,454 --> 01:51:47,819
He killed himself...

1657
01:51:49,825 --> 01:51:53,989
...out of the pain and anguished love
he had for others, he gave up his salvation.

1658
01:51:56,165 --> 01:52:00,602
But no man had a greater reverence for life,
a greater zest for living.

1659
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:03,863
Yes, he was wrong.

1660
01:52:05,675 --> 01:52:08,269
<i>But he just couldn't go on
hurting those he loved.</i>

1661
01:53:05,005 --> 01:53:06,199
Charlie.

1662
01:53:14,749 --> 01:53:15,841
Help.

1663
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,937
Help! Help! Help!
