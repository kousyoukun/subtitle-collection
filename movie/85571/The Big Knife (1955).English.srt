1
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,044
<i>This is Bel Air...</i>

2
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,742
<i>...the lush, luxurious retreat
of the wealthy and powerful.</i>

3
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,911
<i>If you work in the motion picture industry
and are successful...</i>

4
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,855
<i>...this well-tended suburb of Hollywood is
where you will probably make your home.</i>

5
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,154
<i>Failure is not permitted here.</i>

6
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,826
<i>Our story has to do
with a 20th-century phenomenon.</i>

7
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,029
<i>Name: Charlie Castle.</i>

8
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,765
<i>Profession: movie star.</i>

9
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,672
<i>Problem: survival.</i>

10
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,675
<i>Charlie Castle is a man
who sold out his dreams...</i>

11
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,869
<i>...but he can't forget them.</i>

12
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,450
<i>Great, isn't he?</i>

13
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,790
What a guy.

14
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,023
<i>Tell him l'm here.</i>

15
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,100
<i>Sure, Patty, right away.
l know he'll be glad to see you.</i>

16
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,544
Hold it.

17
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,908
<i>-What's up, Buddy?
-Patty Benedict's here.</i>

18
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,244
What, did she just walk in?

19
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,289
l was told she was going to drop by here,
l raced right over.

20
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,018
Patty Benedict.

21
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,323
<i>You had me tied up in there, didn't you?</i>

22
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,953
l faked you in. You came in too fast, sweetheart.

23
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,759
<i>What's Patty want, Charlie?</i>

24
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,464
Marion, separation....

25
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,968
How does it get around? What did you tell her?

26
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,232
<i>Nothing. lf l had, she wouldn't be here now.</i>

27
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,137
l work for the studio.
l have to keep you out of trouble.

28
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,211
Good.

29
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,170
So get me out of this.

30
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,406
-Play ball with her, huh?
-Play ball?

31
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,077
<i>l'd like to play ball with her head.</i>

32
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,585
Take it easy, will you?

33
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,246
<i>Schmooze her a little.
She's got 18 million readers.</i>

34
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,117
<i>l'll have her out of here in five minutes flat.</i>

35
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,886
Relax, Buddy. Stop worrying.

36
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,660
<i>l've handled this a hundred times.</i>

37
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,964
What a guy.

38
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,561
You had me scared there for a minute.

39
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,101
Patty, darling.

40
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,743
How are you, sweetie?

41
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,469
-Light my cigarette, Chuck.
-Sure.

42
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,708
<i>What happened to you last night?
l looked around and you'd gone.</i>

43
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,784
l asked Mike, but--

44
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,045
Smiley Coy had somebody
he wanted me to meet...

45
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,951
...some of those strip shirts from out of town.

46
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,751
Who wants what from the lemonade stand?

47
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,254
-Buddy?
-No, no, thanks.

48
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,159
l like the airiness of this room.

49
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,526
-French paintings, dear one?
-Yeah.

50
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,731
<i>Don't you buy American anymore?</i>

51
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,806
<i>Let nothing you dismay,
l don't know one painter from another.</i>

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,771
<i>He doesn't know one painter from another.</i>

53
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,173
<i>l wouldn't want my fans to think l'd gone arty.</i>

54
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,645
<i>-They're Marion's hobby.
-Yeah, they're his wife's hobby.</i>

55
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,744
How long do l know you, Chuck?

56
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,477
Nine, ten years.

57
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,886
When we first met,
all you could talk about was the New Deal...

58
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,388
...or the fair deal or some deal.

59
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,188
l believed in it.

60
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,921
What do you believe in now?

61
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,759
Health, hard work, rare roast beef...

62
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,023
...and good scripts.

63
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,569
<i>You're a lot smarter child than you used to be.</i>

64
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,070
l had to learn, Patricia.

65
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,139
<i>Charlie's slogan:</i>

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,969
<i>''Got a message, send for Western Union.''</i>

67
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,702
<i>l hear your new picture's good.</i>

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,575
<i>lt'll pay a dividend.</i>

69
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,079
-What about your new contract?
-What about it, Buddy?

70
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,648
The studio got the contracts all--

71
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,513
Stanley Hoff told me last week,
you were about to re-sign.

72
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,747
<i>He's the head of the studio.
lt doesn't cost him a thing to dream.</i>

73
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,952
Are you and Stanley having a feud?

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,353
How could l feud with Uncle Hoff?

75
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,395
<i>-Mr. Hoff's been like a father to Charlie.
-Why, sure.</i>

76
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,288
<i>Chuck, l'm off to Metro.</i>

77
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,095
But before l go, l want the truth
about the separation rumors.

78
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,330
<i>She's always trying to tag me.
The rumors are just that, rumors.</i>

79
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,669
But why in the world--

80
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,302
<i>Marion took Billy to the beach
because he's got a cold.</i>

81
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,176
<i>l don't think l'd ever forgive you...</i>

82
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,080
...lf someone else printed
your divorce story before l did.

83
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,417
l hope you understand that.

84
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,318
He understands that.

85
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,093
Do l?

86
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,355
-What Charlie means by that is--
-Shut up for five minutes.

87
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,298
<i>l want my gossip from the horse's mouth,
not his tail.</i>

88
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,958
<i>Patty, it's his living.</i>

89
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,130
ls it impossible for you to be democratic?

90
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,974
Fix yourself a drink, Buddy.

91
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,645
<i>Look, l don't want you to get stiff, take a chill.</i>

92
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,319
-How are you, Miss Benedict?
-Fine, thank you, Nick.

93
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,817
<i>Well, that's nice.
l've got everything ready for your rub.</i>

94
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,491
Thanks, character.

95
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,562
<i>One thing l've never understood.</i>

96
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,193
Why did the studio give Bliss back his job
after that scandalous mess?

97
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,507
<i>Buddy Bliss is a first-rate publicity man.
He's also a close personal friend.</i>

98
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,338
l know.

99
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,675
You were a character witness for him
and you paid all his legal fees.

100
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,182
<i>l don't get your point, sweetie.
Buddy went to jail for 10 months.</i>

101
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,485
<i>Besides, it's all past and forgotten.</i>

102
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,186
<i>lt's not forgotten if l choose to revive it.</i>

103
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,916
Now, why would you want to do that?

104
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,255
Some of you forget that
this town has got to keep its skirts clean.

105
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,159
At the studio Christmas party,
this idiot steals your car--

106
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,858
-He borrowed my car.
-He drives along half-drunk--

107
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,332
<i>He wasn't drunk. That was cleared in court.</i>

108
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,367
The fact remains, he hit and ran.

109
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,938
How friendly did you feel when Big Brains here...

110
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,441
...ditched the car on your lawn
and the police walked in Christmas Eve?

111
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,102
-All he did--
-Now, Patty.

112
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,146
All he did, your dear friend...

113
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,977
...was to almost ruin a career
right out of the storybooks.

114
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,517
l thought we could be human enough
to forgive that.

115
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,110
<i>Didn't he step up in time and take the blame?</i>

116
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,350
Well, l still think it was
very poor public relations...

117
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,519
...giving him his job back that way.

118
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,757
With all the headlines in this crazy,
mixed-up world...

119
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,995
...why would you want to open up
that tired old can of peas?

120
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,138
<i>l'll make a swap.</i>

121
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,037
What about your marriage?

122
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,353
ls this your answer?

123
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,148
<i>You've just done a very foolish thing.</i>

124
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,295
Thanks for the visit.
Be well and strong. God bless.

125
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,976
Hello.

126
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,771
Am l interrupting anything important?

127
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,447
-Hello, Mrs. Castle.
-Hello, Miss Benedict.

128
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,448
Hi, honey.

129
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,062
<i>l didn't know you were in the house.</i>

130
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,291
Well, l just came into town to shop.

131
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,469
-Hello, Marion.
-Hi, Buddy.

132
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,335
<i>You know there's innate power in the world, Bud,
needs publicity.</i>

133
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,807
What laundries do to sheets and pillowcases.

134
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,038
<i>-Every month l buy a dozen.
-Why don't you try the May Company?</i>

135
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,048
They sell a fine percale sheet
at a really modest price.

136
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,583
Tell me, Mrs. Castle,
do you and Charlie still use a double bed?

137
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,057
<i>Or is that a foolish question,
since you're separated now?</i>

138
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,556
<i>You are separated, aren't you?</i>

139
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,295
Patty, you sure take the cake for persistence.

140
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,765
<i>We're all sensible, sophisticated people.
There's no use wearing crepe.</i>

141
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,202
There were over 400,000 divorce cases
in this country last year.

142
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,805
<i>lt's getting as common as the ordinary head cold.</i>

143
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,138
You know, you may be right, Miss Benedict.

144
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,802
However, l find it sad.

145
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,106
And our personal life is not your affair.

146
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,884
<i>And you're the child who'll tell me.</i>

147
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,944
<i>l'm the one in this town who's not afraid
to tell you to mind your own business.</i>

148
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,656
<i>All right,
l'm glad we've come to an understanding.</i>

149
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,451
-Now, Patty--
-No, Chuck.

150
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,086
<i>l know when l've worn out my welcome.
l'm aware of that.</i>

151
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,528
<i>For Pete's sake!</i>

152
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,760
<i>Ace, you'd better do something,
or we'll all end up the creek.</i>

153
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,830
<i>Look, angel, what do you think you're doing?</i>

154
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,636
<i>She doesn't play Madam Fry with me,
not in my own house.</i>

155
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:14,875
Patty, wait!

156
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,515
<i>l'm in the movie business.</i>

157
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,450
<i>l can't afford your acute attacks of integrity.</i>

158
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,554
Oh, the way you talk to her!

159
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,385
<i>-How's that?
-Liquid honey.</i>

160
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,756
<i>-l'm insincere with her.
-Husband, be insincere with me.</i>

161
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,229
<i>Patty's got 18 million readers.
Why antagonize her? Where's the sense?</i>

162
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,062
From time to time,
l believe in being completely senseless.

163
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,931
<i>l'm a woman, not a diplomat.</i>

164
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,037
<i>The way you said ''God bless'' to that one!</i>

165
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,472
l should think
it would make you want to throw up.

166
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,373
<i>Of course, you're not sincere.</i>

167
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,043
How have you been?

168
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,612
Fine. Just fine.

169
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,521
<i>You know, l'm beginning to like this picture.</i>

170
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,154
Could make the Olympic team.

171
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,089
<i>You're right about this Rouault guy.</i>

172
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,861
<i>He broods. There's a certain quality.
l don't know.</i>

173
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,533
<i>l've been looking at it a lot the last few days.</i>

174
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,666
<i>Sometimes, when l'm alone lately...</i>

175
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,412
...an old clown waiting in the wings,
waiting to go on.

176
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,747
<i>Cut a few capers, knock 'em dead.</i>

177
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,287
<i>But he's done it a million times.</i>

178
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,784
<i>lt doesn't mean anything anymore.</i>

179
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,233
<i>-Too fortissimo?
-No.</i>

180
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,305
<i>l'd buy it all back.</i>

181
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,873
<i>How's Billy?</i>

182
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,717
<i>l haven't seen him for two weeks.</i>

183
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,344
-Three weeks.
-Okay, three weeks.

184
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,117
He has a cold.

185
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:07,993
Fever?

186
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,326
<i>But, you know, it hangs on.
You just can't keep him out of the ocean.</i>

187
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,571
-ls it lonely at the beach?
-Yes.

188
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,340
Very lonely?

189
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,173
<i>Charlie, don't start this, please.</i>

190
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,110
Come back, angel, l can change.

191
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,877
<i>How can you change?
You've been this way for so long.</i>

192
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,884
<i>l can. You've got to believe me on this.</i>

193
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,580
l have believed you before this,
any number of times.

194
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,648
<i>-You don't think those occasional girls--
-Yes, l do think those occasional girls!</i>

195
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,760
Surprised?

196
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,893
A man can live only one of two ways,
either married or like a bachelor.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,403
<i>What you want is the best of both!
And that's not a marriage, not in my book.</i>

198
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,733
Charlie Cass...

199
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,241
...he was a wonder.

200
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,577
l was Mrs. Cass.

201
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,141
<i>Now you're Hoff's Mr. Castle.</i>

202
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,780
<i>Come on. l don't buy that.</i>

203
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,952
<i>l don't belong to Stanley Hoff!</i>

204
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,455
<i>-No?
-No! l'm a free agent!</i>

205
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,526
Are you going to sign his new contract?

206
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,425
Marion, l want you to come back home to me.

207
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,261
-Just like that?
-Yes.

208
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,765
<i>l'm far from perfect,
but you're making a mistake...</i>

209
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,132
...if you think you can face
this big, wide world alone.

210
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,801
<i>Don't tell me you've got Billy,
because he still eats a grape in four bites.</i>

211
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,907
<i>Without me, you don't have a family.</i>

212
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,844
<i>You don't even have a friend,
unless it's Hank Teagle.</i>

213
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,513
Hank was my friend long before he was yours.

214
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,646
Hank asked me to marry him last night.

215
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,522
And?

216
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,881
What did you say?

217
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,955
What could l say?

218
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,996
<i>He's got his nerve.</i>

219
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,663
<i>-All he said was ''if.''
-lf?</i>

220
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,233
<i>l tried to avoid this conversation, didn't l?</i>

221
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,365
<i>Okay, you win.
Famous husband remarks, ''You win.''</i>

222
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,069
<i>Please, don't be such a housewife.</i>

223
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,546
Leave the lousy glasses alone!
We pay somebody to do that!

224
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,683
Russell!

225
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:23,862
Look.

226
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,459
The lousy strap is broken on my watch, too.

227
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,465
<i>l'll be needing a check for Monday.</i>

228
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,738
The bills are piling up.

229
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,539
<i>All right, l'll have Harold send it from the office.</i>

230
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,997
<i>Why, Mrs. Castle, l didn't hear you come in.</i>

231
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,497
-This is a real pleasure.
-Thank you, Russell.

232
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,327
Everything running all right?

233
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,372
Smooth as silk, Mrs. Castle. Just fine.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,566
<i>That's good. l'll see you before l leave.</i>

235
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,837
Thank you.

236
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,008
<i>-Would you mind taking this out?
-Yes, ma'am.</i>

237
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,125
Are you renewing with Hoff or not?

238
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,561
Where does Hank get the nerve
to propose to you?

239
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,828
<i>Forget about Hank.
He's leaving for New York in two weeks.</i>

240
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,458
To find a 40-cent gin?

241
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,039
<i>He's writing a new novel.
He's been on the wagon for weeks.</i>

242
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,776
Look, you say you want me
to come back to you.

243
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,477
<i>Well, believe me, l won't,
not ever, if you sign that contract.</i>

244
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,842
Oh, that again!

245
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:54,652
l never expected to see the day when
a firm deal would give you chills and fever!

246
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,213
Neither did l.

247
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,914
<i>l'm as human as the next one.</i>

248
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,823
<i>lt's a fabulous deal, but it's seven years,
and the life that comes with it....</i>

249
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,288
Or should l say the death that goes with it?

250
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,591
<i>Look at yourself. You're half-dead right now.</i>

251
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,065
<i>l haven't seen you sparkle in years.</i>

252
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,264
<i>You put on a show for other people,
but l'm your wife, l know it.</i>

253
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,467
Charlie, my Charlie...

254
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:21,910
<i>...what's happened to your mind,
your spirit, your soul?</i>

255
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,579
Charlie Cass, the guy l married....

256
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,913
He was a tiger. He liked to argue.

257
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,284
Because you believed in something...

258
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,686
...and what you believed in, you fought for.

259
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,652
And that was Charlie Cass.

260
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,356
What do you believe in now?

261
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,367
What do you want? The wild-eyed kid l was...

262
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:47,096
...nursing a cup of coffee in Walgreens,
yelling about the sad state of the theater?

263
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,907
<i>l'll tell you what l don't want.</i>

264
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,111
<i>l don't want one of those witless,
sold-out guys sitting around a gin table...</i>

265
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,248
...swapping phone numbers and the latest dirt!

266
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,416
How you talk.

267
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,077
<i>Charlie, l don't want you to sign that contract.</i>

268
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,721
You gave the studio their pound of flesh.

269
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:07,690
<i>l'm Hoff-Federated's biggest star.
l'm worth millions a year to them.</i>

270
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,624
<i>He won't let me go. You know why.</i>

271
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,491
<i>Tell him you're leaving Hollywood.</i>

272
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,588
Promise not to make pictures for anyone else.

273
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,792
<i>That's fine. What do l do? TV, a play?</i>

274
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,495
<i>The theater's a bleeding stump.
You've got to wait years for a decent part.</i>

275
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,998
And anyhow, what is all this arty bunk?

276
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,100
You know this industry is capable
of turning out good pictures...

277
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,872
...pictures with guts and meaning.

278
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,040
Sure, sure, you know some of the men who do it.

279
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,285
Stevens, Mankiewicz, Kazan, Huston...

280
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:40,290
...Wyler, Wilder, Stanley Kramer,
but never Stanley Hoff!

281
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,428
Never! Not once! Not for the life of him!

282
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,924
Not for all the pompous press statements!

283
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,698
<i>Stanley Hoff will personally produce
War and Peace by Tolstoy!</i>

284
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:51,963
<i>That'll be the day.</i>

285
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,767
Starring Charlie Castle
with a bull whip in one hand--

286
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:59,708
And a bleached blonde in the other.

287
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,478
Come here, please.

288
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,852
<i>Darling, there'll always be
Stanley Hoffs in this world.</i>

289
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,451
Not just in the movie industry, everywhere.

290
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:22,189
Always one who just has contempt
for decency and human dignity...

291
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,428
...and tries to drag you down with them.

292
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,103
Charlie, no.

293
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,836
<i>l'm Hoff's prisoner, angel,
and signing this contract is the ransom fee.</i>

294
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,912
<i>l didn't have the nerve that night.</i>

295
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,981
-l made the wrong decision.
-We made the wrong decision that night.

296
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,777
<i>l should've swung the other way.</i>

297
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,583
Darling, we both failed.

298
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,886
<i>l should've snapped out of my self-pity
and shoved you.</i>

299
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,620
<i>But we have a second chance.
lt's a gamble, l know.</i>

300
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,859
l know what Hoff can do if you refuse to sign.

301
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,367
You think you know.

302
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,296
<i>Charlie, he's only a man.</i>

303
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,374
<i>He's not God, to strike us down in his wrath.</i>

304
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,740
You really want to throw this away?

305
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,680
<i>l know l'm talking about your fabulous career
and all that goes with it...</i>

306
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,649
...but refuse him, Charlie, turn him down.

307
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:24,929
<i>l'll try.</i>

308
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,791
<i>l haven't actually agreed to sign.
l've been stalling for weeks, for months.</i>

309
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,896
<i>And Nat's coming by.
Maybe he can come up with a big idea.</i>

310
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,304
<i>l'm very fond of Nat.</i>

311
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,874
<i>He's good and kind...</i>

312
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,044
<i>...but you'll have to fight this one by yourself.</i>

313
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,340
lt may not work.

314
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,876
<i>lt's in your hands.</i>

315
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,390
We do love.... l mean....

316
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,457
<i>We do love each other, don't we?</i>

317
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,257
<i>That's the thing, the big thing.</i>

318
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,096
l need you.

319
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,894
l want you to tear Stanley Hoff apart, tiger.

320
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,797
-Hi, Nicky.
-Hello, Marion.

321
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,705
<i>l hope l'm not interrupting anything important.</i>

322
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,506
<i>You are, but it's all right.</i>

323
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,173
<i>lt's time for his rub, Marion.</i>

324
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,079
<i>-That can wait.
-No, it can't.</i>

325
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,742
<i>He'll be right out, Nicky.</i>

326
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,253
Tiger, l want you in condition, in the pink.

327
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,189
l have a million things to do,
and a household to move by suppertime.

328
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,453
-Household?
-Sure.

329
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,919
Me, Billy, the whole shebang.

330
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,665
<i>We're yours, aren't we?</i>

331
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,272
<i>l'll call you later.</i>

332
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,213
See you later.

333
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,175
Goodbye, Tiger.

334
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,774
Goodbye.

335
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,250
<i>Eighth Avenue, Jacob's Beach.</i>

336
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,190
<i>You and me, going to St. Nick's.</i>

337
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,665
Yeah, sure.

338
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,760
<i>There's your agent.</i>

339
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,866
What are you doing there, Nat, old kid?

340
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,129
Gentlemen!

341
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,400
What are you doing, Nat? What do you say?

342
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,146
<i>No, l'm greasy, you'll get all dirty.</i>

343
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,550
<i>Say, Nat, when l'm through, how about
me working that shoulder of yours?</i>

344
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:30,421
<i>Nicky, you're a sweetheart,
but the doctor says diathermy and shots.</i>

345
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:31,882
No friction.

346
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,249
Bursitis.

347
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,261
<i>What's the fashion in the industry? Ulcers.</i>

348
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,721
The rage.

349
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,126
l get bursitis.

350
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:46,128
But thank you, Nicky, you are
a true gentleman for wanting to help.

351
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,005
<i>Water when you're thirsty.</i>

352
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:55,307
Not to digress,
l saw your business manager this morning.

353
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,514
Harold?

354
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,979
<i>He says you're being a bad boy.
Checks he didn't approve.</i>

355
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,952
What am l supposed to do,
ask Eisenhower if l can slip a hungry rider $200?

356
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,921
<i>That's the least of my problems.</i>

357
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,255
Problems. Life is all problems. They work out.

358
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,157
<i>Well, l've got a honey for you, Nat.</i>

359
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,424
<i>Marion's dead set against the contract.</i>

360
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,031
<i>Her, l'm going to talk to.</i>

361
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,934
<i>You don't have to tell the old man.</i>

362
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,097
You two are such sweet mortals.

363
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,402
<i>l know she's a little hectic.</i>

364
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,604
<i>l don't want to sign it.
l'm afraid, if l do, it'll cost me my family.</i>

365
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,738
Look, Marion will cool down, Charlie.

366
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,682
<i>-l'll talk to her and you'll sign the--
-You don't hear one thing l say, do you?</i>

367
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,252
-Nothing.
-Darling, listen.

368
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,118
Listen? Why should l listen?
You never listen to me!

369
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,589
<i>l'm listening now.</i>

370
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,527
<i>l don't want to sign the contract!</i>

371
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,394
<i>-You don't?
-No, l don't.</i>

372
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,033
<i>-l thought you agreed to sign it.
-Listening doesn't mean agreement.</i>

373
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,598
<i>l listen to Stanley, l listen to you,
l listen till l'm blue in the face.</i>

374
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,008
But l did not agree to sign that contract.

375
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,346
<i>l can't keep doing those lousy pictures.</i>

376
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,414
<i>But it's in the contract, black on white.
You don't have to.</i>

377
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:15,619
l approve and make sure the scripts are good
before you even see them.

378
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:19,560
<i>This is Charlie ''Been-Around-a-Long-Time''
Castle you're talking to.</i>

379
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,324
Now, come on, give, think me a way out.

380
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,303
Well, darling, first l ought to tell you that...

381
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,171
...Stanley had me in his office
about the contract this morning...

382
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,737
<i>...for two hours, Hail Columbia...</i>

383
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,743
<i>...which leads to the fact
that they're dropping in here.</i>

384
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,216
-Here?
-Stanley Hoff and Smiley Coy.

385
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,616
-When?
-Any minute now.

386
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,693
<i>To invite you to the races,
but it's going to be a showdown.</i>

387
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,288
The alcohol.

388
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,054
<i>Nat, you've got to get me out of this.</i>

389
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,761
<i>Darling, l'm terribly worried.</i>

390
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,033
<i>Everybody has got the delusion
that you're very tough.</i>

391
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,805
They mix you up with the parts you play.

392
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,935
But l know you better.

393
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,340
<i>You're a special, idealistic type.</i>

394
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,118
<i>The only thing is,
business and idealism, they don't mix.</i>

395
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,652
<i>lt's oil and water.</i>

396
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,286
<i>A movie is not a movie to you, it's a gospel.</i>

397
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,951
<i>But you're mistaken, dear sir and friend, in all--</i>

398
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,427
Nat, shut up! Please, shut up!

399
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,055
Nicky, go up to the house. Go up to the house!

400
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,265
ls there anything a Greek can do?

401
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,575
Go up to the house, Nicky.
Let me know when they get here.

402
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,340
Thanks, character.

403
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,916
Charlie, a few important words.

404
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,326
We are not in a bargaining position
with Stanley...

405
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,093
<i>...but l'd do anything you ask me,
within my power...</i>

406
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,963
...as the good Lord sits above.

407
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,866
Just get me out of here, Nat.

408
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,934
<i>Stanley wouldn't let you go.</i>

409
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,506
Suppose l just tore up the contract,
and we moved away?

410
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,209
-What would he do?
-Yes. What would he do?

411
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,845
God forbid what he would do.

412
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,981
<i>Charlie, never underestimate a man
because you don't like him.</i>

413
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:27,423
l know Stanley since before
he had his fingers manicured every day.

414
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,584
What he would do....

415
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,797
<i>We've got no choice, Charlie.</i>

416
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,563
<i>You know what he's got on you.
That thing we don't talk about?</i>

417
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,205
You sign, or you go to jail.

418
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,838
<i>They're here!</i>

419
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,682
Mr. Hoff and Smiley Coy!

420
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,822
Every way is a way to die, huh?

421
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,097
<i>l'm older. Every way is a way to live.</i>

422
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,994
<i>l hope you're right, Nat.</i>

423
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,038
-Absolutely nothing.
-You know how it is, Mr. Hoff.

424
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,633
You know, some fighters, they get punchy,
so they hear things, but not me.

425
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,139
See you, Nick.

426
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,109
Two heads under one hat. What goes on here?

427
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,881
How are you, Stanley? Smiley?

428
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,257
<i>Nat's in my hair so frequently,
l don't say hello to him.</i>

429
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,225
<i>l didn't expect to find you here, Nat.</i>

430
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,923
<i>l just came in out of God's sunshine, that's all.</i>

431
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,599
<i>-How'd you wake up this morning, kitty?
-l didn't wake up, l came to.</i>

432
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,865
Fifteen minutes under a cold shower
before l could remember my name.

433
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,532
-Did you hear about Joe Ackerman?
-No. What?

434
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,435
Cancer.

435
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:56,204
Poor Joe, poor Martha.
l saw them only yesterday.

436
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,009
<i>l'll have to call there tonight.</i>

437
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,346
<i>That's a wonderful robe. Where'd you get it?</i>

438
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,849
<i>Nick Carroll's, l think.</i>

439
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,356
<i>That's a pleasure to feel next to your skin.</i>

440
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,559
-Smiley, you find me a few of those.
-Will do.

441
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,025
We request the pleasure of your company
at the races this afternoon.

442
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,760
<i>l don't think l can make it, Stanley.</i>

443
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,736
<i>l'm ready to bartend,
union regulations permitting.</i>

444
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,807
Stanley?

445
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,742
<i>l'll have a little sparkling water, please, Smiley.</i>

446
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,402
<i>Don't be an old fossil.</i>

447
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,242
<i>You'd enjoy the afternoon,
and we'd appreciate your company.</i>

448
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,475
<i>l'd like to, l really would, Stanley...</i>

449
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,582
...but the fact is, some friends from out of town,
friends of Marion--

450
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,714
You know how Charlie is,
always giving of himself.

451
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,725
<i>Marion, she's a wonderful girl.</i>

452
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:48,162
l hope for your reconciliation with her
as if you both were my own family.

453
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,766
Thank you very much.

454
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,803
lf we can express the divine will...

455
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,169
...and a happy marriage
is certainly such an expression...

456
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,573
...then we are really beginning
to live beyond our own selfish aims.

457
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,540
<i>That's very sweet of you, Stanley.</i>

458
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,082
<i>Since we're here on a friendly conclave,
how about the contract?</i>

459
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:11,087
<i>-Come on, now, it's growing whiskers.
-Well, l'm having trouble with it.</i>

460
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,647
<i>Trouble? What sort of trouble?
You tell me, l've got broad shoulders.</i>

461
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,726
Charlie, people can speak frankly to me.

462
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,229
<i>You're in a position which entitles you
to make the highest demands...</i>

463
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,562
...so, please, tell me your innermost thoughts.

464
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,602
<i>l don't want to sign the contract.</i>

465
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,300
-Have you talked this over with Marion?
-Yes.

466
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,879
<i>Well, you're still man and wife.</i>

467
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,445
Tree and bark.

468
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,990
<i>God's put that together, l can understand that.</i>

469
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,489
What does Marion want to see in the contract?

470
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,022
<i>lt isn't just Marion.</i>

471
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,062
We talked it over....

472
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,238
<i>l don't want to sign again.</i>

473
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,166
-Stanley, Charlie feels--
-No.

474
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,832
No, you let him answer.

475
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,439
<i>-Why?
-Well, it's the whole thing, Stanley.</i>

476
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,449
The whole idea of signing for that length of time.

477
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,251
Stanley, people can always speak
frankly with you...

478
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,687
<i>...and that's exactly what Charlie wants to do.</i>

479
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,551
What do you propose to do instead?

480
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,430
Well, l want to leave Hollywood.

481
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,600
<i>l'll sign anything guaranteeing you
l'll never make pictures again.</i>

482
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,432
<i>l've got nothing against you or Hoff-Federated.
lt's just that...</i>

483
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,070
<i>...l'm tired.</i>

484
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,972
l want to go away.

485
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,640
Sure, sure. l understand.

486
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,913
<i>l'll tell you what, you go on a layoff.
Six months, a year even.</i>

487
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,218
No, l want to go for good.

488
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,802
l see.

489
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,131
Charlie Castle, l easily recall to mind...

490
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,504
...our first meeting many, many years ago.

491
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,644
Do you remember what l said at that time?

492
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,542
Yes, some of the things.

493
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,347
<i>Please, you'll excuse me
for speaking with my eyes closed...</i>

494
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,418
...but it helps me see better.

495
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,118
<i>''l see a raw youth...</i>

496
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,885
<i>''...filled with that special vitality of talent.''</i>

497
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,529
l says, if memory serves:

498
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,264
<i>''Charlie Cass, you're going to be one
of the biggest stars in this business.</i>

499
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,165
<i>''Sure as there are little green apples...</i>

500
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,704
<i>''...you're going to run into
many, many problems.</i>

501
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,266
<i>''That's what l'm here for,'' l says.</i>

502
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,813
<i>''My advice is free, given with pleasure.</i>

503
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,342
<i>''l may not always be able to help...</i>

504
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,351
<i>''...but probably more than not.''</i>

505
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,560
You came to see me more than once.

506
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,531
-True?
-Yes, true, true.

507
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:19,766
Stanley, Charlie has always had
great respect for your judgment.

508
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,308
Adulation, even.

509
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,305
<i>l'm skipping the years of coolness between us.</i>

510
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,944
You came to my office no more.
The reason why, l never will understand.

511
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,216
But nevertheless, l was there for you and yours...

512
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:37,317
...and the vexing problems that are
so manifold in the heat and toil of the day.

513
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,557
Then, on a certain night, in this very room,
the law spelled scandal.

514
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,035
l was there for you then, too.

515
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,101
Charlie, l want to tell you a little story.

516
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,907
<i>Charles, l'd like to tell you a little story.
lt may concern you.</i>

517
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,009
For a number of years...

518
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,644
...the woman that was my wife....

519
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,223
Certain facts came home to me.
That was the year of the merger.

520
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,190
These facts came up, as l said.

521
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,357
My wife...

522
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,965
...drinking...

523
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,065
...certain scenes...

524
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,028
...certain hotel room in New York City...

525
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:24,873
...attempted suicides.

526
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,710
l was out of my mind.

527
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,937
But we brought her back that time.

528
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,407
Smiley was good enough
to enter my employ the year before.

529
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,451
lt all added up to one fact!

530
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,780
Psychoanalysis! Psychoanalysis!

531
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:46,190
$30,000 or $40,000 down the drain in one year,
but not begrudged.

532
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:53,103
<i>l thought to amuse her.
l bought her a pleasure boat, the Alberta.</i>

533
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,839
Named after her, too.

534
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,906
Nothing helped. Nothing.

535
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,410
Then one day in my office,
Frank Lubner was there...

536
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,951
...a pioneer in the industry, Smiley Coy...

537
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,582
...l drank a light scotch and soda,
and l began to cry.

538
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,351
<i>And l hadn't cried like that since l was a boy.</i>

539
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:23,565
Because l saw, through a revelation of pain,
that my wife was determined...

540
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,001
...in her innermost mind
to destroy me and my career...

541
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,040
...out of willful, malicious jealousy.

542
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,875
You ask me why? l ask you why.

543
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,571
But from that day on...

544
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,281
...l realized one essential fact of life!

545
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,814
<i>The woman must stay out
of her husband's work...</i>

546
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,079
...when he earns her bread and butter.

547
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,967
The wife of a man in your position...

548
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,995
...should have the regard...

549
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:05,200
...and should have the respect
to help him advance his career.

550
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,507
<i>Don't you think?</i>

551
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,244
Charlie, you can have anything l own.

552
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,313
The pain of this moment...

553
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,085
...the memories....

554
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,830
l understand how you feel.

555
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,196
Gentlemen...

556
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,866
...l apologize.

557
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,138
We understand, Stanley.

558
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,107
Hear me, Stanley.

559
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,778
<i>Charlie's main worry in the past,
and it's a commendable thing in itself...</i>

560
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,445
...he wants to make better pictures.

561
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,184
<i>l meant what l said.
l'm not bargaining with you, Stanley.</i>

562
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,556
<i>You're not in a bargaining position!</i>

563
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,959
<i>But it's true, l can't force you to sign, can l?</i>

564
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,826
<i>That's just what you're trying to do!</i>

565
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,092
Shut up, Nat!

566
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,829
<i>l'm going to have to take this very much amiss.</i>

567
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,235
l offer you my hand, and you spit in my face.

568
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,869
No, no, Stanley, Charlie--

569
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,847
<i>Stanley, l want you to let me go.
We don't like each other.</i>

570
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,408
l know that, you know it.

571
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,647
<i>l'll promise you anything you want
if you'll just let me go.</i>

572
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,718
Stanley, please, listen to him.

573
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,258
<i>He's asking this from the bottom of his soul.</i>

574
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,761
Shut up!

575
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,726
Charles, l solemnly adjure realism.

576
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,900
l need your physical presence on the lot.

577
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,576
l need your body, not your goodwill.

578
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,336
Now, Charlie, l want you to sign this paper...

579
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,348
...with one of the pens that ended World War ll.

580
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,744
This was used by a great American,
General Douglas MacArthur.

581
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,393
<i>l can't tell you how many long months
of constructive dreaming...</i>

582
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,056
...have gone in this moment...

583
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,603
...and l will let nobody, or nothing,
stand in the way of that dream.

584
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,269
<i>l'm asking you for the last time...</i>

585
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,173
...please, let me go.

586
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,212
<i>l can't force you to sign, can l?</i>

587
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,421
Can l?

588
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,813
Congratulations, kitty.

589
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,081
<i>The copy's Charlie's.</i>

590
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,985
<i>l'll keep the pen.</i>

591
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,692
<i>lt's my only proof that the war is over...</i>

592
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,057
...or that it was ever fought.

593
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,062
Charles, we all love you.

594
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:21,564
<i>You're a great artist, so we must learn
to expect these temperamental actions.</i>

595
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,670
From now on, Charlie,
your problems are my problems.

596
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,443
Never hesitate to call.
Your slightest wish, your worry....

597
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,709
<i>What's with you tonight, kitty?</i>

598
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,975
A certain party finds itself very fascinated.

599
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:42,020
<i>Yeah, but like l said, l'm all tied up.</i>

600
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,528
Sure, kitty.

601
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,892
<i>-Nat, l'm driving by your office.
-No, thank you, l'm going to Culver City.</i>

602
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,173
Goodbye, Nat.

603
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,176
Darling, l know how you feel.

604
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,918
The old man knows.

605
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,024
He twisted my neck like l was a 10-cent rag doll.

606
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,293
<i>lt's not so terrible as you're making out.</i>

607
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,122
Like l was a little rag doll.

608
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,926
<i>You're making a whole tsimmes
out of a simple basic fact.</i>

609
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,396
Seven years of financial security.

610
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,576
Darling, take the long view.

611
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,814
What could l do?

612
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,502
See you, Nat.

613
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,601
Hello?

614
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,908
Sure, Marion. Right here.

615
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,029
Hello, angel.

616
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,334
Marion, wait.

617
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,974
l think you ought to know, Hoff was here.

618
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,715
l lost.

619
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,076
Yes, that....

620
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,451
Hello?

621
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,261
Drinking by yourself, Charlie? Secret vices?

622
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,929
Look what the wind blew in. Mrs. Bliss.

623
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,502
<i>lsn't Buddy here? His secretary said he was.</i>

624
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,506
-l need a drink, Charlie.
-Help yourself.

625
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,686
-Marion still at the beach?
-Yeah.

626
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,597
You should keep your door locked, Charlie.

627
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,633
You could be kidnapped
and held for a delicious ransom.

628
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:53,038
<i>l think l'll have some Tequila.
Tequila always makes me frisky.</i>

629
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,503
You want some more Tequila, Charlie?

630
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,578
-Where did you come from, frisky miss?
-Lunch at Pescotti.

631
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,985
With that second-class neurotic, Walden?

632
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,056
<i>-How'd you know?
-Small town.</i>

633
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,361
My baby.

634
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,940
Right here.

635
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,044
<i>You've cornered me at 20 different parties.</i>

636
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,974
<i>Why do you always sniff me out when l'm drunk?</i>

637
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,247
-Are you drunk, Charlie?
-Stewed to the gills.

638
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:43,554
The red neon lights are on
and the sky is full of drunken blackbirds.

639
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,026
So drink your drink and get out of here.

640
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,829
Why stand on formality, Charlie?
l find you very attractive.

641
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,405
<i>You don't care
what you do to your husband, do you?</i>

642
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,374
Do you?

643
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,938
That hurts, boyfriend. You hurt me, darling.

644
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,413
<i>l'm a naughty girl.
l wish l could say l didn't like it.</i>

645
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:12,952
Go home, Connie.

646
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,648
Your mother wants you.

647
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,958
<i>Life's a sweet thing, isn't it, Charlie?</i>

648
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,601
<i>That's something Buddy will never understand.</i>

649
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,001
Look, l like Buddy.

650
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,572
Last year, l almost left Buddy.

651
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:38,044
But then that terrible thing came up...

652
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,343
...and, of course, l had to play my part...

653
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,614
...especially since it all got so involved.

654
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,157
<i>-What do you mean, ''involved''?
-Stop it, Charlie.</i>

655
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,090
<i>Don't you think l know
that Buddy went to prison for you?</i>

656
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,996
<i>Don't you think l know that
you killed that child in the auto accident...</i>

657
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,358
...not Buddy?

658
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,997
Buddy told you that?

659
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,936
<i>You're the hero of the world to Buddy.
He'd go to prison for you, but tell his wife?</i>

660
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,380
No, that handsome Smiley Coy
called twice that night.

661
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,276
<i>He's very important.
Now, why would he call Buddy?</i>

662
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:23,088
-So l just put two and two together--
-And you got a crooked five.

663
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:28,527
<i>Get organized, Charlie. You're drunk.</i>

664
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,259
l know, l know.

665
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:35,202
<i>That's when l come around,
and then there's me and what you said:</i>

666
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:40,742
<i>''Red neon lights
and a sky full of drunken blackbirds.''</i>

667
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,748
<i>This liquor's got me in a hurry.</i>

668
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,189
<i>Don't fight it, darling.</i>

669
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,020
Get with it.

670
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,135
Hello?

671
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,149
<i>Gee, l don't know, Buddy.</i>

672
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,556
<i>What makes you think that she'd be here?</i>

673
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:35,926
<i>lt's early yet.</i>

674
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,768
She could be out in a store somewhere
squandering your loot.

675
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,109
<i>Don't just sit in the house, Ace.</i>

676
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,276
Get out, find yourself a bar, sauce up.

677
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:52,782
Sure.

678
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:57,650
<i>That's Dr. Castle's prescription
for the blue grumps anytime.</i>

679
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,383
<i>No, wait, Buddy. No, you can't come here.</i>

680
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:08,488
<i>l'm going out in about two minutes.
l've got to see a fellow.</i>

681
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,097
<i>Look, she'll probably walk in
as soon as l hang up...</i>

682
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,198
...which is going to be right now.

683
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,238
<i>No, don't thank me, Buddy.</i>

684
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,314
Yeah, l know.

685
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:29,414
<i>Oh, yes, l know, l know. l know l'm a swell guy!</i>

686
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,917
Get out of here!

687
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,717
You hurt me again, darling.

688
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,297
<i>But you like that, don't you?</i>

689
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,366
<i>There's a word for you.</i>

690
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,533
<i>Why don't you say it, darling?</i>

691
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,539
<i>-You'd better get out of here before l--
-l know.</i>

692
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,545
l know, l know.

693
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,077
Look, what are you?

694
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,116
No, l mean, seriously.

695
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,784
Just what do you believe in? What?

696
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,927
Fun, Charlie, not gloomy thoughts.

697
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,127
Perfume and staying young...

698
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,196
...and goodies of every sort
and description...

699
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,832
...secrets and locked doors...

700
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:29,669
...and enjoying the wildest things
that come into my mind.

701
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:45,354
<i>Why don't you go home, Connie?
Your mother's looking for you.</i>

702
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,698
<i>l'll go home, Charlie, in a little while.</i>

703
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,325
ln a little while.

704
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:56,065
You do that, you do that little thing,
because l have big trouble.

705
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,437
<i>l don't need you for more trouble.</i>

706
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:02,605
Getting sloshed in my own mud and neon lights.

707
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,828
-Hello, Marion.
-Hi, Nicky.

708
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,791
<i>lt's all right, but don't be too long.
He has to have his lunch.</i>

709
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:59,301
-Billy, see you later.
-Goodbye.

710
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,450
-He got over his cold okay, huh?
-Last week.

711
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,321
-l called you six or seven times.
-l know.

712
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,988
You buried me deep, angel.

713
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,493
Listen, would you do me a big favor?

714
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,429
-What?
-Come to dinner tonight.

715
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,299
-You mean at the house?
-Yeah.

716
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,300
l have to do something for Buddy.

717
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,875
<i>He's been avoiding me
since that Patty Benedict bit.</i>

718
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,878
<i>He thinks he let me down or something.
l don't know.</i>

719
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,641
<i>He's in trouble with the front office.</i>

720
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,044
Hank asked me to have dinner with him tonight.

721
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,444
Well, bring him along.

722
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,460
<i>-l've invited the Blisses for 7:00.
-All right, we'll be there at 6:30.</i>

723
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:04,089
<i>Because l'm coming to dinner at the house,
it doesn't mean anything.</i>

724
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:05,700
Natch.

725
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,833
All right, into your corner.

726
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,233
...three, four...

727
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,642
...five, six...

728
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,216
<i>...seven, eight, nine....</i>

729
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,292
<i>Come on, break it up.</i>

730
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:38,868
<i>Break it up.</i>

731
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,554
<i>Nine, ten and you're out.</i>

732
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,072
That was a great picture, huh, boy?

733
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,376
Hey, Charlie, who was that guy? Was that Cass?

734
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,713
Yeah. Ralph was referee, too, remember.

735
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,788
<i>Who's drink wants sweetening?
Marion? Connie?</i>

736
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,320
<i>Hank, why don't you break down?</i>

737
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,790
<i>lt's getting so l almost like this stuff.</i>

738
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,384
<i>Hey, aren't we all going next door
to Monty's party?</i>

739
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,329
<i>Connie, you'll have to excuse me.
l've got a rotten headache.</i>

740
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,127
Oh, what a shame.

741
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,397
<i>Yeah, you kids run along.
Maybe we'll catch up with you later.</i>

742
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,799
Okay, handsome.

743
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,433
-Should we walk or drive?
-Drive.

744
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,637
Leave a lot of cars out front,
and the drunks will be dropping in all night.

745
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:58,441
-How old is that picture?
-Eight, nine years.

746
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,345
-Why?
-Hey, you had a lot of steam.

747
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,781
He certainly did.

748
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,150
-See you later, faithless.
-Faithless?

749
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,055
Thanks, Charles.

750
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,719
-Good night, Marion.
-Good night, Connie.

751
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,226
-Good night, Hank.
-Good night.

752
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,392
What did you think of the picture, Hank?

753
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,630
<i>l kept wondering what would've happened
if you lost the big fight.</i>

754
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:25,697
<i>Un-commercial. Kid still thinks
he's writing for Mercury and the group...</i>

755
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,707
<i>...but it turned out
to what Uncle Hoff described as ''disahster.''</i>

756
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,980
What did you think of it?

757
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,949
l liked it the first time, in spite of the ending.

758
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,519
Well, you grieve for the past like a weeping bird.

759
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,883
When are you leaving, Hank?

760
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,391
l mean, leaving Hollywood.

761
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,652
Tuesday or Wednesday.

762
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,991
<i>l'd like to see you before you go.
How about Monday?</i>

763
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,825
-Any time you say.
-Okay, Monday.

764
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:55,628
<i>-What are you doing?
-Hank's driving me back to the beach.</i>

765
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,542
<i>Do you have to go now?
l mean, it's early, 12:30 or so.</i>

766
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,205
<i>Can't we sit down and talk or something?</i>

767
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,942
<i>l'm sorry, Charlie, but you know where that leads.</i>

768
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,445
Darling....

769
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,380
<i>l thought maybe the three of us,
we'd just sit around and yack it up a bit.</i>

770
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,718
<i>Please, don't go.</i>

771
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:18,089
<i>Look, if you want to yack it up,
why don't you go over to Monty's?</i>

772
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,187
<i>-There's lots of bright types there for you.
-Take it easy, dear.</i>

773
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,266
<i>Take it easy? That's where the trouble began.</i>

774
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,697
Come on, now, be yourself.

775
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:28,965
<i>That's another local remark, which means,
''Be just like me, don't be yourself.''</i>

776
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:33,306
<i>-Stay and have just one more drink.
-l don't need another one, thanks.</i>

777
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,339
-Hank, how about another cup of coffee?
-No thanks, Charlie, up to here.

778
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:43,350
<i>Did you ever hear Smiley's story
about the coffee bean and the water plant?</i>

779
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,161
Marion tells me that you asked her to marry you.

780
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:56,832
Yes, l did.

781
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,961
Let me get this straight.

782
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,295
<i>-Aren't you my friend?
-Yes, Charlie--</i>

783
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,065
Then what is this routine?

784
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,839
Marion makes me want to live.

785
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,369
Most people affect me differently.

786
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:14,513
<i>Look, Charlie, l'm sorry you're unhappy,
but you lost her years ago.</i>

787
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,210
<i>ln fairness, you can't blame me.</i>

788
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,288
<i>l don't feel fair tonight.
Where did you stash your angel wings?</i>

789
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,584
Who gave you the right to make such a decision?

790
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,319
My only right is to make my own decisions.

791
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,953
That speech is right off the couch.

792
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,931
<i>Get this straight, dreamboy.
Marion isn't going to leave me.</i>

793
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,694
l make my own decisions, too.

794
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,628
No, l want to go home.

795
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,672
Marion, would you let me say 10 words?

796
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,308
<i>l think it'll be easier if l wait in the car.</i>

797
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,049
<i>l'm sorry.</i>

798
00:54:56,993 --> 00:55:00,258
Sometimes l rant and rave
as though l had something against you.

799
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,523
<i>But you've been good to me, so good to me.</i>

800
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,527
<i>You're only good to me.</i>

801
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,342
This is all a bleak, bitter dream...

802
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:22,009
...a real dish of doves.

803
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:27,752
You come in here and throw this nest of
naked pigeons in my face, what can l do?

804
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,282
There are only two ways to forget everything.

805
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,328
You either get drunk,
or you just stick a pencil in your eye.

806
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,763
<i>Charlie, l'm seeing a lawyer in the morning.</i>

807
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,633
<i>Marion, please, don't leave me.</i>

808
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,603
<i>l swear, l'm innocent, angel.</i>

809
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:49,845
<i>l swear that while l'm charming the world
with my light fantastic...</i>

810
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,445
<i>...l'm bleeding to death under my shirt.</i>

811
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:59,986
<i>Can't you wait with the lawyer, angel?</i>

812
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,583
Am l the worst oaf in the world?

813
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,487
<i>The world's a big place.</i>

814
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,999
<i>You're the worst one in my life.</i>

815
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,620
Thank you.

816
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,855
Do want me to take you back?

817
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,921
Marion, you know l love you.

818
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,896
<i>l'll do anything for your happiness...</i>

819
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,798
...but please, stop playing both ends
against the middle.

820
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,500
<i>l don't mean to.</i>

821
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,797
<i>Then let's face the basic problem.</i>

822
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,808
lt boils down to a simple fact.

823
00:56:57,113 --> 00:57:00,105
Either you still love him
and you want to live with him...

824
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:03,411
<i>...or you don't love him
and you don't want to live with him.</i>

825
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:10,084
<i>Charlie, please, don't worry. lt'll all work out.</i>

826
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,222
-Nicky, do me a favor.
-Sure, Charlie.

827
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,063
Get me my robe and a blanket.

828
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,867
<i>-l don't want to sleep up there tonight.
-Sure.</i>

829
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,475
<i>lf you're in trouble...</i>

830
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:38,011
<i>...if there's anything old Nick can do,
anything....</i>

831
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,320
Anybody home?

832
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,954
<i>l don't hear a thing, not a thing.</i>

833
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,425
Where did you come from? Next door?

834
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,462
Yeah. Monty Ritz. A real bash.

835
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:54,394
<i>-Funny, you couldn't hear it in here.
-Marion had the door closed.</i>

836
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,572
lt sounds wild.

837
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,665
All the types. You know Monty.

838
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,535
Busted with the girls?

839
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,404
Everything.

840
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,812
-How you feeling, kitty?
-Blue.

841
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,777
<i>Like my dear baby's eyes.</i>

842
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,911
-What did you think of Tess?
-Tess?

843
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,616
-Last night.
-Oh, the redhead.

844
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,956
She was built, but....

845
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,061
<i>l don't know, l wasn't in the mood.
l think l lost a fan.</i>

846
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,698
l came home and read for an hour.

847
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:29,670
<i>-What are you reading?
-l don't remember from one day to another.</i>

848
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,666
<i>l saw Tommy Murdock's new picture
this afternoon.</i>

849
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,777
-Yeah, how was it?
-Disaster.

850
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:42,318
Cards or chess, or shall l take
another $100 from you in Scrabble?

851
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,280
<i>No, let's sit this one out.</i>

852
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,485
What are you dreaming about?

853
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:51,290
<i>l'm homesick for the east, the four seasons.</i>

854
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,891
-How old are you, Smiley?
-A million.

855
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,892
But young enough, to my surprise...

856
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:03,097
...to still be losing my temper
with a tramp like Dixie Evans.

857
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,268
<i>-What's wrong now?
-Her mouth's too big.</i>

858
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,876
<i>She's over at Monty's party, drunk.</i>

859
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,747
<i>''There he is,'' she says.</i>

860
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:17,580
l turn around, and there she sits,
cute as a skinned parboiled ham.

861
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,385
<i>''We know something, Smiley and me, don't we?''
she says.</i>

862
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,892
<i>l've been trying to get Marion
to come back to me.</i>

863
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,393
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

864
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:30,694
<i>That's all l need, for her to find out
l had a girl in the car the night of the accident.</i>

865
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,268
<i>Dixie's been hinting like that
in quite a few spots.</i>

866
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:36,461
-You think she means any harm?
-Who knows? Harm.

867
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,535
<i>She's always liked you, kitty.</i>

868
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,040
Call her up, have her come over. Laugh a little.

869
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:43,237
Are you worried?

870
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,838
What have you got to be worried about?
You can do a thousand things.

871
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,108
Name one.

872
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,512
-Buy her off.
-We did, with a contract.

873
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,982
<i>She's dishonest. She won't stay bought.</i>

874
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:58,159
-Call her over, kitty.
-All right.

875
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,398
Anything for my art.

876
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,165
Women, women, women.

877
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,568
<i>lt's Monty's little girl singing.</i>

878
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,566
Nice voice.

879
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,508
You should see her.

880
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,011
Cute?

881
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,704
A barracuda.

882
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:23,208
Hello? ls Miss Dixie Evans there?

883
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:28,385
Evans. Yes. Would you get her, please?

884
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,122
<i>Sounds like they're shooting off guns
or something.</i>

885
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,196
Bongos.

886
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,629
-A lot of women there?
-Loaded.

887
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,094
What do you think of women, kitty?

888
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,773
<i>There's room in the world for them.</i>

889
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,209
Dixie?

890
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,373
<i>l can't hear you. Who?</i>

891
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,984
<i>Really? You're not ribbing me?</i>

892
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,286
Knock it off, will you, honey?

893
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,949
No, not you, Charlie.

894
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,617
<i>There's somebody here with me.</i>

895
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,696
<i>Sure, it's a great party. Yeah, yeah.</i>

896
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,889
<i>There's so much noise here.</i>

897
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,297
<i>-Would you please get him to stop?
-lt's all right.</i>

898
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:16,429
<i>-No, l have a very important call.
-lt's all right, honey, he'll be quiet.</i>

899
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,041
Gee, Charlie, a swim in your pool now?

900
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,202
<i>l'd love to.</i>

901
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,006
Listen, how do l get there?

902
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,278
Yeah?

903
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,210
Look, will you cut it out, please, honey?

904
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,453
<i>Look, l'll take Monty's car.</i>

905
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,715
Yeah, you know l never walk anywhere.

906
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,151
Yeah, right away. Pronto.

907
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,386
<i>l'd love to.</i>

908
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,296
Of all the types!

909
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:46,865
<i>The first nice thing that's happened to me
in a month of Tuesdays.</i>

910
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:52,608
Bye, honey.

911
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:57,775
<i>Be careful what you say to Dixie, Charlie.
Don't give her any more ammunition.</i>

912
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,280
Listen, have you offered to buy her contract up?

913
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,351
Two months ago. Nothing.

914
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,981
<i>-You mean she's been blabbing that long?
-Longer.</i>

915
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,715
The stupid little tramp.
Two bits worth of nothing with a little power.

916
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:15,264
<i>-She doesn't want more money?
-She doesn't know what she wants.</i>

917
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,862
<i>l'm betting even money, we have to get rid of her.</i>

918
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,992
Fine. How do you work that?

919
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,046
-Good night, Charlie.
-Good night.

920
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,013
How do you work that?

921
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,560
<i>There's no standard procedure.</i>

922
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,524
What do you do, ship her east?

923
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,630
<i>Charlie, she's all mouth, all gab.</i>

924
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:53,796
<i>So we've got to get it fixed
she never opens her mouth again.</i>

925
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,402
<i>Well, let's wait and see the developments.</i>

926
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,640
l think l can talk to her.

927
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,506
<i>l'm a little fuzzy tonight.</i>

928
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:11,348
<i>You know, you're saying funny things, Smiley,
but l don't see you smiling.</i>

929
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,414
<i>What do you mean,
''she never opens her mouth again?''</i>

930
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,150
<i>-That's it.
-What's it?</i>

931
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,986
<i>Charlie, she'll have to be removed.</i>

932
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,432
Removed?

933
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,431
Sorry to throw the raw meat on the floor.

934
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,139
A fact, like a rock,
has certain dimensions and gravity.

935
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,740
<i>l've gone over all the choices, one by one.</i>

936
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,472
<i>You'd make a great actor.</i>

937
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,913
<i>-Life's a queer little man, kitty.
-Yeah, kitty.</i>

938
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,617
-What does Stanley know about this?
-Only what he wants to know.

939
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:50,152
<i>There's a reason he pays me $75,000 a year.</i>

940
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:57,362
<i>-You know, for a minute there, l thought--
-Charles, you're a fanciful type.</i>

941
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,132
ln my end of the business,
you have to know types.

942
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,533
Take your type.

943
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:05,232
The warrior minstrel with a forlorn hope.

944
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,067
<i>That's you, doll.</i>

945
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,612
<i>That's Dixie. l'll slide out the back way.</i>

946
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,247
<i>''Warrior minstrel with the forlorn hope.''
Wait.</i>

947
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,980
<i>What's that from?</i>

948
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,017
<i>lt's a phrase the lrish used to understand.</i>

949
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,987
<i>You know me, l'm from those cynical Celts.</i>

950
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,185
ldeals, kitty? Nowadays?

951
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,519
A lost crusade.

952
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:32,000
<i>Don't study life, Charlie. Get used to it.</i>

953
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,627
You changed the subject.

954
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,433
You bothering to remember
everything l said tonight?

955
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,065
Pleasant dreams, kitty.

956
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,305
Smiley, listen....

957
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,287
<i>The door wasn't locked, so l walked right in.</i>

958
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,387
Long time, no see, Charlie.

959
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,094
Well, wash my mouth out with whiskey.

960
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:18,979
<i>l'm drinking brandy.</i>

961
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,507
<i>lf l take one more drink, l'll see a snake.</i>

962
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,155
<i>Take a light one. Don't be silly.</i>

963
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,024
All right, you masochist.

964
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,494
Give me a scotch and soda.

965
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,634
l know.

966
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,174
<i>How did you know l was at Monty's party?</i>

967
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,411
Radar.

968
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,278
<i>Oh, you're a faker.</i>

969
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,312
<i>You're very sweet, but l don't trust you.</i>

970
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,445
Listen.

971
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,282
<i>-Who's at home?
-Only the crickets.</i>

972
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:06,928
<i>-Why don't you like me anymore?
-l like you, Dixie.</i>

973
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,192
<i>l haven't seen you since that very day...</i>

974
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,297
...l sat in this here chair with you
and your agents.

975
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,996
Then l shocked them
when l asked for my contract.

976
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,837
<i>Old Nat's been around, honey.</i>

977
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,035
And that whole big studio...

978
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:24,112
...when l think of some of the things
they do and say....

979
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,469
Such as?

980
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,550
<i>You've got to be a girl
with a good figure to know.</i>

981
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:33,951
And some of those guys on a rainy afternoon....

982
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,519
<i>l'd like to brain them.</i>

983
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,028
<i>Did you know that l'm perfectly proportioned?</i>

984
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,098
<i>-Well, aren't l?
-Yes.</i>

985
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,866
Of course, l understand now
that temperament is much more important...

986
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,403
...than shape and size.

987
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,631
<i>But it's like l still won't get glasses.</i>

988
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,436
<i>You know, l can't see across the street.
But glasses are ugly, aren't they?</i>

989
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,044
Who wound me up?

990
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:03,376
<i>So why don't l see you more often
in my young and thrilling life?</i>

991
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:06,580
<i>Here, have a shot of Dr. Castle's pain killer.</i>

992
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:09,190
Snake oil.

993
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,128
<i>l don't care if l do see a snake.</i>

994
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,461
<i>l'm sure l'd much rather see a snake
than a Hollywood producer.</i>

995
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,169
Who invented soda? How do they make it?

996
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,332
What a weirdie.

997
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:27,271
<i>You're the only one who can call me that.</i>

998
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,875
<i>l'll tell you why.</i>

999
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,044
l like you, Charlie.

1000
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,313
<i>You've been very kind and considerate to me.</i>

1001
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,786
And that is a very special matter
in my special memory box.

1002
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,959
<i>l'm going to get a dog.</i>

1003
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:45,460
A poodle.

1004
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:48,461
Do you like poodles?

1005
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,290
Big or little?

1006
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,261
<i>l'll tell you why.</i>

1007
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,298
When l was 16,
my family threw me out of the house.

1008
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,930
That makes you very nervous.

1009
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,732
l mean a thing like that makes you very touchy.

1010
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,406
They just kind of gave me up for lost.

1011
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:11,650
<i>To this very day, my mother can't tell my father
that l send them money.</i>

1012
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,019
Catholics believe in large families.

1013
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,459
<i>But l'll tell you what. l'm saving my money now.</i>

1014
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,891
<i>l'm waiting for Mr. Right to come along.</i>

1015
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,589
lf l ever meet the guy around here.

1016
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,268
My name is mud in Hollywood.

1017
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,433
-Hey, am l boring you?
-No, honey, no.

1018
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:34,239
l like to hear you talk honest.

1019
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,642
<i>l know what you're trying to do, Charlie.</i>

1020
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,005
What?

1021
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,383
Make me forget about the swim you promised me.

1022
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:46,453
<i>They'd drown me if they could, that studio.</i>

1023
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:48,484
Why?

1024
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,525
l needle them.

1025
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:56,094
l keep hinting about your accident.
lt makes them nervous for a change.

1026
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,631
You want to be careful.

1027
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,530
<i>Hoff's a man with a crocodile's temper.</i>

1028
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,005
<i>Don't tell me about Mr. Hoff.</i>

1029
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:08,634
Calling me a child one minute,
and without even changing his face....

1030
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,510
<i>You don't see those people
from the bottom, like l do, Charlie.</i>

1031
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,150
<i>You're a successful self-made man.</i>

1032
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,989
<i>Why don't you give me a break, please?</i>

1033
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,418
Sure, Charlie, dear. How?

1034
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,290
Every time that you talk
about the accident, you know--

1035
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,864
<i>Charlie, don't be like that.</i>

1036
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,898
You have nothing to be afraid of from me.

1037
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,894
<i>l don't talk in my sleep.</i>

1038
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,600
<i>-So don't worry.
-But l am worried, dimples.</i>

1039
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,477
<i>Some night,
you'll have a skinful and inadvertently--</i>

1040
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,170
<i>But l've got a skinful now...</i>

1041
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,443
<i>...and l didn't tell you anything
you didn't know already, did l?</i>

1042
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,652
Like about Sammy Burke for instance.
Now, he took this girl....

1043
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,515
<i>You're telling me now.</i>

1044
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,723
<i>That's because you asked me.</i>

1045
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,165
<i>No. l didn't ask you.</i>

1046
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:10,438
<i>l'm only giving you an example.
Charlie, dear, l know where to stop.</i>

1047
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,436
<i>But l don't see any reason
to make it easy on them.</i>

1048
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,438
l hate them.

1049
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:22,447
<i>You know it says ''actress'' on my contract,
but they hired me for my figure, not to act.</i>

1050
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,018
<i>But you've been acting.</i>

1051
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,378
Those bits?

1052
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:30,052
Three cigarette girls in two whole years.
You call that acting?

1053
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,655
<i>''Big part coming up. Testing you next week.</i>

1054
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,960
<i>''Won't you come out to dinner?''</i>

1055
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,563
And next week never comes.

1056
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:43,704
Charlie, they hire girls like me
to entertain the visiting exhibitors.

1057
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,973
We know how to stand, to dress.

1058
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,311
The clothes come out of wardrobe.

1059
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,373
<i>lt's cheaper than if they....</i>

1060
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,506
<i>l'm a deductible item.</i>

1061
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:58,352
They write me off the books.

1062
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,888
<i>Listen to uncle, collie dog.
Why don't you go back--</i>

1063
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,890
That lousy studio!

1064
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:06,055
They louse you up,
and then they call you a louse!

1065
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,532
Honest, Charlie...

1066
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,007
<i>...wouldn't you be mad?</i>

1067
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,839
Sure l would.

1068
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,238
Well, there. See?

1069
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,622
Look at this bit.

1070
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,052
<i>lt's what l learned.</i>

1071
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,289
Dearie...

1072
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,956
...where is the swimming pool
you promised me?

1073
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,168
Here. Coming right up.

1074
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,935
Filled with brandy.

1075
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:53,869
Because the baby,
she cannot be kept waiting.

1076
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:00,973
ls there somebody standing there?

1077
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,860
This is my wife.

1078
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,325
Miss Evans.

1079
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,504
Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Castle.

1080
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,805
We were having a conversation.

1081
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,136
<i>Well, l've got to get back
to Monty's party now, Charlie.</i>

1082
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:36,439
Thanks for the drink
and the advice about my career.

1083
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,609
Sure, Dixie.

1084
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,353
Thanks for coming over.

1085
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,683
<i>lt's been very pleasant.</i>

1086
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,628
l meant everything l said about the studio.

1087
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,926
Good night, Mrs. Castle.

1088
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,803
<i>Lucky l didn't find Adam and Eve
in the swimming pool.</i>

1089
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:03,210
<i>-You're wrong, she's a little--
-l don't care what she is.</i>

1090
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:08,343
<i>l'm sorry, dear, but you're very wrong,
and l'll bet you $60 you're wrong.</i>

1091
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,508
Look.

1092
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:13,477
l was getting ready to go to bed,
and a certain matter came up--

1093
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,456
<i>Why my heart should be going
a mile a minute, l don't know.</i>

1094
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,426
Call a cab, will you?

1095
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,395
<i>All right, l'll call it myself.</i>

1096
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,437
<i>Can't you look at me and see the truth?</i>

1097
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,940
<i>l arrived a little too soon. That's the truth.</i>

1098
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:38,577
l had Hank drive me back from Brentwood
because l really thought you needed me.

1099
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,740
<i>l'm all kinds of a fool
to give you a second thought, aren't l?</i>

1100
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:42,976
Yeah, yeah.

1101
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,713
So what do you want from me? Bright dialogue?

1102
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,684
Something brilliant, witty?

1103
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,361
<i>What's your hurry?</i>

1104
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,561
<i>You can call a cab anytime.
You've got all night to call a cab!</i>

1105
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,903
<i>You're a great little one for dramatic exits.</i>

1106
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:06,104
<i>But l think this is the end of the line.
We've got to get it out on the table!</i>

1107
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,902
-Sit down.
-No, thank you.

1108
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:13,112
<i>lf you think l'm going to stay here
and listen to you, you're mistaken.</i>

1109
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,514
Let me talk.

1110
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:24,590
<i>Don't push me back into my usual position
of self-justification.</i>

1111
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,690
<i>For the time being,
we'll throw away a bunch of rotten grapes...</i>

1112
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,165
<i>...that's me, that you seem to feel is me...</i>

1113
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,101
...though l must say,
l think your judgment is lousy.

1114
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,696
You swat the fly on my nose with a hammer!

1115
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,472
We throw it away.

1116
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:44,273
<i>Yet every time we talk, it's about Charlie Castle!</i>

1117
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:45,538
Never once...

1118
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:50,414
...about his long-suffering, sickly wife, Marion.

1119
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,212
Do you know where your fatal error lies?

1120
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,724
<i>You ought to know, so l'm going to tell you.</i>

1121
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,219
<i>You're afflicted with a fine, fat case
of merchant psychology.</i>

1122
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,458
You bargain and trifle with your own nature.

1123
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:05,863
<i>That's your error.</i>

1124
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:09,699
<i>Tonight, you're about to possibly
destroy your life and certainly mine.</i>

1125
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,368
<i>Didn't we pick each other out of millions?</i>

1126
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,239
Can this be bargained away by saying,
like a merchant:

1127
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:20,306
<i>''Marion will be herself and love Charlie only if...</i>

1128
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:23,714
<i>''...he meets a certain price and conditions''?</i>

1129
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:31,153
<i>Where's the rich, full-hearted woman
l know you to be?</i>

1130
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,327
l say no more bargains, no more conditions...

1131
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:42,165
...no more of this either-or,
neither-nor whim that strangles us both.

1132
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:46,264
l say no, and l say
down with not being what we are.

1133
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,109
You can talk.

1134
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,812
<i>How you can talk when you're Charlie Castle.</i>

1135
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,575
<i>l'd like to beat you, beat you...</i>

1136
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,847
-Marion, l need you.
-...beat you!

1137
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,484
l love you.

1138
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:10,231
l promise you understanding, devotion...

1139
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,324
...anything l can give you.

1140
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:16,099
lf you leave me, cross your fingers as you go.

1141
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,672
ln fact, pray for me.

1142
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,968
<i>But if you stay, it's got to be real.</i>

1143
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,569
<i>You've got to stop reaching for that doorknob.</i>

1144
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,046
<i>You've got to love me that much more
than you do yourself.</i>

1145
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:58,570
Thank you.

1146
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,755
Do me a favor, will you?

1147
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,154
<i>Grow up before it's too late.</i>

1148
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,969
Just one more shot, Charlie.

1149
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,713
-Be with you in a minute, Hankus.
-All right.

1150
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,083
-Thanks, Charlie.
-Thank you, honey.

1151
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,551
<i>So you're leaving us all.
Going back to write the great American novel?</i>

1152
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,785
<i>Hollywood's loss, New York's gain.</i>

1153
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,793
Lucky guy. l kind of envy you, Hank.

1154
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,625
<i>Well, there's still time. The Chief's a big train.</i>

1155
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:52,290
Do you want me to make reservations for you?

1156
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:55,199
<i>-What's the book is going to be about?
-A man.</i>

1157
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:56,327
An average man.

1158
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,532
<i>-A man very much like you.
-Yes, that's very average.</i>

1159
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,443
Now, how could a man become
a popular movie star...

1160
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:05,445
...without reflecting the average
in one way or another?

1161
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,579
ls it really about a guy like me?

1162
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:13,717
<i>lt's a fable, about moral values.</i>

1163
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,352
Success, happiness.

1164
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:20,595
<i>You don't think Marion
is going to be happy here, do you?</i>

1165
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:24,492
<i>-No, l don't think she's going to be happy.
-Why not?</i>

1166
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,228
Because you were an idealist, Charlie,
and you sold out.

1167
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:32,568
You joined Hoff, Coy, and Company,
and that left you half an idealist.

1168
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,402
<i>There's nothing more tortured
on the face of this earth, neither fish nor fowl.</i>

1169
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:40,679
<i>A man who's sold out his dreams,
but he can't forget.</i>

1170
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,386
<i>Yes, but there are reasons, pal.
You don't have all the facts.</i>

1171
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:49,918
<i>An lrishman wrote, l think l sent it to you once,
The Quintessence of Ibsenism.</i>

1172
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:52,016
He said that there are three kinds of men.

1173
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,287
First, the realist.

1174
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,955
<i>Now, that's Coy.
He's made his deal with the devil.</i>

1175
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,861
<i>He wouldn't be any different.</i>

1176
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:02,694
<i>Then there's the philistine, like Hoff,
who couldn't be any different.</i>

1177
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,266
But they are what they are.

1178
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,136
<i>They have their own integrity.
They're incorruptible.</i>

1179
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,204
<i>Then there's the third kind, the idealist.</i>

1180
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,273
That was you.

1181
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:16,109
Half-idealism, Charlie,
is the peritonitis of the soul.

1182
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:23,624
Go write your book, Hank. Make it scandalous.

1183
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,584
Wire me for money anytime you need it.

1184
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:29,955
Somebody has to complete
the work he was born to do.

1185
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:36,660
<i>-Naive, ain't l?
-Yes, but it's one of your best qualities.</i>

1186
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:41,039
<i>''Peritonitis of the soul.''
Those are the words you use above ground.</i>

1187
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:45,912
Goodbye, Hank.

1188
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,846
Goodbye, Charlie.

1189
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,746
Struggle, you may still win a blessing.

1190
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,963
<i>Mr. Coy, he's been waiting for you.</i>

1191
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:09,970
<i>Hey, kitty, what's up?</i>

1192
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,596
<i>Where you been?
l've been looking everywhere for you.</i>

1193
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,842
<i>Oddly enough, l've been at the studio.</i>

1194
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:18,208
Some stills,
and l wanted to say goodbye to a writer friend.

1195
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,178
-Teagle?
-Yeah.

1196
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:24,078
<i>l thought he went back to New York.
l'm trying to remember his first name.</i>

1197
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,544
Horatio.

1198
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,354
-What did he ever write for us?
-Nothing that got on the screen.

1199
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,790
Stanley could never understand
what his scripts were about.

1200
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:38,925
<i>Charlie, something's come up, something hot.</i>

1201
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:42,731
<i>-l told Nat l wouldn't do that musical!
-lt's nothing to do with the musical.</i>

1202
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,999
Stanley blew his top with Dixie Evans.

1203
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,203
He asked her to come in this afternoon
and have a talk.

1204
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,076
She showed up one hour late, drunk,
lugging a dog on a leash.

1205
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,038
A poodle?

1206
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,042
The situation being serious enough,
Stanley kept his temper.

1207
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,479
He talked to her like a father.

1208
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:02,784
-He said--
-Let me tell you what he said.

1209
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,984
He told her about his bootblack days
in Bayonne.

1210
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:07,857
<i>Then he chimed softly
the ''uneasy lies the head'' routine...</i>

1211
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:11,831
...then, before you knew what was happening,
he was making with the tears.

1212
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,602
-Then what happened?
-She laughed in his face.

1213
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,532
Told him the whole town knew about his crying.

1214
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,471
lt was time to change the act.

1215
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:23,202
He hit her?

1216
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,978
Knocked her down, kicked her black and blue.

1217
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,449
May have broken one of her ribs.

1218
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:32,276
They taped her up in the infirmary.

1219
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:37,553
Our story is that the dog,
one of those great big monsters...

1220
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:40,492
...yanked on the leash and threw her to the floor.

1221
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:43,587
<i>She knows she can't make
an assault story stick, but...</i>

1222
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,495
<i>...she says she's ready
to spill your story to the press.</i>

1223
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:49,228
Particularly Patty Benedict.

1224
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,905
<i>-Where is she?
-That bar across from Schwab's.</i>

1225
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,983
A woman with six martinis can ruin a city.

1226
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,954
<i>-What are you smiling about?
-l'm not smiling.</i>

1227
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:20,834
<i>-What next on our sordid agenda?
-Somebody's got to saddle the horse.</i>

1228
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,562
<i>You've got to go there and get her out of that bar.</i>

1229
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,301
-Get her to where?
-Her apartment.

1230
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,969
<i>-Why me?
-You're the only one she'll go with.</i>

1231
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,803
<i>Now, don't worry about the telephone.</i>

1232
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:34,245
<i>We've taken care of that. lt's been yanked.</i>

1233
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,507
<i>Feed her some martinis. That'll keep her quiet.</i>

1234
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:43,813
<i>-Suppose they don't.
-They will. The gin's doctored.</i>

1235
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,704
<i>Okay, she's on the floor. Now what do l do?</i>

1236
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,866
<i>Leave the minute she passes out.
From that moment on, you're in the clear.</i>

1237
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,603
Report back to the studio.

1238
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,703
<i>You've been there all day long
making publicity stills.</i>

1239
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:11,652
Here.

1240
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:24,788
Your words have hair on them.
Your brain is full of lice.

1241
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:27,662
<i>Trust me, Charlie. There's no time to lose.</i>

1242
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,562
Just bear in mind one thing.

1243
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,231
The day you first scheme,
you marry that scheme...

1244
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,967
<i>...and the scheme's children.</i>

1245
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:39,671
<i>Everything you want this minute
depends on a few drinks in a trollop's guts.</i>

1246
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,709
What do you think she is? A moth, a bug?

1247
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:47,879
Speak easy. Keep flexible, kitty.

1248
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,325
<i>She'll go unremembered by the end of the week.</i>

1249
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,727
<i>-Where's Stanley?
-He doesn't know about this.</i>

1250
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:01,563
<i>Then we'll have to tell him, won't we?
You find him, Smiley. l'll get Marion.</i>

1251
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,637
<i>There's no reason for them to be involved.</i>

1252
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:07,299
<i>But there's plenty of reason for me
to be involved even deeper than before?</i>

1253
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,708
<i>l wouldn't do that, kitty.
And don't raise your voice again.</i>

1254
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:12,673
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

1255
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:15,909
<i>l'm the ''warrior minstrel with the forlorn hope.''</i>

1256
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,553
<i>-Sorry, l didn't mean to interrupt.
-lt's all right.</i>

1257
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,420
-Hello, Marion.
-Hello, Smiley.

1258
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:27,057
<i>l'll get my coat from the kitchen.</i>

1259
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:33,228
<i>-What's she doing here?
-Cheap serf labor. l pay her by the lifetime.</i>

1260
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,858
You were separated the other night.

1261
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:37,995
<i>l'm waiting. Take that library phone
and get that weeper here.</i>

1262
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:41,973
<i>Okay. lf l can't count on you,
l'll handle this myself.</i>

1263
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:45,271
<i>Murder is indivisible.
l'm finding that out, like chastity.</i>

1264
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,213
<i>There's no such thing as a small amount.
l'm finding that out.</i>

1265
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,874
<i>Don't blow your wig, scholar.</i>

1266
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,417
Get me Stanley Hoff!

1267
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,521
<i>-All right, l'll do it myself.
-Don't be boyish, Charlie.</i>

1268
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:58,214
You think you can involve Stanley
in a thing like this?

1269
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:02,422
<i>-He's already involved up to his neck.
-Prove it. Try and prove it.</i>

1270
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:06,795
<i>For your own sake, this is nobody else's
business, not even your wife's.</i>

1271
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,932
Smiley Coy wants to tell you something!

1272
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:14,771
<i>Kitty, l think you've really flipped.</i>

1273
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,336
<i>Marion, Charlie's drunk.</i>

1274
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,038
Go on, tell her, Smiley.

1275
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,014
Go ahead and tell her!

1276
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,881
<i>Now, don't be impetuous, kitty. Watch your step.</i>

1277
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:29,122
<i>Charlie's not sober enough
to discuss the script today.</i>

1278
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,191
l have certain facts in my hand.

1279
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,318
<i>lf they blow up,
l've got bleeding stumps left for hands.</i>

1280
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:35,859
<i>But you'll go, too.</i>

1281
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:38,963
This is Charlie Castle for Stanley Hoff.

1282
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,261
Charlie, what is it?

1283
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:41,892
Are you going to tell her?

1284
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,335
Marion, Charlie gets fanciful ideas
about his friend.

1285
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,033
<i>He's actually accusing me of plotting
the murder of a little studio bit player...</i>

1286
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:54,210
...who was with him in the car
the night of the accident.

1287
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,980
<i>l'll explain later, Marion.</i>

1288
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:02,613
Please, take the library phone
and get Nat here right away.

1289
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,195
<i>Maybe you know what you're doing.</i>

1290
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:11,228
<i>-l think l'll wait.
-l know you'll wait.</i>

1291
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:14,064
<i>You'll wait and wait and wait.</i>

1292
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:19,034
<i>-You mishandle your friends, kitty.
-You're not my friend.</i>

1293
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,869
That pathetic little girl is my friend.

1294
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:26,274
Lily? Uncle Hoff, please.

1295
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:33,916
<i>l know l'm not only expressing my views,
but yours as well.</i>

1296
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:38,283
As for your idea that Smiley Coy thought
in terms of violence and crime...

1297
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:42,124
<i>...with all due respect to what you thought,
l can't give it credence.</i>

1298
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,427
<i>You're saying Smiley didn't tell me anything.
l just dreamed it up.</i>

1299
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:49,469
<i>l wouldn't say you dream by day,
but after a few drinks, isn't it possible?</i>

1300
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,835
What is possible is exactly what l said.

1301
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:55,465
<i>-Let me round out my thoughts.
-Don't round them out.</i>

1302
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,408
<i>-l may continue--
-l don't want you to.</i>

1303
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:59,776
<i>You're never told,
the embroidery of your speech...</i>

1304
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,317
...is completely out of proportion
to anything you have to say.

1305
01:27:03,985 --> 01:27:05,043
All right.

1306
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:10,217
<i>l'm listening.</i>

1307
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,618
What do you have to say?

1308
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:18,356
He came here one hour ago.
He said there was trouble.

1309
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,560
-He then proposed that l--
-He proposed nothing of the sort!

1310
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:25,572
To say a man like Smiley Coy,
a former major in the US Army Air Force...

1311
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:27,937
<i>...a friend of many,
l don't know where to begin...</i>

1312
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,977
<i>...the late Al Jolson,
Jerome Kern, Bill O'Dwyer....</i>

1313
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:34,105
To say that this man plotted murder
is to stagger reason.

1314
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:36,813
<i>You're wasting valuable time.</i>

1315
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:39,479
<i>Stanley, you're 1,000 percent right.</i>

1316
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,522
Pneumonia is at the door,
and we are talking about a headache.

1317
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,353
What would you do in my place?

1318
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,791
We have to convince this girl not to talk.

1319
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:50,523
<i>l agree with you, but you can't ask me
to go into battle with my hands tied.</i>

1320
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,395
<i>l've always been a simple man.</i>

1321
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,493
And l still make my breakfast on a roll,
butter and a cup of coffee.

1322
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,168
<i>Can't you stop talking about yourself?</i>

1323
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:06,203
Why does the woman have to be here?

1324
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,039
The lady stays.

1325
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:15,252
Stanley, l want to go to this girl myself
and talk to her like a father.

1326
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,950
<i>See if we can't work out
some feasible cash offer...</i>

1327
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:19,492
...out of my own pocket.

1328
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,789
<i>-We could split the difference.
-lt's too late.</i>

1329
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:25,297
This girl is without the fundamentals
of an education and understanding.

1330
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,337
What is the percentage for a few dollars
to cut off our nose and bite our face?

1331
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:32,633
When l say no, l mean no.

1332
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,140
<i>There are a few people in town
who've found this out.</i>

1333
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:37,643
-But the girl must--
-All right, thank you very much.

1334
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:38,939
Wait a minute.

1335
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,650
What did Smiley whisper
into that phony tin trumpet?

1336
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:45,984
You tell them, Smiley.

1337
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,620
<i>That she's still at the bar
being entertained by a friend of mine.</i>

1338
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:53,854
<i>-lf anything happens to her--
-You're selling fish four days old, kitty.</i>

1339
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:57,225
<i>She's with Monty Ritz. ls he a conspirator, too?</i>

1340
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,094
Why not?

1341
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:01,191
For all l know,
you could have a blackmail on Monty, too.

1342
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,997
<i>We're talking about murder.</i>

1343
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,907
Your client has to learn how to talk.

1344
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:10,938
We know who the expert is
when it comes to murder.

1345
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:13,377
A boy like you? Who are you?

1346
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:17,107
Who are you? Some kind of special aristocracy...

1347
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:20,449
...because the female public
wants to make love with you?

1348
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:24,514
Who are you,
with your dirty, unmanicured fingernails...

1349
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:28,853
...and what are you without
Hoff-Federated behind you?

1350
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:33,962
l built the studio! l, with my brain and my hand!

1351
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:37,401
l ripped it out of the world
with my brains and my hands!

1352
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:38,767
And who are you?

1353
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,465
No, this must stop!

1354
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,836
Why do l have to listen to this miserable boy?

1355
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:46,072
<i>A man like myself, who's wined and dined
with presidents and kings?</i>

1356
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,775
-My aching back!
-Do l have to cater to this?

1357
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:53,251
<i>Well, l've had enough
of your phony senatorial eloquence.</i>

1358
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,489
<i>l'll chop you down like firewood.</i>

1359
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,150
lt is a bit of miserable pity
that l have to talk to you.

1360
01:29:58,259 --> 01:29:59,726
<i>That's it. That's the deal.</i>

1361
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,260
Charlie, l beg of you, please!

1362
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:03,489
We never have to talk to each other again.

1363
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,089
<i>Nat, you're my agent.
From now on, it's you and him.</i>

1364
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,592
l never have to talk to him again.

1365
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,661
<i>-You'll drive me too far.
-Will l?</i>

1366
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,274
<i>What's your boiling point, Uncle Hoff?</i>

1367
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:17,967
<i>Well, don't sulk, don't act bored,
and please don't cry.</i>

1368
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,873
Charlie, l beg of you, please.

1369
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:23,473
<i>l'm deliberately tampering
with your modest ego, Stanley...</i>

1370
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:26,382
...because today l see
what Stanley Shriner Hoff would do...

1371
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,546
...to protect an investment. Murder.

1372
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,851
This man buries himself with his mouth.

1373
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,957
Look at him. Get his act.

1374
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,358
<i>He's trying to play the crocodile.</i>

1375
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:39,524
And what is he? A little lizard under a rock.

1376
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:42,159
Get together with the legal department
in the morning...

1377
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,636
...check the Castle contract
and find me an opening.

1378
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,434
You find me a pen.

1379
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:50,167
<i>l think there's one other solution.</i>

1380
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:53,710
Yes, here it comes, the gimmick,
the twist, the old switcheroo.

1381
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:56,749
<i>There's always a twist, sweetie.
They always work in pairs.</i>

1382
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:59,376
<i>There's an angle to this Dixie problem.</i>

1383
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,283
Marion, it depends upon you.

1384
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:02,689
What?

1385
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:06,517
You and Charlie have been separated
three times in the last two years.

1386
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:09,589
Do you love him enough to make a sacrifice?

1387
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,722
-Do l love him?
-Let him finish, dear.

1388
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:16,398
<i>Dixie would marry Charlie in a minute.
lt's the fulfillment of all her dreams.</i>

1389
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,038
Community property laws
will automatically take care of you.

1390
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,371
Half of everything Charlie owns belongs to you.

1391
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,809
<i>Gentlemen, l can't believe my ears!</i>

1392
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:29,178
<i>Let him finish before you jump in
where it doesn't concern you, Nat.</i>

1393
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:34,349
This woman has been having to do with a writer
we had on the lot recently.

1394
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:35,649
<i>That isn't true.</i>

1395
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:37,883
From time to time, they had relations.

1396
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,458
<i>That just isn't true!</i>

1397
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,152
Let me handle this.

1398
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,892
Of course, you have proof.

1399
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:46,255
Records.

1400
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:50,964
<i>You have records of conversations l've had
with Mr. Teagle in his office?</i>

1401
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,307
And tape recordings in his office
and on his couch.

1402
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,479
Who ordered such recordings to be made?

1403
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:01,614
<i>l couldn't say. That's out of my hands.</i>

1404
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:03,946
-Where are they?
-ln my car.

1405
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:07,621
Get them.

1406
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,051
Get them, Smiley.

1407
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:14,652
Get them.

1408
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:24,261
<i>''Live and let live'' has always been
an important motto with me, Marion.</i>

1409
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:29,507
l have nothing against you personally,
you understand.

1410
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:33,541
<i>But sometimes, for the good of the company,
l'm forced to play a little rough.</i>

1411
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,445
Nat, a little sparkling water.

1412
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,556
All right. All right.

1413
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:49,358
<i>My career is finished, and l'm willing...</i>

1414
01:32:49,764 --> 01:32:54,667
<i>...namely because you're the meanest,
dirtiest skunk God ever put breath into.</i>

1415
01:32:56,470 --> 01:33:00,531
This is Mr. Hoff,
a man that l fall down on my knees...

1416
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:04,168
<i>...and thank my maker that l don't
have to play ball with him anymore.</i>

1417
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:10,280
<i>Excuse me, Charlie, dear, that l'm crying.</i>

1418
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:16,288
<i>Don't worry, Marion.</i>

1419
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,386
<i>Don't worry, Charlie.</i>

1420
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:22,292
<i>Before l'll get you in trouble,
l'll put my own head on the railroad tracks.</i>

1421
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:36,276
<i>There's nothing to defend about those records.</i>

1422
01:33:58,065 --> 01:33:59,396
<i>lt's late.</i>

1423
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,928
<i>Don't you boys ever go home to dinner?</i>

1424
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:05,231
Do that.

1425
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:08,235
Do that for me, Smiley. Take Hoff home.

1426
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:10,143
Get him out of here.

1427
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:23,948
<i>You're so lucky.</i>

1428
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:27,752
<i>lf this were a movie,
you'd have been on the floor 10 times.</i>

1429
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,569
Just a small token.

1430
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:40,735
<i>l'll break you.</i>

1431
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:43,642
<i>l'll break you like a--</i>

1432
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,117
No.

1433
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:55,120
<i>No, no, l'll let the law do it for me.</i>

1434
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,921
<i>l'll let the law do it for me this time,
and you lose everything.</i>

1435
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:04,120
You lose everything.
This is a scandal and a disaster and a ruin.

1436
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:07,031
<i>The dead child's family
and the insurance company...</i>

1437
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:10,228
...will take everything off your back
in any court in the land.

1438
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:13,568
The clothes off your back,
off your child, and off that woman.

1439
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:15,374
Everything goes, Charlie.

1440
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:20,773
Everything goes, the house goes,
the paintings go, and you!

1441
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,606
You go!

1442
01:35:24,852 --> 01:35:26,149
Oh, no, Charlie.

1443
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,558
You threw away a kingdom today.

1444
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:40,324
Well?

1445
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:43,627
Go on.

1446
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:44,966
Goodbye, kitty.

1447
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:47,834
<i>l'll leave you to the wolves and the knives.</i>

1448
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:51,205
You no longer have me and the studio
to handle the press for you.

1449
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:53,107
<i>You're through.</i>

1450
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:55,645
What l said still goes.
lf anything happens to her--

1451
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,218
The studio has no further interest in that girl.

1452
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:12,889
All quiet.

1453
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:14,862
l need a tonic.

1454
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:20,739
There are things beyond money to that man...

1455
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,603
...but this much money....

1456
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:25,269
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

1457
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:29,210
<i>He talks with his mouth,
but he'll protect his investment.</i>

1458
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:32,147
And in the meanwhile...

1459
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:34,778
<i>...l'll tell you what Uncle Nat will do.</i>

1460
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:37,480
<i>l'll take Miss Dixie Evans home with me...</i>

1461
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:41,152
<i>...and out of my own pocket,
l'll offer her a $10,000 bill.</i>

1462
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:44,354
<i>No, Nat. lt's too late.
lt's too late from my point of view.</i>

1463
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:49,159
<i>l can't go on covering one crime with another.</i>

1464
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,334
<i>That's Macbeth.</i>

1465
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:56,839
Charlie, dear,
please, stop wringing your mental hands.

1466
01:36:56,944 --> 01:36:59,469
<i>Macbeth is an allegory, Nat.</i>

1467
01:37:00,114 --> 01:37:01,638
One by one, he...

1468
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,179
...killed his better selves.

1469
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:08,545
My back is stiff.

1470
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:10,390
Go home, Nat.

1471
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:12,183
<i>l'll go over later and talk to Dixie.</i>

1472
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:15,126
The worst that happens,
she passes out, Monty puts her to bed.

1473
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:16,753
<i>He's done it before.</i>

1474
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:18,225
<i>l'll call you later.</i>

1475
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:19,993
-You promise?
-Yes, around 8:00.

1476
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,897
<i>Now, don't worry. l'll call you.</i>

1477
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:23,333
Goodbye, dear.

1478
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,499
Goodbye, darlings.

1479
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:30,133
<i>-You'll call?
-Yes.</i>

1480
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:37,776
<i>-You're sure?
-Yes, l'm sure.</i>

1481
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:53,757
Why did l add this burden to that...

1482
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,735
...grotesque, devoted soul?

1483
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:02,767
Did you ever notice
he moves his lips when he reads?

1484
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:06,105
<i>Darling, here's Nicky.</i>

1485
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,746
Well, what do you say?
Can l get you something?

1486
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:11,746
Marion? Charlie?

1487
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,649
Yeah, Nicko.

1488
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,925
Go run a bath for me.

1489
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:24,086
Good and hot. My back is stiff.

1490
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:26,324
<i>Don't worry, l'll take care of that.</i>

1491
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:33,905
<i>-That thing between you and Hank....
-No, darling, l didn't.</i>

1492
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:36,374
<i>Now, don't explain. l believe you.</i>

1493
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,007
Look how sweaty....

1494
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,848
My hands....

1495
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:49,185
Come here, angel.

1496
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,314
Sit here.

1497
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,490
Well?

1498
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:03,737
What do you think of today?

1499
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:06,566
Think l can list all the possible roads ahead?

1500
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:10,667
<i>Don't bother. We won't silence that girl.
lt's become the cause of her life.</i>

1501
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:16,316
You see, everyone needs a cause
to touch greatness.

1502
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:20,543
<i>Hank doesn't leave until tomorrow.</i>

1503
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:25,015
-Did you ever tell him about all this?
-No.

1504
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:31,156
<i>Why don't we call him over?
Hank knows how to fix.</i>

1505
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:35,159
All right.

1506
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,279
Hello, Hank?

1507
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:57,782
Look, dear,
would you come over here right away?

1508
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:00,390
Yes, we need your advice about something.

1509
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,455
<i>Yes, it's very important.</i>

1510
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:06,591
<i>''The times beyond are cold and lonely.</i>

1511
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:10,333
<i>''Far away as the stars.''</i>

1512
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:15,565
Once, there were two of us.

1513
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:22,677
<i>Billy mustn't grow up to be a rich man's son.</i>

1514
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:27,543
<i>-He won't.
-They're usually made of sponge cake.</i>

1515
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,152
<i>But he won't be.</i>

1516
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:38,588
<i>You've taught me so many things, darling,
even how to listen to music.</i>

1517
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:44,060
-Play some music.
-All right.

1518
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:49,068
-What would you like to hear?
-Something immortal.

1519
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:52,670
<i>l don't know, anything that's on the machine.</i>

1520
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,215
<i>I can never leave him, Hank.</i>

1521
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:05,450
<i>It's not just that I'm a wife
of the old-fashioned school.</i>

1522
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:07,887
<i>I'm so deeply a part of his existence.</i>

1523
01:41:08,962 --> 01:41:11,897
<i>No matter how many times I leave,
I always go back.</i>

1524
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:14,357
<i>He's part of me.</i>

1525
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:18,864
<i>The most terrible things he can do to me
are better than not having him.</i>

1526
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,151
<i>lt wasn't what l expected to hear.</i>

1527
01:41:56,510 --> 01:42:00,606
-ls it getting dark in here?
-Yes, darling, it is.

1528
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:02,940
<i>l'll turn on the lights.</i>

1529
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:10,512
Hello, Buddy.

1530
01:42:12,926 --> 01:42:14,655
Hiya, Buddy.

1531
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:20,458
<i>What's the matter, kid?</i>

1532
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:22,629
You were my friend.

1533
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:27,906
l knew what she was.

1534
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:30,507
Tore the heart out of me every time it happened.

1535
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:32,044
You were my friend.

1536
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:34,938
How could you do it?

1537
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,744
You want to hit me?

1538
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,788
Please, hit me.

1539
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,295
<i>l know you're a better man than l am.</i>

1540
01:42:49,396 --> 01:42:52,763
l mean, such a swell guy you were, Charles.

1541
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,428
l always looked up to you.

1542
01:42:57,304 --> 01:43:00,831
But when she told me, she laughed in my face.

1543
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:07,012
<i>That's how l resign.</i>

1544
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,308
C.U.F. Castle.

1545
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:40,045
He murdered Cass. l was there.

1546
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:41,407
l saw him do it.

1547
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,115
<i>Charlie, the bathtub's almost full.</i>

1548
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:48,711
<i>l run out of big towels upstairs,
so l'll get some from the cabana.</i>

1549
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:59,988
Did you ever know that all my life...

1550
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:03,228
<i>...l've yearned for people
to bring out the best in me.</i>

1551
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:06,439
Marion.

1552
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,013
All that embittered you....

1553
01:44:19,353 --> 01:44:21,446
l pledge you a better future.

1554
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:52,381
Have l told you today how much l love you?

1555
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,712
l love you.

1556
01:44:55,889 --> 01:44:57,823
<i>And l'm committed to you.</i>

1557
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,922
<i>We won't talk about the past.</i>

1558
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:19,605
Telephone for you, Mrs. Castle.

1559
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:22,580
<i>-lt's Billy, he's calling from the Stevens'.
-Thank you.</i>

1560
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:24,878
<i>There'll be four of us. Make a light supper.</i>

1561
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,543
Light supper for four, right.

1562
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:29,747
<i>And no parsley on anything.
Mr. Castle doesn't like it.</i>

1563
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,823
Right.

1564
01:45:35,128 --> 01:45:36,356
Hello, darling.

1565
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:37,823
How are you?

1566
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,695
Poor cowboys, what a shame.

1567
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,239
<i>Why don't you hit him back?</i>

1568
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:50,836
No, wait a minute, Billy, l was wrong.

1569
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:52,777
<i>Don't hit him back.</i>

1570
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:57,875
<i>Explain to him that,
since he's bigger than you, it isn't fair.</i>

1571
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:04,346
<i>Sure, l'll pick you up after lunch tomorrow.
Now, don't forget to brush your teeth.</i>

1572
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,282
Good night, darling.

1573
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:09,252
l just let myself in.

1574
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:12,728
<i>l'm sorry about what happened here
this afternoon. Deeply sorry.</i>

1575
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:14,026
May l use your phone?

1576
01:46:14,134 --> 01:46:17,001
<i>Don't go,
you'll be interested in what l've got to say.</i>

1577
01:46:17,738 --> 01:46:21,731
Mr. Hoff is a very vain man.
We have to cater to that sometimes.

1578
01:46:22,509 --> 01:46:25,342
<i>Lily, put me through to the old man.
lt's important.</i>

1579
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:26,671
<i>Where's Charlie?</i>

1580
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:28,771
Taking a bath. What do you want?

1581
01:46:29,015 --> 01:46:30,539
You misunderstand, Marion.

1582
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:33,813
<i>l'm nothing more
than a sort of memo pad for Mr. Hoff.</i>

1583
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:35,076
Stanley.

1584
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:37,481
The girl left the bar 10 minutes ago.

1585
01:46:37,657 --> 01:46:39,989
Tried to navigate across Sunset Boulevard.

1586
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:43,427
Yeah, in all that heavy, home-going traffic.

1587
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,031
<i>That's the picture.</i>

1588
01:46:48,001 --> 01:46:49,127
Killed instantly.

1589
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:53,236
How do you like that for the luck of the lrish?

1590
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,365
<i>l'm here using Charlie's phone now.</i>

1591
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:58,643
<i>Okay, l'll be right back in. Bye.</i>

1592
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:02,247
-Marion, before you say anything--
-What a happy coincidence.

1593
01:47:02,449 --> 01:47:04,314
lt was a city bus that hit her.

1594
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:08,150
<i>-Changes everything, doesn't it?
-Does it?</i>

1595
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,418
<i>Not that Stanley's forgotten
what happened here this afternoon.</i>

1596
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:14,619
Some sort of an apology
should be arranged, carefully, of course.

1597
01:47:14,828 --> 01:47:16,591
Yours is just the level head to do it.

1598
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:18,891
<i>Don't you have a memory
from one hour to the next?</i>

1599
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,466
<i>Don't go dramatic on me.</i>

1600
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:24,196
<i>Seven years is a long time.
We've got a long row to hoe.</i>

1601
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:25,965
How does someone like you live?

1602
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:29,369
<i>This afternoon, you try to ruin a man
who's 10 times your better...</i>

1603
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:31,137
...and when you were finished...

1604
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:35,078
...you toted out of here in the footsteps
of a thing not even fit to breath.

1605
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:37,548
Charlie, something must be wrong
with that valve.

1606
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:40,313
<i>What's going on?
Water's leaking down to the kitchen.</i>

1607
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,581
Charlie, l think you let the tub run over.

1608
01:47:47,494 --> 01:47:49,155
<i>There's water all over the hall!</i>

1609
01:47:49,262 --> 01:47:51,787
Tell him to try to break the bathroom door down!

1610
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:53,656
Charlie, open the door!

1611
01:48:11,451 --> 01:48:12,577
Get the water off!

1612
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:20,453
<i>What's happened?</i>

1613
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:25,127
l never in my life saw anything so wrong.

1614
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:28,224
<i>-What happened with Charlie?
-l can't tell you what happened.</i>

1615
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:31,896
<i>-Please, Mrs. Castle. Please!
-Don't hold me, Russell. Let me go!</i>

1616
01:48:32,005 --> 01:48:33,700
<i>l'm sorry, but you can't come in.</i>

1617
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:35,604
Put me through to Eddie Fry.

1618
01:48:35,775 --> 01:48:37,834
Break through. This is Smiley Coy.

1619
01:48:38,044 --> 01:48:39,477
Pull the plug, stupid!

1620
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,207
<i>Now, listen carefully,
l don't want to repeat a word.</i>

1621
01:48:45,318 --> 01:48:46,285
Listen!

1622
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:49,153
Get Dr. Curley, get Stanley...

1623
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:51,816
<i>...send them here
to Charlie Castle's house right away.</i>

1624
01:48:51,925 --> 01:48:54,655
<i>You get here, and do your work for me.
Here's your work.</i>

1625
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:56,626
Take this down word for word.

1626
01:48:57,297 --> 01:49:01,791
<i>''Charlie Castle, renowned star
of 30 Hoff-Federated Pictures...</i>

Stanley Shriner Hoff.''</i>

1633

and the rest of the wire services.

<i>Don't ask questions!</i>

1635

Bring 12 studio cops when you come.
This place will be a madhouse in a minute.

1636
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:40,039
What?

1637
01:49:41,141 --> 01:49:44,235
Tell Stanley he slashed himself in three places.

1638
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:03,953
Hey, Nick, snap out of it.

1639
01:50:04,898 --> 01:50:08,356
<i>Go on, clean up. Change your clothes.
There'll be a nice piece of change.</i>

<i>Punchy, l'm talking to you.</i>

1641

Come on, snap out of it.

1642
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:21,542
You killed him...

1643
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,680
...the whole bunch of you.

1644
01:50:26,886 --> 01:50:28,854
You found him.

1645
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:32,154
Killed him.

1646
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:35,754
Go away.

1647

1649

-That's why it's necessary.</i>

1652
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:36,254
This is no time to get contentious, kitty.

1653
01:51:36,356 --> 01:51:38,324
Your work is finished here.

1654

There will be no photographers,

<i>l'll tell the story.</i>

1656
01:51:46,766 --> 01:51:48,131
He killed himself...

1657
01:51:50,136 --> 01:51:54,300
...out of the pain and anguished love
he had for others, he gave up his salvation.

1658
01:51:56,476 --> 01:52:00,913
But no man had a greater reverence for life,
a greater zest for living.

1659
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:04,173
Yes, he was wrong.

1660
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:08,579
<i>But he just couldn't go on
hurting those he loved.</i>

1661
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:06,505
Charlie.

1662
01:53:15,054 --> 01:53:16,146
Help.

1663
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:36,241
Help! Help! Help!
