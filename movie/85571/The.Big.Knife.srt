00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,756
“这是贝莱尔。
'This is bel air.

2
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,468
这是权贵们奢华的居所。
'The lush, luxurious retreat of the wealthy and powerful.

3
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:41,143
“如果你在电影行业工作并取得成功，”这个精心照料的好莱坞郊区可能是你安家的地方。
'If you work in the motion picture industry and are successful, 'this well-tended suburb of Hollywood is where you will probably make your home.

4

“这里不允许失败。
'Failure is not permitted here.

5
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,649
我们的故事与20世纪的一种现象有关。

6
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,901

问题:生存。

00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:01,622
查理·卡塞尔出卖了自己的梦想，但他无法忘记
'Charlie castle is a man who sold out his dreams, 'but he can't forget them.'

10
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,014
太好了,不是吗?一个人什么。
Great, isn't he? What a guy.

11
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,474
告诉他我来了。
Tell him I'm here.

12
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,852
好的，帕蒂，马上就来。我知道他见到你会很高兴的。
Sure, Patty, right away. I know he'll be glad to see you.

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,187
是的…
Yeah...

14
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,986
查尔斯?
Charles?

15
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,404
持有它。
Hold it.

16
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,158
-怎么了，伙计?-帕蒂·本尼迪克特来了。
- What's up, buddy? - Patty Benedict's here.

17
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,830
什么，她刚进来了吗?
What, did she just walk in?

18
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,667
有人告诉我她要来这里，我就跑过去了。
I was told she was going to drop by here, I raced right over.

19
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,127
——帕蒂本笃。——啊呀!
- Patty Benedict. - Aargh!

20
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,173
-你把我绑在里面，是吗?-你来得太快了，亲爱的。
- You had me tied up in there, didn't you? - You came in too fast, sweetheart.

21
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,342
帕蒂想要什么，查理?
What's Patty want, Charlie?

22
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,678
哦,马里昂,分离。
Oh, Marion, separation.

23
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,222
它是如何传播的?你跟她说了什么?
How does it get around? What did you tell her?

24
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,892
什么都没有。如果我这么做了，她现在就不会在这里了。
Nothing. If I had, she wouldn't be here now.

25
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,436
我在工作室工作。我必须让你远离麻烦。
I work for the studio. I have to keep you out of trouble.

26
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,854
好。
Good.

27
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,649
快把我弄出去。
So get me out of this.

28
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,235
-和她合作，嗯?——玩球吗?
- Play ball with her, huh? - Play ball?

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,404
我想和她一起打球。
I'd like to play ball with her head.

30
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,030
放轻松，好吗?
Take it easy, will you?

31
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,616
和她聊一聊。她有1800万读者。
Schmooze her a little. She's got 18 million readers.

32
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,994
我会在五分钟内让她离开这里。
I'll have her out of here in five minutes flat.

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,664
放松,老兄。停止忧虑。
Relax, buddy. Stop worrying.

34
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,500
我已经处理过上百次了。
I've handled this a hundred times.

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,795
一个人什么。你刚才吓了我一跳。
What a guy. You had me scared there for a minute.

36
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:40,095
帕蒂,亲爱的。亲爱的，你好吗?
Patty, darling. How are you, sweetie?

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,889
-点燃我的香烟，恰克。——确定。
- Light my cigarette, Chuck. - Sure.

38
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,059
你昨晚怎么了?我环顾四周，你已经走了。
What happened to you last night? I looked around and you'd gone.

39
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:52,816
我问过迈克了，但是…腼腆的斯迈利想让我见一个人，一些外地来的脱衣舞女。
I asked Mike, but... Smiley coy had somebody he wanted me to meet, some of those strip-shirts from out of town.

40
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,777
谁想从柠檬水摊上买什么?
Who wants what from the lemonade stand?

41
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,487
-好友?-不用了，谢谢。
- Buddy? - No, no, thanks.

42
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,656
我喜欢这个房间的通风。
I like the airiness of this room.

43
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,744
-哦，法国画，亲爱的?-是的。
- Oh, French paintings, dear one? - Yeah.

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,912
你不再买美国货了吗?
Don't you buy American anymore?

45
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,040
别灰心，亲爱的，我不认识任何一个画家。
Let nothing you dismay, sweetie, I don't know one painter from another.

46
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,959
他分不清画家和画家。
He doesn't know one painter from another.

47
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,378
我可不想让我的粉丝认为我在搞艺术。
I wouldn't want my fans to think I'd gone arty.

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,132
-那是马里昂的爱好。-是的，那是他妻子的爱好。
- They're Marion's hobby. - Yeah, they're his wife's hobby.

49
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,176
我认识你多久了，恰克?
How long do I know you, Chuck?

50
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,553
哦，胖了9年，10年。
Oh, a fat nine, ten years.

51
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:26,641
我们第一次见面时，你谈的都是新协议，公平协议之类的。
When we first met, all you could talk about was the new deal or the fair deal or some deal.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,271
我相信你现在相信什么?
Ibehevedinit what do you believe in now?

53
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:37,235
健康，努力工作，生的烤牛肉和好的剧本。
Health, hard work, rare roast beef and good scripts.

54
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,738
你比以前聪明多了。
You're a lot smarter child than you used to be.

55
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,281
我必须学习，帕特丽夏。
I had to learn, Patricia.

56
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,159
查理的口号是:“收到消息，通知西部联合电报公司。”
Charlie's slogan: "Got a message, send for western union."

57
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,746
-我听说你的新电影不错。-它会分红的。
- I hear your new picture's good. - It'll pay a dividend.

58
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,499
-那你的新合同呢?-怎么了，伙计?
- What about your new contract? - What about it, buddy?

59
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:55,337
电影公司得到了所有的合同…斯坦利·霍夫上周告诉我，你打算续签。
The studio got the contracts all... Stanley hoff told me last week, you were about to re-sign.

60
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,799
他是工作室的负责人。梦想不需要他付出任何代价。
He's the head of the studio. It doesn't cost him a thing to dream.

61
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,552
-你和斯坦利有仇吗?-我怎么能和霍夫叔叔不和?
- Are you and Stanley having a feud? - How could I feud with uncle hoff?

62
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,806
-霍夫先生就像查理的父亲。——为什么,当然。
- Mr. Hoff's been like a father to Charlie. - Why, sure.

63
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,516
恰克，我要去地铁了。
Chuck, I'm off to Metro.

64
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,311
但在我走之前，我想知道分手传闻的真相。
But before I go, I want the truth about the separation rumors.

65
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,193
她总是想给我贴上标签。谣言只是谣言。
She's always trying to tag me. The rumors are just that, rumors.

66
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,945
——没有基础。-但究竟为什么…?
- No basis. - But why in the world...?

67
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,823
玛丽安带比利去了海滩，因为他感冒了。
Marion took Billy to the beach because he's got a cold.

68
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:28,328
如果别人在我之前刊登了你的离婚故事我是不会原谅你的。
I don't think I'd ever forgive you if someone else printed your divorce story before I did.

69
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,665
我希望你能理解。
I hope you understand that.

70
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,251
他知道。
He understands that.

71
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,336
我做了什么?
Do I?

72
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,757
-查理的意思是…-闭嘴五分钟。
- What Charlie means by that is... - Shut up for five minutes.

73
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,760
我要听他的闲话，而不是他的尾巴。
I want my gossip from the horse's mouth, not his tail.

74
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,096
得了吧，帕蒂，这是他的生活。
Come on, Patty, it's his living.

75
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,640
你不可能成为民主党人吗?
Is it impossible for you to be Democratic?

76
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,850
查理!
Charlie!

77
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,231
给自己倒杯喝的，伙计。
Fix yourself a drink, buddy.

78
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,238
听着，我不想你僵硬，冷静一下。
Look, I don't want you to get stiff, take a chill.

79
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,659
-你好吗，本尼迪克特小姐?-很好，谢谢你，尼克。
- How are you, miss Benedict? - Fine, thank you, Nick.

80
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,038
嗯,那很好。我都准备好给你按摩了。
Well, that's nice. I've got everything ready for your rub.

81
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,957
谢谢,性格。
Thanks, character.

82
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,959
有一件事我一直不明白。
One thing I've never understood.

83
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:20,463
在那件丑闻之后，为什么制片厂要把布利斯的工作还给他?
Why did the studio give bliss back his job after that scandalous mess?

84
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,969
巴迪·布利斯是个一流的公关。他也是一位亲密的私人朋友。
Buddy bliss is a first-rate publicity man. He's also a close personal friend.

85
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,178
我知道。
I know.

86
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,223
你是他的品德证人你付了他所有的律师费。
You were a character witness for him and you paid all his legal fees.

87
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,643
亲爱的，我不明白你的意思。巴迪被判入狱10个月。
I don't get your point, sweetie. Buddy went to jail for 10 months.

88
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,896
再说，这都是过去的事了。
Besides, it's all past and forgotten.

89
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,565
如果我选择复活它，它不会被遗忘。
It's not forgotten if I choose to revive it.

90
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,609
你为什么要这么做?
Now, why would you want to do that?

91
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,904
你们有些人忘记了这个城市必须保持干净。
Some of you forget that this town has got to keep its skirts clean.

92
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:51,828
在摄影棚的圣诞派对上，这个白痴偷了你的车…-他借了我的车。-他半醉半醒地开车…他没有喝醉，亲爱的。这在法庭上被澄清了。
At the studio Christmas party, this idiot steals your car... - He borrowed my car. - He drives along half-drunk... He wasn't drunk, sweetie. That was cleared in court.

93
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,830
事实是，他撞了人就跑了。
The fact remains, he hit and ran.

94
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:59,836
当这里的大佬把车丢在你的草坪上警察在平安夜走的时候你感觉有多友好?
How friendly did you feel when big brains here ditched the car on your lawn and the police walked in Christmas Eve?

95
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,463
-他所做的一切…——现在,帕蒂。
- All he did... - Now, Patty.

96
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:06,384
他所做的一切，你亲爱的朋友，几乎毁了我的职业生涯。
All he did, your dear friend, was to almost ruin a career right out of the storybooks.

97
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,137
我以为我们能像个正常人一样原谅他。
I thought we could be human enough to forgive that.

98
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,848
难道他没有及时站出来承担责任吗?
Didn't he step up in time and take the blame?

99
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,812
我还是觉得让他重回工作岗位是非常糟糕的公共关系。
Well, I still think it was very poor public relations giving him his job back that way.

100
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:26,655
帕蒂……在这个疯狂、混乱的世界里，有那么多的头条新闻，你为什么还想打开那个老旧的豌豆罐头?
Patty... with all the headlines in this crazy, mixed-up world, why would you want to open up that tired old can of peas?

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,826
我来交换。
I'll make a swap.

102
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,080
你的婚姻呢?
What about your marriage?

103
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,838
这就是你的答案吗?
Is this your answer?

104
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,261
你刚刚做了一件非常愚蠢的事，恰克。
You've just done a very foolish thing, Chuck.

105
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,394
谢谢你的来访。要健康强壮。上帝保佑。
Thanks for the visit. Be well and strong. God bless.

106
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,239
你好。我打扰到什么重要的事情了吗?
Hello. Am I interrupting anything important?

107
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,957
-你好，卡塞尔夫人。-你好，本尼迪克特小姐。
- Hello, Mrs. Castle. - Hello, miss Benedict.

108
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,960
嗨,蜂蜜。
Hi, honey.

109
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,632
我不知道你在房子里。
I didn't know you were in the house.

110
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,759
我只是来镇上购物的。
I just came into town to shop.

111
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,971
——你好,马里昂。——嗨,老兄。
- Hello, Marion. - Hi, buddy.

112
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,059
你知道世界上有与生俱来的力量，伙计，需要宣传。
You know there's innate power in the world, bud, needs publicity.

113
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,478
就像洗衣店对待床单和枕套一样。
What laundries do to sheets and pillowcases.

114
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,481
-我每个月都买一打。-你为什么不试试梅公司?
- Every month I buy a dozen. - Why don't you try the may company?

115
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,485
他们以非常适中的价格出售高档细布床单。
They sell a fine percale sheet at a really modest price.

116
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,614
卡塞尔夫人，告诉我，你和查理还睡双人床吗?
Tell me, Mrs. Castle, do you and Charlie still use a double bed?

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,993
或者这是个愚蠢的问题，因为你们现在已经分居了?
Or is that a foolish question, since you're separated now?

118
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,537
你们分居了，是吗?
You are separated, aren't you?

119
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,623
帕蒂，你真是太有毅力了。
Patty, you sure take the cake for persistence.

120
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,210
我们都是理智、老练的人。穿绉布也没用。
We're all sensible, sophisticated people. There's no use wearing crepe.

121
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,548
去年这个国家有40多万起离婚案件。
There were over 400,000 divorce cases in this country last year.

122
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,051
它就像普通的感冒一样普遍。
It's getting as common as the ordinary head cold.

123
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,428
也许你是对的，本尼迪克特小姐。
You know, you may be right, miss Benedict.

124
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,263
然而，我觉得这很悲哀。
However, I find it sad.

125
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,725
我们的私人生活与你无关。
And our personal life is not your affair.

126
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,398
-你是那个会告诉我的孩子。-马里恩…我才是这个镇子里敢于告诉你少管闲事的人。
- And you're the child who'll tell me. - Marion... I'm the one in this town who's not afraid to tell you to mind your own business.

127
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,277
好吧，我很高兴我们达成了谅解。
All right, I'm glad we've come to an understanding.

128
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,904
——现在,帕蒂……-别大惊小怪，恰克。
- Now, Patty... - No fuss, Chuck.

129
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,531
我知道我什么时候不受欢迎了。我知道这一点。
I know when I've worn out my welcome. I'm aware of that.

130
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,991
皮特的缘故!
For Pete's sake!

131
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,578
埃斯，你最好做点什么，否则我们都要完蛋了。
Ace, you'd better do something, or we'll all end up the creek.

132
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,291
听着，小天使你以为你在干什么?
Look, angel what do you think you're doing?

133
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,169
她不会在我家里跟我耍花招的。
She doesn't play madam pry with me, not in my own house.

134
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,507
帕蒂,等等!
Patty, wait!

135
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,720
我是做电影的。我不能承受你对正直的猛烈攻击。
I'm in the movie business. I can't afford your acute attacks of integrity.

136
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,056
你跟她说话的方式!
Oh, the way you talk to her!

137
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,850
——这是怎么回事?——液体蜂蜜。
- How's that? - Liquid honey.

138
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:05,188
-哦，我对她不真诚。-丈夫，对我虚情假意吧。
- Oh, I'm insincere with her. - Husband, be insincere with me.

139
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,731
帕蒂有1800万读者。
Patty's got 18 million readers.

140
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,691
为什么她对抗?意义在哪里?
Why antagonize her? Where's the sense?

141
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,486
有时候，我相信完全没有知觉。
From time to time, I believe in being completely senseless.

142
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,530
我是个女人，不是外交官。
I'm a woman, not a diplomat.

143
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,491
你对她说"上帝保佑"的方式!
The way you said "god bless" to that one!

144
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,952
我还以为你会想吐呢。
I should think it'd make you want to throw up.

145
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,079
当然，你并不真诚。
Of course, you're not sincere.

146
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,500
你过得怎么样?
How have you been?

147
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,086
很好。很好。
Fine. Just fine.

148
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,007
我开始喜欢这张照片了。
You know, I'm beginning to like this picture.

149
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,885
可以进入奥运代表队。
Could make the olympic team.

150
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,725
关于这个rouault，你说得对。他那么做。
You're right about this rouault guy. He broods.

151
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:50,024
有一定的品质。我不知道…这几天我看了很多次。
There's a certain quality. I don't know... I've been looking at it a lot the last few days.

152
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,153
有时候，当我最近一个人的时候…
Sometimes, when I'm alone lately...

153
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,742
一个老小丑在等待，等待继续。
An old clown waiting in the wings, waiting to go on.

154
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,245
跳几下，让他们大吃一惊。
Cut a few capers, knock 'em dead.

155
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,541
但他已经做过无数次了。
But he's done it a million times.

156
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,336
它已经没有任何意义了。
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

157
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,721
-极强的?——没有。
- Too fortissimo? - No.

158
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,769
我会把它买回来。
I'd buy it all back.

159
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:35,195
比利怎么样?我已经两周没见到他了。
How's Billy? I haven't seen him for two weeks.

160
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,823
——三个星期。-好吧，三周。
- Three weeks. - Okay, three weeks.

161
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,575
他感冒了。
He has a cold.

162
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,204
——发烧?——嗯。
- Fever? - Uh-uh.

163
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,791
但是，你知道，它一直在。你就是不能让他远离大海。
But, you know, it hangs on. You just can't keep him out of the ocean.

164
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,049
-在海滩上寂寞吗?——是的。
- Is it lonely at the beach? - Yes.

165
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,597
——非常孤独?-查理，别开始了。
- Very lonely? - Charlie, don't start this, please.

166
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,557
回来吧，天使，我可以改变。
Come back, angel, I can change.

167
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,310
你如何改变?你这样太久了。
How can you change? You've been this way for so long.

168
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,312
我能。你一定要相信我。
I can. You've got to believe me on this.

169
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,065
在此之前，我相信过你很多次。
I have believed you before this, any number of times.

170
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,027
-你不会认为那些偶尔出现的女孩…-是的，我确实认为那些偶遇的女孩!
- You don't think those occasional girls... - Yes, I do think those occasional girls!

171
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,570
惊讶吗?
Surprised?

172
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,489
查理!
Charlie!

173
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,201
男人的生活只有两种方式，要么结婚，要么像单身汉一样。
A man can live only one of two ways, either married or like a bachelor.

174
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,872
你想要的是两者中最好的!在我看来，那不是婚姻。
What you want is the best of both! And that's not a marriage, not in my book.

175
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:36,005
查理·卡斯……他是个奇迹。
Charlie cass... He was a wonder.

176
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,675
我是凯斯太太。
I was Mrs. Cass.

177
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,303
现在你是霍夫的卡塞尔先生了。
Now you're hoff's Mr. Castle.

178
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,307
哦,来吧!我不信。我不属于斯坦利·霍夫!
Oh, come on! I don't buy that. I don't belong to Stanley hoff!

179
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,892
——不是吗?——不!我是自由球员!
- No? - No! I'm a free agent!

180
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,978
你打算和他签新合同吗?
Are you going to sign his new contract?

181
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,897
玛丽恩，我想让你回到我身边。
Marion, I want you to come back home to me.

182
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,691
-就这样?——是的。
- Just like that? - Yes.

183
00:12:54,816 --> 00:13:00,613
我还不够完美，但如果你以为自己能独自面对这个广阔的世界，那你就错了。
I'm far from perfect, but you're making a mistake if you think you can face this big, wide world alone.

184
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,368
别告诉我你有比利，因为他还是四口就能吃下一颗葡萄。
Don't tell me you've got Billy, because he still eats a grape in four bites.

185
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,078
没有我，你就没有家。
Without me, you don't have a family.

186
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,498
你连个朋友都没有，除非是汉克·缇格。
You don't even have a friend, unless it's Hank teagle.

187
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,209
汉克早在成为你的朋友之前就是我的朋友。
Hank was my friend long before he was yours.

188
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,714
汉克昨晚向我求婚了。
Hank asked me to marry him last night.

189
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,173
然后呢?
And?

190
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,969
你说什么?
What did you say?

191
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,679
我能说什么呢?
What could I say?

192
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,558
他有勇气。
He's got his nerve.

193
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,728
-他只说了"如果"——如果?
- All he said was "if". - If?

194
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,146
如果,如果,如果!
If, if, if!

195
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,648
我不想跟你谈这个，不是吗?
I tried to avoid this conversation, didn't I?

196
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,152
好吧,你赢了。名人丈夫说:“你赢了。”
Okay, you win. Famous husband remarks, "you win."

197
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,322
拜托，别像个家庭主妇。
Please, don't be such a housewife.

198
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,867
别碰那讨厌的眼镜!我们花钱请人来做这件事!
Leave the lousy glasses alone! We pay somebody to do that!

199
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,243
罗素!
Russell!

200
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:04,135
看……我手表的烂表带也断了。
Look... The lousy strap's broken on my watch, too.

201
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,227
我需要周一的支票。
I'll be needing a check for Monday.

202
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,313
账单堆积如山。
The bills are piling up.

203
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,193
好吧，我会让哈罗德从办公室寄过来的。
All right, I'll have Harold send it from the office.

204
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,542
为什么,Castle太太。我没听见你进来。
Why, Mrs. Castle. I didn't hear you come in.

205
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,045
-很高兴见到你。-谢谢你，拉塞尔。
- This is a real pleasure. - Thank you, Russell.

206
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,339
一切顺利吗?
Everything running all right?

207
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,717
像丝绸一样光滑，卡塞尔夫人。很好。
Smooth as silk, Mrs. Castle. Just fine.

208
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,803
这很好。我走之前再见你。
That's good. I'll see you before I leave.

209
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,137
谢谢你！
Thank you.

210
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,308
-你能把这个拿出来吗?——是的,女士。
- Oh, would you mind taking this out? - Yes, ma'am.

211
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,816
查理?
Charlie?

212
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,488
你要不要和霍夫重修旧好?
Are you renewing with hoff or not?

213
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,824
汉克哪来的胆量向你求婚?
Where does Hank get the nerve to propose to you?

214
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,119
忘记汉克。他两周后要去纽约。
Forget about Hank. He's leaving for New York in two weeks.

215
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,162
去找40美分的杜松子酒?
To find a 40-cent gin?

216
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,582
他正在写一部新小说。他戒酒好几周了。
He's writing a new novel. He's been on the wagon for weeks.

217
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,253
听着，你说你想让我回到你身边。
Look, you say you want me to come back to you.

218
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,756
相信我，我不会，永远不会，只要你签了那份合同。
Well, believe me, I won't, not ever, if you sign that contract.

219
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,133
哦,那了!
Oh, that again!

220
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:30,221
我从没想过有一天一笔敲定的交易会让你不寒而栗!
I never expected to see the day when a firm deal would give you chills and fever!

221
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,141
我也不知道，我和下一个一样也是人。
Neither did I. I'm as human as the next one.

222
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,395
这是一笔极好的交易，但有效期是七年，以及随之而来的生活。
It's a fabulous deal, but it's for seven years, and the life that goes with it.

223
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,148
或者我该说随之而来的死亡?
Or should I say the death that goes with it?

224
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:44,193
看看你自己。你现在已经半死了。
Look at yourself. You're half-dead right now.

225
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,320
我好多年没见你这么神采飞扬了。
I haven't seen you sparkle in years.

226
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,532
你在别人面前装模作样，但我是你妻子，我知道。
You put on a show for other people, but I'm your wife, I know it.

227
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:57,415
查理,我的查理…你的思想，你的精神，你的灵魂都怎么了?
Charlie, my Charlie... What's happened to your mind, your spirit, your soul?

228
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,834
查理·卡斯，我嫁的那个人。
Charlie cass, the guy I married.

229
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,378
他是一只老虎。他喜欢争论。
He was a tiger. He liked to argue.

230
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:07,133
因为你有信仰，你为之奋斗。
Because you believed in things, and what you believed in, you fought for.

231
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,177
这是查理·卡斯。
And that was Charlie cass.

232
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,805
你现在相信什么?
What do you believe in now?

233
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:22,899
你想要什么?就像那个在沃尔格林药店喝着咖啡，对着剧院的悲惨状况大吼大叫的孩子吗?
What do you want? The wild-eyed kid I was, nursing a cup of coffee in walgreens, yelling about the sad state of the theatre?

234
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,735
我告诉你我不想要什么。
I'll tell you what I don't want.

235
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,158
我可不想让一个愚蠢的，满座的家伙坐在杜松子酒桌旁，交换电话号码和最新消息!
I don't want one of those witless, sold-out guys sitting around a gin table, swapping phone numbers and the latest dirt!

236
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,659
哦，你说得真好。
Oh, how you talk.

237
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,954
查理，我不想你签那份合同。
Charlie, I don't want you to sign that contract.

238
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,956
你给了制片厂一磅肉。
You've given the studio their pound of flesh.

239
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,919
我是霍夫联邦最大的明星。我每年对他们来说值几百万。
I'm hoff-federated's biggest star. I'm worth millions a year to them.

240
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,714
-他不让我走。你知道为什么。-告诉他你要离开好莱坞。
- He won't let me go. You know why. - Tell him you're leaving Hollywood.

241
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,841
保证不给别人拍电影。
Promise never to make pictures for anyone else.

242
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,093
很好。我该怎么办?电视、玩吗?
Fine. What do I do? TV, a play?

243
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:55,223
剧院是一个流血的残垣。你得等好几年才能得到一个像样的角色。
The theatre's a bleeding stump. You gotta wait years for one decent part.

244
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,684
不管怎样，这是什么鬼话?
And anyhow, what is all this arty bunk?

245
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,147
你知道这个行业有能力拍出好电影，有勇气和意义的电影。
You know this industry is capable of turning out good pictures, pictures with guts and meaning.

246
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,526
当然，当然，我们认识一些这样做的人。
Sure, sure, and we know some of the men who do it.

247
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:15,576
斯蒂文斯，曼凯维奇，喀山，休斯顿，威勒，怀尔德，斯坦利·克莱默，但没有斯坦利·霍夫!
Stevens, mankiewicz, kazan, huston, wyler, Wilder, Stanley Kramer, but never Stanley hoff!

248
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,871
从来没有!不是一次!不管他的命怎么样!
Never! Not once! Not for the life of him!

249
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,499
不是为了那些浮夸的媒体声明!
Not for all the pompous press statements!

250
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,878
斯坦利·霍夫将亲自制作托尔斯泰的《战争与和平》!
Stanley hoff will personally produce 'war and peace' by Tolstoy!

251
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,213
要有那么一天就好了。
That'll be the day.

252
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:34,637
主演查理·卡塞尔一手拿着长鞭……和…另一个是漂白过的金发女郎。
Starring Charlie castle with a bullwhip in one hand... And... a bleached blonde in the other.

253
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,267
哦……查理。
Oh... Charlie.

254
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,186
请过来一下。
Come here, please.

255
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,776
亲爱的，这个世界上永远都有斯坦利·霍夫。
Darling, there'll always be Stanley hoffs in this world.

256
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,946
不只是在电影行业，而是在所有地方。
Not just in the movie industry, but everywhere.

257
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:59,829
他总是一个蔑视体面和人类尊严的人，想把你也拖下水。
Always one who, just by his contempt for decency and human dignity, tries to drag you down with them.

258
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,373
查理,不。
Charlie, no.

259
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:08,045
我是霍夫的囚犯和天使，签署这份合同就是赎金。
I'm hoff's prisoner and angel, and signing this contract is the ransom fee.

260
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,715
那天晚上我没有勇气。
I didn't have the nerve that night.

261
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,386
-我做了错误的决定。-那晚我们做了错误的决定。
- I made the wrong decision. - We made the wrong decision that night.

262
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,390
-我应该朝另一边走。-亲爱的，我们都失败了。
- I should've swung the other way. - Darling, we both failed.

263
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,894
我应该从自怜中挣脱出来，推你一把。
I should've snapped out of my self-pity and shoved you.

264
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,691
但我们还有第二次机会。我知道这是一场赌博。
But we have a second chance. It's a gamble, I know.

265
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,193
我知道如果你拒绝签字霍夫会怎么做。
I know what hoff can do if you refuse to sign.

266
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,364
-你以为你知道。-查理，他只是个普通人。
- You think you know. - Charlie, he's only a man.

267
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,618
他不是神，他不会在愤怒中杀死我们。
He's not god, to strike us down in his wrath.

268
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,461
你真想把它扔掉吗?
You really want to throw this away?

269
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:55,468
我知道我说的是你辉煌的事业以及随之而来的一切，但是拒绝他，查理，拒绝他。
I know I'm talking about your fabulous career and all that goes with it, but refuse him, Charlie, turn him down.

270
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,053
好吧……
Alright...

271
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,681
”| | |试一试。
|'|| try.

272
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:06,062
我还没同意签字呢。我已经拖延了几周，几个月。
I haven't actually agreed to sign. I've been stalling for weeks, for months.

273
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,149
nat要过来了。也许他能想出一个好主意。
And nat's coming by. Maybe he can come up with a big idea.

274
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,611
我很喜欢nat，他很善良。
I'm very fond of nat, he's good and kind.

275
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,322
但这次你只能靠自己了。
But you'll have to fight this one by yourself.

276
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,158
-可能行不通。-就看你的了。
- It may not work. - It's in your hands.

277
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:33,589
我们的爱。我的意思是……我们彼此相爱，不是吗?这是关键，重要的一点。
We do love. I mean... We do love each other, don't we? That's the thing, the big thing.

278
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,383
我需要你。
I need you.

279
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,594
我要你把斯坦利·霍夫撕成碎片，老虎。
I want you to tear Stanley hoff apart, tiger.

280
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,059
——嗨,尼克。——你好,马里昂。
- Hi, Nicky. - Hello, Marion.

281
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,020
噢,呃…希望我没有打扰到重要的事情。
Oh, er... I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.

282
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,939
是的，但没关系。
You are, but it's all right.

283
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,441
查理……该给他按摩了，马里昂。
Charlie... It's time for his rub, Marion.

284
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,443
-哦，那可以等。-不，不行。
- Oh, that can wait. - No, it can't.

285
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,278
他马上就出来，尼基。
He'll be right out, Nicky.

286
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,532
老虎，我要你身体健康，身体健康。
Tiger, I want you in condition, in the pink.

287
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,452
我有一大堆事情要做，晚饭前还要搬家。
I have a million things to do, and a household to move by suppertime.

288
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,287
——家庭?——确定。
- Household? - Sure.

289
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,125
我，比利，还有这一切。我们是你的，不是吗?
Me, Billy, the whole shebang. We're yours, aren't we?

290
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,597
我稍后再打给你。
I'll call you later.

291
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,100
再见。
See you later.

292
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,978
再见,老虎。
Goodbye, tiger.

293
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,354
再见。
Good bye.

294
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,570
第八大道，雅各布海滩。
Eighth Avenue, Jacob's beach.

295
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,532
你和我，去圣尼克。
You and me, going to St. Nick's.

296
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,950
是的,当然。
Yeah, sure.

297
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,077
你的经纪人来了。
Oh, there's your agent.

298
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,247
嘿,nat !你在那干什么，nat，老家伙?
Hey, nat! What are you doing there, nat, old kid?

299
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,751
,先生们!-你说呢?
- Gentlemen! - What do you say, huh?

300
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,923
——查理。-不，我很油腻，你会弄脏的。
- Charlie. - No, I'm greasy, you'll get all dirty.

301
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:02,136
娜特，等我做完了，我来锻炼一下你的肩膀怎么样?
Say, nat, when I'm through, how about me working that shoulder of yours?

302
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,931
尼基，你很贴心，但医生说要做透热和打针。
Nicky, you're a sweetheart, but the doctor says diathermy and shots.

303
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,058
没有摩擦。
No friction.

304
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,561
啊,滑囊炎。
Ah, bursitis.

305
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,856
这一行的流行趋势是什么?溃疡。
What's the fashion in the industry? Ulcers.

306
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,734
愤怒。我得了滑囊炎。
The rage. I get bursitis.

307
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,447
但谢谢你，尼基，你想帮忙真是个绅士。
But thank you, Nicky, you are a true gentleman for wanting to help.

308
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,575
口渴时喝水。
Water when you're thirsty.

309
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,706
别跑题了，我今天早上见过你们的业务经理。
Not to digress, I saw your business manager this morning.

310
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,041
哈罗德?
Harold?

311
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,127
他说你是个坏孩子。他没有批准的检查。
He says you're being a bad boy. Checks he didn't approve.

312
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,256
我该怎么做，问艾森豪威尔我能不能塞给一个饥饿的骑手200块?
What am I supposed to do, ask eisenhower if I can slip a hungry rider $200?

313
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,217
这不是我的问题。
That's the least of my problems.

314
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,595
问题。生活充满了问题。他们的工作。
Problems. Life is all problems. They work out.

315
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,766
我有个宝贝要给你，小娜。玛丽恩坚决反对合同。
Well, I've got a honey for you, nat. Marion's dead set against the contract.

316
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,351
我要去找她。
Her, I'm going to talk to.

317
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,229
你不用告诉那个老头。
You don't have to tell the old man.

318
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:58,442
你们俩真是甜蜜的凡人。我知道她有点忙乱。
You two are such sweet mortals. I know she's a little hectic.

319
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,863
我不想签。我怕如果我这么做，会失去我的家庭。
I don't want to sign it. I'm afraid if I do, it'll cost me my family.

320
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,115
听着，玛丽安会冷静下来的，查理。
Look, Marion will cool down, Charlie.

321
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,994
-我会和她谈谈，你签…-我说的话你一句也没听见，对吧?
- I'll talk to her and you'll sign the... - You don't hear one thing I say, do you?

322
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,538
——没有!——亲爱的,听着。
- Nothing! - Darling, listen.

323
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,624
听?我为什么要听?你从来不听我的!
Listen? Why should I listen? You never listen to me!

324
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,880
现在我在听。
I'm listening now.

325
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
我不想签合同!
I don't want to sign the contract!

326
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,010
——你不?-不，我不喜欢。
- You don't? - No, I don't.

327
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,307
-我以为你已经同意签了。-倾听不代表同意。
- I thought you agreed to sign it. - Listening doesn't mean agreement.

328
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,853
我听斯坦利的话，我听你的话，我听得脸色发青。
I listen to Stanley, I listen to you, I listen till I'm blue in the face.

329
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,438
但我不同意签那份合同。
But I did not agree to sign that contract.

330
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,653
我不能再拍那些恶心的电影了。
I can't keep doing those lousy pictures.

331
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,824
但合同上白纸黑字写的。你不必这么做。
But it's in the contract, black on white. You don't have to.

332
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,953
在你看到剧本之前，我就批准并确保剧本是好的。
I approve and make sure the scripts are good, before you even see them.

333
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:55,541
我是久经沙场的查理·卡塞尔。
This is Charlie "been-around- a-long-time" castle you're talking to.

334
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,210
现在，来吧，给我想个办法。
Now, come on, give, think me a way out.

335
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:12,141
亲爱的，首先我得告诉你，斯坦利今早让我去他办公室谈合同谈了两个小时，跟哥伦比亚打了招呼，结果就是他们要来这里。
Well, darling, first I ought to tell you Stanley had me in his office about the contract this morning for two hours, hail Columbia, which all leads to the fact that they're dropping in here.

336
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,605
——在这里吗?- Stanley hoff和smiley coy。
- Here? - Stanley hoff and smiley coy.

337
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,608
——什么时候?-随时都可能。
- When? - Any minute now.

338
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:25,446
邀请你去看比赛，但这将是一场摊牌。
To invite you to the races, but it's going to be a showdown.

339
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,448
尼克,酒精。
Nick, the alcohol.

340
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,326
小娜，你得把我弄出去。
Nat, you've got to get me out of this.

341
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:34,079
亲爱的，我非常担心。
Darling, I'm terribly worried.

342
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,833
大家都以为你很坚强。
Everybody has got the delusion that you're very tough.

343
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,210
他们把你和你扮演的角色搞混了。
They mix you up with the parts you play.

344
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,047
但我更了解你。
But I know you better.

345
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,841
你是一个特别的理想主义者。
You're a special, idealistic type.

346
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,511
唯一的问题是，商业和理想主义，不能混为一谈。
The only thing is, business and idealism, they don't mix.

347
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,263
这是油和水。
It's oil and water.

348
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,934
电影对你来说不是电影，而是福音。
A movie is not a movie to you, it's a gospel.

349
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:00,773
但是你错了，亲爱的先生和朋友，总的来说……Nat,闭嘴!请闭嘴!
But you're mistaken, dear sir and friend, in all... Nat, shut up! Please, shut up!

350
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,525
尼基，去房子那边。到那房子里去!
Nicky, go up to the house. Go up to the house!

351
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,908
希腊人能做点什么吗?
Is there anything a Greek can do?

352
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,206
去房子那边，尼基。他们到了就通知我。
Go up to the house, Nicky. Let me know when they get here.

353
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,877
谢谢,性格。
Thanks, character.

354
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,845
查理，说几句重要的话。
Charlie, a few important words.

355
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:39,353
我们现在不是在和斯坦利讨价还价，但我愿意做任何你让我做的事，在我的能力范围内，因为仁慈的上帝坐在上面。
We are not in a bargaining position with Stanley, but I'd do anything you ask me, within my power, as the good lord sits above.

356
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,438
把我弄出去，小娜。
Just get me out of here, nat.

357
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,649
斯坦利不让你走。
Stanley wouldn't let you go.

358
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:48,070
如果我撕毁合同，我们搬走呢?
Suppose I just tore up the contract, and we moved away?

359
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,531
-他会怎么做?——是的。他会怎么做呢?
- What would he do? - Yes. What would he do?

360
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,160
上帝禁止他做任何事。
God forbid what he would do.

361
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,956
查理，永远不要因为你不喜欢一个男人而低估他。
Charlie, never underestimate a man because you don't like him.

362
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:03,335
在斯坦利每天修指甲之前我就认识他了。
I know Stanley since before he had his fingers manicured every day.

363
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,921
他会怎么做。
What he would do.

364
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,717
我们别无选择，查理。
We've got no choice, Charlie.

365
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,887
你知道他有什么把柄。我们不谈的那件事?
You know what he's got on you. That thing we don't talk about?

366
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,519
亲爱的……签字，否则就进监狱。
Darling... You sign, or you go to jail.

367
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,900
他们在这里!霍夫先生和笑脸忸怩!
They're here! Mr. Hoff and smiley coy!

368
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,287
任何方法都是一种死亡方式，对吧?
Every way is a way to die, huh?

369
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,832
我老了。每一种方式都是一种生活方式。
I'm older. Every way is a way to live.

370
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,627
我希望你是对的，娜特。
I hope you're right, nat.

371
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,300
绝对没有。你知道的，霍夫先生。
Absolutely nothing. You know how it is, Mr. Hoff.

372
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,303
有些拳手很厉害，能听到声音，但我不是。
Some fighters, they get punchy, they hear things, but not me.

373
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,972
Nang-nang-nang !见到你,尼克。
Nang-nang-nang! See you, Nick.

374
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,017
啊哈!
A-ha!

375
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,063
两个头在一顶帽子下。这里发生了什么?
Two heads under one hat. What goes on here?

376
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,191
你好吗，斯坦利?笑脸吗?
How are you, Stanley? Smiley?

377
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,611
小娜老是烦我，我都不和他打招呼了。
Nat's in my hair so frequently, I don't say hello to him.

378
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,529
没想到会在这找到你，小娜。
I didn't expect to find you here, nat.

379
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,365
我只是在上帝的阳光下进来，仅此而已。
I just came in out of god's sunshine, that's all.

380
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,078
-你今天早上是怎么醒来的，凯蒂?-我没醒，我醒过来了。
- How'd you wake up this morning, kitty? - I didn't wake up, I came to.

381
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,372
洗了十五分钟冷水澡，我才想起自己的名字。
Fifteen minutes under a cold shower before I could remember my name.

382
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,417
-你听说乔·阿克曼的事了吗?——没有。什么?
- Did you hear about Joe Ackerman? - No. What?

383
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,752
癌症。
Cancer.

384
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:31,507
哦，可怜的乔，可怜的玛莎。我昨天才看到他们。
Oh, poor Joe, poor Martha. I saw them only yesterday.

385
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,383
我今晚得给那里打个电话。
I'll have to call there tonight.

386
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,677
那件长袍真漂亮。你从哪儿弄来的?
That's a wonderful robe. Where'd you get it?

387
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:38,138
我想是尼克·卡罗吧。
Oh, Nick carroll's, I think.

388
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,434
这是一种快乐，感觉紧挨着你的皮肤。
That's a pleasure to feel next to your skin.

389
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,020
-斯迈利，你给我找几个。——会做。
- Smiley, you find me a few of those. - Will do.

390
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:50,651
查尔斯，请您赏光参加今天下午的赛马。
Charles, we request the pleasure of your company at the races this afternoon.

391
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,613
我觉得我去不了了，斯坦利。
I don't think I can make it, Stanley.

392
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,199
工会规定允许的话，我可以当调酒师了。
I'm ready to bartend, union regulations permitting.

393
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,659
斯坦利?
Stanley?

394
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,161
给我来点苏打水，笑眯眯的。
I'll have a little sparkling water, please, smiley.

395
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,955
别当老古董了，查理。
Don't be an old fossil, Charlie.

396
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,391
你将享受这个下午，我们将感谢你的陪伴。
You'd enjoy the afternoon, and we'd appreciate your company.

397
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:15,050
我很想，我真的很想，斯坦利，但事实是，一些外地的朋友，马里昂的朋友…你知道查理的为人，总是无私奉献。
I'd like to, I really would, Stanley, but the fact is, some friends from out of town, friends of Marion... You know how Charlie is, always giving of himself.

398
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,387
玛丽恩，她是个好女孩。
Marion, she's a wonderful girl.

399
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:23,517
我希望你们能和她和好，就像你们是我的家人一样。
I hope for your reconciliation with her as if you both were my own family.

400
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,102
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

401
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:35,154
如果我们能表达神圣的意志，而幸福的婚姻肯定就是这样一种表达，那么我们就真正开始超越我们自己的自私目标了。
If we can express the divine will, and a happy marriage is certainly such an expression, then we are really beginning to live beyond our own selfish aims.

402
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,905
你真好，斯坦利。
That's very sweet of you, Stanley.

403
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,909
既然我们在这里进行友好的秘密会谈，那合同呢?
Since we're here on a friendly conclave, how about the contract?

404
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,373
-快点，它在长胡子。-嗯，我遇到麻烦了。
- Come on, now, it's growing whiskers. - Well, I'm having trouble with it.

405
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,627
麻烦吗?什么样的麻烦?你告诉我，我有宽阔的肩膀。
Trouble? What sort of trouble? You tell me, I've got broad shoulders.

406
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,797
查理，人们可以对我直言不讳。
Charlie, people can speak frankly to me.

407
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:58,844
你所处的位置使你有资格提出最高的要求，所以，请告诉我你内心深处的想法。
You're in a position which entitles you to make the highest demands, so, please, tell me your innermost thoughts.

408
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,555
我不想签合同。
I don't want to sign the contract.

409
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,226
-你和玛丽安谈过了吗?——是的。
- Have you talked this over with Marion? - Yes.

410
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,740
你们还是夫妻啊。树和树皮。
Well, you're still man and wife. Tree and bark.

411
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,784
这是上帝安排的，我能理解。
God's put that together, I can understand that.

412
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,747
马里昂想在合同里看到什么?
What does Marion want to see in the contract?

413
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,333
嗯,这……这是'tjust马里昂。
Well, it... it isn'tjust Marion.

414
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,377
我们商量过了。
We talked it over.

415
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,715
我不想再签了。
I don't want to sign again.

416
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,761
-斯坦利，查理觉得…——不,不。你让他回答。
- Stanley, Charlie feels... - No, no. You let him answer.

417
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,723
——为什么?-这就是全部，斯坦利
- Why? - Well, it's the whole thing, Stanley.

418
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:49,228
签这么长时间的合同。
The whole idea of signing for that length of time.

419
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:54,775
斯坦利，人们总是可以对你坦诚相待，而这正是查理想要做的。
Stanley, people can always speak frankly with you, and that's exactly what Charlie wants to do.

420
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,739
查理……你建议怎么做呢?
Charlie... What do you propose to do instead?

421
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,492
我想离开好莱坞。
Well, I want to leave Hollywood.

422
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:08,288
我可以签任何东西保证我再也不拍电影了。
I'll sign anything guaranteeing you I'll never make pictures again.

423
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:16,255
我对你和霍夫联邦政府没什么意见。只是……我累了。我想离开。
I've got nothing against you or hoff-federated. It's just that... I'm tired. I want to go away.

424
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,300
当然,当然。我明白了。
Sure, sure. I understand.

425
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:28,225
这样吧，你被解雇了。六个月，甚至一年。
I'll tell you what, you go on a layoff. Six months, a year even.

426
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,519
不，我想永远离开。
No, I want to go for good.

427
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,109
啊哦……
Uh-oh...

428
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,737
我明白了。
I see.

429
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:46,868
查理·卡塞尔，我很容易想起我们多年前的第一次见面。
Charlie castle, I easily recall to mind our first meeting many, many years ago.

430
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,954
你还记得我当时说的话吗?
You remember what I said at that time?

431
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,123
是的，有些东西。
Yes, some of the things.

432
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:56,712
请原谅我闭着眼睛说话但这样能让我看得更清楚。
Please, you'll excuse me for speaking with my eyes closed but it helps me see better.

433
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:03,719
“我看到了一个稚嫩的青年，充满了天赋的特殊活力。”
"I see a raw youth filled with that special vitality of talent."

434
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,723
我说，如果我没记错的话
I says, if memory serves:

435
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:12,519
“查理·卡斯，你会成为这个行业里最大的明星之一。
"Charlie cass, you're going to be one of the biggest stars in this business.

436
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:17,816
"当然有小绿苹果"你会遇到很多很多问题。
"Sure as there are little green apples, "you're going to run into many, many problems.

437
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,694
“这就是我来这儿的原因，”我说。
"That's what I'm here for," I says.

438
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,115
“我的建议是免费的，我乐意提供。
"My advice is free, given with pleasure.

439
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:32,539
"我也许不是总能帮上忙，"但很可能不止如此"
"I may not always be able to help, "but probably more than not."

440
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:46,219
Charlie castle……你不止一次来看我。
Charlie castle... You came to see me more than once.

441
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,140
——真的吗?-是的，真的，真的。
- True? - Yes, true, true.

442
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,228
斯坦利，查理一直很尊重你的判断力。
Stanley, Charlie has always had great respect for your judgment.

443
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,314
奉承,甚至。
Adulation, even.

444
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,360
我跳过了我们之间多年的亲密关系。
I'm skipping the years of coolness between us.

445
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:05,280
你再也不来我办公室了。为什么，我永远不会明白。
You came to my office no more. The reason why, I never will understand.

446
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:13,705
但无论如何，我总是在你和你的家人身边，在白天的炎热和辛劳中，我总是在你和你的家人身边，在白天的炎热和辛劳中，我总是在你和你的家人身边。
But nevertheless, I was there for you and yours, and the vexing problems that are so manifold in the heat and toil of the day.

447
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,418
然后，在某个晚上，就在这间屋子里，法律意味着丑闻。
Then, on a certain night, in this very room, the law spelled scandal.

448
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,296
那时我也在你身边。
I was there for you then, too.

449
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,966
查理，我想给你讲个小故事。
Charlie, I want to tell you a little story.

450
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:29,012
查尔斯，我想给你讲个小故事!这可能与你有关!
Charles, I'd like to tell you a little story! It may concern you!

451
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:42,609
多年来，我妻子的那个女人…我明白了一些事实。那是合并的一年。
For a number of years, the woman that was my wife... Certain facts came home to me. That was the year of the merger.

452
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,028
就像我说的，这些事实出现了。
These facts came up, as I said.

453
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,155
我的妻子……
My wife...

454
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,700
喝酒……
Drinking...

455
00:31:52,744 --> 00:32:00,836
特定的场景……纽约的某间酒店房间…自杀未遂。
Certain scenes... A certain hotel room in New York City... Attempted suicides.

456
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,257
我当时疯了。但那次我们把她带回来了。
I was out of my mind. But we brought her back that time.

457
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,469
斯迈利是我前一年雇佣的好员工。
Smiley was good enough to enter my employ the year before.

458
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,681
这一切都归结为一个事实!
It all added up to one fact!

459
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:16,810
精神分析!精神分析!
Psychoanalysis! Psychoanalysis!

460
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:22,023
3万或4万美元在一年内就白白浪费掉了，但我们并不吝啬。
$30,000 or $40,000 down the drain in one year, but not begrudged.

461
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,318
我想逗她开心。
I thought to amuse her.

462
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,531
我给她买了艘游艇，阿尔伯塔号。
I bought her a pleasure boat, the alberta.

463
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,616
也以她的名字命名。
Named after her, too.

464
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,621
没有什么帮助。什么都没有。
Nothing helped. Nothing.

465
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:50,218
然后有一天，frank lubner在我的办公室，他是这个行业的先驱，微笑着忸怩…我喝了一杯加苏打水的淡味苏格兰威士忌，然后哭了起来。
Then one day in my office, frank lubner was there, a pioneer in the industry, smiley coy... I drank a light scotch and soda, and I began to cry.

466
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,889
我从小就没这么哭过了。
And I haven't cried like that since I was a boy.

467
00:32:54,014 --> 00:33:05,817
因为我从痛苦中看到，我的妻子在内心深处决意要摧毁我和我的事业，出于故意的、恶意的嫉妒。
Because I saw, through a revelation of pain, that my wife was determined in her innermost mind to destroy me and my career out of willful, malicious jealousy.

468
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,195
你问我为什么。我问你为什么。
You ask me why. I ask you why.

469
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,700
但从那天起，我意识到生活中一个重要的事实!
But from that day on, I realized one essential fact of life!

470
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:18,997
当丈夫为女人挣得养家糊口时，女人必须远离他的工作!
The woman must stay out of the husband's work when he earns her bread and butter!

471
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,500
查理……
Charlie...

472
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:40,894
哦,查理…像你这样地位的男人的妻子应该得到尊重，应该得到尊重来帮助他发展事业。
Oh, Charlie... The wife of a man in your position should have the regard and should have the respect to help him advance his career.

473
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,355
你不觉得吗?
Don't you think?

474
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,987
查理，我的东西你都可以拿走。
Charlie, you can have anything I own.

475
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,867
这一刻的痛苦……
The pain of this moment...

476
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,871
的记忆。
The memories.

477
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,668
我理解你的感受。
I understand how you feel.

478
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,423
先生们……
Gentlemen...

479
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,262
我道歉。
I apologize.

480
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,558
我们理解,斯坦利。
We understand, Stanley.

481
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,643
听到我的呼唤,斯坦利。
Hear me, Stanley.

482
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:27,065
查理主要担心的是过去，这本身就是一件值得称赞的事情，他想要拍出更好的电影。
Charlie's main worry in the past, and it's a commendable thing in itself, he wants to make better pictures.

483
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,693
我说到做到。我不是在跟你讨价还价斯坦利
I meant what I said. I'm not bargaining with you, Stanley.

484
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,903
你没资格讨价还价!
You're not in a bargaining position!

485
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,030
但这是真的，我不能强迫你签字，对吧?
But it's true, I can't force you to sign, can I?

486
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,784
-那正是你想做的!——查理,斯坦利……闭嘴,nat !
- That's just what you're trying to do! - Charlie, Stanley... Shut up, nat!

487
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:45,667
哦，查尔斯，查尔斯，我不得不对此感到非常抱歉。
Oh, Charles, Charles, I'm going to have to take this very much amiss.

488
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,504
我向你伸出手，你却朝我脸上吐口水。
I offer you my hand, and you spit in my face.

489
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:54,467
不，不，斯坦利，查理……斯坦利，我要你放我走。我们不喜欢对方。
No, no, Stanley, Charlie... Stanley, I want you to let me go. We don't like each other.

490
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,678
我知道，你也知道
I know that, you know it.

491
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,348
你要什么我都答应只要你放我走。
I'll promise you anything you want if you'll just let me go.

492
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,142
斯坦利，求你了，听他说。
Stanley, please, listen to him.

493
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:07,147
这是他发自内心的要求。闭嘴!
He's asking this from the bottom of his soul... Shut up!

494
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,193
查尔斯，我庄严宣誓放弃现实主义。
Charles, I solemnly abjure realism.

495
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,574
我需要你出现在场地上。
I need your physical presence on the lot.

496
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,328
我需要你的身体，不是你的善意。
I need your body, not your goodwill.

497
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:28,126
现在，查理，我要你用一根结束第二次世界大战的笔在这张纸上签名。
Now, Charlie, I want you to sign this paper with one of the pens that ended the second world war.

498
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:32,297
伟大的美国将军道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟曾使用过这种方法。
This was used by a great American, general Douglas MacArthur.

499
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:48,146
查尔斯……我无法告诉你，在这一刻，有多少个月的建设性梦想已经过去了，我不会让任何人，或任何事情，阻碍这一梦想的实现。
Charles... I can't tell you how many long months of constructive dreaming have gone in this moment, and I will let nobody, or nothing, stand in the way of that dream.

500
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:55,111
我最后再问你一次……求你了，放我走吧。
I'm asking you for the last time... Please, let me go.

501
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,781
我不能强迫你签字，对吧?
I can't force you to sign, can I?

502
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,415
我可以吗?
Can I?

503
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,357
祝贺你,基蒂。
Congratulations, kitty.

504
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,653
复制的查理的。
The copy's Charlie's.

505
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,117
我留着这支笔。
I'll keep the pen.

506
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,955
这是我唯一的证据证明战争已经结束或者曾经打过仗。
It's my only proof that the war is over or that it was ever fought.

507
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,543
查尔斯，我们都爱你!
Charles, we all love you!

508
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:57,549
你是个伟大的艺术家，所以我们必须学会对这些喜怒无常的行为有所期待。
You're a great artist, so we must learn to expect these temperamental actions.

509
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,512
从现在开始，查理，你的问题就是我的问题。
From now on, Charlie, your problems are my problems.

510
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:08,852
尽管打电话。你最轻微的心愿，你的牵挂……凯蒂，你今晚怎么了?
Never hesitate to call. Your slightest wish, your worries... What's with you tonight, kitty?

511
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,563
某一团体发现自己非常着迷。
A certain party finds itself very fascinated.

512
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:17,569
是啊，但我说了，我现在很忙。
Yeah, but like I said, I'm all tied up.

513
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,572
当然,基蒂。
Sure, kitty.

514
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:27,203
- Nat，我正开车经过你办公室。-不了，谢谢，我要去卡尔弗城。
- Nat, I'm driving by your office. - No, thank you, I'm going to culver city.

515
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,840
再见,nat。
Goodbye, nat.

516
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,762
亲爱的，我知道你的感受。
Darling, I know how you feel.

517
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,765
老人知道。
The old man knows.

518
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:52,187
他扭了我的脖子，就像我是一个10美分的布娃娃。
He twisted my neck like I was a 10-cent rag doll.

519
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,565
不像你搞得那么糟。
It's not so terrible as you're making out.

520
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,984
就像我是个小布娃娃。
Like I was a little rag doll.

521
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,781
你在一个简单的基本事实中创造了一段时间。
You're making a whole tzimmes out of a simple basic fact.

522
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,366
7年的经济保障。
Seven years of financial security.

523
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:10,205
亲爱的，从长远来看。
Darling, take the long view.

524
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:16,252
看起来……我该怎么办?
Look... what could I do?

525
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,421
Nat ?
Nat?

526
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,437
见到你,nat。
See you, nat.

527
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,275
喂?
Hello?

528
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,780
当然,马里昂。在这里。
Sure, Marion. Right here.

529
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,721
你好,天使。
Hello, angel.

530
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:18,022
马里昂,等待……我想你应该知道，霍夫来过。
Marion, wait... I think you ought to know, hoff was here.

531
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,405
是的,我……喂?
Yes, I... Hello?

532
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,740
喂?
Hello?

533
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,812
一个人喝吗，查理?秘密恶习?
Drinking by yourself, Charlie? Secret vices?

534
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,485
看看风把什么吹进来了。太太幸福。
Look what the wind blew in. Mrs. Bliss.

535
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,073
不是朋友吗?他的秘书说他在。
Isn't buddy here? His secretary said he was.

536
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,080
-我要喝一杯，查理。——帮助自己。
- I need a drink, Charlie. - Help yourself.

537
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,259
-马里恩还在海滩?-是的。
- Marion still at the beach? - Yeah.

538
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,184
你应该把门锁上，查理。
You should keep your door locked, Charlie.

539
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,396
你可能会被绑架，然后被勒索一大笔赎金。
You could be kidnapped and held for a delicious ransom.

540
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,861
我想我要一些龙舌兰。龙舌兰酒总是让我兴奋。
I think I'll have some Tequila. Tequila always makes me frisky.

541
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,614
再来点龙舌兰吗，查理?
You want some more Tequila, Charlie?

542
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,159
-你从哪儿来的，活泼小姐?-在friscotti餐厅吃午餐。
- Where did you come from, frisky miss? - Lunch at friscotti's.

543
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,496
跟那个二流神经病沃尔登一起吗?
Oh, with that second-class neurotic, walden?

544
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,874
-你怎么知道?-小镇啊。
- How'd you know? - Oh, small town.

545
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,132
我的宝贝。
My baby.

546
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,685
在这里。
Right here.

547
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,857
你已经在20个不同的派对上逼着我了。
You've cornered me at 20 different parties.

548
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,985
为什么我喝醉的时候你总能嗅出我?
Why do you always sniff me out when I'm drunk?

549
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:13,364
-你喝醉了吗，查理?-煮到腮了。
- Are you drunk, Charlie? - Stewed to the gills.

550
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:19,120
红色的霓虹灯亮着，天空中满是醉醺醺的画眉。
The red neon lights are on and the sky is full of drunken blackbirds.

551
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,582
所以喝了你的酒，离开这里。
So drink your drink and get out of here.

552
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:29,380
查理，为什么要拘谨呢?我觉得你很有魅力。
Why stand on formality, Charlie? I find you very attractive.

553
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,966
你不在乎你对你丈夫做了什么，对吧?
You don't care what you do to your husband, do you?

554
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,928
你呢?
Do you?

555
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,184
伤害,男朋友。你伤害了我，亲爱的。
That hurts, boyfriend. You hurt me, darling.

556
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,353
我是一个淘气的女孩。我希望我能说我不喜欢它。
I'm a naughty girl. I wish I could say I didn't like it.

557
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,733
回家,康妮。
Go home, Connie.

558
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,235
你妈妈需要你。
Your mother wants you.

559
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:58,493
哦!生活是美好的，不是吗，查理?
Oh! Life's a sweet thing, isn't it, Charlie?

560
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,163
这是哥们永远不会理解的。
That's something buddy will never understand.

561
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,831
听着，我喜欢兄弟。
Look, I like buddy.

562
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,126
去年，我差点就离开了，伙计。
Last year, I almost left buddy.

563
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:19,180
但后来…那件可怕的事发生了，当然，我必须扮演好自己的角色，尤其是因为这一切都牵扯进来了。
But then... That terrible thing came up, and, of course, I had to play my part, especially since it all got so involved.

564
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,726
-你说"参与"是什么意思?-别说了，查理。
- What do you mean, "involved"? - Stop it, Charlie.

565
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,605
你以为我不知道那哥们为了你进了监狱吗?
Don't you think I know that buddy went to prison for you?

566
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:33,277
你以为我不知道你在车祸中杀死了那个孩子，而不是兄弟吗?
Don't you think I know that you killed that child in the auto accident not buddy?

567
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,490
巴迪告诉你的?
Buddy told you that?

568
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,867
伙计，你是世界上的英雄。
You're the hero of the world to buddy.

569
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,496
他会为你进监狱，但告诉他妻子?
He'd go to prison for you, but tell his wife?

570
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:48,960
不，那晚那个英俊的微笑害羞的家伙打了两次电话。
No, that handsome smiley coy called twice that night.

571
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,840
他是非常重要的。他为什么要打电话给伙计?
He's very important. Now, why would he call buddy?

572
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:58,636
-所以我只是根据事实推断…-你的五分是歪的
- So I just put two and two together... - And you got a crooked five.

573
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:04,058
组织,查理。你喝醉了。
Get organized, Charlie. You're drunk.

574
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,810
我知道，我知道。
I know, I know.

575
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:10,773
那时我就来了，然后就是我和你说的:
That's when I come around, and then there's me and what you said:

576
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:16,320
"红色的霓虹灯和醉醺醺的画眉"
"Red neon lights and a sky full of drunken blackbirds."

577
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,329
这事让我很着急。
This quuor's got me in a hurry.

578
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,751
不要反抗，亲爱的。
Don't fight it, darling.

579
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,547
得到。
Get with it.

580
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,978
喂?
Hello?

581
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,909
天，我不知道，伙计。
Gee, I don't know, buddy.

582
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,120
你为什么认为她会在这里?
What makes you think that she'd be here?

583
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,709
现在还早。
It's early yet.

584
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,339
她可能在某个商店挥霍你的战利品。
She could be out in a store somewhere squandering your loot.

585
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,261
别光坐在屋子里，伙计。
Don't just sit in the house, ace.

586
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,848
出去，找个酒吧，加点调味汁。
Get out, find yourself a bar, sauce up.

587
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,559
确定。
Sure.

588
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:33,231
这是卡塞尔医生随时给蓝脾气的人开的处方。
That's Dr. Castle's prescription for the blue grumps anytime.

589
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,946
不,等等,老兄。不，你不能来这里。
No, wait, buddy. No, you can't come here.

590
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:44,075
我两分钟后就要出去了。我要见一个人。
I'm going out in about two minutes. I gotta see a fellow.

591
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:54,961
听着，我一挂电话，她可能就会进来，我现在就挂。
Look, she'll probably walk in as soon as I hang up, which is going to be right now.

592
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,005
不，别谢我，伙计。
No, don't thank me, buddy.

593
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,883
是的,我知道。
Yeah, I know.

594
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,054
是的，我知道，我知道。我知道我是个好男人!
Oh, yes, I know, I know. I know I'm a swell guy!

595
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,514
滚开!
Get out of here!

596
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,312
你又伤害我了，亲爱的。
You hurt me again, darling.

597
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,857
但你喜欢这样，不是吗?
But you like that, don't you?

598
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,903
有个词适合你。
There's a word for you.

599
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:25,116
为什么你不说呢，亲爱的?
Why don't you say it, darling?

600
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,122
-你最好离开这里，否则我…——我知道。
- You'd better get out of here before I... - I know.

601
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,124
我知道，我知道。
I know, I know.

602
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,626
听着，你是什么?
Look, what are you?

603
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,672
不，我是认真的。
No, I mean, seriously.

604
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,342
你相信什么?什么?
Just what do you believe in? What?

605
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:48,514
有趣，查理，不要忧郁。
Fun, Charlie, not gloomy thoughts.

606
00:46:49,932 --> 00:47:05,239
香水，青春永葆，各种各样的好东西，秘密和紧锁的门，享受进入我脑海的最狂野的事物。
Perfume and staying young, and goodies of every sort and description, and secrets and locked doors, and enjoying the wildest things that come into my mind.

607
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,921
你为什么不回家，康妮?你妈妈在找你。
Why don't you go home, Connie? Your mother's looking for you.

608
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:26,218
我要回家了，查理，一会儿就回家。
I'll go home, Charlie, in a little while.

609
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,845
过一会儿。
In a little while.

610
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,640
你做那个，你做那个小事情，因为我有大麻烦了。
You do that, you do that little thing, because I've got some big trouble.

611
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,976
我不需要你给我添麻烦。
I don't need you for more trouble.

612
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,189
我被自己的烂泥和霓虹灯弄得晕头转向。
I'm getting sloshed in my own mud and neon lights.

613
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,405
——你好,马里昂。——嗨,尼克。
- Hello, Marion. - Hi, Nicky.

614
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,367
没关系，但别太久。他得吃午饭。
It's all right, but don't be too long. He has to have his lunch.

615
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,829
-比利，回头见。——再见。
- Billy, see you later. - Bye.

616
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,012
-他感冒好了，是吧?——上周。
- He got over his cold okay, huh? - Last week.

617
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,851
-我给你打了六七次电话。——我知道。
- I called you six or seven times. - I know.

618
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,563
你把我埋得很深，天使。
You buried me deep, angel.

619
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,024
听着，你能帮我个忙吗?
Listen, would you do me a big favor?

620
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,985
——什么?-今晚来吃饭吧。
- What? - Come to dinner tonight.

621
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,863
-你是说在家里?-是的。
- You mean at the house? - Yeah.

622
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,825
我得为兄弟做点事。
I have to do something for buddy.

623
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,411
帕蒂·本尼迪克特的事之后他就一直躲着我。
He's been avoiding me since that Patty Benedict bit.

624
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,456
他觉得他让我失望了。我不知道。
He thinks he let me down or something. I don't know.

625
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,208
他在前台遇到了麻烦。
He's in trouble with the front office.

626
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,628
汉克邀请我今晚和他共进晚餐。
Hank asked me to have dinner with him tonight.

627
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,299
好吧，把他带来。
Well, bring him along.

628
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:33,304
-我邀请了七点钟的祝福。-好的，我们六点半到。
- I've invited the blisses for 7:00. - All right, we'll be there at 6:30.

629
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,977
因为我要来家里吃晚餐，这并不意味着什么。
Because I'm coming to dinner at the house, it doesn't mean anything.

630
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,896
风格。
Natch.

631
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,943
“好吧，到你那边去。
'All right, into your corner.

632
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:57,077
“三个,四个…“…5、6……“…7、8、9。
'Three, four... '...five, six... '...seven, eight, nine.

633
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,132
“来吧，别闹了。
'Come on, break it up.

634
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:14,761
分开。
'Break it up.

635
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,615
“九，十，你出局了。”
'Nine, ten and you're out.'

636
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,139
拍得不错，对吧，小子?
That was a great picture, huh, boy?

637
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,393
嘿，查理，那家伙是谁?这是卡斯吗?
Hey, Charlie, who was that guy? Was that cass?

638
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,770
是的。拉尔夫也是裁判，记住。
Yeah. Ralph was referee, too, remember.

639
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,856
谁的饮料需要加糖?马里恩?康妮?
Whose drink wants sweetening? Marion? Connie?

640
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,317
汉克，你为什么不停下来?
Hank, why don't you break down?

641
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,820
我都快喜欢上这个了。
It's getting so I almost like this stuff.

642
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,406
嘿，我们不是要去隔壁参加蒙提的派对吗?
Hey, aren't we all going next door to monty's party?

643
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,325
康妮，你得原谅我。我头痛得厉害。
Connie, you'll have to excuse me. I've got a rotten headache.

644
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,202
哦，真遗憾。
Oh, what a shame.

645
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,330
是的，你们这些孩子快走。也许我们晚点再来找你。
Yeah, you kids run along. Maybe we'll catch up with you later.

646
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,957
好的,英俊。
Okay, handsome.

647
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,127
我们步行还是开车?——开车。
- Shall we walk or drive? - Drive.

648
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,380
如果把车停在外面，醉鬼就会整晚都进来。
Leave a lot of cars out front, and the drunks will be dropping in all night.

649
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,466
-这电影有多久了?-八九年。
- How old is that picture? - Eight, nine years.

650
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,552
——为什么?-嘿，你刚才很激动。
- Why? - Hey, you had a lot of steam.

651
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,178
他的确做到了。
He certainly did.

652
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,224
-回见，没信仰的人-没信仰的人？
- See you later, faithless. - Faithless?

653
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,851
谢谢你,查尔斯。
Thanks, Charles.

654
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,478
-晚安，玛丽安。-晚安，康妮。
- Good night, Marion. - Good night, Connie.

655
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,023
-晚安，汉克。——晚安。
- Good night, Hank. - Good night.

656
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,111
汉克，你觉得这电影怎么样?
What did you think of the picture, Hank?

657
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,364
我一直在想如果你输了那场大战会怎么样。
I kept wondering what would've happened if you lost the big fight.

658
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:06,123
违反商业道德的。那孩子还以为他在为水星乐队和乐队写作，但结果就像霍夫叔叔说的"灾难"
Uncommercial. Kid still thinks he's writing for Mercury and the group, but it turned out to what uncle hoff described as "disaster".

659
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,708
你觉得怎么样?
What did you think of it?

660
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,711
我喜欢它的第一次，尽管结尾。
I liked it the first time, in spite of the ending.

661
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,006
你像只哭泣的鸟儿一样哀悼过去。
Well, you grieve for the past like a weeping bird.

662
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,674
汉克，你什么时候走?
When are you leaving, Hank?

663
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,386
-我是说，离开好莱坞。-星期二或星期三。
- I mean, leaving Hollywood. - Tuesday or Wednesday.

664
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,182
我想在你走之前见你一面。星期一怎么样?
I'd like to see you before you go. How about Monday?

665
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,601
-随你便。——好吧,星期一。
- Any time you say. - Okay, Monday.

666
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,398
-你在干什么?-汉克开车送我回海滩。
- What are you doing? - Hank's driving me back to the beach.

667
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,780
你现在就得走吗?我是说，现在还早，12:30左右。
Do you have to go now? I mean, it's early, 12:30 or so.

668
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,990
我们就不能坐下来谈谈吗?
Can't we sit down and talk or something?

669
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,868
我很抱歉，查理，但你知道结果会怎样。
I'm sorry, Charlie, but you know where that leads.

670
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:49,249
亲爱的……我想也许我们三个，我们可以坐下来聊一聊。
Darling... I thought maybe the three of us, we'd just sit around and yack it up a bit.

671
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,584
请,不要走。
Please, don't go.

672
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,837
听着，如果你想狂饮一番，为什么不去蒙提家?
Look, if you want to yack it up, why don't you go over to monty's?

673
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,006
那里有很多聪明的人等着你。
There's lots of bright types there for you.

674
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,299
别紧张，亲爱的。
Take it easy, dear.

675
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,110
放轻松?这就是麻烦的开始。
Take it easy? That's where the trouble begins.

676
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:05,057
-来吧，做你自己。-这是另一个当地的说法，意思是“像我一样，不要做你自己。”
- Come on, now, be yourself. - That's another local remark, which means, "be just like me, don't be yourself."

677
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:09,353
-留下来再喝一杯。-我不需要了，谢谢。
- Stay and have just one more drink. - I don't need another one, thanks.

678
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:13,440
-汉克，再来杯咖啡怎么样?-不，谢谢，查理，到这里来。
- Hank, how about another cup of coffee? - No thanks, Charlie, up to here.

679
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:19,154
听着，有没有听过斯迈利关于咖啡豆和水草的故事?
Listen, ever hear smiley's story about the coffee bean and the water plant?

680
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:31,291
汉克……玛丽安告诉我你向她求婚了。
Hank... Marion tells me that you asked her to marry you.

681
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,584
是的,我做到了。
Yes, I did.

682
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,837
让我搞清楚。
Let me get this straight.

683
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:39,341
-你不是我的朋友吗?——是的,查理……那这个程序是什么?
- Aren't you my friend? - Yes, Charlie... Then what is this routine?

684
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,221
玛丽安让我想活下去。
Marion makes me want to live.

685
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,890
大多数人对我的影响是不同的。
Most people affect me differently.

686
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,227
查理，我很抱歉你不开心，但你几年前就失去她了。
Look, Charlie, I'm sorry you're unhappy, but you lost her years ago.

687
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,062
公平地说，你不能怪我。
In fairness, you can't blame me.

688
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,065
今晚我觉得不公平。你把你的天使翅膀藏哪了?
I don't feel fair tonight. Where did you stash your angel wings?

689
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,317
谁给你权利做这样的决定的?
Who gave you the right to make such a decision?

690
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,112
我唯一的权利是自己做决定。
My only right is to make my own decisions.

691
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,740
你的演讲就在沙发上。
That speech is right off the couch.

692
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,702
说实话吧，梦中男孩。玛丽安不会离开我的。
Get this straight, dreamboy. Marion isn't going to leave me.

693
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,537
我也自己做决定。
I make my own decisions, too.

694
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,372
-听…-不，我想回家。
- Listen... - No, I want to go home.

695
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,458
玛丽恩，你能让我说十句话吗?
Marion, would you let me say 10 words?

696
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,085
我想我还是在车里等好了。
I think it'll be easier if I wait in the car.

697
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,102
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

698
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,315
有时我不停地咆哮，好像我对你有什么不满似的。
Sometimes I rant and rave as though I had something against you.

699
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,277
但你一直对我很好，非常好。
But you've been good to me, so good to me.

700
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,572
你只对我好。
You're only good to me.

701
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:57,544
这一切都是一个凄凉、痛苦的梦，一盘真正的鸽子。
This is all a bleak, bitter dream, a real dish of doves.

702
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:04,468
你跑到这儿来，把一窝光着身子的鸽子扔到我面前，我能做什么，我能说什么?
You come in here and throw this nest of naked pigeons in my face, what can I do, what can I say?

703
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,154
只有两种方法可以忘记这一切。
There are only two ways to forget everything.

704
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,097
你要么喝醉，要么把铅笔插进眼睛。
You either get drunk, or you just stick a pencil in your eye.

705
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,518
查理，我明早要见律师。
Charlie, I'm seeing a lawyer in the morning.

706
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,730
玛丽恩，求你了，不要离开我。
Marion, please, don't leave me.

707
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,527
我发誓，我是无辜的，天使。
I swear, I'm innocent, angel.

708
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:29,243
我发誓当我用我的光芒魅力世人的时候，我会在我的衬衫下面流血而死。
I swear that while I'm charming the world with my light fantastic, I'm bleeding to death under my shirt.

709
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,749
你就不能和律师一起等吗，小天使?
Can't you wait with the lawyer, angel?

710
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,337
我是世界上最蠢的笨蛋吗?
Am I the worst oaf in the world?

711
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,298
世界这么大。
The world's a big place.

712
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,760
你是我这辈子最糟糕的人。
You're the worst one in my life.

713
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,407
谢谢你！
Thank you.

714
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,618
要我带你回去吗?
Do want me to take you back?

715
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:19,626
哦,汉克…玛丽安，你知道我爱你。为了你的幸福，我愿意做任何事。
Oh, Hank... Marion, you know I love you. I'll do anything for your happiness.

716
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,838
但求你了，别再两头为难了。
But please, stop playing both ends against the middle.

717
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,506
我不是故意的。
I don't mean to.

718
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,343
那么让我们来面对基本的问题。
Then let's face the basic problem.

719
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,555
这可以归结为一个简单的事实。
It boils down to a simple fact.

720
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:39,187
要么你还爱着他，想和他生活在一起，要么你不爱他，不想和他生活在一起。
Either you still love him and you want to live with him, or you don't love him and you don't want to live with him.

721
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:45,861
查理，求你了，别担心。一切都会好起来的。
Charlie, please, don't worry. It'll all work out.

722
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,991
-尼基，帮我个忙。——当然,查理。
- Nicky, do me a favor. - Sure, Charlie.

723
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,494
把我的睡袍和毯子拿来。
Get me my robe and a blanket.

724
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,625
-我今晚不想睡在上面。——确定。
- I don't want to sleep up there tonight. - Sure.

725
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:13,764
看,查理……如果你有麻烦，如果老尼克能帮上什么忙，任何事。
Look, Charlie... If you're in trouble, if there's anything old Nick can do, anything.

726
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,517
有人在家吗?Nang-nang-nang !
Anybody home? Nang-nang-nang!

727
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,228
我什么都没听到，什么都没听到。
I don't hear a thing, not a thing.

728
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,315
你从哪里来?隔壁吗?
Where did you come from? Next door?

729
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,485
是的。蒙蒂丽兹。一个真正的bash。
Yeah. Monty ritz. A real bash.

730
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,197
-真有趣，你在这里听不到。-不，我把门关着的。
- Funny, you couldn't hear it in here. - No, I had the door closed.

731
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:35,577
-听起来很疯狂。-所有的类型。你知道蒙蒂。
- It sounds wild. - All the types. You know monty.

732
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,329
和女孩们一起被抓?
Busted with the girls?

733
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,206
一切。
Everything.

734
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,502
-你感觉怎么样，凯蒂?——蓝色。
- How you feeling, kitty? - Blue.

735
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,796
就像我亲爱的宝贝的眼睛。
Like my dear baby's eyes.

736
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,674
-你觉得泰丝怎么样?——苔丝?
- What did you think of Tess? - Tess?

737
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,928
——昨晚。-那个红头发的。
- Last night. - Oh, the redhead.

738
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:58,809
她是天生的，但是…我不知道，我当时没心情。我想我失去了一个粉丝。
She was built, but... I don't know, I wasn't in the mood. I think I lost a fan.

739
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,436
我回到家读了一个小时的书。
I came home and read for an hour.

740
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,647
你在读什么?
What are you reading?

741
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,441
我不记得从哪一天到哪一天。
I don't remember from one day to another.

742
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,528
我今天下午看了汤米·默多克的新电影。
I saw Tommy murdock's new picture this afternoon.

743
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,948
-是啊，怎么样?——灾难。
- Yeah, how was it? - Disaster.

744
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:18,286
打牌还是下棋，还是玩拼字游戏再收你100块?
Cards or chess, or shall I take another $100 from you at scrabble?

745
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,414
不，这次我们不去了。
No, let's sit this one out.

746
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,750
你在做什么梦?
What are you dreaming about?

747
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,045
我想家了，想东方的四季。
I'm homesick for the east, the four seasons.

748
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,092
-你多大了，smiley?-一百万。
- How old are you, smiley? - A million.

749
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:39,182
但令我惊讶的是，我还这么年轻，居然还对迪克西·埃文斯这样的流浪汉发脾气。
But young enough, to my surprise, to still be losing my temper with a tramp like Dixie Evans.

750
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,312
-又怎么了?-她的嘴太大了。
- What's wrong now? - Her mouth's too big.

751
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:49,526
她在蒙蒂的派对上，喝醉了。“他在那儿，”她说。
She's over at monty's party, drunk. "There he is," she says.

752
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:54,281
我转过身，看到她坐在那里，可爱得像剥了皮的半熟火腿。
I turn around, and there she sits, cute as a skinned parboiled ham.

753
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:58,160
“我们知道一些事情，smiley和我，不是吗?”她说。
"We know something, smiley and me, don't we?" She says.

754
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,620
我一直想让玛丽安回到我身边。
I've been trying to get Marion to come back to me.

755
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,205
——是吗?-是的。
- Yeah? - Yeah.

756
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,501
我只需要这些，就能让她发现车祸那晚我车里有个女孩。
That's all I need, for her to find out I had a girl in the car the night of the accident.

757
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,171
迪克西在很多地方都有这样的暗示。
Dixie's been hinting like that in quite a few spots.

758
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,966
-你觉得她有恶意吗?-谁知道什么是伤害?
- You think she means any harm? - Who knows harm?

759
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,886
她一直都很喜欢你，凯蒂。
She's always liked you, kitty.

760
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,864
打电话给她，让她过来。笑一点。
Call her up, have her come over. Laugh a little.

761
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:22,684
你担心吗?你在担心什么?你可以做上千件事。
You're worried? What are you worried about? You can do a thousand things.

762
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,977
一个名字。
Name one.

763
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,813
-收买她。-我们签了合同。
- Buy her off. - We did, with a contract.

764
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,733
哦,是的。她是不诚实的。她不会被收买的。
Oh, yes. She's dishonest. She won't stay bought.

765
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,571
-叫她过来，凯蒂。——好的。
- Call her over, kitty. - All right.

766
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,951
为了我的艺术，什么都可以。
Anything for my art.

767
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,581
女人,女人,女人。
Women, women, women.

768
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,084
是蒙提的小女孩在唱歌。
It's monty's little girl singing.

769
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,044
好声音。
Nice voice.

770
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,962
你应该看看她。
You should see her.

771
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,507
——可爱,嗯?——梭鱼。
- Cute, huh? - A barracuda.

772
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:59,221
喂?迪克西·埃文斯小姐在吗?
Hello? Miss Dixie Evans is there?

773
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:04,601
埃文斯。是的。请接她好吗?
Evans. Yes. Would you get her, please?

774
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,855
听起来像是在开枪什么的。
Sounds like they're shooting off guns or something.

775
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,482
羚羊的一种。
Bongos.

776
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,069
-那里有很多女人?——加载。
- A lot of women there? - Loaded.

777
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,864
凯蒂，你觉得女人怎么样?
What do you think of women, kitty?

778
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:21,868
世界上有他们的一席之地。
There's room in the world for them.

779
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,453
迪克西?
Dixie?

780
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,165
我听不见你说什么。谁?
I can't hear you. Who?

781
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,756
真的吗?你不是在开玩笑吧?
Really? You're not ribbing me?

782
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,050
别闹了，好吗，亲爱的?
Knock it off, will you, honey?

783
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,387
不，不是你，查理。有人和我在一起。
No, not you, Charlie. There's somebody here with me.

784
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:43,473
当然，这是一个很棒的聚会。你在哪里?
Sure, it's a great party. Where are you?

785
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,017
这里太吵了。
There's so much noise here.

786
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,436
-你能让他停下来吗?-没事的。
- Would you please get him to stop? - It's all right.

787
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,415
-不，我有个很重要的电话。-没事的，宝贝，他会安静的。
- No, I have a very important call. - It's all right, honey, he'll be quiet.

788
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:56,319
喂?查理，在你的泳池里游泳?
Hello? Gee, Charlie, a swim in your pool now?

789
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,946
我很乐意。
Well, I'd love to.

790
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,031
听着，我怎么去那里?
Listen, how do I get there?

791
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,199
是吗?
Yeah?

792
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,994
听着，你能别闹了吗，亲爱的?
Look, will you cut it out, please, honey?

793
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,370
嗯?
Huh?

794
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,248
听着，我要蒙蒂的车。
Look, I'll take monty's car.

795
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,876
是啊，你知道我从不走路。
Yeah, you know I never walk anywhere.

796
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,171
是的,马上。医师。我很乐意!
Yeah, right away. Pronto. I'd love to!

797
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,048
哦，在所有的类型中!
Oh, of all the types!

798
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:22,637
这是我一个月来遇到的第一件好事。
The first nice thing that's happened to me in a month of Tuesdays.

799
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,643
再见,亲爱的。
Bye, honey.

800
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:33,773
小心你对迪克西说的话，查理。别再给她口实了。
Careful what you say to Dixie, Charlie. Don't give her any more ammunition.

801
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,067
听着，你有没有提出买断她的合同?
Listen, have you offered to buy her contract up?

802
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,821
-两个月前。什么都没有。——两个月?
- Two months ago. Nothing. - Two months?

803
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,157
你是说，她泄密这么久了?
You mean, she's been blabbing that long?

804
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:47,495
朗根这个愚蠢的小流浪汉。只有一点点力量的两个零。
Longen the stupid little tramp. Two bits worth of nothing with a little power.

805
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,458
-她不想要更多的钱?-她不知道自己想要什么。
- She doesn't want more money? - She doesn't know what she wants.

806
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,793
我敢打赌，我们得除掉她。
I'm betting even money, we have to get rid of her.

807
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,587
很好。你是怎么做到的?
Fine. How do you work that?

808
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,811
——晚安,查理。——晚安。
- Goodnight, Charlie. - Goodnight.

809
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,193
你是怎么做到的?
How do you work that?

810
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,362
没有标准的程序。
There's no standard procedure.

811
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,489
你是做什么的，把她往东运吗?
What do you do, ship her east?

812
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:26,409
查理，她一张嘴就说个不停。
Charlie, she's all mouth, all gab.

813
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,080
所以我们得把它修好她再也不能张嘴了。
So we've got to get it fixed she never opens her mouth again.

814
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,583
那我们就等着看事态的发展吧。
Well, let's wait and see the developments.

815
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,294
我想我能和她谈谈。
I think I can talk to her.

816
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,301
我今晚有点迷糊。
I'm a little fuzzy tonight.

817
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,681
你说的话很有趣，笑眯眯的，但我没看到你笑。
You're saying funny things, smiley, but I don't see you smiling.

818
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,809
你说"她再也不开口"是什么意思
What do you mean, "she never opens her mouth again?"

819
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,353
——就是这样。——什么?
- That's it. - What's it?

820
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,983
查理，她必须被移走。
Charlie, she'll have to be removed.

821
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,985
删除吗?
Removed?

822
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,445
抱歉把生肉扔到地上了。
Sorry to throw the raw meat on the floor.

823
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,950
事实就像岩石一样，有一定的尺寸和重力。
A fact, like a rock, has certain dimensions and gravity.

824
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,577
我把所有的选项一个一个看了一遍。
I've gone over all the choices, one by one.

825
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,456
你会成为一个很棒的演员。
You'd make a great actor.

826
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,711
-生活就是个奇怪的小人，凯蒂。——是的,基蒂。
- Life's a queer little man, kitty. - Yeah, kitty.

827
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,632
-史丹利知道些什么?-只知道他想知道的。
- What does Stanley know about this? - Only what he wants to know.

828
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,219
他每年付给我七万五千英镑是有原因的，凯蒂。
There's a reason he pays me £75,000 a year, kitty.

829
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:33,977
-有那么一分钟，我想…-查理，你是个爱幻想的人。
- For a minute there, I thought... - Charlie, you're a fanciful type.

830
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:37,522
在我这行，你得了解类型。把你的类型。
In my end of the business, you have to know types. Take your type.

831
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,984
怀着渺茫希望的武士吟游诗人。
The warrior minstrel with a forlorn hope.

832
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,529
这是你,娃娃。
That's you, doll.

833
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,614
这是南方。我从后门溜出去。
That's Dixie. I'll slide out the back way.

834
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,784
"抱着渺茫希望的武士吟游诗人"等待。
"Warrior minstrel with the forlorn hope." Wait.

835
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,578
那是什么?
What's that from?

836
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,747
这是爱尔兰人常说的一句话。
It's a phrase the Irish used to understand.

837
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,709
你了解我的，我来自那些愤世嫉俗的凯尔特人。
You know me, I'm from those cynical celts.

838
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,961
理想,基蒂?现在吗?
Ideals, kitty? Nowadays?

839
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,840
一个失落的十字军东征。
A lost crusade.

840
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,886
不要研究生活，查理。要习惯它。
Don't study life, Charlie. Get used to it.

841
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,638
嘿，你转移话题了。
Hey, you changed the subject.

842
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,683
你想记住我今晚说的一切吗?
You bothering to remember everything I said tonight?

843
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,852
祝你有个好梦,基蒂。
Pleasant dreams, kitty.

844
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,232
微笑,听着。
Smiley, listen.

845
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,736
查理?
Charlie?

846
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,949
查理?
Charlie?

847
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,039
门没锁，所以我直接走了进去。
The door wasn't locked, so I walked right in.

848
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,458
好久不见了，查理。
Long time, no see, Charlie.

849
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,169
那就用威士忌漱口吧。
Well, wash my mouth out with whiskey.

850
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,225
我正在喝白兰地。
I'm drinking Brandy.

851
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:58,686
如果我再喝一杯，就会看到一条蛇。
If I take one more drink, I'll see a snake.

852
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,861
拿一个轻的。别傻了。
Take a light one. Don't be silly.

853
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,823
好吧，你这个受虐狂。
All right, you masochist.

854
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,451
给我一杯加苏打水的苏格兰威士忌。
Give me a scotch and soda.

855
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,911
我知道。
I know.

856
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,919
你怎么知道我参加了蒙蒂的派对?
How did you know I was at monty's party?

857
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,632
哦，你是个骗子。
Oh, you're a faker.

858
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,260
你人很好，但我不信任你。
You're very sweet, but I don't trust you.

859
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:36,266
听……-谁在家?-只有蟋蟀。
Listen... - Who's at home? - Only the crickets.

860
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:43,022
查理……-你为什么不再喜欢我了?-我喜欢你，迪克西
Charlie... - Why don't you like me anymore? - I like you, Dixie.

861
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:49,237
自从那天我和你还有你的探员坐在这张椅子上之后就再没见过你了。
Oh, I haven't seen you since that very day I sat in this here chair with you and your agents.

862
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,824
当我问他们要合同的时候，他们很震惊。
Then I shocked them when I asked for my contract.

863
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,993
亲爱的，老纳特是老手了。
Old nat's been around, honey.

864
01:05:55,118 --> 01:06:00,331
整个大工作室，当我想到他们做的和说的一些事情。
And that whole big studio, when I think of some of the things they do and say.

865
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,041
如?
Such as?

866
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,504
只有身材好的女孩才会知道。
You've got to be a girl with a good figure to know.

867
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:10,508
还有一些人在雨天的下午。
And some of those guys on a rainy afternoon.

868
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,802
我真想把他们的脑袋给砸了。
I'd like to brain 'em.

869
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,433
你知道我身材很匀称吗?
Did you know that I'm perfectly proportioned?

870
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,268
-不是吗?——是的。
- Well, aren't I? - Yes.

871
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:25,398
当然，我现在明白了气质比体型和大小重要得多。
Of course, I understand now that temperament is much more important than shape and size.

872
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,692
但我还是不愿意戴眼镜。
But it's like I still won't get glasses.

873
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:31,446
你知道，我看不见街对面。但是眼镜很丑，不是吗?
You know, I can't see across the street. But glasses are ugly, aren't they?

874
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,239
谁惹我生气了?
Who wound me up?

875
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,782
到这里来。
Come here.

876
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,329
那为什么在我年轻激动人心的生活中，我很少见到你呢?
So why don't I see you more often in my young and thrilling life?

877
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,540
给，来一针卡塞尔医生的止痛药。
Here, have a shot of Dr. Castle's pain killer.

878
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,168
蛇油。
Snake oil.

879
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,130
我才不管有没有看到蛇。
I don't care if I do see a snake.

880
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,426
我肯定我更愿意看到一条蛇，而不是一个好莱坞制片人。
I'm sure I'd much rather see a snake than a Hollywood producer.

881
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:58,306
谁发明了苏打水?他们是怎么做的?
Who invented soda? How do they make it?

882
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,308
哦，真是个怪人!
Ooh, what a weirdie!

883
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,353
你是唯一一个这么叫我的人。
You're the only one who can call me that.

884
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:05,230
我来告诉你为什么。
I'll tell you why.

885
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,023
我喜欢你，查理。
I like you, Charlie.

886
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,777
你一直对我很好，很体贴。
You've been very kind and considerate to me.

887
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,781
这是我特殊记忆盒里的一件非常特别的事。
And that is a very special matter in my special memory box.

888
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,412
我打算养只狗。贵宾犬。
I'm going to get a dog. A poodle.

889
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,251
你喜欢狮子狗吗?大的还是小的?
- Do you like poodles? - Big or little?

890
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,253
我来告诉你为什么。
I'll tell you why.

891
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:33,091
我16岁的时候，我的家人把我赶出了家门。
When I was 16, my family threw me out of the house.

892
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,093
这让你非常紧张。
That makes you very nervous.

893
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:38,263
我是说，这种事让你很敏感。
I mean, a thing like that makes you very touchy.

894
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,391
他们只是觉得我输了。
They just kind of gave me up for lost.

895
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:48,398
直到今天，我母亲还不能告诉父亲我给他们寄钱。
To this very day, my mother can't tell my father that I send them money.

896
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,984
天主教徒信奉大家庭。
Catholics believe in large families.

897
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,487
但我告诉你，我现在正在存钱。
But I'll tell you what, I'm saving my money now.

898
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,365
我在等待白马王子的到来。
I'm waiting for Mr. Right to come along.

899
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,576
如果我在这附近遇到他。
If I ever meet the guy around here.

900
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,246
我在好莱坞名声扫地。
My name is mud in Hollywood.

901
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,417
-嘿，我烦你了吗?-不，亲爱的，不。
- Hey, am I boring you? - No, honey, no.

902
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,253
我喜欢听你说实话。
I like to hear you talk honest.

903
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,798
我知道你想干什么，查理。
I know what you're trying to do, Charlie.

904
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,133
什么?
What?

905
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:19,345
让我忘记你答应过我的游泳。
Make me forget about the swim you promised me.

906
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,432
如果可以的话，他们会淹死我的，那个工作室。
They'd drown me if they could, that studio.

907
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,434
为什么?
Why?

908
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,604
我针。
I needle them.

909
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:31,941
我一直在暗示你的事故。这让他们对改变感到紧张。
I keep hinting about your accident. It makes them nervous for a change.

910
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:36,487
你要小心。霍夫是个鳄鱼脾气的人。
You want to be careful. Hoff's a man with a crocodile's temper.

911
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,742
别跟我说霍夫先生。
Don't tell me about Mr. Hoff.

912
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,912
前一分钟还叫我孩子，甚至连脸都没变……
Calling me a child one minute, and without even changing his face...

913
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,002
你不像我那样从底层看待这些人，查理。
You don't see those people from the bottom like I do, Charlie.

914
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:58,343
-你是一个白手起家的成功人士。-迪克西…饶了我吧，拜托了?
- You're a successful self-made man. - Dixie... Why don't you give me a break, please?

915
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,511
当然,查理,亲爱的。如何?
Sure, Charlie, dear. How?

916
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:07,226
每次你说起那次事故，你知道的…哦，查理，别这样!
Well, every time that you talk about the accident, you know... Oh, Charlie, don't be like that!

917
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:10,063
你不用怕我。
You have nothing to be afraid of from me.

918
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,898
我不会说梦话的。
I don't talk in my sleep.

919
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,277
-所以别担心。-但我很担心，小酒窝。
- So don't worry. - But I am worried, dimples.

920
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:23,534
某天晚上，你会在不经意间喝得大醉……但我现在已经喝得酩酊大醉了，而且我还没告诉你你不知道的事，对吧?
Some night, you'll have a skinful and inadvertently... But I've got a skinful now, and I didn't tell you anything you didn't know already, did I?

921
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:28,873
比如萨米·伯克。他带走了这个女孩…迪克西!
Like about Sammy Burke for instance. Now, he took this girl... Dixie!

922
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,294
你现在才告诉我。
You're telling me now.

923
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,757
那是因为你问我的。
That's because you asked me.

924
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,134
不，我没问你。
No, I didn't ask you.

925
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:47,475
我只是举个例子。查理，亲爱的，我知道该停在哪里。
I'm only giving you an example. Charlie, dear, I know where to stop.

926
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,895
但我看不出有什么理由让他们好过。
But I don't see any reason to make it easy on them.

927
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,856
我讨厌他们。
I hate them.

928
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:58,695
我的合同上写着"演员"但他们雇我是为了我的身材，不是为了演戏。
You know, it says "actress" on my contract, but they hired me for my figure, not to act.

929
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,823
-但你一直在演戏。——那些部分?
- But you've been acting. - Those bits?

930
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:06,035
两年内有三个抽香烟的女孩。这叫演戏吗?
Three cigarette girls in two whole years. You call that acting?

931
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,956
“接下来是重要的部分。下周测试你们。
"Big part coming up. Testing you next week.

932
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,417
“你不出来吃饭吗?”
"Won't you come out to dinner?"

933
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,544
下周永远不会到来。
And next week never comes.

934
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,216
查理，他们雇像我这样的女孩来招待来访的参展商。
Charlie, they hire girls like me to entertain the visiting exhibitors.

935
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,052
我们会跳舞，会穿衣服。
We know how to dance and dress.

936
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,513
衣服从衣柜里出来了。
The clothes come out of wardrobe.

937
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,598
这比他们…
It's cheaper than if they...

938
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:34,313
我是免赔项目。他们把我排除在外了!
I'm a deductible item. They write me off the books!

939
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,860
听我叔叔的话，柯利牧羊犬。你为什么不回去…那糟糕的工作室!
Listen to uncle, collie dog. Why don't you go back... That lousy studio!

940
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,280
他们把你弄得一团糟，然后叫你虱子!
They louse you up, and then they call you a louse!

941
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,747
诚实,查理……
Honest, Charlie...

942
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,376
你不会生气吗?
Wouldn't you be mad?

943
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,171
当然我会的。
Sure I would.

944
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,883
嗯,那里。看到了吗?
Well, there. See?

945
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:13,019
看看这个。这是我学到的。
Look at this bit. It's what I learned.

946
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:19,942
可爱的小宝贝……你答应过我的游泳池在哪儿?
Dearie... Where is zis swimming pool you promised me?

947
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,362
在这里。来了。
Here. Coming right up.

948
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,573
充满了白兰地。
Filled with Brandy.

949
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:30,745
因为孩子，不能让她久等。哦!
Because the baby, she cannot be kept waiting. Oh!

950
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,959
有人站在那儿吗?
Hey, is there somebody standing there?

951
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,350
这是我的妻子。
This is my wife.

952
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,311
埃文斯小姐。
Miss Evans.

953
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,105
呃…很高兴见到你，卡塞尔夫人。
Er... pleased to meet you, Mrs. Castle.

954
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,778
呃…我们在聊天。
Er... we were having a conversation.

955
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,990
我得回去参加蒙提的派对了，查理。
Well, I've got to get back to monty's party now, Charlie.

956
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:12,411
谢谢你的酒和对我事业的建议。
Thanks for the drink and the advice about my career.

957
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:15,331
当然,迪克西。谢谢你过来。
Sure, Dixie. Thanks for coming over.

958
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,128
非常愉快。
It's been very pleasant.

959
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:26,592
但是，查理，我说的关于工作室的话都是认真的。
But, Charlie, I meant everything I said about the studio.

960
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,263
晚安,Castle夫人
Goodnight, Mrs. Castle.

961
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,977
还好我没在游泳池里发现亚当和夏娃。
Lucky I didn't find Adam and Eve in the swimming pool.

962
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,689
-你错了，她有点…-我不管她是什么。
- You're wrong, she's a little... - I don't care what she is.

963
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:44,318
抱歉，明白了，但你大错特错了，我赌60块你错了。
I'm sorry, clear, but you're very wrong, and I'll bet you $60 you're wrong.

964
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,820
看。
Look.

965
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:53,035
我正准备睡觉，突然发生了一件事……我不知道为什么我的心一分钟跑一英里。
I was getting ready to go to bed, and a certain matter came up... Why my heart should be going a mile a minute, I don't know.

966
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,705
叫辆出租车，好吗?
Call a cab, will you?

967
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,542
好吧，我自己叫。
All right, I'll call it myself.

968
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:02,879
马里恩……
Marion...

969
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,383
你就不能看着我，看清真相吗?
Can't you look at me and see the truth?

970
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,219
我来得有点太早了。这是真相。
I arrived a little too soon. That's the truth.

971
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:14,515
我让汉克开车从布伦特伍德送我回来因为我真的以为你需要我。
I had Hank drive me back from brentwood because I really thought you needed me.

972
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,685
我真是太蠢了才会再考虑你，不是吗?
I'm all kinds of a fool to give you a second thought, aren't I?

973
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,270
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

974
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,815
那你想从我这里得到什么?明亮的对话?
So what do you want from me? Bright dialogue?

975
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,443
聪明机智的东西?
Something brilliant and witty?

976
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,364
是什么让您这么着急呢?
What's your hurry?

977
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:34,577
你可以随时叫出租车。你有一整晚的时间叫出租车!
You can call a cab anytime. You've got all night to call a cab!

978
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,164
你是个很会戏剧性退场的小个子。
You're a great little one for dramatic exits.

979
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:42,126
但我想这是我们的终点了。我们得把它摆到桌子上!
But I think this is the end of the line. We've got to get it out on the table!

980
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,962
——坐下来。-不用了，谢谢。
- Sit down. - No, thank you.

981
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:49,091
如果你以为我会留在这里听你的，那你就错了。
If you think I'm going to stay here and listen to you, you're mistaken.

982
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:54,722
- - - - - -闭嘴!-我正要…让我说话。
- Shut up! - I've just about taken... Let me talk.

983
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:01,062
别逼我回到我一贯的自我辩解的立场。
Don't push me back into my usual position of self-justification.

984
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:12,198
现在，我们要扔掉一串烂葡萄那就是我，就是你感觉的我，但我得说，我觉得你的判断力很差。
For the time being, we'll throw away a bunch of rotten grapes that's me, that you seem to feel is me, though I must say, I think your judgment is lousy.

985
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:15,284
你用锤子打我鼻子上的苍蝇!
You SWAT the fly on my nose with a hammer!

986
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,452
扔掉它。
Throw it away.

987
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:20,289
但我们每次谈话，都是关于查理·卡塞尔!
Yet every time we talk, it's about Charlie castle!

988
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:26,754
从没提过他那长期受苦，多病的妻子，玛丽安。
Never once about his long-suffering, sickly wife, Marion.

989
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:31,175
你知道你致命的错误在哪里吗?
Do you know where your fatal error lies?

990
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,844
你应该知道，所以我来告诉你。
You ought to know, so I'm going to tell you.

991
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:38,182
你被一种高尚的商人心理折磨着。
You're afflicted with a fine, fat case of merchant psychology.

992
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:41,811
你讨价还价，玩弄你自己的本性。这是你的错误。
You bargain and trifle with your own nature. That's your error.

993
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:46,148
今晚，你可能会毁了你的生活当然还有我的。
Tonight, you're about to possibly destroy your life and certainly mine.

994
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,568
我们不是从无数人中挑出了彼此吗?
Didn't we pick each other out of millions?

995
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:53,030
能不能像商人那样说:
Can this be bargained away by saying, like a merchant:

996
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:59,704
"马里昂会做她自己，爱查理"除非他满足一定的价格和条件"
"Marion will be herself and love Charlie "only if he meets a certain price and conditions"?

997
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:07,670
我所认识的那个富有而又充满爱心的女人呢?
Where's the rich, full-hearted woman I know you to be?

998
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:18,139
我说，不要再讨价还价了，不要再提条件了，不要再提这种非此即彼的怪念头了，不要再把我们俩都勒死了。
I say no more bargains, no more conditions, no more of this either-or, neither-nor whim that strangles us both.

999
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:22,268
我说不，我说不做我们自己!
I say no, and I say down with not being what we are!

1000
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,062
你可以说话。
You can talk.

1001
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,273
你可以说话。
You can talk.

1002
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:30,776
当你是查理·凯斯时，你怎么能说话。
How you can talk when you're Charlie cass.

1003
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:35,823
我想打败你，打败你……玛丽恩，我需要你。
I'd like to beat you, beat you... Marion, I need you.

1004
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,578
我爱你。
I love you.

1005
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:48,377
我保证理解你，奉献你，尽我所能。
I promise you understanding, devofion, anything I can give you.

1006
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,881
听着，如果你离开我，祝你好运。
Listen, if you leave me, cross your fingers as you go.

1007
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,675
事实上，为我祈祷吧。
In fact, pray for me.

1008
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,055
但如果你留下来，就得是真的。
But if you stay, it's got to be real.

1009
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,599
你不能再伸手去拿门把手了。
You've got to stop reaching for that doorknob.

1010
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:05,770
你要爱我胜过爱你自己。
You've got to love me that much more than you do yourself.

1011
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,132
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1012
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,719
查理……
Charlie...

1013
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,225
帮我个忙，好吗?
Do me a favor, will you?

1014
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,894
趁还来得及，赶紧长大吧。
Grow up before it's too late.

1015
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,409
再来一次，查理。
Just one more shot, Charlie.

1016
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,706
-马上就来，汉库斯。——好的。
- Be with you in a minute, hankus. - All right.

1017
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:12,044
——是的!谢谢你,查理。-谢谢，亲爱的。
- Yeah! Thanks, Charlie. - Thank you, honey.

1018
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:18,425
所以你要离开我们所有人。回去写伟大的美国小说吗?
So you're leaving us all. Going back to write the great American novel?

1019
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,719
好莱坞的损失，纽约的收获。
Hollywood's loss, New York's gain.

1020
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:22,721
幸运的人。我有点羡慕你，汉克。
Lucky guy. I kind of envy you, Hank.

1021
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:25,641
好吧，还有时间。局长是个大人物。
Well, there's still time. The chief's a big train.

1022
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,269
要我帮你预订吗?
You want me to make reservations for you?

1023
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,273
-这本书是关于什么的?——一个人。一个普通的人。
- What's the book is going to be about? - A man. An average man.

1024
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:35,818
-一个非常像你的人。-是的，很普通。
- A man very much like you. - Yes, that's very average.

1025
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:41,866
那么，一个人如何能成为一个受欢迎的电影明星，而不以某种方式反映平均水平呢?
Now, how could a man become a popular movie star without reflecting the average in one way or another?

1026
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,660
真的是关于像我这样的人吗?
Is it really about a guy like me?

1027
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,790
这是一个关于道德价值的寓言。
It's a fable, about moral values.

1028
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,209
成功,幸福。
Success, happiness.

1029
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:56,839
你觉得玛丽安在这里不会开心的，是吗?
You don't think Marion is going to be happy here, do you?

1030
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,924
不，我觉得她不会高兴的。
No, I don't think she's going to be happy.

1031
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,467
为什么不呢?
Why not?

1032
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:04,263
因为你是个理想主义者，查理，你出卖了自己。
Because you were an idealist, Charlie, and you sold out.

1033
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:09,059
你加入了hoff, coy & company，这让你变成了半个理想主义者。
You joined hoff, coy & company, and that left you half an idealist.

1034
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:13,689
这世上没有比这更折磨人的了，无论是鱼还是鸟。
There's nothing more tortured on the face of this earth, neither fish nor fowl.

1035
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:17,359
一个出卖了自己梦想的人，却无法忘记。
A man who's sold out his dreams, but he can't forget.

1036
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:21,614
是啊，但这是有原因的，你没有掌握所有的事实。
Yeah, but there are reasons, pal. You don't have all the facts.

1037
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,743
一个爱尔兰人写道:“我想我曾经把它送给过你，这是易卜生主义的精髓。”
An irishman wrote, I think I sent it to you once, the quintessence of ibsenism.

1038
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,953
他说有三种人。
He said that there are three kinds of men.

1039
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:31,832
首先,现实主义者。现在,忸怩作态。他和魔鬼做了交易。
First, the realist. Now, that's coy. He's made his deal with the devil.

1040
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,876
他也不会有什么不同。
He wouldn't be any different.

1041
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:39,089
还有个庸俗的人，像霍夫，跟他没什么不同。
Then there's the philistine, like hoff, who couldn't be any different.

1042
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:43,427
但事实就是如此。他们有自己的正直，他们是清廉的。
But they are what they are. They have their own integrity, they're incorruptible.

1043
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,472
然后是第三种，理想主义者。
Then there's the third kind, the idealist.

1044
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,724
这是你的。
That was you.

1045
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:52,436
查理，半理想主义是灵魂的腹膜炎。
Half-idealism, Charlie, is the peritonitis of the soul.

1046
01:18:56,941 --> 01:19:00,236
去写你的书吧，汉克。可耻的。
Go write your book, Hank. Make it scandalous.

1047
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:03,155
你需要钱时随时给我电汇。
Wire me for money anytime you need it.

1048
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,450
有人必须完成他生来就该做的工作。
Somebody has to complete the work he was born to do.

1049
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,623
-我太天真了，不是吗?-是的，但这是你最好的品质之一。
- Naive, ain't I? - Yes, but it's one of your best qualities.

1050
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,461
“灵魂腹膜炎。”这些都是你在地面上使用的词。
"Peritonitis of the soul." Those are the words you use above ground.

1051
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,299
再见,汉克。
Goodbye, Hank.

1052
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,842
再见,查理。
Goodbye, Charlie.

1053
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,346
奋斗，你仍可能赢得祝福。
Struggle, you may still win a blessing.

1054
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:40,359
- Coy先生，他一直在等你。-谢谢你，拉塞尔。
- Mr. Coy, he's been waiting for you. - Thank you, Russell.

1055
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:45,906
嘿，凯蒂，怎么了?
Hey, kitty, what's up?

1056
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,784
你在哪里?我到处找你。
Where you been? I've been looking everywhere for you.

1057
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,786
奇怪的是，我去过演播室。
Oddly enough, I've been at the studio.

1058
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:54,081
一些剧照，我想和一位作家朋友说再见。
Some stills, and I wanted to say goodbye to a writer friend.

1059
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,125
——绞盘机?-是的。
- Teagle? - Yeah.

1060
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,254
我以为他回纽约了。我在想他的名字。
I thought he went back to New York. I'm trying to remember his first name.

1061
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:01,880
荷瑞修。
Horatio.

1062
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:05,217
-他为我们写过什么?-屏幕上什么都没有。
- What did he ever write for us? - Nothing that got on the screen.

1063
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,762
斯坦利永远不明白他的剧本是关于什么的。
Stanley could never understand what his scripts were about.

1064
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,893
查理，有事情发生了，很热的事情。
Charlie, something's come up, something hot.

1065
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:18,605
-我告诉纳特我不会去演那个音乐剧的!-和音乐剧无关。
- I told nat I wouldn't do that musical! - Nothing to do with the musical.

1066
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,275
斯坦利对迪克西·埃文斯大发雷霆。
Stanley blew his top with Dixie Evans.

1067
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,236
他请她今天下午来谈一谈。
He asked her to come in this afternoon and have a talk.

1068
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:28,741
她迟到了一个小时，喝得醉醺醺的，还用皮带牵着一条狗。
She showed up one hour late, drunk, lugging a dog on a leash.

1069
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,743
贵宾犬吗?
A poodle?

1070
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:34,705
情况已经够严重了，史丹利忍住了怒气。
The situation being serious enough, Stanley kept his temper.

1071
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,751
他像父亲一样对她说话。他说……让我告诉你他说了什么。
He talked to her like a father. He said... Let me tell you what he said.

1072
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,919
他告诉她他在贝永擦皮鞋的日子。
He told her about his bootblack days in bayonne.

1073
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:47,426
然后，他轻轻地哼了一声“心神不安”的曲子，然后，在你还不知道发生了什么事之前，他已经泪流满面了。
Then he chimed softly the "uneasy lies the head" routine, then, before you knew what was happening, he made with the tears.

1074
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:52,097
-然后呢?-她当面嘲笑他。
- Then what happened? - She laughed in his face.

1075
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,475
告诉他全镇的人都知道他哭了。
Told him the whole town knew about his crying.

1076
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,102
是时候改弦更张了。
It was time to change the act.

1077
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,480
他打她吗?
He hit her?

1078
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,441
把她打倒在地，踢得青一块紫一块。
Knocked her down and kicked her black and blue.

1079
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:08,238
可能断了一根肋骨。他们把她绑在医务室里。
May have broken one of her ribs. They taped her up in the infirmary.

1080
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:16,455
我们的故事是，那只大怪物之一的狗，猛地一拉皮带，把她扔在地上。
Our story is that the dog, one of those great big monsters, yanked on the leash and threw her to the floor.

1081
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:23,504
她知道她没法让袭击的故事站得住脚，但是…她说她准备把你的故事告诉媒体。
She knows she can't make an assault story stick, but... She says she's ready to spill your story to the press.

1082
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,631
尤其是帕蒂本笃。
Particularly Patty Benedict.

1083
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:29,802
这就是爱，这就是爱，我
.I that's love, that's love...I

1084
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:38,185
-她在哪儿?-施瓦布对面的酒吧。
- Where is she? - That bar across from schwab's.

1085
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,896
一个女人喝六杯马提尼酒能毁了一座城市。
A woman with six martinis can ruin a city.

1086
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,277
-你在笑什么?-我在笑吗?
- What are you smiling about? - Am I smiling?

1087
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,785
嗯…我们的下一个议程是什么?
Well... what's next on our sordid agenda?

1088
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,371
得有人给马装上马鞍。
Somebody's got to saddle the horse.

1089
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,542
快过去把她带出酒吧。
Get over there and get her out of that bar.

1090
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,252
-带她去哪里?——她的公寓。
- Get her to where? - Her apartment.

1091
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:06,046
——为什么是我?-你是她唯一的舞伴。
- Why me? - You're the only one she'll go with.

1092
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,840
别担心电话。
Don't worry about the telephone.

1093
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,843
我们已经处理好了。这是拽。
We've taken care of that. It's been yanked.

1094
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,762
喂她一些马提尼酒。那会让她安静下来的。
Feed her some martinis. That'll keep her quiet.

1095
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:19,810
-如果他们没有呢?——他们会。杜松子酒的窜改。
- Suppose they don't? - They will. The gin's doctored.

1096
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,990
好了，她躺在地板上。现在我该怎么办?
Okay, she's on the floor. Now what do I do?

1097
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:36,702
等她晕过去就离开。从那一刻起，你就清白了。
Leave the minute she passes out. From that moment on, you're in the clear.

1098
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,579
回演播室报到。
Report back to the studio.

1099
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,915
你一整天都在做宣传照。
You've been there all day long making publicity stills.

1100
01:22:53,802 --> 01:23:00,809
笑脸……你的话里有毛。你脑子里全是虱子。
Smiley... Your words have hair on them. Your brain is full of lice.

1101
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,604
相信我,查理。没时间了。
Trust me, Charlie. There's no time to lose.

1102
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,397
只要记住一件事。
Just bear in mind one thing.

1103
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:10,944
你第一次策划的那天，你就把策划和策划的孩子们结合起来。
The day you first scheme, you marry that scheme and the scheme's children.

1104
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:15,657
这一分钟你想要的一切都取决于荡妇肚子里的几杯酒。
Everything you want this minute depends on a few drinks in a trollop's guts.

1105
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:20,120
你觉得她是什么人?飞蛾? 虫子？
What do you think she is? A moth? A bug?

1106
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:23,874
说话轻松。保持灵活,基蒂。
Speak easy. Keep flexible, kitty.

1107
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,462
这周末她就会被遗忘。
She'll go unremembered by the end of the week.

1108
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,675
——斯坦利在哪儿?-他不知道这件事
- Where's Stanley? - He doesn't know about this.

1109
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,638
那我们就得告诉他，对吧?你去找他，斯迈利。我要回去了。
Then we'll have to tell him, won't we? You find him, smiley. I'll get back nat.

1110
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,598
没有理由让他们参与进来。
There's no reason for them to be involved.

1111
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,227
但我有足够的理由比以前更深入地参与进来?
But there's plenty of reason for me to be involved even deeper than before?

1112
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:46,855
我不会那么做的，凯蒂。别再提高嗓门了。
I wouldn't do that, kitty. And don't raise your voice again.

1113
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,649
你不记得了吗?
Don't you remember?

1114
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,443
我是“抱着渺茫希望的武士吟游诗人”。
I'm the "warrior minstrel with the forlorn hope".

1115
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:58,492
-对不起，我不是故意打扰你的。-没事的。
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. - It's all right.

1116
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,536
——你好,马里昂。——你好,笑脸。
- Hello, Marion. - Hello, smiley.

1117
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:03,038
我去厨房拿外套。
I'll get my coat from the kitchen.

1118
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,876
-她在这里做什么?——廉价农奴劳动力。
- What's she doing here? - Cheap serf labor.

1119
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,837
-我付她一辈子的钱。-那天晚上你们分居了
- I pay her by the lifetime. - You were separated the other night.

1120
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:14,007
我等待。拿着图书馆的电话，把那个催泪器拿来。
I'm waiting. Take that library phone and get that weeper here.

1121
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:17,052
好吧。如果我不能指望你，我就自己处理。
Okay. If I can't count on you, I'll handle this myself.

1122
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:21,306
哦,不。谋杀是不可分割的。我发现了，就像贞操一样。
Oh, no. Murder is indivisible. I'm finding that out, like chastity.

1123
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,031
没有小量这回事。我也在寻找答案。
There's no such thing as a small amount. I'm finding that out too.

1124
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,688
-别吹你的假发，学者-给我接通斯坦利·霍夫!
- Don't blow your wig, scholar. - Get me Stanley hoff!

1125
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:31,900
-好吧，我自己来。-别孩子气了，查理。
- All right, I'll do it myself. - Don't be boyish, Charlie.

1126
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:34,185
你觉得你能把斯坦利牵扯进来吗?
You think you can involve Stanley in a thing like this?

1127
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:38,407
-他已经忙得不可开交了。——证明了这一点。试着证明它。
- He's already involved up to his neck. - Prove it. Try and prove it.

1128
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:42,786
为了你自己，这不关别人的事，甚至不关你妻子的事。
For your own sake, this is nobody else's business, not even your wife's.

1129
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:45,330
马里恩!马里恩!
Marion! Marion!

1130
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:48,208
Smiley coy有话要跟你说!
Smiley coy wants to tell you something!

1131
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,752
凯蒂，我觉得你真的心动了。
Kitty, I think you've really flipped.

1132
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:56,049
-玛丽恩，查理喝醉了。-继续，告诉她，笑嘻嘻。
- Marion, Charlie's drunk. - Go on, tell her, smiley.

1133
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,968
去告诉她吧!
Go ahead and tell her!

1134
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,138
凯蒂，别那么急躁。小心你的步骤。
Now, don't be impetuous, kitty. Watch your step.

1135
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:04,808
查理今天还没清醒到讨论剧本的程度。
Charlie's not sober enough to discuss the script today.

1136
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,977
我掌握了一些事实。
I have certain facts in my hands.

1137
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:10,397
如果他们被炸飞了，我就只剩下流血的残肢而不是手。
If they blow up, I've got bleeding stumps left not hands.

1138
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,608
但你也要去。
But you'll go, too.

1139
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,776
我是查理·卡塞尔，斯坦利·霍夫。
This is Charlie castle for Stanley hoff.

1140
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:17,821
-查理，怎么了?-你会告诉她吗?
- Charlie, what is it? - Are you going to tell her?

1141
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:21,700
玛丽安，查理对他的朋友有很多幻想。
Marion, Charlie gets fanciful ideas about his friend.

1142
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:30,542
他实际上是在指控我密谋谋杀一个录音室的小演员那个人在事故当晚和他一起在车里。
He's actually accusing me of plotting the murder of a little studio bit player who was with him in the car the night of the accident.

1143
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,339
玛丽恩，我稍后再解释。
I'll explain later, Marion.

1144
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:38,925
请拿着图书馆的电话，马上把纳特叫来。
Please, take the library phone and get nat here right away.

1145
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,640
也许你知道自己在做什么。
Maybe you know what you're doing.

1146
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,893
-我想我会等。-我知道你会等的。
- I think I'll wait. - I know you'll wait.

1147
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,062
你会等啊等啊等。
You'll wait and wait and wait.

1148
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:55,275
-你对待你的朋友很糟糕，凯蒂。-你不是我的朋友。
- You mishandle your friends, kitty. - You're not my friend.

1149
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,861
那个可怜的小女孩是我的朋友。
That pathetic little girl is my friend.

1150
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:03,909
——莉莉?霍夫叔叔，请说。你能马上过来吗?
- Lily? Uncle hoff, if you please. - Could you come over right away?

1151
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:10,582
我知道我不只是在表达我的观点，也是你的观点。
I know I'm not only expressing my views, but yours as well.

1152
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:17,881
至于你关于暴力和犯罪的含笑的想法，我对你的想法很尊重，但我不相信。
As for your idea that smiley coy thought in terms of violence and crime, with all due respect to what you thought, I can't give it credence.

1153
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:21,218
你是说笑脸什么都没告诉我。我只是凭空想象出来的。
You're saying smiley didn't tell me anything. I just dreamed it up.

1154
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:25,263
我不会说你白天做梦，但喝了几杯之后，这可能吗?
I wouldn't say you dream by day, but after a few drinks, isn't it possible?

1155
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,808
什么是可能的，这正是我所说的。
What is possible is exactly what I said.

1156
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:31,395
-让我把我的想法讲清楚。-不要把他们围起来。
- Let me round out my thoughts. - Don't round them out.

1157
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,355
-我可以继续…-我不希望你这么做
- I may continue... - I don't want you to.

1158
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:39,319
你永远不会被告知，你演讲时的刺绣与你要说的任何话完全不成比例。
You're never told, the embroidery of your speech is completely out of proportion to anything you have to say.

1159
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,029
好吧。
All right.

1160
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,410
我在听。
I'm listening.

1161
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:50,330
你有什么要说的?
What do you have to say?

1162
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:54,292
他一小时前来过这里。他说有麻烦了。
He came here one hour ago. He said there was trouble.

1163
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:57,671
-然后他提议我…——他没有提出这类建议!
- He then proposed that I... - He proposed nothing of the sort!

1164
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:06,680
说一个人喜欢微笑忸怩，一个前美国陆军空军少校，朋友很多，我不知道从哪里开始，已故了!乔尔森，杰罗姆·科恩，比尔·欧德怀尔。
To say a man like smiley coy, a former major in the us army air force, a friend of many, I don't know where to begin, the late a! Jolson, Jerome kern, bill o'dwyer.

1165
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:10,100
说这个人策划谋杀是荒唐的。
To say that this man plotted murder is to stagger reason.

1166
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,145
你在浪费宝贵的时间。
You're wasting valuable time.

1167
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,272
斯坦利，你完全正确。
Stanley, you're 1,000% right.

1168
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:18,358
肺炎就要来了，而我们说的是头痛。
Pneumonia is at the door, and we are talking about a headache.

1169
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,860
如果你处在我的位置，你会怎么做?
What would you do in my place?

1170
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,612
我们得说服这个女孩不要说话。
We have to convince this girl not to talk.

1171
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:26,450
我同意，但你不能让我束手束脚地去打仗。
I agree with you, but you can't ask me to go into battle with my hands tied.

1172
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,326
我一直是个简单的人。
I've always been a simple man.

1173
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:31,455
我的早餐仍然是面包、黄油和一杯咖啡。
And I still make my breakfast on a roll, butter and a cup of coffee.

1174
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:35,125
霍夫先生吗?你不能停止谈论你自己吗?
Mr. Hoff? Can't you stop talking about yourself?

1175
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,799
为什么这个女人一定要在这里?
Why does the woman have to be here?

1176
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,761
这位女士。
The lady stays.

1177
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:51,224
斯坦利，我想亲自去找这个女孩像父亲一样和她说话。
Stanley, I want to go to this girl myself and talk to her like a father.

1178
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:55,437
看看能不能从我的口袋里拿出一些可行的现金。
See if we can't work out some feasible cash offer out of my own pocket.

1179
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,731
我们可以折中一下。-太迟了。
- We could split the difference. - It's too late.

1180
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,901
这个女孩缺乏基本的教育和理解。
This girl is without the fundamentals of an education and understanding.

1181
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:06,281
花几美元割掉我们的鼻子，咬我们的脸，会有多大比例?
What is the percentage for a few dollars to cutoff our nose and bite our face?

1182
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,575
我说不，就是不。
When I say no, I mean no.

1183
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,077
这镇上有几个人发现了这一点。
There are a few people in this town who've found that out.

1184
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,580
-但女孩必须…-好的，非常感谢。
- But the girl must... - All right, thank you very much.

1185
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:18,627
等一下。斯迈利对着那个假的锡喇叭说了什么?
Wait a minute. What did smiley whisper into that phony tin trumpet?

1186
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:22,214
你告诉他们，微笑的。
You tell them, smiley.

1187
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:25,425
她还在酒吧，我的一个朋友在招待她。
That she's still at the bar, being entertained by a friend of mine.

1188
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:30,138
-如果她有什么不测…-你在卖刚放了四天的鱼，凯蒂。
- If anything happens to her... - You're selling fish four days old, kitty.

1189
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:33,308
她和蒙提·里兹在一起。他也是个阴谋家吗?
She's with monty ritz. Is he a conspirator, too?

1190
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:37,145
为什么不呢?据我所知，你也可以敲诈蒙蒂。
Why not? For all I know, you could have some blackmail on monty, too.

1191
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,564
我们说的是谋杀。
We're talking about murder.

1192
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,319
你的客户必须学会说话。
Your client has to learn how to talk.

1193
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,905
我们知道谁是谋杀方面的专家。
We know who the expert is when it comes to murder.

1194
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,908
像你这样的男孩?你是谁?
A boy like you? Who are you?

1195
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:56,665
你是谁?某种特殊的贵族阶级就因为女性公众想和你做爱?
Who are you? Some kind of special aristocracy because the female public wants to make love with you?

1196
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:00,377
你是谁，你的指甲又脏又乱?
Who are you, with your dirty, unmanicured fingernails?

1197
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:05,131
没有霍夫联盟的支持，你算什么?
And what are you without hoff-federated behind you?

1198
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:09,928
工作室是我建的!我，用我的脑子和我的手!
I built the studio! I, with my brain and my hand!

1199
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:13,348
我用我的大脑和双手把它从世界上夺走了!
I ripped it out of the world with my brains and my hands!

1200
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:16,476
-你是谁?-不，必须停止!
- And who are you? - No, this must stop!

1201
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,770
我为什么要听这个可怜的孩子的?
Why do I have to listen to this miserable boy?

1202
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,107
像我这样的人，与总统和国王共进晚餐?
A man like myself, who's wined and dined with presidents and kings?

1203
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:26,570
-噢，我的背好疼!-我必须迎合他们吗?
- Oh, my aching back! - Do I have to cater to this?

1204
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,364
我受够了你那虚伪的议员辩才。
Well, I've had enough of your phony senatorial eloquence.

1205
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,449
我会像砍柴火一样把你砍倒。
I'll chop you down like firewood.

1206
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:34,119
不得不和你谈话，真是痛苦而又可怜的遗憾。
It is a bitter, miserable pity to have to talk to you.

1207
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,205
——就是这样。这是交易。-查理，求你了!
- That's it. That's the deal. - Charlie, I beg of you, please!

1208
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,541
我们再也不用互相说话了。
We never have to talk to each other again.

1209
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,419
小娜，你是我的经纪人。从现在开始，只有你和他。
Nat, you're my agent. From now on, it's you and him.

1210
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,088
我再也不用跟他说话了。
I never have to talk to him again.

1211
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,216
-你会开得太远的。——我要?
- You'll drive me too far. - Will I?

1212
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,343
你的沸点是多少，霍夫叔叔?
What's your boiling point, uncle hoff?

1213
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:53,972
别生气，别表现得无聊，也别哭。
Well, don't sulk, don't act bored, and please don't cry.

1214
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:55,682
查理，求你了。
Charlie, I beg of you, please.

1215
01:29:55,807 --> 01:30:04,733
我是在故意伤害你的自尊心，斯坦利，因为今天我看到斯坦利·施莱纳霍夫会怎么做来保护一项投资:谋杀。
I'm deliberately tampering with your modest ego, Stanley, because today I see what Stanley shriner hoff would do to protect an investment: Murder.

1216
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:07,944
这个人埋头苦干。
This man buries himself with his mouth.

1217
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,530
看着他。让他的行动。
Look at him. Get his act.

1218
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,407
他想扮演鳄鱼。
He's trying to play the crocodile.

1219
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:15,785
他是什么人?岩石下的一只小蜥蜴。
And what is he? A little lizard under a rock.

1220
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:21,416
斯迈利，明天早上和法务部开会仔细审查一下castle的合同，给我找个空缺!
Smiley, get together with the legal department in the morning and comb through the castle contract and find me an opening!

1221
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:26,129
斯坦利……我想还有一个解决办法。
Stanley... I think there's one other solution.

1222
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:29,799
是的，它来了，花招，扭转，古老的突变。
Yes, here it comes, the gimmick, the twist, the old switcheroo.

1223
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,928
宝贝，事情总会有转机的。他们总是成对工作。
There's always a twist, sweetie. They always work in pairs.

1224
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,639
迪克西的问题有个角度。
There's an angle to this Dixie problem.

1225
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:38,850
-马里恩，这取决于你。——什么?
- Marion, it depends upon you. - What?

1226
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:43,146
你和查理在过去的两年里分居了三次。
You and Charlie have been separated three times in the last two years.

1227
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,357
你爱他爱到可以做出牺牲吗?
Do you love him enough to make a sacrifice?

1228
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,068
-我爱他吗?-让他说完，亲爱的。
- Do I love him? - Let him finish, dear.

1229
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:52,989
迪克西马上就会嫁给查理。那将是她所有梦想的实现。
Dixie would marry Charlie in a minute. It'd be the fulfilment of all her dreams.

1230
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:56,076
夫妻共同财产法会自动照顾你。
Community property laws automatically take care of you.

1231
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,328
查理拥有的东西有一半是你的。
Half of everything Charlie owns belongs to you.

1232
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,747
先生们，我真不敢相信我的耳朵!
Gentlemen, I can't believe my ears!

1233
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:05,627
让他说完，然后你再去做跟你无关的事，娜特。
Let him finish before you jump in where it doesn't concern you, nat.

1234
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:10,256
这个女人最近和我们在片场认识的一个作家有关系。
This woman has been having to do with a writer we had on the lot recently.

1235
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:11,549
那不是真的。
That isn't true.

1236
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,969
他们偶尔也会有关系。
From time to time, they had relations.

1237
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:17,597
-那不是真的!-我来处理。
- Thatjust isn't true! - Let me handle this.

1238
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:22,435
-当然，你有证据。——记录。
- Of course, you have proof. - Records.

1239
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:27,065
你有我和蒂格尔先生在他办公室的谈话记录吗?
You have records of conversations I've had with Mr. Teagle in his office?

1240
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:31,403
还有他办公室和沙发上的录音。
And tape recordings in his office and on his couch.

1241
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,198
是谁下令录制这些录音的?
Who ordered such recordings to be made?

1242
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,325
我不能说。那不是我能控制的。
I couldn't say. That's out of my hands.

1243
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,286
-他们在哪里?-在我车里。
- Where are they? - In my car.

1244
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:43,623
让他们。
Get them.

1245
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,459
让他们微笑。
Get them, smiley.

1246
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,047
让他们。
Get them.

1247
01:31:56,219 --> 01:32:00,849
“互谅互让”一直是我的座右铭，马里昂。
"Live and let live" has always been an important motto with me, Marion.

1248
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:05,895
我并不是针对你个人，你明白的。
I have nothing against you personally, you understand.

1249
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:09,607
但有时，为了公司的利益，我被迫有点粗暴。
But sometimes, for the good of the company, I'm forced to play a little rough.

1250
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:11,568
Nat，来点苏打水。
Nat, a little sparkling water.

1251
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,995
好吧。好吧!
All right. All right!

1252
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:31,171
我的职业生涯结束了，我愿意，也就是说因为你是世界上最卑鄙，最肮脏的混蛋!
My career is finished, and I'm willing, namely because you're the meanest, dirtiest skunk god ever put breath into!

1253
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:40,930
这位是霍夫先生，我跪下来感谢上帝让我不用再和他打球了!
This is Mr. Hoff, a man that I fall down on my knees and thank my maker that I don't have to play ball with him anymore!

1254
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:46,269
不好意思，查理，我哭了。
Excuse me, Charlie, that I'm crying.

1255
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,817
别担心,马里昂。
Don't worry, Marion.

1256
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:54,360
别担心,查理。
Don't worry, Charlie.

1257
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:59,032
在我给你找麻烦之前，我先把自己的脑袋放到铁轨上。
Before I'll get you in trouble, I'll put my own head on the railroad tracks.

1258
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:13,296
查理……那些记录没什么好辩护的。
Charlie... There's nothing to defend about those records.

1259
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,027
这是晚了。
It's late.

1260
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:38,905
你们就不回家吃晚饭吗?
Don't you boys ever go home to dinner?

1261
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,407
这样做。
Do that.

1262
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,619
帮我个忙吧，smiley。带霍夫回家。
Do that for me, smiley. Take hoff home.

1263
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,621
把他弄出去。
Get him out of here.

1264
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,711
保持!
Stay!

1265
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:00,093
哦，你真幸运。
Oh, you're so lucky.

1266
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:04,556
如果这是一部电影，你会在地板上躺十次。
If this were a movie, you'd have been on the floor 10 times.

1267
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,647
只是个小礼物。
Just a small token.

1268
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,068
我会打破你的。
I'll break you.

1269
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,779
我会把你打碎，就像…
I'll break you like a...

1270
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:31,124
不，不，我让法律替我解决。
No, no, I'll let the law do it for me.

1271
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:35,003
这次我让法律替我处理，你会失去一切。
I'll let the law do it for me this time, and you lose everything.

1272
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:40,758
你失去了一切。这是一桩丑闻，一场灾难，一场毁灭。
You lose everything. This is a scandal and a disaster and a ruin.

1273
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:46,181
死去孩子的家人和保险公司会在任何法庭上从你身上拿走一切。
The dead child's family and the insurance company will take everything off your back in any court in the land.

1274
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:49,517
脱掉你的衣服，脱掉你孩子的衣服，脱掉那个女人的衣服。
The clothes off your back, off your child, and off that woman.

1275
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:51,561
一切都,查理。
Everything goes, Charlie.

1276
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:56,900
一切都没了，房子没了，画没了，还有你!
Everything goes, the house goes, the paintings go, and you!

1277
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,651
哦,你走吧!
Oh, you go!

1278
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,113
哦,不,查尔斯。
Oh, no, Charles.

1279
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:05,116
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1280
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:08,244
你今天抛弃了一个王国。
You threw away a kingdom today.

1281
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,753
好吗?
Well?

1282
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:21,299
——继续。——再见,基蒂。
- Go on. - Goodbye, kitty.

1283
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,843
我就把你丢给狼和刀子了。
I'll leave you to the wolves and the knives.

1284
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:27,639
你不再有我和录音室帮你应付媒体了。
You no longer have me and the studio to handle the press for you.

1285
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,265
你通过。
You're through.

1286
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:34,187
我说的还在继续。如果她有什么不测…制片厂对那个女孩不再感兴趣了。
What I said still goes. If anything happens to her... The studio has no further interest in that girl.

1287
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,150
所有的安静。
All quiet.

1288
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,861
我需要补药。
I need a tonic.

1289
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,204
——你会叫吗?——是的。
- You'll call? - Yes.

1290
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:58,294
-你确定?-是的，我确定。
- You're sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

1291
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:17,313
我为什么要给这个怪诞而忠诚的灵魂加上这个负担呢?
Why did I add this burden to that grotesque, devoted soul?

1292
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:23,111
你注意到他读书的时候会动嘴唇吗?
Did you ever notice he moves his lips when he reads?

1293
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,614
亲爱的,这是尼基。
Darling, here's Nicky.

1294
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:30,201
嗯，你觉得怎么样?要我给你拿点什么吗?
Well, what do you say? Can I get you something?

1295
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,078
马里恩?查理?
Marion? Charlie?

1296
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:36,207
是的,尼克。
Yeah, nicko.

1297
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:41,754
帮我洗个澡。
Go run a bath for me.

1298
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:44,424
好,热。我的背很僵。
Good and hot. My back is stiff.

1299
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,926
别担心，我会处理好的。
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

1300
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:54,225
-你和汉克之间的事…-不，亲爱的，我没有
- That thing between you and Hank... - No, darling, I didn't.

1301
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,686
现在,不要解释。我相信你。
Now, don't explain. I believe you.

1302
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,441
看出汗。
Look how sweaty.

1303
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,445
我的手。
My hands.

1304
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:10,616
过来,天使。坐在这里。
Come here, angel. Sit here.

1305
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,251
好吗?
Well?

1306
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,630
你觉得今天怎么样?
What do you think of today?

1307
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:27,008
我能列出所有可能的道路吗?
Think I can list all the possible roads ahead?

1308
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:31,220
不用麻烦了。我们不能让那女孩闭嘴。这已经成为她人生的事业。
Don't bother. We won't silence that girl. It's become the cause of her life.

1309
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,976
你看，每个人都需要一个成就伟大的理由。
You see, everyone needs a cause to touch greatness.

1310
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,230
汉克明天才走。
Hank doesn't leave until tomorrow.

1311
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:45,360
-你跟他说过这些吗?——没有。
- Did you ever tell him about all this? - No.

1312
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:51,491
为什么不叫他过来?汉克知道怎么修理。
Why don't we call him over? Hank knows how to fix.

1313
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,912
好吧。
All right.

1314
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,264
你好,汉克吗?
Hello, Hank?

1315
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,309
亲爱的，你能马上过来一下吗?
Look, dear, could you come over here right away?

1316
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:21,104
是的，我们有件事需要你的建议。
Yes, we need your advice about something.

1317
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,523
是的，这很重要。
Yes, it's very important.

1318
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:26,901
“遥远的时代是寒冷和孤独的。
"The times beyond are cold and lonely.

1319
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,863
“像星星一样遥远。”
"Far away as the stars."

1320
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:35,868
但我们有两个人。
But there were two of us.

1321
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:43,418
比利不能长大成为富翁的儿子。
Billy mustn't grow up to be a rich man's son.

1322
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:48,047
——他不会。它们通常是用海绵蛋糕做的。
- He won't. - They're usually made of sponge cake.

1323
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,174
但他不会。
But he won't be.

1324
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:58,891
你教会了我很多东西，亲爱的，甚至包括如何听音乐。
You taught me so many things, darling, even how to listen to music.

1325
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:04,397
-放点音乐。——好的。
- Play some music. - All right.

1326
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:09,402
-你想听什么?——不朽的东西。
- What would you like to hear? - Something immortal.

1327
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,989
我不知道，机器上的东西都行。
I don't know, anything that's on the machine.

1328
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:22,373
“我永远不会离开他，汉克。
'I'ii never leave him, Hank.

1329
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:25,877
“这不仅是因为我是一个守旧派的妻子。
'It's not just that I'm a wife of the old-fashioned school.

1330
01:39:26,002 --> 01:39:28,963
“我是他生活的一部分。
'I'm so deeply a part of his existence.

1331
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:32,550
不管我离开多少次，我总是要回去。
'No matter how many times I leave, I always go back.

1332
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:34,760
“他是我的一部分。
'He's part of me.

1333
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:39,015
“他对我做的最可怕的事也比没有他强。”
'The most terrible things he can do to me are better than not having him.'

1334
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:03,039
这不是我想听到的。
It wasn't what I expected to hear.

1335
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:21,557
-这里天黑了吗?-是的，亲爱的。
- Is it getting dark in here? - Yes, darling, it is.

1336
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,726
我去开灯。
I'll turn on the lights.

1337
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:30,816
你好,朋友。
Hello, buddy.

1338
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:34,695
你好,朋友。
Hiya, buddy.

1339
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,620
-怎么了，孩子?-你是我的朋友。
- What's the matter, kid? - You were my friend.

1340
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:45,414
你是我的朋友。
You were my friend.

1341
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,251
我知道她是什么人。
I knew what she was.

1342
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:50,586
每次都让我伤心欲绝。
Tore the heart out of me every time it happened.

1343
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:53,005
你是我的朋友。
You were my friend.

1344
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:56,008
你怎么能……你怎么能这样做呢?
How could you... How could you do it?

1345
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,888
你想打我?
You wanna hit me?

1346
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,101
请打我。
Please, hit me.

1347
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,564
我知道你比我好。
I know you're a better man than I am.

1348
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:13,067
我是说，你是个好人，查尔斯。
I mean, such a swell guy you were, Charles.

1349
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:16,070
我一直很尊敬你。
I always looked up to you.

1350
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:21,158
但她告诉我的时候，当着我的面笑了。
But when she told me, she laughed in my face.

1351
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:27,707
这就是我辞职的原因。
That's how I resign.

1352
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,152
C.u.f. Castle.

1353
01:41:57,903 --> 01:42:01,741
他谋杀了卡斯。我在那里。我看见他做了。
He murdered cass. I was there. I saw him do it.

1354
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:05,411
查理，浴缸快满了。
Charlie, the bathtub's almost full.

1355
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:09,373
楼上的大毛巾用完了，我去小屋拿些来。
I run out of big towels upstairs, so I'll get some from the cabana.

1356
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:23,554
你知道吗，在我的一生中，我一直渴望人们能激发出我最好的一面。
Did you ever know that all my life I've yearned for people to bring out the best in me.

1357
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:27,183
马里昂。
Marion.

1358
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:37,818
这一切使你感到痛苦。
All that embittered you.

1359
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,822
我保证给你一个更美好的未来。
I pledge you a better future.

1360
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:03,552
马里恩?
Marion?

1361
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:12,853
今天我告诉过你我有多爱你吗?
Have I told you today how much I love you?

1362
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:15,356
我爱你。
I love you.

1363
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,317
我对你承诺过。
And I'm committed to you.

1364
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,653
我们不谈过去的事。
We won't talk about the past.

1365
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,047
你的电话，卡塞尔夫人。
Telephone for you, Mrs. Castle.

1366
01:43:40,172 --> 01:43:43,050
-是比利，他从斯蒂文斯家打来的。-谢谢你，拉塞尔。
- It's Billy, he's calling from the Stevens'. - Thank you, Russell.

1367
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:45,177
我们有四个人。做一顿简单的晚餐。
There'll be four of us. Make a light supper.

1368
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:46,929
简单的四人晚餐，好吧。
Light supper for four, right.

1369
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:50,057
任何东西上都不要放欧芹。卡塞尔先生不喜欢。
And no parsley on anything. Mr. Castle doesn't like it.

1370
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,600
正确的。
Right.

1371
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:58,149
你好,亲爱的。你好吗?
Hello, darling. How are you?

1372
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:03,237
可怜的牛仔们，真可惜。
Poor cowboys, what a shame.

1373
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:07,658
你为什么不回击他呢?
Why don't you hit him back?

1374
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:13,080
不，等一下，比利，我错了。不要还手。
No, wait a minute, Billy, I was wrong. Don't hit him back.

1375
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:18,210
跟他解释，因为他比你高大，这不公平。
Explain to him that, since he's bigger than you, it isn't fair.

1376
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:22,715
当然，明天午饭后我来接你。
Sure, I'll pick you up after lunch tomorrow.

1377
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,092
现在，别忘了刷牙。
Now, don't forget to brush your teeth.

1378
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,887
晚安,亲爱的。
Good night, darling.

1379
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,722
我自己进来的。
I just let myself in.

1380
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:33,392
今天下午发生的事我很抱歉，玛丽安。深感抱歉。
I'm sorry about what happened here this afternoon, Marion. Deeply sorry.

1381
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:38,063
我可以借用您的电话吗?别走，你会对我要说的话感兴趣的。
May I use your phone? Don't go, you'll be interested in what I've got to say.

1382
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:42,026
霍夫先生是个非常自负的人。我们有时得迎合他们。
Mr. Hoff is a very vain man. We have to cater to that sometimes.

1383
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:45,780
莉莉，帮我接老头。这很重要。
Lily, put me through to the old man. It's important.

1384
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:48,991
——查理在哪儿?-洗澡。你想要什么?
- Where's Charlie? - Taking a bath. What do you want?

1385
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:50,826
你误解了,马里昂。
You misunderstand, Marion.

1386
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:54,288
我不过是霍夫先生的备忘录而已。
I'm nothing more than a sort of memo pad for Mr. Hoff.

1387
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:57,875
斯坦利。那女孩十分钟前离开了酒吧。
Stanley. The girl left the bar 10 minutes ago.

1388
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,628
试图穿越日落大道。
Tried to navigate across sunset boulevard.

1389
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:04,507
是啊，在回家路上的车流中。
Yeah, in all that heavy, home-going traffic.

1390
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,551
是这电影。
That's the picture.

1391
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:10,471
当场死亡。
Killed instantly.

1392
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:13,516
你觉得爱尔兰人的运气怎么样?
How do you like that for the luck of the Irish?

1393
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:16,018
我现在在用查理的电话。
I'm here using Charlie's phone now.

1394
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:18,562
好的，我马上回来。再见。
Okay, I'll be right back in. Bye.

1395
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:22,650
-马里昂，在你开口之前…-真巧啊。
- Marion, before you say anything... - What a happy coincidence.

1396
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:25,027
是一辆公共汽车撞了她。
It was a city bus that hit her.

1397
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,572
-改变了一切，不是吗?——不是吗?
- Changes everything, doesn't it? - Does it?

1398
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:31,742
斯坦利也没忘记今天下午发生的事。
Not that Stanley's forgotten what happened here this afternoon.

1399
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:35,412
我们应该安排一些道歉，当然要小心。
Some sort of an apology should be arranged, carefully, of course.

1400
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:37,164
你的头脑很冷静，能做这件事。
Yours is just the level head to do it.

1401
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:39,184
你不记得这一小时到下一小时的事吗?
Don't you have a memory from one hour to the next?

1402
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:40,835
别在我面前耍花招，玛丽安。
Don't go dramatic on me, Marion.

1403
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:44,505
七年是一段很长的时间。我们有一大堆事要做。
Seven years is a long time. We've got a long row to hoe.

1404
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:46,632
像你这样的人怎么生活?
How does someone like you live?

1405
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:50,052
今天下午，你想毁了一个比你强十倍的男人。
This afternoon, you try to ruin a man who's 10 times your better.

1406
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:55,474
当你完成之后，你就被一个连呼吸都不舒服的东西从这里带走了。
And when you were finished, you toted out of here in the footsteps of a thing not even fit to breathe.

1407
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,977
查理，那个阀门肯定有问题。
Charlie, something must be wrong with that valve.

1408
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,354
-怎么了?-那是水吗?
- What's going on? - Is that water?

1409
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:02,648
查理，我觉得是你把浴缸撞翻了。
Charlie, I think you let the tub run over.

1410
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:06,735
——查理?——尼克?
- Charlie? - Nicky?

1411
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:09,446
——查理!-整个大厅都是水。
- Charlie! - There's water all over the hall.

1412
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:12,283
他想砸浴室的门。
He's trying to break the bathroom door down.

1413
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,994
查理，开门!
Charlie, open the door!

1414
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,873
笑脸……查理!
Smiley... Charlie!

1415
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,179
把水弄掉!
Get the water off!

1416
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:38,601
马里恩?查理?
Marion? Charlie?

1417
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:40,978
拉塞尔,发生了什么事?
Russell, what's happened?

1418
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:45,441
我这辈子从没见过这么糟糕的事。
I never in my life saw anything so wrong.

1419
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:48,736
发生了什么?-我不能告诉你发生了什么。
- What's happened? - I can't tell you what happened.

1420
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:52,197
-求你了，卡塞尔夫人拜托!-别抱我!让我走!
- Please, Mrs. Castle. Please! - Don't hold me! Let me go!

1421
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,158
对不起，你不能进来。
I'm sorry, but you can't come in.

1422
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:58,245
给我接艾迪·弗莱。突破。这是smiley忸怩。
Put me through to Eddie fry. Break through. This is smiley coy.

1423
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:00,205
把插头拔了，笨蛋!
Pull the plug, stupid!

1424
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:05,502
埃迪,笑脸。现在，仔细听，我不想重复一个字。
Eddie, smiley. Now, listen carefully, I don't want to repeat a word.

1425
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:06,962
听!
Listen!

1426
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:12,092
叫上柯利医生，叫上斯坦利，马上派他们到查理·卡塞尔家来。
Get Dr. Curley, get Stanley, send them here to Charlie castle's house right away.

1427
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:14,929
你给我过来，做好你的工作。这是你的工作。
You get here, and do your work. Here's your work.

1428
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:17,681
逐字逐句记下来。
Take this down word for word.

1429
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:22,102
“查理·卡塞尔，拥有三十部霍夫联邦电影的著名明星……
"Charlie castle, renowned star of thirty hoff-federated pictures...

1430
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:36,241
“今天在贝莱尔的家中因心脏病去世，他的家在…“太平洋夏令时7:55。
"Died today of a heart attack in his bel air home at... "7:55 pacific daylight time.

1431
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:50,881

"At his bedside was his physician, Dr. Curley, "his wife, Marion, his 7-year-old son, Billy, "and his close friend and associate, Stanley shriner hoff."

1432

现在把消息发给美联社，还有其他的通讯社。
Now get that out to the ap, up, and the rest of the wire services.

1433
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:55,803
别问问题!
Don't ask questions!

1434
01:47:55,928 --> 01:47:59,181
带一打录音室警察来。这地方马上就会变成疯人院。
Bring a dozen studio cops. This place'll be a madhouse in a minute.

1435
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:01,433
什么?
What?

1436
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:04,561
告诉斯坦利，他划伤了自己三处。
Tell Stanley he slashed himself in three places.

1437
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:25,040
嘿，尼克，振作起来。
Hey, Nick, snap out of it.

1438
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:30,421
去吧，收拾一下。改变你的衣服。会有一块漂亮的…嘿,爸爸!
Go on, clean up. Change your clothes. There'll be a nice piece of... Hey, pop!

1439
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,298
猛男，我在跟你说话呢!
Punchy, I'm talking to you!

1440
01:48:34,383 --> 01:48:36,218
来吧，振作起来。
Come on, snap out of it.

1441
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:41,890
你杀了他。
You killed him.

1442
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:46,437
你们所有人。
The whole bunch of you.

1443
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:48,939
你发现他。

1444
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,651
杀了他。
Killed him.

1445
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,113
消失。
Go away.

1446
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,669
没事的，汉克。我一切都好。
It's all right, Hank. I'm all right.

1447
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:45,037
帮助她,霍雷肖。她不喜欢我。
Help her, Horatio. She doesn't like me.

1448
01:49:46,205 --> 01:49:48,707
记者，很多人，随时会来。
Reporters, loads of them, will be here any minute.

我会告诉记者的。

-没有必要。我将在这里。-所以才有必要
- That won't be unnecessary. I'll be here. - That's why it's necessary.

1451
01:49:53,462 --> 01:49:56,548
现在不是争论的时候，凯蒂。

1452
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:59,009
你在这里的工作已经结束了。

我来讲这个故事。
I'll tell the story.

1455
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:08,977
他自杀了。
He killed himself.

1456
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:15,275
出于对别人痛苦痛苦的爱，他放弃了救恩。
Out of a pained and anguished love he had for others, he gave up his salvation.

1457
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:21,573
但没有人比他更敬畏生命，更热爱生活。
But no man had a greater reverence for life, a greater zest for living.

1458
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:24,493
是的，他错了。
Yes, he was wrong.

1459
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:29,498
但他不能再继续伤害他爱的人了。
But he just couldn't go on hurting those he loved.

1460
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:27,097
查理。
Charlie.

1461
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:30,809
查理。
Charlie.

1462

01:51:53,498 --> 01:51:54,708
救命!
Help!

1469
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,127
救命!
Help!

1470
01:51:58,754 --> 01:52:00,255
救命!
Help!

1471
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,300
救命!
Help!
