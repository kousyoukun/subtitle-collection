1
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,050
Hey, babe. So happy to see you!

2
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,220
Hi! I got your flowers. That was so sweet of you.

3
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,440
Of course. Well, I know you're
finishing your Global Health paper today

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,020
and you've been working really hard on it.

5
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,190
Well, I'm almost done, so, maybe

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,780
you want to come over and Netflix and chill and...

7
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,240
What?

8
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,200
You mean you want to fuck?

9
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,240
I did not say that!

10
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,450
-Oh, my God!    -I know.

11
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,120
No! I was being more subtle than that!

12
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,120
I know. I'm sorry.

13
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,540
Yes, I am so down for that.

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,420
It's been like three fucking days.

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,170
My balls are so blue right now,

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,970
like dark blue, Uh-oh. Like almost black.

17
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,090
No, I'm fucking serious. Here, check it out.

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,600
I believe you. I believe you.

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
Okay.

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,850
I'll see your almost-black balls later.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,810
Cool, Steph.

22
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,060
Come over any time after 6:00. Okay, hun?

23
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,860
Okay. Dude, we are going to Netflix and chill this shit so hard.

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,070
Peaky Blinders. Kimmy Schmidt!

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,610
Movember's over.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,570
Time to shave the pornstache.

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,530
Sorry. Making a Murderer!

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,120
Narcos!

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,040
Stranger Things!

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,540
Black balls!

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,560
Anyways, Ned followed his dreams

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,940
and turned a run-down old printing
press into the industry powerhouse

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,150
known today as the Fleming Company.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,820
Best boss in the world!

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,030
The Fleming Company!

36
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,400
We're talking

37
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,570
brochures for Steelcase furniture,

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,940
half the specialty jobs in Grand Rapids

39
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,620
and who could forget the Domino's Pizza circular?

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,830
But before all that...

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,170
Ned met a young Michigan Wolverine, Barbara Welsh.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,050
How did this older guy get me?

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,720
Ned took her on their first date to see his favorite band...

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,510
-Kiss!    -Kiss!

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,430
My favorite band, too!

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,850
Rock and roll!

47
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,350
A few years later,

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,730
the stork brought my sister, Stephanie.

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,020
She's so cute.

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,860
They weren't close at all.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,320
-Oh, dropping her off at school.    -Yeah.

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,110
Then came me, Scotty F.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,410
Did we have another child?

54
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,320
-I forgot about that second baby.    -Oh, we had another child.

55
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,620
Anyways, Big Cheese.

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,910
I'm sorry, guys. I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this.

57
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,080
But I love you, Dad. Happy Birthday.

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,130
Way to go, Scotty!

59
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,790
I love you, too, buddy.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,210
Thank you. Wow!

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,470
That was fantastic.

62
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,380
We've got one last surprise for you.

63
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,760
That's right. Ladies and gentlemen,
live from her dorm room at Stanford...

64
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,760
it's my sister, Stephanie!

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,680
-Hi, everyone!    -Hey, honey!

66
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,600
Hey, Steph! Hey, it's Kevin!

67
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,360
-Hi, Kevin!    -Kevin.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,320
-Can we see?    -Sorry.

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,190
-Hi, Momma.    -Hi!

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
Hi, Dad.

71
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,740
The birthday boy.

72
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,860
Hey, honey.

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,870
You guys look like you're having so much fun.

74
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,530
And I wish I could be there with you.

75
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,290
She's so sweet.

76
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,750
-Yeah.    -Get out.

77
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,040
Yeah, I just wanted to say, Dad, that I love you.

78
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,500
I love you, too, honey.

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,920
-I love you more.    -No, you don't.

80
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,210
Love you to the moon and back.

81
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,090
I'll let you win this round. Okay, Pops?

82
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,300
Even though you're now like...

83
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,680
...ancient.

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,140
You are still...

85
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,010
You asked me to come over.

87
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,560
You're early. I said after 6:00.

88
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,770
-All right.    -Give me a sec,

89
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,140
-I'm on the phone.
-Got it. Sorry. It's just my friend. Anyway.

90
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,690
Happy birthday to you

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh, my goodness.

92
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,110
Oh, Laird, what are you...

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,190
Go finish your call.

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm just getting ready to Netflix and chill, baby.

95
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,780
-No, not now, Laird.    -Oh, my goodness.

96
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,820
Kimmy Schmidt!

97
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,030
-Pull up your pants.    -Marco Polo.

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,240
Oh, my God!

99
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,580
How do you make it stop?

100
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,960
Whoa, whoa, Mom, you just took a screenshot.

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,460
Happy, happy birthday Happy, happy birthday

102
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,540
Kevin, help her out. Kevin.

103
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,790
Happy birthday, happy birthday

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,530
♪ Mi oh my, it's a wonderful life ♪

105

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,190

108
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,660
Hey, there he is. Happy birthday, Big Cheese.

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,830
Thanks, Jim.

110
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,120
Jerry. Hey, Ned.

111
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,750
-Fun dinner last night.    -Hey, Jerry.

112
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,910
Thanks. Lou.

113
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,370
Hey, Cheese, can I have a minute?

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,250
Sure. Good morning, Joyce.

115
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,840
Great party.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,630
Hold all his calls.

117
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,510
You gotta be kidding me.

118
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,430
Big Lots is bailing out on us?

119
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,300
We've had that account since '06.

120
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,260
They're moving all their print work to China.

121
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
Oh, God.

122
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,390
Cheese, we're already getting pummeled by Evite, Stamp-Free

123
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,940
and the rest of those dot-coms.

124
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,650
And at this rate, we'll be Chapter 11 by March.

125
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,070
What about Dick's Sporting Goods?

126
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,110
Well, I mean, I'm still trading calls with my guy.

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
But, Ned, can I be honest with you?

128
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,950
I can't keep this from Patty much longer.

129
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,870
Lou, haven't I kept us going?

130
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,790
Yeah. I mean, it's what you do.

131
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,540
I just need a little more time. That's all.

132
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,710
You are the maestro.

133
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,090
Maybe you'll pull off a Christmas miracle.

134
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,550
-Yeah.    -Yeah.

135
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,920
By the way, good job keeping that game face last night.

136
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,920
Oh. Thanks.

137
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,380
That was some shindig, man.

138
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,390
Yeah, it was fun.

139
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,680
Well, till the kid had his farter all over the screen in 3-D.

140
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,010
I was like, Whoa!

141
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,470
"That's a lot, man."

142
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
And get this...

143
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,350
Stephanie now wants us to fly out...

144
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,150
to meet the man behind the crack over the holidays.

145
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,940
With everything that's going on here,
that's the last thing I want to do.

146
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,320
Well, hold on now. This is the first serious boyfriend?

147
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,410
Yeah. Apparently.

148
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,620
I mean, it's so strange.

149
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,040
I mean, Stephanie and I have always been so close.

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,910
And yet she has never even mentioned this guy.

151
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,370
That's the way it goes, Cheese.

152
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,920
I thought I knew everything about Lou Junior,

153
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,250
when he was down at Ohio State.

154
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,760
Out of nowhere, he comes dragging home this Buckeye

155
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,760
that he's been dating for over a year.

156
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,300
-No.    -Yeah.

157
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,140
Nice girl, but still. She's so controlling.

158
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,310
I'm sorry. I don't mean it like that

159
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,270
because I don't know her that well. But I don't like her.

160
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,690
-I don't.    -Lou.

161
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,360
It's just what happens, you know?

162
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,480
Lou, what is the point of all this?

163
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,190
Go out there and meet him.

164
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,280
I know we going through a lot right now

165
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,870
but hell, Lou Junior is talking about getting married in May.

166
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,780
Married.

167
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,030
Once they're not under your roof,

168
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
there's no telling what they're into.

169
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,210
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
He does want you to speak at the wedding

170
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,670
and say some kind words. Oh.

171
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,210
I told him that I would talk to you about it.

172
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,960
And they'd like to get married at your house in the backyard.

173
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,050
-Well...    -But anyway...

174
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm just saying you might want
to get out there and meet this kid.

175
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,720
Because, I mean, you saw it.

176
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,140
You saw it, he's a free spirit.

177
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,890
You mean...

178
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,600
You heard him come into the room.

179
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,520
He came in there guns blazing.

180
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,770
He had that revved up energy where he was like...

181
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,070
bow-bow-bow-bow.

182
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,400
He just wants to go and go and go...

183
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,200
and just morning, noon and night, and "Stephanie, here I am."

184
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,910
"Stephanie, here I come. I'm coming again."

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,660
I remember being that age, don't you?

186
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,160

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,720
Oh, gosh, it is so gorgeous here.

191
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm very excited that you guys are all out here.

192
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,190
We're very excited.

193
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,940
There's a few things that I wanna tell you about Laird

194
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,940
that I didn't feel like getting into over the phone because...

195
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,360
Watch, honey...

196
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,030
You missed our exit.

197
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,360
Actually, I missed it on purpose.

198
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,950
Laird and I thought,

199
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,700
it'd be better if we all stayed at his house.

200
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,700
His house?

201
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,660
When did this come up? Did you know about this?

202
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,080
Are you sure his parents have enough room?

203
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,460
I mean, he doesn't live with his parents.

204
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,040
Honey, we're not gonna be comfortable at some crash pad.

205
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,590
He lives by himself. It's not a crash pad,

206
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,300
but it's much nicer than the Sheraton.

207
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,920
Nicer than the club floor?

208
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,510
I smooth-talked the manager. We got a suite at the regular rate.

209
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,640
What? That's what I'm talking about, Big Cheese.

210
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,430
-That is impressive.    -We have to turn back.

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,180
-Free continental breakfast.    -Yes.

212
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,890
Mint on the pillow, turndown service,
all things available at the Sheraton.

213
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,400
I mean, is your lover going to have that?

214
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,820
Your lover? Your lover?

215
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,940
We already all know that you've seen his penis.

216
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,150
-What?    -Scott!

217
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,190

220
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,870
Actually, this is the gatehouse.

221
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,580
Gatehouse?

222
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,910

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,300
Is that a facial recognition scanner?

225
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,840

Honey, who exactly are you dating?

231
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,820
Laird started this company called Guerrilla Gang.

232
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,400
You play Ape Assassins, right?

233
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,120
Are you kidding me? Yeah, that was my jam in the eighth grade.

234
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Great, that's him.

235
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,490
So, he makes video games?

236
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,200
-Apps, Dad.    -This is it!

237
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,790
This is his house? Mmm-hmm.

238
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,330
Are you sure this isn't an Apple Store or something?

239
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,250
Oh, my God. What is up, you gang?

240
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,630
I know!

241
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,760
The Flemings are here. You have arrived!

242
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,720
Hi, buddy. Hi.

243
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,430
Hello, sweetheart.

244
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,550
-Don't touch anything.    -How was traffic?

245
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
-It was okay. Hi, they're here!    -Hello.

246
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,140
Hello to you, Ned Fleming.

247
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,770
-Barbara.    -Yes.

248
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,100
You are perfect.

249
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,270
Well, thank you. Oh, my God.

250
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,980
And this must be the main man. Scotty, huh?

251
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,360
-Yup.    -All right. Hey.

252
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,030
-Who are you?    -Gustav.

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,570
I am Gustav. Yes.

254
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,080
I never know how to describe you.

255
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,330
Um, well, estate manager is cool, Stephy, yes.

256
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
That works.

257
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,870
I used to run the Four Seasons group in Asia

258
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,460
but after some point, you know,

259
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,170
the corporate life becomes a bit of a snooze-fest.

260
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,170
You know, "Tiffany's this, Cartier that."

261
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,710
But, you know. Just dot, dot, dot. Enough already.

262
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,470
You know what I'm talking about, Ned.

263
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,800
Oh, yeah. Sure.

264
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,970
Boring.

265
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,680
-Where's Laird?    -Laird is upstairs.

266
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,600
He is just finishing a teleconference.

267
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,770
-He'll be right out.    -Oh, okay. Why don't we go up then?

268
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,480
-Laird, I'm Ned.    -No, no, no.

269
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,310
No, this is Randy. He's our intern.

270
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,020
Just graduated summa cum laude at MIT.

271
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,980
So Randy, shake a leg. Get their luggages.

272
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,320
Yes, sir.

273
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,070
The motherfucking Flemings are in the house!

274
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,990
Yes!

275
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,040
This is fucking awesome!

276
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
Get up here. I'm so psyched to meet you.

277
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,460
Family, baby. Fuck yeah!

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, my God.

279
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,500
Scotty.

280
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,760
Yes, my brotha! Welcome.

281
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,170
-Hey, Barb.    -Hi.

282
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,970
Welcome.

283
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,600
Hey, Ned. All right. Oh, yes.

284
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,020
Yes. Yes.

285
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,480
-Yes.    -So glad you're here.

286
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,860
-Yes.    -Hey. Hi.

287
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,060
-Hey, baby.    -Hi.

288
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,900
I fucking missed you.

289
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,320
Why aren't you wearing a shirt on your body? Oh.

290
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,450
Don't worry about that. I have a little surprise.

291
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,280
Let's stay half an hour and then we go back to the hotel.

292
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,540
-That's a good plan. Thank you. Dad, come on.
-This place is so sick.

293
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,410
-Yeah, it's sick.    -25 minutes.

294
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
That's it.

295
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,170
Hey! Just leave her alone.

296
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,720
Hey, oh, Ned. Ned.

297
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,300
Ned, would you look at that.

298
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,840
That's your face, Sis. Oh.

299
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,180
Very good likeness.

300
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,310
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

301
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,180
The Stephy tattoo. I got it, like, a week after we met, right?

302
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,930
-One week.    -You know, right on my heart.

303
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,310
Great. Okay, do you guys want to go see the house?

304
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,520
Uh... We probably should...

305
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,690
-We came to stop and say hey.    -Yeah. We should go.

306
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
Actually, no.

307
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,610
No. Before we go, um...

308
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,400
I have a little surprise for everybody.

309
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,700
Shit. I'm fucking nervous.

310
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,120
Do you want to consult me about it?
You want to talk to me before you...

311
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,290
You know what? No, I'm just jumpin' in. All right?

312
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,330
I'm just going to do this.
Laird, it's going to be fucking great.

313
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,080
Ta-da!

314
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,830
Oh, my God.

315
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,300
I just got it done this morning

316
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,960
Yeah. I bet it's red, huh?

317
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,220
I need a little feedback.

318
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,430
-Is that our Christmas card?    -Yes.

319
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,260
Yeah! That's exactly what I used. How'd you know?

320
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,470
Look, he even got Noodle in there.

321
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,810
Hurt like balls.

322
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,390
Gosh, it says "Happy Holidays" and everything.

323
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,640
What?

324
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,690
-Get the fuck out of here.    -Okay.

325
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,110
It says "Happy Holidays?"

326
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,270
Barb, fuck you.

327
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,650
God damn.

328
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,990
I gave the guy the Christmas card.
I didn't know he put "Happy Holidays" on there.

329
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,530
-Wow.    -Fuck.

330
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,490
Guess it's stuck on there, huh?

331
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,910
-Oops.    -Fuck.

332
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,990
Well, you know, you guys were coming over...

333
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,910
I was so excited, I just had to do something, you know?

334
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,670
Well, that is something, all right.

335
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,590
You know what? Sometimes, you just got to say, "Fuck it."

336
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,590
Fuck it!

337
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,840
-You should...    -Laird,

338
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,920
this is a 15-year-old child.

339
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,510
So, we don't really...

340
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,220
Oh, shit.

341
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,600
-You don't say fuck?    -No, Mom, I...

342
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Heck yeah, I cuss.

343
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,970
No, you don't.

344
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
-You do?    -Yeah.

345
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,140
Oh, he cusses. No, you don't.

346
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,980
Yeah, bro, what's your favorite cuss word?

347
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,020
Oh, boy.

348
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,400
-Don't egg him on like that.    -What's your favorite?

349
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,360
Titties.

350
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,820
Titties? Titties.

351
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,110
Stop it. Stop that.

352
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,700
Titties? Classic.

353
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,870
Okay. We should be going.

354
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,540
-Nice one. What else you got?    -Asshole.

355
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,080
-Asshole.    -All right. That's enough.

356
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
Okay. Another good body part.

357
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,830
-What else?    -Dicking. Double dicking.

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,460
-Double dicking.    -Okay.

359
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,830
Wait. Hold on. Double dicking?

360
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,540
-Are you happy?    -That's a new one on me, bro.

361
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,630
What the fuck is that?

362
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,050
What the hell is that? Is that like dick to dick?

363
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,470
Okay! Good night! We're going to the hotel.

364
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,760
This kid is nasty and I fucking like it.

365
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,220
-Yeah.    -Yes!

366
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,850
All right, let's do the tour.

367
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,060
I'll show you around! All right?

368
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,480
Just throw your shit anywhere.

369
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,940
-You little double-dicker, come on.
-Throw your stuff anywhere.

370
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,730
By the way, I'm a huge fan. I'm part of the online Ape Army.

371
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,730
Awesome.

372
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,400
You know, this is what I was trying to tell you guys in the car.

373
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,110
This is okay here?

374
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,360
Do you want to take your coat off?

375
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,120
Uh, no. Nope. I'm fine.

376
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,580
Come on, guys.

377
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,290
All right, so this here's the kitch.
This is where we keep the food.

378
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
The dining room.

379
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,290
That's a sculpture of a couple people fucking.

380
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,290
Painting of a fat squirrel.

381
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,130
And this one's called "Triple Team,"

382
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,720
self-explanatory.

383
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,430
All right. This is the den.

384
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,430
These dudes are just testing out video games.

385
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,390
Ned, Stephy says that you're pretty serious about your bowling,

386
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,350
so I had a couple lanes installed.

387
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,100
Oh, my God.

388
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,310
None of this was here?

389
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,230
No.

390
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,530
You said you were fixing a crack in the foundation.

391
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,280
Is that us?

392
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,860
Yeah, I got the images off your league's Facebook page.

393
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,200
That's so insane.

394
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,830
Dad, look, he even got in your signature "crotch chop."

395
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,830
Oh, yeah.

396
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,040
Wow.

397
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,210
All right, this here is where we develop a few apps

398
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,250
for the Apple and Android platforms.

399
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,170
Hey, gang, say hi to the Flemings.

400
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,420
-Hey, guys.    -Hey, what's up?

401
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,380
Wait, I don't understand. Do your employees live here?

402
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,340
Uh, maybe some of them do. I don't really know.

403
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,550
Gustav is actually an amazing architect.

404
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,260
We designed this place together.

405
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,390
When did you go to Machu Picchu?

406
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,480
Hun, when did you put these up?

407
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,350
What the heck is that moose?

408
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,690
That's a Phillip Manfredi.

409
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,060
Great pick-up, Barb.

410
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,280
Stephy told me that you're this
amazing art and photography professor.

411
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,030
-That's awesome.    -Mmm-hmm.

412
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,450
I teach a couple of classes at a local community college.

413
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,120
Don't be so modest, Mom. You're an amazing photographer.

414
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,290
Oh, that looks like a real dead moose.

415
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,790
Well, that's exactly what it is, Ned.

416
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,670
A dead moose suspended in its own urine.

417
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,840
It's meant to symbolize the way
that our culture has imprisoned our minds.

418
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,970
I got to tell you, Ned, great art really gets me aroused.

419
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,720
It's actually a very strong aphrodisiac.

420
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,770
Laird.

421
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,390
Not that you need any help
getting turned on by that gorgeous woman.

422
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,640
Honey.

423
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,520
What? Your mom is beautiful.

424
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,480
-She is.    -She deserves some props for that.

425
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,650
Well, I'll take a compliment wherever I can get one.

426
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,070
Well, here's another one. You got a bangin' bod, too.

427
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,110
All right.

428
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,570
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

429
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,320
Richard Blais, everybody.

430
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,000
This is the maestro of molecular gastronomy.

431
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, my God. That's that cute one from Top Chef.

432
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,790
Oh, he's the one who goes, "Bam!"

433
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,250
No, that's Emeril. He's a fucking dick, that guy.

434
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,670
Dickie Blais what's up?

435
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,430
Yeah, so Laird thought it would
be a fun idea to do a pop-up restaurant

436
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,640
just in your honor tonight.

437
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,300
-Did he?    -Yeah.

438
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,180
And I have here a little amuse-bouche.

439
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,140
So if anyone's looking for a little pre-dinner snack,

440
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,390
you can head on up here.

441
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,270
Count me in, 'cause I'm famished.

442
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,190
All right.

443
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,980
There are so many surprises.

444
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,570
I know.

445
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,860
You're hungry, you've come to the right place.

446
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,530
I've got surf and turf for you.

447
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,780
Steak and lobster.

448
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,070
Yum, yum.

449
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,120
My version of surf and turf, edible soil and plankton foam.

450
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,200
Dig in. Oh.

451
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,210
Wow, can't wait for dinner.

452
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,370
No.

453
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,670
Hey, so I think it's going great, right?

454
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,710
I think they've already accepted me.

455
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm getting a little bit of a different vibe.

456
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,920
Oh, really? Like what?

457
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,380
Don't try so hard.

458
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm not, what do you mean?

459
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,930
You put in a bowling alley for my dad

460
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,970
and you got a tattoo of my entire family on your back.

461
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,430
Was the tattoo too much?

462
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,730
-Yes.    -Fuck.

463
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,440
Shit, I knew it.

464
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,070
Yeah, Gustav said the same thing.

465
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,320
Okay, don't worry...

466
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,400
I won't get any more tattoos of them while they're here.

467
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,650
-Thank you.    -Okay.

468
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,860
I love you.

469
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,280
I love you, too.

470
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,370
Okay.

471
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,290
Oh, one more thing, stop calling them motherfuckers

472
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,130
and talking about how hot my mom is.

473
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, she's sneaky sexy, took me by surprise.

474
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,090
Dude, she is a MILF, like a genuine MILF.

475
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,390
And if it wasn't your MILF, she'd be a MIWF...

476
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,100
a mother I would fuck.

477
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,010
-But I won't.    -Okay.

478
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,890
-Of course.    -Thank you.

479
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,650
-All right, it's pretty.    -Yeah.

480
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
You know...

481
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,650
It's a lot.

482
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,490
-Yes! I mean, the moose...    -Yes.

483
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,330
And the language. Come on!

484
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,080
Mmm-hmm. A real moose!

485
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,120
-And he's coming onto your mother.    -That's not okay.

486
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,580
And the tattoo?

487
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,960
The tattoo! And how...

488
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,750
-32    -Oh, my. And you're...

489
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,090
-22.    -Yes!

490
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,460
You didn't like the mural of you
and Scotty down in the new bowling alley?

491
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,430
The bowling alley with the mural is...
And the bowling alley is regulation.

492
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,100
That's quite nice

493
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,180
and that's very rare to have something that nice.

494
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,730
And the polish that he used was quite... It was good. But...

495
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm sorry.

496
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I should have told you.

497
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,940
About everything, of course.

498
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,570
Honestly, I didn't know how to explain him over the phone.

499
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,450
I just kept imagining...

500
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,160
Mom Googling Laird Mayhew

501
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,040
and you guys jumping to conclusions
before you even got a chance to know him.

502
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,580
Well, now we know him.

503
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,420
No, you don't. You've been here for 15 minutes.

504
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,550
Yeah.

505
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,550
Thank you.

506
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,100
I wouldn't have asked you to come
out here and miss Christmas in Michigan

507
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,560
for the first time ever, if he wasn't...

508
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,020
...really important to me.

509
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,320
Okay.

510
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,160
You'll give him a chance?

511
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,660
-Okay.    -Okay, thank you. Thank you.

512
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,290
Come here.

513
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
I love you.

514
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,040
I love you, too.

515
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,380
So if I did Google him, what would I find?

516
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,430
Don't do it.

517
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,310
Well, I still don't see it.

518
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,350
Darling, this is the male, and he's thrusting.

519
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh, God.

520
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,320
All right, everybody, dinner is served!

521
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,530
Scotty! Come on, grab a stump.

522
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,860
Dad, you wanna go there? Mom.

523
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,490
You sure you don't want to take off your coat?

524
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
No. I'm good.

525
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,990
We do it family style here, so everyone just dig in.

526
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,490
It's super cas.

527
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,870
Okay, so we have three dishes for this evening.

528
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,000
We have sous-vide geoduck.

529
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,040
-We have Mission-style sea urchin burritos...    -Yum.

530
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,380
...with edible paper.

531
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,380
Because you're a printer.

532
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,050
-And last but not least...    -Sweet.

533
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,840
...we have smoked California bear.

534
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,390
-Enjoy.    -Oh, shit!

535
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,720
Thanks, Blais.

536
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,180
-Bear?    -Mmm.

537
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,560
Yo, Scotty, you see The Revenant?

538
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,060
No, I wanted to, but my parents don't
really let me watch R-rated movies.

539
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,770
-You're darn right we don't.    -He's only 15.

540
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,230
-You want some paper?    -Yes, certainly. Thank you.

541
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,860
I don't know what section that is.

542
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,610
Because that bear fucked that dude up!
Now we're gonna fuck this bear up.

543
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,240
Hey, what about that language?

544
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,410
Oh, shit. Sorry.

545
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,030
Ah, I think I've got the arts section here.

546
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,290
You better slow down, Barb.

547
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,410
You're gonna be full before you get to the funnies.

548
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,460
Ned.

549
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,090
So, um, how did you two meet?

550
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,890
-Uh, you want me to go?    -Yeah.

551
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,760
Okay.

552
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,600
Laird sponsored a talk on campus with Doctor Joanne Liu,

553
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,140
the head of Doctors Without Borders.

554
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,140
Oh!

555
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,100
Melinda Gates got me totally pumped

556
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Now I'm obsessed.

557
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,320
Wow.

558
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,780
-That's Bill Gates' wife.    -Yeah.

559
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,280
-She's great.    -Yeah.

560
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,740
That's terrific.

561
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,490
That's Steph's field of interest, too, so that's great.

562
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,330
Yeah, I know. Ned, you should've seen her at the talk.

563
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,750
She asked the most intelligent question. I was blown away.

564
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,960
Really? What did I say?

565
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,250
You were like...

566
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,960
"Hey, what's the connection between "
women's health and population density

567
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,590
"in indigenous communities?"

568
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,010
I was like, "Bam! Who's that?"

569
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,800
That's so sweet of you to remember that.

570
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,810
Of course I remember. Mmm...

571
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,760
-The first time I saw you.    -That's our girl.

572
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,680
She's always been the smartest person in the room.

573
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,770
-So true.    -Yeah.

574
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,980
-And the sexiest. My God.    -Well.

575
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,190
I couldn't keep my eyes off her.

576
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,780
-Her hair, and her eyes.    -Very pretty eyes.

577
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,150
The way her spine gently arches to meet the top of her tailbone.

578
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,660
I just wanna pitch a tent and live in there.
You know what I mean?

579
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,820
-No.    -You're taking it too far.

580
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,120
Quite the outdoorsman.

581
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,870
I just mean she's got a great body.

582
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,540
-Oh, well, yes. Mmm-hmm.    -Yeah.

583
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,000
She's a darling girl.

584
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,330
-Like you, Barb.    -Great genes.

585
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,210
Okay.

586
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,540
Two fit women.

587
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll have to agree with you there.

588
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,460
Ol' Slamming Bod Barb.

589
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,720
Two fit women and two lucky dudes...

590
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,510
And one double-dicker.

591
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,850
Okay, well.

592
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,190
Laird, when did you graduate from Stanford?

593
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,560
Oh, I didn't go to Stanford, bro.
I hardly even graduated from high school.

594
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,860
He's being modest.

595
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,570
He actually started writing code
for Sun Microsystems when he was 13.

596
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,320
-That's true.    -Wow, that's just like me.

597
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,530
I've been interning at the Fleming Company since,
what, the seventh grade?

598
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,870
Mm-hmm. Yup.

599
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,000
Future CEO, but you are going to college.

600
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,500
-I know, Dad. I know. I know.    -Just like your sister.

601
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,670
So, Steph, weren't your surprised

602
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,670
that this big tech mogul wanted to date you?

603
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,170
He said he was some low-level programmer at Uber.

604
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,680
I had no idea that he sponsored the entire event.

605
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,890
So he lied to you.

606
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,350
Oh, Ned, I had to.

607
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,890
I mean there are so many gold diggers in Silicon Valley.

608
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,390
They just wanna fuck you for your tech money.

609
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,230
-Language, baby.    -You gotta be careful.

610
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,400
I didn't spill the beans till April.

611
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,520
April? That's eight months ago. What?

612
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,690
Steph, over the phone, you said you've
only known each other for a couple of months.

613
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,910
-It was super casual at first.    -No.

614
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,110
No, it was not.

615
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,740
We exchanged I love you's on the third date.

616
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,240
-Remember? Right after we...    -The third date?

617
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,120
-Made love in the hot tub at Esalen in Big Sur?    -No, no, no.

618
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,250
-Where, what?    -Esalen in Big Sur.

619
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,370
Really?

620
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,580
Ned. Don't get the wrong idea.

621
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,590
It was not sexual at all. It was so much more than that.

622
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,920
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm confused.

623
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,380
Did you have intercourse or not?

624
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,800
Scotty, shut it.

625
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,220
Dad, I'm just trying to connect the dots here.

626
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,800
Look. Yeah, we did.

627
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,560
But what I'm saying is I was transformed.

628
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,770
Stephy opened up like a flower.

629
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,310
You should have seen it.

630
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,440
I shouldn't have seen it, but now I feel like I have.

631
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,980
I just want your parents to know

632
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,150
that you're living with someone who's completely devoted to you.

633
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,650
-Wait a minute.    -What-ing with someone?

634
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,610
-You say you're living together?    -Yeah.

635
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,450
No. We do not.

636
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Okay, five nights out of seven.

637
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,500
Your stuff is here.

638
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,960
You don't really stay at the dorm.

639
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,590
Do you have a toothbrush here?

640
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
-Yeah.    -That's cohabitating.

641
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,800
Scotty, stop talking and eat your paper.

642
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,670
Dad, we do not live together.

643
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,300
Yeah, we're cohabitating.

644
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,640
"Opened up like a flower."

645
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,640
Honey, I'm looking at the Esalen website right now

646
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,310
and there's nothing dirty about it.

647
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,150
You go up there for yoga classes and things like that.

648
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,990
They've been practically living together for a year.

649
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,650
Why didn't she just tell us that?

650
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,200
Where the heck are the towels?

651
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,870
He's even affected Scotty.

652
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,000
What is a double dicking, for crying out loud?

653
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,670
There she is.

654
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,290
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. She's gonna...

655
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,380
She better explain what the heck is going on here.

656
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,510
All right, so be nice.

657
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,840
Be like, "Oh, my God. I love your boyfriend. He's so normal."

658
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,180
I'm good.

659
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,300
Hi.

660
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,390
Hi, uh...

661
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,310
I thought you'd be Stephanie.

662
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Steph's super pooped.

663
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,690
We had a big fight because of the way I behaved at dinner.

664
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
Don't worry, we took a shower together and worked it out.

665
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,030
But I snuck out to have a little check in.

666
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,190
Okay. Well...

667
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,000
Ned, would you come join us?

668
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,370
I'm good here.

669
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,880
Oh, please. This is an Alaskan king.

670
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,550
There's so much room.

671
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,510
So much room.

672
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
It'd really mean a lot to me. Please?

673
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,050
Okay.

674
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Hey.

675
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,070
I owe you two an apology.

676
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,230
When I get nervous

677
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,030
all kinds of crap comes flying out of my mouth

678
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,070
and I know that's not how you guys roll.

679
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,030
No.

680
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,070
I was just trying to make a good impression.

681
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,910
Yeah. Well, you did. It was...

682
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,120
I mean you didn't, but it's okay.

683
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,370
It was an awkward dinner.

684
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,290
It was a unique situation for...

685
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,090
Yeah, but let's all just move on.

686
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,460
Okay. Great.

687
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,630
Truth be told,

688
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,050
I haven't spent a lot of time with parental figures.

689
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,300
I don't know if you know this, but I never knew my father.

690
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,560
Yeah, he picked up my mom in this bar in Oakland.

691
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,940
They had some sloppy car sex, and then never spoke again.

692
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,890
Yeah.

693
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,230
I'm not really close with my mom, either.

694
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,610
To be frank, she's kind of a motherfucking bitch.

695
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,610
If I had a nickel for every time I...

696
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,410
Yeah.

697
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,740
We're sorry to hear that.

698
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,620
That's some tough stuff, pal.

699
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,080
Yup. That's...

700
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,620
That's...

701
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,000
All right. Well, it's getting late, so...

702
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:34,960
Yeah.

703
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,960
I'm in love with your daughter, dudes.

704
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,300
And I'm just so fucking psyched to
get to know the people that raised her.

705
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,340
And we're gonna do Christmas just like you do at home.

706
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,470
Tomorrow night,

707
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,970
I'm gonna throw a party in your honor.

708
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,020
-Oh, you don't have to go to the trouble.
-You don't... It's not.

709
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,770
We're gonna do all the holiday shit.

710
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,860
Okay. Hmm. All the shit.

711
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,980
Ned, I'd love some guy time with you.

712
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,320
So maybe we could take a walk tomorrow morning?

713
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,780
-Okay.    -Okay, cool.

714
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,160
Justine, will you set Ned an alarm for 6:30 a.m.?

715
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,160
You got it, Laird.

716
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,200
Ned, an alarm's been set for you for 6:30 en la mañana.

717
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,330
What? Who is that?

718
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,040
That's Justine.

719
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,210
Yeah, she's like Siri, but awesome.

720
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,670
I got that chick from The Big Bang Theory,
Kaley Cuoco, to do the voice.

721
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,800
J, say hi.

722
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,180
Hey, Ned. Hey, Barb. How are you guys?

723
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,010
-Hi.    -Oh, my God.

724
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,350
Stephanie's told me so much about you.
Anything you need, I'm here.

725
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,690
-Okay.    -Thank you.

726
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,980
She can't... Can she see us?

727
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,320
She says that she can't, but I think that she can.

728
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,530
What the fuck are you talking about? You know I can't see them.

729
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,070
She's a perv.

730
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,200
Laird.

731
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,370
Anyway, I hope you two have a nice night's rest.

732
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, have a good night. Great night.

733
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,250
-Have a great night.    -Yeah.

734
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,380
My instinct is to hug you right now.

735
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,340
-Oh. No.    -I don't think you...

736
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,670
That's okay. Oh.

737
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,710
-Oh, my God.    -Barb.

738
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,090
Good night.

739
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,010
Peace.

751
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,410
Would you get a roll for me, please?

752
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,950
Papa make a poopie?

753
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,960
Yes. I made a poopie.

754
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,420
Did Daddy do a doo-doo?

755
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,630
Barb, just get the toilet paper, please?

756
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,840
All right. Well, you sit tight. I'm gonna go find you some TP.

757
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,010
Thank you.

758
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:28,630
Of course.

759
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,800
Mr. Playboy.

760
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,640
Unbelievable.

761
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,350
Who is that?

762
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,480
She's a bit of a Plain Jane.

763
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,850
-Darling?    -Yeah. Yup.

764
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,770
Just, um, crack the door and toss the roll, please.

765
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,980
It's gonna be a little more complicated than that.

766
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,650
Good morning, Ned.

767
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,490
It's Gustav.

768
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,490
Great.

769
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,990
As I've already told Barb, we are a paperless household.

770
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,160
Paperless? What?

771
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,200
It's a paperless house, darling.

772
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,500
I got that.

773
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,710
But how am I supposed to complete my business?

774
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,500
Well, all Japanese toilets

775
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,130
have a very effective and pleasant cleaning spray.

776
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,470
And I will be very happy

777
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,800
-to walk you through the entire process.    -Oh, God.

778
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,850
Ned, please locate the control panel to your left.

779
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,470
Okay, I see it.

780
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,020
Now on that control panel is a button

781
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,810
that shows an image of water spraying up.

782
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,810
Okay. And I just push it?

783
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,150
Just press it, yes.

784
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,070
Was that cologne?

785
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,570
Oh! Cologne? Oh, yes!

786
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,200
That is a designer-scented talcum powder.

787
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,200
But that button should not have activated that.

788
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,210
Ned, that is what is called
Big Pony for Men by the Ralph Lauren.

789
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,420
I'm excited to try.

790
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,880
-Can we please just continue?    -All right.

791
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,380
-Ned?    -Yes.

792
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,550
I would like to apologize sincerely again.

793
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,180
This is the 2018 model that you are on right now,

794
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,550
so they have not yet made an instruction manual in English yet.

795
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,890
So I'm going to take care of this on my end, all right?

796
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,770
So Ned, you focus on your end in there

797
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,560
and I will focus on your end out here.

798
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,570
-That's too good.    -This is it.

799
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,400
This should do it, Ned.

800
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,900
Okay. Something's whirring.

801
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,030
Something's spinning around in there.

802
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,910
No! Turn it off!

803
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,120
Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!

804
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,290
God!

805
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,750
Oh, scheisse!

806
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,080
We are having some technical difficulties.

807
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,790
That was the vaginal cleanse.

808
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
The what cleanse?

809
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,750
I just want a square of toilet paper.

810
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,090
The vaginal cleanse.

811
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,630
Which I hear is refreshing and apparently also very stimulating.

812
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,430
Just saying.

813
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,980
Ned?

814
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,060
Really?

815
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
I'm so sorry, Ned...

816
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,820
but I'm going to have to manually
reboot the system from the inside.

817
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,280
In here?

818
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,740
I am so sorry.

819
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,950
Fine.

820
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,950
Why not?

821
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,790
Barb, would you close the door? Sorry.

822
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,410
It's gonna be great.

823
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,790
Ned, I am blinders.

824
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,500
I see nothing. I smell nothing.

825
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,470
-The print is very small.    -Mm-hmm.

826
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,840
Okay, forgive me.

827
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,590
I can't see the instructions.

828
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,020
All right. What do we have here?

829
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,050
I had some stomach problems last night.

830
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,050
I think it was the bear.

831
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,470
I can guarantee you, it was the bear.

832
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,520
Turning on the fan.

833
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,730
Great. Wunderbar.

834
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,530
How'd it go?

835
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,410
I am so sorry that it took so long.

836
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,910
Ned, I'm going to need you to be completely still

837
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,370
while we try to lock in your location.

838
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,830
I'm sitting on a toilet, that's pretty still.

839
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,370
Searching, searching, und searching.

840
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,880
And we have target achieved!

841
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,550
And sploosh!

842
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
There you go, girls.

843
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,060
You raise chickens?

844
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,900
All free-range.

845
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,270
Cows, too.

846
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,780
Pigs, artisanal llamas.

847
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,570
Everything you eat here comes from within a 500-yard radius.

848
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,120
I call it "lawn to table eating."

849
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
There she is.

850
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,950
Hey, Daisy.

851
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,870
Oh. Hi.

852
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Go on, get.

853
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,880
So glad we're doing this, Ned.

854
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,920
I feel like I know you after
everything that Steph's told me about you,

855
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,630
but still not the same...

856
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,550
-Do you submit?    -Fuck you!

857
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,260
-Gustav!    -Ned, stay away!

858
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,390
You wanna fight?

859
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:33,770
-Tap out!    -No!

860
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,060
You want to tap out.

861
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,820
Okay, okay! Fine!

862
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,490
Nice work!

863
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,990
And your reactions are getting quicker.

864
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,240
-Really?    -Absolutely.

865
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:43,990
Thanks.

866
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,070
I am so sorry, Ned. I just didn't want you to get hurt.

867
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,950
Wait, so you just do this Pink Panther thing?

868
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,500
-Pink Panther?    -Pink Panther?

869
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,960
The Pink Panther from the Pink Panther movies.

870
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,300
When Cato attacks Inspector Clouseau to keep him sharp.

871
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,960
Are those really old? I never heard of it.

872
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,840
I'm not familiar, either, but it sounds absolutely charming.

873
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,970
Pink Panther.

874
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,510
-The movies?    -Mm-hmm.

875
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,680
Cato is his assistant, his houseboy.

876
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,190
-Houseboy?    -Well, it's...

877
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,310
That sounds racist.

878
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,650
He did call him "my little yellow friend." But...

879
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,690
I'm sorry, you have to understand, Ned.
Laird is the CEO of a massive tech company.

880
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,490
I don't like bodyguards around

881
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,490
so I have Goose train me in case I get kidnapped or whatever.

882
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,330
By the way, your Chun Kuk Do moves were very solid.

883
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,160
But what happened to the evasive parkour?

884
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,500
-Ah, evasive parkour.    -Yeah.

885
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,040
I totally fucking spaced!

886
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,830
There's always room to improve.

887
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,040
-All right.    -Thanks, man.

888
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,500
You got it, brother.

889
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,340
All right, ciao for now, you friends.

890
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,970
And you guys have a lovely chat.

891
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,550
Ned, come on. I wanna show you my office.

892
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,390
You know, that's like classic Pink Panther.

893
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,390
-This is where you work, huh?    -Yeah.

894
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,560
I have a den in the house where I do the financial stuff

895
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,900
but this is where all the big ideas happen.

896
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,990
Don't you need a computer and...

897
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,200
Nah. My girl Justine records everything.

898
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,490
Right, J?

899
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,410
Yep, I'm here. Hey, Ned.

900
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,580
Hey, why don't you play back a blip from yesterday's session?

901
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,200
All right, hold on. Fuck.
There's so much shit up here in your Cloud.

902
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,540
Okay, okay got it.

903
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,750
Come on, idiot, think. Names for games. Um...

904
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,340
Ape Assassins Six: Capuchin Chaos.

905
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,880
Uh, Silverback Salsa.

906
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,220
Baboon Bukkake.

907
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,680
Fuck! Wow, that's awful!

908
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,720
Bad idea.

909
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,050
Why? Why's that? Uh...

910
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,600
What does that mean?

911
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,560
Bukkake?

912
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,100
Just means a lot of things are
happening and you're feeling overwhelmed.

913
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,560
-Mm-hmm.    -Yeah.

914
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,610
Yeah. I've felt bukkake before.

915
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,070
Grab a seat. Make yourself comf. Let's break it down.

916
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,240
Just pop down right here on the floor.

917
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,870
There you go.

918
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,080
Ned, I think you and I have so much in common.

919
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,550
We see something we want and we just dive in

920
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,590
and we take it.

921
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Know what I mean?

922
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,050
Yeah.

923
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,800
Which is why...

924
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,060
...on Christmas Day...

925
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,730
I'm going to ask Stephy to marry me.

926
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,950
And I know how tight you two are.

927
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,950
Mm-hmm.

928
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,740
So I'd really, really

929
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,950
like your blessing.

930
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,420
Uh, Laird.

931
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,590
-Really appreciate you coming to me.    -'Course.

932
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,000
But, uh, the answer's no.

933
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,140
Dude, I'm so confused.

934
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,350
What the fuck? What the hell?

935
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,350
This went so much differently when I rehearsed it with Gustav.

936
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,100
Yeah. I asked you and you were like, "Yeah, dude. My son."

937
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,150
Laird. Listen to me, okay.

938
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,480
Beside the fact that I don't know you from a hole in the wall...

939
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,490
Stephanie is just not ready for this step in her life.

940
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,620
Oh, I'm totally getting the signals that she is.

941
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,450
I'm her father, I know her pretty well.

942
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,450
Okay, all right. All right, Ned...

943
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,290
Dude, I know I sprung this on you.

944
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,000
My bad. Okay? Let's just back it up.

945
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,210
-All right?    -All right.

946
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,510
Why don't you give me a few days to win you over, okay?

947
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,880
And by Christmas morning...

948
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,510
I promise, you're going to be calling me "son."

949
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,470
I'm gonna be calling you "Dad".

950
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,680
Don't think that's going to happen.

951
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,850
I think it's gonna, Dad.

952
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,850
Don't.

953
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,810
Dad, come on.

954
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,400
-Don't call me "Dad."    -Don't call you "Dad"?

955
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
I'm not your dad.

956
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,860
I mean, you're gonna be my dad.

957
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,860
No. No.

958
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,860
What, Dad?

959
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,410
Okay, now you're playing with me.

960
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,410
All right. Dad.

961
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,740
Look, Laird.

962
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,500
Why do you even care about what I think?

963
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,040
You're Stephanie's father.

964
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,050
I'm not gonna ask Stephanie to
marry me unless I have your blessing.

965
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,210
Okay.

966
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,670
Justine, did you get that?

967
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,550
Totes. Yeah, recorded every word.

968
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,720
Totes. And totes is what?

969
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,770
It means totally. But totally's
kind of long, so "totes" is just easier.

970
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,690
Okay. Good.

971
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,730
-Okay.    -Okay.

972
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,060
-All right, cool.    -Yeah.

973
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,570
But you gotta promise me

974
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,860
that you won't tell Steph anything about this.

975
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,610
About any of this.

976
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,410
Trust me, that is the last thing in the world I will do.

977
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,120
For reals, dude. I want it to be a surprise.

978
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,620
No word. I won't say a word.

979
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,910
Barb and Scotty, too. No clowning.

980
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
No clowning.

981
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,710
What?

982
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,130
I'd just feel a lot better about this if we pinky swore.

983
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,800
Oh.

984
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,260
-I see what you mean.    -Cool.

985
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,730
-Go get breakfast.    -Okay.

986
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,310
Fuck!

987
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,440
Sup, guys?

988
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,400
-Hey, boss.    -Mayhew!

989
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,610
♪ ...took a little longer ♪

990
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,430
♪ Go into the school gonna run another banger ♪

991
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,990
-The fuck?    -Come with me immediately.

992
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,410
The hell is this room?

993
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,660
Randy, get the fuck out.

994
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,950
-Yes, sir, Gustav.    -Mm-hmm.

995
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,170
I am on the needles und pins.

996
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,170
I need you to tell me how it
went right now or I'm going to burst.

997
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,170
-He said no!    -What? Okay, okay.

998
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,130
But how did you respond?

999
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,970
I was blindsided, man. I didn't know what to do.

1000
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
I challenged him.

1001
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,180
-Okay.    -I started calling him Dad.

1002
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,520
-Oy vey.    -The fuck, man!

1003
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,770
Why would you call him Dad? You're putting him at unease!

1004
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,820
You have to find a way in.

1005
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,320
You have to do something for him that's truly special

1006
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,820
so that he knows that your intentions are pure.

1007
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,820
Dude, Goose, I don't know how to talk to the guy.

1008
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,160
It's like we speak two different languages or something.

1009
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,330
-You do.    -Yeah.

1010
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,660
He speaks English.

1011
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,460
And you speak English with resounding amounts of "fuck."

1012
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,000
All right, Stephanie's been on my case, too.

1013
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,040
-Yes.    -I got it.

1014
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,000
-All right?    -Okay.

1015
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,130
-Right.    -All right, man.

1016
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,000
-Great.    -Great.

1017
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,800
You just fucking really hit me really hard.

1018
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,380
I know. I am sorry.

1019
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,510
It's just, Laird...

1020
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,050
...your relationship with Miss Stephanie

1021
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,720
is very special. It's the real deal.

1022
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:25,810
-Hey.    -Yes.

1023
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,850
Goose, I know I pay you a shit-ton of money,

1024
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,350
but you're my best friend.

1025
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,650
Our friendship is priceless.

1026
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,030
Hey. Thanks, brother.

1027
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,700
Okay.

1028
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,080
Okay. Ow! Mercy. Mercy.

1029
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Fuck.

1030
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,590
Bro, you're incredible.

1031
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,880
That was very imaginative

1032
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,880
how you took that tender moment
and used it as your pivot to attack.

1033
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,340
-Yeah.    -Very good.

1034
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,060
What's up, Cheese? I'm about to go to the football game.

1035
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,440
Lions, baby!

1036
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,900
Great. How's business?

1037
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,230
Tell me something good.

1038
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,590
Oh, uh...

1039
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,110
I talked to my guy over at Dick's Sporting Goods.

1040
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,010
Don't tell me they're going with China, too.

1041
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,900
Worse.

1042
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,950
Freaking online banner ads.

1043
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,910
No. Damn it. All right, listen.

1044
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,290
I'm gonna call Don Millis at Subaru of Southern Michigan.

1045
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,410
I heard a little rumor that they
might be looking for a new dance partner.

1046
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,120
Yeah, Don, the big guy, right?

1047
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,040
You guys go back to your car selling days.

1048
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,880
Yeah. It's worth a shot. Listen...

1049
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,090
I need you to go in and pull his card
from my rolodex while I look for a pen.

1050
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,090
You got it, Cheese. No, you got it.

1051
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,300
So how goes it in Cali?

1052
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,430
It feels like we've landed in The Twilight Zone.

1053
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Did you find the card?

1054
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,310
Yeah. I got it right here.

1055
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,400
Just hang on. I have nothing to write with here.

1056
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,980
This whole house is paperless.

1057
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,110
Paperless?

1058
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,610
Well, how do you wipe your ass?

1059
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,570
You don't.

1060
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,110
They have these Japanese toilets that...

1061
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,820
It's one of those little squat jobs, little squatter.

1062
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,620
No. Just... never mind. Just give me the number.

1063
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,120
Hey, Ned, I'm here.

1064
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,580
I can take it down for you.

1065
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,000
Justine, please just... I'm fine.

1066
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,170
Just go away.

1067
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,630
All right, I'm just trying to help.
You don't have to be such a dick.

1068
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,300
Whoa, whoa. Cheese, who is that?

1069
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,130
She's got a foul little mouth.
Is that the kid's secretary you fighting with?

1070
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,800
No, no, no. That's the woman who lives in the ceiling.

1071
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:26,930
Cheese, what she look like?

1072
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,930
-The woman who lives...    -You say she lives in the ceiling?

1073
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,930
She's a disembodied voice that...

1074
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,690
Never mind. I'll explain later.

1075
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:36,150
The voice sounds sexy. Are they using somebody famous?

1076
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,360
I wouldn't say too famous. You know, million dollars a week,

1077
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,150
biggest show in the world, no big deal.

1078
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
-Lou.    -She can hear me?

1079
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,990
Of course I can hear you.

1080
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,320
How you doin', baby?

1081
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,450
Better now that I'm talking with you.

1082
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,530
Just give me the number. I'm calling him now.

1083
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,370
Let's catch some waves.

1084
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,630
Tsunami.

1085
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,710
That guy's cool.

1086
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,880
Yeah, Goose is the best.

1087
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,340
Laird, I'm gonna be honest with you, buddy.

1088
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,300
Okay.

1089
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,510
Gorillas in board shorts is a fun touch.

1090
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
-Yeah.    -I'll give you that.

1091
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,850
But when the only mission is to get to shore,
I'm not feeling enough drama there.

1092
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,020
You know?

1093
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,360
You know what? You're so fucking right.

1094
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:20,570
Fuck!

1095
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,230
We've been developing this limp dick for months.

1096
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,700
You come and you play it for five minutes,
you know exactly what's wrong with it.

1097
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,030
You're a sharp little fucker. You know that?

1098
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,870
Thank you.

1099
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,040
I mean, for real, man. I appreciate it.

1100
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,410
It's just nice to be listened to.

1101
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,370
What do you mean?

1102
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,250
I'm gonna be running my dad's business one day.

1103
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,250
Uh-huh.

1104
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,340
But he won't even listen to any of my ideas about innovation.

1105
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,050
-What?    -Right?

1106
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,380
You're next gen, dude.

1107
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,840
It's where all the new seeds come from. Everyone knows that.

1108
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,010
And I told him that. I was like...

1109
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,680
"Dad, if you're gonna unleash me to my full potentsh...

1110
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,890
"I need a seat at the table."

1111
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,180
He just won't listen to me.

1112
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,600
Um... Get that seat!

1113
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:56,770
I will get that seat.

1114
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,520
-Gotta get that seat, Scotty.    -That's my seat.

1115
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,900
-Nobody else touch it.    -No.

1116
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,730
Where is that seat? It's at the fucking table.

1117
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,940
And I'm gonna get that seat at that table.

1118
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,860
You deserve a fucking throne, dawg.

1119
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,400
-Yeah, the Iron Throne.    -Iron Throne.

1120
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,030
-Iron Throne.    -Game of Thrones over here!

1121
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,030
I'm breathing fire and grabbing titties left and right.

1122
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,280
Fucking King Joffrey up in this.

1123
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,450
Those are my titties!

1124
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,540
-You're the next in line.    -That's me.

1125
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,870
My man.

1126
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,750
Oh, God.

1127
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,590
They're paying your student loans.

1128
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,110
Stamp Free Invites.

1129
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,740
Oh, man.

1130
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,120
Ho, ho, ho!

1131
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,790
Wow.

1132
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,250
-Is that a horse?    -That is a llama.

1133
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,330
-Oh, a llama.    -Hi.

1134
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,630
Hello.

1135
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,630
-Oh, my goodness.    -Hey, girl.

1136
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,130
We don't have those in...

1137
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,630
Dad!

1138
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,970
There you are. This is insane!

1139
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,470
Oh, you working on the books?

1140
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,470
Uh, yeah, you know. Just the little stuff.

1141
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,470
I was thinking about Laird's Christmas party.

1142
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,480
Gustav gave me a preview of the guest list.

1143
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,020
And, Dad, it is a veritable "who's who"
of Silicon Valley power players.

1144
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,820
Tyson Modell is coming!

1145
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,820
-Wait, who is he?    -What?

1146
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,030
-He's the kid who founded Ghostchat.    -Oh, right.

1147
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,160
He turned down three billion dollars
from Facebook, and he's only 24 years old.

1148
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,490
I'm gonna broker a sit-down between you two.

1149
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,700
Dad, thank you for telling me to pack a blazer.

1150
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,960
Now, should I throw on a tie
or should I keep it business casual?

1151
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,670
Scotty, just listen to me, all right?

1152
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,050
Most of these Internet companies are built on smoke and mirrors.

1153
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,340
-What?    -Don't get sucked in.

1154
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,670
That whole industry is based on hooey.

1155
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,970
I'm gonna drop some knowledge on you.

1156
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,350
Times are changing, Pops.

1157
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,560
And not everything you think is hooey is hooey.

1158
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
Wow. That's profound.

1159
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,390
Profound.

1160
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,810
And you...

1161
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,150
Hooey-meister himself.

1162
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,900
You're nothing but an octopus.

1163
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,110
An octopus.

1164
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,150
Merry fuckin' Christmas

1165
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,390
What are you pouring?

1166
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,400
We are doing a deconstructed eggnog tonight.

1167
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,610
Eggnog. Yes. Thank you.

1168
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,020
Where you from, boss?

1169
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,070
Michigan.

1170
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,740
Oh, Michigan. You in the car business?

1171
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,030
Uh, no. Printing. Ned Fleming.

1172
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,740
-Elon Musk.    -Elon Musk?

1173
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,530
-Yeah.    -Tesla, Elon Musk?

1174
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,910
-Yeah.    -Wow.

1175
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,250
How do you know Laird?

1176
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,580
He's dating my daughter.

1177
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,080
Uh-oh.

1178
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,420
-Nice talking to you.    -Yeah.

1179
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,630
What?

1180
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,130
Oh, hey! Hi, honey!

1181
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,470
Could I get a glass of white wine, please?

1182
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,760
-Ooh, hiya, handsome.    -Hi!

1183
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,600
-You look great.    -Oh, come on.

1184
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,430
-No, you do.    -Thank you.

1185
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,310
I'm just getting in the holiday spirit.

1186
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,150
So what were you talking to Laird about for so long?

1187
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,780
I got the entire Mayhew family saga.

1188
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,280
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1189
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,450
No, no, turns out it was pretty interesting actually.

1190
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,740
His mother was a secretary at one of these tech companies.

1191
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,290
Can I interest you in a Kobe beef slider?

1192
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,750
-Ooh, yum.    -Real food?

1193
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,790
Yes, I'm starving.

1194
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,500
Wait, what?

1195
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,250
Oh, God.

1196
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,090
-Ma'am? Kobe squirt?    -No, thanks.

1197
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,250
Thank you.

1198
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,420
It's actually pretty tasty.

1199
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,590
Anyway, she saw all these young programmers getting rich.

1200
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,300
So she basically forced Laird

1201
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:05,430
to spend his entire childhood inside, learning computers.

1202
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,270
I think that's kind of sad, right?

1203
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,320
He ate it. Hmm.

1204
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,160
He's an octopus.

1205
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:28,000
That kid is wrapping his tentacles
around every member of this family.

1206
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,500
He's manipulating you.

1207
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,000
Darling, we need to bring this down a notch.

1208
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,300
Okay? You think you're at war with Laird.

1209
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,170
But he's not fighting. It's just you.

1210
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,050
Come on, let's go meet his friends. They look darling.

1211
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,840
Oh, God.

1212
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,970
Totally tanked porting the thin-client apps for the JDK build.

1213
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,390
The fuck? So you had to rewrite all the code?

1214
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,560
Mm-hmm. By myself.

1215
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,900
-But did you do it?    -Oh, you know I did!

1216
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,480
-Hey, there they are!    -Hi.

1217
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,650
Looking like a babe.

1218
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,860
Look who's looking sharp.

1219
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,320
-Okay!    -Hello!

1220
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,320
Tyson, these are Stephanie's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Fleming.

1221
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,860
Oh, no. Barb and Ned, please.

1222
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,740
So it was fucked up, man.

1223
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,370
It took me two weeks on the J2EE database...

1224
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,540
trying to get the interface to react with the server...

1225
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,710
so I can get the containers up and running again.

1226
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:15,210
I'm sorry. Tyson, what's a J2EE?

1227
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,260
Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition.

1228
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,710
-Do you not write code?    -Sorry.

1229
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,340
-This guy's the worst.    -Yeah.

1230
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,550
I'm actually more of a personal relations kind of guy.

1231
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,260
Like account management, client services. That kind of stuff.

1232
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,060
Dude, this kid is fucking awesome.

1233
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,690
Yes, Ned is grooming Scotty to take over our family business.

1234
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,560
-That's right.    -We own a printing business in Michigan.

1235
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,230
Really? I'm sure you're familiar
with those two siblings over there

1236
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,070
since you're in the printing business.

1237
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,570
Yo, brother-sister act! You gotta meet this guy.

1238
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,570
Hello!

1239
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,450
Hey! Blaine and Missy Pederman.

1240
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,740
Hi, I'm Barb Fleming.

1241
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,240
-This is my husband.    -Ned.

1242
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,870
I'm Scott Fleming. Nice to meet you.

1243
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,080
I'm sorry, we were told we might know you,
but I'm afraid we don't.

1244
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,750
Blaine and Missy started Stamp Free Invites.

1245
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,420
Oh, okay.

1246
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,760
Right.

1247
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
What's up?

1248
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,300
Did the server forget to send a reminder
for your birthday party or something?

1249
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,430
No, he is actually in the printing business.

1250
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,890
-Oh, shit.    -Whoops.

1251
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,640
No, no.

1252
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,100
We didn't put you out of business or anything?

1253
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:12,980
No.

1254
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,610
-What? Ruin our business?    -No, no.

1255
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,570
We're doing quite well. Thank you.

1256
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,980
-Oh, that's great!    -Good for you! Honestly, good for you.

1257
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,900
We love little mom-and-pop printers.

1258
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,990
-So inspirational. So important.    -Mm-hmm.

1259
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,620
My dad has more of a factory.

1260
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,990
Not to brag, but we're a pretty big shop.

1261
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,780
People need paper. They need something to write on.

1262
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,620
They love the feel of that card stock in their hands.

1263
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,620
Yeah.

1264
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,620
I've never heard anyone say that.

1265
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,630
-Hmm. We have not found that at all.    -Yeah. Nope.

1266
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,250
I think we come from two different worlds.

1267
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,460
Yes, we do.

1268
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:43,630
You better start learning code pretty fucking fast, dude.

1269
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,090
Dude, Ned was crushing it

1270
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,800
since before you two were fighting over your mother's titties.

1271
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,680
Our mom didn't breastfeed us.

1272
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,520
Laird, you know we had a wet nurse.

1273
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,680
Oh, I can tell.

1274
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,140
Boy, I'll tell you, I don't know what's going on.

1275
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,150
I'm lost.

1276
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,610
-I'm overwhelmed. Yeah!    -Me, too.

1277
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,650
There's bukkake floating all around me.

1278
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,860
-What?    -Hm?

1279
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,150
What's bukkake?

1280
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,360
Oh, Laird told me.

1281
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,320
It means when you're overwhelmed and you got too much going on.

1282
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,200
-Oh, my gosh.    -Can't figure things out.

1283
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,660
Then, I'm drowning in bukkake at this point.

1284
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,000
Okay, I'm gonna be real with you guys.
It means jizz on your face.

1285
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,500
I'm sorry?

1286
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,040
Bukkake means covered in jizz.

1287
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,380
Tons of jizz, ejaculate.

1288
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,960
Usually after a gangbang.

1289
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,340
Not as bad as it sounds.

1290
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,710
Yeah, post-gangbang.

1291
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,630
Or during. Depends if someone finishes early.

1292
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,050
-What the heck?    -I was trying to protect you, dude.

1293
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,850
-Protect me?    -Fucking Justine.

1294
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,140
You mean embarrass me?

1295
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,520
It was a really sensitive conversation.

1296
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,680
I didn't want to start talking
about guys jerking off on each other.

1297
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,190
Why'd you tell me it was overwhelming?

1298
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,520
Justine brought it up!

1299
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,190
I hope this is an opportune time to show a video.

1300
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,230
It's not.

1301
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,690
-Oh, God!    -Yeah.

1302
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,530
Oh, and this is a teaching moment.

1303
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,030
-Here's another.    -Oh, my God.

1304
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
-No. Scotty.    -Don't look at that.

1305
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,160
It's all good. You don't have to see this.

1306
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,870
Is that you?

1307
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,410
No.

1308
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,830

Hi, Pops.

1329
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,330
-I just need some fresh air.    -Can I come?

1330
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,750
We've always been straight with each other, haven't we?

1331
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920
Yeah, of course.

1332
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,470
Okay, I need to ask you a question. And I mean this honestly.

1333
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:30,840
Okay. What?

1334
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,140
-You're scaring me.    -No. It's just...

1335
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,350
What?

1336
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,640
Why Laird?

1337
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,140
-I mean, come on.    -Oh, my God.

1338
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,940
-Why?    -Dad.

1339
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,100
You are so smart and you're beautiful.

1340
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,480
You could be dating anyone. Why?

1341
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:46,940
-I don't get it.    -You want the truth?

1342
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,280
Yes.

1343
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,650
He kind of reminds me of you.

1344
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,160
What?

1345
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,490
-Me?    -Yes.

1346
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,450
Okay, I need you to explain that one.

1347
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,450
How?

1348
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,160
You're both the most honest and authentic men that I know.

1349
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,710
-It comes out in totally different ways.    -Oh, well...

1350
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,330
Laird has literally no filter.

1351
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,050
I don't know that to be true. Is that right?

1352
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,710
-Okay.    -Sorry.

1353
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,470
Trying to help you out here.

1354
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,840
But I swear his heart is always in the right place.

1355
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,350
He's a very good guy.

1356
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,850
And I love him.

1357
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,860
You love him?

1358
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,990
What?

1359
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,240
I'm processing.

1360
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,530
-We had the...    -Very funny, Dad.

1361
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,160
Okay. Okay.

1362
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,540
Just try to be cordial.

1363
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:45,750
I will. I'll try.

1364
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,580
-Okay? I'll try.    -Try to what?

1365
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,380
I'll try to just...

1366
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:55,050
...understand that person better.

1367
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,720
Come here.

1368
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:10,770
Hey.

1369
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,740
Hi.

1370
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,700
Long night. What are you doing?

1371
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,580
Just chilling.

1372
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,620
Barb, is that my shirt?

1373
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,710
I don't know, is it?

1374
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,420
Want me to take it off?

1375
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,130
Would you, please? I only brought two dress shirts.

1376
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:32,090
I really don't feel like ironing while I'm on this trip.

1377
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,550
I'm so exhausted.

1378
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,640
Oh, yeah.

1379
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,100
Take it off, baby.

1380
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,720
Yeah! Take it off. Take off those shoes, girl.

1381
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:47,140
Let me see those feet. I wanna see those feet!

1382
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,650
Did you hit your head or something?

1383
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:51,110
Yeah. Let me smell that shoe.

1384
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,230
-You don't wanna smell my shoe.    -Yeah, I want feet!

1385
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,440
I want those feet out of those socks.

1386
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,900
Barb, what happened to you?

1387
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,950
I am so stoned right now.

1388
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,070
What?

1389
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,330
Yeah, I am so baked.

1390
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,290
I am like super baked.

1391
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,620
Barb. What? Where did you?

1392
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,420
I was very lonely after you guys left.

1393
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,920
And I saw this guy, and he had a cigarette.

1394
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,510
I thought it was one of those electronic cigarettes.

1395
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,840
-They're called E-cigs.    -Yeah.

1396
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,800
But turns out...

1397
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,810
I was vaping.

1398
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,010
What?

1399
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,470
I was vaping.

1400
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
What is that?

1401
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,770
It's marijuana that comes out of some kind of machine.

1402
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,650
-Keep your voice down!    -Ned, it's legal.

1403
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,650
Oh, this poor boy had it for sleep apnea.

1404
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,650
-At his age? So sad.    -I'm going to bed. That's it.

1405
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,700
No, no, no. Wait!

1406
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,990
-Barbara, I'm tired.    -Wait a minute.

1407
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
And I've got a headache.

1408
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,330
-Let's play a little bit, huh?    -No, no.

1409
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,660
I'll give you one of my patented massages.

1410
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,620
Barb. Let's take the Little Cheese

1411
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,290
-out for a spin.    -No, no, no.

1412
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,830
-Come on, let me just see him.    -Don't.

1413
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,460
-I just want to see him.    -Don't call him that.

1414
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,710
Please. Come on.

1415
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,550
Oh, my God! You used to love getting high and fooling around.

1416
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,130
What? Barb! No, Barb.

1417
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,890
-We're on vacation!    -But someone could walk...

1418
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,510
There's no locks on the door!

1419
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,680
What?

1420
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,560
Justine! Do you have any Kiss?

1421
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,350
Oh, hell yeah!

1422
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,850
-Are you kids gonna do it?    -Yes.

1423
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,190
-No.    -We're doing it already.

1424
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,650
-We're doing it right now.    -Barb!

1425
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,070
I'm doing it with my feet. One foot.

1426
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,360
That's Kiss! Honey, you love Kiss!

1427
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,900
But not right now.

1428
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,370
Ned was made for loving Barb

1429
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,540
Yell!

1430
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1431
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,040
-Look what I learned at the party.    -What?

1432
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,170
There was this real cute girl, and she was going like this.

1433
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,050
She was doing this cute, new dance.

1434
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,890
You're gonna throw your back out.

1435
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,680
I'm not gonna throw my...

1436
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,930
I'll throw you out.

1437
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,680
-Let me get on you.    -Wait, do you smell that?

1438
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,430
-I'm putting him in.    -What is that scent?

1439
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,770
There. Oh, it's in.

1440
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,560
-What is that?    -Oh, my God.

1441
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,770
Oh, my God!

1442
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,900
Is that Indian Summer by Priscilla Presley?

1443
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,240
I used to wear that perfume in the 90s.

1444
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,240
Yup, pumping some in.

1445
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,120
I saw you mentioned it on your college reunion's Facebook page.

1446
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,910
I know what you like, Ned.

1447
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,950
Oh, I know you do, dawg.

1448
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,370
Yeah, get in there. Get it!

1449
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,040
-Barb!    -Get you some!

1450
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,960
-Get it! Good. Oh, that's...    -Okay.

1451
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,590
Yeah. You're almost in there.

1452
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,590
No, you're, like, six inches away from it.

1453
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,050
Get in there. Yeah, that's the spirit.

1454
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,760
-Barb.    -Oh! Yeah!

1455
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,930
-Barb!    -That's good.

1456
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,930
Oh, that's good. You're getting into it now.

1457
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,220
-That's it!    -No!

1458
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,470
-No, no!    -Take me! Yes! Take me!

1459
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,730
-I'm not...    -Take me.

1460
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,640
I'm taking you right to bed. That's what I'm doing.

1461
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,270
-Here you go. Yes.    -No, I wanna do sex.

1462
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,900
-We are not gonna do sex. No, honey.    -But I want to.

1463
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,440
-Justine, turn all the music off please...    -I wanna do it.

1464
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:42,990
...and leave us alone for the rest of the night.

1465
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,410
It's gonna be full penetration!

1466
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,780
Would you stop!

1467
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,620
Psst... Hey, girl.

1468
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,620
Fifth button from the right.

1469
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,290
You'll thank me later.

1482
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,560
Okay. You all right?

1483
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,220
Yeah. Oh, man.

1484
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,430
That's it.

1485
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,730
Dude, I thought I was gonna make it.

1486
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,390
I know. You almost did, but...

1487
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,400
Very good evasive parkour. Yes, but the last move you ate shit.

1488
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,690
I know.

1489
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,400
I'll put you on the table later and we'll do a little adjustment.

1490
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,420
Christmas tree shopping with the Big Cheese.

1491
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,760
Ned, you don't know how excited I am about this.

1492
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,880
I don't know if I ever mentioned this,

1493
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,090
but I never had a father to do this kind of stuff with.

1494
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,600
I'm glad we're getting a chance to hang out.

1495
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,640
That's nice.

1496
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,770
Uh, it's not getting me hard.

1497
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,060
You need an erection to buy a Christmas tree?

1498
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,650
Helps.

1499
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:27,940
I wanna get to know you better.

1500
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,440
I mean, you're so perfect.

1501
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,450
Seriously, did you always have your shit together?

1502
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:33,320
Oh, heck no.

1503
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,330
I got fired selling Datsuns.

1504
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,790
How'd you fuck up selling little dogs?

1505
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,960
No. Datsuns.

1506
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,920
-What's that?    -It's a car. Doesn't matter.

1507
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,340
It doesn't exist anymore.

1508
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,010
But you're still here.

1509
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:53,840
You ever get nervous about shifting tides?

1510
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:57,640
Well, you know, every business has its ups and downs.

1511
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,350
Yeah, I know it, bro.

1512
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,980
Guerrilla Gang, it's been struggling a little bit.

1513
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:04,150
Really?

1514
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:06,610
Yeah, it's just a fucking tough landscape, dude.

1515
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,530
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

1516
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,660
Chills. Did you come up with that?

1517
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,160
No, Laird.

1518
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,040
There she blows, Ned.

1519
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,210
It's our motherfucking tree.

1520
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,630
Why not? It'll look great opposite your moose.

1521
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,380
Ned, Ned. Not that one.

1522
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,010
That one.

1523
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,970
Oh, no. See, Laird...

1524
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,520
that doesn't belong to this lot.

1525
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
See, it's owned by...

1526
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,690
-Wet games?    -Wewt Games.

1527
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,650
Like, 'woot-woot'. I know those dudes. They're dicks.

1528
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,400
Tried to rip off Ape Assassins.

1529
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,820
Plus, it's the first Christmas with the family, dude.

1530
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,990
Gotta do it right.

1531
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,150
Hey, buddy.

1532
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,160
Yeah.

1533
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,660
Can I borrow that chainsaw?

1534
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,870
Are you serious?

1535
01:05:58,530 --> 01:05:59,530
Yeah.

1536
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
Fucking...

1537
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:04,040
Come on.

1538
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,880
Will you hurry up?

1539
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,540
I'm trying.

1540
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,050
Come on, guy. I need my chainsaw back.

1541
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:12,550
Just give me a second.

1542
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,380
Should we call an ambulance now, or wait till he loses a finger?

1543
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,550
Can I borrow those?

1544
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,680
Have at it.

1545
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,770
Okay. Laird just...

1546
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,060
Okay.

1547
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,020
Hand it over?

1548
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,890
-You sure, Ned?    -Yup.

1549
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,900
Total fucking Dad move!

1550
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,800

These guys are awesome!

1557
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,650
Stephanie and I do karaoke to Kiss all the time.

1558

Dude, I know, that's why I put it on!

1559
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,780
And we do a pretty good job, too,

1560
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,120

1561
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,240
-That's cute.    -Yeah.

1562
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,290
Listen, Laird, I've been thinking
about our teepee talk yesterday.

1563
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:30,960
Oh, dude, me too.

1564
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,960
I've got so many ideas for the proposal.

1565
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,960
-No. No.    -Ned, hear me out.

1566
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,300
I was thinking about getting the Goodyear blimp,

1567
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,680
-releasing a thousand doves.    -No. Wait.

1568
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,180
Laird, just hold on a second, okay?

1569
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,300
-Slow down.    -Okay.

1570
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,100
Look, I get it that Stephanie really likes you.

1571
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,270
-But...    -Uh-huh.

1572
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,640
-Look. Man to man.    -Yeah.

1573
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,360
Now is not the time.

1574
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,610
Dude, Ned, I thought we were getting past all that.

1575
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,150
No, it's not me.

1576
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,490
It's all about Stephanie.

1577
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,650
-Stephanie?    -Yes.

1578
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,820
I don't know, dude.

1579
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,990
These last few semesters are gonna be so intense.

1580
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,000
And then there's graduation, and she'll be looking for a job.

1581
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,660
And who knows where that will take her.

1582
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,370
-It's just...    -All right, Ned...

1583
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,540
I wasn't supposed to tell you this,
but I just wanna put your mind at ease.

1584
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,170
Stephanie is not going back to school next semester.

1585
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,840
What?

1586
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,970
Dude, I know you're probably shocked, but do not worry.

1587
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,520
She's already got this awesome job lined up at this non-profit.

1588
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:32,020
What organization is that exactly?

1589
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:36,860
She's going to be president of the Laird Mayhew Foundation.

1590
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,240
That's me.

1591
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,200
Stephanie!

1592
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,370
Barb?

1593
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,250
Everybody upstairs right now, family meeting!

1594
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,710
Ned, would you like me to schedule a meeting?

1595
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:52,870
Oh, fuck off!

1596
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,420
Just trying to help.
You don't always have to be such an asshole.

1597
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,840
Yes, I do!

1598
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,380
-Dad.    -You are so dead.

1599
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:02,010
Shut up. Of course I was going to tell you.

1600
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,680
I told Mom yesterday at the mall.

1601
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,720
I was just waiting for the right time to bring it up

1602
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,180
-and that hasn't happened.    -Wait a minute.

1603
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,060
You knew?

1604
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:12,390
Honestly, honey, we thought you might freak out.

1605
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,770
So we decided to wait until after Christmas to bring it up.

1606
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,940
But, okay, he told you about the foundation, right?

1607
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,860
-Yes.    -Yes, okay.

1608
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:24,450
This is a big part of why I wanted
you to come out here and meet Laird.

1609
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:28,950
Stephanie, even if he wasn't this abject lunatic,

1610
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,250
which he is,

1611
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:33,290
I still wouldn't understand why.

1612
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,210
You've only got a few semesters left before you graduate.

1613
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,090
Why would you just throw that away?

1614
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,420
I'm not throwing anything away, Dad.

1615
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:42,090
The year I spent in Central America doing this kind of work,

1616
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,430
I know you think that I'm making some rash decision

1617
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,600
and I'm not.

1618
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,100
We've spent months figuring it out.

1619
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,730
All the months where you didn't
even tell us you had a boyfriend.

1620
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:54,900
All those months?

1621
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,770
Darling...

1622
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,440
I think you should hear her out

1623
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,940
because it actually sounds very interesting.

1624
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:01,940
Does it?

1625
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:04,110
Are you willing to listen to me?

1626
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,280
Give it your best shot.

1627
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,780
The plan is to focus on women's health

1628
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,620
as a function of environmental change in the Third World.

1629
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,660
-Right.    -All right.

1630
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:14,080
And when all that goes belly-up,
you know what you're left with?

1631
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,290
-What?    -Being a college dropout.

1632
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,960
-That's it.    -You don't get it.

1633
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,130
Oh, I don't get it?

1634
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,960
No, you just, like, don't get it at all.

1635
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,800
Oh. What is that?

1636
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,430
It's a tattoo.

1637
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:26,970
With his name? You got a tattoo?

1638
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,100
You've marked your body with his name on it.

1639
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,350
Look at that, Barb!

1640
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:31,970
Oh, no.

1641
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,850
That is so cute.

1642
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,140
Let me see. I wanna see.

1643
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,190
Laird's been telling me I should get a neck tat.

1644
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:38,610
I see what Laird is doing here.

1645
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,610
I see what he's doing.

1646
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:44,150
He is trying to put his imprint on this entire family.

1647
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,450
And that is why we've got all these secrets now.

1648
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,990
And it's all because of him!

1649
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,030
Why do you have such a big problem with Laird?

1650
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,040
-Great question. You know why?    -Why?

1651
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,160
Because of his influence,

1652
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:56,670
you drop out of college.

1653
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:59,040
Because of his influence, you get a "too."

1654
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,340
Dad, I think you mean "tat."

1655
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,460
-You definitely mean "tat." I mean "tat?"
-It's not a "too?"

1656
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,630
-"Tat." No, it's not a "too."    -No.

1657
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,300
No, I saw it on Geraldo.

1658
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,220
-They call them "toos," okay?    -Okay.

1659
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,470
This is what's going to be your downward spiral.

1660
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,220
First you get a tattoo,

1661
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,010
then you start vaporizing.

1662
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,810
-What?    -You're vaporizing.

1663
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,520
What are you talking about?

1664
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,650
When you have... It's an e-cigarette.

1665
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:22,480
But instead of tobacco or a fake tobacco,

1666
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,360
no, you have marijuana in that e-cigarette.

1667
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:25,740
-Dad, I know what it is.    -Yeah.

1668
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,320
How do you know what it is?

1669
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:30,370
Because I've been around. Haven't I?

1670
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,200
Mm-hmm.

1671
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:36,080
Then you go from there to heroin. Mm-hmm, that's right.

1672
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,670
After that, after you get hooked on drugs,
you know what happens next?

1673
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,540
-What?    -You'll become a hooker, a prostitute...

1674
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,920
a pimp's bitch.

1675
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,750
That's what's going to happen to you.

1676
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,210
I see it very clearly.

1677
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,880
Oh, my... How long do I have?

1678
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,930
I'm glad you asked. Not long.

1679
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,220
You keep going down this path, at this rate, not long.

1680
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,890
You're clearly not in a place to listen to me right now.

1681
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,060
So I'm gonna go.

1682
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,560
Thank you, Pops, for the guidance.

1683
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,940
-Thank you.    -You're welcome.

Boss, let me get this straight.

1690
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,800
You want me to hack into Stephanie's boyfriend's computer

1691
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,130
and find out if there's any
record of him starting a foundation?

1692
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,300
Yes, I do.

1693
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:16,680
Listen, Kevin, you are my IT guy. I've got nowhere else to turn.

1694
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,140
You know I've always thought so highly of Stephanie.

1695
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,640
Yeah, she thinks a lot about you.

1696
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,690
Really? Oh, yeah.

1697
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,650
-That's so crazy.    -Now, listen.

1698
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,020
I know that this character has money,

1699
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,980
but there's something about this whole foundation

1700
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,490
that sounds like a bunch of hooey.

1701
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:34,030
If this guy's running hooey, then I'm gonna find out.

1702
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,030
Okay, first thing's first, Ned,
you have to break into his computer

1703
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,830
and download a program that I'm gonna send you.

1704
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,330
That's hacking?

1705
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,000
I took a shower, washing every body part...

1706
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,340
Yeah, okay. I'm getting online.

1707
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,010
-Kevin, what are you doing?    -Huh, baby?

1708
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,390
Oh, I'm helping Ned with something IT-related.

1709
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,850
Oh, tell Ned I said hi.

1710
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,010
Okay.

1711
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,010
All right, webcam's on.

1712
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,730
Okay, I'm in the office.

1713
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,850
All right, now get in front of the computer.

1714
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,900
All right, good. Press the spacebar.

1715
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,360
Oh, darn. It's asking for a password.

1716
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,360
No surprise.

1717
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:16,200
A lot of guys have passwords related
to their girlfriends or their wives.

1718
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,870
Kevin, you're a genius. That's what I have!

1719
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,870
It's "Barbsguy1989." The year we were married.

1720
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:26,370
The younger generation tends to go a little bit racier.

1721
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,710
I'm gonna get into some sensitive areas here,
so just bear with me.

1722
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,260
We need to focus on Stephanie's more defining qualities

1723
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,090
that this guy might latch onto.

1724
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,550
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1725
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,390
Would you just get to it?

1726
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,390
For example, like, would you say...

1727
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,520
Stephanie has perky breasts?

1728
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,390
-What?    -Okay.

1729
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,190
I would say yes, because she does.

1730
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,860
Please try "Stephanie's boobs" one word, no caps.

1731
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,070
I'm her dad!

1732
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:52,900
I understand that you're her dad,

1733
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,690
but you gotta think like him.

1734
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,900
Okay?

1735
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,700
No.

1736
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,450
We're gonna have to kick it up a notch.

1737
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,290
You said that this guy was edgy?

1738
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,590
Please try "Stephanie's tight ass." Give that a whirl.

1739
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,630
Are you messing with me, Dingle?

1740
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,720
I wish I was messing with you.

1741
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,090
I'm trying to help you, Ned.

1742
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,470
Make the two "S's" dollar signs in "ass."

1743
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,760
God!

1744
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,260
I am going straight to hell just for typing this.

1745
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,100
Tight ass.

1746
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,890
-No.    -Hey, guys?

1747
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:29,650
Do you wanna raise the volume on the movie?

1748
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:30,810
Okay.

1749
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,730
Okay. I'm just gonna list some off, you type them in.

1750
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,440
All right, try "Stephanie's sweet slit."

1751
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,610
I am not writing that!

1752
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,490
Okay, "Stephanie's pink canoe."

1753
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,660
No!

1754
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,990
Listen, this isn't fun for me.

1755
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,580
-Oh, my God.    -What is it?

1756
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,170
It's the password!

1757
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,340
The one piece of paper in the entire house.

1758
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,630
-What does it say?    -I'm gonna log it in.

1759
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,130
"Stephanie's dude."

1760
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,180
Aw, that's actually sweet.

1761
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,680
Boom! We're in.

1762
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,850
Oh, gosh!

1763
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,140
What? What is it?

1764
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,270
It's a nude photograph of Stephanie.

1765
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,980
-May I see it, please?    -No.

1766
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,140
May I please see it?

1767
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:10,770
-I said no!    -Okay.

1768
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,650
Go to your EarthLink account in the web browser.

1769
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,650
EarthLink, EarthLink, okay. Press.

1770
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,320
I give it my password.

1771
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:18,530
Okay.

1772
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:19,700
Okay. I just emailed you a file.

1773
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:22,950
Download that and open it on his desktop.

1774
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,830
-Ned, we're gonna fucking nail this guy!    -We're good!

1775
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,500
We're hacking, baby!

1776
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,870
We're gonna nail him.

1777
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,370
We're gonna nail him the way he's been nailing Stephanie.

1778
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,540
-Just come with me right now.    -What?

1779
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:35,340
Why are you taking me to my office?

1780
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,050
-Oh, shit! Someone's coming!    -Okay. Escape!

1781
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,510
Oh, God!

1782
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:41,300
Baby, what are we doing? Christmas Eve is about to start.

1783
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,180
-What is the matter with you?    -What's happening?

1784
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,680
-I specifically told you...    -Don't say anything.

1785
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,180
that I wanted to be the one to tell my dad about Stanford.

1786
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:50,180
-I know. We were just...    -Then why did you do it?

1787
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,690
We were bonding so hard, it just sort of slipped out.

1788
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:55,650
You clearly have no idea what this means to him.

1789
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,230
He was so proud of me when I got into Stanford.

1790
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,360
He worked so hard to make it happen.

1791
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:06,030
Me dropping out is like a huge slap in his face.

1792
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,870
Okay.

1793
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,250
I just never had anyone like him in my life before.

1794
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,870
Oh, my God!

1795
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,500
I thought we could just talk it out.

1796
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:17,250
You could see how that's not your place to do that, right?

1797
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,500
Okay. Maybe not.

1798
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:19,840
Definitely not.

1799
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,340
Okay, you're right. He was super pissed.

1800
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:28,220
Sometimes I feel like you're not
capable of being in a relationship.

1801
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:32,520
It's time that you get a handle on these father issues.

1802
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:33,730
Wow.

1803
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,400
That's the truth.

1804
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,440
When you call me on my shit...

1805
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:42,450
My God! It makes me feel so close to you.

1806
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:45,780
Your honesty has such an effect on me.

1807
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,450
You're making me so fucking horny right now.

1808
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,870
-What?    -Yeah.

1809
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,580
That face is boner-bait.

1810
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,710
Can you not see that I'm mad at you?

1811
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,040
Yeah, I see it. That's what's...

1812
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:59,710
Oh, my God. You're driving me crazy!
You're not listening to me.

1813
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:01,630
I'm listening.

1814
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,550
I'm sorry.

1815
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,800
Do you...

1816
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,640
You need therapy.

1817
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,310
-Not working.    -No?

1818
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,770
Mm-mm. Not today, buddy.

1819
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,310
Okay. How about this?

1820
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,060
Is this working?

1821
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,570
A little bit.

1822
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,440
Okay, how about this?

1823
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,660
Okay. That's working a little bit more.

1824
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,410
Laird, I love you.

1825
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,910
But I'm still mad at you.

1826
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,450
I'm sorry.

1827
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,670
-I'm so sorry.    -No, no!

1828
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,180
Okay?

1829
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,300
Yes!

1830
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:48,470
No!

1831
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,470
You...

1832
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,850
-I'm gonna make it up to you.    -What is happening?

1833
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,440
You just lie back,
and I'll give you an early Christmas present.

1834
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,650
You are such a freak.

1835
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:00,940
I know.

1836
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,860
Here comes Santa.

1837
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:06,990
Oh, really?

1838
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
-Ho, ho, ho.    -Oh, my God.

1839
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,530
Merry Christmas.

1840
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,330
Somebody's been naughty this year.

1841
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:17,830
Boss?

1842
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,210
Ned. Are you there? Hello?

1843
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,210
Hello? Oh.

1844
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,010
Yes. Kevin, I'm here. What's happening?

1845
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:25,130
I'm in.

1846
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,630
Do you have access to the Internet?

1847
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,180
Yes, I do. Hold on.

1848
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,640
Wait a second.

1849
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,390
Log into your EarthLink account.

1850
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:33,470
Okay. Got it.

1851
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,680
I'm gonna send these to you right now.

1852
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,810
-Good.    -You're done, Mayhew.

1853
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:41,360
What the fuck?

1854
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,820
-What happened?    -Oh, my God.

1855
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,320
Wait, what? What's going on?

1856
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,700
I don't know. He has my face.

1857
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,820
-What do you mean he has your face?    -I'm locked out.

1858
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,370
I can't use my computer anymore.

1859
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,410
-What?    -Stop that!

1860
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,910
-What's happening?    -He's onto us, Ned.

1861
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,040
What are you doing?

1862
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,750
We have to abort. Oh, God. Oh, no.

1863
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:01,170
Move back, motherfuckers Mayhew's here

1864
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:02,080
Oh, fuck!

1865
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,420
-He's a mythical creature, Ned.    -He's what?

1866
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:08,090
What the fuck? Oh, God.

1867
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,090
He's pulling out his penis!

1868
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,430
Oh, my God.

1869
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,510
He's balls deep in my digital butt.

1870
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,060
Are you watching porn?

1871
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,350
Turn that off!

1872
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,600
Ned, he's doing it!

1873
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,360
Marnie, it's not good!

1874
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:24,570
-Stay the fuck out!    -Turn that off!

1875
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,780
Kevin!

1876
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:26,900
Kevin!

1877
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,240
He has control of the house!

1878
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:33,450
Come here!

1879
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,280
-Kevin, what is happening?    -We gotta get out of here!

1880
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:36,410
Go, go, go!

1881
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,580
-What?    -Kevin!

1882
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,080
Kevin!

1883
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,880
Oh, my...

1884
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,640
Silent night

1885
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:01,520
Holy night

1886
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:05,690
All is calm

1887
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,530
All is bright

1888
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,490
-Hi.    -Hey.

1889
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,120
-You know what? Let's not fight.    -Okay.

1890
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,660
I'm sorry, truly, that you found out about Stanford that way.

1891
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,580
Thank you.

1892
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,710
It was not okay of Laird, and he knows that now.

1893
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,210
But I'm confident this is a really good idea.

1894
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:24,790
Honey, before you continue, I need to tell you something.

1895
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,590
Laird has been lying to you.

1896
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,170
I tried.

1897
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,760
-No, no, no. Hey!    -It's unbelievable!

1898
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,800
He is in serious financial trouble.

1899
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,760
-In what way?    -It's Christmas.

1900
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,140
Ned, you're making a mistake.

1901
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,600
He doesn't have enough money to finance his business,

1902
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,730
-let alone a foundation.
-What exactly makes you think that?

1903
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:43,190
Wait till you see this.

1904
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,480
-What's this?    -Here.

1905
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,560
Look at this, his own bank records.

1906
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,230
All in red.

1907
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,360
Is this for real?

1908
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,610
Yeah, it's true.

1909
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,360
Guerrilla Gang hasn't crushed one in a couple of years.

1910
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,070
So you lied to me?

1911
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,450
I'm dropping out of school

1912
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,870
to start a foundation that you're supposed to be financing.

1913
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,120
-Yeah.    -Yeah.

1914
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:04,370
Baby, the foundation is all good.

1915
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,290
What are you talking about?

1916
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,800
Ned, there has been a very big misunderstanding.

1917
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,920
These are only Laird's business holdings.

1918
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:14,090
On the personal side...

1919
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:17,220
I have put together a moderate,
conservative private equity sleeve

1920
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:19,260
that has been performing delightfully.

1921
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,020
-You could say that again.    -Mm-hmm.

1922
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,600
So you followed the Buffett rule?

1923
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:23,890
Always, dude.

1924
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,810
70/30, stocks to bonds.

1925
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
Buffet.

1926
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:27,860
Nice.

1927
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,150
-Your little hacker, Dingle...    -Hacker?

1928
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,980
...was worming down the wrong hole.

1929
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,570
-Does he mean Kevin Dingle?    -Probably.

1930
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,070
No, must be another Dingle.

1931
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,660
Only dingle I know of is the berries on the butt.

1932
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,620
Look, how much money do you have?

1933
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,830
-Babe, you don't have to answer this.    -Yes, he does.

1934
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,790
Fine! Full disclosure.

1935
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,170
It's bad.

1936
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,090
I'm down to my last 97 million.

1937
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,920
Laird.

1938
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,260
197 million.

1939
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:57,800
Boom.

1940
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:00,140
He's just barely scraping by.

1941
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,430
All you had to do was ask me.

1942
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,640
Gentlemen, I need Deck the Halls, allegro, now.

1943
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,890
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

1944
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,690
Ned, it's the holidays

1945
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,480
and I think we should start over.

1946
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:13,190
So this is for you.

1947
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,240
What is it?

1948
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,450
It's a little stocking stuffer. I think you'll like it.

1949
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:24,160
A phone? Press the button.

1950
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,920
This is from my bank in Grand Rapids.

1951
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,210
Merry Christmas.

1952
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,380
-Someone fill me in here.    -Well, Steph...

1953
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,090
I bought your father's company.

1954
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,800
Sort of.

1955
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,720
Ned, I purchased all your debt as a Christmas present.

1956
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,180
What the fuck?

1957
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,520
-You son of a bitch.    -What?

1958
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,770
Dude, I'm trying to be nice, so you can avoid bankruptcy.

1959
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,060
Are you guys talking Chapter 11?
I don't even wanna hear that term.

1960
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,940
Okay, gentlemen, I need Jingle Bells, and step on it!

1961
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:56,320
I can't believe that you didn't tell us about this.

1962
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,570
What? No, it's just...

1963
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,240
The business has been running a little rough lately.

1964
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,950
I'm already working on a new deal right now.

1965
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,040
-So you had no idea?    -No.

1966
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,410
How the hell did you know about this?

1967
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,000
It was Justine. Oh.

1968
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:10,080
Yeah, it was me.

1969
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,840
She played me back a little bit of
a conversation you had the other day...

1970
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
with a guy named Lou.

1971
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,630
Of course, I had to help.

1972
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,300
Ned, I'm sorry if I overstepped.

1973
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,130
Yep.

1974
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,510
But I was really, really worried about you.

1975
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,260
She was. No clowning.

1976
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,970
And just so you don't stress,

1977
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,480
you're still gonna be the Big Cheese, dude.

1978
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,560
I plan on being a very hands-off owner.

1979
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,110
So what do you say, partner?

1980
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:37,320
-Ned, what are you...    -What the fuck?

1981
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:39,360
Why would you do that, Dad?

1982
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:40,280
Dad!

1983
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:41,910
Fuck you, paper man!

1984
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,950
Oh, scheisse.

1985
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,120
Ned, I'm sorry, bro.

1986
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,870
Are you okay? Oh, man.

1987
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,330
My training, it just takes over.

1988
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,710
Everybody is feeling a lot of tension.

1989
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:52,710
-Calm down.    -Dad!

1990
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,380
Or we can hit people square in the face with an iPad.

1991
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,090
Disengage. Disengage and run!

1992
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,180
Dude, that was kind of cool. You gotta be honest.

1993
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,220
Ned, I love you. I was just trying to help.

1994
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,150
-Laird, disengage him!    -Ned, let go of his balls!

1995
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:19,360
Laird! Evasive parkour!

1996
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:20,610
Laird, get away!

1997
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:22,700
Evasive parkour! Do the wall pop!

1998
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:24,570
Wall pop!

1999
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,750
Goose! Did you see that?

2000
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,620
That's right! Because you finally engaged your core!

2001
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:33,790
Get down here!

2002
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,210
You see the difference of the feeling?
How it feels differently?

2003
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:37,750
I know!

2004
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:39,840
-Oh, my God!    -Oh, my God!

2005
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,720
-Don't breathe in. I'll save you, brother!
-Scotty, no! Scotty!

2006
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,840
No, honey!

2007
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,890
I'm here to save you, Laird!

2008
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,390
Scotty, watch out!

2009
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,860
Laird! You okay?

2010
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:04,030
Yeah!

2011
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,490
-Fantastic!    -You're okay.

2012
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,660
-You're okay.    -Wait. Where's Scotty?

2013
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,120
Scotty! Oh, my God.

2014
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:11,370
-Scotty!    -He's under the moose!

2015
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,830
He's under the moose!

2016
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,170
Scotty!

2017
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,250
Oh, shit.

2018
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,670
These fucking moose balls are in my mouth.

2019
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,880
Oh, shit, he's teabagging you, bro!

2020
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:23,340
I got you.

2021
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,180
Come here. Come here.

2022
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,020
Oh, my God. It's okay.

2023
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,190
It's okay.

2024
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:39,980
Honey, I'm so sorry it turned out this way.

2025
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:41,150
Me, too.

2026
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,940
I'll call you when I get home.

2027
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:45,110
Okay. Good luck with Scotty.

2028
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,370
-Thank you. I'll need it.    -Yeah.

2029
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:52,080
Steph, listen. I never...

2030
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,460
I'm done listening. Have a safe flight.

2031
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,630
-See you, sis.    -Bye, Scotty.

2032
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,960
Can't believe I have to go back to toilet paper.

2033
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,350
Hey, Don Millis. Merry Christmas, sir.

2034
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,350
You too, Ned. Look, I hate to call on Christmas.

2035
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,230
Oh, don't worry about that.

2036
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:19,150
It was great catching up yesterday

2037
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,520
and I wanted to ring you as soon as we made a decision.

2038
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:22,360
Okay.

2039
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,440
I talked with the group here about your proposal

2040
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:26,200
and we just can't go for it.

2041
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,660
I'm sorry, pal.

2042
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,530
We really appreciate you offering us such a sweetheart deal.

2043
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,160
But fact is we 're just not doing
a whole lot of printing these days.

2044
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:34,500
-You know how it is.    -Yes.

2045
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,750
-It's a whole new world, right?    -Yes.

2046
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,750
Sure is.

2047
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,580
I sure wish we could've done business, Cheese.

2048
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,170
All right, listen, um,

2049
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,710
if you're sure I can't change your mind there, Don.

2050
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,130
Yeah, unfortunately not.

2051
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,010
Okay. All right.

2052
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,220
-You have a happy holidays.    -You, too, Ned!

2053
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:52,810
Best to Barb and the kids.

2054
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:57,230
Excuse me, Ned?

2055
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:00,350

01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,500
Merry Christmas!

2072
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,830
Wow!

2073
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:06,750
Um, Lou, I texted you that I needed to talk to you.

2074
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:07,920
I mean, what's...

2075
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,090
Come on, you hear this guy?

2076
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,680
Hank Rouse from First National

2077
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,760
shot me a congratulatory voicemail
this morning about the Mayhew deal.

2078
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:16,930
You did it, Big Cheese!

2079
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:19,930
You pulled off the Christmas miracle.

2080
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,060
-Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!    -Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!

2081
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:25,310
Barb!

2082
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,360
Scotty.

2083
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,240
Ned, as a little token of our appreciation,

2084
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,860
we all chipped in and bought you something

2085
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:35,660
that we're pretty sure you don't own.

2086
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,790
You shouldn't have.

2087
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,460
Open it. Yeah.

2088
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,210
Yeah, right there.

2089
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:46,670
It's an iPad.

2090
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,170
Hit the home button right there.

2091
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:50,380
Yeah.

2092
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,630
We had a little fun with that down in Graphics.

2093
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,970
I got the images off Scotty's Facebook page.

2094
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:01,480
He looks like a stand-up guy.
Like a younger version of you, Ned.

2095
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,190
Make a speech!

2096
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,690
Speech! Oh, yes, speech!

2097
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,230
Speech, speech, speech.

2098
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,990
The heck is that?

2099
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,450
Laird, a jet and a helicopter? Where are we?

2100
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,120
Hang on, babe. Almost there.

2101
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,260
-One second.    -Mayhew!

2102
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,470
-Guys, stay here for a minute.
-Honey, go inside and get a jacket.

2103
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,680
-That's Mayhew.    -Is that the guy?

2104
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:38,760
Laird!

2105
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,100
Where are we?

2106
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,640
That looks weird. It's kind of Fifty Shades of Grey-ish.

2107
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,640
-Cold?    -Yeah.

2108
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,440
And here we go.

2109
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,530
Surprise!

2110
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,570
Hi, honey.

2111
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,070
Ta-da.

2112
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,200
-You brought me home?    -Yeah.

2113
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:03,000
Without telling me?

2114
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,420
I realize I violated the sanctity of mystery date

2115
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:09,500
but I just thought the family should all be together today.

2116
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,380
Okay, that wasn't your place to do that, hon.

2117
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,380
Steph, I know,

2118
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:14,970
but it is Christmas.

2119
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:17,430
-And we're glad to see you.    -This isn't what she wanted.

2120
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:18,510
No, it's not.

2121
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,720
What I wanted was for us to
spend Christmas in California together

2122
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,310
like I planned, before everything went to shit

2123
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,230
because you made it all about yourself.

2124
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,400
Mm-hmm.

2125
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,270
You both did.

2126
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,690
-I did?    -Yes!

2127
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,820
You idiots think you can pass me back and forth

2128
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,900
like I'm your property or something?

2129
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,820
I'm done.

2130
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,450
This is the worst Christmas ever.

2131
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,370
-Steph. Steph.    -Honey.

2132
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:47,460
I think she's pissed.

2133
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,250
Yeah, she's pissed.

2134
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:53,250
Shit!

2135
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:57,630
I just thought that you guys should be together today.

2136
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,260
All right. Well, I'll leave you to it.

2137
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,560
Happy holidays, Ned.

2138
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,020
You too, Laird.

2139
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,650
Uh, Laird.

2140
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:17,320
You're doing a "I'm gonna walk away slowly "
'cause I really don't wanna leave" walk.

2141
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,110
Maybe.

2142
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,490
Come here.

2143
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,830
Come here.

2144
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:26,910
So what happened? You didn't propose?

2145
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,160
How could I?

2146
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,330
I never got your permission

2147
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,330
and we pinky-swore I wouldn't ask without it.

2148
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:35,250
You are remarkable.

2149
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,800
You don't have a gear to be dishonest, do you?

2150
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,970
Guess not, dude.

2151
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:48,100
Laird, you never needed my permission
to ask Stephanie to marry you.

2152
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,940
But if it still means anything to you,

2153
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,480
you have my blessing.

2154
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,280
For reals?

2155
01:32:58,820 --> 01:32:59,820
No clowning.

2156
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:02,450
Whoa.

2157
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,620
But, Laird, Stephanie's right.

2158
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,120
It's up to her. It's always been up to her.

2159
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,210
Not us.

2160
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:14,170
It just took me a while to realize that.

2161
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,630
It's so true.

2162
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,050
Dude, we were such jerks.

2163
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,420
Yeah.

2164
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:21,800
I bit your dick.

2165
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,970
Shaft and balls. Oh.

2166
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,600
I'm sorry.

2167
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:29,850
I'm sorry, too, dude.

2168
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:33,060
Look, Laird, if you wanna ask Stephanie to marry you

2169
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:35,310
when the time is right, just do it.

2170
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,940
Okay. Is it cool if I do it right now?

2171
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:41,360
Because, uh, just in case it worked out

2172
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:44,570
I had Goose put a shit ton of doves in the helicopter

2173
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,200
and I have a couple other surprises.

2174
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,790
Laird, this is totally your call.

2175
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,910
But can I give you some advice?

2176
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,580
Dude, please.

2177
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,420
-I'm so fucking nervous right now.    -All right, look...

2178
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:58,090
Stephanie doesn't care about all the bells and whistles.

2179
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,880
You know her.

2180
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:01,420
She cares about you.

2181
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:03,010
She loves you.

2182
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,350
So you get down on one knee

2183
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,640
and you speak to her from your heart.

2184
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,140
That's what you're best at.

2185
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,770
Isn't that right, Justine?

2186
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,320
Totally agree.

2187
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,860
Holy shit.

2188
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:23,150
My first time in Michigan. It's cold as balls here.

2189
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:25,200
Yeah.

2190
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,700
Dude, that's fucking great!

2191
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:29,660
Do it Ned Fleming style.

2192
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,410
Old school!

2193
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:32,660
Fuck yes.

2194
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,540
Okay. Well, look...

2195
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:38,590
I'll go in there and see if I can get her to come out.

2196
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:39,710
Okay.

2197
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,550
-Good luck.    -Thanks.

2198
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:47,050
Hey, promise me one thing.

2199
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,890
You will treat her well.

2200
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:54,390
Dude, I'm gonna treat her like a motherfucking queen.

2201
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:57,440
I'll take that.

2202
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,610
Okay.

2203
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:02,650
Gustav, change of plans.

2204
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:05,490
We're go on the proposal. No go on all that other shit.

2205
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:08,120
I have only one bar. You're saying we are a go, yes?

2206
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,830
No. No go.

2207
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:12,040
Go on the proposal, no go on the shit.

2208
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,120
Laird, are you saying it's a no go

2209
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,460
or are you saying, "No. Go."?

2210
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,620
God damn it, Goose.

2211
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,420
You're making me fucking nervous. Just shut up.

2212
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,170
Oh, I'm sorry. Good luck.

2213
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,670
Oh, and by the way, please, Laird, breathe.

2214
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:27,590
Okay.

2215
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,760
And no cursing, okay?

2216
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,510
Fuck, you're right. Good call.

2217
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:34,390
Hi.

2218
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:38,770
I'm sorry.

2219
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,900
I know that out in California I disappointed you

2220
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,990
and that kills me.

2221
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:46,780
And I'm really sorry.

2222
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,240
I'm sorry, too.

2223
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,910
I threw you in the deep end out there.
I should've never asked you to come.

2224
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,080
Honestly. No.

2225
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,670
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

2226
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:01,250
-What was I thinking?    -It was me.

2227
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,670
It's just that, when we got out to Laird's...

2228
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:09,010
I just didn't feel like I knew you anymore

2229
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,680
and I got scared.

2230
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:15,100
I just went crazy.

2231
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:19,100
This is me.

2232
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,020
I'm doing good.

2233
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:26,030
Oh, Dad.

2234
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,200
Oh, my God.

2235
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,790
Okay, look. I forgot...

2236
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:37,040
-Oh, God. He's still out there.    -I know.

2237
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,330
In a tank top and a scarf.

2238
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,710
And he knew we were coming to Michigan.

2239
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:43,380
-Why doesn't he just come inside?
-He has to talk to you about something...

2240
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:46,050
He has to talk to you about something...
He kind of wants to make things right with you.

2241
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,630
-Oh, does he?    -Yeah.

2242
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,880
I think it'd be cool if you gave him a chance.

2243
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,140
You want me to give Laird a chance?

2244
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:59,060
I thought that if you saw fit to give him a chance...

2245
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,900
I thought that it'd be cool.

2246
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:05,230
That's all. Well?

2247
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,070
-Hi.    -Hey.

2248
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:09,190
What's going on? Oh, my God, it's cold out here.

2249
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,490
I know you're pissed, but just hear me out.

2250
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,070
-Can we talk inside?    -No.

2251
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,200
-Oh, my...    -Look.

2252
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,990
Oh, my God. It's so romantic.

2253
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,750
-I told him to keep it simple.    -Oh, our little girl.

2254
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:21,920
He's gonna get down to his knee and keep it real simple.

2255
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,330
How do you know all this?

2256
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,250
I gave him a few pointers. Oh.

2257
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,090
This has been the happiest year of my life.

2258
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:34,180
And fly! Go, go, go! Go!

2259
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,520
Oh, my God.

2260
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:46,770
Goose. God damn it. I said no go! No go!

2261
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,030
-Oh, my...    -Oh, gosh. Wow.

2262
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,110
-Why did he do that?    -Smart boy.

2263
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,280
Absolute fucking shit fest.

2264
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,070
Babe, I'm so sorry. Uh...

2265
01:37:58,290 --> 01:37:59,790
Stephanie Fleming...

2266
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,620
-will you...    -Are you proposing?

2267
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,620
Yeah.

2268
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,920
Mmm-hmm. Did my dad know about this?

2269
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:10,710
Yeah, I asked for his blessing that first morning back in Cali.

2270
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:11,880
Oh, my God.

2271
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,380
Oh, my God!

2272
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:17,050
No wonder he acted so crazy. Honey.

2273
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,140
Yeah, that's why he was a little out of whack.

2274
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,390
Yeah, we could have had a really nice holiday.

2275
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,310
I know. But we're all good now. Okay?

2276
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,610
This is a lot.

2277
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,480
-Oh, my God.    -Stephanie Fleming...

2278
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:30,650
That's a ring.

2279
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:33,990
Goose! No!

2280
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,620
And, go! Go, guys! Go, go, go!

2281
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:42,790
Stephanie!

2282
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,170
Oh, my God.

2283
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:00,470
Laird, what is Kiss doing here?

2284
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,430
Um, well...

2285
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:05,640
-Is that...    -Whoa!

2286
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:07,020
He got look-a-likes!

2287
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:10,480
Those aren't look-a-likes, Ned. That's Gene and Paul.

2288
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:13,610
It's Gene and Paul! Gene and Paul!

2289
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,860
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

2290
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:17,360
Kiss is in the front yard!

2291
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:20,030
Tonight

2292
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,660
I wanna give it all to you

2293
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:25,540
In the darkness

2294
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,380
Originally, I had this more elaborate proposal plan

2295
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:31,500
but your dad gave me this awesome
advice and told me not to do it.

2296
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:35,050
But they're here,
and I know how much you love their music, so...

2297
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,510
What? Hi.

2298
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:40,390
I was made for lovin' you, baby

2299
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:44,350
You were made for lovin' me

2300
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,350
And I can't get...

2301
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,730
Is he still proposing? What's...

2302
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:53,360
They've stopped playing now.

2303
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,400
-His name's Ned.    -Oh, my God, are they...

2304
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:56,650
What?

2305
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:58,070
-Are they coming in the...    -Oh, my God.

2306
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,660
-They're coming up the sidewalk!    -They're heading in!

2307
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,330
-They're coming in our house!    -Oh, my God!

2308
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:03,410
Everybody act natural! Act naturally!

2309
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,160
I have to redecorate the house!

2310
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,340
Hey.

2311
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,550
Hi.

2312
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,760
Hi.

2313
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,010
Uh, hi.

2314
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,680
-I'm Ned.    -Hey, Ned.

2315
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,060
-Hi!    -Hi!

2316
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,770
This is my wife, Barb.

2317
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,350
This is our friends, Lou and Patty.

2318
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,600
It's Lou.

2319
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,190
So excited you're here.

2320
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,610
I gotta tell you. Uh, we are huge fans.

2321
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:40,450
We've been members of the Kiss Army for, like, 30 years now.

2322
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:43,280
Yeah. Our first date was the Crazy Nights Tour.

2323
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:45,910
Yeah! And, boy, was that crazy.

2324
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,040
Crazy.

2325
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:48,790
Did you get laid?

2326
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,880
I gave him a handjob.

2327
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,470
Scotty.

2328
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,050
I'm having an awesome time, but are you having a buffet here?

2329
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,800
Oh, my God. What was I thinking?

2330
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,390
-Are you hungry?    -Starving.

2331
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,310
Oh, God, of course! Where's our manners?

2332
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,390
We're terrible hosts.

2333
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,980
Let's get those guitars, guys. Come on, let me get that axe.

2334
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,310
-See my body?    -Wow! Kiss is in our house!

2335
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,650
Yeah. I'm kind of juiced up a little bit.

2336
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,990
Oh! I almost forgot about them.

2337
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,990
-Well...    -The happy couple.

2338
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,570
Congratulations.

2339
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,410
She said no.

2340
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,330
I'm sorry, what?

2341
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:28,790
She said no.

2342
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,660
Well...

2343
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:34,500
Honey.

2344
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,800
I'm so flattered

2345
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,960
that you wanna marry me

2346
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:40,420
but I'm not ready for that.

2347
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,350
And I'm gonna finish school.

2348
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:46,810
For me.

2349
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,430
Because that's what I wanna do.

2350
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,100
Got it?

2351
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:51,940
That's really smart.

2352
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,850
It's just, I had this big plan

2353
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,270
and it didn't work out.

2354
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:00,190
Yeah. Well, that's life, pal.

2355
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,860
That is so well put, Ned.

2356
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,330
It's really, really smart.

2357
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:09,160
Dude, did you come up with that?

2358
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:10,950
The words, "That's life?"

2359
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,790
Ned, you're so full of practical wisdom...

2360
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:17,040
I was just really looking forward to you being my father-in-law.

2361
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,210
I'm not breaking up with you.

2362
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:22,380
You're not?

2363
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:23,550
No, honey.

2364
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,050
No, no, no. I'm still your girlfriend.

2365
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,970
We're still together.

2366
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:30,640
Oh, thank God!

2367
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,890
Come here.

2368
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,030
Merry Christmas.

2369
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,070
-Ned.    -Hey.

2370
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,870
Dude, your employees are so cool.

2371
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:48,240
Yeah, they are.

2372
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:50,580
Maybe it was wrong of me to interfere like that,

2373
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,580
but why don't you let me save your company?

2374
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:55,670
No, Laird, I can't.

2375
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:57,830
That old model doesn't work anymore.

2376
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,920
I guess... I don't know.

2377
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:01,880
I guess I just didn't want to believe it.

2378
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,380
But since you mentioned it...

2379
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:06,680
I do have a business idea I wanna run by you.

2380
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,430
Dude, elevator pitch me!

2381
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,760
Okay.

2382
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,430
No, hold on.

2383
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,930
This wasn't my idea at all. One second.

2384
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,850
-Scotty, come here.    -Yo, what's up?

2385
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:17,850
-Come here.    -Yeah?

2386
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:20,940
I want you to tell Laird about the
business idea you mentioned on the plane.

2387
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:22,110
-Go ahead.    -Wait, really?

2388
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,070
Yeah.

2389
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:24,900
Told you to get that seat at the table, bro.

2390
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,610
You did. He told me, Dad. He was, like...

2391
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,120
"You're gonna get that seat."
I can't believe I finally got the seat.

2392
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,530
Dragons and titties, baby.

2393
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:32,080
Dragons and titties!

2394
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,120
Breathe that fire.

2395
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:35,290
Get up in there.

2396
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:38,120
Get up in those titties!

2397
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:39,290
Gonna get those dragons.

2398
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,380
Dad...

2399
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:43,380
Scotty!

2400
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:46,130
Stop motorboating your dad, and elevator pitch me.

2401
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,130
Sorry. Uh...

2402
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:50,890
Laird, I can't stop thinking about your toilets, dude.

2403
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,760
-My toilets?    -Yeah.

2404
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:54,600
The fresh feeling, the scented talc.

2405
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,940
I was thinking if you can get the controls in English

2406
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,770
and maybe lower the price point a little bit,

2407
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,940
we could have a potentially untapped

2408
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:02,770
-Oh, shit.    -Right?

2409
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:05,650
-And look, we can contact a Japanese manufacturer about pricing...
-Ooh.

2410
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:08,150
-No, Scotty. Pardon my French, but fuck that noise.    -Whoa.

2411
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,950
Whoa. Listen. We have a factory right here in Grand Rapids

2412
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,290
with 37 of the best employees you're ever gonna want.

2413
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:17,330
Let's build our own.

2414
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:20,330
-Hells yes, Grateful Ned!    -Yeah!

2415
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:21,830
Boom!

2416
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,090
Okay, sorry. Yeah.

2417
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:35,520
The first noel the angels did say

2418
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:41,020
Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay

2419
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:46,690
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

2420
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:52,370
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

2421
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:54,160
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

2422
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,160
It turned out to be a pretty cool holiday after all, huh?

2423
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,120
It did, son.

2424
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,040
Dude.

2425
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:03,540
What?

2426
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,550
Told you you'd be calling me "son" by Christmas.

2427
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,300
That's just a figure of speech.

2428
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:10,550
Sure, Dad.

2429
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:25,480
♪ Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight ♪

2430
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,870
Hello there, you gang! It is I, Gustav.

2431
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:36,240
It's so great to see you!

2432
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:39,040
Hey, what do you think of the new facial hair, huh?

2433
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,040
I'm based in Michigan now, so you know...

2434
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,750
I'm trying to do this whole kind of Paul Bunyan,
Midwestern thing.

2435
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,000
I wanted to fill it all out.

2436
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:48,420
So Scotty, Laird, and Ned took the printing company...

2437
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,420
turned it into a toilet factory...

2438
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,090
and it's going great!

2439
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,430
The toilet is water efficient und eco-friendly.

2440
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:56,010
It's state of the art.

2441
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,510
I'm telling you, they have invented the Tesla of toilets!

2442
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,020
It's amazing.

2443
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:04,940
Barbara has made sure that each toilet
has a state of the art vaginal cleanse.

2444
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:09,400
You know exactly what I'm saying.

2445
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:12,570
Every single model comes with Justine.
Talk about a smart toilet.

2446
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,740
She knows if you need a little sploosh

2447
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:16,070
or if you actually need the fountains of the Bellagio up there.

2448
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,200
Scotty has finally got his seat at the table.

2449
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:22,290
It's beautiful.

2450
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:25,960
He went a little too far with the dragons,
and the titties, and the motorboating.

2451
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:28,380
Oy vey.

2452
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,460
Oh, Miss Stephanie.

2453
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:33,050
She had the idea to link the Fleming-Mayhew company

2454
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,970
with the new foundation.

2455
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:39,970
So now, they're sponsoring sewage
projects all over the Third World. I told you.

2456
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,560
Smart, smart, smart girl.

2457
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:45,650
So, things are working out really well for the gang here.

2458
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:48,270
The company is a smashing success.

2459
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:52,280
And my dear Laird has finally gotten what he's always wanted.

2460
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,400
To be part of a family.

2461
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,120
All right, ciao for now, you friends.

2462
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:04,080
