1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,037
Hey, babe.
So happy to see you!

2
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,232
Hi! I got your flowers.
That was so sweet of you.

3
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,960
Of course.
Well, I know you're finishing

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,433
your Global Health
paper today

5
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,176
and you've been working
really hard on it.

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,193
Well, I'm almost done,
so, maybe

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,797
you want to come over
and Netflix and chill and...

8
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
What?

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,198
You mean you want to fuck?

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,237
I did not say that!

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,435
Oh, my God!
I know.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,120
No! I was being
more subtle than that!

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I know. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,555
Yes, I am so down for that.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,438
It's been like
three fucking days.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
My balls are
so blue right now,

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,793
like dark blue,
Uh-oh.

18
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,949
Like almost black.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,076
No, I'm fucking serious.
Here, check it out.

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,589
I believe you.
I believe you.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Okay.

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,831
I'll see your
almost-black balls later.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Cool, Steph.

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,076
Come over any time after 6:00.
Okay, hun?

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,117
Okay. Dude,
we are going to Netflix

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,873
and chill this shit so hard.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,077
Peaky Blinders. Kimmy Schmidt!

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,593
Movember's over.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,554
Time to shave the pornstache.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,514
Sorry. Making a Murderer!

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,119
Narcos!

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,033
Stranger Things!

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,555
Black balls!

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,556
Anyways,
Ned followed his dreams

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,517
and turned a run-down
old printing press

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,953
into the industry
powerhouse

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,156
known today
as the Fleming Company.

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,976
Best boss in the world!

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,036
The Fleming Company!

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,394
We're talking

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,551
brochures for
Steelcase furniture,

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,876
half the specialty jobs
in Grand Rapids

43
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,555
and who could forget
the Domino's Pizza circular?

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,831
But before all that...

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,151
Ned met a young Michigan
Wolverine, Barbara Welsh.

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,032
How did this
older guy get me?

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,715
Ned took her on their first date
to see his favorite band...

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,997
Kiss!
Kiss!

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,434
My favorite band, too!

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,828
Rock and roll!

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,353
A few years later,

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,715
the stork brought
my sister, Stephanie.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,199
Aw!

54
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,032
She's so cute.

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,871
They weren't close at all.

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,395
Oh, dropping her off at school.
Yeah.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,119
Then came me, Scotty F.

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,349
Did we have another child?

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,456
I forgot about that second baby.
Oh, we had another child.

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,629
Anyways, Big Cheese.

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
I'm sorry, guys.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,911
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,353
Aw...

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,072
But I love you, Dad.
Happy Birthday.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,195
Way to go, Scotty!

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,793
I love you, too, buddy.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
Thank you. Wow!

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,472
That was fantastic.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,440
We've got
one last surprise for you.

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
That's right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,752
live from her dorm room
at Stanford...

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,751
it's my sister, Stephanie!

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,679
Hi, everyone!
Hey, honey!

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,592
Hey, Steph!
Hey, it's Kevin!

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,352
Hi, Kevin!
Kevin.

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,317
Can we see?
Sorry.

77
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,198
Hi, Momma.
Hi!

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,395
Hi, Dad.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,754
The birthday boy.

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,955
Hey, honey.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,871
You guys look like
you're having so much fun.

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,519
And I wish I could
be there with you.

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,278
She's so sweet.

84
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,759
Yeah.
Get out.

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,036
Yeah, I just wanted to say,
Dad, that I love you.

86
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,519
I love you, too, honey.

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,908
I love you more.
No, you don't.

88
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
Love you to the moon
and back.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,072
I'll let you win this round.
Okay, Pops?

90
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,317
Even though you're now like...

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,675
...ancient.

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,159
You are still...

93
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
What are you doing here?

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,993
You asked me
to come over.

95
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,696
You're early.
I said after 6:00.

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,896
All right.
Give me a sec,

97
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,016
- I'm on the phone.
- Got it.

98
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,296
Sorry.
It's just my friend. Anyway.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,676
Happy birthday to you

100
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,836
Oh, my goodness.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,115
Oh, Laird, what are you...

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,336
Go finish your call.

103
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm just getting ready
to Netflix and chill, baby.

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
No, not now, Laird.
Oh, my goodness.

105
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Kimmy Schmidt!

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,176
Pull up your pants.
Marco Polo.

107
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,918
Oh, my God!

108
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
How do you make it stop?

109
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,096
Whoa, whoa, Mom,
you just took a screenshot.

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,475
Happy, happy birthday
Happy, happy birthday

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,696
Kevin, help her out. Kevin.

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,790
Happy birthday, happy birthday

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,628
Mi oh my,
it's a wonderful life

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,510
It's a wonderful life
with you by my side

115
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,195
Mi oh my,
it's a wonderful life

116
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,990
It's a wonderful life
with you by my side

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,816
Hey, there he is.
Happy birthday, Big Cheese.

118
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Thanks, Jim.

119
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,713
Jerry.
Hey, Ned.

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,936
Fun dinner last night.
Hey, Jerry.

121
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Thanks. Lou.

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,360
Hey, Cheese,
can I have a minute?

123
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,232
Sure. Good morning, Joyce.

124
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,839
Great party.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,638
Hold all his calls.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,513
You gotta
be kidding me.

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,432
Big Lots is
bailing out on us?

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,318
We've had that account
since '06.

129
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,277
They're moving all their
print work to China.

130
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Oh, God.

131
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,398
Cheese, we're already getting
pummeled by Evite, Stamp-Free

132
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,959
and the rest of those
dot-coms.

133
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,634
And at this rate,
we'll be Chapter 11 by March.

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,080
What about
Dick's Sporting Goods?

135
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,118
Well, I mean, I'm still
trading calls with my guy.

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,236
But, Ned,
can I be honest with you?

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't keep this
from Patty much longer.

138
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,874
Lou, haven't I
kept us going?

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,795
Yeah. I mean,
it's what you do.

140
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,554
I just need a little
more time. That's all.

141
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,711
You are the maestro.

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,075
Maybe you'll pull off
a Christmas miracle.

143
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,549
Yeah.
Yeah.

144
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,915
By the way, good job keeping
that game face last night.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh. Thanks.

146
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,399
That was some
shindig, man.

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Yeah, it was fun.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,152
Well, till the kid
had his farter

149
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,673
all over the screen
in 3-D.

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,989
I was like, "Whoa!

151
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
"That's a lot, man."

152
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
And get this...

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,358
Stephanie now wants us
to fly out...

154
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,159
to meet the man behind the
crack over the holidays.

155
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,760
With everything
that's going on here,

156
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,096
that's the last thing
I want to do.

157
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,439
Well, hold on now.

158
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,158
This is the first
serious boyfriend?

159
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,391
Yeah. Apparently.

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,639
I mean, it's so strange.

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,031
I mean, Stephanie and I
have always been so close.

162
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,919
And yet she has never even
mentioned this guy.

163
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,354
That's the way
it goes, Cheese.

164
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,915
I thought I knew everything
about Lou Junior,

165
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,280
when he was down
at Ohio State.

166
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,789
Out of nowhere,

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,757
he comes dragging home
this Buckeye

168
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,753
that he's been dating
for over a year.

169
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,319
No.
Yeah.

170
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,153
Nice girl, but still.
She's so controlling.

171
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,318
I'm sorry.
I don't mean it like that

172
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,879
because I don't know her
that well.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,274
But I don't like her.

174
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,668
I don't.
Lou.

175
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,353
It's just what happens,
you know?

176
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,476
Lou, what is the point
of all this?

177
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,199
Go out there and meet him.

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,271
I know we going through
a lot right now

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,830
but hell, Lou Junior is talking
about getting married in May.

180
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Married.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,070
Once they're not
under your roof,

182
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,191
there's no telling
what they're into.

183
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,793
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

184
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,336
He does want you
to speak at the wedding

185
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,669
and say some kind words.
Oh.

186
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,195
I told him that I would
talk to you about it.

187
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
And they'd like to get married
at your house in the backyard.

188
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,031
Well...
But anyway...

189
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,313
I'm just saying you might want to
get out there and meet this kid.

190
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,708
Because, I mean,
you saw it.

191
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,155
You saw it,
he's a free spirit.

192
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
You mean...

193
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,593
You heard him
come into the room.

194
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,512
He came in there guns blazing.

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,752
He had that revved up energy
where he was like...

196
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,075
bow-bow-bow-bow.

197
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,390
He just wants to go
and go and go...

198
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,710
and just morning,
noon and night,

199
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,199
and "Stephanie, here I am.

200
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,920
"Stephanie, here I come.
I'm coming again."

201
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,672
I remember being that age,
don't you?

202
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,159
Just always ready.

203
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,016
Come on, it's lovely weather

204
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,235
For a sleigh ride
together with you

205
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,314
Thanks for coming.

206
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,716
Oh, gosh,
it is so gorgeous here.

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,030
I'm very excited that you
guys are all out here.

208
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
We're very excited.

209
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,096
There's a few things that
I wanna tell you about Laird

210
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,032
that I didn't feel like getting into
over the phone because...

211
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,348
Watch, honey...

212
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,949
You missed our exit.

213
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,496
Actually,
I missed it on purpose.

214
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,953
Laird and I thought,

215
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,670
it'd be better if we all
stayed at his house.

216
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,795
His house?

217
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
When did this come up?
Did you know about this?

218
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,071
Are you sure
his parents have enough room?

219
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,616
I mean, he doesn't
live with his parents.

220
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,029
Honey, we're not gonna be
comfortable at some crash pad.

221
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,589
He lives by himself.
It's not a crash pad,

222
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,318
but it's much nicer
than the Sheraton.

223
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,913
Nicer than
the club floor?

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,399
I smooth-talked the manager.

225
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,516
We got a suite
at the regular rate.

226
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,636
What? That's what
I'm talking about, Big Cheese.

227
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,438
That is impressive.
We have to turn back.

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,192
Free continental breakfast.
Yes.

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,736
Mint on the pillow,
turndown service,

230
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,056
all things available
at the Sheraton.

231
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,536
I mean, is your lover
going to have that?

232
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,790
Your lover? Your lover?

233
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,956
We already all know
that you've seen his penis.

234
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,109
What?
Scott!

235
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
What?

236
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,476
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening

237
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,948
Well, this is cute.

238
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,872
Actually,
this is the gatehouse.

239
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,595
Gatehouse?

240
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,917
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What the heck?

242
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,310
Is that
a facial recognition scanner?

243
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,555
Mmm-hmm.

244
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,834
That's so cool.

245
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,433
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird

246
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,158
The hedge is moving.

247
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,114
He sings a love song
As we go along

248
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,714
Walking in a winter wonderland

249
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,917
Honey, who exactly
are you dating?

250
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,976
Laird started this company
called Guerrilla Gang.

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,399
You play Ape Assassins,
right?

252
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,754
Are you kidding me?

253
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,256
Yeah, that was my jam
in the eighth grade.

254
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Great, that's him.

255
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,476
So, he makes video games?

256
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,280
- Apps, Dad.
- This is it!

257
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,793
This is his house?
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,316
Are you sure this isn't
an Apple Store or something?

259
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
Oh, my God.

260
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,239
What is up, you gang?

261
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,634
I know!

262
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,756
The Flemings are here.
You have arrived!

263
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,717
Hi, buddy. Hi.

264
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,434
Hello, sweetheart.

265
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,549
Don't touch anything.
How was traffic?

266
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,696
It was okay.
Hi, they're here!

267
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Hello.

268
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,153
Hello to you, Ned Fleming.

269
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Barbara.
Yes.

270
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,110
You are perfect.

271
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,271
Well, thank you.
Oh, my God.

272
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
And this must be the main man.
Scotty, huh?

273
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,151
Yup.
All right. Hey.

274
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,033
- Who are you?
- Gustav.

275
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,553
I am Gustav. Yes.

276
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,078
I never know
how to describe you.

277
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,312
Um, well, estate manager
is cool, Stephy, yes.

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,515
That works.

279
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,875
I used to run
the Four Seasons group in Asia

280
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,473
but after some point,
you know,

281
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,336
the corporate life becomes
a bit of a snooze-fest.

282
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,157
You know, "Tiffany's this,
Cartier that."

283
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,715
But, you know. Just dot,
dot, dot. Enough already.

284
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,472
You know what I'm
talking about, Ned.

285
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
Oh, yeah. Sure.

286
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Boring.

287
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,673
Where's Laird?
Laird is upstairs.

288
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,592
He is just finishing
a teleconference.

289
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
He'll be right out.

290
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,279
Oh, okay.
Why don't we go up then?

291
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Laird, I'm Ned.

292
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
No, no, no.

293
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,576
No, this is Randy.
That's not Laird.

294
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
He's our intern.

295
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,036
Just graduated
summa cum laude at MIT.

296
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,997
So Randy, shake a leg.
Get their luggages.

297
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,309
Yes, sir.

298
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,075
The motherfucking Flemings
are in the house!

299
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Yes!

300
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,030
This is fucking awesome!

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,111
Get up here.
I'm so psyched to meet you.

302
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,280
Family, baby.
Fuck yeah!

303
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,999
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,513
Scotty.

305
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,752
Yes, my brotha!
Welcome.

306
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,148
Hey, Barb.
Hi.

307
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,869
Oh.

308
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Welcome.

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,071
Hey, Ned. All right.

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,593
Oh, yes.

311
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,038
Yes.
Yes.

312
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,474
Yes.
So glad you're here.

313
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,834
Yes.
Hey. Hi.

314
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,075
Hey, baby.
Hi.

315
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,909
I fucking missed you.

316
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,196
Why aren't you wearing a shirt
on your body?

317
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Oh.

318
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,520
Don't worry about that.
I have a little surprise.

319
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,273
Let's stay half an hour and
then we go back to the hotel.

320
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,032
That's a good plan.
Thank you.

321
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,553
Dad, come on.
This place is so sick.

322
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,477
Yeah, it's sick.
25 minutes.

323
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
That's it.

324
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,149
Hey! Just leave her alone.

325
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,713
Hey, oh, Ned. Ned.

326
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,314
Ned, would you look at that.

327
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,833
That's your face, Sis.
Oh.

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,194
Very good likeness.

329
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,389
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

330
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,199
The Stephy tattoo. I got it, like,
a week after we met, right?

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,918
One week. You know,
right on my heart.

332
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,315
Great. Okay, do you guys
want to go see the house?

333
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,520
Uh...
We probably should...

334
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,671
We came to stop and say hey.
Yeah. We should go.

335
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Actually, no.

336
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,600
No. Before we go, um...

337
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,392
I have a little surprise
for everybody.

338
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,710
Shit.
I'm fucking nervous.

339
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,096
Do you want to
consult me about it?

340
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,256
You want to talk to me
before you...

341
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,271
You know what? No, I'm just
jumpin' in. All right?

342
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm just going to do this.

343
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,312
Laird, it's going to be
fucking great.

344
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,078
Ta-da!

345
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,829
Oh, my God.

346
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,238
I just got it done
this morning

347
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,958
Yeah.
I bet it's red, huh?

348
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,189
I need a little feedback.

349
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,436
Is that our Christmas card?
Yes.

350
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,273
Yeah! That's exactly what
I used. How'd you know?

351
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,616
Look, he even got
Noodle in there.

352
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,789
Hurt like balls.

353
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,396
Gosh, it says "Happy Holidays"
and everything.

354
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,629
What?

355
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,677
Get the fuck out of here.
Okay.

356
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,114
It says "Happy Holidays?"

357
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Barb, fuck you.

358
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,634
God damn.

359
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,512
I gave the guy
the Christmas card.

360
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,136
I didn't know he put
"Happy Holidays" on there.

361
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,513
Wow.
Fuck.

362
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,472
Guess it's stuck on there,
huh?

363
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,908
Oops.
Fuck.

364
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,991
Well, you know,
you guys were coming over...

365
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,913
I was so excited, I just had
to do something, you know?

366
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,674
Well, that is something,
all right.

367
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,559
You know what? Sometimes, you
just got to say, "Fuck it."

368
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Fuck it!

369
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,829
You should...
Laird,

370
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,911
this is a 15-year-old child.

371
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,513
So, we don't really...

372
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,238
Oh, shit.

373
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,595
- You don't say fuck?
- No, Mom, I...

374
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Heck yeah, I cuss.

375
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,955
No, you don't.

376
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
You do?
Yeah.

377
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,673
Oh, he cusses.
No, you don't.

378
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,096
Yeah, bro, what's your
favorite cuss word?

379
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Oh, boy.

380
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,280
Don't egg him on like that.

381
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,395
What's your favorite?

382
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,071
- Uh...
- Hmm.

383
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,349
Titties.

384
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,839
Titties? Titties.

385
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,240
Stop it. Stop that.

386
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,713
Titties? Classic.

387
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,871
Okay. We should be going.

388
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,553
Nice one. What else you got?
Asshole.

389
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,216
Asshole.
All right. That's enough.

390
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,376
Okay. Another good body part.

391
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,833
What else?
Dicking. Double dicking.

392
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,479
Double dicking.
Okay.

393
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,834
Wait. Hold on.
Double dicking?

394
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,656
Are you happy?
That's a new one on me, bro.

395
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
What the fuck is that?

396
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,030
What the hell is that?
Is that like dick to dick?

397
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,476
Okay! Good night!
We're going to the hotel.

398
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,757
This kid is nasty
and I fucking like it.

399
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,239
Yeah.
Yes!

400
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,833
All right, let's do the tour.

401
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,216
I'll show you around!
All right?

402
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,468
Just throw your shit anywhere.

403
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,960
You little double-dicker,
come on.

404
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
Throw your stuff anywhere.

405
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,314
By the way,
I'm a huge fan.

406
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,719
I'm part of
the online Ape Army.

407
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Awesome.

408
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,440
You know, this is what I was trying
to tell you guys in the car.

409
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,118
This is okay here?

410
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,358
Do you want to
take your coat off?

411
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,112
Uh, no.
Nope. I'm fine.

412
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,599
Come on, guys.

413
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,736
All right,
so this here's the kitch.

414
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,273
This is where
we keep the food.

415
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,475
The dining room.

416
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,279
That's a sculpture
of a couple people fucking.

417
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,711
Painting of a fat squirrel.

418
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,552
And this one's called
"Triple Team,"

419
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,999
self-explanatory.

420
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,438
All right. This is the den.

421
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,433
These dudes are just
testing out video games.

422
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,392
Ned, Stephy says that you're
pretty serious about your bowling,

423
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,351
so I had
a couple lanes installed.

424
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,195
Oh, my God.

425
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,376
None of this was here?

426
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
No.

427
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,517
You said you were fixing
a crack in the foundation.

428
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,272
Is that us?

429
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,870
Yeah, I got the images off
your league's Facebook page.

430
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,189
That's so insane.

431
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,828
Dad, look, he even got in
your signature "crotch chop."

432
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,828
Oh, yeah.

433
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Wow.

434
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,336
All right, this here is
where we develop a few apps

435
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,237
for the Apple and
Android platforms.

436
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,158
Hey, gang,
say hi to the Flemings.

437
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,429
Hey, guys.
Hey, what's up?

438
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,398
Wait, I don't understand.
Do your employees live here?

439
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,358
Uh, maybe some of them do.
I don't really know.

440
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,550
Gustav is actually
an amazing architect.

441
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,278
We designed
this place together.

442
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,396
When did you
go to Machu Picchu?

443
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,471
Hun, when did
you put these up?

444
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,358
What the heck is that moose?

445
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,669
That's a Phillip Manfredi.

446
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,068
Great pick-up, Barb.

447
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,277
Stephy told me that you're this amazing
art and photography professor.

448
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,032
- That's awesome.
- Mmm-hmm.

449
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,431
I teach a couple of classes
at a local community college.

450
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,079
Don't be so modest, Mom.

451
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,116
You're an amazing
photographer.

452
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,271
Oh, that looks like
a real dead moose.

453
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,794
Well, that's exactly
what it is, Ned.

454
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,679
A dead moose
suspended in its own urine.

455
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,478
It's meant to
symbolize the way

456
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,835
that our culture
has imprisoned our minds.

457
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Oh.

458
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,595
I got to tell you, Ned,

459
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,989
great art really
gets me aroused.

460
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,720
It's actually
a very strong aphrodisiac.

461
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,835
Laird.

462
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,536
Not that you need any help getting
turned on by that gorgeous woman.

463
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,629
Honey.

464
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,438
What? Your mom
is beautiful.

465
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,471
She is. She deserves
some props for that.

466
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,632
Well, I'll take a compliment
wherever I can get one.

467
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,070
Well, here's another one.
You got a bangin' bod, too.

468
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,195
All right.

469
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,554
Hey, what's going on,
everyone?

470
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,318
Richard Blais, everybody.

471
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,995
This is the maestro
of molecular gastronomy.

472
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,673
Oh, my God.

473
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,990
That's that cute one
from Top Chef.

474
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,798
Oh, he's the one
who goes, "Bam!"

475
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,236
No, that's Emeril.
He's a fucking dick, that guy.

476
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,668
Dickie Blais what's up?

477
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,435
Yeah, so Laird thought it would be a
fun idea to do a pop-up restaurant

478
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,680
just in your honor tonight.

479
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,313
Did he?
Yeah.

480
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,198
And I have here
a little amuse-bouche.

481
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,296
So if anyone's looking for
a little pre-dinner snack,

482
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,389
you can head on up here.

483
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,232
Count me in,
'cause I'm famished.

484
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
All right.

485
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,520
There are so many surprises.

486
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
I know.

487
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,016
You're hungry, you've come
to the right place.

488
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,519
I've got surf
and turf for you.

489
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,795
Steak and lobster.

490
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,075
Yum, yum.

491
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,113
My version of surf and turf,
edible soil and plankton foam.

492
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,759
Dig in.
Oh.

493
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,189
Wow, can't wait for dinner.

494
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
No.

495
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,680
Hey, so I think
it's going great, right?

496
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,717
I think they've already
accepted me.

497
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,314
I'm getting a little bit
of a different vibe.

498
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,913
Oh, really?
Like what?

499
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,399
Don't try so hard.

500
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,834
I'm not,
what do you mean?

501
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,911
You put in a bowling alley
for my dad

502
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,953
and you got a tattoo of my
entire family on your back.

503
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,395
Oh.

504
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Was the tattoo too much?

505
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,715
Yes.
Fuck.

506
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,437
Shit, I knew it.

507
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,079
Yeah, Gustav said
the same thing.

508
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,309
Okay, don't worry...

509
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,392
I won't get any more tattoos
of them while they're here.

510
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,629
Thank you.
Okay.

511
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,875
I love you.

512
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,272
I love you, too.

513
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Okay.

514
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,456
Oh, one more thing, stop
calling them motherfuckers

515
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,118
and talking about
how hot my mom is.

516
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,999
Well, she's sneaky sexy,
took me by surprise.

517
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,073
Dude, she is a MILF,
like a genuine MILF.

518
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,397
And if it wasn't your MILF,
she'd be a MIWF...

519
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,073
a mother I would fuck.

520
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,275
Mmm-mmm.

521
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,998
But I won't.
Okay.

522
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,871
Of course.
Thank you.

523
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,638
All right, it's pretty.
Yeah.

524
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
You know...

525
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
It's a lot.

526
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,479
Yes! I mean, the moose...
Yes.

527
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,318
And the language.
Come on!

528
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,038
Mmm-hmm.
A real moose!

529
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,230
And he's coming onto your mother.
That's not okay.

530
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,594
And the tattoo?

531
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,957
The tattoo! And how...

532
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,758
32
Oh, my. And you're...

533
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,069
22.
Yes!

534
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,310
You didn't like the mural
of you and Scotty

535
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,600
down in the new bowling alley?

536
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,756
The bowling alley
with the mural is...

537
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,438
And the bowling alley
is regulation.

538
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,113
That's quite nice

539
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,192
and that's very rare
to have something that nice.

540
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,696
And the polish
that he used was quite...

541
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
It was good. But...

542
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,949
I'm sorry.

543
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I should have told you.

544
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,952
About everything, of course.

545
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,557
Honestly, I didn't know how to
explain him over the phone.

546
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,432
I just kept imagining...

547
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,153
Mom Googling Laird Mayhew

548
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,629
and you guys
jumping to conclusions

549
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,029
before you even got
a chance to know him.

550
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,592
Well, now we know him.

551
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,714
No, you don't.

552
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,438
You've been here
for 15 minutes.

553
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah.

554
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,558
Thank you.

555
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,896
I wouldn't have asked you
to come out here

556
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,120
and miss Christmas in Michigan

557
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,556
for the first time ever,
if he wasn't...

558
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,039
...really important to me.

559
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,669
Hmm.

560
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Okay.

561
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,150
You'll give him a chance?

562
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,675
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

563
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,872
Come here.

564
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
I love you.

565
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,039
I love you, too.

566
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,398
So if I did Google him,
what would I find?

567
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Don't do it.

568
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Oh.

569
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,715
Just don't Google him.

570
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Oh.

571
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,317
Well, I still don't see it.

572
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,351
Darling, this is the male,
and he's thrusting.

573
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Oh, God.

574
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,313
All right, everybody,
dinner is served!

575
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,516
Scotty! Come on,
grab a stump.

576
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,875
Dad, you wanna
go there? Mom.

577
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,656
You sure you don't want
to take off your coat?

578
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
No. I'm good.

579
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,990
We do it family style here,
so everyone just dig in.

580
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,479
It's super cas.

581
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,875
Okay, so we have three dishes
for this evening.

582
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,996
We have sous-vide geoduck.

583
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,957
We have Mission-style
sea urchin burritos...

584
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Yum.

585
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,394
...with edible paper.

586
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,398
Because you're a printer.

587
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,039
And last but not least...
Sweet.

588
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,839
...we have smoked
California bear.

589
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Enjoy.

590
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,393
Oh, shit!

591
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,709
Thanks, Blais.

592
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,199
- Bear?
- Mmm.

593
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
Yo, Scotty,
you see The Revenant?

594
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,994
No, I wanted to,

595
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,216
but my parents don't really
let me watch R-rated movies.

596
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,880
You're darn right we don't.
He's only 15.

597
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,235
You want some paper?
Yes, certainly. Thank you.

598
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,879
I don't know
what section that is.

599
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,156
Because that bear
fucked that dude up!

600
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,593
Now we're gonna
fuck this bear up.

601
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,233
Hey, what about
that language?

602
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Oh, shit. Sorry.

603
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,036
Ah, I think I've got
the arts section here.

604
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,272
You better slow down, Barb.

605
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
You're gonna be full
before you get to the funnies.

606
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,475
Ned.

607
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,076
So, um, how did
you two meet?

608
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,749
Uh, you want me to go?
Yeah.

609
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Okay.

610
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,195
Laird sponsored
a talk on campus

611
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,599
with Doctor Joanne Liu,

612
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,160
the head of
Doctors Without Borders.

613
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Oh!

614
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,356
Melinda Gates
got me totally pumped

615
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,880
about issues
in the developing world.

616
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Now I'm obsessed.

617
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,315
Wow.

618
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,792
- That's Bill Gates' wife.
- Yeah.

619
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,279
- She's great.
- Yeah.

620
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,759
That's terrific.

621
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,480
That's Steph's field of interest, too,
so that's great.

622
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,749
Yeah, I know.

623
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,400
Ned, you should've
seen her at the talk.

624
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,756
She asked the most intelligent
question. I was blown away.

625
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,959
Really? What did I say?

626
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,235
You were like...

627
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,616
"Hey, what's
the connection between

628
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,915
"women's health
and population density

629
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,599
"in indigenous communities?"

630
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,990
I was like,
"Bam! Who's that?"

631
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,792
That's so sweet of you
to remember that.

632
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,791
Of course I remember. Mmm...

633
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,840
- The first time I saw you.
- That's our girl.

634
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,776
She's always been the smartest
person in the room.

635
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
So true.
Yeah.

636
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,990
And the sexiest. My God.
Well.

637
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,196
I couldn't keep
my eyes off her.

638
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,679
Her hair, and her eyes.

639
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,795
Very pretty eyes.

640
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,518
The way her spine
gently arches

641
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,158
to meet the top
of her tailbone.

642
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,816
I just wanna pitch a tent and live in there.
You know what I mean?

643
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
No.
You're taking it too far.

644
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,118
Quite the outdoorsman.

645
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,872
I just mean
she's got a great body.

646
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,553
Oh, well, yes.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

647
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,994
She's a darling girl.

648
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,296
- Like you, Barb.
- Great genes.

649
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Okay.

650
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,554
Two fit women.

651
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,358
I'll have to
agree with you there.

652
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,317
Ol' Slamming Bod Barb.

653
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,710
Two fit women
and two lucky dudes...

654
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,509
And one double-dicker.

655
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,831
Okay, well.

656
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,198
Laird, when did you graduate
from Stanford?

657
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,192
Oh, I didn't go
to Stanford, bro.

658
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
I hardly even graduated
from high school.

659
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,868
He's being modest.

660
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,176
He actually
started writing code

661
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,555
for Sun Microsystems
when he was 13.

662
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,318
That's true.
Wow, that's just like me.

663
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,120
I've been interning
at the Fleming Company

664
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,519
since, what,
the seventh grade?

665
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,869
Mm-hmm. Yup.

666
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,996
Future CEO,
but you are going to college.

667
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,656
I know, Dad. I know. I know.
Just like your sister.

668
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,671
So, Steph,
weren't your surprised

669
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,673
that this big tech mogul
wanted to date you?

670
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,154
He said he was some
low-level programmer at Uber.

671
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,669
I had no idea that
he sponsored the entire event.

672
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,875
So he lied to you.

673
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,359
Oh, Ned, I had to.

674
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,875
I mean there are so many gold
diggers in Silicon Valley.

675
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,389
They just wanna fuck you
for your tech money.

676
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,232
Language, baby.
You gotta be careful.

677
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,391
I didn't spill the beans
till April.

678
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,518
April? That's
eight months ago. What?

679
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,033
Steph, over the phone,
you said

680
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,856
you've only known each other
for a couple of months.

681
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,916
It was super casual at first.
No.

682
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,115
No, it was not.

683
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,430
We exchanged I love you's
on the third date.

684
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,016
Remember? Right after we...
The third date?

685
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,216
made love in the hot tub
at Esalen in Big Sur?

686
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
No, no, no.

687
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,236
Where, what?
Esalen in Big Sur.

688
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,435
Really?

689
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,596
Ned. Don't get
the wrong idea.

690
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,593
It was not sexual at all.
It was so much more than that.

691
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,920
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

692
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,399
Did you have
intercourse or not?

693
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,788
Scotty, shut it.

694
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,376
Dad, I'm just trying to
connect the dots here.

695
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,799
Look. Yeah, we did.

696
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,555
But what I'm saying is
I was transformed.

697
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,757
Stephy opened up
like a flower.

698
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,319
You should have seen it.

699
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,438
I shouldn't have seen it,
but now I feel like I have.

700
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,999
I just want
your parents to know

701
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,360
that you're
living with someone

702
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,152
who's completely
devoted to you.

703
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,592
Wait a minute.
What-ing with someone?

704
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,796
You say you're living together?
Yeah.

705
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,434
No. We do not.

706
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,631
Okay, five nights
out of seven.

707
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,512
Your stuff is here.

708
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,000
You don't really
stay at the dorm.

709
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,600
Do you have
a toothbrush here?

710
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Yeah.
That's cohabitating.

711
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,797
Scotty, stop talking
and eat your paper.

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,678
Dad,
we do not live together.

713
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,319
Yeah, we're cohabitating.

714
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,636
"Opened up like a flower."

715
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,633
Honey, I'm looking at
the Esalen website right now

716
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,313
and there's nothing
dirty about it.

717
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,153
You go up there for yoga
classes and things like that.

718
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,993
They've been practically
living together for a year.

719
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,639
Why didn't she
just tell us that?

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,197
Where the heck are the towels?

721
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,871
He's even affected Scotty.

722
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,997
What is a double dicking,
for crying out loud?

723
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,555
Oh.
Uh...

724
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
There she is.

725
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,273
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah. She's gonna...

726
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,440
She better explain what
the heck is going on here.

727
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
All right,
so be nice.

728
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,976
Be like, "Oh, my God.
I love your boyfriend. He's so normal."

729
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,194
I'm good.

730
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,315
Hi.

731
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,395
Hi, uh...

732
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,312
I thought you'd be Stephanie.

733
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,515
Steph's super pooped.

734
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,672
We had a big fight because of
the way I behaved at dinner.

735
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,080
Don't worry, we took a shower
together and worked it out.

736
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,029
But I snuck out
to have a little check in.

737
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Okay. Well...

738
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,995
Ned, would you
come join us?

739
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,359
I'm good here.

740
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,869
Oh, please.
This is an Alaskan king.

741
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,553
There's so much room.

742
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,513
So much room.

743
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,231
It'd really mean
a lot to me. Please?

744
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,029
Okay.

745
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Hey.

746
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,069
I owe you two
an apology.

747
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
When I get nervous

748
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,039
all kinds of crap comes
flying out of my mouth

749
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,031
and I know that's not
how you guys roll.

750
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
No.

751
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,071
I was just trying
to make a good impression.

752
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,912
Yeah. Well, you did.
It was...

753
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,116
I mean you didn't,
but it's okay.

754
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,352
It was an awkward dinner.

755
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,278
It was a unique
situation for...

756
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,072
Yeah, but let's all
just move on.

757
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,478
Okay. Great.

758
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Truth be told,

759
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,031
I haven't spent a lot of time
with parental figures.

760
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,312
I don't know if you know this,
but I never knew my father.

761
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,559
Yeah, he picked up my mom
in this bar in Oakland.

762
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,837
They had some sloppy car sex,
and then never spoke again.

763
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,955
Yeah.

764
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,230
I'm not really close
with my mom, either.

765
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,590
To be frank, she's kind of
a motherfucking bitch.

766
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,596
If I had a nickel
for every time I...

767
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,389
Yeah.

768
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,755
We're sorry to hear that.

769
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,638
That's some tough stuff, pal.

770
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,074
Yup. That's...

771
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
That's...

772
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,995
All right. Well,
it's getting late, so...

773
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Yeah.

774
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,957
I'm in love
with your daughter, dudes.

775
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,394
And I'm just so
fucking psyched

776
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,311
to get to know
the people that raised her.

777
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,515
Mmm-hmm.

778
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,353
And we're gonna do Christmas
just like you do at home.

779
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,555
Tomorrow night,

780
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,949
I'm gonna throw a party
in your honor.

781
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,016
Oh, you don't have to
go to the trouble.

782
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,109
You don't... It's not.

783
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,760
We're gonna do
all the holiday shit.

784
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,436
Okay. Hmm.
All the shit.

785
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,990
Ned, I'd love some
guy time with you.

786
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,310
So maybe we could take a walk
tomorrow morning?

787
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,799
Okay.
Okay, cool.

788
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,110
Justine, will you set Ned
an alarm for 6:30 a.m.?

789
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,280
You got it, Laird.

790
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,199
Ned, an alarm's been set for
you for 6:30 en la mañana.

791
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,918
What? Who is that?

792
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,033
That's Justine.

793
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,192
Yeah, she's like Siri,
but awesome.

794
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,197
I got that chick from
The Big Bang Theory,

795
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,679
Kaley Cuoco,
to do the voice.

796
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
J, say hi.

797
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,190
Hey, Ned. Hey, Barb.
How are you guys?

798
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,075
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

799
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,792
Stephanie's told me
so much about you.

800
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,359
Anything you need, I'm here.

801
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,669
- Okay.
- Thank you.

802
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,990
She can't...
Can she see us?

803
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,315
She says that she can't,
but I think that she can.

804
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,240
What the fuck
are you talking about?

805
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,509
You know I can't see them.

806
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,069
She's a perv.

807
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Laird.

808
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,352
Anyway, I hope you two have
a nice night's rest.

809
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,039
Yeah, have a good night.
Great night.

810
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,235
Have a great night.
Yeah.

811
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,396
My instinct is to
hug you right now.

812
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,278
- Oh. No.
- I don't think you...

813
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,629
That's okay.
Oh.

814
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,711
Oh, my God.
Barb.

815
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,074
Good night.

816
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Peace.

817
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,230
Baby, I want to trim your...

818
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,555
Baby, I want to trim your...

819
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,589
Baby, I want to trim your...

820
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,391
Beautiful Christmas tree

821
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,913
I'm gonna bring along
my hatchet

822
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,909
My beautiful Christmas balls

823
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,438
I'll sprinkle my snow
upon your tree

824
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,751
And hang a mistletoe
on your walls

825
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,311
Baby, I want to trim your...

826
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,958
Oh, beautiful Christmas tree

827
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,556
Barb? There's
no toilet paper.

828
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Uh-oh.

829
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,398
Would you get
a roll for me, please?

830
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,953
Papa make a poopie?

831
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,951
Yes. I made a poopie.

832
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,394
Did Daddy do a doo-doo?

833
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,636
Barb, just get
the toilet paper, please?

834
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,392
All right.
Well, you sit tight.

835
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,833
I'm gonna go find you some TP.

836
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Thank you.

837
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Of course.

838
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,792
Mr. Playboy.

839
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,632
Unbelievable.

840
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,349
Who is that?

841
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,471
She's a bit of a Plain Jane.

842
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,834
Darling?
Yeah. Yup.

843
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,759
Just, um, crack the door
and toss the roll, please.

844
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,997
It's gonna be a little
more complicated than that.

845
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,639
Good morning, Ned.

846
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,469
It's Gustav.

847
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Great.

848
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,996
As I've already told Barb,
we are a paperless household.

849
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,159
Paperless? What?

850
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,195
It's a paperless
house, darling.

851
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,509
I got that.

852
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,719
But how am I supposed to
complete my business?

853
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,518
Well, all Japanese toilets

854
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,114
have a very effective
and pleasant cleaning spray.

855
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,469
And I will be very happy

856
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,790
to walk you through the entire process.
Oh, God.

857
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,838
Ned, please locate the
control panel to your left.

858
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,472
Okay, I see it.

859
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
Now on that
control panel is a button

860
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,794
that shows an image
of water spraying up.

861
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,797
Okay. And I just push it?

862
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,149
Just press it, yes.

863
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,079
Was that cologne?

864
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,559
Oh!
Cologne? Oh, yes!

865
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,194
That is a designer-scented
talcum powder.

866
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,195
But that button should
not have activated that.

867
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,193
Ned, that is what is called Big
Pony for Men by the Ralph Lauren.

868
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,429
I'm excited to try.

869
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,872
Can we please just continue?
All right.

870
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,393
Ned?
Yes.

871
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,551
I would like to apologize
sincerely again.

872
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,190
This is the 2018 model
that you are on right now,

873
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,475
so they have not yet made

874
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,551
an instruction manual
in English yet.

875
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,871
So I'm going to take care
of this on my end, all right?

876
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,753
So Ned, you focus on
your end in there

877
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,554
and I will focus
on your end out here.

878
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,553
That's too good.
This is it.

879
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,392
This should do it, Ned.

880
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,040
Okay. Something's whirring.

881
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,036
Something's spinning around
in there.

882
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,911
No! Turn it off!

883
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,116
Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

884
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
God!

885
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,759
Oh, scheisse!

886
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,070
We are having some
technical difficulties.

887
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,798
That was the vaginal cleanse.

888
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
The what cleanse?

889
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,752
I just want a square
of toilet paper.

890
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,069
The vaginal cleanse.

891
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,514
Which I hear is refreshing

892
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,636
and apparently
also very stimulating.

893
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,429
Just saying.

894
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Ned?

895
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Really?

896
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
I'm so sorry, Ned...

897
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,831
but I'm going to have to manually
reboot the system from the inside.

898
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,275
In here?

899
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,759
I am so sorry.

900
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,955
Fine.

901
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,955
Why not?

902
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,795
Barb, would you
close the door? Sorry.

903
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,393
It's gonna be great.

904
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,792
Ned, I am blinders.

905
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,515
I see nothing.
I smell nothing.

906
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,471
The print is very small.
Mm-hmm.

907
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,834
Okay, forgive me.

908
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,591
I can't see the instructions.

909
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,032
All right.
What do we have here?

910
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Hmm...

911
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,038
I had some
stomach problems last night.

912
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,033
I think it was the bear.

913
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,470
I can guarantee you,
it was the bear.

914
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,837
Turning on the fan.

915
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,710
Great. Wunderbar.

916
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,519
How'd it go?

917
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,389
I am so sorry
that it took so long.

918
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,915
Ned, I'm going to need you
to be completely still

919
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,355
while we try to
lock in your location.

920
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,835
I'm sitting on a toilet,
that's pretty still.

921
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,355
Searching,
searching, und searching.

922
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,869
And we have target achieved!

923
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,519
And sploosh!

924
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,715
Oh!

925
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,551
There you go, girls.

926
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,073
You raise chickens?

927
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,912
All free-range.

928
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,274
Cows, too.

929
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,795
Pigs, artisanal llamas.

930
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,313
Everything you eat here

931
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,550
comes from within
a 500-yard radius.

932
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,115
I call it
"lawn to table eating."

933
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
There she is.

934
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,954
Hey, Daisy.

935
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,833
Oh.
Hi.

936
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,072
Go on, get.

937
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,880
So glad we're
doing this, Ned.

938
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,056
I feel like I know you after everything
that Steph's told me about you,

939
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,638
but still not the same...

940
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,554
Do you submit?
Fuck you!

941
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,273
Gustav!
Ned, stay away!

942
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
You wanna fight?

943
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Tap out!
No!

944
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,075
You want to tap out.

945
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,832
Okay, okay! Fine!

946
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,479
Nice work!

947
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,136
And your reactions
are getting quicker.

948
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Really?
Absolutely.

949
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Thanks.

950
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
I am so sorry, Ned. I just
didn't want you to get hurt.

951
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,953
Wait, so you just do
this Pink Panther thing?

952
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,519
Pink Panther?
Pink Panther?

953
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,955
The Pink Panther
from the Pink Panther movies.

954
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,317
When Cato attacks Inspector
Clouseau to keep him sharp.

955
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,096
Are those really old?
I never heard of it.

956
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,155
I'm not familiar, either,

957
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,833
but it sounds
absolutely charming.

958
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,959
Pink Panther.

959
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,513
The movies?
Mm-hmm.

960
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,670
Cato is his assistant,
his houseboy.

961
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,193
Houseboy?
Well, it's...

962
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,316
That sounds racist.

963
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,628
He did call him "my little
yellow friend." But...

964
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,096
I'm sorry, you have to
understand, Ned.

965
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,680
Laird is the CEO
of a massive tech company.

966
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,472
I don't like
bodyguards around

967
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,473
so I have Goose train me in case
I get kidnapped or whatever.

968
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,319
By the way, your Chun Kuk Do
moves were very solid.

969
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,152
But what happened to
the evasive parkour?

970
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,514
Ah, evasive parkour.
Yeah.

971
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,033
I totally fucking spaced!

972
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,838
There's always
room to improve.

973
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,035
All right.
Thanks, man.

974
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,519
You got it, brother.

975
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,352
All right, ciao for now,
you friends.

976
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,954
And you guys have
a lovely chat.

977
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,640
Ned, come on. I wanna
show you my office.

978
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,398
You know, that's like
classic Pink Panther.

979
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,400
- This is where you work, huh?
- Yeah.

980
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,552
I have a den in the house
where I do the financial stuff

981
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,915
but this is where
all the big ideas happen.

982
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,991
Don't you need
a computer and...

983
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,196
Nah. My girl Justine
records everything.

984
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,475
Right, J?

985
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,398
Yep, I'm here.
Hey, Ned.

986
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,640
Hey, why don't you play back
a blip from yesterday's session?

987
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,336
All right, hold on. Fuck. There's
so much shit up here in your Cloud.

988
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,554
Okay, okay got it.

989
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,393
Come on, idiot, think.
Names for games. Um...

990
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,353
Ape Assassins Six:
Capuchin Chaos.

991
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,875
Uh, Silverback Salsa.

992
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,235
Baboon Bukkake.

993
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,628
Fuck! Wow, that's awful!

994
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,755
Bad idea.

995
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,915
Why? Why's that?

996
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Uh...

997
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,559
What does that mean?

998
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Bukkake?

999
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,029
Oh, um...

1000
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,958
Just means a lot of
things are happening

1001
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,256
and you're feeling
overwhelmed.

1002
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,554
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

1003
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,597
Yeah.
I've felt bukkake before.

1004
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Hmm...

1005
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,074
Grab a seat. Make yourself
comf. Let's break it down.

1006
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,230
Just pop down
right here on the floor.

1007
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,868
There you go.

1008
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,072
Ned, I think you and
I have so much in common.

1009
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,550
We see something we want
and we just dive in

1010
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
and we take it.

1011
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Know what I mean?

1012
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,035
Yeah.

1013
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,788
Which is why...

1014
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,074
...on Christmas Day...

1015
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,717
I'm going to ask Stephy
to marry me.

1016
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,960
And I know
how tight you two are.

1017
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Mm-hmm.

1018
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,759
So I'd really, really

1019
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,955
like your blessing.

1020
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,318
Uh, Laird.

1021
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,616
Really appreciate
you coming to me.

1022
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
'Course.

1023
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,990
But, uh, the answer's no.

1024
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,151
Dude, I'm so confused.

1025
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,356
What the fuck?
What the hell?

1026
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,794
This went so much differently

1027
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,353
when I rehearsed it
with Gustav.

1028
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,636
Yeah. I asked you
and you were like,

1029
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,113
"Yeah, dude. My son."

1030
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,151
Laird. Listen to me, okay.

1031
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,469
Beside the fact that I don't know
you from a hole in the wall...

1032
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,474
Stephanie is just not ready
for this step in her life.

1033
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,632
Oh, I'm totally getting
the signals that she is.

1034
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,439
I'm her father,
I know her pretty well.

1035
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,437
Okay, all right.
All right, Ned...

1036
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,278
Dude, I know
I sprung this on you.

1037
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,994
My bad. Okay?
Let's just back it up.

1038
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,195
All right?
All right.

1039
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,517
Why don't you give me a few
days to win you over, okay?

1040
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,874
And by Christmas morning...

1041
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,508
I promise, you're going to be
calling me "son."

1042
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,477
I'm gonna be
calling you "Dad".

1043
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,816
Don't think
that's going to happen.

1044
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,831
I think it's gonna, Dad.

1045
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Don't.

1046
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,789
Dad, come on.

1047
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,536
Don't call me "Dad."
Don't call you "Dad"?

1048
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
I'm not your dad.

1049
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,836
I mean,
you're gonna be my dad.

1050
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
No. No.

1051
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,758
What, Dad?

1052
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,480
Okay, now you're
playing with me.

1053
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,391
All right. Dad.

1054
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,758
Look, Laird.

1055
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,508
Why do you even care
about what I think?

1056
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,033
You're Stephanie's father.

1057
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,039
I'm not gonna ask Stephanie to marry
me unless I have your blessing.

1058
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,194
Okay.

1059
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,674
Justine, did you get that?

1060
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,558
Totes.
Yeah, recorded every word.

1061
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,711
Totes. And totes is what?

1062
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,758
It means totally. But totally's kind of long,
so "totes" is just easier.

1063
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Okay. Good.

1064
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Okay.
Okay.

1065
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,074
All right, cool.
Yeah.

1066
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,549
But you gotta
promise me

1067
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,871
that you won't tell Steph
anything about this.

1068
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,594
About any of this.

1069
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,394
Trust me, that is the last
thing in the world I will do.

1070
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,120
For reals, dude.
I want it to be a surprise.

1071
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,633
No word. I won't say a word.

1072
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,916
Barb and Scotty, too.
No clowning.

1073
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,475
No clowning.

1074
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,709
What?

1075
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,110
I'd just feel a lot better
about this if we pinky swore.

1076
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,795
Oh.

1077
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,277
I see what you mean.
Cool.

1078
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,712
Go get breakfast.
Okay.

1079
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,309
Fuck!

1080
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,429
Sup, guys?

1081
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,397
- Hey, boss.
- Mayhew!

1082
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,616
...took a little longer

1083
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,438
Go into the school
gonna run another banger

1084
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,991
The fuck?
Come with me immediately.

1085
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,398
The hell is this room?

1086
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,669
Randy, get the fuck out.

1087
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,955
Yes, sir, Gustav.
Mm-hmm.

1088
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,150
I am on the needles und pins.

1089
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,038
I need you to tell me
how it went right now

1090
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,155
or I'm going to burst.

1091
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,157
He said no!
What? Okay, okay.

1092
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,113
But how did you respond?

1093
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,959
I was blindsided, man.
I didn't know what to do.

1094
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
I challenged him.

1095
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,197
Okay.
I started calling him Dad.

1096
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,510
Oy vey.
The fuck, man!

1097
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,753
Why would you call him Dad?
You're putting him at unease!

1098
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,799
You have to find a way in.

1099
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,309
You have to do something
for him that's truly special

1100
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,835
so that he knows
that your intentions are pure.

1101
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
Dude, Goose, I don't know
how to talk to the guy.

1102
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,200
It's like we speak two different
languages or something.

1103
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
You do.
Yeah.

1104
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,674
He speaks English.

1105
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,469
And you speak English with
resounding amounts of "fuck."

1106
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,016
All right, Stephanie's been
on my case, too.

1107
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Yes.
I got it.

1108
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
All right?
Okay.

1109
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Right.
All right, man.

1110
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
Great.
Great.

1111
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,936
You just fucking really
hit me really hard.

1112
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,393
I know. I am sorry.

1113
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,518
It's just, Laird...

1114
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,035
...your relationship
with Miss Stephanie

1115
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,708
is very special.
It's the real deal.

1116
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Hey.
Yes.

1117
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,838
Goose, I know I pay you
a shit-ton of money,

1118
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,359
but you're my best friend.

1119
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,636
Our friendship is priceless.

1120
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,030
Hey. Thanks, brother.

1121
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,514
Okay.

1122
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,075
Okay. Ow! Mercy. Mercy.

1123
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Fuck.

1124
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
Bro, you're incredible.

1125
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,875
That was very imaginative

1126
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,439
how you took that
tender moment

1127
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,960
and used it
as your pivot to attack.

1128
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,314
Yeah.
Very good.

1129
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
What's up, Cheese?

1130
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,076
I'm about to go to
the football game.

1131
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,434
Lions, baby!

1132
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,874
Great. How's business?

1133
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,229
Tell me something good.

1134
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,594
Oh, uh...

1135
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,110
I talked to my guy
over at Dick's Sporting Goods.

1136
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,856
Don't tell me
they're going with China, too.

1137
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,915
Worse.

1138
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,957
Freaking online banner ads.

1139
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,917
No. Damn it.
All right, listen.

1140
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,269
I'm gonna call Don Millis at
Subaru of Southern Michigan.

1141
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,398
I heard a little rumor that they might
be looking for a new dance partner.

1142
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,113
Yeah, Don,
the big guy, right?

1143
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,032
You guys go back
to your car selling days.

1144
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,872
Yeah. It's worth a shot.
Listen...

1145
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,632
I need you to go in
and pull his card

1146
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,256
from my rolodex
while I look for a pen.

1147
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,077
You got it, Cheese.
No, you got it.

1148
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,312
So how goes it in Cali?

1149
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,436
It feels like we've landed
in The Twilight Zone.

1150
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Did you find the card?

1151
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,309
Yeah. I got it right here.

1152
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,833
Just hang on.

1153
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,393
I have nothing
to write with here.

1154
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,993
This whole house is paperless.

1155
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,120
Paperless?

1156
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,599
Well, how do you
wipe your ass?

1157
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720
You don't.

1158
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,916
They have these Japanese
toilets that...

1159
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,880
It's one of those little
squat jobs, little squatter.

1160
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,639
No. Just... never mind.
Just give me the number.

1161
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,119
Hey, Ned, I'm here.

1162
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,599
I can take it down for you.

1163
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,990
Justine, please just...
I'm fine.

1164
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Just go away.

1165
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,616
All right,
I'm just trying to help.

1166
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,920
You don't have to be
such a dick.

1167
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,310
Whoa, whoa.
Cheese, who is that?

1168
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,656
She's got a foul little mouth.

1169
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,296
Is that the kid's secretary
you fighting with?

1170
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,754
No, no, no. That's the woman
who lives in the ceiling.

1171
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Cheese, what she look like?

1172
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
The woman who lives...

1173
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,176
You say she lives
in the ceiling?

1174
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,919
She's a disembodied
voice that...

1175
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,678
Never mind.
I'll explain later.

1176
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,875
The voice sounds sexy.

1177
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,200
Are they using
somebody famous?

1178
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,231
I wouldn't say too famous.

1179
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,496
You know,
million dollars a week,

1180
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,296
biggest show in the world,
no big deal.

1181
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Lou.
She can hear me?

1182
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,120
Of course I can hear you.

1183
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,309
How you doin', baby?

1184
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,436
Better now
that I'm talking with you.

1185
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,600
Just give me the number.
I'm calling him now.

1186
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,353
Let's catch some waves.

1187
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,856
- Tsunami.
- That guy's cool.

1188
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,880
Yeah, Goose is the best.

1189
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,515
Oh...

1190
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,456
Laird, I'm gonna be
honest with you, buddy.

1191
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,480
Okay.

1192
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,511
Gorillas in board shorts
is a fun touch.

1193
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Yeah.
I'll give you that.

1194
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,536
But when the only mission
is to get to shore,

1195
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,920
I'm not feeling
enough drama there.

1196
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
You know?

1197
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,355
You know what?
You're so fucking right.

1198
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,555
Fuck!

1199
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,376
We've been developing this
limp dick for months.

1200
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,016
You come and
you play it for five minutes,

1201
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,712
you know exactly
what's wrong with it.

1202
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,030
You're a sharp little fucker.
You know that?

1203
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,879
Thank you.

1204
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,031
I mean, for real, man.
I appreciate it.

1205
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,399
It's just nice
to be listened to.

1206
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,349
What do you mean?

1207
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,336
I'm gonna be running
my dad's business one day.

1208
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Uh-huh.

1209
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,352
But he won't even listen to any
of my ideas about innovation.

1210
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,033
What?
Right?

1211
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,394
You're next gen, dude.

1212
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,920
It's where all the new seeds come from.
Everyone knows that.

1213
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,176
And I told him that.
I was like...

1214
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,668
"Dad, if you're gonna unleash
me to my full potentsh...

1215
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,960
"I need a seat
at the table."

1216
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,195
He just won't
listen to me.

1217
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,588
Um... Get that seat!

1218
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
I will get that seat.

1219
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,640
Gotta get that seat, Scotty.
That's my seat.

1220
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,908
Nobody else touch it.
No.

1221
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,719
Where is that seat?
It's at the fucking table.

1222
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,956
And I'm gonna
get that seat at that table.

1223
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,872
You deserve
a fucking throne, dawg.

1224
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,400
Yeah, the Iron Throne.
Iron Throne.

1225
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,056
Iron Throne.
Game of Thrones over here!

1226
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,216
I'm breathing fire and grabbing
titties left and right.

1227
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,416
Fucking King Joffrey
up in this.

1228
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Those are my titties!

1229
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,551
You're the next in line.
That's me.

1230
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
My man.

1231
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,754
Oh, God.

1232
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,594
They're paying
your student loans.

1233
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,195
Oh.

1234
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,119
Stamp Free Invites.

1235
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,753
Oh, man.

1236
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,116
Ho, ho, ho!

1237
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,795
Wow.

1238
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,240
Is that a horse?
That is a llama.

1239
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Oh, a llama.
Hi.

1240
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,635
Hello.

1241
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,631
Oh, my goodness.
Hey, girl.

1242
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,119
We don't have those in...

1243
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,639
Dad!

1244
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,950
There you are.
This is insane!

1245
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,473
Oh, you working on the books?

1246
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,471
Uh, yeah, you know.
Just the little stuff.

1247
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,475
I was thinking about
Laird's Christmas party.

1248
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,471
Gustav gave me a preview
of the guest list.

1249
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,551
And, Dad, it is a veritable
"who's who"

1250
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,039
of Silicon Valley
power players.

1251
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,838
Tyson Modell is coming!

1252
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,831
Wait, who is he?
What?

1253
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,016
He's the kid
who founded Ghostchat.

1254
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,109
Oh, right.

1255
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,696
He turned down three billion
dollars from Facebook,

1256
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,153
and he's only
24 years old.

1257
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,470
I'm gonna broker a sit-down
between you two.

1258
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,716
Dad, thank you for telling me
to pack a blazer.

1259
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,096
Now, should I throw on a tie or
should I keep it business casual?

1260
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,678
Scotty, just listen to me,
all right?

1261
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,910
Most of these
Internet companies

1262
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,036
are built on
smoke and mirrors.

1263
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,235
What?

1264
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Don't get sucked in.

1265
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,670
That whole industry
is based on hooey.

1266
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,956
I'm gonna drop
some knowledge on you.

1267
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,354
Times are changing, Pops.

1268
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,556
And not everything you think
is hooey is hooey.

1269
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,671
Wow. That's profound.

1270
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,394
Profound.

1271
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,794
And you...

1272
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,157
Hooey-meister himself.

1273
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,911
You're nothing but an octopus.

1274
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,119
An octopus.

1275
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,152
Merry fuckin' Christmas

1276
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,399
What are you pouring?

1277
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,391
We are doing a deconstructed
eggnog tonight.

1278
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,596
Eggnog. Yes. Thank you.

1279
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,034
Where you from, boss?

1280
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Michigan.

1281
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,753
Oh, Michigan.
You in the car business?

1282
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,036
Uh, no. Printing.
Ned Fleming.

1283
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,758
Elon Musk.
Elon Musk?

1284
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,509
Yeah.
Tesla, Elon Musk?

1285
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,914
Yeah.
Wow.

1286
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
How do you know Laird?

1287
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,714
Uh...

1288
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,597
He's dating my daughter.

1289
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,074
Uh-oh.

1290
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,434
Nice talking to you.
Yeah.

1291
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,635
What?

1292
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,116
Oh, hey! Hi, honey!

1293
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,470
Could I get a glass
of white wine, please?

1294
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,753
Ooh, hiya, handsome.
Hi!

1295
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,592
You look great.
Oh, come on.

1296
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,432
No, you do.
Thank you.

1297
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,319
I'm just getting in
the holiday spirit.

1298
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,155
So what were you talking to
Laird about for so long?

1299
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,791
I got the entire
Mayhew family saga.

1300
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,279
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1301
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,432
No, no, turns out it was
pretty interesting actually.

1302
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,751
His mother was a secretary at
one of these tech companies.

1303
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,275
Can I interest you
in a Kobe beef slider?

1304
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,759
Ooh, yum.
Real food?

1305
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,797
Yes, I'm starving.

1306
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,518
Wait, what?

1307
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,239
Oh, God.

1308
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,078
Ma'am? Kobe squirt?
No, thanks.

1309
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Thank you.

1310
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,433
It's actually pretty tasty.

1311
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,592
Anyway, she saw all these
young programmers getting rich.

1312
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,320
So she basically
forced Laird

1313
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,439
to spend his entire childhood
inside, learning computers.

1314
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,273
I think that's
kind of sad, right?

1315
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,313
He ate it.
Hmm.

1316
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,159
He's an octopus.

1317
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,151
That kid is
wrapping his tentacles

1318
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,998
around every member
of this family.

1319
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,513
He's manipulating you.

1320
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,989
Darling, we need to bring this
down a notch.

1321
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,310
Okay? You think you're
at war with Laird.

1322
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,153
But he's not fighting.
It's just you.

1323
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,976
Come on,
let's go meet his friends.

1324
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,035
They look darling.

1325
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,832
Oh, God.

1326
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,958
Totally tanked porting the
thin-client apps for the JDK build.

1327
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,536
The fuck? So you had to
rewrite all the code?

1328
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,551
Mm-hmm. By myself.

1329
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,915
But did you do it?
Oh, you know I did!

1330
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,479
Hey, there they are!
Hi.

1331
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
Looking like a babe.

1332
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,869
Look who's looking sharp.

1333
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,314
Okay!
Hello!

1334
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,800
Tyson, these are Stephanie's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Fleming.

1335
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,871
Oh, no. Barb and Ned, please.

1336
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,758
So it was fucked up, man.

1337
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,512
It took me two weeks

1338
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,358
on the J2EE database...

1339
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,696
trying to get the interface
to react with the server...

1340
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,711
so I can get the containers
up and running again.

1341
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,192
I'm sorry.
Tyson, what's a J2EE?

1342
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,231
Java 2 Platform
Enterprise Edition.

1343
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,714
Do you not write code?
Sorry.

1344
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,359
This guy's the worst.
Yeah.

1345
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,640
I'm actually more of a personal
relations kind of guy.

1346
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,280
Like account management, client services.
That kind of stuff.

1347
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,078
Dude, this kid is
fucking awesome.

1348
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,676
Yes, Ned is grooming Scotty
to take over our family business.

1349
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
That's right.

1350
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,552
We own a printing business
in Michigan.

1351
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,936
Really?
I'm sure you're familiar

1352
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,280
with those two siblings
over there

1353
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,072
since you're
in the printing business.

1354
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,515
Yo, brother-sister act!
You gotta meet this guy.

1355
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
Hello!

1356
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,432
Hey! Blaine
and Missy Pederman.

1357
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,749
Hi, I'm Barb Fleming.

1358
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,239
This is my husband.
Ned.

1359
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,868
I'm Scott Fleming.
Nice to meet you.

1360
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,712
I'm sorry, we were told
we might know you,

1361
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,074
but I'm afraid we don't.

1362
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,754
Blaine and Missy started
Stamp Free Invites.

1363
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,431
Oh, okay.

1364
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,749
Right.

1365
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
What's up?

1366
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,456
Did the server forget
to send a reminder

1367
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,311
for your birthday party
or something?

1368
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,438
No, he is actually
in the printing business.

1369
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,759
Oh, shit.
Whoops.

1370
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,880
No, no.

1371
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,256
We didn't put you
out of business or anything?

1372
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,280
No.

1373
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,675
What? Ruin our business?
No, no.

1374
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,512
We're doing quite well.
Thank you.

1375
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,635
Oh, that's great!

1376
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,136
Good for you!
Honestly, good for you.

1377
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,832
We love little
mom-and-pop printers.

1378
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,076
So inspirational.
So important. Mm-hmm.

1379
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,593
My dad has more of a factory.

1380
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,136
Not to brag,
but we're a pretty big shop.

1381
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,936
People need paper. They need
something to write on.

1382
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,656
They love the feel of that
card stock in their hands.

1383
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,680
Yeah.

1384
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,631
I've never heard
anyone say that.

1385
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,320
Hmm. We have not
found that at all.

1386
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,629
Yeah. Nope.

1387
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,416
I think we come from
two different worlds.

1388
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,475
Yes, we do.

1389
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,632
You better start learning code
pretty fucking fast, dude.

1390
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,074
Dude, Ned was crushing it

1391
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,794
since before you two were fighting
over your mother's titties.

1392
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,720
Our mom
didn't breastfeed us.

1393
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,512
Laird, you know
we had a wet nurse.

1394
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,680
Oh, I can tell.

1395
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,176
Boy, I'll tell you,
I don't know what's going on.

1396
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
I'm lost.

1397
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,594
I'm overwhelmed.
Yeah! Me, too.

1398
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,637
There's bukkake
floating all around me.

1399
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,875
What?
Hm?

1400
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,155
What's bukkake?

1401
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,355
Oh, Laird told me.

1402
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,033
It means when
you're overwhelmed

1403
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,360
and you got too much going on.

1404
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,198
Oh, my gosh.
Can't figure things out.

1405
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,669
Then, I'm drowning in bukkake
at this point.

1406
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,976
Okay, I'm gonna be
real with you guys.

1407
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,080
It means jizz on your face.

1408
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,520
I'm sorry?

1409
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,033
Bukkake means
covered in jizz.

1410
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,394
Tons of jizz, ejaculate.

1411
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,959
Usually after a gangbang.

1412
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,348
Not as bad as it sounds.

1413
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,714
Yeah,
post-gangbang.

1414
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,633
Or during. Depends
if someone finishes early.

1415
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,909
What the heck?

1416
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,216
I was trying to
protect you, dude.

1417
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,832
- Protect me?
- Fucking Justine.

1418
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,149
You mean embarrass me?

1419
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,656
It was a really
sensitive conversation.

1420
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,696
I didn't want
to start talking

1421
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,816
about guys jerking off
on each other.

1422
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,336
Why'd you tell me
it was overwhelming?

1423
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,509
Justine brought it up!

1424
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,194
I hope this is an opportune
time to show a video.

1425
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
It's not.

1426
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,674
- Oh, God!
- Yeah.

1427
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,518
Oh, and this
is a teaching moment.

1428
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,999
- Here's another.
- Oh, my God.

1429
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,336
- No. Scotty.
- Don't look at that.

1430
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,157
It's all good.
You don't have to see this.

1431
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,878
Is that you?

1432
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,395
No.

1433
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,828
Oh, my God.

1434
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,998
We alive right now, now

1435
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,039
Let's get hot right now

1436
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,477
We don't give a damn
about money

1437
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,913
We alive right now

1438
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,311
All we do is party, party

1439
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,515
And get hot right now

1440
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,073
Are you okay?

1441
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,955
Yeah!

1442
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,553
Come on, Daddy.
You're okay!

1443
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,557
Okay, I just need to
take a breather. One...

1444
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,594
Do it again...

1445
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,318
Lost my mind,
I'm a lose it again

1446
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,038
I love this kid.

1447
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,395
Oh, my God!

1448
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,033
Rage, rage the night away

1449
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,712
Forget about the money
I spent today

1450
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,512
Rage, rage the night away

1451
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,398
DDT your ass.
I love you, dawg.

1452
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,436
Forget about the money
I spent today

1453
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,235
Hi, Pops.

1454
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,360
I just need some fresh air.
Can I come?

1455
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,754
We've always been straight
with each other, haven't we?

1456
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920
Yeah, of course.

1457
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,336
Okay, I need to
ask you a question.

1458
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,475
And I mean this honestly.

1459
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,834
Okay. What?

1460
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You're scaring me.

1461
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,149
No. It's just...

1462
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,360
What?

1463
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,634
Why Laird?

1464
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,153
I mean, come on.
Oh, my God.

1465
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,912
Why?
Dad.

1466
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,111
You are so smart
and you're beautiful.

1467
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,475
You could be dating anyone.
Why?

1468
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't get it.
You want the truth?

1469
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,269
Yes.

1470
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,631
He kind of reminds me of you.

1471
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
What?

1472
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,469
Me?
Yes.

1473
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,398
Okay, I need you
to explain that one.

1474
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
How?

1475
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,154
You're both the most honest
and authentic men that I know.

1476
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,776
It comes out
in totally different ways.

1477
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Oh, well...

1478
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,313
Laird has literally no filter.

1479
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,034
I don't know that to be true.
Is that right?

1480
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,713
Okay.
Sorry.

1481
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,836
Trying to help you out here.

1482
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,839
But I swear his heart
is always in the right place.

1483
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,352
He's a very good guy.

1484
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,833
And I love him.

1485
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,880
You love him?

1486
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,994
What?

1487
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,233
I'm processing.

1488
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,560
We had the...
Very funny, Dad.

1489
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,157
Okay. Okay.

1490
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,558
Just try to be cordial.

1491
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,755
I will. I'll try.

1492
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,592
Okay? I'll try.
Try to what?

1493
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,398
I'll try to just...

1494
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,032
...understand
that person better.

1495
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,720
Come here.

1496
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,755
Hey.

1497
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Hi.

1498
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,712
Long night.
What are you doing?

1499
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,599
Just chilling.

1500
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,636
Barb, is that my shirt?

1501
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,711
I don't know, is it?

1502
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,438
Want me to take it off?

1503
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,114
Would you, please?
I only brought two dress shirts.

1504
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,554
I really don't feel
like ironing

1505
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,073
while I'm on this trip.

1506
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,558
I'm so exhausted.

1507
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,629
Oh, yeah.

1508
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,119
Take it off, baby.

1509
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,716
Yeah! Take it off.
Take off those shoes, girl.

1510
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,156
Let me see those feet.
I wanna see those feet!

1511
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,680
Did you hit your head
or something?

1512
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,109
Yeah. Let me
smell that shoe.

1513
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,256
You don't wanna
smell my shoe.

1514
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,280
Yeah, I want feet!

1515
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,436
I want those feet
out of those socks.

1516
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,919
Barb, what happened to you?

1517
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,957
I am so stoned right now.

1518
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
What?

1519
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,310
Yeah, I am so baked.

1520
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,277
I am like super baked.

1521
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,635
Barb. What?
Where did you?

1522
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,439
I was very lonely
after you guys left.

1523
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,912
And I saw this guy,
and he had a cigarette.

1524
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,514
I thought it was one of those
electronic cigarettes.

1525
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,749
They're called E-cigs.

1526
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
Yeah.

1527
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,797
But turns out...

1528
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,791
I was vaping.

1529
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,995
What?

1530
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,474
I was vaping.

1531
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
What is that?

1532
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,758
It's marijuana that comes
out of some kind of machine.

1533
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,632
Keep your voice down!
Ned, it's legal.

1534
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,633
Oh, this poor boy
had it for sleep apnea.

1535
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,638
At his age? So sad.
I'm going to bed. That's it.

1536
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,717
No, no, no. Wait!

1537
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,136
- Barbara, I'm tired.
- Wait a minute.

1538
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,160
And I've got a headache.

1539
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,311
Let's play a little bit, huh?
No, no.

1540
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,630
I'll give you
one of my patented massages.

1541
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,119
Barb.
Let's take the Little Cheese

1542
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,315
out for a spin.
No, no, no.

1543
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,880
Come on, let me just see him.
Don't.

1544
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,616
I just want to see him.
Don't call him that.

1545
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,709
Please. Come on.

1546
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,915
Oh, my God!

1547
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,560
You used to love getting high
and fooling around.

1548
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,119
What? Barb! No, Barb.

1549
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,016
We're on vacation!
But someone could walk...

1550
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,519
There's no locks
on the door!

1551
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,680
What?

1552
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,559
Justine! Do you have any Kiss?

1553
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,358
Oh, hell yeah!

1554
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,839
Are you kids gonna do it?
Yes.

1555
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,190
No.
We're doing it already.

1556
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,634
We're doing it right now.
Barb!

1557
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,200
I'm doing it with my feet.
One foot.

1558
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,356
That's Kiss!
Honey, you love Kiss!

1559
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,919
But not right now.

1560
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,349
Ned was made for loving Barb

1561
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,555
Yell!

1562
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,958
Yeah. Yeah.

1563
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,136
Look what I learned
at the party.

1564
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
What?

1565
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,560
There was this real cute girl,
and she was going like this.

1566
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,032
She was doing this cute,
new dance.

1567
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,878
You're gonna
throw your back out.

1568
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,678
I'm not gonna throw my...

1569
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,909
I'll throw you out.

1570
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,800
Let me get on you.
Wait, do you smell that?

1571
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,432
I'm putting him in.
What is that scent?

1572
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,749
There. Oh, it's in.

1573
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,552
What is that?
Oh, my God.

1574
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,755
Oh, my God!

1575
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,918
Is that Indian Summer
by Priscilla Presley?

1576
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,230
I used to wear
that perfume in the 90s.

1577
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,231
Yup, pumping some in.

1578
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,119
I saw you mentioned it on your
college reunion's Facebook page.

1579
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,918
I know what you like, Ned.

1580
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,957
Oh, I know you do, dawg.

1581
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,350
Yeah, get in there. Get it!

1582
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,039
Barb!
Get you some!

1583
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,952
Get it! Good. Oh, that's...
Okay.

1584
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,599
Yeah. You're almost in there.

1585
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,591
No, you're, like,
six inches away from it.

1586
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,035
Get in there.
Yeah, that's the spirit.

1587
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,753
Barb.
Oh! Yeah!

1588
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,920
Barb!
That's good.

1589
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,911
Oh, that's good.
You're getting into it now.

1590
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,235
- That's it!
- No!

1591
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,470
No, no!
Take me! Yes! Take me!

1592
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,709
I'm not...
Take me.

1593
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,776
I'm taking you right to bed.
That's what I'm doing.

1594
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,074
Here you go. Yes.

1595
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,275
No, I wanna do sex.

1596
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,776
We are not gonna do sex.
No, honey.

1597
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,915
But I want to.

1598
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,376
Justine, turn all the music
off please...

1599
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,435
I wanna do it.

1600
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,136
...and leave us alone
for the rest of the night.

1601
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,388
It's gonna be
full penetration!

1602
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,788
Would you stop!

1603
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,632
Psst... Hey, girl.

1604
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,639
Fifth button from the right.

1605
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,279
You'll thank me later.

1606
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,760
Mama, won't you please let me
Mama, won't you please let me

1607
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,994
Mmm...

1608
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,320
Mama, won't you please let me

1609
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,395
Mama do the hump
mama do the hump hump

1610
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,835
Mama won't you please
let me do the hump hump

1611
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,309
Mama do the hump
mama do the hump hump

1612
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,835
Mama won't you please
let me do the hump hump

1613
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,315
Mama do the hump
mama do the hump hump

1614
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,675
Mama won't you please
let me do the hump hump

1615
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,149
Mama do the hump
mama do the hump hump

1616
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,629
Mama won't you please
let me do the hump hump

1617
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,034
There we go, girls.

1618
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,440
Oh!

1619
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,549
Okay. You all right?

1620
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,233
Yeah. Oh, man.

1621
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,435
That's it.

1622
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,856
Dude, I thought
I was gonna make it.

1623
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,393
I know. You almost did, but...

1624
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,599
Very good evasive parkour.

1625
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,392
Yes, but the last move
you ate shit.

1626
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,675
I know.

1627
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,096
I'll put you
on the table later

1628
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,400
and we'll do
a little adjustment.

1629
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,593
Ah!

1630
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,436
Christmas tree shopping
with the Big Cheese.

1631
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,750
Ned, you don't know
how excited I am about this.

1632
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,876
I don't know
if I ever mentioned this,

1633
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,200
but I never had a father
to do this kind of stuff with.

1634
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,589
I'm glad we're getting
a chance to hang out.

1635
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,635
That's nice.

1636
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,751
Uh, it's not getting me hard.

1637
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,075
You need an erection
to buy a Christmas tree?

1638
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,640
Helps.

1639
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,953
I wanna get to
know you better.

1640
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,439
I mean, you're so perfect.

1641
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,353
Seriously, did you always
have your shit together?

1642
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,440
Oh, heck no.

1643
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,312
I got fired selling Datsuns.

1644
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,789
How'd you fuck up
selling little dogs?

1645
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,951
No. Datsuns.

1646
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,675
What's that?

1647
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,909
It's a car. Doesn't matter.

1648
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,354
It doesn't exist anymore.

1649
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,999
But you're still here.

1650
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,831
You ever get nervous
about shifting tides?

1651
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,629
Well, you know, every business
has its ups and downs.

1652
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,358
Yeah, I know it, bro.

1653
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,988
Guerrilla Gang, it's been
struggling a little bit.

1654
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,153
Really?

1655
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,595
Yeah, it's just a fucking
tough landscape, dude.

1656
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,510
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

1657
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,472
Whoa.

1658
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,668
Chills. Did you
come up with that?

1659
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,159
No, Laird.

1660
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,320
Whoa, whoa.

1661
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,039
There she blows, Ned.

1662
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,198
It's our motherfucking tree.

1663
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,630
Why not? It'll look great
opposite your moose.

1664
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,396
Ned, Ned. Not that one.

1665
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,994
That one.

1666
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,958
Oh, no. See, Laird...

1667
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,513
that doesn't belong
to this lot.

1668
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
See, it's owned by...

1669
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,671
Wet games?
Wewt Games.

1670
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,068
Like, 'woot-woot'.

1671
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,633
I know those dudes.
They're dicks.

1672
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,392
Tried to rip off
Ape Assassins.

1673
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,835
Plus, it's the first Christmas
with the family, dude.

1674
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Gotta do it right.

1675
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
Hey, buddy.

1676
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Yeah.

1677
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,673
Can I borrow that chainsaw?

1678
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,875
Are you serious?

1679
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,520
Yeah.

1680
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,191
Fucking...

1681
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,035
Come on.

1682
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,869
Will you hurry up?

1683
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,553
I'm trying.

1684
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,029
Come on, guy.
I need my chainsaw back.

1685
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,553
Just give me a second.

1686
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,960
Should we call
an ambulance now,

1687
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,393
or wait till
he loses a finger?

1688
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,549
Can I borrow those?

1689
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,669
Have at it.

1690
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,759
Okay. Laird just...

1691
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,989
Okay.

1692
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Hand it over?

1693
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,235
You sure, Ned?
Yup.

1694
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,518
Oh!

1695
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,917
Total fucking Dad move!

1696
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,789
Oh, shit!

1697
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,480
You keep on dancing
and the room gets hot

1698
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,311
You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

1699
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,392
I wanna rock and roll
all night...

1700
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,232
Love Kiss!

1701
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,279
Kiss, baby!

1702
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,839
These guys are awesome!

1703
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,639
Stephanie and I do karaoke
to Kiss all the time.

1704
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,796
Dude, I know,
that's why I put it on!

1705
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,791
And we do
a pretty good job, too,

1706
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,109
if I might say so.
Oh, man.

1707
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,232
That's cute.
Yeah.

1708
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,594
Listen, Laird,
I've been thinking about

1709
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,272
our teepee talk yesterday.

1710
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,959
Oh, dude, me too.

1711
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,951
I've got so many ideas
for the proposal.

1712
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,951
No.
No. Ned, hear me out.

1713
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,315
I was thinking about
getting the Goodyear blimp,

1714
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,560
releasing a thousand doves.

1715
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,675
No. Wait.

1716
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,200
Laird, just hold on
a second, okay?

1717
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,320
Slow down.
Okay.

1718
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,110
Look, I get it that Stephanie
really likes you.

1719
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,280
But...
Uh-huh.

1720
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,638
Look. Man to man.
Yeah.

1721
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,360
Now is not the time.

1722
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,592
Dude, Ned, I thought we were
getting past all that.

1723
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,153
No, it's not me.

1724
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,469
It's all about Stephanie.

1725
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,709
Stephanie?
Yes.

1726
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,840
I don't know, dude.

1727
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,992
These last few semesters
are gonna be so intense.

1728
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,639
And then there's graduation,

1729
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,994
and she'll be
looking for a job.

1730
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,680
And who knows
where that will take her.

1731
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,353
It's just...
All right, Ned...

1732
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,816
I wasn't supposed to
tell you this,

1733
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,558
but I just wanna
put your mind at ease.

1734
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,153
Stephanie is not going back
to school next semester.

1735
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,840
What?

1736
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,949
Dude, I know you're probably
shocked, but do not worry.

1737
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,832
She's already
got this awesome job

1738
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,512
lined up
at this non-profit.

1739
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,035
What organization
is that exactly?

1740
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,869
She's going to be president of
the Laird Mayhew Foundation.

1741
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,239
That's me.

1742
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,189
Stephanie!

1743
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,360
Barb?

1744
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,074
Everybody upstairs right now,
family meeting!

1745
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,896
Ned, would you like
me to schedule a meeting?

1746
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,955
Oh, fuck off!

1747
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,040
Just trying to help.

1748
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,576
You don't always have to be
such an asshole.

1749
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,828
Yes, I do!

1750
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,391
Dad.
You are so dead.

1751
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,994
Shut up. Of course
I was going to tell you.

1752
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,679
I told Mom yesterday
at the mall.

1753
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,856
I was just waiting for
the right time to bring it up

1754
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,216
and that hasn't happened.
Wait a minute.

1755
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,240
You knew?

1756
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,399
Honestly, honey, we thought
you might freak out.

1757
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,437
So we decided to wait until

1758
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,755
after Christmas
to bring it up.

1759
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,960
But, okay, he told you
about the foundation, right?

1760
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,872
Yes.
Yes, okay.

1761
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,376
This is a big part of
why I wanted you

1762
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,436
to come out here
and meet Laird.

1763
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,949
Stephanie, even if he wasn't
this abject lunatic,

1764
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,235
which he is,

1765
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,278
I still wouldn't
understand why.

1766
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,959
You've only got
a few semesters left

1767
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,195
before you graduate.

1768
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,072
Why would you
just throw that away?

1769
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,576
I'm not throwing
anything away, Dad.

1770
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,736
The year I spent
in Central America

1771
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,079
doing this kind of work,

1772
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,430
I know you think that I'm
making some rash decision

1773
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,600
and I'm not.

1774
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,115
We've spent months
figuring it out.

1775
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,508
All the months

1776
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,716
where you didn't even tell us
you had a boyfriend.

1777
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,880
All those months?

1778
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,753
Darling...

1779
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,439
I think you should
hear her out

1780
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,955
because it actually sounds
very interesting.

1781
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,080
Does it?

1782
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,111
Are you
willing to listen to me?

1783
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,280
Give it your best shot.

1784
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,793
The plan is to focus
on women's health

1785
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,776
as a function of environmental
change in the Third World.

1786
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Right.
All right.

1787
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,976
And when all that
goes belly-up,

1788
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,200
you know what
you're left with?

1789
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,276
What?
Being a college dropout.

1790
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,959
That's it.
You don't get it.

1791
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,120
Oh, I don't get it?

1792
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,952
No, you just, like,
don't get it at all.

1793
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,799
Oh. What is that?

1794
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,429
It's a tattoo.

1795
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,953
With his name?
You got a tattoo?

1796
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,116
You've marked your body
with his name on it.

1797
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,349
Look at that, Barb!

1798
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,953
Oh, no.

1799
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,832
That is so cute.

1800
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,280
Let me see.
I wanna see.

1801
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,200
Laird's been telling me
I should get a neck tat.

1802
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,588
I see what
Laird is doing here.

1803
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,600
I see what he's doing.

1804
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,150
He is trying to put his
imprint on this entire family.

1805
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,437
And that is why we've got
all these secrets now.

1806
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,999
And it's all because of him!

1807
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,037
Why do you have such
a big problem with Laird?

1808
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,031
Great question.
You know why? Why?

1809
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,156
Because of his influence,

1810
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,673
you drop out of college.

1811
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,035
Because of his influence,
you get a "too."

1812
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,320
Dad, I think you mean "tat."

1813
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,440
You definitely mean "tat."

1814
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,616
I mean "tat?"
It's not a "too?"

1815
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,776
"Tat." No, it's not a "too."
No.

1816
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,313
No, I saw it on Geraldo.

1817
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,232
They call them "toos," okay?
Okay.

1818
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,470
This is what's going to be
your downward spiral.

1819
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,232
First you get a tattoo,

1820
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,992
then you start vaporizing.

1821
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,792
- What?
- You're vaporizing.

1822
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,518
What are you talking about?

1823
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,638
When you have...
It's an e-cigarette.

1824
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,473
But instead of tobacco
or a fake tobacco,

1825
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,358
no, you have marijuana
in that e-cigarette.

1826
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,748
Dad, I know what it is.
Yeah.

1827
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,319
How do you know
what it is?

1828
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,358
Because I've been around.
Haven't I?

1829
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,195
Mm-hmm.

1830
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,952
Then you go
from there to heroin.

1831
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,075
Mm-hmm, that's right.

1832
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,470
After that, after you
get hooked on drugs,

1833
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,640
you know what happens next?

1834
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
What?

1835
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,856
You'll become a hooker,
a prostitute...

1836
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,995
a pimp's bitch.

1837
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,752
That's what's
going to happen to you.

1838
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,194
I see it very clearly.

1839
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,868
Oh, my...
How long do I have?

1840
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,917
I'm glad you asked.
Not long.

1841
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,231
You keep going down this path,
at this rate, not long.

1842
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,868
You're clearly not in a place
to listen to me right now.

1843
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,080
So I'm gonna go.

1844
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,560
Thank you, Pops,
for the guidance.

1845
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,914
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1846
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,438
When the line froze,
what did I see?

1847
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,115
A bad mother fucker
standing next to me

1848
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,435
Boom!

1849
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,949
Be free like a bird
so today I'ma fly

1850
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,588
Bad, bad motherfucker
'til the day I die

1851
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,592
Boss, let me
get this straight.

1852
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,875
You want me
to hack into

1853
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,791
Stephanie's
boyfriend's computer

1854
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,552
and find out
if there's any record

1855
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,119
of him starting a foundation?

1856
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,320
Yes, I do.

1857
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,391
Listen, Kevin,
you are my IT guy.

1858
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,680
I've got nowhere else to turn.

1859
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,149
You know I've always thought
so highly of Stephanie.

1860
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,629
Yeah, she thinks
a lot about you.

1861
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,677
Really? Oh, yeah.

1862
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,637
That's so crazy.
Now, listen.

1863
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,176
I know that this character
has money,

1864
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,120
but there's something about
this whole foundation

1865
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,480
that sounds like
a bunch of hooey.

1866
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,030
If this guy's running hooey,
then I'm gonna find out.

1867
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,400
Okay,
first thing's first, Ned,

1868
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,038
you have to break into
his computer

1869
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,839
and download a program
that I'm gonna send you.

1870
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,319
That's hacking?

1871
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,990
I took a shower,
washing every body part...

1872
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,357
Yeah, okay.
I'm getting online.

1873
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,991
Kevin, what are you doing?
Huh, baby?

1874
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,390
Oh, I'm helping Ned
with something IT-related.

1875
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,834
Oh, tell Ned I said hi.

1876
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Okay.

1877
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,080
All right, webcam's on.

1878
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,760
Okay, I'm in the office.

1879
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,836
All right, now get
in front of the computer.

1880
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,918
All right, good.
Press the spacebar.

1881
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,351
Oh, darn.
It's asking for a password.

1882
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,480
No surprise.

1883
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,195
A lot of guys have passwords related
to their girlfriends or their wives.

1884
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,878
Kevin, you're a genius.
That's what I have!

1885
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,873
It's "Barbsguy1989."
The year we were married.

1886
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,348
The younger generation tends
to go a little bit racier.

1887
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,320
I'm gonna get into some
sensitive areas here,

1888
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,719
so just bear with me.

1889
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,270
We need to focus on Stephanie's
more defining qualities

1890
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,078
that this guy
might latch onto.

1891
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,600
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1892
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,392
Would you just get to it?

1893
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,391
For example, like,
would you say...

1894
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,516
Stephanie has perky breasts?

1895
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,389
What?
Okay.

1896
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,198
I would say yes,
because she does.

1897
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,874
Please try "Stephanie's boobs"
one word, no caps.

1898
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,075
I'm her dad!

1899
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,912
I understand that
you're her dad,

1900
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,672
but you gotta think like him.

1901
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,915
Okay?

1902
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,760
No.

1903
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,438
We're gonna have to
kick it up a notch.

1904
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,278
You said that
this guy was edgy?

1905
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,434
Please try
"Stephanie's tight ass."

1906
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,595
Give that a whirl.

1907
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,631
Are you messing with me,
Dingle?

1908
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,711
I wish I was messing with you.

1909
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,074
I'm trying to help you, Ned.

1910
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,475
Make the two "S's"
dollar signs in "ass."

1911
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,755
God!

1912
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,275
I am going straight to hell
just for typing this.

1913
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,112
Tight ass.

1914
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,878
No.
Hey, guys?

1915
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,760
Do you wanna raise the volume
on the movie?

1916
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Okay.

1917
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,719
Okay. I'm just gonna list
some off, you type them in.

1918
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,430
All right,
try "Stephanie's sweet slit."

1919
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,591
I am not writing that!

1920
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,472
Okay,
"Stephanie's pink canoe."

1921
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,680
No!

1922
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,080
Listen, this isn't fun for me.

1923
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,599
Oh, my God.
What is it?

1924
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,159
It's the password!

1925
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,356
The one piece of paper
in the entire house.

1926
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,936
What does it say?
I'm gonna log it in.

1927
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,110
"Stephanie's dude."

1928
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,197
Aw, that's actually sweet.

1929
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,509
"2016."

1930
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,680
Boom! We're in.

1931
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
Oh, gosh!

1932
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,149
What? What is it?

1933
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,276
It's a nude photograph
of Stephanie.

1934
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,998
May I see it, please?
No.

1935
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,160
May I please see it?

1936
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,753
I said no!
Okay.

1937
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,840
Go to your EarthLink account
in the web browser.

1938
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,634
EarthLink, EarthLink, okay.
Press.

1939
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,309
I give it my password.

1940
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,675
Okay.

1941
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,952
Okay.
I just emailed you a file.

1942
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,951
Download that and
open it on his desktop.

1943
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,870
Ned, we're gonna fucking nail this guy!
We're good!

1944
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,513
We're hacking, baby!

1945
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,874
We're gonna nail him.

1946
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,280
We're gonna nail him the way
he's been nailing Stephanie.

1947
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,536
Just come with me right now.

1948
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,560
What?

1949
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,696
Why are you
taking me to my office?

1950
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,755
Everyone's downstairs.

1951
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,478
Oh, shit! Someone's coming!
Okay. Escape!

1952
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,595
Oh, God!

1953
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,880
Baby,
what are we doing?

1954
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,313
Christmas Eve
is about to start.

1955
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,280
What is the matter with you?
What's happening?

1956
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,816
I specifically told you...
Don't say anything.

1957
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,196
that I wanted to be the one to
tell my dad about Stanford.

1958
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,200
I know. We were just...
Then why did you do it?

1959
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,669
We were bonding so hard,
it just sort of slipped out.

1960
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,638
You clearly have no
idea what this means to him.

1961
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,229
He was so proud of me
when I got into Stanford.

1962
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,359
He worked so hard
to make it happen.

1963
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,035
Me dropping out is like
a huge slap in his face.

1964
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,920
Okay.

1965
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,235
I just never had anyone
like him in my life before.

1966
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,879
Oh, my God!

1967
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,511
I thought we could
just talk it out.

1968
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,240
You could see how that's not
your place to do that, right?

1969
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,509
Okay. Maybe not.

1970
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,829
Definitely not.

1971
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,355
Okay, you're right.
He was super pissed.

1972
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,431
Sometimes I feel like
you're not capable

1973
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,238
of being in a relationship.

1974
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,675
It's time that
you get a handle

1975
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,600
on these father issues.

1976
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,715
Wow.

1977
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,393
That's the truth.

1978
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,435
When you call me
on my shit...

1979
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,434
My God! It makes me
feel so close to you.

1980
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,797
Your honesty has
such an effect on me.

1981
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,435
You're making me so
fucking horny right now.

1982
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,949
- What?
- Yeah.

1983
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,598
That face is boner-bait.

1984
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,600
Can you not see
that I'm mad at you?

1985
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,176
Yeah, I see it.
That's what's...

1986
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,856
Oh, my God.
You're driving me crazy!

1987
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,711
You're not listening to me.

1988
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,640
I'm listening.

1989
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,554
I'm sorry.

1990
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,789
Do you...

1991
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,639
You need therapy.

1992
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,308
Not working.
No?

1993
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,754
Mm-mm. Not today, buddy.

1994
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,319
Okay. How about this?

1995
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,075
Is this working?

1996
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,554
A little bit.

1997
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,429
Okay, how about this?

1998
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,676
Okay. That's working
a little bit more.

1999
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,398
Laird,
I love you.

2000
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,919
But I'm still
mad at you.

2001
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,433
I'm sorry.

2002
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,678
I'm so sorry.
No, no!

2003
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,120
Okay?

2004
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,360
Yes!

2005
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,480
No!

2006
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,480
You...

2007
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,016
I'm gonna make it up to you.
What is happening?

2008
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,560
You just lie back, and I'll give you
an early Christmas present.

2009
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,636
You are
such a freak.

2010
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,949
I know.

2011
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,875
Here comes Santa.

2012
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,040
Oh, really?

2013
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,151
Ho, ho, ho.
Oh, my God.

2014
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,514
Merry Christmas.

2015
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,313
Somebody's been
naughty this year.

2016
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,835
Boss?

2017
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,195
Ned. Are you there? Hello?

2018
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,320
Hello?
Oh.

2019
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,994
Yes. Kevin, I'm here.
What's happening?

2020
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,120
I'm in.

2021
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,680
Do you have access
to the Internet?

2022
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,199
Yes, I do. Hold on.

2023
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,634
Wait a second.

2024
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,392
Log into your
EarthLink account.

2025
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,480
Okay. Got it.

2026
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,677
I'm gonna send these
to you right now.

2027
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,796
Good.
You're done, Mayhew.

2028
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,355
What the fuck?

2029
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,832
What happened?
Oh, my God.

2030
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,319
Wait, what?
What's going on?

2031
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,630
I don't know. He has my face.

2032
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,856
What do you mean
he has your face?

2033
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,880
I'm locked out.

2034
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,353
I can't use
my computer anymore.

2035
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,480
What?
Stop that!

2036
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,000
What's happening?
He's onto us, Ned.

2037
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,040
What are you doing?

2038
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,760
We have to abort.
Oh, God. Oh, no.

2039
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,071
Move back, motherfuckers
Mayhew's here

2040
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,200
Oh, fuck!

2041
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,440
He's a mythical creature, Ned.

2042
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,520
He's what?

2043
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,073
What the fuck? Oh, God.

2044
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,077
He's pulling out his penis!

2045
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,433
Oh, my God.

2046
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,511
He's balls deep
in my digital butt.

2047
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,216
Are you watching porn?

2048
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,355
Turn that off!

2049
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,589
Ned, he's doing it!

2050
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,553
Marnie, it's not good!

2051
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,558
Stay the fuck out!
Turn that off!

2052
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,755
Kevin!

2053
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,920
Kevin!

2054
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,239
He has control of the house!

2055
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,435
Come here!

2056
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,376
Kevin, what is happening?
We gotta get out of here!

2057
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,400
Go, go, go!

2058
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,600
- What?
- Kevin!

2059
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,079
Kevin!

2060
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,876
Oh, my...

2061
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,639
Silent night

2062
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,509
Holy night

2063
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,676
All is calm

2064
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,508
All is bright

2065
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,468
Hi.
Hey.

2066
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,999
You know what?
Let's not fight.

2067
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,115
Okay.

2068
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,680
I'm sorry, truly, that you found out
about Stanford that way.

2069
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,760
Thank you.

2070
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,720
It was not okay of Laird,
and he knows that now.

2071
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,256
But I'm confident
this is a really good idea.

2072
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,936
Honey, before you continue,
I need to tell you something.

2073
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,599
Laird has been lying to you.

2074
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,160
I tried.

2075
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,759
No, no, no. Hey!
It's unbelievable!

2076
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,797
He is in serious
financial trouble.

2077
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,757
In what way?
It's Christmas.

2078
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,148
Ned, you're making a mistake.

2079
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,595
He doesn't have enough money
to finance his business,

2080
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,079
let alone a foundation.

2081
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,856
What exactly
makes you think that?

2082
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,199
Wait till you see this.

2083
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,475
What's this?
Here.

2084
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,551
Look at this,
his own bank records.

2085
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,233
All in red.

2086
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,349
Is this for real?

2087
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,589
Yeah, it's true.

2088
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,360
Guerrilla Gang hasn't crushed
one in a couple of years.

2089
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,078
So you lied to me?

2090
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,434
I'm dropping out of school

2091
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,960
to start a foundation that
you're supposed to be financing.

2092
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,109
Yeah.
Yeah.

2093
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,350
Baby, the foundation
is all good.

2094
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,278
What are you talking about?

2095
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,790
Ned, there has been
a very big misunderstanding.

2096
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,918
These are only
Laird's business holdings.

2097
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,080
On the personal side...

2098
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,376
I have put together
a moderate,

2099
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,231
conservative private
equity sleeve

2100
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,277
that has been
performing delightfully.

2101
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,032
You could say that again.
Mm-hmm.

2102
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,599
So you followed
the Buffett rule?

2103
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,880
Always, dude.

2104
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,752
70/30, stocks to bonds.

2105
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:26,840
Buffet.

2106
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,960
Nice.

2107
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,136
Your little hacker, Dingle...

2108
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,160
Hacker?

2109
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,992
...was worming down
the wrong hole.

2110
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,549
- Does he mean Kevin Dingle?
- Probably.

2111
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,079
No, must be another Dingle.

2112
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,674
Only dingle I know of
is the berries on the butt.

2113
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,637
Look, how much money
do you have?

2114
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,816
Babe, you don't
have to answer this.

2115
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,909
Yes, he does.

2116
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,797
Fine! Full disclosure.

2117
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,154
It's bad.

2118
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,078
I'm down to
my last 97 million.

2119
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,918
Laird.

2120
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,271
197 million.

2121
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,875
Boom.

2122
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,155
He's just barely scraping by.

2123
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,480
All you had to do was ask me.

2124
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,636
Gentlemen, I need
Deck the Halls, allegro, now.

2125
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,873
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

2126
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,672
Ned, it's the holidays

2127
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,478
and I think
we should start over.

2128
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,189
So this is for you.

2129
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,320
What is it?

2130
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,600
It's a little
stocking stuffer.

2131
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,749
I think you'll like it.

2132
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,152
A phone?
Press the button.

2133
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,914
This is from my bank
in Grand Rapids.

2134
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,195
Merry Christmas.

2135
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,416
Someone fill me in here.

2136
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,440
Well, Steph...

2137
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,074
I bought
your father's company.

2138
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,795
Sort of.

2139
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,714
Ned, I purchased all your debt
as a Christmas present.

2140
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,199
What the fuck?

2141
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,517
You son of a bitch.
What?

2142
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,920
Dude, I'm trying to be nice,
so you can avoid bankruptcy.

2143
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,759
Are you guys
talking Chapter 11?

2144
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,160
I don't even wanna
hear that term.

2145
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,959
Okay, gentlemen,
I need Jingle Bells, and step on it!

2146
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,317
I can't believe that
you didn't tell us about this.

2147
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,550
What? No, it's just...

2148
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:01,228
The business has been running
a little rough lately.

2149
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,096
I'm already working on
a new deal right now.

2150
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,031
So you had no idea?
No.

2151
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,640
How the hell
did you know about this?

2152
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,797
It was Justine.
Oh.

2153
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,074
Yeah, it was me.

2154
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,976
She played me back a little bit of a
conversation you had the other day...

2155
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
with a guy named Lou.

2156
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,636
Of course,
I had to help.

2157
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,376
Ned,
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

2158
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,400
Yep.

2159
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,516
But I was really,
really worried about you.

2160
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,272
She was.
No clowning.

2161
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,953
And just so
you don't stress,

2162
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,469
you're still gonna be
the Big Cheese, dude.

2163
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,551
I plan on being
a very hands-off owner.

2164
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,108
So what do you say, partner?

2165
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,320
- Ned, what are you...
- What the fuck?

2166
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,357
Why would you do that, Dad?

2167
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Dad!

2168
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,919
Fuck you, paper man!

2169
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,959
Oh, scheisse.

2170
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,120
Ned, I'm sorry, bro.

2171
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,872
Are you okay? Oh, man.

2172
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,314
My training,
it just takes over.

2173
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,715
Everybody is feeling
a lot of tension.

2174
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,949
Calm down.
Dad!

2175
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,394
Or we can hit people square
in the face with an iPad.

2176
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,072
Disengage.
Disengage and run!

2177
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,336
Dude, that was kind of cool.
You gotta be honest.

2178
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,237
Ned, I love you.
I was just trying to help.

2179
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
Ooh!

2180
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,560
Laird, disengage him!

2181
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,153
Ned, let go of his balls!

2182
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,358
Laird! Evasive parkour!

2183
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,589
Laird, get away!

2184
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,711
Evasive parkour!
Do the wall pop!

2185
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,560
Wall pop!

2186
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,758
Goose! Did you see that?

2187
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,639
That's right! Because you
finally engaged your core!

2188
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,800
Get down here!

2189
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,696
You see the difference of the feeling?
How it feels differently?

2190
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,755
I know!

2191
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,835
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

2192
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,736
Don't breathe in.
I'll save you, brother!

2193
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,840
Scotty, no! Scotty!

2194
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
No, honey!

2195
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,920
I'm here to save you, Laird!

2196
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,669
Scotty, watch out!

2197
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,877
Laird! You okay?

2198
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Yeah!

2199
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,474
Fantastic!
You're okay.

2200
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,678
You're okay.
Wait. Where's Scotty?

2201
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,114
Scotty! Oh, my God.

2202
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,357
Scotty!
He's under the moose!

2203
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,976
He's under the moose!

2204
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,149
Scotty!

2205
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,240
Oh, shit.

2206
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,670
These fucking moose balls
are in my mouth.

2207
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,876
Oh, shit,
he's teabagging you, bro!

2208
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,359
I got you.

2209
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,189
Come here. Come here.

2210
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,032
Oh, my God. It's okay.

2211
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,200
It's okay.

2212
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,989
Honey, I'm so sorry
it turned out this way.

2213
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,160
Me, too.

2214
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,000
I'll call you
when I get home.

2215
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,111
Okay. Good luck with Scotty.

2216
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,359
Thank you. I'll need it.
Yeah.

2217
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,079
Steph, listen. I never...

2218
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,435
I'm done listening.
Have a safe flight.

2219
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,632
See you, sis.
Bye, Scotty.

2220
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,949
Can't believe I have to
go back to toilet paper.

2221
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,433
Hey, Don Millis.
Merry Christmas, sir.

2222
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,400
You too, Ned. Look, I hate
to call on Christmas.

2223
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,238
Oh, don't worry about that.

2224
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,152
It was great
catching up yesterday

2225
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,480
and I wanted to ring you
as soon as we made a decision.

2226
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,560
Okay.

2227
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,520
I talked with the group here
about your proposal

2228
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,192
and we just can't go for it.

2229
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,634
I'm sorry, pal.

2230
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,513
We really appreciate you offering
us such a sweetheart deal.

2231
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,296
But fact is we 're just not doing a
whole lot of printing these days.

2232
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,469
You know how it is.
Yes.

2233
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:35,776
It's a whole new world, right?

2234
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,800
Yes.

2235
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,755
Sure is.

2236
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,720
I sure wish we could've
done business, Cheese.

2237
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,159
All right, listen, um,

2238
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,715
if you're sure I can't
change your mind there, Don.

2239
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,108
Yeah, unfortunately not.

2240
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,992
Okay. All right.

2241
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,236
You have a happy holidays.
You, too, Ned!

2242
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,799
Best to Barb and the kids.

2243
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,239
Excuse me, Ned?

2244
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,358
I'm sorry to bother you,
but your flight leaves in an hour.

2245
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,676
Must seem strange
to you, my friend

2246
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,239
I'll miss you.

2247
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,630
Some things are always
heaven sent

2248
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,189
The more you want,
the harder it gets

2249
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,872
The more you let go,
the more you get

2250
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,439
It's a crazy...

2251
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,032
...beautiful life

2252
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,793
Some things make sense
and you don't know what

2253
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,391
It's a crazy beautiful life

2254
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,311
Welcome home, Flemings!

2255
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,595
Lou, what...

2256
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,789
You guys must be freezing.

2257
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,155
Come on, get in here.
Let me get that. Come on, Cheese.

2258
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,600
Lou, what's going on?
Barbara, hey.

2259
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,835
Hi.

2260
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,016
- Barb, you look great.
- There they are!

2261
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,508
Merry Christmas!

2262
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,909
Wow!

2263
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,830
Um, Lou, I texted you that
I needed to talk to you.

2264
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I mean, what's...

2265
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,151
Come on,
you hear this guy?

2266
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,759
Hank Rouse
from First National

2267
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,309
shot me a congratulatory
voicemail this morning

2268
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,839
about the
Mayhew deal.

2269
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
You did it,
Big Cheese!

2270
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,040
You pulled off
the Christmas miracle.

2271
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,156
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!

2272
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,435
Barb!

2273
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,440
Scotty.

2274
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,319
Ned, as a little token
of our appreciation,

2275
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,948
we all chipped in
and bought you something

2276
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,759
that we're pretty sure
you don't own.

2277
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,872
You shouldn't have.

2278
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,553
Open it. Yeah.

2279
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,280
Yeah, right there.

2280
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,790
It's an iPad.

2281
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,313
Hit the home button
right there.

2282
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,480
Yeah.

2283
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,856
We had a little fun
with that down in Graphics.

2284
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,030
I got the images off
Scotty's Facebook page.

2285
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,718
He looks like a stand-up guy.

2286
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,552
Like a younger version
of you, Ned.

2287
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,355
Make a speech!

2288
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,799
Speech!
Oh, yes, speech!

2289
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,319
Speech, speech, speech.

2290
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,074
The heck is that?

2291
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,515
Laird, a jet and
a helicopter? Where are we?

2292
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,199
Hang on, babe. Almost there.

2293
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,359
One second.
Mayhew!

2294
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,536
Guys, stay here
for a minute.

2295
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,696
Honey, go inside
and get a jacket.

2296
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,896
That's Mayhew.
Is that the guy?

2297
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:38,920
Laird!

2298
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,194
Where are we?

2299
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,360
That looks weird.

2300
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,920
It's kind of Fifty
Shades of Grey-ish.

2301
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,712
Cold?
Yeah.

2302
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,508
And here we go.

2303
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,594
Surprise!

2304
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,675
Hi, honey.

2305
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,195
Ta-da.

2306
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,278
You brought me home?
Yeah.

2307
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,078
Without telling me?

2308
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,550
I realize I violated the
sanctity of mystery date

2309
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,598
but I just thought the family
should all be together today.

2310
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,520
Okay, that wasn't your
place to do that, hon.

2311
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,471
Steph, I know,

2312
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,039
but it is Christmas.

2313
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,275
And we're glad
to see you.

2314
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,509
This isn't what
she wanted.

2315
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,669
No, it's not.

2316
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,318
What I wanted was
for us to spend

2317
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,799
Christmas in
California together

2318
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,394
like I planned, before
everything went to shit

2319
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,312
because you made it
all about yourself.

2320
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,469
Mm-hmm.

2321
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,388
You both did.

2322
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,754
I did?
Yes!

2323
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,918
You idiots think you can
pass me back and forth

2324
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,911
like I'm your property
or something?

2325
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I'm done.

2326
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,559
This is the worst
Christmas ever.

2327
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,432
Steph.
Steph. Honey.

2328
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,594
I think she's pissed.

2329
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,351
Yeah, she's pissed.

2330
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,480
Shit!

2331
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,753
I just thought that you guys
should be together today.

2332
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,355
All right.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

2333
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,633
Happy holidays, Ned.

2334
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,119
You too, Laird.

2335
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,759
Uh, Laird.

2336
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,951
You're doing a "I'm
gonna walk away slowly

2337
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,640
"'cause I really don't
wanna leave" walk.

2338
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,193
Maybe.

2339
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,640
Come here.

2340
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,949
Come here.

2341
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,997
So what happened?
You didn't propose?

2342
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,275
How could I?

2343
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,520
I never got
your permission

2344
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,471
and we pinky-swore
I wouldn't ask without it.

2345
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,358
You are remarkable.

2346
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,876
You don't have a gear
to be dishonest, do you?

2347
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,039
Guess not, dude.

2348
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,712
Laird, you never needed
my permission

2349
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,199
to ask Stephanie
to marry you.

2350
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,030
But if it still means
anything to you,

2351
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,549
you have my blessing.

2352
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,355
For reals?

2353
01:32:58,920 --> 01:32:59,920
No clowning.

2354
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,520
Whoa.

2355
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,709
But, Laird,
Stephanie's right.

2356
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,155
It's up to her.
It's always been up to her.

2357
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,309
Not us.

2358
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,240
It just took me a while
to realize that.

2359
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,715
It's so true.

2360
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,159
Dude, we were such jerks.

2361
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,509
Yeah.

2362
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:21,874
I bit your dick.

2363
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,672
Shaft and balls.
Oh.

2364
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,668
I'm sorry.

2365
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,918
I'm sorry, too, dude.

2366
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,192
Look, Laird, if you wanna
ask Stephanie to marry you

2367
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,396
when the time
is right, just do it.

2368
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,030
Okay. Is it cool
if I do it right now?

2369
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,430
Because, uh, just in case
it worked out

2370
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,717
I had Goose put a shit ton
of doves in the helicopter

2371
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,280
and I have
a couple other surprises.

2372
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,874
Laird, this is
totally your call.

2373
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,031
But can I give you
some advice?

2374
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,629
Dude, please.

2375
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,776
I'm so fucking
nervous right now.

2376
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,835
All right, look...

2377
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,196
Stephanie doesn't care about
all the bells and whistles.

2378
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,958
You know her.

2379
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,553
She cares about you.

2380
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,073
She loves you.

2381
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,437
So you get down
on one knee

2382
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,709
and you speak to her
from your heart.

2383
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,238
That's what
you're best at.

2384
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,390
Isn't that right,
Justine?

2385
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,399
Totally agree.

2386
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,960
Holy shit.

2387
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,233
My first time in Michigan.
It's cold as balls here.

2388
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,400
Yeah.

2389
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,795
Dude, that's
fucking great!

2390
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,749
Do it Ned Fleming style.

2391
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,478
Old school!

2392
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,749
Fuck yes.

2393
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,638
Okay. Well, look...

2394
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,816
I'll go in there and see if
I can get her to come out.

2395
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,840
Okay.

2396
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,632
Good luck.
Thanks.

2397
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,156
Hey, promise me
one thing.

2398
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,952
You will treat
her well.

2399
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,478
Dude, I'm gonna treat her
like a motherfucking queen.

2400
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,514
I'll take that.

2401
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,680
Okay.

2402
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,790
Gustav, change of plans.

2403
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,554
We're go on the proposal.
No go on all that other shit.

2404
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,640
I have only one bar.

2405
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,199
You're saying
we are a go, yes?

2406
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,952
No. No go.

2407
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,111
Go on the proposal,
no go on the shit.

2408
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,191
Laird, are you saying
it's a no go

2409
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,476
or are you saying, "No. Go."?

2410
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,629
God damn it, Goose.

2411
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,656
You're making me fucking
nervous. Just shut up.

2412
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,272
Oh, I'm sorry. Good luck.

2413
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,789
Oh, and by the way,
please, Laird, breathe.

2414
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,755
Okay.

2415
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,831
And no cursing, okay?

2416
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,513
Fuck, you're right. Good call.

2417
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,755
Hi.

2418
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,153
I'm sorry.

2419
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,315
I know that out in California
I disappointed you

2420
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,357
and that kills me.

2421
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,158
And I'm really sorry.

2422
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,680
I'm sorry, too.

2423
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,976
I threw you in the
deep end out there.

2424
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,400
I should've never
asked you to come.

2425
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
Honestly. No.

2426
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,079
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

2427
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,389
What was I thinking?

2428
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,675
It was me.

2429
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,069
It's just that, when we
got out to Laird's...

2430
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,398
I just didn't feel like
I knew you anymore

2431
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,032
and I got scared.

2432
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,518
I just went crazy.

2433
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,514
This is me.

2434
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,393
I'm doing good.

2435
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,399
Oh, Dad.

2436
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:33,640
Oh, my God.

2437
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,199
Okay, look. I forgot...

2438
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,416
Oh, God.
He's still out there.

2439
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,509
I know.

2440
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,856
In a tank top and a scarf.

2441
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,096
And he knew
we were coming to Michigan.

2442
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,120
Yeah.

2443
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,520
Why doesn't
he just come inside?

2444
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,896
He has to talk to you
about something...

2445
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,434
He kind of wants to make
things right with you.

2446
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,033
Oh, does he?
Yeah.

2447
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,272
I think it'd be cool
if you gave him a chance.

2448
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,549
You want me
to give Laird a chance?

2449
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:59,474
I thought that if you saw
fit to give him a chance...

2450
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:02,279
I thought that
it'd be cool.

2451
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,720
That's all. Well?

2452
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,432
Hi.
Hey.

2453
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,556
What's going on?
Oh, my God, it's cold out here.

2454
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,910
I know you're pissed,
but just hear me out.

2455
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,479
Can we talk inside?
No.

2456
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,640
Oh, my...
Look.

2457
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,399
Oh, my God.
It's so romantic.

2458
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,794
I told him to keep
it simple.

2459
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,154
Oh, our little girl.

2460
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,456
He's gonna get down to his
knee and keep it real simple.

2461
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,754
How do you know all this?

2462
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,069
I gave him
a few pointers.

2463
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,468
Oh.

2464
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,471
This has been the
happiest year of my life.

2465
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,591
And fly! Go, go, go! Go!

2466
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,271
Oh, no.
What?

2467
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,600
Ah.

2468
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,951
Oh, my God.

2469
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,156
Goose. God damn it.
I said no go! No go!

2470
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,355
Oh, my...

2471
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,475
Oh, gosh. Wow.

2472
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,656
Why did he do that?
Smart boy.

2473
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,716
Absolute fucking shit fest.

2474
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,438
Babe, I'm so
sorry. Uh...

2475
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,159
Stephanie Fleming...

2476
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,033
will you...
Are you proposing?

2477
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,997
Yeah.

2478
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,838
Mmm-hmm.

2479
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,279
Did my dad know
about this?

2480
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,592
Yeah, I asked
for his blessing

2481
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,113
that first morning
back in Cali.

2482
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,356
Oh, my God.

2483
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,795
Oh, my God!

2484
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,474
No wonder he acted
so crazy. Honey.

2485
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,551
Yeah, that's why he was
a little out of whack.

2486
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,790
Yeah, we could have had
a really nice holiday.

2487
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,673
I know. But we're all
good now. Okay?

2488
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,990
This is a lot.

2489
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,878
Oh, my God.
Stephanie Fleming...

2490
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,440
That's a ring.

2491
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,357
Goose! No!

2492
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,991
And, go! Go, guys!
Go, go, go!

2493
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,154
Stephanie!

2494
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,560
Oh, my God.

2495
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,830
Laird, what is Kiss
doing here?

2496
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,829
Um, well...

2497
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,075
Is that...
Whoa!

2498
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,394
He got look-a-likes!

2499
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,516
Those aren't
look-a-likes, Ned.

2500
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,874
That's Gene and Paul.

2501
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,032
It's Gene and Paul!
Gene and Paul!

2502
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,236
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

2503
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,799
Kiss is in
the front yard!

2504
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:20,428
Tonight

2505
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:23,029
I wanna give it all to you

2506
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,920
In the darkness

2507
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,753
Originally, I had this more
elaborate proposal plan

2508
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,592
but your dad gave me
this awesome advice

2509
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,869
and told me
not to do it.

2510
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,439
But they're here,

2511
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,437
and I know how much
you love their music, so...

2512
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,874
What? Hi.

2513
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:40,794
I was made
for lovin' you, baby

2514
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,714
You were made for lovin' me

2515
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,711
And I can't get...

2516
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,117
Is he still proposing?
What's...

2517
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:53,713
They've stopped
playing now.

2518
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,831
- His name's Ned.
- Oh, my God, are they...

2519
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:56,960
What?

2520
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,096
Are they coming in the...
Oh, my God.

2521
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,216
They're coming up
the sidewalk!

2522
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,240
They're heading in!

2523
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,880
They're coming in our house!
Oh, my God!

2524
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,831
Everybody act natural!
Act naturally!

2525
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,228
I have to redecorate
the house!

2526
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,749
Hey.

2527
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,920
Hi.

2528
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,115
Hi.

2529
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,429
Uh, hi.

2530
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,113
- I'm Ned.
- Hey, Ned.

2531
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,429
Hi!
Hi!

2532
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,192
This is my wife, Barb.

2533
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,759
This is our friends,
Lou and Patty.

2534
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:31,989
It's Lou.

2535
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,593
So excited
you're here.

2536
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,036
I gotta tell you.
Uh, we are huge fans.

2537
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,875
We've been members of the Kiss
Army for, like, 30 years now.

2538
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,679
Yeah. Our first date was
the Crazy Nights Tour.

2539
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,274
Yeah! And, boy,
was that crazy.

2540
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,429
Crazy.

2541
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,160
Did you get laid?

2542
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,480
Um...

2543
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:56,312
I gave him a handjob.

2544
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,873
Scotty.

2545
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,992
I'm having
an awesome time,

2546
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,473
but are you having
a buffet here?

2547
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,198
Oh, my God.
What was I thinking?

2548
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,793
Are you hungry?
Starving.

2549
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,712
Oh, God, of course!
Where's our manners?

2550
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,835
We're terrible hosts.

2551
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,136
Let's get those
guitars, guys.

2552
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:11,354
Come on,
let me get that axe.

2553
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,709
See my body?

2554
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,800
Wow! Kiss is
in our house!

2555
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,031
Yeah. I'm kind of
juiced up a little bit.

2556
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,357
Oh! I almost forgot
about them.

2557
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,351
Well...
The happy couple.

2558
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,999
Congratulations.

2559
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,839
She said no.

2560
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,720
I'm sorry, what?

2561
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,154
She said no.

2562
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,040
Well...

2563
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,869
Honey.

2564
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,158
I'm so flattered

2565
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,351
that you wanna marry me

2566
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:40,880
but I'm not ready
for that.

2567
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,719
And I'm gonna
finish school.

2568
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,199
For me.

2569
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,839
Because that's what
I wanna do.

2570
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,519
Got it?

2571
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,352
That's really smart.

2572
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:55,273
It's just,
I had this big plan

2573
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,674
and it didn't work out.

2574
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,590
Yeah.
Well, that's life, pal.

2575
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,233
That is so
well put, Ned.

2576
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,712
It's really,
really smart.

2577
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,552
Dude, did you
come up with that?

2578
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,358
The words, "That's life?"

2579
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:14,199
Ned, you're so full of
practical wisdom...

2580
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,176
I was just really
looking forward

2581
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,428
to you being
my father-in-law.

2582
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:18,640
Aw.

2583
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,631
I'm not breaking
up with you.

2584
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:22,800
You're not?

2585
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:23,920
No, honey.

2586
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,560
No, no, no.
I'm still your girlfriend.

2587
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,358
We're still together.

2588
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,440
Oh.

2589
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,074
Oh, thank God!

2590
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:32,275
Come here.

2591
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,389
Merry Christmas.

2592
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,560
Ned.
Hey.

2593
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,238
Dude, your employees
are so cool.

2594
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,674
Yeah, they are.

2595
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,990
Maybe it was wrong of me
to interfere like that,

2596
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,957
but why don't you
let me save your company?

2597
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,072
No, Laird,
I can't.

2598
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,231
That old model
doesn't work anymore.

2599
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,271
I guess...
I don't know.

2600
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,277
I guess I just didn't
want to believe it.

2601
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,758
But since you
mentioned it...

2602
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,070
I do have a business idea
I wanna run by you.

2603
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,793
Dude, elevator pitch me!

2604
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,154
Okay.

2605
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,794
No, hold on.

2606
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,315
This wasn't my idea at all.
One second.

2607
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,232
- Scotty, come here.
- Yo, what's up?

2608
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:18,320
Come here.
Yeah?

2609
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,936
I want you to tell Laird
about the business idea

2610
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,359
you mentioned
on the plane.

2611
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,520
Go ahead.
Wait, really?

2612
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,600
Yeah.

2613
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,400
Told you to get that seat
at the table, bro.

2614
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,040
You did. He told me,
Dad. He was, like...

2615
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,256
"You're gonna
get that seat."

2616
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,696
I can't believe
I finally got the seat.

2617
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,948
Dragons and
titties, baby.

2618
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,951
Dragons and titties!

2619
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,600
Breathe that fire.

2620
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,720
Get up in there.

2621
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,518
Get up
in those titties!

2622
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,000
Gonna get those dragons.

2623
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,949
Dad...

2624
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,799
Scotty!

2625
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,520
Stop motorboating your dad,
and elevator pitch me.

2626
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,119
Sorry. Uh...

2627
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,313
Laird, I can't stop thinking
about your toilets, dude.

2628
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,152
My toilets?
Yeah.

2629
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:54,958
The fresh feeling,
the scented talc.

2630
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,310
I was thinking if you can
get the controls in English

2631
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,240
and maybe lower the price
point a little bit,

2632
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,456
we could have
a potentially untapped

2633
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,480
market here in America.

2634
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,158
Oh, shit.
Right?

2635
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,976
And look, we can contact
a Japanese manufacturer

2636
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,035
about pricing...
Ooh.

2637
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,555
No, Scotty. Pardon my French,
but fuck that noise.

2638
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,195
Whoa.

2639
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,312
Listen. We have a factory
right here in Grand Rapids

2640
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,675
with 37 of the best employees
you're ever gonna want.

2641
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,751
Let's build our own.

2642
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,751
Hells yes, Grateful Ned!
Yeah!

2643
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,239
Boom!

2644
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,515
Okay, sorry. Yeah.

2645
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:35,876
The first noel
the angels did say

2646
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:41,393
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

2647
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:47,112
In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep

2648
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:52,798
On a cold winter's night
that was so deep

2649
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,518
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

2650
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:57,553
It turned out to be a pretty
cool holiday after all, huh?

2651
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,549
It did, son.

2652
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,480
Dude.

2653
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,040
What?

2654
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,000
Told you you'd be
calling me "son" by Christmas.

2655
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,837
Oh.

2656
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,717
That's just
a figure of speech.

2657
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,915
Sure, Dad.

2658
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:25,480
Merry Christmas,
I don't want to fight tonight

2659
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,233
Hello there, you gang!
It is I, Gustav.

2660
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,675
It's so great to see you!

2661
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,400
Hey, what do you think
of the new facial hair, huh?

2662
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,397
I'm based in Michigan now,
so you know...

2663
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,816
I'm trying to do this
whole kind of

2664
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,159
Paul Bunyan, Midwestern thing.

2665
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,440
I wanted to fill it all out.

2666
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:49,078
So Scotty, Laird, and Ned
took the printing company...

2667
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:50,456
turned it into
a toilet factory...

2668
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,959
and it's going great!

2669
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,998
The toilet is water efficient
und eco-friendly.

2670
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,479
It's state of the art.

2671
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,757
I'm telling you, they have
invented the Tesla of toilets!

2672
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,468
It's amazing.

2673
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,312
Barbara has made sure
that each toilet

2674
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,118
has a state of the art
vaginal cleanse.

2675
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:09,872
You know
exactly what I'm saying.

2676
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,598
Every single model
comes with Justine.

2677
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,800
Talk about a smart toilet.

2678
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,176
She knows
if you need a little sploosh

2679
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,200
or if you actually need

2680
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,800
the fountains
of the Bellagio up there.

2681
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,034
Scotty has finally
got his seat at the table.

2682
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,715
It's beautiful.

2683
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,678
He went a little too far
with the dragons,

2684
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,240
and the titties,
and the motorboating.

2685
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,800
Oy vey.

2686
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:30,629
Oh, Miss Stephanie.

2687
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,309
She had the idea to link
the Fleming-Mayhew company

2688
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,277
with the new foundation.

2689
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,630
So now, they're sponsoring
sewage projects

2690
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,916
all over the Third World.
I told you.

2691
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,434
Smart, smart, smart girl.

2692
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,833
So, things are working out
really well for the gang here.

2693
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,719
The company is
a smashing success.

2694
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,878
And my dear Laird

2695
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,475
has finally gotten
what he's always wanted.

2696
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,194
To be part of a family.

2697
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,358
All right, ciao for now,
you friends.

2698
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,589
Until we meet again.

2699
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:02,776
Laird, it doesn't count as
a sneak attack if I can see...

2700
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,552
Fuck you, Goose!
Scheisse!

2701
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:11,831
I wanna rock and roll
all night

2702
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,910
And party every day

2703
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:18,636
I wanna rock and roll
all night

2704
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,597
And party every day

2705
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,759
You keep on saying
you'll be mine for a while

2706
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,397
You're looking fancy
and I like your style

2707
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:36,198
You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

2708
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,999
You show us
everything you've got

2709
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,994
Baby, baby, it's quite a lot

2710
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:50,191
You drive us wild,
we 'll drive you crazy

2711
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:55,637
You keep on shouting,
you keep on shouting

2712
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:03,231
I wanna rock and roll
