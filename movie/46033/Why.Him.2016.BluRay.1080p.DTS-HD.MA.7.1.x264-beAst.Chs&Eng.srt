Hey, gang, say hi to the Flemings.

414
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,450
- 你们好  - 你们好吗？
- Hey, guys.  - Hey, what's up?

415
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,410
等等 你的员工住在这里？
Wait, I don't understand. Do your employees live here?

416
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,370
有些人可能是 我也搞不清楚
Uh, maybe some of them do. I don't really know.

417
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,580
古斯塔其实是很神的建筑师
Gustav is actually an amazing architect.

418
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,290
这里是我们一起设计的
We designed this place together.

419
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,420
你什么时候去了马丘比丘？
When did you go to Machu Picchu?

420
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,510
这是什么时候放的？
Hun, when did you put these up?

421
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,380
那头麋鹿是怎么回事？
What the heck is that moose?

422
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,720
那是菲利普曼费迪的作品
That's a Phillip Manfredi.

423
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,090
好眼光 芭芭拉
Great pick-up, Barb.

424
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,310
听说你是很厉害的艺术和摄影教授
Stephy told me that you're this amazing art and photography professor.

425
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,060
- 有够犀利  - 嗯嗯
- That's awesome.  - Mmm-hmm.

426
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,480
我只是在社区大学教两堂课
I teach a couple of classes at a local community college.

427
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,150
别谦虚 妈 你是很棒的摄影师
Don't be so modest, Mom. You're an amazing photographer.

428
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,320
它看起来就像真的死麋鹿
Oh, that looks like a real dead moose.

429
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,820
被你说中了 奈德
Well, that's exactly what it is, Ned.

430
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,700
泡在自己尿里的死麋鹿
A dead moose suspended in its own urine.

431
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,870
象征了文化是如何禁锢我们的心灵
It's meant to symbolize the way that our culture has imprisoned our minds.

432
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,000
我得说 好艺术让我欲火焚身
I got to tell you, Ned, great art really gets me aroused.

433
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,750
简直就像强力春药
It's actually a very strong aphrodisiac.

434
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,800
莱德
Laird.

435
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,420
倒不是说那位美魔女还不够诱人
Not that you need any help getting turned on by that gorgeous woman.

436
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,670
宝贝
Honey.

437
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,550
干嘛？你妈妈很美啊
What? Your mom is beautiful.

438
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,510
- 她是啊  - 她值得被称赞
- She is.  - She deserves some props for that.

439
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,680
有人敢夸我就敢听
Well, I'll take a compliment wherever I can get one.

440
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,100
那我继续说 你的身材很火辣
Well, here's another one. You got a bangin' bod, too.

441
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,140
好的
All right.

442
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,600
大家好啊
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

443
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,350
这位是理查·布莱斯
Richard Blais, everybody.

444
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,030
他是分子厨艺大师
This is the maestro of molecular gastronomy.

445
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,030
老天 是“顶级主厨”里那个帅哥
Oh, my God. That's that cute one from Top Chef.

446
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,820
他是老爱说“砰”的那个
Oh, he's the one who goes, "Bam!"

447
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,280
那是艾莫利 那家伙是个烂咖
No, that's Emeril. He's a fucking dick, that guy.

448
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,700
阿布 什么事？
Dickie Blais what's up?

449
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,460
莱德觉得今晚为你们做个快闪餐厅
Yeah, so Laird thought it would be a fun idea to do a pop-up restaurant

450
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,670
会很好玩
just in your honor tonight.

451
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,330
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Did he?  - Yeah.

452
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,210
我做了醒嘴的小点
And I have here a little amuse-bouche.

453
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,170
如果有人想吃晚餐前的小点心
So if anyone's looking for a little pre-dinner snack,

454
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,420
可以过来这里
you can head on up here.

455
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,300
太好了 因为我饿扁了
Count me in, 'cause I'm famished.

456
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,220
好耶
All right.

457
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,010
你的惊喜还真多
There are so many surprises.

458
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,600
我知道
I know.

459
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,890
饿肚子的人来对地方了
You're hungry, you've come to the right place.

460
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,560
我为你们准备了海陆飨宴
I've got surf and turf for you.

461
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,810
牛排和龙虾
Steak and lobster.

462
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,100
太好了
Yum, yum.

463
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,150
我的版本有食用土和浮游生物泡沫
My version of surf and turf, edible soil and plankton foam.

464
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,230
请用
Dig in. Oh.

465
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,240
我等不及要吃晚餐了
Wow, can't wait for dinner.

466
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
免了
No.

467
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,700
我觉得进行得很顺利耶
Hey, so I think it's going great, right?

468
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,740
我看他们已经接受我了
I think they've already accepted me.

469
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,330
我接收到的讯号不太一样
I'm getting a little bit of a different vibe.

470
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,950
真假？怎么说？
Oh, really? Like what?

471
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,410
别太刻意
Don't try so hard.

472
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,870
我哪有 你是什么意思？
I'm not, what do you mean?

473
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
你为我爸装了保龄球道
You put in a bowling alley for my dad

474
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,000
还把我全家人刺在你背上
and you got a tattoo of my entire family on your back.

475
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,460
刺青太过火了吗？
Was the tattoo too much?

476
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,760
- 对  - 妈的
- Yes.  - Fuck.

477
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,470
靠 我就知道
Shit, I knew it.

478
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,100
古斯塔也说过一样的话
Yeah, Gustav said the same thing.

479
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,350
好 别担心
Okay, don't worry...

480
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,430
我暂时不会再刺有他们的刺青了
I won't get any more tattoos of them while they're here.

481
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,680
- 谢谢你  - 没问题
- Thank you.  - Okay.

482
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,890
我爱你
I love you.

483
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,310
我也爱你
I love you, too.

484
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
好吧
Okay.

485
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,320
还有 别再对他们烙脏话
Oh, one more thing, stop calling them motherfuckers

486
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,160
或说我妈有多辣了
and talking about how hot my mom is.

487
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,030
她出乎意料的性感 我惊呆了
Well, she's sneaky sexy, took me by surprise.

488
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,120
她是个辣妈 正港的辣妈
Dude, she is a MILF, like a genuine MILF.

489
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,420
如果她不是你妈 就是个“搞妈”
And if it wasn't your MILF, she'd be a MIWF...

490
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,130
我想搞的妈
a mother I would fuck.

491
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,040
- 但是我不会  - 好
- But I won't.  - Okay.

492
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,920
- 废话  - 谢谢你
- Of course.  - Thank you.

493
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,680
- 好啦 这里很美  - 是啊
- All right, it's pretty.  - Yeah.

494
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,850
我…
You know...

495
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
是很夸张
It's a lot.

496
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,520
- 对 那麋鹿…  - 对
- Yes! I mean, the moose...  - Yes.

497
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,360
那些粗话 拜托哦
And the language. Come on!

498
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,110
真正的麋鹿耶
Mmm-hmm. A real moose!

499
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,150
- 他还调戏你妈  - 很糟糕
- And he's coming onto your mother.  - That's not okay.

500
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,610
还有刺青？
And the tattoo?

501
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,990
那刺青…他多大…？
The tattoo! And how...

502
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,780
- 三十二岁  - 我的天 你才…
- 32  - Oh, my. And you're...

503
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,120
- 二十二岁  - 没错
- 22.  - Yes!

504
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,490
你不喜欢保龄球道上的壁画？
You didn't like the mural of you and Scotty down in the new bowling alley?

505
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,460
保龄球道跟壁画…那是标准球道
The bowling alley with the mural is... And the bowling alley is regulation.

506
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,130
是蛮不错的
That's quite nice

507
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,210
很少有人有那么好的东西
and that's very rare to have something that nice.

508
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,760
他用的抛光蜡也很好 但是…
And the polish that he used was quite... It was good. But...

509
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,970
对不起
I'm sorry.

510
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,510
我早该告诉你的
I should have told you.

511
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,970
对你坦白一切
About everything, of course.

512
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,600
我不知道该怎么在电话里介绍他
Honestly, I didn't know how to explain him over the phone.

513
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,480
我一直想像…
I just kept imagining...

514
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,190
妈会上网搜寻莱德
Mom Googling Laird Mayhew

515
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,070
你们会在认识他之前就先下断论
and you guys jumping to conclusions before you even got a chance to know him.

516
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,610
现在我们认识他了
Well, now we know him.

517
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,450
还没有 你们才到十五分钟
No, you don't. You've been here for 15 minutes.

518
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
是啊
Yeah.

519
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

520
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,130
这是你们第一次没在家过圣诞节
I wouldn't have asked you to come out here and miss Christmas in Michigan

521
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,590
我会特地邀你们来都是因为…
for the first time ever, if he wasn't...

522
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,050
他对我真的很重要
...really important to me.

523
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,350
好吧
Okay.

524
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,190
你会给他一个机会？
You'll give him a chance?

525
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,690
- 好  - 谢谢你…
- Okay.  - Okay, thank you. Thank you.

526

00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,070
我也爱你
I love you, too.

529
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,410
如果我上网搜寻他 会看到什么？
So if I did Google him, what would I find?

530
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,460
别这么做
Don't do it.

531
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,750
不要搜寻他
Don't search for him.

532
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,340
我还是看不懂
Well, I still don't see it.

533
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,380
这个是男的 他在“挺进”
Darling, this is the male, and he's thrusting.

534
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,430
我的天
Oh, God.

535
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,350
各位 晚餐上桌了
All right, everybody, dinner is served!

536
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,560

537
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,890
爸 你坐那里吧 妈
Dad, you wanna go there? Mom.

538
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,520
你确定你不要脱掉外套？
You sure you don't want to take off your coat?

539
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,690
不用 我很好
No. I'm good.

540
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,020
这里走家庭风 大家就开动吧
We do it family style here, so everyone just dig in.

541
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,520
随意就好
It's super cas.

542
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,900

Because that bear fucked that dude up! Now we're gonna fuck this bear up.

558
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,270

Hey, what about that language?

559
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440

The way her spine gently arches to meet the top of her tailbone.

Oh, I didn't go to Stanford, bro. I hardly even graduated from high school.

Steph, over the phone, you said you've only known each other for a couple of months.

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,940
- 一开始还没认真嘛  - 才不
- It was super casual at first.  - No.

629
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,140

635
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,610
奈德 你别误会
Ned. Don't get the wrong idea.

636
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,620
那不是性 绝对不只是那样
It was not sexual at all. It was so much more than that.

637
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,950
抱歉 这下我听不懂了

639
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,830
史考特 闭嘴

Look. Yeah, we did.

642
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,590
但我想说的是那改造了我
But what I'm saying is I was transformed.

643

史黛芬就像花苞般绽放开来
Stephy opened up like a flower.

662
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,340
那里一点都不低俗

他们还提供瑜伽课等等的

毛巾在哪里啊？
Where the heck are the towels?

他还带坏了史考特

她最好解释这是怎么回事

史黛芬累坏了

我欠你们一个道歉
I owe you two an apology.

692
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
我一紧张起来
When I get nervous

693
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,060
就会一直讲各种垃圾话
all kinds of crap comes flying out of my mouth

694

I don't know if you know this, but I never knew my father.

Yeah, he picked up my mom in this bar in Oakland.

They had some sloppy car sex, and then never spoke again.

好的
Yeah.

709
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,260
我跟我妈也不亲
I'm not really close with my mom, either.

710
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,640

To be frank, she's kind of a motherfucking bitch.

711

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,150
关掉…
Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!

822
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,320
天啊
God!

823
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,780
惨了
Oh, scheisse!

824
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,110
我们遇到一些技术问题
We are having some technical difficulties.

825
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,820
那是阴部清洗功能
That was the vaginal cleanse.

826
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,950
什么清洗？
The what cleanse?

827
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,780
我只想要一张卫生纸
I just want a square of toilet paper.

828
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,120
阴部清洗
The vaginal cleanse.

829
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,660
我听说会很清爽 显然也很刺激
Which I hear is refreshing and apparently also very stimulating.

830
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,460
我听说的
Just saying.

831
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,010
奈德？
Ned?

832
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,090
你来真的？
Really?

833
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,470
对不起 奈德
I'm so sorry, Ned...

834
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,850
但我必须从里面手动重开机
but I'm going to have to manually reboot the system from the inside.

835
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,310
从这里？
In here?

836
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,770
真对不起
I am so sorry.

837
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,980
好吧
Fine.

838
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,980
有何不可？
Why not?

839
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,820
老婆 可以关上门吗？抱歉
Barb, would you close the door? Sorry.

840
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,440
这会很棒的
It's gonna be great.

841
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,820
奈德 我是专业人士
Ned, I am blinders.

842
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,530
我什么都没看到 闻到
I see nothing. I smell nothing.

843
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,500
- 这图案太小了  - 没错
- The print is very small.  - Mm-hmm.

844
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,870
不好意思
Okay, forgive me.

845
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
我看不到说明
I can't see the instructions.

846
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,050
好了 让我看看
All right. What do we have here?

847
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,080
我昨晚有点肠胃问题
I had some stomach problems last night.

848
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,080
我想是熊肉害的
I think it was the bear.

849
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,500
我保证是熊肉害的
I can guarantee you, it was the bear.

850
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,550
抽风机启动中
Turning on the fan.

851
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,760
太好了 真给力
Great. Wunderbar.

852
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,560
怎么样？
How'd it go?

853
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,440
很抱歉花了这么久的时间
I am so sorry that it took so long.

854
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,940
奈德 我需要你定住不动
Ned, I'm going to need you to be completely still

855
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,400
我们要锁定你的位置
while we try to lock in your location.

856
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,860
我坐在马桶上 够“定”了吧
I'm sitting on a toilet, that's pretty still.

857
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,400
搜寻中…
Searching, searching, und searching.

858
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,910
我们锁定目标了
And we have target achieved!

859
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,580
让水喷吧
And sploosh!

860
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,590
吃吧 女孩们
There you go, girls.

861
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,090

完全放养
All free-range.

Pigs, artisanal llamas.

865
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,600
这里的食物都来自方圆五百码内
Everything you eat here comes from within a 500-yard radius.

866
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,150
我称之为“草地直送饮食法”
I call it "lawn to table eating."

867
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,310
它来了
There she is.

868
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,980
黛西
Hey, Daisy.

869
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
嗨
Oh. Hi.

870
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,110

Go on, get.

871
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,910
真高兴能跟你出来走走
So glad we're doing this, Ned.

872
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,950
我常听史黛芬说你的事情
I feel like I know you after everything that Steph's told me about you,

873
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,660
但见到本人还是不同…
but still not the same...

874
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,580
- 你要屈服吗？ - 去你的
- Do you submit?  - Fuck you!

875
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,290
- 古斯塔  - 奈德 让开
- Gustav!  - Ned, stay away!

876
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,420
你想打？
You wanna fight?

877
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,800
- 投降吧  - 不要
- Tap out!  - No!

878
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,090
你想投降的
You want to tap out.

879
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,850
好啦…
Okay, okay! Fine!

880
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,520
很好
Nice work!

881
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,020
你的反应越来越快了
And your reactions are getting quicker.

882
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,270
- 真的吗？ - 对
- Really?  - Absolutely.

883
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,020
谢了
Thanks.

884
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,100
抱歉 奈德 我不想让你受伤
I am so sorry, Ned. I just didn't want you to get hurt.

885
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,980
等等 这是《粉红豹》那套？
Wait, so you just do this Pink Panther thing?

886
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,530
- 粉红豹？ - 粉红豹？
- Pink Panther?  - Pink Panther?

887
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,990
《粉红豹》电影里的粉红豹啊
The Pink Panther from the Pink Panther movies.

888
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,330
卡图会攻击探长 让他保持警觉
When Cato attacks Inspector Clouseau to keep him sharp.

889
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,990
是很老的片吗？我没听过
Are those really old? I never heard of it.

890
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,870
我也不太清楚 但听起来很有趣
I'm not familiar, either, but it sounds absolutely charming.

891
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,000
《粉红豹》啊
Pink Panther.

892
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,540
电影？
The movies? Mm-hmm.

893
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,710
卡图是他的助手兼男仆
Cato is his assistant, his houseboy.

894
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,220
- 男仆？ - 这…
- Houseboy?  - Well, it's...

895
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,340
有种族歧视的味道
That sounds racist.

896
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,680
他是会叫他“黄种朋友” 不过…
He did call him "my little yellow friend." But...

897
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,720
莱德是大型科技公司的执行长
I'm sorry, you have to understand, Ned. Laird is the CEO of a massive tech company.

898
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,520
我不喜欢被保镖跟着跑
I don't like bodyguards around

899
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,520
我就请老古训练我 以防我被绑架
so I have Goose train me in case I get kidnapped or whatever.

900
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,360
对了 你的春谷道动作很扎实
By the way, your Chun Kuk Do moves were very solid.

901
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,190
但闪避性跑酷呢？
But what happened to the evasive parkour?

902
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,530
- 闪避性跑酷  - 是的
- Ah, evasive parkour.  - Yeah.

903
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,070
我他妈恍神了
I totally fucking spaced!

904
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,860
永远都有进步空间
There's always room to improve.

905
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,070
- 很好  - 谢了 老兄
- All right.  - Thanks, man.

906
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,530
你行的 兄弟
You got it, brother.

907
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,370
我先告退了 朋友

908
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,000
你们好好聊天吧
And you guys have a lovely chat.

909
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,580
奈德 来吧 去看看我的办公室
Ned, come on. I wanna show you my office.

910
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,420
那根本就是“粉红豹”
You know, that's like classic Pink Panther.

911
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,420
- 这是你工作的地方？ - 对
- This is where you work, huh?  - Yeah.

I have a den in the house where I do the financial stuff

913
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,930
但好点子都是在这诞生的
but this is where all the big ideas happen.

914
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,020
你难道不需要电脑跟…
Don't you need a computer and...

915
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,230
不用 贾丝汀都会记录下来
Nah. My girl Justine records everything.

916
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,520
对吧？
Right, J?

917
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,440
没错 嗨 奈德
Yep, I'm here. Hey, Ned.

918
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,610
你放一下昨天的录音吧
Hey, why don't you play back a blip from yesterday's session?

919
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,230
马上来 靠 你的云端有好多垃圾
All right, hold on. Fuck. There's so much shit up here in your Cloud.

920
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,570

狒狒颜射
Baboon Bukkake.

925
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,710
妈的 烂透了
Fuck! Wow, that's awful!

926
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,750
烂主意
Bad idea.

927
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,080
为什么？
Why? Why's that? Uh...

928
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,630
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

929
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,590
颜射吗？
Bukkake?

930
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,130
就是状况此起彼落 让你应接不暇
Just means a lot of things are happening and you're feeling overwhelmed.

931
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,590

934
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,270
直接躺地上是吧
Just pop down right here on the floor.

935
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,900
这就对了
There you go.

936
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,110
奈德 你跟我有很多共通点
Ned, I think you and I have so much in common.

937
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,580
我们看到想要的东西 就全力以赴
We see something we want and we just dive in

938
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,620
然后拿下它
and we take it.

939
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,790
你懂吗？
Know what I mean?

940
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,080
懂…
Yeah.

941
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,830
所以呢…
Which is why...

942
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,090
圣诞节当天…
...on Christmas Day...

943
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,760
我要向史黛芬求婚
I'm going to ask Stephy to marry me.

944
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,980
我知道你们的感情有多紧密
And I know how tight you two are.

945
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,980
对
Mm-hmm.

946
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,770
所以我真的很想…
So I'd really, really

947
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,980
得到你的祝福
like your blessing.

948
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,450
莱德
Uh, Laird.

949
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,620
- 谢谢你找我谈  - 当然
- Really appreciate you coming to me.  - 'Course.

950
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,030
但答案是不行
But, uh, the answer's no.

951
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,170
老兄 我好困惑
Dude, I'm so confused.

952
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,380
搞屁啊？什么鬼？
What the fuck? What the hell?

953
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,380
我跟古斯塔排练时完全不是这样
This went so much differently when I rehearsed it with Gustav.

954
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,130
我问你 然后你说“好 儿子”
Yeah. I asked you and you were like, "Yeah, dude. My son."

955
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,180
莱德 听我说
Laird. Listen to me, okay.

956
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,510
先不说我根本不知道你的来历
Beside the fact that I don't know you from a hole in the wall...

957
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,520
史黛芬还没准备要迈入这个阶段
Stephanie is just not ready for this step in her life.

958
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,650
我倒觉得她一直在暗示我
Oh, I'm totally getting the signals that she is.

959
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,480
我是她爸 我还蛮了解她的

- 别喊我爸  - 别喊你爸？
- Don't call me "Dad."  - Don't call you "Dad"?

973

我不是你爸
I'm not your dad.

974

你将来会是我岳父
I mean, you're gonna be my dad.

什么 老爸？
What, Dad?

977
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,440
现在你只是在胡闹
Okay, now you're playing with me.

完录…什么是“完录”？
Totes. And totes is what?

987
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,800
就是“完全有录到” 但用简称省事
It means totally. But totally's kind of long, so "totes" is just easier.

988
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,720

to spend his entire childhood inside, learning computers.

1231
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,300
那有点可悲吧？
I think that's kind of sad, right?

1232
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,350
被他吞了
He ate it. Hmm.

1233
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,190
他是章鱼
He's an octopus.

1234
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,030
他像章鱼伸出触角纠缠我们全家
That kid is wrapping his tentacles around every member of this family.

1235
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,530
他在玩弄你
He's manipulating you.

1236
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,030
老公 我们该退一步想想
Darling, we need to bring this down a notch.

1237
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,330
你觉得你在跟莱德斗争
Okay? You think you're at war with Laird.

1238
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,200
但他没有在作战 只有你
But he's not fighting. It's just you.

1239
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,080
我们去认识他那些可爱的朋友吧
Come on, let's go meet his friends. They look darling.

1240
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,870
我的天
Oh, God.

1241
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,000
JDK建置接精简型APP整个GG
Totally tanked porting the thin-client apps for the JDK build.

1242
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,420
瞎毁？所以要重写编码？
The fuck? So you had to rewrite all the code?

1243
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,590
对 我亲自出马
Mm-hmm. By myself.

1244
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,930
- 那你有写好吗？ - 当然
- But did you do it?  - Oh, you know I did!

1245
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,510
- 他们来了  - 嗨
- Hey, there they are!  - Hi.

1246
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
美得冒泡
Looking like a babe.

1247
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,890
这个小帅哥是谁
Look who's looking sharp.

1248
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,350
- 正点  - 你们好
- Okay!  - Hello!

1249
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,350
泰森 他们是史黛芬的爸妈 弗莱明夫妇
Tyson, these are Stephanie's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Fleming.

1250
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,890
叫我们芭芭拉和奈德就好
Oh, no. Barb and Ned, please.

1251
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,770
他妈的有够瞎
So it was fucked up, man.

1252
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,400
我花了两周弄J2EE资料库
It took me two weeks on the J2EE database...

1253
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,570
想让介面随着伺服器反应
trying to get the interface to react with the server...

1254
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,740
我才能让容器再次运作
so I can get the containers up and running again.

1255
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,240
抱歉 泰森 什么是J2EE？
I'm sorry. Tyson, what's a J2EE?

1256
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,290
Java2平台企业版
Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition.

1257
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,740
- 你不写程式的？ - 抱歉
- Do you not write code?  - Sorry.

1258
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,370
- 这家伙超讨厌  - 是啊
- This guy's the worst.  - Yeah.

1259
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,580
我比较擅长人际关系
I'm actually more of a personal relations kind of guy.

1260
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,290
像是专案管理 客户服务之类
Like account management, client services. That kind of stuff.

1261
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,090
老兄 这小子超屌的
Dude, this kid is fucking awesome.

1262
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,720
奈德在培育史考特接手家族企业
Yes, Ned is grooming Scotty to take over our family business.

1263
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,590
- 没错  - 我们在密西根做印刷
- That's right.  - We own a printing business in Michigan.

1264
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,260
真假？既然你们是做印刷的
Really? I'm sure you're familiar with those two siblings over there

1265
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,100
应该很熟那对兄妹
since you're in the printing business.

1266
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,600
那边的兄妹档 来见见这家伙
Yo, brother-sister act! You gotta meet this guy.

1267
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,600
你们好
Hello!

1268
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,480
我们是布廉和蜜西裴德曼
Hey! Blaine and Missy Pederman.

1269
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,770
我是芭芭拉·弗莱明
Hi, I'm Barb Fleming.

1270
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,270

- This is my husband.  - Ned.

1271
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,900
我是史考特·弗莱明 你们好
I'm Scott Fleming. Nice to meet you.

1272
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,110
两位应该很有名 但恐怕我们…
I'm sorry, we were told we might know you, but I'm afraid we don't.

1273
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,780
布廉和蜜西创办了无邮无虑
Blaine and Missy started Stamp Free Invites.

1274
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,450
好的
Oh, okay.

1275
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,790
很好
Right.

1276
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:00,950
怎么了？
What's up?

1277
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,330
系统忘了提醒你有庆生派对吗？
Did the server forget to send a reminder for your birthday party or something?

1278
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,460
不 他做的是真的印刷业
No, he is actually in the printing business.

1279
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,920
- 靠  - 糟糕
- Oh, shit.  - Whoops.

1280
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:10,670
没关系
No, no.

1281
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,130
我们没害你关门大吉吧？
We didn't put you out of business or anything?

1282
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,010
没有
No.

1283
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,640
- 关门大吉？ - 没有…
- What? Ruin our business?  - No, no.

1284
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,600
我们生意很好 感谢关心
We're doing quite well. Thank you.

1285
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,010
- 太好了  - 很好 我是说真的
- Oh, that's great!  - Good for you! Honestly, good for you.

1286
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,930
我们很爱这种街坊影印店
We love little mom-and-pop printers.

1287
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,020
- 超励志又重要  - 没错
- So inspirational. So important.  - Mm-hmm.

1288
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,650
我爸的公司比较像工厂
My dad has more of a factory.

1289
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,020
不是要吹牛 但规模蛮大的
Not to brag, but we're a pretty big shop.

1290
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,810
人们需要纸 能在上面写字的东西
People need paper. They need something to write on.

1291
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,650
他们喜欢拿着卡片纸的手感
They love the feel of that card stock in their hands.

1292
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,650
是啊
Yeah.

1293
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,650
我从来没听过这种话
I've never heard anyone say that.

1294
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,660
- 我们不知道有这种事  - 真的
- Hmm. We have not found that at all.  - Yeah. Nope.

1295
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,280
我们应该来自不同星球
I think we come from two different worlds.

1296
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,490
是的
Yes, we do.

1297
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,660
你最好立马开始学编码
You better start learning code pretty fucking fast, dude.

1298
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,120
奈德出运时
Dude, Ned was crushing it

1299
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,830
你们俩还在抢母奶喝咧
since before you two were fighting over your mother's titties.

1300
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,710
我妈没喂我们母乳
Our mom didn't breastfeed us.

1301
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,550
你明知道我们有奶妈
Laird, you know we had a wet nurse.

1302
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,710
看得出来
Oh, I can tell.

1303
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,170
我还真听不懂你们的对话
Boy, I'll tell you, I don't know what's going on.

1304
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,180
听拢呒
I'm lost.

1305
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,640
- 我应接不暇  - 我也是
- I'm overwhelmed. Yeah!  - Me, too.

1306
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,680
我完全被颜射了
There's bukkake floating all around me.

1307
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,890
- 什么？ - 蛤？
- What?  - Hm?

1308
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,180
什么是颜射？
What's bukkake?

1309
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,390
莱德教我的
Oh, Laird told me.

1310
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,350
就是应接不暇那些此起彼落的
It means when you're overwhelmed and you got too much going on.

1311
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,230
- 这样啊  - 完全状况外
- Oh, my gosh.  - Can't figure things out.

1312
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,690
那我简直是被颜射淹没了
Then, I'm drowning in bukkake at this point.

1313
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,030
说真的 那是射精在脸上的意思
Okay, I'm gonna be real with you guys. It means jizz on your face.

1314
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,530
你说啥？
I'm sorry?

1315
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,070
颜射是指被射在脸上
Bukkake means covered in jizz.

1316
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,410
一大堆精液在脸上
Tons of jizz, ejaculate.

1317
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,990
通常是在多P以后
Usually after a gangbang.

1318
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,370
没有听起来那么糟啦
Not as bad as it sounds.

1319
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,740
对 多P的最后
Yeah, post-gangbang.

1320
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,660
或中间 如果有人提早缴械
Or during. Depends if someone finishes early.

1321
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,080
- 搞什么？ - 我是想保护你
- What the heck?  - I was trying to protect you, dude.

1322
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,880
- 保护我？ - 可恶的贾丝汀
- Protect me?  - Fucking Justine.

1323
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,170
你是想整我吧？
You mean embarrass me?

1324
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,550
那是很感性的谈话时间
It was a really sensitive conversation.

1325
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,710
我不想聊一群男人打枪的事
I didn't want to start talking about guys jerking off on each other.

1326
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,220
干嘛说是应接不暇？
Why'd you tell me it was overwhelming?

1327
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,550
是贾丝汀害的
Justine brought it up!

1328
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,220
这个时候来看示范影片就对了
I hope this is an opportune time to show a video.

1329
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,260
不行
It's not.

1330
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,720
- 天啊  - 没错
- Oh, God!  - Yeah.

1331
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,560
这是教育的时刻
Oh, and this is a teaching moment.

1332
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,060
- 还有这个  - 我的天
- Here's another.  - Oh, my God.

1333
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,230
- 不 史考特  - 你别看
- No. Scotty.  - Don't look at that.

1334
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,190
你真的不用看这个
It's all good. You don't have to see this.

1335
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,900
那是你本人吗？
Is that you?

1336
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,440
不是
No.

1337
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,860

Hi, Pops.

1358
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,360
- 我需要透透气  - 我陪你去
- I just need some fresh air.  - Can I come?

1359
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,780
我们俩总是有话直说吧？
We've always been straight with each other, haven't we?

1360
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,950
当然了
Yeah, of course.

1361
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,500
我必须认真地问你一个问题
Okay, I need to ask you a question. And I mean this honestly.

1362
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,870
好 什么？
Okay. What?

00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,380
什么？
What?

1365
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,670
为何挑莱德？
Why Laird?

1366
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,170
- 说真的  - 天啊

1368
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,130
我们把你生得聪明又漂亮
You are so smart and you're beautiful.

1369
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,510
你谁不拍拖 偏偏选莱德？
You could be dating anyone. Why?

1370
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,970
- 我不懂  - 你要真相？
- I don't get it.  - You want the truth?

1371
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,310
对
Yes.

1372
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,680
他让我想到你
He kind of reminds me of you.

1373
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,190

1375
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,480
好 拜托你解释一下
Okay, I need you to explain that one.

1376
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,480
怎么会？
How?

1377
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,190
你们都是我所认识最真诚的人
You're both the most honest and authentic men that I know.

1378
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,740
- 只是表现方式不同  - 这…
- It comes out in totally different ways.  - Oh, well...

1379
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,360
莱德口无遮拦
Laird has literally no filter.

1380
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,080
我都没发现 真的吗？
I don't know that to be true. Is that right?

1381
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,740
- 好吧  - 抱歉
- Okay.  - Sorry.

1382

他是很好的人
He's a very good guy.

1385

你爱他？
You love him?

1387
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,020

- Okay? I'll try.  - Try to what?

1394
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,410
我会试着…
I'll try to just...

1395
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,080
多了解那个人
...understand that person better.

1396

1403
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,450
要我把它脱掉吗？
Want me to take it off?

1404
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,160
麻烦你 我只带了两件衬衫
Would you, please? I only brought two dress shirts.

1405
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,120
我真的很不想在旅行时烫衣服
I really don't feel like ironing while I'm on this trip.

1406
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,580
累死我了
I'm so exhausted.

1407
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,670

你撞到头了吗？
Did you hit your head or something?

1412
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,140
好耶 让我闻闻那鞋子

1413
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,260
- 你不会想闻它的  - 我要闻
- You don't wanna smell my shoe.  - Yeah, I want feet!

1414
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,470
我要袜子离开那双脚
I want those feet out of those socks.

1415
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,930
老婆 你是怎么了？
Barb, what happened to you?

1416
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,980
我现在正嗨呢

什么？你在哪里抽的？
Barb. What? Where did you?

1421
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,450
你们离开以后 我好孤单
I was very lonely after you guys left.

1422
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,950
我看到一个家伙拿着烟
And I saw this guy, and he had a cigarette.

1423
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,540
我以为是那种电动的烟
I thought it was one of those electronic cigarettes.

1424
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,870
- 那叫电子烟  - 对啦
- They're called E-cigs.  - Yeah.

1425
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,830
没想到…
But turns out...

1426
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,840

什么啦？
What is that?

1430
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,800
从那机器里面跑出来的是大麻
It's marijuana that comes out of some kind of machine.

1431
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,680
- 你小声一点  - 那是合法的
- Keep your voice down!  - Ned, it's legal.

1432
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,680
那个小可怜有睡眠呼吸中止症
Oh, this poor boy had it for sleep apnea.

- I just want to see him.  - Don't call him that.

1443
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,740
拜托啦
Please. Come on.

1444
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:57,580
天啊 你以前很爱嗨后乱性的
Oh, my God! You used to love getting high and fooling around.

1445
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,160
什么？不要…
What? Barb! No, Barb.

1446
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,920

01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,090
你知道了？
You knew?

1637
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:12,420
老公 我们觉得你可能会抓狂
Honestly, honey, we thought you might freak out.

1638
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:16,800
就决定等到过完圣诞节再说
So we decided to wait until after Christmas to bring it up.

1639
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,970
不过他有说基金会的事吧？
But, okay, he told you about the foundation, right?

1640
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,890
- 有  - 很好
- Yes.  - Yes, okay.

1641
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,480
这是我想要你们来见莱德的主因
This is a big part of why I wanted you to come out here and meet Laird.

1642
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,980
女儿 就算他不是个可怜的疯子
Stephanie, even if he wasn't this abject lunatic,

1643
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,280
而且他就是
which he is,

1644
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,320
我还是不懂为什么
I still wouldn't understand why.

1645
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:36,240
你只剩两学期就毕业了
You've only got a few semesters left before you graduate.

1646
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,120
你为什么要放弃那一切？
Why would you just throw that away?

1647
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,450
我没有放弃任何东西
I'm not throwing anything away, Dad.

1648
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:42,120
我在中美洲当义工的这一年…
The year I spent in Central America doing this kind of work,

1649
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,460
我知道你觉得我决定得太仓促
I know you think that I'm making some rash decision

1650
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:47,630
我没有
and I'm not.

1651
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,130
我们讨论了好几个月
We've spent months figuring it out.

1652
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,760
你隐瞒你有男友的这几个月
All the months where you didn't even tell us you had a boyfriend.

1653
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,930
是这样吗？
All those months?

1654
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,800
老公…
Darling...

1655
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,470
我觉得你该听她说完
I think you should hear her out

1656
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,970
因为听起来还蛮有意思的
because it actually sounds very interesting.

1657
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:01,970
是吗？
Does it?

1658
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,140
你愿意听我说吗？
Are you willing to listen to me?

1659
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,310
请你说清楚
Give it your best shot.

1660
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,810
我们打算专注在妇女健康上
The plan is to focus on women's health

1661
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,650
进而改善第三世界的环境…
as a function of environmental change in the Third World.

1662
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,690
- 好  - 好吧
- Right.  - All right.

1663
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:14,110
当那一切失败 你会剩下什么？
And when all that goes belly-up, you know what you're left with?

1664
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,320
- 什么？ - 大学肄业
- What?  - Being a college dropout.

1665
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,990
- 就这样  - 你不懂
- That's it.  - You don't get it.

1666
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,160
我不懂？
Oh, I don't get it?

1667
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,990
没错 你一点都不懂
No, you just, like, don't get it at all.

1668
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:22,830
那是什么？
Oh. What is that?

1669
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,120
[莱德]

1670
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,460
是刺青
It's a tattoo.

1671
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,000
他的名字？你有刺青？
With his name? You got a tattoo?

1672
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:29,130
你在身上留下印记 还是他的名字
You've marked your body with his name on it.

1673
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,380
你看看 老婆
Look at that, Barb!

1674
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,000
不…
Oh, no.

1675
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,880
真是太…窝心了
That is so cute.

1676
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,170
让我看 我想看
Let me see. I wanna see.

1677
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,220
莱德说我该做包脖刺青
Laird's been telling me I should get a neck tat.

1678
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,640
我知道莱德的诡计了
I see what Laird is doing here.

1679
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,640
我看透他了
I see what he's doing.

1680
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,180
他想挑拨我们全家
He is trying to put his imprint on this entire family.

1681
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:47,480
所以我们才会有这些秘密
And that is why we've got all these secrets now.

1682
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,020
都是因为他
And it's all because of him!

1683
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,060
你为什么就是不肯接受莱德？
Why do you have such a big problem with Laird?

1684
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,070
- 好问题 你知道吗？ - 什么？
- Great question. You know why?  - Why?

1685
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:55,190
因为他的影响
Because of his influence,

1686
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,700
你大学休学
you drop out of college.

1687
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,070
因为他的影响 你“刺身”了
Because of his influence, you get a "too."

1688
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,370
你是说“刺青”吧
Dad, I think you mean "tat."

1689
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,490
- 当然是刺青  - 不是“刺身”？
- You definitely mean "tat." I mean "tat?"  - It's not a "too?"

1690
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,660
- 是刺青 不是刺身  - 不是
- "Tat." No, it's not a "too."  - No.

1691
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,330
我在脱口秀看到的
No, I saw it on Geraldo.

1692
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,250
- 他们说是“刺身” - 好吧
- They call them "toos," okay?  - Okay.

1693
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:09,500
你会从此向下沉沦
This is what's going to be your downward spiral.

1694
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,250
你先是刺青
First you get a tattoo,

1695
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,040
接着就会开始呼麻
then you start vaporizing.

1696
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:14,840
- 什么？ - 你会呼麻
- What?  - You're vaporizing.

1697
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,550
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1698
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,680
就是…看似在抽电子烟
When you have... It's an e-cigarette.

1699
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,510
但里面不是烟草或假烟草
But instead of tobacco or a fake tobacco,

1700
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,390
里面装的其实是大麻
no, you have marijuana in that e-cigarette.

1701
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,770
- 爸 我知道那是什么  - 好
- Dad, I know what it is.  - Yeah.

1702
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:27,350
但你怎么会知道？
How do you know what it is?

1703
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,400
因为我阅历丰富 对吧？
Because I've been around. Haven't I?

1704
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,230
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

1705
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,110
然后你会开始用海洛因 没错
Then you go from there to heroin. Mm-hmm, that's right.

1706
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,700
你知道沉迷毒品会有什么后果吗？
After that, after you get hooked on drugs, you know what happens next?

1707
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,570
- 什么？ - 你会变成应召妹 妓女
- What?  - You'll become a hooker, a prostitute...

1708
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:42,950
站壁的
a pimp's bitch.

1709
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,780
你接下来就会变成那样
That's what's going to happen to you.

1710
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,240
我清楚得很
I see it very clearly.

1711
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,910
天啊…我还有多少时间？
Oh, my... How long do I have?

1712
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,960
很高兴你问了 没多久
I'm glad you asked. Not long.

1713
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,250
你再执迷不悟 很快就发生了
You keep going down this path, at this rate, not long.

1714
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,920
你现在显然没办法听我说
You're clearly not in a place to listen to me right now.

1715
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,090
所以我要走了
So I'm gonna go.

1716
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,590
真谢谢你的开示
Thank you, Pops, for the guidance.

1717
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,970
- 谢谢你  - 不用客气
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:42,550
史黛芬有坚挺的胸部吗？
Stephanie has perky breasts?

1764
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,420
- 什么？ - 好吧
- What?  - Okay.

1765
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,220
我会说有 因为她确实有
I would say yes, because she does.

1766
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,890
试试“史黛芬的双峰” 都小写

01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,390
莱德 闪避性跑酷…
Laird! Evasive parkour!

2044
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,640
莱德 快跑
Laird, get away!

2045
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:22,730
闪避性跑酷 快蹬墙
Evasive parkour! Do the wall pop!

2046
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,600
蹬墙
Wall pop!

2047
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:29,780
老古 你有看到吗？
Goose! Did you see that?

2048
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,650
蹬得好 你终于用核心肌群了
That's right! Because you finally engaged your core!

2049
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,820
给我下来
Get down here!

2050
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,240
感觉是不是很不一样？
You see the difference of the feeling? How it feels differently?

2051
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,780
我知道…
I know!

2052
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,870
- 天啊  - 老天
- Oh, my God!  - Oh, my God!

2053
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,750

- Don't breathe in. I'll save you, brother!  - Scotty, no! Scotty!

2054
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:43,870
不行 儿子
No, honey!

2055
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:45,920
我来救你了 莱德
I'm here to save you, Laird!

2056
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:51,420
儿子 小心
Scotty, watch out!

2057
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,890
莱德 你没事吧？
Laird! You okay?

2058
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,060
没事
Yeah!

2059
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:05,520
- 太好了  - 你没事
- Fantastic!  - You're okay.

2060
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,690
- 你没事  - 等等 史考特呢？
- You're okay.  - Wait. Where's Scotty?

2061
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,150
史考特 天啊
Scotty! Oh, my God.

2062
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,400
- 史考特  - 他在麋鹿底下
- Scotty!  - He's under the moose!

2063
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,860
他在麋鹿底下
He's under the moose!

2064
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,200
史考特
Scotty!

2065
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,280
靠北
Oh, shit.

2066
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,700
他妈的麋鹿蛋蛋在我嘴里
These fucking moose balls are in my mouth.

2067
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,910
靠 它在蛋洗你的脸耶
Oh, shit, he's teabagging you, bro!

2068
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,370
我帮你
I got you.

2069
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,210
快过来…
Come here. Come here.

2070
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,050
天啊 没事了
Oh, my God. It's okay.

2071
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:34,220
没事了
It's okay.

2072
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,010
女儿 很抱歉情况变成这样
Honey, I'm so sorry it turned out this way.

2073
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,180
我也是
Me, too.

2074
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:42,970
我到家再打给你
I'll call you when I get home.

2075
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,140
好好安慰史考特
Okay. Good luck with Scotty.

2076
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:47,400
- 谢谢你  - 是啊
- Thank you. I'll need it.  - Yeah.

2077
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:52,110
女儿 我从来没…
Steph, listen. I never...

2078
01:26:52,270 --> 01:26:54,490
我听够了 祝你旅途平安
I'm done listening. Have a safe flight.

2079
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,660
- 姐 再见  - 再见 史考特
- See you, sis.  - Bye, Scotty.

2080
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,990
我居然要回去用卫生纸了
Can't believe I have to go back to toilet paper.

2081
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:13,380
唐密里斯 圣诞快乐
Hey, Don Millis. Merry Christmas, sir.

2082
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,380
你也是 不好意思在圣诞节打来
You too, Ned. Look, I hate to call on Christmas.

2083
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,260
小事一桩
Oh, don't worry about that.

2084
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,180
昨天跟你叙旧很开心
It was great catching up yesterday

2085
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,550
我想尽快把决定告诉你
and I wanted to ring you as soon as we made a decision.

2086
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,390
好的
Okay.

2087
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,470
我跟大家讨论过你的提案
I talked with the group here about your proposal

2088
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,230
我们实在无法参与
and we just can't go for it.

2089
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:27,690
很抱歉 兄弟
I'm sorry, pal.

2090
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:30,560
真的很感谢你给我们的友情价
We really appreciate you offering us such a sweetheart deal.

2091
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:33,190
但我们现在的印刷量不多
But fact is we 're just not doing a whole lot of printing these days.

2092
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,530
- 你也知道  - 对
- You know how it is.  - Yes.

2093
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:36,780
- 世界不同了 对吧  - 对
- It's a whole new world, right?  - Yes.

2094
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:38,780
当然
Sure is.

2095
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:40,610
我是很希望能跟你合作的 老大
I sure wish we could've done business, Cheese.

2096
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,200
好吧 听着…
All right, listen, um,

2097
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:44,740
看来我无法让你改变心意了
if you're sure I can't change your mind there, Don.

2098
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,160
恐怕是如此
Yeah, unfortunately not.

2099
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,040
好吧…
Okay. All right.

2100
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,250
- 祝你假期愉快  - 你也是
- You have a happy holidays.  - You, too, Ned!

2101
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:52,840
代我问候芭芭拉和孩子们
Best to Barb and the kids.

2102
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,260
抱歉 奈德？
Excuse me, Ned?

2103
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,380
你的班机一小时后就要起飞了

2119

Merry Christmas!

2120
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,860
哇
Wow!

2121
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,780
小卢 我有传讯息说要跟你谈谈
Um, Lou, I texted you that I needed to talk to you.

2122
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,950
这到底是…
I mean, what's...

2123

少来了 你们有听到吗？
Come on, you hear this guy?

2124
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,710
银行那个汉克鲁斯
Hank Rouse from First National

2125
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:15,790
一早就留言道贺梅修那笔交易
shot me a congratulatory voicemail this morning about the Mayhew deal.

2126
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,960

You did it, Big Cheese!

2127

你创造了圣诞奇迹
You pulled off the Christmas miracle.

Scotty.

2131
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:30,270
为了表达我们对你的感激
Ned, as a little token of our appreciation,

2132
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,890
我们合资买了东西给你
we all chipped in and bought you something

2133
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,690
我们很确定你没有这玩意
that we're pretty sure you don't own.

2134
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:39,820
你们太客气了
You shouldn't have.

2135
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,490
打开吧…
Open it. Yeah.

2136
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,240

Yeah.

2140
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:53,660
绘图部的人发挥了一点创意
We had a little fun with that down in Graphics.

2141
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:56,000
图片是从史考特的脸书抓的
I got the images off Scotty's Facebook page.

2142
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,510
他看来很正直 就像年轻时的你
He looks like a stand-up guy. Like a younger version of you, Ned.

2143
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:03,220

2145
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,260
致词…
Speech, speech, speech.

2146
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,020
那是什么？
The heck is that?

2147
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:19,480
喷射机跟直升机？这是哪里？
Laird, a jet and a helicopter? Where are we?

2148
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:21,150
等等 宝贝 快到了
Hang on, babe. Almost there.

2149
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:34,290
- 等一下  - 梅修
- One second.  - Mayhew!

2150
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,500
- 你们先等一下  - 去里面拿件外套
- Guys, stay here for a minute.  - Honey, go inside and get a jacket.

2151
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:37,710
- 那是梅修  - 就是他？
- That's Mayhew.  - Is that the guy?

2152
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,790
莱德
Laird!

2153
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,130
我们在哪里？
Where are we?

2154
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:42,670
怪怪的 好像格雷的五十道阴影
That looks weird. It's kind of Fifty Shades of Grey-ish.

2155
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,670
- 冷吗？ - 是啊
- Cold?  - Yeah.

2156
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:49,470
来吧
And here we go.

2157
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:52,560
惊喜
Surprise!

2158
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,600
女儿
Hi, honey.

2159
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,100
登登
Ta-da.

2160
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,230
- 你带我回家？ - 对
- You brought me home?  - Yeah.

2161
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,030
没先跟我说？
Without telling me?

2162
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:06,450
我是违反了神秘约会的规定…
I realize I violated the sanctity of mystery date

2163
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:09,530
但今天应该是合家团圆的日子
but I just thought the family should all be together today.

2164
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,410
你没有资格这么做
Okay, that wasn't your place to do that, hon.

2165
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,410
女儿 我知道…
Steph, I know,

2166
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,000
但今天是圣诞节
but it is Christmas.

2167
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,460
- 很高兴能看到你  - 这不是她要的
- And we're glad to see you.  - This isn't what she wanted.

2168
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,540
确实不是
No, it's not.

2169
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:21,750
我本来希望我们都能在加州过节
What I wanted was for us to spend Christmas in California together

2170
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,340
结果搞得一塌糊涂
like I planned, before everything went to shit

2171
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,260
因为你只想到你自己
because you made it all about yourself.

2172
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:28,430
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

2173
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,300
你们俩都是
You both did.

2174
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:31,720
- 我？ - 对
- I did?  - Yes!

2175
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:34,850
你们两个白痴以为我是你们的财产
You idiots think you can pass me back and forth

2176
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,930
可以传来传去的吗？
like I'm your property or something?

2177
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:37,850
我受够了
I'm done.

2178
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:39,480
这是史上最烂的圣诞节
This is the worst Christmas ever.

2179
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,400
- 女儿  - 乖女儿
- Steph.  - Steph. Honey.

2180
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:47,490
我想她气炸了
I think she's pissed.

2181
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:52,280
对 她气炸了
Yeah, she's pissed.

2182
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,280
靠
Shit!

2183
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:57,660
我只是觉得你们今天应该在一起
I just thought that you guys should be together today.

2184
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,290
好吧 交给你了
All right. Well, I'll leave you to it.

2185
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,590
圣诞快乐 奈德
Happy holidays, Ned.

2186
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,050
你也是 莱德
You too, Laird.

2187
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,680
莱德
Uh, Laird.

2188
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:17,350
你故意慢慢走是因为你不想走吧？
You're doing a "I'm gonna walk away slowly "'cause I really don't wanna leave" walk.

2189
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:21,140
也许吧
Maybe.

2190
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:22,520
过来
Come here.

2191
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:24,860
过来
Come here.

2192
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,940
发生什么事？你没有求婚？
So what happened? You didn't propose?

2193
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,190
我怎么能求？
How could I?

2194
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,360
我们打过勾勾了
I never got your permission

2195
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,360
我没有你的允许就不能开口
and we pinky-swore I wouldn't ask without it.

2196
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,280
你真是个奇葩
You are remarkable.

2197
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:39,830
你没办法骗人吧？
You don't have a gear to be dishonest, do you?

2198
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:42,000
看来是不行
Guess not, dude.

2199
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,130
你不需要我的允许来向史黛芬求婚
Laird, you never needed my permission to ask Stephanie to marry you.

2200
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,970
但若你把它看得这么重…
But if it still means anything to you,

2201
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:54,510
我祝福你们
you have my blessing.

2202
01:32:57,390 --> 01:32:58,310
真假？
For reals?

2203
01:32:58,850 --> 01:32:59,850
我没在乱说
No clowning.

2204
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,480
哇
Whoa.

2205
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:06,650
不过史黛芬是对的
But, Laird, Stephanie's right.

2206
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,150
这应该由她来决定
It's up to her. It's always been up to her.

2207
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,240
不是我们
Not us.

2208
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:14,200
我一直到现在才了解
It just took me a while to realize that.

2209
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:16,660
好中肯
It's so true.

2210
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,080
我们真是混蛋
Dude, we were such jerks.

2211
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,450
是啊
Yeah.

2212
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:21,830
我咬了你老二
I bit your dick.

2213
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,000
热狗加蛋
Shaft and balls. Oh.

2214
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,630
对不起
I'm sorry.

2215
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:29,880
我也很对不起
I'm sorry, too, dude.

2216
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:33,090
听着 如果你想向史黛芬求婚
Look, Laird, if you wanna ask Stephanie to marry you

2217
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,340
时机一来 就问她吧
when the time is right, just do it.

2218
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,970
好 那我可以现在问吗？
Okay. Is it cool if I do it right now?

2219
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,390
因为我想说可能会成功…
Because, uh, just in case it worked out

2220
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,600
就叫老古在直升机里塞了一堆白鸽
I had Goose put a shit ton of doves in the helicopter

2221
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:46,230
我还有另外两个惊喜
and I have a couple other surprises.

2222
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,820
莱德 你决定就好
Laird, this is totally your call.

2223
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,940
但我可以给点建议吗？
But can I give you some advice?

2224
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:52,610
当然了
Dude, please.

2225
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,450
- 我现在他妈的超紧张  - 好…
- I'm so fucking nervous right now.  - All right, look...

2226
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:58,120
史黛芬不在乎华而不实的东西
Stephanie doesn't care about all the bells and whistles.

2227
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,910
你知道她的
You know her.

2228
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,450
她在乎的是你
She cares about you.

2229
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,040
她爱你
She loves you.

2230
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,380
你就单膝下跪
So you get down on one knee

2231
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,670
对她说出你的肺腑之言
and you speak to her from your heart.

2232
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:12,170
这个你最会了
That's what you're best at.

2233
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:15,800
是不是 贾丝汀？
Isn't that right, Justine?

2234
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,350
我完全同意
Totally agree.

2235
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:19,890
哇靠
Holy shit.

2236
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:23,180
我第一次来密西根 冷死我了
My first time in Michigan. It's cold as balls here.

2237
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,230
是啊
Yeah.

2238
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,730
他妈的太赞了
Dude, that's fucking great!

2239
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,690
奈德·弗莱明风格
Do it Ned Fleming style.

2240
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:31,440
老派做法
Old school!

2241
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,690
水啦
Fuck yes.

2242
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:36,570
好吧 听着…
Okay. Well, look...

2243
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:38,620
我会想办法让她出来
I'll go in there and see if I can get her to come out.

2244
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:39,740
好
Okay.

2245
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:41,580
- 祝你好运  - 谢了
- Good luck.  - Thanks.

2246
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,080
答应我一件事
Hey, promise me one thing.

2247
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:49,920
你会好好待她
You will treat her well.

2248
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:54,420
我会把她当作屌他妈的女王
Dude, I'm gonna treat her like a motherfucking queen.

2249
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,470
我接受
I'll take that.

2250
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:58,640
好
Okay.

2251
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,680
古斯塔 改变计划
Gustav, change of plans.

2252
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:05,520
我们要求婚 其他的都不要
We're go on the proposal. No go on all that other shit.

2253
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,150
讯号不太好 你说要按计划进行？
I have only one bar. You're saying we are a go, yes?

2254
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:09,860
不 不要
No. No go.

2255
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:12,070
只要求婚 其他的不要
Go on the proposal, no go on the shit.

2256
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:14,150
莱德 你是说“不要”
Laird, are you saying it's a no go

2257
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,490
还是“不 要”？
or are you saying, "No. Go."?

2258
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:17,650
夭寿哦 老古
God damn it, Goose.

2259
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:19,450
你害我他妈的更紧张 闭嘴啦
You're making me fucking nervous. Just shut up.

2260
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:21,200
抱歉 祝你好运
Oh, I'm sorry. Good luck.

2261
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:23,700
对了 记得要呼吸
Oh, and by the way, please, Laird, breathe.

2262
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,620
好
Okay.

2263
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,790
也别骂脏话
And no cursing, okay?

2264
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,540
靠 你说的对
Fuck, you're right. Good call.

2265
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,420
嗨
Hi.

2266
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:38,800
对不起
I'm sorry.

2267
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:42,930
我知道我在加州让你失望了
I know that out in California I disappointed you

2268
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,020
我很难过
and that kills me.

2269
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:46,810
我真的很抱歉
And I'm really sorry.

2270
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,270
我也很抱歉
I'm sorry, too.

2271
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,940
我不该要你来 害你手足无措
I threw you in the deep end out there. I should've never asked you to come.

2272
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:57,110
我是说真的…
Honestly. No.

2273
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,700
不 你没有做错事
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

2274
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:01,280
- 我在想什么啊？ - 是我不好
- What was I thinking?  - It was me.

2275
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,700
只是 当我们去莱德家
It's just that, when we got out to Laird's...

2276
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,040
我觉得我好像不认识你了
I just didn't feel like I knew you anymore

2277
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,710
我吓坏了
and I got scared.

2278
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:15,130
然后我就抓狂了
I just went crazy.

2279
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,130
我还是我
This is me.

2280
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,050
我很好
I'm doing good.

2281
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,060
爸
Oh, Dad.

2282
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:33,230
天啊
Oh, my God.

2283
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,820
听着 我忘了…
Okay, look. I forgot...

2284
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:37,070
- 天啊 他还在外面  - 我知道
- Oh, God. He's still out there.  - I know.

2285
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:38,360
只穿背心和围巾
In a tank top and a scarf.

2286
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:40,740
- 亏他还知道要来密西根  - 是啊
- And he knew we were coming to Michigan.  - Yeah.

2287
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,410
- 他干嘛不进来？ - 他有事要问你
- Why doesn't he just come inside?  - He has to talk to you about something...

2288
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:46,080
他想向你道歉吧
He kind of wants to make things right with you.

2289
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,660
- 是吗？ - 对
- Oh, does he?  - Yeah.

2290
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:50,910
如果你能给他一个机会就好了
I think it'd be cool if you gave him a chance.

2291
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:55,170
你要我给莱德机会？
You want me to give Laird a chance?

2292
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:59,090
我只是觉得如果你给他机会
I thought that if you saw fit to give him a chance...

2293
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:01,930
会蛮酷的
I thought that it'd be cool.

2294
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,260
就这样 你说呢？
That's all. well?

2295
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:07,100
- 嗨  - 嘿
- Hi.  - Hey.

2296
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,220
什么事？天啊 外面好冷
What's going on? Oh, my God, it's cold out here.

2297
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:11,520
我知道你很怒 但请你听我说
I know you're pissed, but just hear me out.

2298
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,100
- 可以进去说吗？ - 不行
- Can we talk inside?  - No.

2299
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,230
- 天啊…  - 你看
- Oh, my...  - Look.

2300
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,020
我的天 好浪漫
Oh, my God. It's so romantic.

2301
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:19,780
- 我跟他说简单就好  - 宝贝女儿
- I told him to keep it simple.  - Oh, our little girl.

2302
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:21,950
他会单膝下跪 一切从简
He's gonna get down to his knee and keep it real simple.

2303
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,360
你怎么知道？
How do you know all this?

2304
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:25,280
我有给他一点提示
I gave him a few pointers. Oh.

2305
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,120
这是我这辈子最快乐的一年
This has been the happiest year of my life.

2306
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,210
飞吧 快…
And fly! Go, go, go! Go!

2307
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,550
我的天
Oh, my God.

2308
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,800
老古 该死 我说不要…
Goose. God damn it. I said no go! No go!

2309
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,060
- 老天…  - 天啊 哇
- Oh, my...  - Oh, gosh. Wow.

2310
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,140
- 他干嘛那样？ - 真聪明
- Why did he do that?  - Smart boy.

2311
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:52,310
真是屎从天降
Absolute fucking shit fest.

2312
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,100
宝贝 对不起
Babe, I'm so sorry. Uh...

2313
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,820
史黛芬·弗莱明…
Stephanie Fleming...

2314
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,650
- 你愿意…  - 你在求婚吗？
- will you...  - Are you proposing?

2315
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:03,650
是啊
Yeah.

2316
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:06,950
我爸知道吗？
Mmm-hmm. Did my dad know about this?

2317
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:10,740
对 他一到加州 我就问过他了
Yeah, I asked for his blessing that first morning back in Cali.

2318
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:11,910
我的天
Oh, my God.

2319
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:14,410
我的天
Oh, my God!

2320
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:17,080
难怪他那么暴躁 你哦…
No wonder he acted so crazy. Honey.

2321
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,170
对 他变得不太理智
Yeah, that's why he was a little out of whack.

2322
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,420
我们本来能好好过节的
Yeah, we could have had a really nice holiday.

2323
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:24,340
我知道 但现在都没事了
I know. But we're all good now. Okay?

2324
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:26,640
这事很重大
This is a lot.

2325
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,510

2327
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:34,020
老古 不要

01:38:57,170 --> 01:39:00,500
莱德 吻乐团怎么在这里？
Laird, what is Kiss doing here?

2332
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:02,460

01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,670
- 那是…  - 哇
- Is that...  - Whoa!

2334
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,050
他找了模仿的乐团
He got look-a-likes!

2335
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:10,510
不是模仿的 那是吉恩跟保罗
Those aren't look-a-likes, Ned. That's Gene and Paul.

2336
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,640
是吉恩跟保罗…
It's Gene and Paul! Gene and Paul!

2343
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:31,530

but your dad gave me this awesome advice and told me not to do it.

大家自然一点…
Everybody act natural! Act naturally!

2357

我得重新装潢屋子
I have to redecorate the house!

2358

01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:40,480
我们加入“吻之军团”有三十年了
We've been members of the Kiss Army for, like, 30 years now.

2370
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:43,310
第一次约会就是看“疯狂夜”巡回
Yeah. Our first date was the Crazy Nights Tour.

2371
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,940
对 那真是疯狂
Yeah! And, boy, was that crazy.

2372

2373
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,820
你们有上床吗？
Did you get laid?

2374

I'm having an awesome time, but are you having a buffet here?

2377
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:03,830
天啊 我在想什么？
Oh, my God. What was I thinking?

2378
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,420
- 你们饿了吗？ - 饿扁了
- Are you hungry?  - Starving.

2379
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,340
老天 我们真是太失礼了
Oh, God, of course! Where's our manners?

2380
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,420
什么烂主人嘛
We're terrible hosts.

帮他们拿吉他 斧头给我吧
Let's get those guitars, guys. Come on, let me get that axe.

2384

我差点忘了他们
Oh! I almost forgot about them.

2385
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:22,020
- 这个嘛…  - 甜蜜的一对
- Well...  - The happy couple.

2386

恭喜你们
Congratulations.

2387
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:25,440
她拒绝了
She said no.

2388
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,360
抱歉 什么？
I'm sorry, what?

2389
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,820
她拒绝了
She said no.

2390
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:31,690
我…
Well...

2391
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,530
宝贝
Honey.

2392
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,830
你想娶我
I'm so flattered

2393
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,990
让我受宠若惊
that you wanna marry me

2394
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:40,450
但我还没准备好
but I'm not ready for that.

2395
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,380
而且我要念完大学
And I'm gonna finish school.

2396
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:46,840
为了我自己
For me.

2397
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,460
因为那是我要的
Because that's what I wanna do.

2398
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:50,130
懂吗？
Got it?

2399
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,970
真聪明
That's really smart.

2400
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:54,880
只是 我的大计划…
It's just, I had this big plan

2401
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:57,300
终究没成功
and it didn't work out.

2402
01:41:58,140 --> 01:42:00,220
这就是人生 小子
Yeah. Well, that's life, pal.

2403
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:04,890
你说得真好
That is so well put, Ned.

2404
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:07,360
真的超聪明的
It's really, really smart.

2405
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,190
是你想出来的吗？
Dude, did you come up with that?

2406
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,980
你说“这就是人生”？
The words, "That's life?"

2407
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:13,820
奈德 你真的好有智慧
Ned, you're so full of practical wisdom...

2408
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:17,070
我只是很期待能成为你的女婿
I was just really looking forward to you being my father-in-law.

2409
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:21,240
我又没有要跟你分手
I'm not breaking up with you.

2410
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,410
没有吗？
You're not?

2411
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:23,580
没有
No, honey.

2412
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,080
我还是你的女朋友
No, no, no. I'm still your girlfriend.

2413
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:27,000
我们还在一起
We're still together.

2414
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:30,670
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God!

2415
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:31,920

2416
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:42,680
[固特异]

圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

2418
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,100
- 奈德  - 嘿
- Ned.  - Hey.

2419
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:46,900
你的员工好酷哦
Dude, your employees are so cool.

2420
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,270
确实如此
Yeah, they are.

2421
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,610
也许我不该那样介入…
Maybe it was wrong of me to interfere like that,

2422
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:52,610
但你何不让我救你的公司？
but why don't you let me save your company?

2423
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,700
我不能那么做
No, Laird, I can't.

2424
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,860
旧的模式已经不适用了
That old model doesn't work anymore.

2425
01:42:58,030 --> 01:42:59,950
我猜…
I guess... I don't know.

2426
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,910
我之前只是不想承认吧
I guess I just didn't want to believe it.

2427
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:04,410
但既然你提起了
But since you mentioned it...

2428
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,710
我想要你听听我的点子
I do have a business idea I wanna run by you.

2429
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:08,460
老兄 放马过来
Dude, elevator pitch me!

2430
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:09,790
好
Okay.

2431
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:12,460
不 等一下
No, hold on.

2432
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:14,960
这不是我的点子 你等等
This wasn't my idea at all. One second.

2433
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,880
- 史考特 过来  - 什么事？
- Scotty, come here.  - Yo, what's up?

2434
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:17,880

2435
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:20,970
把你在飞机上说的点子告诉莱德
I want you to tell Laird about the business idea you mentioned on the plane.

2436
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:22,140
- 说吧  - 真的吗？
- Go ahead.  - Wait, really?

2437
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:23,100
对
Yeah.

2438
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,930
就叫你坐上桌了 小老弟
Told you to get that seat at the table, bro.

2439
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,640
没错 爸 他跟我说…
You did. He told me, Dad. He was, like...

2440
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:29,150
“你要坐上桌” 我终于办到了
"You're gonna get that seat." I can't believe I finally got the seat.

2441
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:30,560
龙跟奶子 宝贝
Dragons and titties, baby.

2442
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:32,110
龙跟奶子
Dragons and titties!

2443
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:34,150
喷火吧
Breathe that fire.

2444
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,320
好好享受
Get up in there.

2445
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,150
享受那些奶子
Get up in those titties!

2446
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,320
我要得到那些龙
Gonna get those dragons.

2447
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:41,410
爸…
Dad...

2448
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,410
史考特
Scotty!

2449
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:46,160
别玩你爸的奶了 快做简报
Stop motorboating your dad, and elevator pitch me.

2450
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:47,160
抱歉
Sorry. Uh...

2451
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,920
莱德 我对你的马桶念念不忘
Laird, I can't stop thinking about your toilets, dude.

2452
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,790
- 我的马桶？ - 对
- My toilets?  - Yeah.

2453
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,630
那股清爽感 香氛爽身粉
The fresh feeling, the scented talc.

2454
