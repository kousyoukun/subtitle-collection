4
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:02,083
Four Peter's Ships with sturgeon,
and six Bronze Horsemen with game.

5
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,416
Our game pies are becoming popular.

6
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
It's because they're
on offer now, two for the price of one.

7
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,416
You should've been a pharmacist.

8
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,916
All thumbs and no fingers…

9
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,416
-And the bells?
-I forgot.

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,208
Next time it'll cost you your job.

11
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,208
Into the oven.

12
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,000
Well now, let's give you
that golden brown crust.

13
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,375
That's a fine pie.

14
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,208
To the shop.

15
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,083
Le Grand Pirogue delivery at your service.

16
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,750
Yes, delivery for noon. 32 Mokhovaya St.

17
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,375
Merchant Terentev?
Has he placed his Christmas order yet?

18
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,916
Yes, for 50 pies.

19
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,125
Who's the fastest out of you lot?

20
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:08,958
You, come here.

21
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,125
32 Mokhovaya St. You have 20 minutes.

22
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,666
Excuse me.

23
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,166
Hey, buddy.

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,375
Move it, you lazy horse!

25
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,375
Excuse me.

26
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,958
Make way! Coming through!

27
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,416
-What happened?
-They closed off everything again.

28
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:51,666
…I said to him, "With a voice like yours,
everything comes out as nonsense."

29
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,333
So that's that…

30
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,125
Would you
look at that scoundrel! Grab him!

31
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,333
Stop, you!

32
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,083
Young people these days…

33
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,291
Get up.

34
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,791
Everyone, remain calm.

35
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,416
And keep the noise down!

36
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,833
Think you're above the law?

37
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,333
What law would that be?

38
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,833
Well, it's obvious.
They told us to wait, so we're waiting.

39
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,833
We're turning back now!

40
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,750
Lunch is served, Your Excellency.

41
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,083
Thank you, Fyodor.

42
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,875
Darling…

43
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,291
Miss Jackson. Alice. Be seated.

44
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,708
We received an invitation
to the Grand Duke's New Year ball.

45
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,750
The theme of the ball
will be traditional Russian style.

46
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,000
-Is patriotism back in fashion?
-Indeed it is.

47
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,958
I already made a deal with
the Mariinsky Theatre costume artist.

48
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,916
He will make our costumes.

49
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We'll be the talk of the night.

50
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,708
"To mark the turn of the century,
the gas lamps of the Eiffel Tower

51
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,666
will be replaced with electric lights."

52
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,875
The French are still hoping
to bring back their lost grandeur,

53
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:43,708
but I'm certain they won't succeed
in the 20th century. Mark my words.

54
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,916
At least women in France
can go into higher education.

55
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,833
Alice, are you still going
on about that? This is so tiresome.

56
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,583
Universities produce nothing
but free-thinkers and troublemakers.

57
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,291
A respectable lady
has no business in such establishments.

58
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,166
Excuse me, Miss Jackson…

59
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:22,083
Note, Alice, we heard the opinion
of an educated European woman.

60
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,250
Now let's
close this subject once and for all.

61
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,208
What does
Queen Victoria have to do with this?

62
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,083
Something just touched me under the table.

63
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,875
Perhaps it was a spirit…

64
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,041
Or an astral body.

65
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,708
Alice, haven't I told you not to bring
that animal into the dining room?

66
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,916
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

67
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,833
That's your dismissal pay.
You're fired. Hand over the box.

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,166
I don't understand.

69
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,583
You were late. Terentev called me in
a rage and canceled his Christmas order.

70
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,916
The road was blocked,
they weren't letting anyone through.

71
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,791
I'll make it up to you.

72
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,083
I know your type.

73
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,500
Go easy on you once
and you act like you own the place.

74
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,458
Don't call me a "type."

75
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,250
I demand full pay for all my
working days for the past month!

76
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,833
You "demand"? Very well then.

77
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,666
-Out you go.
-This is not fair!

78
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,708
It's me.

79
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,000
-Did you bring it?
-Yes.

80
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:27,875
Ma'am, please don't be angry with me.
It started croaking, and I had to…

81
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a sin, I am so sorry.

82
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,083
I'm not angry. Thank you, Prosha.

83
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,458
And this, just like you asked.

84
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,208
What do you need the frog for?
Some divination ritual?

85
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,958
It's Yuletide today. I want to do
some fortune-telling for my betrothed,

86
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:55,166
but for that I need a mirror…
like the one you have here.

87
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,708
Can I come in the evening?

88
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,958
You, get off my crate!

89
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,333
Hey, what the…

90
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,250
Excuse me, my fault.

91
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,500
Let me help you brush off the snow, sir.

92
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,791
Wait!

93
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,833
You dropped something!

94
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,416
Whoa, you rascal!

95
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,250
Hey!

96
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,958
Why are you following me?

97
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,625
You dropped this.

98
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,708
You're fast.
Who taught you to skate so well?

99
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,916
I do this for work.

100
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,541
I mean, I used to do this for work.

101
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,333
Le Grand Pirogue delivery--

102
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,750
They fired you? When?

103
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,375
-Today.
-I congratulate you.

104
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,833
-What for?
-For starting a new life.

105
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,166
So you need a new job then?

106
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,666
Yes, I do.

107
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,833
Come to the Devil's Bridge at midnight.

108
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,791
Do you know where that is?

109
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,666
Son, I lost my balance, that's all.

110
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,208
Good thing you were there.

111
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,583
Sheer luck.

112
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,375
That's what you think.

113
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,125
There's no such thing as luck.
Everything is written.

114
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,500
Dad, what if
a big chunk of ice falls from a roof

115
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,666
and kills someone? Is it also written?

116
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,208
Well, it depends.

117
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,208
If it kills a governor, they might
start clearing roofs of ice… for once.

118
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:56,250
Matvey, what's wrong? You look upset.

119
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
I can tell. What happened?

120
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,750
Forget it. Let's go.

121
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,291
Did they fire you?

122
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,000
There's no point fretting over it, my boy.

123
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,333
You're a smart lad.

124
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,375
You'll find a new job,
far better than the old one.

125
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,125
God willing,
we'll make it through this month.

126
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,291
Hey, want to be a lamplighter like me?

127
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,375
You wait and see,
one day everything will be electric.

128
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,041
-It's all malarkey, son.
-No, it's the future.

129
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:42,000
Look at these blades.
Razor-sharp. That's Dutch quality for you.

130
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,208
Remember when you gave them to me,
you said they were magic skates?

131
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,000
That's what my father told me.

132
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,708
It's a family tradition.

133
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:55,541
And since they've lasted that long,
then they most certainly are magical.

134
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,625
I bet they'll outlive electricity.

135
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,583
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

136
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,125
I like this piece. Who's the composer?

137
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,708
Claude Debussy.

138
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,666
Pity he's not Russian.

139
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,833
I've noticed you usually play this
before asking me for something.

140
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes, don't deny it.

141
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,916
You have a gift of clairvoyance.

142
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,875
It's my curse.

143
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,375
Alice's insolent behavior

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,500
has been getting out of hand lately.

145
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,541
Today, in the dining room,
she was openly rude to you.

146
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,708
How do you suggest
I deal with that? Whip her?

147
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,416
Marriage is a good way
to calm even the hottest of heads.

148
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,458
Darling, I agree,
but finding a good match would take time.

149
00:14:56,041 --> 00:15:00,708
Is there not a single suitable
candidate in all of St. Petersburg?

150
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,125
Lordy! What sort of sorcery is this?

151
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,083
This is science.

152
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,750
"Higher Courses For Women
invites new students."

153
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:56,583
My betrothed,
come and show your face to me.

154
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,666
May I turn off the electricity?
It's too bright in here.

155
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,750
I'll bring you a kerosene lamp.

156
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,666
Are you lost, brother?

157
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,416
I was told to come here… by him.

158
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,041
He's a friend.

159
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,000
This is Duke, this is Genghis, I'm Alex.

160
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,333
Nice to meet you. I'm Matvey.

161
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,625
And this here is Fly.

162
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,416
Why do they call you Fly?

163
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,958
Because I'm impossible to catch.

164
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,083
I see.

165
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,541
My betrothed,
come and show your face to me.

166
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Why don't you come to me, you bastard?

167
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you want to have a go?
The candles are already lit.

168
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,583
-I don't believe in fortune-telling.
-How come? My parents met that way.

169
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,500
And my grandparents too.
They were married the next day

170
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,916
and lived happily for 40 years.
How can you not believe in it?

171
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,416
I don't believe we're destined
to be with a single person

172
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,250
out of a billion people on this planet.

173
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,708
What's a "billion"?

174
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,666
-Have you been doing this long?
-Doing what?

175
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,375
Well, stealing.

176
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,166
It's not stealing. You can't steal
from people what doesn't belong to them.

177
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,416
To whom exactly?

178
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,041
To the usurpers.

179
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,041
People who live off other people.

180
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:13,000
Merchants, landlords, officers, ministers…

181
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,416
Their name is Legion, for they are many.

182
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,875
Everything they
supposedly "own" doesn't belong to them.

183
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,916
It's only temporarily in their possession.

184
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,166
Is the Tsar… also an usurper?

185
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,666
Are you, perchance, an agent
of the state? Asking such questions…

186
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,750
Lads, I'm not…

187
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,208
I was joking.

188
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,916
Shall we go for a ride?

189
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,708
There's nothing more humiliating
than being the slave of a slave.

190
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,250
Your ex-master is a slave to
his money, like all of the bourgeoisie.

191
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,875
Burj… What is it again?

192
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,875
Bourgeoisie. The ruling class of society

193
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,208
that lives off their capitalistic income,
earned for them by hired labor.

194
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,000
Alex, you're doing his head in!

195
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,375
What are you staring at?

196
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,500
The same coat of arms was
on the carriage they blocked the road for.

197
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,416
-A lion chomping on a broom?
-That's rich.

198
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
-Is that bourgeoisie as well?
-No, that is aristocracy.

199
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,041
That calls for a punishment.

200
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,833
You're flying too low, Fly.
Don't get us all busted.

201
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,833
-Come on, grab hold of his nipple.
-But be gentle.

202
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,125
Come on, hurry up.

203
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,708
Start drawing, and make it pretty.

204
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,833
Busted.

205
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,500
Please don't scream…

206
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,291
That was entertaining to watch.

207
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,750
Hurry, let's get out of here.

208
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,750
She got you good and proper.

209
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,500
What a temper!

210
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,083
Lads!

211
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,291
I'll go now. My home is that way.

212
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,083
All right then.

213
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,666
We could use your hands,
even if slightly burned.

214
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,416
And your feet,

215
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,083
even in those odd-looking skates.

216
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,166
You can find us at the Ice Fair.

217
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,625
I'll think about it.
It was nice to meet you.

218
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,708
-See you later.
-Bye.

219
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,375
He won't be back. Too squeaky clean.

220
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,791
Want to bet?

221
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,250
Good morning, ma'am! Sleep well?

222
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,625
So you did some
fortune-telling last night, didn't you?

223
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,833
Your nose always itches afterwards.

224
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,208
Well, did you see your betrothed?

225
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,458
Is he handsome? Did you like him?

226
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,833
Is he an officer?

227
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,083
With a mustache? A nobleman?

228
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,750
No, quite the opposite.

229
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,583
What's "opposite"?

230
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,083
Tonight's dinner
with the Shuvalovs will seal my fate.

231
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,375
I'll be asking for
their Sonya's hand in marriage.

232
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:35,958
Why bother? Everyone knows
that Count Shuvalov is deep in debt.

233
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,875
He lost all of his connections
at the court. His career is over.

234
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:43,000
-Don't get angry with me, but…
-Gentlemen, take your seats!

235
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,541
…these are nothing but dirty rumors.

236
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,583
They say the minister's daughter
is up for grabs now.

237
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,791
The biggest catch in all of the city.

238
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,250
Her late mother left her quite a fortune.

239
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,458
Let us begin.

240
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:14,916
What I have here is the latest
model of the police truncheon.

241
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,583
Given our government's
modernization policy,

242
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:26,041
we believe it appropriate to replace
some of our sabers with these truncheons.

243
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,875
They deliver a good blow

244
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:32,625
and have proven highly
effective in dispersing protests.

245
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:38,208
A most important point to note is that,
unlike the sabers we have now,

246
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:43,791
the use of truncheons does not
result in death or serious injury.

247
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,791
There.

248
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:52,041
What doesn't kill you,
so to speak, makes you wiser.

249
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,708
Those sayings of his!

250
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:58,125
Trang… Trunk… Cheon?

251
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,333
Are you suggesting
importing them from England?

252
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:06,500
No. These are made here in Russia.

253
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:13,416
There's a factory near Tula that can
make up to 10,000 of them a year.

254
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,958
Gentlemen, who has something to say?

255
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:27,375
Count Arkady Trubetskoy,
Department of Public Order and Safety.

256
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,416
Given the current political
tensions in the country,

257
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,625
such a move could be
misinterpreted by the populace.

258
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,958
If potential protesters cease
to fear the gendarme's saber,

259
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,166
it could lead to
unpredictable consequences.

260
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,000
I say that, at the present time,

261
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,666
such an initiative goes against
the state interests of our country.

262
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,666
You're too early in your career

263
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,375
to think about the national interests.

264
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:55,000
I beg your pardon,
I was merely stating my opinion.

265
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:59,083
Are you by any chance related
to Count Mikhail Trubetskoy?

266
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,791
Yes, Your Excellency. He is my father.

267
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:03,958
I see.

268
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,000
This factory near Tula…

269
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,875
Yes, Your Excellency?

270
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:13,208
Does it, perchance,
belong to your father-in-law?

271
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,166
This is pure coincidence.

272
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,416
They offered the best price.

273
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,666
I bet they did.

274
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,583
Have a seat.

275
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:35,041
I think that, right now,
you should be focusing your efforts

276
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,000
not on these truncheons,

277
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,916
but on the rising
incidence of pickpocketing.

278
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,250
-It's normal for the holiday season.
-What?

279
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,583
-Your Excellency…
-Yes?

280
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:52,500
Apparently, the bandits
are accomplished ice skaters.

281
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,875
As far as I know, most thefts
are taking place at the Ice Fair.

282
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,375
Yes, the bastards are speedy.

283
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,750
They often get away from the gendarmes.

284
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:04,583
That problem can be solved.

285
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,041
Do you have an idea for a solution?

286
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:20,083
The sausage is delicious.

287
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,375
Hey!

288
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,750
I'll be back later.

289
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,958
-So, are you in?
-Yes.

290
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,125
You lost your bet.

291
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,250
Let's see if you're any good.

292
00:27:55,666 --> 00:28:00,833
Timing is crucial. You need to be
in the right place at the right time.

293
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,333
Then everything
will just fall into your hands.

294
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,958
That's the secret.
And thanks to our skates, we're so quick,

295
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:18,291
the bourgeoisie don't even notice us
taking the weight off their pockets.

296
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,166
You're quick on your skates,

297
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,791
but you have to be quick
with your hands too. Watch me.

298
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,416
See what I did? Now you try.

299
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,375
We'll work on your
sleight of hand and speed of reaction.

300
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:37,250
You'll train until it becomes natural.

301
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:41,041
Your hands should do all the work for you.

302
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,833
We call this trick the Road Accident.

303
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:55,041
Gotta be more careful.
Well, this could happen to anyone.

304
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,833
This is the Spinning Top. You spin
a gentleman until he loses some weight.

305
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:00,708
Why Spinning Top?

306
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,791
It just sounds nice.

307
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:08,916
Chapter 13, "The way to a capitalist's
heart lies through his wallet."

308
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,416
-After each ex…
-What?

309
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,041
Expropriation. You have to
get rid of what you got.

310
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:19,458
For that we have a special
deposit box. Tea, please.

311
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,625
That'll be 15 kopecks.

312
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,708
Four out of ten!

313
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,500
It has to be ten out of ten…

314
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,208
ten times in a row.

315
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,041
You know what this is?

316
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,583
-A coin.
-It's more than that.

317
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,666
In order to procure gold,
you need some silver.

318
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,500
We call this trick a Hole in the Pocket.

319
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,708
Most rich people don't know
where their money goes anyway.

320
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,125
Son, where do you go every day?

321
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,208
I got a new job, Dad.

322
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:15,083
I told you you would. What is it?

323
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:19,250
It's a… partnership venture.

324
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,166
And what does this partnership do?

325
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:24,458
Expropriation.

326
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,416
Sounds interesting. A new industry?

327
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:29,833
Sort of.

328
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,375
Well done, son. I'm proud of you.

329
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,666
Drink up.

330
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,375
I can't look at milk anymore.

331
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,541
Don't look at it. Drink it.

332
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,416
-You at least have the skin.
-Dad…

333
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,500
They're richer than I thought.

334
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,000
They also own
a lavish estate on Lake Ladoga,

335
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,083
vintage vineyards near Nice,

336
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:08,916
and a palace in Yalta,
soon to feature a private golf course.

337
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,625
A private what?

338
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,166
-Not now, Mother.
-Let's go.

339
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,166
-Your Nobleness.
-Thank you.

340
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,250
Count and Countess Trubetskoy.

341
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,791
I am delighted to see you.

342
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,625
What?

343
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,958
-Countess.
-Duke.

344
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:32,875
And, Count… Please meet my wife
Severina and my daughter Alice.

345
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,708
Very pleased to meet you.

346
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,666
Thank you very much
for inviting us, Duke. It's a great honor.

347
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:44,250
Your late father and I
served together in the Caucasus.

348
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,583
Why have you never asked me for patronage?

349
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:51,416
I believe that a man should be
judged by his work, not his relatives.

350
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,541
-Like father, like son.
-Mother…

351
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:57,333
-All right, all right.
-Countess, it's good to see you again.

352
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,291
After you.

353
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,125
I do hope you will enjoy
tonight's performance.

354
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,333
Thank you.

355
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:28,416
The Gemini. This constellation
consists of two bright stars

356
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,000
that are very close to one another.

357
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:39,208
Gemini is the first
air sign in the zodiac.

358
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,416
They tend towards duality

359
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,458
and are constantly chasing
something unattainable.

360
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,708
Air is their element,
Mercury is their planet.

361
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:58,625
Their interests are
literature and politics.

362
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:06,291
Famous Geminis include
Peter the Great, Aleksandr Pushkin…

363
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,500
and my husband.

364
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,083
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

365
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,208
Gentlemen, I must steal
my husband from you.

366
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,250
-Excuse me.
-I missed you, darling.

367
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:28,750
Count, how did you like the performance?

368
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:32,291
It was amazing, I enjoyed it immensely.

369
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,458
It was splendid, darling.

370
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,958
Duke, I'd like to take this opportunity…

371
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:41,958
The Imperial Ice Skating Club
is soon having its annual Ice Ball, and--

372
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:45,416
I'm afraid, ice skating isn't
the sharpest of my skills.

373
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,708
I meant to invite your daughter.

374
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,291
I think it's a marvelous idea.

375
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:57,583
My husband and I have been discussing
arranging more social outings for Alice.

376
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,541
We will consider your proposition

377
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,291
and inform you
of our decision in due time.

378
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,791
Thank you.

379
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,291
Good morning!

380
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,083
Rise and shine, everyone!
Time to go to work!

381
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:25,333
Early bird gets the worm.

382
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,625
Good morning!

383
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:46,750
Dad…

384
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:52,833
Let's go to a hospital
and have a doctor see you.

385
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:59,916
Doctors only treat the human body,
but all diseases come from the soul.

386
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,666
Cough again for me please.

387
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,416
You can get dressed now.

388
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,375
Will you admit him to the hospital?

389
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,000
No, there's no need for that.

390
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,208
Thank God. Told you it's nothing serious.

391
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:28,083
But he coughs up blood…
What can we do to stop that?

392
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:32,166
Hot milk should ease his symptoms.

393
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,583
Now if you'll excuse me--

394
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:34,833
Thank you.

395
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,000
The checkup is free.

396
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,708
Dad, wait here.

397
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,875
Doctor, there has to be
a treatment for this.

398
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,958
Too late. He has advanced tuberculosis.

399
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,375
I didn't want him to hear it,
but we can't help him at this point.

400
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:55,291
But there's got to be something,
somewhere, that can be done for him.

401
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,583
The only doctor who has success
with such cases is Dr. Tyshler

402
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:02,291
who runs a clinic in Baden-Baden,
Germany. It's terribly expensive.

403
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:07,000
-You could never afford it.
-Would Tyshler be able to cure him?

404
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:13,625
Son, the doctor has real patients
to see to. What I have is a simple cold.

405
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:14,958
Dr. Tyshler is the only one.

406
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,083
Come on.

407
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:28,458
He's just asking for it. It's your debut.

408
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,041
Go for it.

409
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,541
Not bad for the first time.

410
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,750
How much for a ride?

411
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,333
You just push the sleigh

412
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,000
and distract the customer
at the right time.

413
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,166
-Where to, sir?
-It's my turn now!

414
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,041
-Sir, I'm the fastest!
-Take me to Nikolskaya St.

415
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,166
-Easy, young man.
-Of course.

416
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,083
Is this your
first day on the job or something?

417
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,166
Remember how we got here?

418
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,916
This is so far from the city,
there's not a soul around.

419
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,916
Exactly.

420
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,208
We don't want any neighbors.

421
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,708
A ship?

422
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,083
Does it have a name?

423
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,666
Sure it does. The Old Leakey.

424
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:54,333
If things go well, by spring,
we'll patch up the holes, the sails and…

425
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,250
-And off we go.
-Go where?

426
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,000
Into the bright future.

427
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,916
-Welcome aboard.
-Go on, don't be shy.

428
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,125
Help me sort the loot.

429
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,666
That's what I call a good harvest.

430
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,250
A batch of fresh holiday cash.

431
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,208
Still smells of ink.

432
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,416
What's this?

433
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,875
I don't know.

434
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,791
It was in the man's pocket
in place of his wallet.

435
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,375
So what is it?

436
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,708
It's an invitation…

437
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:53,458
to the ball
at the Imperial Ice Skating Club.

438
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,791
All the fattest cats
in town will be there.

439
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,166
Two invitations.

440
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,666
You and I go. It'll be a goldmine.

441
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,083
With a face like yours, no way
they'll let you in, invitation or not.

442
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,375
-Your face is no better.
-I'm not volunteering to go.

443
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,625
It's simple!

444
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,250
Matvey will choose whom to take with him.

445
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,833
-Me?
-With him?

446
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,125
He got lucky once!
The kid has no experience!

447
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:27,000
He was skilled enough
to get us these invitations.

448
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,958
So you're saying they won't
let me in, but they'll let him in?

449
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,166
Dressed in those rags?

450
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:41,875
You're right.

451
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,333
We work on his style.

452
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,666
And finally, your skates.

453
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,750
-What about my skates?
-Let's have a closer look at them.

454
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,083
Here.

455
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,291
They're too conspicuous.
Let them rest tonight.

456
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,416
-But--
-You don't want to get noticed.

457
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,041
You look very aristocratic.

458
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,208
A true baron.

459
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,916
The more expensive your outfit,

460
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,500
the less suspicion
you arouse among the gentry.

461
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:51,500
Here, clothes make the man.
We're using their prejudices against them.

462
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:57,875
I tell you, my dear, there is absolutely
nothing to do in Paris in the winter.

463
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,375
Count Bobrinsky and I
nearly died of boredom!

464
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,583
-Hey, what a slow reader you are!
-Welcome, sirs.

465
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,041
-Your skates, Duchess.
-Thank you.

466
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:09,916
What a cute dog!

467
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,625
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

468
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,125
Do you know them all?

469
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:30,541
No, but everyone here pretends to
know one another. Just keep smiling.

470
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,541
After you, Mademoiselle.

471
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,250
-Brut?
-Brut.

472
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,416
Thank you.

473
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,416
-Pardon me!
-Careful, sir.

474
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,083
-Where do they serve profiteroles?
-Over there.

475
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:09,250
Over there?

476
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:14,625
Now let's attend to
some business. Profiteroles!

477
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:20,791
These profiteroles are delicious.

478
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,291
Why aren't you having any?

479
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,083
Go get some before they get cold!

480
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:30,708
-Pardon me, my fault!
-No trouble at all.

481
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:57,500
Dear guests, it is my great honor
to welcome you this evening!

482
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:03,166
Our ball has never been
so lavish as it is today,

483
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,625
for which we owe gratitude

484
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:10,250
to the generosity
of Grand Duke Konstantin!

485
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:23,875
I am happy to welcome you
to our humble celebration!

486
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:30,666
I am certain that the 20th century
will be even more exciting!

487
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:38,541
And now, Count Arkady Trubetskoy will
demonstrate the fine art of figure skating

488
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:43,500
if our honored guests would kindly
vacate the center of the rink.

489
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:50,291
What a marvelous evening.

490
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,333
Which one of them?

491
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,375
Think larger, my friend.

492
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,000
I beg your pardon.

493
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,666
My skates are a bit too small.

494
00:45:55,375 --> 00:46:01,041
When there's no war, officers
always have plenty of creative energy.

495
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,500
This is so beautiful.

496
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,500
What a leap!

497
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,291
Thank you for this.

498
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,833
Count, I must say
I'm not a very good skater.

499
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:15,666
You just relax, Alice,
I'll do everything for you.

500
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:25,375
-Alice, may I be frank with you?
-Yes.

501
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:29,583
All my life
I've felt that I'm missing something.

502
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:36,291
I always felt a strange,
almost mystical emptiness in my heart.

503
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,375
That's something to discuss
with your doctor, not me.

504
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:40,625
A witty response.

505
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,666
While I'm young, strong and single,
I cherish the ice skating thrill.

506
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,875
A winter's chill, so pure and simple,
does better than a doctor's skill.

507
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,541
Ever since I first saw you,

508
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,166
I haven't been
able to imagine my life without you.

509
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,583
Count, we've never even talked before.

510
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,083
I don't know you at all.

511
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,791
Arkady, I'm sorry to interrupt,

512
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,708
but we have a situation
that requires your attention.

513
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,625
I'll be with you in a moment.

514
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,083
The situation is very serious.

515
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:19,916
Alice, you must excuse me.
I'll accompany you to Miss Jackson.

516
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,916
No need, Count.
I'll stay here and practice a little.

517
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,041
Of course.

518
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,875
I always carry my watch
with me, in my right pocket…

519
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:37,583
-Count Trubetskoy, at your service.
-So, what happened is…

520
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,791
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

521
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:49,916
It's you!

522
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,583
It's me.

523
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:55,416
That was just a stupid dare.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

524
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,833
A dare?

525
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,791
Your ideas
about anatomy are quite peculiar.

526
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,458
I'm talking about
your "artwork" on my balcony.

527
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,208
But… that's how I see it.

528
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,041
You look very different today.

529
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,666
We're living in the time of change.

530
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,291
I can't find my wallet.

531
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:18,291
It was in my pocket a minute ago!

532
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:24,125
This is a misunderstanding.
I think I have to go now.

533
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,291
Wait.

534
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,291
I have an idea.
I won't turn you in if you do me a favor.

535
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,125
-I'll tell the orchestra.
-13 Solyanoy Lane.

536
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:39,416
-Be there tomorrow at midday.
-Are you blackmailing me?

537
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:41,625
Well, yes.

538
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a bit of a situation here.

539
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:50,875
If you think you've lost something,
please come to the rotunda…

540
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:56,333
Your Nobleness, we don't want to
be late to dinner at our grandmother's.

541
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:59,041
Dear guests,
if you see anyone suspicious…

542
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,833
Do we have a deal?

543
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:04,166
…please tell Count Trubetsky.

544
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,375
Arkady!

545
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:10,083
Why did the orchestra stop playing?

546
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,708
I'll tell them to resume.

547
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,125
Gentlemen, what's the commotion?

548
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,208
Have you seen
a small white dog around here?

549
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:23,291
The Duchess lost her dog on the rink.

550
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,708
-Close the gate, don't let it out!
-Close it, now!

551
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,583
-A dog?
-Has anyone left just now?

552
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:30,291
Who were you flirting with?

553
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,291
No, Your Nobleness!

554
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,375
Have you, by any chance,
fallen for a member of the enemy class?

555
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,458
Don't ever forget who you are
and where you come from.

556
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,375
Come on.

557
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:09,583
-Dear Countess, sorry about your loss!
-Grand Duke, you dropped your watch!

558
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,541
Tonight, we celebrate!

559
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,166
Dad, you're still up?

560
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,291
Could you sharpen these
for me, for tomorrow?

561
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,666
-You got new skates?
-These are for work.

562
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,458
Why don't you use yours?

563
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,833
Let them have some rest.

564
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:20,875
We're not allowed to use old…
I mean, antique skates.

565
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,708
For safety reasons.

566
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:26,583
-Our boss is very strict about that.
-Where were you all night?

567
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,541
What's this you're wearing? Are you drunk?

568
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:33,375
Dad… Look at this instead.

569
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:37,666
That's not all of it. Here's more.

570
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,958
Look. Here.

571
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:43,791
Here's more.

572
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:46,666
Here.

573
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:52,000
We need to hide it. Where's our box?

574
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,541
Matvey…

575
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:02,458
Nothing good will ever come
of money gained in a dishonest way.

576
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,208
What does honest or dishonest
have to do with anything?

577
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:08,000
Honesty is only
for those who can afford it.

578
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:13,208
Matvey, you have to give
all of this money back

579
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,666
before it's too late.
Promise you will do that, Matvey.

580
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,791
No, I won't give it back.
We need this money.

581
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,916
For your treatment.

582
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:28,750
The doctor said we must
take you to a clinic in Germany.

583
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,916
Son, you don't understand.

584
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,791
I know you want to save my life,
but I want to save your soul.

585
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:40,291
What if there is no soul and no afterlife?

586
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,208
Don't say that. God is listening.

587
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:45,791
What if there is no God either?

588
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,333
Go!

589
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:35,041
Faster! Keep up the pace!

590
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:37,833
Posture!

591
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:42,875
Well done!

592
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,333
Continue without me.

593
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:14,083
I present to you the speed skating
gendarme squad in training.

594
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:20,375
Do I understand correctly, Count,
that you thought of this long ago?

595
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:24,916
Your Excellency, we received
direct orders from the ministry

596
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,583
to put all our resources
into fighting political crimes.

597
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:33,208
Last night, the Grand Duke
was robbed on the Imperial rink.

598
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:38,333
He lost a priceless family heirloom.
His grandfather's watch.

599
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:42,791
I hope I needn't remind you
who his grandfather was?

600
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,750
I know very well who he was.

601
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:49,083
I am convinced that it's the work
of the same gang of skater thieves.

602
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:55,375
Theft of the royal family's property
can be equated to terrorism.

603
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,708
When will your squad be ready for duty?

604
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,666
We will begin patrolling
the canals tomorrow.

605
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,333
Excellent.

606
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:07,875
See, Your Excellency,
the wooden clubs came in handy after all.

607
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,375
Attention!

608
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,666
Did you sleep well?

609
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,666
I hope we didn't keep you awake.

610
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,833
How come you're here so early?

611
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:43,541
Alex… can I live here for a while?

612
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,666
You can live here
as long as you like. Come.

613
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,708
Rise and shine, comrades!
We've all had enough rest!

614
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,208
Leave your jacket here.

615
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:22,041
Here's half of the total sum.

616
00:57:22,666 --> 00:57:26,875
Could you please telephone
that clinic, speak with Dr. Tyshler

617
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,458
and arrange everything?
I'll bring the other half soon.

618
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,958
Nurse, take this money,
it's for Professor Tyshler.

619
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:37,583
I'll telephone him, but you must hurry.

620
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,000
-Give me a ruble.
-I'm not a bank.

621
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,000
Hey, where are you going?

622
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,458
Wait for me here.

623
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:44,708
-You came!
-As promised.

624
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:45,791
Let's go.

625
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,416
-In here?
-Yes, hurry.

626
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,750
-What is this place?
-Read the sign.

627
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:52,791
HIGHER COURSES
FOR WOMEN

628
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:53,958
But I…

629
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,041
-Do you need me to steal something?
-No.

630
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,208
Pretend to be my husband.

631
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:09,750
Next! Vyazemskaya!

632
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,375
-Is it you?
-Yes.

633
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:16,750
Come in. And you wait here, sir.

634
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:35,458
And thus, this formula
completes the chemical equation.

635
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
My friends,

636
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:48,125
I'm terribly sorry for being late.
I came here straight from the station.

637
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:52,791
I wouldn't be so distressed if it
were my fault, but it was the train's.

638
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:53,708
As usual…

639
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,250
I can tell you're not angry with me,
so let's continue.

640
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,500
Typical Mendeleev.

641
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,916
Now, what do we, or, rather,
who do we have here?

642
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:06,166
Mademoiselle, allow me to
introduce myself. Dmitri Mendeleev.

643
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:08,750
And what is your name?

644
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,083
-Alice.
-Alice.

645
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,791
Charming. Well?

646
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,625
It's such a surprise
to meet you here, Mr. Mendeleev.

647
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:18,208
Your Foundations of Chemistry
is my bedside book.

648
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,750
Is that right? Let's check and see.

649
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:23,541
Allow me…

650
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:26,208
-Well, the beginning is good.
-Thank you.

651
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:27,833
Very nice.

652
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,000
Tell me, fair young ladies, la, la, la…

653
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,458
You know what? This is quite
a bold approach. Well done.

654
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:40,291
Colleagues… I've seen enough.

655
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,625
We're signing her up.

656
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,750
Not so fast, Mr. Mendeleev.

657
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:50,458
I trust you have permission from your
father or your husband to study here?

658
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:54,083
Of course. My husband is here.

659
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:56,041
Please invite him in.

660
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:02,041
I really am delighted
to see how bold your solution is.

661
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,000
Here's her husband.

662
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,916
Me. Yes. Husband.

663
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,291
-Fully agree with everything.
-There you go.

664
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,833
Won't stop nagging me. My wife.

665
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:24,583
"I want to marry… I mean, study…
at the higher curses." I mean, courses.

666
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,375
-Courses.
-There you go.

667
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:32,458
-Her husband agrees.
-Yes.

668
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,708
So, colleagues, we sign her up.

669
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:40,041
Not yet, Mr. Mendeleev.
Sir, have you written your statement?

670
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,333
-No.
-Well then, write it here and now.

671
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,541
Please give him a sheet of paper.

672
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:56,291
Go on, young man, write it.
What are you waiting for?

673
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,708
-Don't be shy.
-Over here.

674
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:00,750
Well?

675
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,625
In your own words.

676
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:06,791
Please.

677
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,500
Do us an honor.

678
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,083
I see.

679
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:19,458
Where was your wedding? What church?

680
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,375
-Vladimirsky.
-Andreevsky.

681
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,125
Next.

682
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:33,041
Ask your father to give you permission.

683
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:36,333
What a splendid idea!
How did I not think of that? Thank you.

684
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,500
You're welcome.

685
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,791
It's called sarcasm,
in case you've never heard of it.

686
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,208
You don't know my father.

687
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:52,875
His views on education
for women are different from mine.

688
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:56,958
But if you'd passed
and they'd signed you up, then what?

689
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:58,833
He would've found out anyway.

690
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,541
I was prepared to leave home.

691
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,583
Everything depended on today's exam.

692
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,541
How was I to know?

693
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:15,041
You didn't tell me I'd have to
write things and answer questions.

694
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,666
I thought, in your line of work,
you'd be skilled in the art of lying.

695
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,208
Give me your hand.

696
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,666
-Thank you.
-What is this?

697
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,916
-For your time.
-I didn't come for this.

698
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:30,916
Take them back.

699
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:33,625
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

700
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:36,500
Just imagine you took it
from me without me noticing.

701
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,833
Take me back.

702
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:40,041
You know, the usual way.

703
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,083
You know nothing about me!

704
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:55,458
You grew up in a huge mansion,
and I was born in a ditch.

705
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:56,375
What?

706
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,875
I can't read or write,
I steal from the rich,

707
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:02,708
but your kind has always been
stealing from the poor. Sorry.

708
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:06,208
-I've never stolen from anyone!
-You've never had to.

709
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,708
Your ancestors did it all for you.
Who built your mansion?

710
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:12,083
My grandfather.

711
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,375
And how many bondslaves
did your grandfather own?

712
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,083
A thousand? Two thousand?

713
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:20,708
Ten thousand.

714
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,583
Giddyap!

715
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,583
I didn't mean to offend you.

716
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,041
You're right.

717
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:42,083
I don't know how poor people…
I mean, ordinary people live.

718
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:47,000
Why do you want to study? What for?

719
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,708
Isn't it obvious?

720
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:53,416
Scientists can use their knowledge
to make the world a better place.

721
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,708
They can cure incurable diseases

722
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,833
and make life better
for everyone, not just the rich.

723
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:00,708
You see?

724
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,166
We've arrived.

725
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,583
I don't even know your name.

726
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:22,000
Alice Maria Augusta
von Schlessenburg-Vyazemskaya.

727
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,250
And your name?

728
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:28,125
Matvey. Simply Matvey.

729
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,750
Still, I must reward you
for your time somehow.

730
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,083
I'd rather you…

731
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,583
come with me.

732
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:44,083
I don't mean right now. Tonight.

733
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:46,750
We can go for a walk
and a skate along the canals.

734
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,166
I'll show you the city
like you've never seen it before.

735
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:52,625
Matvey, are you
inviting me on a secret date?

736
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,083
Yes.

737
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,125
You know what?

738
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,541
I meant to say, on a city tour.

739
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,083
Give me my coat.

740
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,708
You can't go any further.

741
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:14,208
-And the fare?
-In a moment.

742
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,833
So what do you say?

743
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,208
Maybe one day.

744
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,958
Merry Christmas to you,
kind man! Thank you!

745
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:43,500
May luck be always on your side,
and a pretty woman at your side!

746
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,666
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you too.

747
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,041
How about a cup of tea?

748
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:13,958
-Here's your tip.
-Thank you, sir.

749
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:15,750
Make way!

750
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:19,458
-Watch where you're going!
-I'm very sorry.

751
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,000
And this.

752
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:34,208
I don't know what I love more,

753
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:39,125
your generosity or your wisdom.

754
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:43,875
I figured there's no such thing
as too many diamonds.

755
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:49,208
Alice…

756
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,500
don't you want to
try on your new necklace?

757
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,375
Trust me, dear daughter,

758
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,166
yours is no less luxurious.

759
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,791
Beautiful.

760
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:12,833
-Thank you.
-It suits you marvelously.

761
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:14,875
Yes, it's very pretty.

762
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,083
As for your present, we'll have to go…

763
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,500
-Where?
-Outside.

764
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:23,333
I'm not looking.

765
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,375
Voilà!

766
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,458
A horseless carriage.

767
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,750
There are only
three of them in St. Petersburg.

768
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:36,750
One belongs to the Tsar,
one to Ryabushinsky, the banker,

769
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:42,625
and the third belongs to
my wonderful beloved husband.

770
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:45,541
You're amazing.

771
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,666
How far will this thing go?
As far as the first pothole?

772
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:56,708
Right. We'll learn to fly
before we learn to fix our roads.

773
01:08:56,791 --> 01:09:02,875
Fyodor, potholes are our
country's strategic advantage.

774
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:07,458
While our roads are bad,
we're invincible. So, how does it work?

775
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:13,875
Very simple. You press
this pedal and steer as you wish.

776
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:18,625
And this pedal here
is for stopping. And that's it.

777
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,916
Let's see…

778
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,500
-It's not moving! Which pedal?
-The right one.

779
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:28,375
Off it goes!

780
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:30,875
Careful!

781
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,208
A very curious toy indeed.

782
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:38,750
Sir, this is no toy.

783
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,291
It has the power of ten horses.

784
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,958
And none of the droppings.

785
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:48,291
-And now, my present for Alice.
-Get it, quick!

786
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:58,125
A cozy little house for your furry friend.

787
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,666
Thank you.

788
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:09,416
I have a splendid idea, let's go to
the Christmas mass in the locomobile.

789
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,916
Wonderful idea! Right, Alice?

790
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:17,583
I'm still not feeling well.

791
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:20,458
I'd rather stay home tonight.

792
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:42,666
What are you doing here?

793
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:47,708
It's Christmas Eve.
I have a small present for you.

794
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:50,041
Someone might see you!

795
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,416
I promised you a night city tour.

796
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,750
-Matvey, are you insane?
-Step aside.

797
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:02,541
I can't leave the house without
permission, especially at this hour.

798
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,666
-I'll help you.
-Matvey…

799
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,958
Everything's fine.

800
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,208
-I can do it myself.
-Leave it to me.

801
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:20,208
I'm a bad skater, as you know.

802
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,375
We'll sort that out.

803
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:28,000
Good. Now a bit faster.

804
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:31,958
I can't do it.

805
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:36,833
Nonsense. Just stop
thinking about it and you'll be fine.

806
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:45,541
-Let's do it together. One…
-One…

807
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:46,625
-Two…
-Two…

808
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:47,708
One…

809
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,916
Hold onto me, and don't look down.

810
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,625
One, two. One, two.

811
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:58,208
Forget about everything, and look forward.

812
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:01,125
That's it.

813
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,875
Ahead of us is the Lions Bridge.

814
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,041
When you pass under it,
make a wish and it'll come true.

815
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,666
See the street lamps?
My father lights them all.

816
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:30,458
-Really?
-Yes.

817
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:44,375
-Don't be scared.
-What's ahead?

818
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:45,541
Don't be scared.

819
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,500
Now look.

820
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,333
Look at those antlers.

821
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:14,666
CHINISELLE CIRCUS

822
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:18,916
May I?

823
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,375
-What's he got there?
-Cover me.

824
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,458
Where?

825
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:36,250
It's just flour.

826
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:42,458
I get it! Dispersion helps increase
reaction volume. You know?

827
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:43,583
No.

828
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,333
Enjoy, it's delicious.

829
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:48,625
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

830
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,333
-How do I…
-Just bite it.

831
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,500
Listen, let's go look at the wrestlers.

832
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:59,916
-But what about the swing?
-We'll be back.

833
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,000
Matvey!

834
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,166
What a nice surprise.

835
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,500
Alex, Margot, this is Alice.

836
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:14,791
-Good evening.
-I remember Alice.

837
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:16,791
-Alice?
-What are your plans?

838
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:18,833
-We wanted to…
-May I?

839
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:21,958
Take a walk together? How boring.

840
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:51,041
Quantity leads to quality.

841
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:54,916
It takes time to heat up water,
but it boils in an instant.

842
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:58,500
You won't even notice
when everyone here starts to boil

843
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:01,458
and the whole empire
goes up in a cloud of steam.

844
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:07,333
Are you suggesting that,
in order to achieve social justice,

845
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,250
most people
must give up all their property?

846
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,208
Most people don't have
any property. The problem is,

847
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:18,125
the ruling class of usurpers must be
replaced with a people's council.

848
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:20,750
Here. Read this book.

849
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:23,291
I'm sure it'll help make sense of things.

850
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,916
It's my Christmas present to you.

851
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,583
Here's to the Christmas present!

852
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:33,541
Thank you.

853
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:35,000
DAS KAPITAL - BY KARL MARX

854
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:40,250
Let's take your example with water.
Steam is still water, still H2O.

855
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:43,000
It remains the same substance,
only its form changes.

856
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,208
Do you think
there will be any substantial change

857
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:49,875
if you just replace one usurping minority,
as you call it, with another?

858
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:55,333
See? Their unwillingness
to give up their privileges

859
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:58,791
is the reason why
peaceful change is impossible.

860
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,666
Matvey, what are your thoughts on this?

861
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:10,416
I think we need to focus on
our similarities, not our differences.

862
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,000
Why are you listening to her?

863
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,916
She's bourgeoisie.
What else would she say?

864
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:21,833
And this weasel
will agree with anything she says

865
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,875
just to get under her skirt.

866
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,875
It's clear as day!

867
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:31,541
Apologize to her.

868
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:44,666
I have a great revelation for you.

869
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:48,916
Countesses and peasant girls
are all the same…

870
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:55,250
when you turn them upside down.

871
01:16:57,916 --> 01:16:59,333
Bring it on.

872
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:12,375
Order them to stop fighting.

873
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:15,916
I can't order them around,
I can only make a suggestion.

874
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,666
So make a suggestion then!

875
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,208
-I suggest that you stop fighting!
-He messed with the wrong guy.

876
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:26,875
Why are you being so rude?
And you, cool off.

877
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:28,000
Alex!

878
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:34,208
No party is complete without a good fight!

879
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,666
Sounds like a toast to me.

880
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,333
Come here, you!

881
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,500
It'll sting a little.

882
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,666
Matvey…

883
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:57,000
Thank you.

884
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,625
I'm home in one piece,
but you're a bit broken.

885
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,458
I'll be as good as new in no time.

886
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:19,041
Matvey, I wish this night
would never end, but…

887
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,708
But?

888
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,750
I must tell you something.

889
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,666
They're planning to marry me off.

890
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:31,625
But…

891
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,833
you really wanted to study.

892
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:39,625
Are you really
going to marry without love?

893
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:49,875
Love is nothing more
than our basic sexual instincts…

894
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:01,041
that control our behavior.

895
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,250
You should go now.

896
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,875
Goodbye.

897
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:31,541
Life is beautiful
and that calls for a celebration!

898
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:34,000
A bar, what a coincidence!

899
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:37,625
Good man, pour me a shot of caraway vodka!

900
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:42,791
Let's make it two shots,
and three would be even better!

901
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,833
You're a good man! Keep them coming!

902
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:55,458
In fact, I'll buy the whole pitcher!

903
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,416
I'm a rich man today!

904
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,875
You keep the change.

905
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,458
Thank you, sir.

906
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,166
Well, bottoms up!

907
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,708
Sir, you dropped your wallet.

908
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:15,333
My wallet? My wallet…

909
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:31,666
Marussia?

910
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:36,958
Marussia, where are you going?
Sweetie, you'll fall and hurt your knee!

911
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,708
Ladies and gentlemen!

912
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:52,166
I would like to wish you all
a merry… drunken afternoon!

913
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:13,291
Got you! You're under arrest!
You won't get away this time!

914
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:16,458
Go home.

915
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,250
I said, go home.

916
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:39,541
Now!

917
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,375
Fly!

918
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:52,750
Run!

919
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:12,916
Make way!

920
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,041
Fly, down!

921
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,583
Out of my way!

922
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,291
-Coming through!
-Make way, everyone!

923
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,041
-Spin me!
-All right!

924
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,083
Give way!

925
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:29,458
Dive under!

926
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:41,416
-Fly!
-Let's do it!

927
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:56,666
Let's split up.

928
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:58,958
Matvey!

929
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:03,250
Thank you.

930
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,625
Come here!

931
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:34,041
Thank you.

932
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:41,166
You're very lucky,
the bullet missed the bone. Careful.

933
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:45,708
I recommend avoiding
physical activity for now.

934
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:52,208
Take this, it's for the pain.

935
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:54,750
Thank you.

936
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:18,416
May I walk you to your seat?

937
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:26,000
Alice, what I wanted
to tell you at the rink--

938
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:30,541
Your attention is flattering, Count,
but my interests lie in other areas.

939
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:34,416
-I'm sure any young woman would--
-I know that.

940
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:38,208
-What?
-I know that you're different.

941
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:42,500
You're progressive and smart.
A 20th-century woman.

942
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:45,750
And trust me, our views are
more similar than you might think.

943
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:52,166
All right, what are your views
on women in higher education?

944
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:58,125
You might find it hard to believe, but…

945
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,333
I'm a liberal.

946
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:06,166
I fully support equal rights
for women, in all matters.

947
01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:08,583
Including the right to vote.

948
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,583
But we don't have elections.

949
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:15,041
Count, your seat is next to Alice's.

950
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:28,083
And now, I will need
the assistance of two people.

951
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:33,833
A man and a woman. Yin and yang.

952
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:44,416
Their energies will bring
the elements together for my next act.

953
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:51,750
Severina, do me an honor,
help choose my assistants.

954
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:18,083
I think Alice and Arkady
are perfect for this.

955
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:20,791
Tremendous!

956
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:28,041
Alice and Arkady,
please come to me with your candles.

957
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:34,958
Alice, please stand
to my left and listen carefully.

958
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:38,875
Arkady, stand to the right.

959
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:46,541
And now, you will bring
the flames of your candles

960
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:49,916
to the surface of this bowl.

961
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,708
Pay attention.
Take caution to do it simultaneously.

962
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:58,208
One!

963
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:01,291
Two!

964
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,166
Three!

965
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:12,166
Young people, I sense that
your energies are destined for one other.

966
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:17,958
If this is truly so,
this flame will not harm me.

967
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:52,083
Tremendous! Because of your energies,
the flame is doing me no harm!

968
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,916
Alice!

969
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,291
Like I said, extraordinary energy!

970
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:00,458
This effect is referred to as cold fire.

971
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:02,833
-Alice.
-To observe it, you mix…

972
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:05,125
-Please stop.
-…ethanol and boric acid…

973
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:08,333
-Alice, get off the stage.
-…and ignite the mixture.

974
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,458
-I command you.
-The vapors produce a green flame,

975
01:30:10,541 --> 01:30:12,666
cool to the touch.

976
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:16,250
It's not magic, it's chemistry.

977
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,000
I'm sure this gentleman knows

978
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:22,583
that when the alcohol
begins to burn, the flame will become hot.

979
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,916
I'm very sorry about this,
ladies and gentlemen.

980
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:46,875
Dad?

981
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:10,000
-I'd like to have a word with you…
-Father, you didn't even knock.

982
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:13,916
…about what happened.
What are you hiding? Hand it over.

983
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:39,583
It would appear that the Decembrists
failed to teach anyone anything.

984
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:48,083
All our problems stem from the fact
that we stopped beating our children.

985
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:52,916
Should I fetch a whip?
Or do you have one with you?

986
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,541
Your sarcasm is inappropriate.

987
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:56,333
They're just books.

988
01:31:56,416 --> 01:32:00,333
You have no idea
what kind of fire they can fuel!

989
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:07,375
Burn the books.

990
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,208
DAS KAPITAL

991
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,416
You, get out.

992
01:32:56,041 --> 01:33:00,541
Good. Don't worry, I'm holding you.

993
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:06,000
Look at what I'm doing
and repeat after me. Now turn.

994
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,750
Never look down, Matvey.
Always look forward.

995
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:17,125
Now try without my help. On you go.

996
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:25,041
Well done.

997
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:30,125
-Dad, I can skate. Look!
-Well done, Matvey!

998
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:32,166
Don't look down.

999
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:34,916
Always look forward.

1000
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:45,791
Dad?

1001
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:50,208
Dad?

1002
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:19,416
Nothing good will ever come
of money gained in a dishonest way.

1003
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,000
You have to give all of this money back.
Promise you will do that, Matvey.

1004
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,000
I promise.

1005
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,125
Keep it.

1006
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,958
I can't. I made a promise.

1007
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,958
Where's Duke?

1008
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:51,625
He'll be back.

1009
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:56,041
Is that your final decision, Matvey?

1010
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,333
Then why did you even come here?

1011
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:07,416
I wanted to tell you in person.

1012
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:30,000
An oath to your father is sacred.

1013
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,041
You can't break it.

1014
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:06,375
What?

1015
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,916
Stop!

1016
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:13,041
I said stop!

1017
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:18,833
Fyodor!

1018
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:30,000
Is that a woman behind the wheel?

1019
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:34,500
Give me your sweet caress!

1020
01:38:34,583 --> 01:38:39,666
Let's make our life a dream…

1021
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:43,041
Don't worry about Duke.

1022
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:47,333
I'm sure he just went to see
his girl, he'll be back by morning.

1023
01:38:47,916 --> 01:38:49,375
Duke would never…

1024
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,875
She was looking for you in the bar.

1025
01:38:59,375 --> 01:39:00,500
Alice?

1026
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:03,708
I left home.

1027
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:08,166
I'm going to Paris, to study at
the best chemistry school in the world.

1028
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:09,708
Matvey, I brought my jewelry.

1029
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:13,208
It's enough to pay for the tickets
and for your father's treatment.

1030
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:42,041
There. You'll be warm all night.

1031
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:50,750
This room isn't very cozy,
but I hope you get a good night's sleep.

1032
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:51,833
Yes.

1033
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:57,333
I'm glad you
paid me a visit that one time.

1034
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:06,708
-Where will you sleep?
-Downstairs. This is Alex's room.

1035
01:40:09,416 --> 01:40:11,666
In the morning,
you and I will go to the train station

1036
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,625
and find out about
the next train to Paris.

1037
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:16,541
Good night.

1038
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:18,958
Good night.

1039
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:23,916
Matvey…

1040
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:43,041
Tell me…

1041
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:47,708
What would you say
if I asked you to come to Paris with me?

1042
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:47,291
Say something to me in French.

1043
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:50,875
The first thing that comes to mind.

1044
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:55,625
I love you.

1045
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:01,166
What does that mean?

1046
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:03,875
Gentlemen!

1047
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:09,750
We have you surrounded!
Resistance is futile!

1048
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:13,833
Come out one by one with your hands up,

1049
01:42:13,916 --> 01:42:16,916
or we'll be forced
to take drastic measures!

1050
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,125
It's the gendarmes.

1051
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:19,791
You have 30 seconds!

1052
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:37,458
Your time is up, gentlemen!

1053
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:42,458
Do it!

1054
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,125
They set the ship on fire!

1055
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,125
We're surrounded!

1056
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:07,875
They're everywhere!

1057
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:18,875
It's the gendarmes!

1058
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:21,875
You're just in time for a chat.

1059
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:26,166
Alice, remember you said you'd give up
your privileges for the sake of commoners?

1060
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,541
Alex, leave her out of this.

1061
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:30,500
She won't get hurt.
We'll just trade her for our freedom.

1062
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:33,416
-Alex, I can't breathe!
-We're leaving soon, dear.

1063
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,833
We have no time for your chivalry!

1064
01:43:37,208 --> 01:43:39,083
Alex!

1065
01:43:47,458 --> 01:43:49,458
-You go.
-What about you?

1066
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:50,958
Go. I know what I'm doing.

1067
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:55,458
Over here!

1068
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:02,875
Give me your hand!

1069
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:08,000
-Go!
-Come on!

1070
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:13,166
Stop! That way.

1071
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:23,375
-Got you, bastard!
-Grab the girl!

1072
01:44:25,166 --> 01:44:26,458
Let go of me!

1073
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:33,250
This side is safer. Climb down,
like that time from the balcony.

1074
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:42,875
Let me go! Bastards!

1075
01:44:46,833 --> 01:44:50,375
-What about you, Matvey?
-I'll be right behind you.

1076
01:45:03,708 --> 01:45:05,041
No need to rush.

1077
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:08,500
I'll repeat myself,
never forget who you are…

1078
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:10,166
-Alex…
-Look!

1079
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:12,708
No!

1080
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:14,208
And where you come from.

1081
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,208
He survived.

1082
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,250
Is that all of them?

1083
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:33,500
I have a hostage here!

1084
01:45:35,625 --> 01:45:36,583
A noblewoman!

1085
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,166
The minister's daughter.

1086
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:45,541
Her name is Alice.

1087
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:48,541
Is he bluffing?

1088
01:45:52,708 --> 01:45:54,000
Don't shoot!

1089
01:45:56,375 --> 01:45:59,583
Let her go!
She has nothing to do with this.

1090
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:02,583
First, let all of
my friends go, and then we'll talk.

1091
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:19,791
You'd better hurry,
or you'll have no young lady to save.

1092
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:24,500
Get them to their feet.

1093
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:29,208
Him as well.

1094
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:31,333
But he's a traitor!

1095
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:35,166
Yes, but he's our traitor.
Look at how they… damaged him.

1096
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:39,583
Now it's your turn!

1097
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:42,583
I need a guarantee
that you will let them go.

1098
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:47,083
An officer's word.

1099
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:02,458
You're free to go.

1100
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,500
Hold on to the rope.

1101
01:47:30,666 --> 01:47:31,583
Catch her.

1102
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:18,666
Matvey!

1103
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,375
Go on, hit me again
if that's going to make you feel better.

1104
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:31,708
-Should we let the bandits get away?
-No, arrest them.

1105
01:48:31,791 --> 01:48:33,458
-Seize them!
-Catch them!

1106
01:48:33,541 --> 01:48:35,750
Listen, she will be just fine.

1107
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:39,375
"Fine"? I'll never see her again.

1108
01:48:39,458 --> 01:48:42,000
I was talking about her, not you.

1109
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,166
So this is what
an officer's word is worth these days.

1110
01:48:57,041 --> 01:48:58,958
Did you really think you two had a chance?

1111
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:04,208
My friend, never in the history of
this country would you two be together.

1112
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:08,041
We love each other, and this
country has nothing to do with it.

1113
01:49:09,791 --> 01:49:11,291
That sure has a ring to it.

1114
01:49:13,916 --> 01:49:16,416
It's time for you to go.
The fire melted the ice.

1115
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:21,500
Take a running leap.

1116
01:49:26,958 --> 01:49:27,958
And you?

1117
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:33,125
The captain
is always last to leave the ship.

1118
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:46,958
See you on the other side.

1119
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:52,708
What's going on up there?

1120
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:16,500
Got him.

1121
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,000
No!

1122
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,750
Your daughter
is deeply sorry for what happened.

1123
01:51:08,833 --> 01:51:10,666
She didn't know who else to turn to.

1124
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:13,375
I am sure it won't happen again.

1125
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:18,291
Your Excellency, I hope you can
find it in yourself to forgive her.

1126
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,375
Giddyap

1127
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:34,083
Doctor, some fishermen
brought a man in from the ice.

1128
01:51:39,666 --> 01:51:40,875
Put him down right here.

1129
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:46,291
The boy was lying by the water.

1130
01:51:47,791 --> 01:51:50,791
We checked, he seems alive.

1131
01:51:52,416 --> 01:51:54,666
-Seemed…
-Heat some water.

1132
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:10,750
We have successfully liquidated
a gang of dangerous pickpockets

1133
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:12,916
who worked
the city's canals and ice rinks.

1134
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,625
The leader was a repeat offender
Alexey Tarasov, also known as "Alex."

1135
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:19,750
We found a stash
of valuables in the gang's hideout.

1136
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:23,750
I believe this watch
is the Grand Duke's family heirloom

1137
01:52:24,583 --> 01:52:27,375
that was stolen
from him on the Imperial rink.

1138
01:52:50,375 --> 01:52:51,458
Alice!

1139
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,041
Congratulations.

1140
01:52:57,333 --> 01:53:02,458
Arkady has asked
for your hand in marriage, and I agreed.

1141
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:06,041
Fyodor, champagne!

1142
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:19,083
-Countess.
-Thank you.

1143
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:22,250
Beautiful.

1144
01:53:22,333 --> 01:53:24,458
We're so happy for you!

1145
01:53:32,041 --> 01:53:37,416
We'll announce the engagement
tonight at the New Year ball.

1146
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:41,666
Congratulations.

1147
01:53:43,375 --> 01:53:44,916
This is a good omen!

1148
01:53:48,375 --> 01:53:53,166
Always look forward, son.
Got it? Now try without my help.

1149
01:53:56,791 --> 01:53:57,916
Don't look down.

1150
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:00,416
Always look forward.

1151
01:54:12,208 --> 01:54:15,000
Well, back from the dead is what you are.

1152
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:18,750
Here, Doctor.

1153
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:22,333
Matvey…

1154
01:54:28,125 --> 01:54:29,500
They brought your father here.

1155
01:54:30,416 --> 01:54:31,625
Take care of yourself.

1156
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:40,291
Just a second. Doctor!

1157
01:54:45,541 --> 01:54:46,833
Thank you for everything.

1158
01:54:58,166 --> 01:55:00,958
His Excellency
awaits you in his locomobile.

1159
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:37,916
Duke von Schlessenburg-Vyazemsky
and his spouse.

1160
01:55:38,583 --> 01:55:40,333
My friend!

1161
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:44,708
Welcome to our humble costume ball!

1162
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:46,833
Greetings, Severina.

1163
01:55:47,416 --> 01:55:52,208
To mark the occasion,
I have a small gift for you.

1164
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:59,166
My watch! You found it!

1165
01:56:00,458 --> 01:56:06,708
I will most certainly tell my nephew
Tsar Nicholas of your efforts.

1166
01:56:06,791 --> 01:56:11,916
Thank you, but this is entirely
the merit of Count Arkady Trubetskoy.

1167
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,750
I remember, the count with the ice skates!

1168
01:56:15,458 --> 01:56:19,916
Our old family legend
has it that this very watch

1169
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,458
is the only valuable Marie-Antoinette
took with her from Versailles

1170
01:56:23,541 --> 01:56:28,083
when it was stormed
by those peasants in red caps.

1171
01:56:28,625 --> 01:56:31,375
And guess where she hid this watch?

1172
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:33,250
Where? Please do tell.

1173
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:37,750
I dare not say it
in the presence of women.

1174
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:42,833
-Welcome!
-Thank you, Your Highness.

1175
01:56:42,916 --> 01:56:44,583
Count and Countess Alsufyev.

1176
01:57:00,708 --> 01:57:01,833
Hey! Who did that?

1177
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:05,208
Gather them all, quick!
To the very last one!

1178
01:57:05,916 --> 01:57:09,708
These are exotic fruits,
they cost a fortune!

1179
01:57:11,833 --> 01:57:12,958
Hurry up, you lot!

1180
01:57:48,333 --> 01:57:49,291
I'm not your enemy.

1181
01:57:50,416 --> 01:57:53,083
You'll know me better
as time passes on, and then…

1182
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:58,708
Excuse me, Count, I need to step out.

1183
01:57:59,333 --> 01:58:00,583
I'll accompany you.

1184
01:58:02,625 --> 01:58:04,500
Can't I go by myself?

1185
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:07,000
Count! Don't ignore us.

1186
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:07,958
All right.

1187
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:08,875
Count!

1188
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,958
Do me an honor, Count! Come dance with us!

1189
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:39,750
Hey, fellow, aren't you
serving drinks? We'll have some!

1190
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,083
Alice.

1191
01:59:08,916 --> 01:59:09,916
Alice.

1192
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:17,416
I bought us two tickets.

1193
01:59:18,166 --> 01:59:20,500
We can still
make it to the train to Paris.

1194
01:59:21,791 --> 01:59:22,958
What are you doing here?

1195
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:24,208
Is he bothering you?

1196
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:29,666
Get back to work. Now.

1197
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:37,125
On this joyous occasion
at the turn of a new century,

1198
01:59:37,208 --> 01:59:42,125
I would like to announce
that my family has some happy news.

1199
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:43,541
My daughter Alice

1200
01:59:43,625 --> 01:59:47,375
and Count Arkady Trubetskoy
are engaged to be married!

1201
01:59:48,166 --> 01:59:50,375
Count, where is Alice?

1202
01:59:52,208 --> 01:59:53,375
I will go fetch her.

1203
01:59:53,458 --> 01:59:55,833
The new year starts in one minute!

1204
01:59:55,916 --> 01:59:59,125
Let's count down the seconds! Sixty!

1205
02:00:00,333 --> 02:00:03,708
Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!

1206
02:00:04,666 --> 02:00:08,791
Fifty-seven! Fifty-six!

1207
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:12,166
Fifty-five! Fifty-four!

1208
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:14,583
This is where she was standing.

1209
02:00:25,125 --> 02:00:26,708
FROM: ST. PETERSBURG - TO: PARIS

1210
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:28,791
Come on.

1211
02:00:38,833 --> 02:00:41,916
Four! Three!

1212
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,166
Two! One!

1213
02:01:06,833 --> 02:01:07,916
We must hurry.

1214
02:01:35,208 --> 02:01:36,750
Attention, passengers!

1215
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:39,166
-We'll make it!
-That way!

1216
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:42,166
The Paris bound
Nord Express train is now boarding.

1217
02:01:48,125 --> 02:01:49,250
We're on time.

1218
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:53,083
Forward! Make way!

1219
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:57,000
-No horses allowed!
-Stop!

1220
02:01:57,708 --> 02:02:00,666
Count Trubetskoy, fourth division.

1221
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:07,041
These Russians… I'm telling you,
St. Petersburg changes people.

1222
02:02:18,958 --> 02:02:22,458
May I see your tickets?
Thank you. And yours?

1223
02:02:22,541 --> 02:02:24,208
-I gave you two.
-No, only one.

1224
02:02:24,291 --> 02:02:27,875
-What?
-I don't understand. I had two tickets.

1225
02:02:28,833 --> 02:02:30,458
Please let us on. We'll pay the fare.

1226
02:02:30,541 --> 02:02:33,708
Only through the ticket office.
You still have five minutes.

1227
02:02:38,666 --> 02:02:40,083
I'll go with you.

1228
02:02:44,666 --> 02:02:45,791
I'll be quick.

1229
02:02:46,583 --> 02:02:49,125
Wait for me on the train. You're tired.

1230
02:02:49,208 --> 02:02:50,458
This way please.

1231
02:02:50,541 --> 02:02:51,458
Thank you.

1232
02:02:51,541 --> 02:02:54,750
Are you traveling
to Paris without luggage?

1233
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:55,791
Yes.

1234
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,416
Don't worry, I'll be quick.

1235
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,291
Right this way please.

1236
02:03:00,666 --> 02:03:01,625
Thank you.

1237
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:05,333
Don't let her out,
even if I don't make it on time. Please.

1238
02:03:50,083 --> 02:03:51,958
-Matvey!
-Stay put, Miss!

1239
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:58,041
Stay inside, Miss, for your safety!

1240
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:10,416
Matvey!

1241
02:04:11,791 --> 02:04:13,458
Your Nobleness, let me help you.

1242
02:04:14,375 --> 02:04:15,541
Matvey!

1243
02:04:18,625 --> 02:04:20,791
Please hurry!

1244
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,166
Your Nobleness?

1245
02:04:56,625 --> 02:04:57,791
I can't see any blood.

1246
02:05:16,583 --> 02:05:19,416
-Young man, you…
-Here's the second ticket.

1247
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:23,583
Wait, are you feeling well?

1248
02:05:25,166 --> 02:05:26,041
Yes.

1249
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:30,541
What can I say.
Please proceed to your compartment.

1250
02:05:37,208 --> 02:05:40,375
These skates are… magical.

1251
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:51,833
FOUR YEARS LATER

1252
02:05:51,916 --> 02:05:53,958
-Mr. Mendeleev?
-That's me.

1253
02:05:54,583 --> 02:05:56,958
From what I understand,
my daughter has been

1254
02:05:57,041 --> 02:05:59,875
corresponding privately
with you for a few years now.

1255
02:06:09,041 --> 02:06:14,000
Well, since you
obviously are aware of that fact,

1256
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:17,500
I wouldn't risk
calling our correspondence private.

1257
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,416
-You haven't mentioned it to me.
-You needn't get up.

1258
02:06:23,458 --> 02:06:27,375
Mr. Mendeleev, as a specialist
in the field of chemistry,

1259
02:06:28,375 --> 02:06:31,166
what can you tell me about
her educational achievements?

1260
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:35,083
Me, "as a specialist." That's amusing.

1261
02:06:36,375 --> 02:06:39,875
Well, as a specialist,
I can tell you the following.

1262
02:06:40,708 --> 02:06:45,958
In these few years,
she has achieved outstanding results.

1263
02:06:46,750 --> 02:06:50,333
I can tell you more. I am convinced

1264
02:06:50,416 --> 02:06:53,625
that next year
she will be awarded her degree,

1265
02:06:53,708 --> 02:06:58,416
which is unprecedented
for a Russian female student.

1266
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:04,583
That's right. And then the world
of science will open up before her.

1267
02:07:05,291 --> 02:07:10,916
Any European university will be
delighted to have her on their staff.

1268
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:20,583
What about Russian universities?

1269
02:07:23,458 --> 02:07:29,375
Your Excellency, the Charter
forbids women from teaching here.

1270
02:07:32,166 --> 02:07:35,125
The Charter is not the Bible,
we can make changes to it.

1271
02:07:39,125 --> 02:07:42,708
I agree. Good idea, right?

1272
02:07:48,708 --> 02:07:53,583
We mix the required quantities
of boric acid and ethanol,

1273
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:59,291
add sulfuric acid which acts as
a catalyst, and ignite the mixture.

1274
02:08:01,875 --> 02:08:05,625
The vapors of triethyl borate
produce a green flame…

1275
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:09,708
that is cool to the touch. Observe.

1276
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:13,833
Beautiful, isn't it?

1277
02:08:16,166 --> 02:08:18,666
I love demonstrating this experiment.

1278
02:08:19,583 --> 02:08:22,583
I have a personal story connected to it.

1279
02:08:23,333 --> 02:08:24,333
-Professor.
-Yes?

1280
02:08:24,416 --> 02:08:27,916
-Tell us the story.
-Yes, we'd love to hear it!

1281
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,875
I promise I will, some other time.
And now let us hear the story

1282
02:08:33,958 --> 02:08:37,541
of this reaction as told
in the language of chemistry.

1283
02:08:37,625 --> 02:08:42,041
So, we mix ethanol
with boric acid and sulfuric acid…

1284
02:08:42,125 --> 02:08:44,875
Her lectures are immensely popular.

1285
02:08:44,958 --> 02:08:49,708
…triethyl borate produces
a green flame which is…

1286
02:08:49,791 --> 02:08:51,625
Cool to the touch!

1287
02:08:57,083 --> 02:08:58,458
Cool to the touch.

1288
02:09:01,458 --> 02:09:03,916
-Please be careful, promise?
-Of course.

1289
02:09:07,041 --> 02:09:08,166
Let's go.

1290
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:14,375
Good. Don't look down.
Always look forward.

1291
02:09:15,083 --> 02:09:20,291
Well done. You're doing great.
And now try without my help.

1292
02:09:27,666 --> 02:09:29,166
Look at him go.

1293
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:31,583
He takes after his father.

1294
02:09:36,708 --> 02:09:37,750
Peter, look!

1295
02:09:37,833 --> 02:09:41,458
Look at what Daddy can do.
Splendid, isn't it? Go to him.

1296
02:09:46,958 --> 02:09:50,750
My clever boy! Shall we, darling?
