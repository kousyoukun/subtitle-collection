Hey, hey. Ease up.

00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,930
You're sitting on my cloak.

12
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,600
- Filling up down below?
- Not a sausage.

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,812
- Ah. Here you are, Terry.
- Thank you.

l can't see him anywhere.

16
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,113
- Programs.
- Oh. Two, please.

17
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,283
One here. Thanks, pal.

Old Palmer's music had better be good.

20
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,502
Boronskaja would hardly be dancing
the leading role if it wasn't.

21
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,175
- Boro who?
- Who exactly is Boronskaja?

22
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,554
Since you've queued for six hours, waiting to see
her dance, l should have thought...

23
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,432
Not to see anybody. To hear.

24
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,603
TERRY: Have you ever heard of
Professor Palmer?

25
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,813
BOTH: Never.
- You will.

26
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,194
The program says,
"Heart Of Fire...music by Andrew Palmer."

27
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,990
- Our professor at the academy.
- Boro-what's-her-name had better be good.

28
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,701
She's hardly likely to be anything else.

29
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,964
- There he is. Palmer!

00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,275
- Forget it.
- That's it. Your rhapsody.

39
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,278
- lt must be an accident.
- Did you show him?

Oh, really!

53
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,169
Dear Professor Palmer, we're very proud of you.
l hope you're proud of yourself.

54
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,505
You're too kind. Monsieur Lermontov.

55
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,758
- We meet the great man at last.
- Enchanté, madame.

56
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,594
l never imagined l'd succeed
in getting you here.

57
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,180
l think l must be a very clever woman.

58
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,986
lf some fat harridan is going to sing, l must go.

59
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,698
- l can't bear amateurs.
- Neither can Lady Neston.

60
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,910
- What do you mean?
- She has a niece who dances.

61
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,370
Professionally.

62
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,044
Hello, Professor.

63
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,131
Now, please don't get up, Mr Lermontov.

64
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,219
Now, are you prepared for a surprise?

65
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,139
Do you mean a surprise or a shock?

66
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:52,103
Well, to take the plunge,
l've asked my niece to dance for us tonight.

67
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,065
- What would you call that?
- A shock.

68
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,362
Oh, well, you're certainly very candid.

69
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,072
You know, Mr Lermontov,

70
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,577
l wouldn't dream of boring you
with the performance of an amateur.

71
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,456
My niece has been dancing
leading roles for some time now.

72
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,000
The critics think very highly of her work.

73
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,837
How would you define ballet, Lady Neston?

74
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:23,176
Well...one might call it
the poetry of motion, perhaps, or...

75
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,597
One might. But for me, it is a great deal more.

76
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,183
For me, it is a religion.

77
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,310
And one doesn't really care

78
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:38,942
to see one's religion practised
in an atmosphere such as this.

79
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,152
l hope you understand.

80
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,449
Attractive brute.

81
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,410
(Gentle piano)

82
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,448
- Mmm...l'll have a champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,910
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.

84
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,668
Do you know, at parties
everybody is supposed to be very happy?

85
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,215
But perhaps you dislike them as much as l do.

86
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,553
Still, l think it might have been worse.

87
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,432
- Do you?
- lt very nearly was a great deal worse.

88
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,642
- Oh?
- Thank you.

89
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,313
We were to be treated
to a little dancing exhibition.

90
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,815
But now we're to be spared that horror.

91
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,027
Mr Lermontov, l am that horror.

92
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,531
Mmm...

93
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,368
lt's a bit late for apologies, isn't it?

94
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,454
Yes, a little late, l think.

95
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,416
l'm sorry. l'm terribly sorry.

96
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,419
But you're not sorry l didn't dance, are you?

97
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,047
- May l ask why?
- Because, my dear Miss...

98
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,673
Victoria Page.

99
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,676
My dear Miss Page,
if l accept an invitation to a party,

100
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,512
l do not expect to find myself at an audition.

101
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,144
Yes. You're quite right.

102
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,233
Why do you want to dance?

103
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,904
Why do you want to live?

104
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:54,202
Well, l don't know exactly why, but, uh...l must.

105
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,288
That's my answer, too.

106
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,251
Come with me.

107
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,712
- Where to?
- We are going to talk.

108
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,591
- But l don't want to talk to you.
- Don't worry. l'll do the talking.

109
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,812

111
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,568
What is it, Dimitri?

112
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,280
A young man called Craster.
He has been here a hundred times.

113
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,450
l have told him you are asleep
but he will not believe me.

114
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,996
Either you are a bad liar
or he's a young man of good sense.

115
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,498
Show him in and serve breakfast.

116

Mr Craster.

117
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,481
What can l do for you, Mr Craster?

118
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,109
l'm sorry to bother you, Mr Lermontov,

119
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,154
but it's a matter of very great importance to me.

120
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,697
Yes?

121
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,241
Last night l wrote you a letter, a silly letter.

122
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,036
l'd like to have it back before you read it, please.

123
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,997
l see.

124
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,294
That's the one.

125
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,674
Unfortunately, Mr Craster,
l have already read this letter.

126
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,926
Oh.

127
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,223
- Mr Lermontov, please.
- You are Professor Palmer's pupil?

128
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,227
You say you've written a string quartet
and a piano concerto.

129
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,395
Yes.

130
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,273
Very interesting.

131
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,776
Would you care to play me something?

132
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,612
Something of your own, l mean.

133
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,948
Of course, if...if you wish it.

134
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,838
This is a study l wrote for the piano.

135
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:20,431
But l'm thinking of orchestrating it
and putting it into an opera l'm working on.

136
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,429
But are you finished already?
lt was very interesting.

137
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,890
Hope l haven't ruined your breakfast.

138
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,268
By the way...

139
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,856
l need a new coach for the orchestra.
Would the idea interest you?

140
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,693
Would it...interest?

141
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,781
l shouldn't be able to pay much money.
Eight pounds a week and expenses.

142
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,202
lt would be absolutely marvellous.

143
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,747
Right. Then get some breakfast
and come over to Covent Garden.

144
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,041
Thank you.

145
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,919
And your letter, Mr Craster.

146
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,717
lf you take my advice...

147
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,055
..you'll destroy it immediately
and forget all about it.

148
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,646
The Heart Of Fire is your work, isn't it?

149
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,277
- These things mostly happen unintentionally.
- l know. That's why...

150
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,615
That's why it is worth remembering
that it is much more disheartening

151
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,742
to have to steal

152
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,120
than to be stolen from, hmm?

00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,247
Course l tried to get her.
Tried to get her twice. Ta-ta.

162
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,624
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you.

163
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,751
Oi, you'll pardon me.

164
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,836
This is the way to the stage, isn't it?

165
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,630
- Name?
- Julian Craster.

166
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,882
- What name?
- Julian Craster.

167
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,093
Not on the list.

168
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,812
- Lunch, lrina?
- Yes.

169
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,689
But l have an appointment...

170
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,858
l'm sorry, but l've got my job to look after.

171
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,028
- Good morning, George.
- Oh, bonjour, madame.

172
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,613
How is Madame George?

173
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,784
Oh, she's la très jalouse.
Very jalouse.

174
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,037
lt's that bit of a photograph
we had took together. Compris?

175
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:34,583
Oh, here you are. They've been looking
all over London for you this morning.

176
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,502
- Oh, flûte!
- That's what l said.

177
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,588
- How much longer must l wait?
- l'll send for the SM.

178
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,340
What is your name?

179
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,051
Julian Craster.

180
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,179
l have an appointment with Mr Lermontov.

181
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,390
Julian Kwis...Kweiss...

182
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,183
- Craster.
- Kwaster.

183
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,770
Well, George, if this young man
is invited by Mr Lermontov,

184
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,981
you can pass him, yes?

185
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,609
Ca va by me, madame. Ca va by me.

186
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,737
Follow me, young man.

187
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,576
- Est-ce que vous...?
- Comment?

188
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,579
- Are you a dancer?
- Yes...at night.

189
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,166
- Not very much in the morning.
- l don't know much about ballet.

190
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,461
- You are artiste?
- Yes. l'm a composer.

191
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,173
Ah! And you wish to see who?

192
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,383
Well, l'm afraid l'm not quite sure.

193
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,553
They are all there. Make your choice.

194
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:41,108
- Excuse me. Who's in charge?
- There's five or six of them that thinks they are.

195
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,780
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- Don't ask me. l'm just somebody's mother.

196
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,908
That doesn't mean much around here,
l can tell you.

197
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,499
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- ln charge of what?

198
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,087
- Mr Lermontov asked me to come.
- Why?

199
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,923
- He's engaged me.
- Not as a dancer, l hope.

200
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,257
No.

201
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,927
Allons, mes enfants! Au boulot!

202
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,471
And...

203
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,477
Well, Mr Ratov, Mr Ljubov wants it moved.

204
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,897
lt is on the plan, and there it stays.

205
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,108
Well, if you say so.

206
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,527
- Merci.
- Morning, madame.

207
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:33,285
Ah, here comes the great Boronskaja at last.

208
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,789
And today she's only 43 minutes late.

209
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,626
Am l supposed to congratulate myself on that?

210
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,506
l tell you, lrina, my patience is at an end.

211
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,050
l shall go to Lermontov and explain to him

212
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,679
how no theatre is big enough
to hold both you and me!

213
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,640
- l might as well start packing.
- Oh, there is no hurry.

214
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,476
He might choose to dispense with my services.

215
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,478
He is quite crazy enough.

216
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,691
But if we go, we go together,
Grischa, darling. Promise?

217
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,401
Coo, Buschka.

218
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,447
- Who are you?
- Victoria Page.

219
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,283
l expect Mr Lermontov
has spoken to you about me.

220
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,077
- He's invited me here...
- No, this is too much.

221
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,788
He invites them, l teach them.

222
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,416
l get rid of them, he forgets them.

223
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,376
And now, unhappy girl,

224
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:27,715
please go to the far corner of the stage,
where you'll meet five other young ladies

225
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:33,053
to whom Mr Lermontov
has also extended his hospitality.

226
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,942
Quiet, please!

227
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,073
l want to rehearse the first act of Heart Of Fire.

228
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,619
Will everybody not concerned
leave the stage, please?

229
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,955
Righto, boys, set act one. Hurry.

230
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,546
ls that so? Well, l agree.

231
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,426
Where are you going, my dear?

232
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,720
l'm going to talk to Mr Lermontov.

233
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,390
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until after the rehearsal?

234
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,143
Oh, no. You see, l know him personally.

235
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,772
Ah, well, that makes all the difference. Of course.

236
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,024
- Ratov...
- Yes, Boris?

237
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,860
Stay where you are. l'll come up.

238
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,155
(Orchestra tunes up)

239
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,623
- Good morning, Mr Lermontov.
- Good morning, Ratov.

240
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,126
We must do something about this foreground,
please.

241
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,838
The girls last night had hardly room to move.
Ljubov was right.

242
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,383
- Aha! Ljubov...
- Ljubov is always right.

243
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.

244
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:59,557
Well, well, well. Then take it away.
Take it away.

245
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,400
Well, you see, my dear,
Mr Lermontov is a very busy man.

246
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,904
Now, why don't you go and wait
over there with the others?

247
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,407
- lvan! Are you ready?
- Yes.

248
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,908
Yes, l will.

249
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,286
- Sergei Sergeyevich.
- Yes?

250
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:24,123
Are you acquainted with the works or person
of Julian Craster,

251
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,791
composer and conductor?

252
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,918
- No.
- Nor l.

253
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,838
Which proves how sadly
we lag behind the times,

254
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,840
for here he is in our midst.

255
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,593
Lermontov has engaged him this morning.

256
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,836
Rond de jambe...E.

257
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,277
Class dismissed.

258
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,587
(Wind instruments playing)

259
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,094
(Julian sings notes rhythmically)

260
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,934
(Julian sings tune)

261
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,313
No, gentlemen. Figure 29, sing.

262
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,317
(Julian sings tune)
- l think that will do.

263
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,403
Thank you, gentlemen.

264
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,907
The brass could do with your attention, Craster.
Tomorrow.

265
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,960
(Orchestra tunes up)

266
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,551
Gentlemen, l'm very sorry
to bring you here so early in the morning.

267
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,055
But l've been in front
for this particular ballet more than once

268
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,724
and l really must...

269
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,897
There are one or two things
l really must put right.

270
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,735
So, um, Heart Of Fire. Overture, please.

271
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,822
From the beginning.

272
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,786
Oh, by the way, trumpets...
at two bars before figure two,

273
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,873
have you got an E natural?

274
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,583
No. l've got an E flat.

275
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,295
Ah. Makes all the difference.
Should be E natural.

276
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,589
Right. From the beginning.

277
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:36,273
l know it's hard to get your lips set this early,
but we ought to be able to come in together.

278
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,485
Even more pianissimo. Less strings.

279
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,403
A oboe.

280
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,655
(All tune up)

281
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,829
From the beginning, please.

282
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,860
- That's nice.
- Mr Craster!

283
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:28,408
Precisely what is going on?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

284
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:33,205
Do you realise that by calling the orchestra early
we shall have to pay them?

285
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,292
And why are you rehearsing Heart Of Fire?

286
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,046
Did l ever ask you to do that?
Tell me. l'm interested.

287
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,508
l'm sure Mr Lermontov will be interested, too.

288
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,929
- Well?
- l like it.

289
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:54,101
You like it? l've no doubt you also like
the National Anthem and the Marseillaise.

290
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,145
l hope you won't summon
the full orchestra at dawn

291
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,314
to practise those noble melodies?

292
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,858
(Laughter)

293
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,235
l leave this young man to you, Lermontov.

294
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:08,156
After all, he is your discovery, not mine.

295
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,368
Mr Craster, l must ask you to exercise in future

296
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,705
a little more control over your natural ambitions.

297
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,293
And why you've chosen Heart Of Fire
for this early-morning escapade...

298
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,128
Good morning, gentlemen...

299
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,131
..is a mystery that l shall never hope to solve.

300
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,467
May l see that wrong note in the score, please?

301
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,141
Hmm. However,
there are passages in Heart Of Fire

302
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,978
which no-one need be ashamed of.

303
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,980
Thank you, Mr Lermontov.

304
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,912
- Good morning, Miss Page.
- Good morning, Edmund.

305
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,581
- ls Lord Oldham with you?
- Yes, miss.

306
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,791
Be careful, miss.

307
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,837
- Good morning, Peter.
- Hello, Vicky.

308
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,089
- What are you doing here?
- What are you?

309
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,885
l'm having lunch with Boris Lermontov,
the fellow who runs the ballet.

310
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,013
- Oh. Business or pleasure?
- A bit of both.

311
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,973
Are you shopping or slumming?

312
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:19,353
Don't worry, Grischa.
l'll bring her back at three o'clock.

313
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,981
- How are you, madame?
- How are you?

314
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,193

Can we give you a lift anywhere?

- No, thank you, Peter.
- Excuse me, Miss Page.

Who? Victoria Page?
Erm...yes, she may dance.

As you know, the ballet's

please don't be discouraged.

- Well, what?

Miss Page...

444
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:07,860
..l've asked you to come here tonight
because we are preparing a new ballet,

445
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:13,449
and l've decided to give you a chance
and let you dance the principal part in it.

446
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,745
But there's one thing l must tell you at once.

447
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:22,625
My belief in your possibilities
is not shared by my colleagues here.

448
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,632
However, it is hardly necessary for me to add

449
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,136
that whatever their personal belief may be,
they will all give you their best.

450

The rest, of course, is up to you.

Well, Miss Page...that's all.

Yes, l will.

455

Well, what happened?

458
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,844
- l've got a part in a new ballet.
- A new ballet? What ballet?

459
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,680
(Piano plays)
- The Red Shoes!

460
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,936
Now, listen to this. lt's impossible.

461

Well, l couldn't rewrite that bit, could l?

00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,027
- Why not?
- You didn't blue-pencil it.

Horrors like that speak for themselves.

As a matter of fact,
l did have some ideas about that.

465

Where are they, my dear fellow?
We need a score!

00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:51,714
Get rid of this sentimental hymn tune
and take a four-square chorale.

469
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,758
Something like this.

470
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,311
Then l thought all the way through,
we might have a church bell coming in.

471
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,449
All this on the strings.
(Sings tune)

472
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,538
Then as the priest appears, the brass.

473
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,791
(Sings tune with deeper voice)

474
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,008
Shall l play you The Dance Of The Red Shoes?

475
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,184
Thank you, Mr Craster. Thank you.

476
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,608
l want you to change everything.
l want a new score.

477
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,403
There you are, Mr Lermontov.

478
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,532
And where's the orchestration?

479
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,034
- When do you want it?
- Yesterday.

480
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,537
You said you wanted to work.
Go home and work.

481
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,831
l don't want to see you till it's done.

482
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,958
You won't!

483
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,128
(Band plays slow dance tune)

484
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,984
(Sternly) Why aren't you in bed?

485
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,696
- Oh, you gave me quite a fright.
- l meant to.

486
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,994
Why aren't you in bed?

487
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,956
l was ordered to but l was much too excited
to sleep, so here l am.

488
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,667
- Are you? l haven't seen you.
- Thank you.

489
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,170
By the way, you haven't seen me, either.

490
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,756
- Has he sent you to bed, too?
- No.

491
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:02,094
l'm just working on the score
of my new ballet - The Red Shoes.

492
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,138
ls that my ballet, too?

493
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,891
Yes, l suppose it is.

494
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,603
(Train whistle toots)

495
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,524
(Steam train chugs)

496
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,619
l wonder what it feels like
to wake up in the morning

497
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,245
and find oneself famous.

498
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:32,291
You're not likely to know
if you stay here talking much longer.

499
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,170
- So, good luck.
- Good luck.

500
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,009
(He whistles a slow tune)

501
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,084
(Gentle piano music)

502
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,682
She's putting too much into it.

503
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,934
Why don't you tell her, Grischa?

504
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,769
Mind your own business.

505
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:38,524
She has the dance with me
and the dance at the fair before this.

506
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,820
And the big stuff still to come.
She can't dance everything full out.

507
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,573
- She ought to know that.
- How do you expect her to know it,

508
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,994
if you never dance full out yourself
before opening night?

509
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,336
Here are the designs for the costumes, Boris.

510
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,131
One moment.
Sit down, will you, please?

511
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:09,096
l'm so sorry.
Something has to be done about the music.

512
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,307
She starts the pirouette a beat too early.

513
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,102
- The tempo's wrong. lt's too fast.
- lt's the right tempo.

514
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,645
Of course.

515
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,355
Once more.

516
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,198
- She'll be all right.
- l hope so.

517
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,368
Still unconverted, Sergei?

518
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:35,331
Well, of course she's a charming girl, but...

519
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,708
l know nothing about her charms.

520
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,086
But they won't wait till the end,
they'll applaud in the middle!

521
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,881
(Chuckles) Come now.

522
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,883
Sergei, l'll take a bet.

523
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,968
Oh, enough. Enough.

524
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:54,725
Miss Page, we are trying to create
something of beauty.

525
00:55:54,893 --> 00:56:00,356
While you wave your arms like a scarecrow
and bend your knees like an old cart horse,

526
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,733
we are unlikely to succeed.

527
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,531
Well, well...it's a bet.

528
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,701
Come on, let me see your sketches.

529
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,247
The girl. (Chuckles)

530
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,960
Renée? Rendez-vous à 14 h.

531
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,097
N'y fais pas attention, mon petit.

532
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,349
Ce Ljubov est un animal.

533
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:45,067
- Un verre d'eau, s'il vous plaît.
- Bien. Vous l'aurez dans une seconde.

534
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,319
(Gentle piano music)

535
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,746
- You still think l can do it?
- (Chuckles)

536
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,417
Well, at the moment,
you look as if you find it difficult.

537
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:05,671
But when we open in two weeks' time
l hope it'll be supremely simple.

538
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,384
Don't forget, the great impression of simplicity

539
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:14,555
can only be achieved
by a great agony of body and spirit.

540
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,099
- Voilà.
- Uh-uh-uh!

541
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,145
You don't want to ruin your breathing, do you?

542
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,816
From today, you'll lunch in my office.

543
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,068
Craster.

544
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,157
Personne ne me dit rien, donc... Voilà...

545
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,702
- Will you sit over there, please?
- Je comprends pas.

546
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,829
Merci. Mr Craster, at the piano.

547
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,124
Do you usually have
a musical accompaniment to your meals?

548
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,084
No, Miss Page, l do not.

549
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,254
But l'm afraid this is your fate
for the next two weeks.

550
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,132
Mr Craster
is going to play The Red Shoes music for you

551
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,219
at every lunch, tea and dinner you take
until we open.

552
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,180
l see.

553
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:00,225
Yes. ln this way, you should become
quite familiar with the music.

554
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,270
Yes, l think l probably shall.

555
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,607
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

556
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,901
- Mr Craster?
- Certainly.

557
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,153
Bon appétit.

558
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,658
A votre service, mademoiselle.

559
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,333
Some composers specialise
in lunchtime music, don't they?

560
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,377
- Some.
- You?

561
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,714
ln my time.

562
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,806
Do you mind not playing that?

563
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,769
lt's the right tempo.

564
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,605
Let's take the ballroom scene.

565
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,483
That's the most digestible part of the score.

566
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,985
The ballroom's out. lt's been cut.

567
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:55,906
Cut as a scene, but it's still there in my score.

568
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,243
l wrote this dance for a ballroom.

569
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:03,288
Anyone who understands anything about music
will see a ballroom.

570
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:17,344
Even Lermontov will see a ballroom.
(Stops playing) Even you.

571
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,889
(Starts playing) And when you're lifted
up into the air by your partner,

572
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,517
my music will transform you.

573
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,769
lnto what?

574
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,481
A flower...swaying in the wind.

575
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,278
A cloud...drifting in the sky.

576
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,614
A white bird...flying.

577
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,492
Tell that to Ratov.

578
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,203
He would love your birds and flowers.

579
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,038
(Stops playing) You don't?

580
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,916
- lf you were a dancer, you'd know...
- Just a minute.

581
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,003
♪ Nothing matters but the music!

582
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,550
lt's hard enough to get off the ground, anyway,
without being a bird or a flower.

583
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,017
Aren't you going to imagine anything
on the first night?

584
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,188
Yes, a wall between me and the audience.

585
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,411
My music will pull you through it.

586
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,663
(Dramatic chord)

587
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,384
(Orchestra plays)

588
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,988
Hee-haw!

589
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,367
Miss Page, l am not a circus conductor
and you are not a horse.

590
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,576
lt's too fast.

591
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:08,163
- You would not find it too fast...
- (Grischa shouts) Both of you!

592
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:13,001
You would not find it too fast if you'd let the slow
passage end before you start your pirouette.

593
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,587
My downbeat marks a pause.

594
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,215
We understand it, don't we, gentlemen?
N'est-ce pas?

595
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,802
- You come in on the second beat.
- lmpossible!

596
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,221
One, two, tia, tia!

597
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,099
lt's quite simple. You see this baton?

598
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,351
- Yes.
- Well, follow it!

599
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,272
Oh!

600
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,985
(Orchestra tuning up)

601
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,219
WOMAN: Regardez comme elle est jolie.

602
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:09,099
- Ah mais ça lui fait une taille énorme, du coup.
- Laissez-moi tranquille.

603
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,976
(Knock at door)

604
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,853
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

605
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,898
- Vicky. Vicky!
- (Women chatter in French)

606
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,609
Dance whatever tempo you like. l'll follow you.

607
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,862
(Women sigh)

608
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,657
All right?

609
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,325
Time to go down, Craster.

610
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,161
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

611
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,746
- Nervous?
- No.

612
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,789
Come on!

613
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,550
Do l...?

614
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,635
What the devil have you got to worry about?

615
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:49,639
lt's a fine score.
A magnificent score. l only wish l...

616
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,309
Go on.

617
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,773
(Applause)

618
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:16,750
(Dramatic introduction)

619
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:27,719
- Va chercher Monsieur Ljubov.
- Oui, tout de suite, mon petit.

620
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,473
Louis, ferme les lumières.
Moi, je baisse la main droite.

621
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,227
- Grischa.
- lt's chaos, chaos, chaos!

622
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,479
- Grischa...
- Ah, Boris.

623
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,942
- Mon Dieu! The red shoes.
- What?

624
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,861
- The red shoes are not there!
- Rideaut.

625
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,656
- What have you done with the red shoes?
- Mademoiselle...

626
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,116
Don't waste your time! Where are they?

627
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,119
- You haven't hidden them yourself?
- No, no, no!

628
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,206
Yes! Fou! Fou!

629
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,417
Miss Page est dans un état! Elle est si nerveuse!

630
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,753
Ca alors!

631
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,801
Boris, look here.

632
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,553
Elephants.

633
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,972
Clumsy elephants have ruined my décor.

634
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:15,892
- Calm yourself.
- The door! The door! lt won't shut.

635
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,520
- Somebody must hold it.
- But who?

636
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,605
The call boy. He will have nothing to do.

637
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:24,109
- Dimitri.
- Give it to me. Hold the door.

638
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,655
- Best of luck, Miss Page.
- l can't remember my entrance.

639
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,616
You think you can't remember it.
What about this?

640
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,660
(Hums tune)

641
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,497
Yes. That's it.
lt's all right when l hear the music.

642
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:42,919
Since you undoubtedly will hear the music,
it's undoubtedly going to be all right.

643
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:46,381
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

644
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,885
lf l had any doubts about you, l'd be nervous.

645
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,803
- Am l nervous?
- No.

646
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,180
You're not dancing for an audience.

647
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,224
You're dancing for Ljubov, Ratov, myself -

648
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:00,103
people for whom you've been dancing
many times before.

649
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,814
l believed in you from the very beginning.

650
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,066
But now everybody does.

651
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:10,113
l want you to dance tonight with the same
ecstasy l've seen in you only once before.

652
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,950
At the Mercury Theatre?

653
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,287
Yes, at the Mercury Theatre in London...

654
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,247
on a wet Saturday afternoon.

655
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,499
- 40 seconds.
- Coming.

656
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,545
Good luck, my dear.

657
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:29,841
You're a magician, Boris, to have produced
all this in three weeks - and from nothing.

658
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,470
The best magician in the world
can't produce a rabbit out of a hat

659
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,597
if there isn't already a rabbit in the hat.

660

(Music stops, applause)

661
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,913
lt's a pity the theatre only holds 300.

662
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,249
We could have filled the Albert Hall tonight!

663
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:07,295
Yes, but what we are creating tonight,
the world will talk of tomorrow.

664
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:13,093
Good boy.

665
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,053

All that clapping, bravos, roses...
Puff! All that's nothing.

692
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:56,113
But when l, who have seen Pavlova dance,
tell you that last night you were not bad -

693
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:00,576
not good, but not bad - that's something.

694
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,414
Now l tell you truth.

695
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,250
lt was...good.

696
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:09,960
Thank you, Mr Ljubov.

697
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,921
- My name is Grischa.

How do you do?

699

Arm straighter. So...

01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,346
Boris Lermontov wants to see you.

701
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:23,682
Why in the class time? Why?

702

(Lively chatter)

703
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:56,590

You're not disturbing me at all.

Quel est le nom du compositeur?

713
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:29,915
- Voilà, Monsieur Craster.
- Uh, Monsieur Craster?

714

Yes. Of course he's under contract to me.

715
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:39,007
Yes, he's going to. He's starting

Thank you very much. l'm proud of you.

730
01:26:16,462 --> 01:26:19,840

- Ah, yes! Do you read French?
- Yes.

l want to talk to you about your future.

736
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,154
When we first met,

737
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:45,824
you asked me a question
to which l gave a stupid answer.

738
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,994
You asked me whether
l wanted to live and l said yes.

739
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,039
Actually, l want more, much more!

740
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:56,627
l want to create, to make something big
out of something little.

741
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:00,589
To make a great dancer out of you.

742
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,759
But first, l must ask you the same question.

743
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,011
What do you want from life?

744
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:08,639
- To live?
- To dance.

745

in Monte Carlo.

Tell me, which is the very best restaurant
this year on the coast?

- Good night, Livy.

Book me a table.

- For...two?
- Yes.

Non, il est parti il y a cinq minutes
exactement. Au revoir.

No...no. l can't say l do.

Don't exaggerate.

829

Boris, we have a little romance in our midst.

- And Juliet...Page.

What does it matter where they've gone?

They are young,
they are together and they are in love.

And you know why it was impossible?

889
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:55,488
Because neither her mind
nor her heart were in her work.

890

She was...dreaming.

Nor is she likely to become one if she allows
herself to be sidetracked by idiotic flirtations.

01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:05,029
My dear children, l'm very sorry.

940
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:10,576
Boris might feel different in the morning.

941
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:15,414
The morning?
He's leaving for Paris by the 8.15 train.

942
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:48,447
Has the famous Miss Page come to see me off?

943
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,909
l'd like to talk to you.

944
01:45:01,712 --> 01:45:03,462
Tell me why you quarrelled with Julian.

945
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,089
There's only three minutes.

946
01:45:05,257 --> 01:45:08,676
May l suggest that such matters
are hardly your business?

947
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:14,432
However, since you've gone to all this trouble...

948
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:20,896
Mr Craster has been unwise enough
to interfere with certain plans of mine.

949
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,776
And that is something l do not permit.

950
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:31,449
l thought once that there would be
no room in my life for anything but dancing.

951
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,994
You'll think so again, my dear.

952
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,705
But if Julian goes, l shall go too.

953
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:42,668
And what do you intend to do?

954
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,503
l shall dance somewhere else.

955
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:46,714
Oh, yes.

956
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:50,301
That won't be very difficult
with the name l've given you.

957
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:54,305
Always provided l release you of your contract.

958
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,683
But even if l do...

959
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:00,728
..would it be quite the same?

960
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,482
l have never pretended to myself that it would.

961
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:12,948
l could make you one of the greatest dancers
the world has ever known.

962
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:18,412
Do you believe that?

963
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:21,040
Yes, l do.

964
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,378
And all that means nothing to you?

965
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:29,757
(Blast of whistle)
- You know exactly what it means to me.

966
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:31,884
En voiture! En voiture!

967
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:33,427
(Chatter from platform)

968
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,764
(Urgent knocking)
- The train is leaving!

969
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:41,727
Goodbye, Mr Lermontov.

970
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:49,944
Miss Page is coming!

971
01:46:57,953 --> 01:47:00,788
VICKY: Julian! Julian!

972
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:05,835
l'm coming with you!

973
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,754
Hooray!

974
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:21,100
(Dull roar of traffic)

975
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:11,150
The fool.

976
01:48:13,528 --> 01:48:15,404
Fool!

977
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:43,766
(Buzzer)

978
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:57,279
Come in. You are late.

979
01:48:57,447 --> 01:48:59,532
l hope you didn't work too hard.

980
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:02,743
All finished. l have the injunction with me.

981
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:36,902
Boris, don't tell me
you've changed your mind again.

982
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:40,948
Huh.

983
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:47,204
l...l don't want to stop her doing anything.

984
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,583
She can dance when and where she likes...

985
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,794
..except The Red Shoes.

986
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:56,672
- What about the boy?
- That's different.

987
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,717
Everything he's written
while under contract to me is mine.

988
01:49:59,884 --> 01:50:03,095
The Red Shoes and his work so far
on La Belle Meunière.

989
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:06,390
l'm not interested in anything else he may write.

990
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:10,352
But if you keep The Red Shoes in the repertoire,
you'll have to pay him royalties.

991
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,938
The Red Shoes is no longer in the repertoire!

992
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:15,399
Oh.

993
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:26,118
l understand Patrick Trevellyan's in Paris.

994
01:50:27,203 --> 01:50:28,495
Yes.

995
01:50:28,663 --> 01:50:30,748
l dined with them both last night.

996
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:33,083
Oh?

997
01:50:33,251 --> 01:50:35,919
- Boronskaja was with him?
- Yes.

998
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:39,089
Anything l can do?

999
01:50:39,257 --> 01:50:41,508
How's their marriage? Success?

1000
01:50:41,676 --> 01:50:43,761
Patrick seems to think so.

1001
01:50:44,262 --> 01:50:47,931
Would you like me to arrange
a meeting with lrina?

1002
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:51,310
Not "arrange".

1003
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,521
By chance.

1004
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:22,007
(Dog yaps)

1005
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:26,428
Oh! Boris!

1006
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,018
♪ Les Sylphides

1007
01:51:58,586 --> 01:52:01,004
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, lrina.

1008
01:52:01,923 --> 01:52:03,424
(Door closes)

1009
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:06,635
- Good season.
- With the Ballet Lermontov, always.

1010
01:52:07,762 --> 01:52:08,679
(Door opens)

1011
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,348
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

1012
01:52:12,016 --> 01:52:13,183
- Sergei!
- Yes?

1013
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:16,770
- Would you come in and wait a minute, please?
- Yes, of course, Boris.

1014
01:52:21,526 --> 01:52:25,154
- Good night, Boris!
- Grischa, please come in and wait.

1015
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:29,116
Oh...a conference.

1016
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:33,746
- Ah!
- Urgh!

1017
01:52:38,293 --> 01:52:40,377
Letters.

1018
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:44,256
- Nobody writes to me.
- That's not true.

1019
01:52:44,966 --> 01:52:47,426
Yours...from Vicky.

1020
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:49,928
From Vicky?

1021
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:52,514
- How is that girl?
- Read it. You'll see.

1022
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:58,103
And this is from Julian.
lt's all about his new opera.

1023
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:01,732
lt describes the whole structure.

1024
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:05,944
Enormous talent, that boy.

1025
01:53:09,491 --> 01:53:11,158
He says...

1026
01:53:11,993 --> 01:53:14,077
"She is an inspiration.

1027
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:17,790
A miracle."

1028
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:21,335
- Thank you, Mr Boudin. That's all.
- Merci. Bonsoir.

1029
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:24,588
Well...l see it's mail day.

1030
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:27,216
From our two young rebels.

1031
01:53:27,383 --> 01:53:31,220
Deserters. l hope they're happy.

1032
01:53:31,387 --> 01:53:34,389
- Read, Boris.
- Yes. Read this, too.

1033
01:53:34,557 --> 01:53:37,559
lt might make you sorry
to have lost that young man.

1034
01:53:38,186 --> 01:53:40,145
l doubt it.

1035
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:44,775
By the way, that reminds me, Jacques sent me
the new score of La Belle Meunière.

1036
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:50,739
l like it. l'd like you all to hear it at once.
We might open with it in London.

1037
01:53:50,907 --> 01:53:53,075
- With lrina?
- We can discuss that.

1038
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:57,120
Lights, all gaiety, fire.

1039
01:53:58,206 --> 01:54:01,708
Be good enough to glance through it.
And no prejudice, please.

1040
01:54:01,876 --> 01:54:03,710
l hope you say that to yourself sometimes.

1041
01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:05,838
(Chuckles) Every day. Good night.

1042
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:07,840
- Good night.
- Good night.

1043
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:11,635
On second thoughts,
l think l would like to read those letters.

1044
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:23,021
My letter was only meant to be read by me.

1045
01:54:23,773 --> 01:54:27,150
- See you later, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

1046
01:54:35,577 --> 01:54:38,203
l could hardly let him read it.

1047
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:43,709
She calls him a monster - a gifted, cruel monster.

1048
01:54:43,877 --> 01:54:46,378
(Laughs) You should have told him that.

1049
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:49,691
(Operatic singing)

1050
01:56:40,618 --> 01:56:42,703
(Julian composes on piano)

1051
01:58:18,382 --> 01:58:20,467
(Julian plays with left hand)

1052
01:59:12,186 --> 01:59:14,563
(Door bursts open)

1053
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:17,315
l...l am sorry to be late, Boris Lermontov.

1054
01:59:23,656 --> 01:59:25,365
Lady Neston was in front tonight.

1055
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:30,871
She arrived this morning.
She is staying for several weeks.

1056
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:35,917
And Miss Page is joining her next week
for a short holiday.

1057
02:00:04,113 --> 02:00:05,989
(Knock at door)

1058
02:00:07,491 --> 02:00:10,076
We seem to be destined
to meet at railway stations.

1059
02:00:10,244 --> 02:00:11,411
WOMAN: Vite, vite!

1060
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:15,040
- What are you doing in Cannes?
- Waiting for you. Won't you sit?

1061
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:28,261
But you know, my dear Vicky,
how l'm always looking for great dancers.

1062
02:00:35,478 --> 02:00:37,020
We all have missed you.

1063
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:41,983
And l was hoping that by now
you would have started to miss us...a little.

1064
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:45,195
l have.

1065
02:00:46,113 --> 02:00:48,198
You only have to say the words.

1066
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:52,619
- How is everybody?
- lncluding me?

1067
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:54,287
- lncluding you.
- Never better.

1068
02:00:54,455 --> 02:00:57,332
- How is Grischa?
- Always fighting with Boronskaja.

1069
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,001
- And she?
- Always fighting with Grischa.

1070
02:01:00,169 --> 02:01:02,045
- How is old Sergei?
- Getting younger.

1071
02:01:02,213 --> 02:01:04,297
- And you?
- Getting older.

1072
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:07,425
And you? You are happy?

1073
02:01:07,593 --> 02:01:09,678
Yes. Very happy.

1074
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:12,889
As a dancer, I mean.

1075
02:01:14,225 --> 02:01:16,351
l haven't danced very much, you know.

1076
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:19,062
Oh, I know, I know.
l know every time you have danced.

1077
02:01:20,648 --> 02:01:23,024
- But you never stopped working?
- No.

1078
02:01:23,192 --> 02:01:25,777
- And you never stopped going to class?
- Never.

1079
02:01:28,364 --> 02:01:30,573
And why isn't he with you?

1080
02:01:30,741 --> 02:01:34,953
His opera's been accepted at Covent Garden.
It's in rehearsal now.

1081
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:38,748
- Would he give it up if you ask him?
- l don't know.

1082
02:01:38,916 --> 02:01:40,250
- You do know.
- l wouldn't ask.

1083
02:01:40,418 --> 02:01:44,045
Then why is he asking you?
Does he know what he is asking?

1084
02:01:52,555 --> 02:01:58,351
We are preparing a new ballet.
We've been working at it for weeks.

1085
02:01:58,519 --> 02:02:02,439
The costumes and the décor
are the most beautiful Ratov has ever done.

1086
02:02:02,606 --> 02:02:06,067
Grischa's full of enthusiasm.
And you know what that means?

1087
02:02:11,657 --> 02:02:15,410
Nobody else has ever danced The Red Shoes
since you left.

1088
02:02:17,705 --> 02:02:19,789
Nobody else ever shall.

1089
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:27,172
Put on the red shoes, Vicky...
and dance for us again.

1090
02:02:36,515 --> 02:02:39,142
This is the BBC Third Programme.

1091
02:02:39,310 --> 02:02:42,395
l am speaking from the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London.

1092
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:49,819
Tonight is the first night of Cupid And Psyche,
a new opera by British composer Julian Craster,

1093
02:02:49,987 --> 02:02:54,324
whose only well-known work has been
the score for the ballet The Red Shoes.

1094
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:57,035
The Red Shoes was a great success

1095
02:02:57,203 --> 02:03:00,497
when produced at Monte Carlo last year
with the Ballet Lermontov,

1096
02:03:00,664 --> 02:03:03,166
but has not yet been seen in this country.

1097
02:03:06,128 --> 02:03:08,505
Oh, something must have gone wrong,
l'm afraid.

1098
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:11,508
l think somebody's going to make
an announcement.

1099
02:03:11,675 --> 02:03:13,468
Ladies and gentlemen,

1100
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:17,430
l regret to announce
that Mr Julian Craster the composer,

1101
02:03:17,598 --> 02:03:21,851
who was to conduct his own opera,
has been suddenly taken ill.

1102
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:26,481
Sir Hartley Menzies will conduct in his place.

1103
02:03:27,858 --> 02:03:31,778
Here comes Sir Hartley Menzies now.
l'll announce the cast during the interval.

1104
02:03:31,946 --> 02:03:32,904
(Applause)

1105
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:35,156
(Door closes)

1106
02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:40,870
ll est moins le quart, monsieur.

1107
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:50,505
All the way down from London,
l wondered if l'd find you here.

1108
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:53,258
And here you are.

1109
02:03:54,468 --> 02:03:56,845
So you left your first night?

1110
02:03:57,012 --> 02:03:58,138
Yes.

1111
02:03:58,305 --> 02:04:00,390
Oh, Julian.

1112
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:03,518
Why didn't you?

1113
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:11,276
- Oh, Julian.
- (He sobs)

1114
02:04:13,487 --> 02:04:15,572
All right, love, my sweetheart.

1115
02:04:16,407 --> 02:04:19,742
There's a train to Paris at 8.00.
We'll be on it together.

1116
02:04:21,370 --> 02:04:23,204
Better hurry up and get changed.

1117
02:04:23,372 --> 02:04:25,582
- But l'm dancing tonight.
- Walk out.

1118
02:04:27,334 --> 02:04:29,043
Good evening, Mr Craster.

1119
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:32,213
Won't they be missing you
at Covent Garden tonight?

1120
02:04:32,381 --> 02:04:34,174
- ll est moins dix.
- Je sais.

1121
02:04:34,341 --> 02:04:36,509
Oh, for God's sake!
Leave me alone, both of you!

1122
02:04:36,677 --> 02:04:39,262
Please, Julian,
wait until after the performance.

1123
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:41,097
lt'll be too late then.

1124
02:04:41,265 --> 02:04:45,685
You're already too late, Mr Craster.
Tell him why you've left him.

1125
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:47,687
- l haven't left him!
- Oh, yes, you have.

1126
02:04:47,855 --> 02:04:50,565
Nobody can have two lives -
and your life is dancing.

1127
02:04:50,733 --> 02:04:53,943
Vicky, you can dance anywhere else
in the whole world.

1128
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:57,363
Would you be satisfied with anything less
than the best?

1129
02:04:57,740 --> 02:04:59,782
lf you would, you'd never be a great artist.

1130
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:02,452
Would you make her a great dancer as well?

1131
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:04,037
Never!

1132
02:05:04,205 --> 02:05:08,666
Why do you think l've waited day after day
for a chance to win her back?

1133
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:13,004
- Because you're jealous of her.
- Yes! I am.

1134
02:05:14,048 --> 02:05:16,090
But in a way that you will never understand.

1135
02:05:16,258 --> 02:05:18,718
- Il est moins cinq!
- Faut-il tenir le rideau?

1136
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:20,553
Oui!

1137
02:05:25,851 --> 02:05:30,647
- Well, Vicky?
- l love you, Julian! Nobody but you!

1138
02:05:31,357 --> 02:05:33,441
(Vicky sobs)

1139
02:05:34,318 --> 02:05:35,944
But you love that more.

1140
02:05:37,029 --> 02:05:39,822
l don't know! l don't know.

1141
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:42,242
(Julian's opera continues on wireless)

1142
02:05:42,409 --> 02:05:45,453
lf you go with him now,
l will never take you back. Never!

1143
02:05:46,497 --> 02:05:48,790
Vicky, do you want to destroy our love?

1144
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:51,084
Adolescent nonsense!

1145
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:54,963
All right. Go, then. Go with him.

1146
02:05:55,130 --> 02:06:00,468
Be a faithful housewife
with a crowd of screaming children!

1147
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,720
Finish with dancing forever!

1148
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:05,139
JULlAN: Vicky...look at me.

1149
02:06:24,535 --> 02:06:26,619
Goodbye, then, my darling.

1150
02:06:30,749 --> 02:06:32,834
Julian.

1151
02:06:36,171 --> 02:06:38,923
Monsieur Lermontov,
peut-on commencer l'ouverture?

1152
02:06:40,175 --> 02:06:42,343
- Oui. Commencez.
- Bon. Bon. Bon.

1153
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:45,221
Alors, commencez toute de suite.
vite! vite!

1154
02:06:45,806 --> 02:06:47,890
Vicky...

1155
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:53,187
Vicky. Little Vicky.

1156
02:06:56,066 --> 02:06:59,485
There it is, all waiting for you.

1157
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:03,281
The sorrow will pass, believe me.

1158
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:06,451
Life is so unimportant.

1159
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:12,832
And from now onwards, you will dance...

1160
02:07:13,876 --> 02:07:15,960
..like nobody ever before.

1161
02:07:36,023 --> 02:07:38,107
(Julian's opera drowns out speech)

1162
02:07:51,622 --> 02:07:52,955
Qu'est-ce que tu as?

1163
02:07:53,123 --> 02:07:55,208
Mon petit.

1164
02:07:56,043 --> 02:07:57,460
Où vas-tu?

1165
02:07:57,628 --> 02:07:59,545
Mon petit! (Screams)

1166
02:07:59,713 --> 02:08:00,797
Monsieur Lermontov!

1167
02:08:00,964 --> 02:08:03,049
(Dramatic music)

1168
02:08:10,641 --> 02:08:12,809
Mademoiselle Page! Où allez-vous?

1169
02:08:12,976 --> 02:08:15,061
(Train horn)

1170
02:08:34,665 --> 02:08:35,790
No!

1171
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,814
(Music stops)

1172
02:09:04,278 --> 02:09:06,362
(Silence)

1173
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:27,216
Ladies...and gentlemen!

1174
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:35,183
l'm sorry...to tell you...

1175
02:09:38,228 --> 02:09:40,313
..that Miss Page...

1176
02:09:41,273 --> 02:09:43,357
..is unable...

1177
02:09:44,151 --> 02:09:47,236
..to dance...tonight.

1178
02:09:47,404 --> 02:09:49,489
(Gasps from audience)

1179
02:09:50,866 --> 02:09:52,158
Nor indeed...

1180
02:09:54,077 --> 02:09:55,453
..any other nights.

1181
02:09:55,621 --> 02:09:57,705
(More shocked gasps)

1182
02:09:58,832 --> 02:09:59,665
(Murmuring)

1183
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:02,001
Nevertheless...

1184
02:10:03,712 --> 02:10:05,797
..we've decided...

1185
02:10:08,592 --> 02:10:12,678
..to present...The Red Shoes!

1186
02:10:18,227 --> 02:10:20,311
lt...is...

1187
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:23,564
..the ballet...

1188
02:10:26,109 --> 02:10:28,194
..that made her name...

1189
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:33,783
..whose name...she made.

1190
02:10:35,327 --> 02:10:38,204
We...present it...

1191
02:10:41,583 --> 02:10:43,668
..because...

1192
02:10:47,256 --> 02:10:49,131
..we think...

1193
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:56,222
..she would have...wished it.

1194
02:10:57,599 --> 02:10:59,684
(Orchestra plays)

1195
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:27,628
(Murmuring)

1196
02:11:33,844 --> 02:11:35,052
Pas d'espoir.

1197
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:37,305
(Low groans)

1198
02:11:44,938 --> 02:11:46,606
Julian?

1199
02:11:46,773 --> 02:11:48,733
Yes, my darling?

1200
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:50,985
Take off the red shoes.
