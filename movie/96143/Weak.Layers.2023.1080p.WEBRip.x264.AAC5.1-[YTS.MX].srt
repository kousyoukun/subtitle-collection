3
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:21,607
So I'm not even allowed
to be mad

4
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:23,126
'cause he's gay?

5
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,612
I know, I'm pissed.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,408
I am definitely not, not pissed.

7
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,689
Like we had sex, like a lot.

8
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:36,898
I mean maybe not a lot, a lot,

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,625
but it was still sex, you know?

10
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,182
Okay. Sorry,
but are you in finance?

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,736
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I can tell.

12
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,393
Are you?

13
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,844
I'm, I'm like an outdoor
adventure filmmaker.

14
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:53,087
Like Scott Gaffney.

15
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:54,192
That rock climber guy?.

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,365
No, that is Jimmy Chin.

17
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:56,815
And he is not the only guy

18
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:59,714
that makes movies in
the outdoors.

19
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,684
Gaffney's like more core,
like for the people.

20
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,791
That's the kind of filmmaker
that I am.

21
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:09,034
Anything I've seen?

22
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:10,484
Of mine?

23
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,728
Uh, it's more of a passion
right now.

24
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:17,939
Lot of rejection.

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,079
Well, I bet you're amazing.

26
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:21,322
Ah. Never stop grinding.

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,875
Even when everybody's like,

28
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:25,154
"Cleo, you're actually
kind of bad at this.

29
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,639
Cleo, You've been living here
for 10 years

30
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,159
and nothing's happened
in your career yet."

31
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,920
"Cleo, your boyfriend's gay."

32
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,239
Ex. Ex-boyfriend.

33
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,174
You know what? Good for him.

34
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:46,036
Let's do shots.

35
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,804
Town's so busy because of
Hot Lapse.

36
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:57,358
Hot laps?
Like skiing?.

37
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:58,670
Four shots of whiskey.

38
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:00,465
No Hot Lapse.

39
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,018
With an E.

40
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,503
The ski movie competition.

41
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,504
Oh my God.

42
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,680
Literally anyone in the
industry that matters

43
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,337
all in the same place

44
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,132
competing to make the best
ski movie in 72 hours.

45
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,479
Whoa, cool. Good luck.

46
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,515
No, I'm not in it.

47
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,999
It is like the real deal.

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,966
It's for the pros.

49
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,416
I'm, I'm a nobody.

50
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,383
She fucking calls
me a sexist.

51
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,213
Are you fucking kidding
me? Asian?

52
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:26,146
Oh, that's Lucy.
That's my roommate Lucy.

53
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:28,665
How am I propping up
the patriarchy?

54
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:31,116
'Cause I don't geotag my
fishing spots?

55
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:32,600
Okay. Okay.

56
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,706
Jack Kero-woke, you
fucking Instagram poser.

57
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,397
Do the work yourself.

58
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,537
Honestly, Lucy's probably
the best skier in town

59
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:39,883
that nobody's ever heard of.

60
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,402
Which is saying something

61
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,508
'cause my other roommate is
an Olympian.

62
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,682
Well was an Olympian.
She's retired.

63
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,719
It's actually kind of
a sensitive subject.

64
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:49,341
Tina. Where is she?

65
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,762
We can't get caught
doing this.

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,385
Are you in town for
the competition.

67
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,903
Flew in from Japan last night.

68
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,664
Oh, sick. Ja-pow.

69
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:06,772
Hokkaido?

70
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,258
I'm fucking with you
bro. I'm from Idaho.

71
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:10,880
I'm Chinese, not Japanese,
there's a difference

72
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,744
and I don't believe in
competitive sports.

73
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:17,576
I know what you're thinking.
We're living the dream.

74
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:22,340
I really don't
actually like whiskey very much.

75
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:25,895
Yo, Daron, look. Tina's
got her cans out for you.

76
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,034
Did you take a lesson?

77
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,795
- Yeah.
- You rent stuff?

78
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,866
Pizza. French fries.
Pizza. French fries.

79
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,799
Okay.

80
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,630
So the bear rears up on his
haunches, I chamber my rifle,

81
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,252
my buddy goes,
"Take the shot, Luce."

82
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,599
So I aim right where his
heart should be,

83
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,533
turns out their organs str-

84
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,363
Oh crap. Fuck.

85
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,295
Uh oh.

86
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:48,642
Oh no.

87
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,957
They're 10 years younger
than me.

88
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:56,097
I gotta parent. Stand by.

89
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,721
Ooh.

90
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,722
Oh.

91
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,139
Whoa.

92
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,454
Whoa. Yo, Tina.

93
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:09,076
Tina.

94
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,803
Seriously, Cleo? Shut up!

95
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:13,460
I'm in love.

96
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,082
Okay. I'm ha- I'm really
happy for you.

97
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,601
But hi, nice to meet you.

98
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,154
We gotta go.
Do you know what time it is?

99
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,949
Tab. Bring him.

100
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,709
- Anthony, come on.
- Whoa, what are you...?

101
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,228
Okay, you can get me
a drink another time.

102
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,436
Afterparty!

103
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:30,649
Afterparty!

104
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,345
Send it, you pussy.

105
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,829
Woo.

106
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,320
Is this your real life?

107
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,390
Mm, yeah.

108
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,009
This is awesome.

109
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,700
You should be like filming this.

110
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:22,701
Nah.

111
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,980
You think?
You could be just like

112
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,223
that Daffy guy you were
talking about.

113
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,328
Gaffney.

114
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,915
Yeah, that guy.

115
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:31,158
You could be the next him.

116
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,366
All right my turn.

117
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:34,989
Lucy! Lucy!

118
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,715
Lucy! Lucy!
What!?

119
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,632
Oh, fuck.

120
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:00,498
Fuck, I missed.

121
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:12,095
This is fucking Oscar-worthy.

122
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,031
Yeah, yeah move.

123
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,607
Welcome to the afterparty!

124
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:00,247
Give her the onion!

125
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,455
Disgusting.

126
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:04,838
Let's fucking party!

127
00:07:57,994 --> 00:08:01,101
♪ Four, three, two, one ♪

128
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:51,565
Disgusting,
uncouth, uncivilized animals.

129
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,084
Stop with the
adjectives. You wanna come in?

130
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:55,017
Grab a drink?
I've never seen such utter

131
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,640
and callous disregard for
someone else's property.

132
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:58,745
You're out.

133
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:00,125
I want you gone by tonight.

134
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:02,300
Bro, I might be dead
by tonight.

135
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:04,405
Is it even legal to
evict someone like this?

136
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,062
- No.
- I don't care.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,272
You three are easily
the foulest young women

138
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,550
I've ever encountered.

139
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:12,241
Absolutely vile.

140
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:17,211
I mean that feels
like a bit of a stretch.

141
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:21,802
Great timing.

142
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,944
You banged pizza,
french fries guy.

143
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:27,877
I did.

144
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,708
Unfortunately.

145
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,712
Yeah, you wanna go left.

146
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,238
You still wanna ski today?

147
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,239
No.

148
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,077
Fuck her.

149
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,256
So we're homeless.

150
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:05,018
Easy come, easy go.

151
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:06,709
Not that easy.

152
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,056
We have to get first,
last, and security deposit

153
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:11,438
for a new place, which is
like five grand in this town.

154
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,922
Meh.

155
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,372
I met the man in my dreams
last night.

156
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,407
There's two feet of blower
pow outside.

157
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:16,546
What? Who?

158
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:20,033
Pirates of the Baberian.

159
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,517
I'm seeing it.

160
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,762
Dreadlocks.

161
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,868
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

162
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:30,008
No dreads.
But it's a little blurry.

163
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,528
Point is, I say we go skiing.

164
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,256
Can we figure out where
we're sleeping tonight first?

165
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,982
Tina can pay for that.

166
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,224
She's an Olympian.

167
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,364
All her sponsors dropped her.

168
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:43,608
And where is she by the way?

169
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:44,609
Missing.

170
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,267
Like missing persons missing.

171
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,338
No. Missing.

172
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:50,650
So we're not worried.

173
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:51,961
Nice. Good for her.

174
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,446
Okay,
I'm gonna load the sleds.

175
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:59,624
That was a late night pull.

176
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:01,143
Hey, Marty.

177
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:02,903
Hey, Vidiots girl.

178
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,735
Heck of a storm, isn't it?

179
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,081
Sure is.

180
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:11,118
- Hey, I saw your video.
- Oh, God.

181
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,431
Feel free to erase that from
your memory.

182
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,985
All right. I'll see ya.

183
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,650
♪ But I'll tell ya boy,

187
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:44,255
I was just finishing up
a thought.

188
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:45,843
Take your time.

189
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,263
I hear Dane Blake and your
boy Gabe Paul

190
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,505
are up here for Hot Lapse.

191
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:55,715
My boy.

192
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,337
Whatever.

193
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,340
Bet you think he's hot too.

194
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:02,238
Is this like a closure talk?

195
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,620
No. Closed as she gets,
I'd say.

196
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:08,175
Is there an actual reason
as to why you're here?

197
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,729
I need your van.

198
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:23,294
We got evicted.
Get a hotel.

199
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,813
- We have no money.
- None?

200
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,780
- Like very little.
- Sell your sleds.

201
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:28,195
No. Ross.

202
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,472
You know I love this van.

203
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,922
Well, we'll treat it

204
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,268
like we're meticulous gay
mountain men.

205
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:34,132
Hmm, semi-homophobic jabs.

206
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,583
Probably not your best
angle right now.

207
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:39,482
Ross, this is me being chill.

208
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,106
You dated me for way longer
than you should have.

209
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,970
And even though I actually
hate you right now,

210
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,350
you're still my best friend

211
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,627
because I don't have
a new one yet.

212
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,112
So olive branch.

213
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,773
Gimme your van.

214
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,164
One week.

215
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,339
Not anymore.

216
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:09,719
One week max.

217
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,480
Probably less.

218
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:15,173
Do not let your heathen
roommates fuck it up please.

219
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,347
Okay. Okay.

220
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:24,873
Tina.
Oh my God.

221
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,495
Have you ever slept in
a fire truck?

222
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,359
It's so comfortable.

227
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,134
Yeah,
I figured.

228
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:46,756
Nice hat.
Thanks.

229
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:49,380
Won it playing poker with
the fire boys.

230
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:50,968
Oh my.

231
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,521
Is this Ross's van?

232
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,006
Oh no. This is our new home.

233
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:57,837
Yeah, we live here now.
Surprise.

234
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:03,566
It was Lucy, wasn't it?

235
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,120
I mean it was a group effort.

236
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,701
So that video I made.

237
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,737
The afterparty one?

238
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,119
Got the most views of
anything I ever made.

239
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:41,156
It kinda went viral.

240
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,158
Not like viral,
but like kind of.

241
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,919
You should totally
enter Hot Lapse.

242
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,541
Yeah, totally.

243
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,440
Actually,
that's an exceptional idea.

244
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,649
You don't just show
up to Hot Lapse like,

245
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,133
"Hi, my friend thinks
I should be in this."

246
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,894
You first of all dedicate
your life

247
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:56,965
to the thankless machine
that is adventure filmmaking.

248
00:14:57,103 --> 00:15:00,692
Okay, well, Cleo, have
you ever even applied?

249
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,970
I'm a realistic person.

250
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,695
You're a visionary.

251
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,766
And not only when you're drunk.

252
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,665
Also the prize money's 10 grand.

253
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:10,426
Which I wouldn't win even if
I did get in, which I won't.

254
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,981
We need a real way to
come up with five grand.

255
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,362
Skiing can't solve all of
our problems.

256
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,778
If you won,
it would solve most of them.

257
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,366
Not happening.

258
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:22,438
I'll strip before I enter
that goddamn competition.

259
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,337
Why does it always
come down to stripping?

Be cool.

286
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,260
I'm in heat.

287
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:26,986
It's these like
new sleds, man.

288
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,505
There's like all the throttles
all off.

289
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:31,093
It's for sure the sleds.

290
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,923
Well I'll try
to go whiskey with it.

291
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,374
I think the guy who's
sled's stuck is Dane Blake.

292
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,100
Did he bleach his hair?

293
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:40,033
Oh my God, he wants
to be Hollywood so badly.

294
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,034
Should we go help them?

295
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,381
Yeah.

296
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,008
Now my knee's
fucked up.

297
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:51,734
Got her in there good.

298
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,636
Um, tell you what,
let me take your sled.

299
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:59,018
I'll head back to town,
we'll grab some guys,

300
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:00,881
'cause I don't know how
the two of us

301
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,882
are gonna get this done.

302
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,436
We can help you out.

303
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:04,954
Uh, thank you but I
think this is gonna take

304
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,543
a little manpower,
but it's very sweet.

305
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,200
I've seen worse.

306
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:12,548
Plus hate for you to get
stuck in another tree well

307
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,861
all by yourself out there.

308
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:21,937
Whoa. Nice sleds.

309
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,457
Yeah,
they're really brand new.

310
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,769
Haven't quite broken
them in yet.

311
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,771
Where are you
guys headed?

312
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,084
Fucking nowhere now.

313
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,465
I love it there.

314
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:43,165
Great. More manpower.

315
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,477
Dude.

316
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,453

317
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,565

Sure.

318
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,601
Be my guest.

319
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,128
That's my girl. Woo.

320
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,821
Sometimes just takes
a woman's touch.

321
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,927
Oh great. A feminist.

322
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,378
Thank you ladies.

323
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,968
We're trying to find
Pothole Basin.

324
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,281
It's about three
miles that way.

325
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,111
- That way?
- Uh-huh.

326
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:34,596
Thanks.

327
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,599
Okay. He's like really hot.

328
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:39,014
Unbelievable.

329
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,812
Pothole Basin's that way, huh?

330
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,990
Mm, mm, mm.

331
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,789
♪ A real good puss ♪

332
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,378
And, uh, 60 chicken nuggets.

333
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:01,485
Who has money?

334
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,659
- Platinum's maxed.
- Gambling problem.

335
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,109
Oh, God.

336
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:08,043
Yo,
this one looks perfect.

337
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,872
Two bedrooms, wood stove,

338
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,358
no electricity, outhouse?

339
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,222
Aka, off grid.

340
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,154
So cool.

341
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,570
2300 a month cool?

342
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,054
I still think you
should apply to Hot Lapse.

343
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,987
Tina. I literally can't
with this.

344
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,851
I'm with Tina.

345
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,404
We're not gonna make $5,000
in two weeks any other way.

346
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,888
Uh, there's a free ride
competition this weekend.

347
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,373
Why can't you compete?

348
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:29,098
Dude. I don't believe in
competition.

349
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:31,100
Filmmaking is your passion.

350
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,206
Passion is not how you
make money.

351
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,243
Passion is the only way for
millennials to make money.

352
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,830
Even if I were to get in,

353
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:37,831
I'd be up against the
best ski movie directors

354
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,212
in the entire industry

355
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,525
and their handpicked pro
skier farm teams.

356
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,354
But you have Lucy.

357
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,012
And she'll huck her meat
off anything.

358
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,463
I'm a bonafide Olympian,

359
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,224
and incredibly unique for
a ski movie I might add.

360
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,778
And you're the gritty
storyteller to tie it
all together.

361
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,746
- Great points.
- Why not you?

362
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:58,266
I'll look like a loser.

363
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:00,613
What are you 14? Who cares.

364
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,131
You know what?

365
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,305
Fine.

366
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:04,720
I'll apply to this stupid thing

367
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,377
just so you two lay
the fuck off.

368
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:07,344
Okay?

369
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:11,313
We don't need 60 chicken nugget,

370
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:12,970
I don't know why we get 60
chicken nuggets every time.

371
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:14,040
It's embarrassing. You guys
always make me order it.

372
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,628
And that's way too many nuggets.

373
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:18,078
I mean, it's
60 divided by 3, so...

374
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,563
Pissin' me off.

375
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:20,978
20 each.

376
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,129
Morning!

377
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,510
Free breakfast.

378
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,512
This spot's a gold mine.

379
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,307
What spot is this?

380
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,863
Welcome to Vidiots. A-hem.

381
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:22,004
I'm your host Cleo Brown,
aka Vidiots girl

382
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:23,903
for those of you who can't seem

383
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,251
to remember my incredibly
simple name.

384
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,875
New faces in the audience,

385
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:34,051
on Wednesdays we watch
amateur ski movies.

386
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,054
It's basically like Hot Lapse

387
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,814
but with less money

388
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:42,956
and more ego.

389
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,478
Nope. Okay, uh...

390
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:53,104
Wanted to extend a warm welcome
to the professional athletes

391
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:57,281
that are in town for this
weekend's festivities.

392
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,077
Huge fans here.

393
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:04,702
All following your climate
change activism careers closely.

394
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,534
Okay.

395
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:11,260
Uh, yeah,
let's just roll some clips.

396
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:20,269
What is
wrong with you?

397
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,893
It would take less time for
me to tell you what's right. -

398
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:26,759
This is the hospitality
business. As in be hospitable.

399
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,002
You're like a tornado of
shit lately.

400
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,108
Forgot your leadership style
is cripple them with shame.

401
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:34,594
If you wanna leave,
leave. No hard feelings.

402
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:36,251
Hold on. You're firing me?

403
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:40,013
I'm telling you to
figure your shit out, kid.

404
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,799
No, don't tell her.

405
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:08,732
Just say you talked to her.

406
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,389
It'll be fine.

407
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,805
Just tell her about the guy.

408
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:20,847
Thank You.

409
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,712
No.
It's very healing.

410
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:28,510
That's like what
alcoholics say.

411
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:29,822
Is she okay?

412
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,513
She says she had an awkward exit

413
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,481
with Pirates of the
Baberian at the coffee shop.

414
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,275
- Oh!
- Geez.

415
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,691
Turns out he's
working the free ride comp.

416
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:37,657
Uh-oh.

417
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:38,762
Did she do her pirouette?

418
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,763
Yep.

419
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,079
It's whatevers.

420
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,670
Yo, did Hot Lapse
call you yet?

421
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:54,122
- Uh, as a matter of fact-
- Oh! Congrats.

422
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,503
Uh, no.

423
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:58,022
Greg fucking loves you.

424
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,783
You know,
Greg from registration.

425
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:02,579
They think you're the next
big thing.

426
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:03,959
Huh?

427
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:05,754
No, it's not possible. I,
I didn't...

428
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,135
On your phone.

429
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,655
I talked to him this morning.

430
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:12,968
This 510,
you talked to this Greg guy

431
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:14,556
for 20 fucking minutes?

432
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,662
I felt like he needed
someone to talk to.

433
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,180
Wha...?

434
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:19,250
What I think she's saying
you got in.

435
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:20,631
There's no way.

436
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:21,701
No. Okay.

437
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,358
Take it down. Take her down.

438
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,428
We should probably go
find out for sure though.

439
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,016
I'm going back to bed.

440
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:28,018

471

How's Ross?
Oh, he's dead.

He died. He left me his van.

You gotta jiggle the wheel.

474
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,634
The throttle sticks and you
got a hot wire to start it.

00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:33,601

481

The big story this weekend
at Hot Lapse

482
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,273
is Dane Blake and Gabe Paul.

483
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,482
After a three year hiatus
following a tragic avalanche

484
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,968
that took the life of Gabe's
girlfriend, Sadie Lupin,

485
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:58,004
the iconic duo is back.

486
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,838
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

487
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,149
Team name?

488
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:06,634
- Um-
- Thought that was you.

489
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:07,980
Oh, have we met?

490
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,050
Uh, yeah.

491
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,984
You were the one,
I'm pretty sure,

492
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:17,127
that gave me those really great
directions to Pothole Basin.

493
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:19,439
Oh that, yeah,
that is ringing a bell.

494
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,579
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:23,098
Yeah. Oh, such a nice spot.

496
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:25,307
And I never,
never in a million years

497
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:26,792
would've found it without you.

498
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,276
I'm always happy to help

499
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:29,622
a lost tourist find his
way somewhere.

500
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,486
Yeah. I just feel so welcome.

501
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,350
You should, you should.

502
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:36,456
If I may,
I just wanna say it's great

503
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,941
to have you back, bro.

504
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,253
You're the greatest of all time.

505
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:41,841
Oh thanks, man.

506
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:46,674
I think this competitor
would like to register.

507
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:49,711
Yeah, for sure.

508
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:50,678
Team name?

509
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,304
Are you just gonna stay there?

510
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:57,305
Yeah.

511
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,517
Team Afterparty.

512
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:03,691
Afterparty.

513
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:05,416
- One word.
- Thank you.

514
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:08,488
It's after the party,
it's the...

515
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,355
Yeah, I'm not seeing it, but
what's like your name, name?

516
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:15,047
Cleo Brown.
But if we're not on there-

517
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:17,221
Wait, oh shit! You're Cleo?

518
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,223
Oh man, Greg saw your
edit on the grandmas.

519
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:23,469
Like these chicks are
sick. We gotta get them in.

520
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,955
He did?

521
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:29,061
- Legendary, bro.
- Legendary.

522
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,545
Only one room left in
the entire hotel.

523
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,237
But I think you're gonna dig it.

524
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,376
I don't have to put
like a credit card down

525
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:35,550
or anything, do I?

526
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,207
Oh no, no, no.
It's all comped.

527
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,898
Comped.

528
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,900
I just need you to sign
right here for me, please.

529
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,041
Welcome to the
shit show Cleo Brown.

530
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:45,180
Yo.

531
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,286
All right, good news.

532
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:49,875
Jill and Josh are stoked.

533
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:51,290
Uh, we should be good to go.

534
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:52,878
Are we dialed in here or...

535
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,294
Uh, no actually, would
you mind handlin' that?

536
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:56,744
Thanks man. Cheers.

537
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,401
Okay.

538
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:00,575
Hey. Hi.

539
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,714
Team name?

540
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:04,372
It's Dane Blake.

541
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:06,995
Holy shit.

542
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:12,794
The White Room.

543
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:17,592
I can't believe
this is happening.

544
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,490
This is gonna be the best
weekend ever.

545
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:20,629
Nicholas,
are you there?

546
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,631
Look, there's been a mistake.

547
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,564
You get those girls
outta there right away.

548
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,050
A last-minute VIP,
like I'm sorry.

549
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,224
You know how it goes.

550
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:32,365
But here's access cards
to all the amenities

551
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,885
and 400 for alternative lodging.

552
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:37,957
Can we get like
a parking pass?

553
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,579
Yeah, of course.

554
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,651
This is honestly than
being evicted.

555
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,724
I say we go fuck up
those Mindys.

556
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:48,934
- There's a party.
- Yeah.

557
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,107
Is it cold in there?

558
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:57,805
No flirting with
the celebrities.

559
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,220
We need to buckle down and
win this thing.

560
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:00,600
I literally get
the tingles

561
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,119
when you're all focused
like this.

562
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:03,258
Well, I'm serious.

563
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:04,639
No drinking, no boys.

564
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:07,884
Just 72 hours of
movie-making magic.

565
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:10,956
Um, yeah,
that's not gonna work for me.

566
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:13,648
Why? It's
like two days.

567
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,581
Of your entire lives.

568
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:19,171
I didn't drink for
19 years before the Olympics

569
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:20,828
and then I crashed.

570
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:21,863
Exactly. You
should have drank more.

571
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,727
That's what I'm saying.

572
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:25,177
That had nothing to
do with alcohol consumption.

573
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,868
So we can still drink?

574
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:31,355
No, I just need
to know I can count on you.

575
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,806
I don't wanna be pulling
like CIA operatives missions

576
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:36,705
all over town extracting
you from various locations.

577
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,811
Okay, Cleo,
we get it.

578
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:42,539
No full-steam ragers until
after we win.

579
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:44,023
Thank you.

580
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:45,714
Woo!

581
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,475
Party at the Taphouse ladies!
At the Taphouse!

582
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,132
- In the van.
- Hi.

583
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:53,343
They're not available.

584
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:58,382
Big dicks.

585
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:00,350
Large dicks.

586
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,318
Slightly curved dicks.

587
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:04,423
Nice dicks.

588
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:09,669
Okay. She's in her virtual
reality goggles, let's roll.

589
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,981
Grab the cash.

590
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,085
What? I drank less.

591
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:48,156
Only beers, no shots.

592
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:49,813
Just like you said.

593
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:53,196
Yo, check out this bad boy.

594
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:55,301
Where did you get that?

595
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,924
That's like a $20,000 camera.

596
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:58,926
The guys at Warren
Miller had an extra one.

597
00:30:59,064 --> 00:31:01,480
Everyone's so nice here.

598
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:03,689
What's it like being hot?

599
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:06,381
People just give you stuff?

600
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,073
Do you wanna use it or not?

601
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,039
Yes.

602
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:12,594
You're welcome.

603
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:14,251
Morning.

604
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:16,564
- Are they in this?
- Time's have changed bro.

605
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,600
Diversity before talent.

606
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:22,777
It's okay. I don't need a
pep talk on having thick skin.

607
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:23,778
I'm good.

608
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,577
I was just gonna tell
you to quit.

609
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:30,923
This whole thing is
just a bunch of assholes

610
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:32,476
and overpriced gear.

611
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,720
Save yourself the misery.

612
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,974
Vidiots girl. Rooting for you.

613
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:48,354
Thanks, Sheila.

614
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,322
Up against a pretty
heavy hitter.

615
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,393
Make us proud!

616
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:55,327

625
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,034
Whiskey break?

626
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,519
Do you maybe have like
a small drinking problem

627
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:51,970
or are you just in your 20s?

628
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:57,251
Woo.

629
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:02,049
I never thought I'd say this
but I kind of miss racing.

630
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,844
Filming's too much standing
and not enough skiing.

631
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,607
If this just being a pro,
no thanks.

632
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,160
Jimmy Chin nearly died

633
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:11,713
making every single one of
his movies, so.

634
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:14,164
Buck up girls.
We're just getting started.

635
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,235
Don't look at me like that.
Here she goes.

636
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,069
I want you to ski this
one from here.

637
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:24,036
You know what I'm saying?

638
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:26,521
Drop into that emotional truth.

639
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,040
Be the healing.

640
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:29,352
Turn, release.

641
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:33,080
Okay buddy?

642
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:36,186
Hey?

643
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:38,637
Yeah, I got it.

644
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:39,638
Okay.

645
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:42,192
I'll radio up.

646
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,469
Shred it. Woo!

647
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:14,569
Yo, I'm not even set up.

648
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:16,778
I told you I needed five.

649
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:22,715
Well, I guess you're
gonna be hiking.

650
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:25,580
Oh I didn't get nearly
enough footage today,

651
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:28,721
what we did get looks
really good.

652
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,103
This camera is so sick.

653
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,622
We're so sick.

654
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,968
Yes you are.

655
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:37,765
So I'm thinking tomorrow we just

656
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:39,422
tour off the summit in
the morning

657
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,044
and then go session Granite
Chief all afternoon.

658
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:42,735
I'm out for the morning sesh.

659
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,773
Well it's not optional,
Lucy, sorry.

660
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:48,293
They have my money already.

661
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:50,329
Who does?

662
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,988
You signed up for the free
ride competition tomorrow?

663
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,645
Accidentally.

664
00:34:55,783 --> 00:34:56,991
That's physically impossible.

665
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,613
Okay. True.

666
00:34:58,751 --> 00:34:59,994
I accidentally told
Pirates of the Baberian

667
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,823
I was competing.

668
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,515
He's gonna be there. So then
I had to actively sign up.

669
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,483
- Yeah, girl!
- No, not, "Yeah girl."

670
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:08,313
Since when do you even
believe in competition?

671
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:10,211
That's just something I
say to take the pressure off.

672
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:11,799
I thought that's what
the drinking was for.

673
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:13,249
That's for hooking up
with dudes.

674
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:15,320
Okay. This is so chaotic.

675
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,254
Have you even ever
competed before?

676
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:19,462
Tina? Help?

677
00:35:20,497 --> 00:35:21,981
It's easy.

678
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,500
You just dedicate your
entire childhood to it

679
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:24,984
and then your parents
get a divorce

680
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,538
because they don't
agree on coaching styles

681
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,126
and then you lose and
you let your whole family

682
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:29,541
and your entire country down.

683
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,337
Okay Tina,
just do your breathing.

684
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,133
I thought you wanted me
to do this.

685
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,479
Yeah. Before.

686
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,657
So I'm losing my best
skier to chasing a guy.

687
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:44,176
Best skier? Jesus.

688
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:45,833
Hey, hey, hey.

689
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:48,456
Winner takes $2,500. This
is a business decision.

690
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:51,149
Whoa. You could be onto
something.

691
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:52,702
Lucy could win tomorrow

692
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,222
and we could go touring
Sunday morning.

693
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,326
No big deal.

694
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,985
So we're still going to
Granite Chief tomorrow
afternoon?

695
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,919
I will be there. I promise.

696
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:04,058
Where are you going?

697
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:04,886
Nerves.

698
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:06,716
I need drink.

699
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:08,373
I'm chaperoning.

700
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:12,239
Take it easy tonight you
guys, please.

701
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:15,483
I need you both for
another two days.

702
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,141
Ah.

703
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,317
Chaperoning my fucking ass.

704
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:57,145
Okay. Okay.

705
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,388
How about this?

706
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:00,839
We open on a white stallion

707
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:03,876
and it's galloping across
the snow-covered glen.

708
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,499
This is Sadie personified.

709
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:06,741
- No.
- Yes.

710
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,640
Hear me out, okay?

711
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:13,783
Then it's a night shoot but
you are all lit up, LED suit.

712
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:14,887
- Oh, my God.
- Greens and purples

713
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,441
through the snow.

714
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:19,306
You're skiing through
your memories.

715
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,824
Whoosh, whoosh.

716
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:24,242
You're chasing the unattainable,
then bam!

717
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,105
It's fucking daylight.

718
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,901
And it's a metaphor for you
waking up out of your grief.

719
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,662
Absolutely not.

720
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,181
Dude come on. This is
what everybody wants.

721
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,253
The sponsors, the fans.
Oh fuck them.

722
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,013
- Fuck them?
- Yeah, fuck them.

723
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:39,912
We're not shooting a fucking
pity party for my grief

724
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,500
to sell fucking jackets.

725
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:43,399
Gabe, what is your idea?

726
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:45,953
Do you realize how outta
the game you've been?

727
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:47,472
You, you want to just
go out there and compete

728
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,645
with the 20 year olds?
I don't fucking...

729
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,095
I mean, you need an offering.

730
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,683
You need a story.
Well then tell one.

731
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:53,305
Just leave Sadie out of it.

732
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,444
Please tell me your
kitchen is still open.

733
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,825
Sorry, the kitchen is closed.

734
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:57,136
- No.
- This is a sick idea, Gabe.

735
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,862
No.

736
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,520
I promise you it's not. And
I'm not fucking doing it.

737
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:02,694
- This is the best idea
- Any fried pickle?

738
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:03,798
- I have.
- Like do you have

739
00:38:03,936 --> 00:38:05,075
a pickled green bean, maybe?

740
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:05,973
I'm sorry.
That's really sad.

741
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:06,974
Okay.

742
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,012
Three years off and you
really haven't gotten

743
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,152
any easier to deal with,
you know that?

744
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,500
And you get more brilliant
every fucking year, man.

745
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,813
I'm gonna be in my room and
if you can think of an idea,

746
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:20,712
you let me know, baby.

747
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,230
I wonder what Mossup's doing.

748
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,335
I wonder what
Crossland's doing.

749
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:24,371
Sorry about that.

750
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:25,855
Sorry, sorry.

751
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,789
I'm really sorry about that,
everybody.

752
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:34,139
Great.

753
00:38:35,002 --> 00:38:35,865
Perfect.

754
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:40,179
Are you gonna eat those?

755
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,357
Thank you. Okay.

756
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:48,740
Kitchen is closed and
I am starving.

757
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:52,468
Not in like a model way,
in like a poor person way.

758
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,159
Oh my gosh.

759
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,609
Lover's quarrel?

760
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:59,095
The entire bar did hear
that, right?

761
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,268
No, no.

762
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:02,857
Super low key. No, you're good.

763
00:39:02,995 --> 00:39:04,963
Oh God, that guy.

764
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:08,415
He's got very big plans for
my comeback.

765
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:09,726
He's like a big
plans guy, hey.

766
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:11,003
Oh yeah.

767
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,557
Yeah. Big plans guy.

768
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:14,904
Except for how to stay
relevant apparently.

769
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:17,424
You want me to
tell him or are you going to?

770
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:19,184
- If you wouldn't mind.
- I would love to.

771
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:20,737
He won't hear it from me.

772
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,050
No, I would happily do that
job for you.

773
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:25,846
God, I don't even know why he,

774
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:30,057
or I guess we, I guess,

775
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,921
I don't know why we are
even trying.

776
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:32,922
It's so...

777
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,684
You looked like you were
having fun out there today.

778
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:38,445
Hmm.

779
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,205
Well we can't all be salty
veterans like yourself.

780
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:42,276
What? How am I salty?

781
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,209
Ask the guy that told
me to quit this morning.

782
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:46,280
Ugh. That's...

783
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,420
I just think quitting
is a winning attitude.

784
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:51,389
That seems to be
working for you.

785
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:54,288
So you don't wanna compete,

786
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,808
you don't wanna sell
jackets, I heard that.

787
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:59,293
Like, what are you doing here?

788
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:01,985
That's a very good question,
Cleo Brown.

789
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,608
Thank you.

790
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:05,161
I think my therapist
would probably call it

791
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:08,267
an identity death or something.

792
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,268
Whoa.

793
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,236
What?

794
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:12,651
What? Was that too much?

795
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,135
You go to therapy?

796
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:16,068
Yeah.

797
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:20,487
Yeah, like I very much go to
therapy, like often.

798
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,454
That's so hot.

799
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:24,145
That's so hot?

800
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:25,457
- Yeah.
- Well,

801
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:30,151
you know,
when you watch an avalanche

802
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,637
take somebody that you love,

803
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:35,640
therapy becomes like a,

804
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:40,334
like a sexy little necessity,
you know?

805
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:45,028
If you want to not put like
a sexy bullet in your head.

806
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,654
That was too far.
Sorry about that.

807
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,138
Yeah, that was way too far.

808
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:53,312
Yeah, I was just kidding.

809
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,693
- I just wasn't-
- Not about the therapy, but.

810
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,281
- I wasn't expecting-
- Honesty?

811
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:58,835
Which is a yuck.

812
00:40:58,973 --> 00:40:59,836
Gross.

813
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,667
Wow. I'm having a day.

814
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:05,152
I'm gonna get another drink.
You want one?

815
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,291
Only if you're gonna tell me

816
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:07,395
more of your fucked up secrets.

817
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:08,362
Sure, why not?

818
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,260
Okay, but only one

819
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:14,472
'cause I am, I'm editing and
I am, I have to stay focused.

820
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,403
Yeah.

821
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:18,130
Two Long Island iced
teas please.

822
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,512
Yeah, right.

823
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,585
- Oof. A year and a half.
- Ah, it's so embarrassing.

824
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:26,691
Oh, it's nothing to
be embarrassed about.

825
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:29,210
It's just like you're like
a hopeless like romantic.

826
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:30,729
You know? It's like very like,

827
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,697
like Patti Smith, like
Robert Mapplethorpe.

828
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:35,078
It's like cool and chic and
like you're like an artist.

829
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:37,046
- You think?
- You got a blind spot.

830
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:38,185
Don't you beat yourself
up over it.

831
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:39,842
Huge blind spot.

832
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,326
I was like, maybe I'm
not that a good in bed.

833
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:43,673
Maybe I'm like not that-

834
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,192
- No. Come on.
- sexy.

835
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,504
It couldn't have been easy

836
00:41:46,642 --> 00:41:49,230
for your ex though
either, right?

837
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,924
What?

838
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:55,720
Yeah, I prob-- probably
wasn't.

839
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:59,033
It sucks for everybody.

840
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:03,106
- Fuck him though.
- Yeah. Fuck that guy.

841
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:05,074
I mean totally fuck that guy.

842
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:07,110
What's your film about?

843
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:09,388
Shredding and having
a good time.

844
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,287
Right? Yeah.

845
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:14,255
But like what's it about?

846
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:17,293
Shredding and having
a good time.

847
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:21,504
And the spirit of the mountains.

848
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,958
That sounds like that
could be pretty cool.

849
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:28,615
That could be great.

850
00:42:28,753 --> 00:42:29,961
So that's how you
placate someone

851
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,583
when you think their
idea's terrible.

852
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:32,550
What?

853
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:34,897
No, I don't do that.

854
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,795
I wouldn't do that.
That's not me.

855
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:39,453
Well what's your film about?

856
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:47,772
Dane tells me it's
about a phoenix

857
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:53,225
rising from the ashes
of his grief.

858
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,538
I'm sure it'll be great.

859
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,402
Hey, can we get one more?

860
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,990
- You can't yell.
- Why?

861
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:00,750
You're too famous to yell.

862
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:02,959
It's rude.
Okay, I'm sorry.

863
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:04,409
He broke up with us.

864
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:06,066
We don't need that guy.
You know why?

865
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:07,826
'Cause when you are
famous, when you're famous,

866
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:09,690
they put like a little gift
basket when you show up

867
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:11,761
and there was a bottle of
whiskey in mine

868
00:43:11,899 --> 00:43:14,350
and I'm also like super
hot, well adjusted.

869
00:43:14,488 --> 00:43:17,008
So I go to therapy. So let's go.

870
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:18,250
Okay. Okay.

871
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:20,287
I had a jacket.

872
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:21,978
Where is my?
Yeah.

873
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:04,193
Up and at 'em.
Registration's in 45 minutes.

874
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:05,470
Where's Lucy?

875
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,128
Seriously, where's Lucy?

876
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:10,889
She was at the MSP party.

877
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:16,032
I thought you
were chaperoning.

878
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:19,208
- Hello?
- Lucy. Hi.

879
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:20,588
Where are you?
Just kidding.

880
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:21,935
This is Lucy's voicemail.

881
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:22,936
Leave a message-
Why are you

882
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:24,662
so fucking useless?

883
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:35,776
- Lucy?
- Hey.

884
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:39,711
Yeah, fuck, where are you?

885
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:42,231
The garden of Eden.
I believe.

886
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:43,646
It's so be beautiful

887
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:44,958
here, Cleo.
So we need to get you

888
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:46,511
to the top of the face in
30 minutes

889
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:47,581
so that you can compete.

890
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,583
So can you tell me where you are

891
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:51,067
so that I can come get
you please.

892
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:53,518
Bliss. I'm in Bliss!

893
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,177
Can you tell me
where Bliss is?

894
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:08,326
Get in!

895
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:11,156
You found me!

896
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,089
This is Nick.

897
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:15,643
Short for Nicholas.

898
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:18,163
- Hi, Nicholas!
- Bye, Nicholas.

899
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:19,958
Lucy, get in the van.

900
00:45:21,442 --> 00:45:23,582
You're going in.

901
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:26,585
Can we put some music on?

902
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,104
- No, no, no, no.
- How high are you right now?

903
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,003
Yes!

904
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:31,452
You know you have to compete
in like 15 minutes, right?

905
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,868
I cannot wait.

906
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:34,973
You're gonna crush it, babe.

907
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:36,457
Thank you. Aw.

908
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,220
Fuck. Ross is gonna kill me.

909
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,121
You smell like
a lot of things.

910
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:47,537
Only because I
drank 78 drinks last night

911
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:50,333
and woke up in Gabe Paul's
hotel room.

912
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:51,334
Shut up!

913
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:54,027
What?

914
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:56,305
I also woke up fully
clothed on top of the covers

915
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:58,652
because we're just friends.

916
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:02,829
Maybe he was being chivalrous.

917
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,140
He was being

918
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:10,077
whatever.

919
00:46:10,215 --> 00:46:10,906
Lucy.

920
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:14,461
Watch, watch, watch.

921
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,156
Hey, question.

922
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:22,434
How much purpose do you think
ski movies we should have?

923
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,815
Really?

924
00:46:23,953 --> 00:46:25,679
No, I'm just talking
range wise.

925
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:27,715
Like are we, are we talking
bifurcation of consciousness

926
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:29,165
or like subverting the male gaze

927
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:31,029
or is it just like women
can wear pink

928
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,962
and go skiing and have fun
and that's-

929
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,517
Cleo! Just go
with your gut.

930
00:46:36,655 --> 00:46:39,141
You make that sound so simple.

931
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:40,107
Where are your skins?

932
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:41,522
I don't need skins.

933
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,284
You definitely
need skins.

934
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:46,320
I'm a snow leopard.

935
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:47,805
No fucking up.

936
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,497
She's helping you.

937
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:52,050
I don't have time for this.

938
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:54,225
Oh, you don't have time
for this, but we all do?

939
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:55,364
Well, considering the movie
was supposed

940
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:56,986
to solve all of our problems.

941
00:46:57,124 --> 00:47:00,403
Yeah, I'd say it's pretty
high priority.

942
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:04,960
Shit.

943
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:09,861
I love your braid.

944
00:47:16,903 --> 00:47:18,421
I always thought it was
so unoriginal

945
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,493
for skier girls to have braids.

946
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,427
Yours is fucking stunning.

947
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:25,428
Show pony.

948
00:47:27,983 --> 00:47:31,089
Can you not? And maybe
gimme some space.

949
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:35,335
I can respect that
boundary that you're setting.

950
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,279
Where's the ground?

951
00:47:50,177 --> 00:47:51,765
Where's the ground?

952
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,700
Seriously, kind of
freaking out. Where is it?

953
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,461
Is this going faster than usual?

954
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:02,189
I need to get off this thing.

955
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:04,743
Oh, my arm.

956
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,504
Oh, wow. My tongue.

957
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,438
I'm cotton mouthing.

958
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:11,129
Are you gonna be okay?

959
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:15,237
Like spiritually,
physically, emotionally?

960
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,411
It's all connected to my dad.

961
00:48:20,104 --> 00:48:20,932
Oh.

962
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:24,073
Oh, fuck. Good lord.

963
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:26,904
No, no, no, no.

964
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:30,148
No, no. No, no, no.

965
00:48:30,286 --> 00:48:31,115
Oh.

966
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:35,188
Ah!

967
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:43,886
You guys are welcome
to come in.

968
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:45,267
Is she okay?

969
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,234
She'll be fine.

970
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:48,442
She's severely dehydrated

971
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,823
so we have her on an IV drip

972
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:52,343
while the drugs leave
her system.

973
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:54,862
She had a panic attack.
It happens.

974
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:57,382
Thank you for fixing her up.

975
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,143
Is this a regular occurrence
for her?

976
00:48:59,281 --> 00:49:00,006
- No.
- Oh yeah.

977
00:49:00,144 --> 00:49:01,766
Definitely not.

978
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:04,182
Dude, I'm so embarrassed.

979
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:08,152
This is like the least
embarrassing thing.

980
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,360
Oh, it is.

981
00:49:09,498 --> 00:49:12,087
My liver's fucked, apparently.

982
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:14,986
Well, pretty sure they're
replaceable.

983
00:49:15,124 --> 00:49:17,092
You're human, sweetie.

984
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,783
Yeah, totally.

985
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:20,095
No one caress that you
basically fucked up

986
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:22,373
the entire shoot today.

987
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:24,030
What?

988
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:25,686
You've been freaking
out about it all day.

989
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:27,067
- Freaking out?
- Yes.

990
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:28,862
More like,
have I been demonstrating

991
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,175
a super-human level of
responsibility for all of us?

992
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:32,383
Sure, I'll take that on.

993
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:33,487
I'll own that.

994
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,144
- Responsibility?
- Yes.

995
00:49:35,282 --> 00:49:37,353
Your version of responsibility
looks a lot like selfish

996
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:38,458
to me.
Selfish?

997
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:39,838
- Yes.
- Me? I?

998
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,495
- Okay guys, chill.
- You.

999
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:42,634
I've been working my off
while you two run around

1000
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:43,946
like a couple of juiced-up

1001
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:45,327
frat boys.
Working your a...

1002
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:46,293
Are you...?

1003
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:48,330
Get over yourself, Cleo.

1004
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:49,814
Can we get outta here?

1005
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,298
Is she insane?

1006
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:08,143
So, turns out Pirates of
the Baberian isn't a pirate.

1007
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:10,145
He was that doctor.

1008
00:50:10,283 --> 00:50:13,700
Wait, that was Pirates of
the Baberian?

1009
00:50:15,633 --> 00:50:16,875
Hey, Lucy.

1010
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,705
He doesn't look
a pirate at all.

1011
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:20,500
I think you owe the
pirate community an apology.

1012
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:23,537
Oh, I owe a lot of people
an apology.

1013
00:50:23,675 --> 00:50:25,781
I shit myself in the tram.

1014
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:31,925
Wait, like actually
shit yourself?

1015
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,926
Yeah.

1016
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,893
So that was chill.

1017
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,965
Then I barfed and then I barfed
again on hot pirate-doctor.

1018
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:43,454
Maybe he didn't notice.

1019
00:50:43,592 --> 00:50:45,697
He brought me a fresh
pair of pants.

1020
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,458
I think I got his attention.

1021
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:51,910
Are you serious?

1022
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:04,751
Hey, I don't know if
I can take

1023
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,649
one of these parties sober.

1024
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:08,065
Well, I mean,

1025
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:12,276
we're just going for
the free food.

1026
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:13,967
Tomorrow night's the big night

1027
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:17,833
with the awards screening
gala thing or whatever.

1028
00:51:17,971 --> 00:51:19,317
I think tonight should
be mellow.

1029
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:20,422
Shh. Don't say that.

1030
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,250
You'll jinx It.

1031
00:51:21,388 --> 00:51:22,941
True, actually.

1032
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,635
Smash cut to you doing
body shots off pro skiers?

1033
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:27,670
- Yes.
- No.

1034
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:32,951
What's up Cleo?

1035
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,541
Pete, you are actually
just the guy I wanna see.

1036
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:40,027
How much purpose do you
think ski movies should have?

1037
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:41,581
Be- because they can't be
pointless,

1038
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:43,169
but they also can't be
contrived.

1039
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:45,585
'Cause it's like, you
know, these metaphors,

1040
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:48,484
like this lifecycle of water
and then shots of skiing.

1041
00:51:48,622 --> 00:51:51,108
Like I just, the connection
feels so over the top.

1042
00:51:51,246 --> 00:51:53,179
But then shredding and having
a good time's not enough.

1043
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:57,183
So I don't know.

1044
00:51:58,494 --> 00:51:59,599
Oh, hey guys.

1045
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,188
No? Okay.

1046
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,132
Club soda!

1047
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:17,582
Fuck.

1048
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:31,078
It's not like 0011
but it's 1100.

1049
00:52:32,873 --> 00:52:33,702
Hey.

1050
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:37,050
You guys aren't professional
athletes, are you?

1051
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:43,056
Well, thank God.

1052
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:44,402
What do you guys do?

1053
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,301
Oh, we have a, a startup.

1054
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:49,131
We're up here for the
weekend from the Valley.

1055
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:52,134
Just the boys,
shredding the gnar.

1056
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:54,688
- Hi.
- Hi.

1057
00:52:54,826 --> 00:52:56,483
Can we buy you a
beverage of your choice?

1058
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:58,209
Uh, not tonight, boys.

1059
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:01,108
Striking out.

1060
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:03,387
Let's go back to the chalet.

1061
00:53:03,525 --> 00:53:04,353
Chalet.

1062
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,567
Do what you gotta do.

1063
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:12,810
I'm gonna be a while.

1064
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:15,088
Decisions are hard for me.

1065
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,334
Somehow convince the
fucking park service

1066
00:53:19,472 --> 00:53:21,543
to let me go on the top of
Mount Rainier.

1067
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,649
And I had this idea that
I was going

1068
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:29,896
to paraglide down one
of the glaciers, but...

1069
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:35,142
Hey are, are you Chloe Brown?

1070
00:53:37,386 --> 00:53:39,561
Scott Gaffney. I'm the
guest judge this year.

1071
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:41,770
Just wanted to introduce
myself to all the filmmakers.

1072
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:43,323
Oh, fuck.
You're the guest judge?

1073
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:45,049
Yes, I, I am.

1074
00:53:45,187 --> 00:53:46,706
So what's your film about?

1075
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:49,709
I've heard a lot of really
cool concepts this year.

1076
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:50,710
Um.

1077
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:57,234
Uh, women. Um...

1078
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,099
I'm sure it'll be great.

1079
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,584
Good to meet you.

1080
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:03,481
- Scotty, motherfucker.
- Hey, buddy.

1081
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:04,793
How are you, dude?

1082
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:05,932
Good to see you.
What's going on?

1083
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:06,760
You fucking savage. Come on.

1084
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:08,314
You did.
I know.

1085
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:09,763
Can I buy you a drink?
You buying me a drink?

1086
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:11,178
Fucking A, let's do it.
Let's do it.

1087
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:12,594
The standard OGs.
What's up Paul?

1088
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:14,112
Spike?

1089
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,459
Gaffney, what are you having?

1090
00:54:15,597 --> 00:54:16,770
Uh, Kolsch.

1091
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:19,117
Kolsch. Two Kolschs.

1092
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,947
Sweet. Thanks, man.

1093
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:22,673
Put 'em on his tab.
I'm just fucking with you.

1094
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:24,330
No, put 'em on min.

1095
00:54:29,404 --> 00:54:32,303
Okay.

1096
00:54:33,994 --> 00:54:37,619
You're almost a worst
cliche than I am.

1097
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,586
What cliche is that?

1098
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,141
Sad girl.

1099
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:49,734
Want some privacy?

1100
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:54,256
Um...

1101
00:54:57,742 --> 00:54:58,605
Um, yes

1102
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,263
or um, no?

1103
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:11,860
Are you just like
naturally insanely athletic

1104
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:13,379
or do you like go to the gym

1105
00:55:13,517 --> 00:55:15,519
and work really hard
to achieve your goals?

1106
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:17,590
Because it's a very important
distinction.

1107
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,350
What do you mean? Skiing?

1108
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,179
I dunno, I just ski.

1109
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,871
Annoying.

1110
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:24,079
Can I have a sip of that?

1111
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:26,771
Oh. No,
I need this whole thing.

1112
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:35,746
I had a nice time last night.

1113
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:37,541
You did?

1114
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:45,894
You okay?

1115
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:48,897
Yeah, I mean, I spent
the better part of the day

1116
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:51,209
stressing about whether
or not my ideas are stupid

1117
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,453
because some drunk pro
skier told me

1118
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:55,213
that they were last night, so.
What the fuck

1119
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,906
do you care what I say?

1120
00:55:58,044 --> 00:55:59,804
Because you're you.

1121
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:06,570
Come on.

1122
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,226
No pep talks.

1123
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,952
No, no pep talks.

1124
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,387
Interesting.

1125
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:34,218
Well there's this something.

1126
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:35,909
What, you got your period?
I don't care.

1127
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,947
No, not that, but,
well good for you.

1128
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:40,949
It's just that I've been
living in a van

1129
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:42,744
and at this time we don't
really have

1130
00:56:42,882 --> 00:56:44,918
like a process around showering

1131
00:56:45,056 --> 00:56:47,473
or really basic hygiene
in any way.

1132
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:48,784
And this rash cream
like exploded-

1133
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:50,199
You're so fucking hot.

1134
00:56:50,337 --> 00:56:52,685
Am I? I mean,
that feels generous.

1135
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:53,686
Oh God.

1136
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:58,656
And I've been in my
ski gear a lot and hiking

1137
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,728
and it's been a lot of
chicken nuggets diet wise.

1138
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:03,247
I just feel like I probably
don't smell

1139
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:05,111
that good-
Cleo.

1140
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:06,699
Shut the fuck up.

1141
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,012
Okay. No problem.

1142
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,301
That's not you.

1143
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,649
Totally bro. It's Eileen Gu.

1144
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:30,239
Seriously though,
you can teach us?

1145
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,591
Want me to grab it?

1146
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:38,247
Grab what?

1147
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:40,215
Ooh, that's naughty.

1148
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:44,875
Okay. Stop, stop, stop.

1149
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:46,463
I gotta go.

1150
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:47,464
No!

1151
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:51,813
- Where's my shit?
- Come on.

1152
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:54,401
No, let's just order some
room service for us, please.

1153
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,473
It's the final day of Hot Lapse.

1154
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:59,648
Yeah, and we should
spend it in bed

1155
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:02,479
eating shrimp cocktails

1156
00:58:02,617 --> 00:58:04,998
and having as much sex
as possible.

1157
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:06,862
Okay,
well I love that idea.

1158
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,036
- Me too.
- Like a lot.

1159
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:09,175
- Yeah.
- But...

1160
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:10,556
- No but!
- Rain check.

1161
00:58:10,694 --> 00:58:12,454
No, you're just gonna
leave right now?

1162
00:58:12,592 --> 00:58:14,525
Well, that story about me
living in a van with two girls

1163
00:58:14,663 --> 00:58:17,079
wasn't like a honey trap to
tantalize you.

1164
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:19,910
Well it worked.

1165
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:21,774
I can really use that
prize money.

1166
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:22,844
And by use I mean need.

1167
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:23,845
So bye.

1168
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:28,781
What?

1169
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:31,887
What?

1170
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:37,168
That face you made
when I mentioned winning.

1171
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:38,238
W- what?

1172
00:58:38,376 --> 00:58:40,206
You don't think I can?

1173
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:42,380
That's not what I...

1174
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,450
It isn't?

1175
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,523
N- no, it's just, it's just,

1176
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:49,526
it's a really hard
contest to win.

1177
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:53,599
Wow.

1178
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:56,567
Cleo.

1179
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:09,235
Unbelievable, oh! Fuck.

1180
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,454
Ready?

1181
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:22,386
- Oh, man.
- Epic.

1182
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:23,836
- Great.
- Epic.

1183
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:27,322
It's gonna be a beauty
day up there boys.

1184
00:59:33,397 --> 00:59:34,398
Yeah. Shoot.

1185
00:59:40,128 --> 00:59:41,612
Sorry, dog.

1186
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,476
Okay boys, let's go.

1187
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:44,304
Yes.

1188
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:55,005
Go for Tina.

1189
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:56,454
Tina. Fuck, where are you?

1190
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,525
Needed you here like 15
minutes ago.

1191
00:59:58,664 --> 01:00:01,494
Yeah,
I'm an hour east of Reno.

1192
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:03,634
So...
What? Why?

1193
01:00:04,808 --> 01:00:06,257
I'm at a craft beer expedition

1194
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:09,709
with our new best bartender
friend, Jill?

1195
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,091
Actually, I made that up.

1196
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:13,471
I don't know her name.
She's in the bathroom.

1197
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,059
But don't worry,
you got this girl.

1198
01:00:15,197 --> 01:00:16,302
No I don't.

1199
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:21,687
You fucking hung up on
me?!

1200
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:24,690
Fine.

1201
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,553
You know what? I don't need
skiers to make a ski movie.

1202
01:00:26,692 --> 01:00:28,176
I'll just film you idiots
flirting with boys.

1203
01:00:28,314 --> 01:00:30,868
Give the people what they want.

1204
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,567
Yeah,
I mean he is coming back.

1205
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:42,535
I can see some of the
old athlete in there,

1206
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:45,124
but he's got some
competitiveness

1207
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:47,505
and some hesitation.
Whoa!

1208
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,235
Who was that?

1209
01:00:53,373 --> 01:00:55,513
Huh? I don't know.

1210
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,894
Just a nobody.

1211
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,517

1221

Team Afterparty.

1222
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:12,936
It's one word.

1223
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:17,043
Uh, you were looking a
little sluggish this morning.

1224
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:18,976
I was worried about you.

1225
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:20,184
- Were you?
- Uh-huh.

1226
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:21,841
Sounds awful.

1227
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:26,156
You know, I can't wait
to see your little movie.

1228
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,332
Who knows.
Maybe you're the next me.

1229
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:34,612
Ugh. I can only dream
of having a fan base

1230
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,890
of tasteless middle-aged men

1231
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,477

1232
01:02:37,615 --> 01:02:40,549
non-threatening housewife

1234
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,450
when anybody offers you
$5 to direct anything.

1235
01:02:44,588 --> 01:02:47,142
Five bucks.
Is that all you're making?

1236
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,626
You should charge more, Dane.

1237
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,973

Hey, glad you made it.

1257
01:03:39,643 --> 01:03:41,058
This party's sick.

1258
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:43,440
So is finishing Hot Lapse
all by myself.

1259
01:03:43,578 --> 01:03:45,235
What?

1260
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:47,064
I thought you'd at least
check in when you got back.

1261
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:50,136
The party was already on.

1262
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:51,482
Do you even give a shit

1263
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,519
that our film was due 20
minutes ago?

1264
01:03:53,657 --> 01:03:55,279
Yeah. Did we get it in?

1265
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:56,487
I got it in.

1267
01:03:58,558 --> 01:04:00,767

What the hell?

1269
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,875
Lucy's here too?

1270
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:06,359
Chill.

1271
01:04:06,497 --> 01:04:09,017
We're just having a good time.

1272
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:10,743
While I hustle my ass off

1273
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,227
trying to win this stupid
competition

1274
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:15,644
so we're not fucking homeless
next week.

1275
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,647
Why are you being like this?

1276
01:04:18,785 --> 01:04:20,408
I don't know, Tina.

1277
01:04:20,546 --> 01:04:22,030
How should I be when my
two best friends bail on me

1278
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:23,721
on the most important
weekend of my life?

1279
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,378
Bail on you?

1280
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:26,793
If it weren't for me,

1281
01:04:26,932 --> 01:04:29,417
you wouldn't even be in
this thing.

1282
01:04:29,555 --> 01:04:32,938
Because you inspired me to
apply or...?

1283
01:04:34,456 --> 01:04:35,872
Just forget it.

1284
01:04:37,528 --> 01:04:40,497
Because you pulled
some strings?

1285
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:42,223
Seriously?!

1286
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:45,882
It was a string, but yes,
I pulled it.

1287
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,711
Well, what did you expect?

1288
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:49,747
That you'd magically get in
without actually applying?

1289
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,370
I followed up Cleo.

1290
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:53,959
As one does actually
want something in life.

1291
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:55,546
You fucking lied.

1292
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,929
Fuck off, man.

1295
01:05:15,014 --> 01:05:17,154
She's not answering any
of my texts.

1296
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,329
It's Cleo. She'll be fine.

1297
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:21,365
I went a little hard.

1298
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,301
She's just having a midlife,
but not like the fun kind.

1299
01:05:26,439 --> 01:05:28,441
What's up, Palisades Tahoe?

1300
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:33,688
Welcome to Hot Lapse.

1301
01:05:35,759 --> 01:05:37,140
I am Donovan Banks.

1302
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:39,107
So we have a crazy
lineup of films tonight,

1303
01:05:39,245 --> 01:05:40,350
you guys should be stoked.

1304
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:44,147
Hold on, hold on.

1305
01:05:44,285 --> 01:05:45,355
I say we crank this
party up a notch, yeah?

1306
01:05:49,393 --> 01:05:51,292
Tommy, we doing Antarctica
this year or what?

1307
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,432
- You bet we are.
- Yeah.

1308
01:05:59,714 --> 01:06:03,580
You got them first big
premier jitters, huh?

1309
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:06,203
Well, there's nothing like it.

1310
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,172
Hands down, it's either the best

1311
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,381
or worst night of your life.

1312
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:14,867
A local legend himself,
Scott Gaffney.

1313
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:26,465
Three-minute warning for
Warren Miller.

1314
01:06:26,603 --> 01:06:29,019
Uh-oh. Heavy hitters are up.

1315
01:06:32,747 --> 01:06:34,921
Mosley,
you gonna say hi or what?

1316
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,615
We used to date a lot of
the same women.

1317
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,314
- Sherpa Cinema. Two minutes.
- Thank you.

1318
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:51,524
Still just
stoked that I was all good

1319
01:06:51,662 --> 01:06:54,079
and could shred another line
the next day.

1320
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:56,012
Kind of imagine it being like,
you know,

1321
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:59,429
like fucking
Russel Crow "Gladiator."

1322
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:01,707
Like that killer instinct.

1323
01:07:01,845 --> 01:07:03,398
You know what I'm saying?

1324
01:07:03,536 --> 01:07:04,572
Without further ado,
let's bring out a director

1325
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,194
we all know and love

1326
01:07:06,332 --> 01:07:08,231
back after a three-year
hiatus from Hot Lapse.

1327
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:11,096
You know its all
bullshit, right?

1328
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:12,476
You're up. Let's go.

1329
01:07:12,614 --> 01:07:16,170
Dane Blake.

1330
01:07:18,586 --> 01:07:19,518
Uh, look.

1331
01:07:20,726 --> 01:07:23,039
Hey, seriously, if you bomb,

1332
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:28,768
it's totally cool because
nobody knows who you are.

1333
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:31,047
Good luck.

1334
01:07:32,117 --> 01:07:32,979
All right.

1335
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:40,125
Yeah.

1336
01:07:42,368 --> 01:07:44,474
It is great to have you back
from LA dude.

1337
01:07:44,612 --> 01:07:47,477
Oh, well,
it's great to be back, bro.

1338
01:07:47,615 --> 01:07:49,962
Just wanna say it's so,

1339
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,308
it means so much and
it's so sick

1340
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:53,069
to see all this new talent.

1341
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:56,762
You know, just like, feel
the stoke, good vibes only.

1342
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,971
And I gotta say something else,
all right.

1343
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:02,906
LA has got nothing on the
realists of this town.

1344
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:05,322
Oh, yeah.

1345
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,392
Screw LA!

1346
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:13,779
So tell us about your
film, man.

1347
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:16,195
My piece tonight is about

1348
01:08:19,957 --> 01:08:20,751
truth?

1349
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:21,752
Truth.

1350
01:08:22,788 --> 01:08:26,412
My boy Gabe, y'all might
know him.

1351
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:27,793
Where is he? Where he at?

1352
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:29,070
Oh, there is.

1353
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,521
Give it up for Gabe. Come on.

1354
01:08:31,659 --> 01:08:33,281
One of the most beautiful
human beings

1355
01:08:33,419 --> 01:08:34,869
I've ever met in my life.

1356
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:38,838
And, um, my boy Gabe, has
had a rough couple years.

1357
01:08:41,186 --> 01:08:44,050
We wanted to explore
pain and joy,

1358
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:48,400
darkness and, and light,

1359
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:50,195
death and rebirth.

1360
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,679
And I'll tell you
something that, you know,

1361
01:08:51,817 --> 01:08:53,336
these are, these are concepts

1362
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:55,338
that a lot of athletes out there

1363
01:08:55,476 --> 01:08:57,409
that they're too afraid,
they're,

1364
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:59,031
they don't have the, the depth

1365
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,757
to explore these kind of things.

1366
01:09:00,895 --> 01:09:04,036
But not Gabe 'cause Gabe
is like, um,

1367
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:07,936
he's just Gabe.

1368
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,185
I'll stop talking.

1369
01:09:15,323 --> 01:09:16,428
Love you, bro.

1370
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:22,365
Ladies and gentlemen from
the living legends themselves

1371
01:09:22,503 --> 01:09:25,471
with their,
with their offering tonight,

1372
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:27,301
simply titled "Gabe."

1373
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,521
Oh my God.

1374
01:09:49,012 --> 01:09:51,394
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Shh.

1375
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,928
Cleo Brown. Two minutes.

1376
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:51,937
Boo! Boo.

1377
01:10:56,597 --> 01:10:58,840
That, that was brilliant.

1378
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,090
Sometimes the truth
has to cost.

1379
01:11:08,954 --> 01:11:10,093
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1380
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,579
Thanks.

1381
01:11:13,717 --> 01:11:15,098
Oh, one more time for
Dane, guys.

1382
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:29,008
Oh, shit.

1383
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:36,982
Okay, moving on to our final
contestants of the evening.

1384
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,848
Really, you could call
on the underdogs it-

1385
01:11:40,986 --> 01:11:42,988
Team Afterparty.

1386
01:11:43,126 --> 01:11:44,541
Oh, oh man, um.

1387
01:11:46,992 --> 01:11:48,338
I'm sorry folks.

1388
01:11:48,476 --> 01:11:51,376
It looks like Team
Afterparty is a scratch.

1389
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,689
- Boo!
- I know, I know.

1390
01:11:54,827 --> 01:11:57,865
Uh, maybe a little too
much pre-party, huh?

1391
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,221
I hate that I'm here.

1392
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:16,366
Come on. Inside.

1393
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:18,782
Like what was I thinking?

1394
01:12:32,175 --> 01:12:36,731
♪ You know my heart's where
it belongs ♪

1395
01:12:37,698 --> 01:12:39,424
Grilled cheese for breakfast?

1396
01:12:39,562 --> 01:12:43,635
Breakfast was pancakes. This
is a late afternoon snack.

1397
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:44,774
Blueberry?

1398
01:12:47,432 --> 01:12:48,950
You're kicking me out,
aren't you?

1399
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:51,919
Your crew dropped off
the van this morning.

1400
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:53,023
They did?

1401
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:56,820
Astonishingly clean.

1402
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,547
Weird. I wonder who they paid.

1403
01:12:59,685 --> 01:13:00,893
Do they hate me?

1404
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:02,308
First question I asked.

1405
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:04,310
Shut up, Ross.
I'm vulnerable right now.

1406
01:13:07,555 --> 01:13:09,557
They found a house.

1407
01:13:09,695 --> 01:13:10,834
Yeah, right.

1408
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:12,457
That's what they said.

1409
01:13:12,595 --> 01:13:15,736
In one morning, without
me? That's impossible.

1410
01:13:15,874 --> 01:13:16,944
Here, I'll take you there.

1411
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:18,532
'Kay, but wait.

1412
01:13:20,016 --> 01:13:21,258
Can we share custody of Buster?

1413
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,570
- No.
- But he loves me.

1414
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:23,916
No.

1415
01:13:24,054 --> 01:13:24,952
Buster,
do you wanna live with me?

1416
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:26,954
Stop. Don't answer that.

1417

1421
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:17,591
Hey!

1422
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:21,940
Hey. What's going on here?

1423
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:25,530
Savage, right?

1424
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:28,912
There's an ice luge party
at staff accomm tonight.

1425
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:29,913
Cool.

1426
01:14:31,087 --> 01:14:33,676
Go on in. Check the place out.

1427
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,475
You have a problem dude.

1428
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:45,308
Hey.

1429
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:49,864
How baller is this place, huh?

1430
01:14:50,002 --> 01:14:52,142
So we live here now?

1431
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,765
Yeah. Did Lucy tell you?

1432
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:55,387
She went cat skiing with
these tech guys

1433
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:57,113
and taught them how to 360

1434
01:14:57,251 --> 01:14:59,080
and now we're staying in
their winter rental till May.

1435
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:01,289
- That's-
- Amazing, right?

1436
01:15:01,427 --> 01:15:02,670
They're only here every
other weekend.

1437
01:15:02,808 --> 01:15:04,707
And we're like
their harem?

1438
01:15:04,845 --> 01:15:07,330
They're actually really nice
and super fun to party with.

1439
01:15:07,468 --> 01:15:08,952
Like all top-shelf liquor.

1440
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:10,747
Oh. Just what I need.

1441
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:12,369
You're gonna love them.

1442
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,095
Especially Kyle.

1443
01:15:14,233 --> 01:15:16,166
He's totally your type.

1444
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:18,514
Kind of fem.

1445
01:15:19,825 --> 01:15:21,344
Is that my type?

1446
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:22,345
Mm.

1447
01:15:24,485 --> 01:15:27,419
Oh hey. Sorry about last
night and everything.

1448
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:28,731
You doing okay?

1449
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:31,043
- Uh, I mean-
- Oh my gosh.

1450
01:15:33,218 --> 01:15:34,530
So hot.

1451
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:36,083
Wait, is that mine?

1452
01:15:36,221 --> 01:15:38,188
Can I get the ass cheeks out?

1453
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:39,086
Is it too much?

1454
01:15:39,224 --> 01:15:40,570
No such thing.

1455
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,952
Do it, okay, I'm gonna help you.

1456
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:44,436

01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:34,106
I'm getting crushed up there.

1471
01:16:34,244 --> 01:16:36,557
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I'm coming.

1472
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:37,558
Fuck.

1473
01:16:40,147 --> 01:16:41,666
- Oh, hey Cleo!
- Hey!

1474
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,644
Oh my God.
There's actually people here.

1475
01:16:54,782 --> 01:16:56,163
Wow.

1476
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:58,510
My mouth is so dry.

1477
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:01,064
Um, welcome to Vidiots.

1478
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:04,723
Where on Wednesdays we
watch amateur ski movies

1479
01:17:04,861 --> 01:17:06,173
made by normies like us.

1480
01:17:08,106 --> 01:17:10,695
I'm your host, Cleo
Brown, aka Vidiots girl.

1481
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:17,149
You know, I gotta say,
when I first moved to town,

1482
01:17:17,287 --> 01:17:18,806
I was like,
"This place is amazing.

1483
01:17:18,944 --> 01:17:20,843
You never have to grow up."

1484
01:17:20,981 --> 01:17:25,364
Now, decade later I'm like,
"Why are my roommates 22?

1485
01:17:27,988 --> 01:17:30,128
Why do I still have roommates?"

1486
01:17:30,266 --> 01:17:32,371
But that's ski towns.

1487
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:34,166
Full of people like me.

1488
01:17:34,304 --> 01:17:37,273
Stuck but always moving
across town.

1489
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:46,558
I've, I've had a, a big
few days and key takeaway,

1490
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:52,460
it's not the town that's
holding me back, it's me.

1491
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:54,600
I need to change.

1492
01:17:54,739 --> 01:17:56,188
Yeah, no, don't worry,
you guys don't have to

1493
01:17:56,326 --> 01:17:58,639
I know you hate that.

1494
01:17:58,777 --> 01:18:01,642
I made a thing for Hot
Lapse that I didn't show

1495
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:05,404
because turns out I have
crazy self-limiting beliefs

1496
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:07,683
and am a giant pussy.

1497
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:09,201
But also kind of,

1498
01:18:11,445 --> 01:18:15,863
fuck them you know?

1499
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:18,970
This, this movie was always
for you guys.

1500
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:21,800
And yes, it took an absolute
meltdown in the green room

1501
01:18:21,938 --> 01:18:23,422
in front of who I thought
were my heroes

1502
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,702
to realize that actually,
you all are.

1503
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:33,087
So I give you "The Nobodies."

1504
01:18:45,341 --> 01:18:46,549
This is awful.

1505
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:54,212
What's up? I'm Cleo
Brown and I am a nobody.

1506
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,661
Trust me.

1507
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,147
Just ask anybody that's
a somebody.

1508
01:18:58,285 --> 01:18:59,458
Watch this.

1509
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:01,460
Hey Daron. Hi.
Yeah?

1510
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:04,015
Can you be in my
Hot Lapse movie?

1511
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:05,810
Who are you?

1512
01:19:05,948 --> 01:19:07,018
- Sorry. Do I know you?
- What kinda camera is that?

1513
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:08,433
Oh, sorry.

1514
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:09,848
I don't even know if
I know you.

1515
01:19:09,986 --> 01:19:11,367
I got like,
I got a thing actually.

1516
01:19:11,505 --> 01:19:12,471
I've got a plumber coming
over later.

1517
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:14,059
Uh, I gotta pee.

1518
01:19:15,095 --> 01:19:16,165
I said no.

1519
01:19:16,303 --> 01:19:17,614
Well...

1520
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:24,414
Who me?

1521
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:26,037
Yeah. I'm a nobody.

1522
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:28,039
I'm Marty and I'm a nobody.

1523
01:19:28,177 --> 01:19:30,489
My name is Pete and
I'm a nobody.

1524
01:19:30,627 --> 01:19:33,009
My name is Betty and
thank God I'm a nobody.

1525
01:19:33,147 --> 01:19:35,149
Well actually it depends
on who you talk to.

1526
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:37,117
I am kind of a legend in
some parts.

1527
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:39,360
Unless you ask the guys
at the Wednesday races,

1528
01:19:39,498 --> 01:19:40,741
then you better watch out

1529
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:42,294
because that's where I've
taken this

1530
01:19:42,432 --> 01:19:43,986
for the last three years.

1531
01:19:44,124 --> 01:19:45,711
Oh, I'm definitely a nobody.

1532
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:48,024
That's the only way to
actually go skiing.

1533
01:19:48,162 --> 01:19:50,958
I hear if you're a pro,
you just stand around.

1534
01:19:51,096 --> 01:19:52,546
I thought about going pro,

1535
01:19:52,684 --> 01:19:54,582
but somebody's gotta park
the cars around here.

1536
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,860
My name's Krista.

1537
01:19:55,998 --> 01:19:57,862
I work in marketing here.

1538
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,208
I mean,
every time I'm out there,

1539
01:19:59,346 --> 01:20:01,037
it's another "pinch me" moment.

1540
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:02,832
Dude, I ended up
breaking my fib.

1541
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,973
Cost me my whole season.
I'm not a nobody though.

1542
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:07,526
Hey, Jerry.

1543
01:20:07,664 --> 01:20:08,873
Ready to get your kicked today?

1544
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:10,667
My brother,
he moved to Kansas City.

1545
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,531
I don't know if I could do
that city life.

1546
01:20:12,669 --> 01:20:14,637
He doesn't much like plowing
and thinks I'm crazy to do it,

1547
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:15,914
but takes care of the family.

1548
01:20:16,052 --> 01:20:16,846
I'm good with that.

1549
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,710
Take that, bitches!

1550
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:20,505
Any kind of part-time job
you can think of, I've done.

1551
01:20:20,643 --> 01:20:22,921
Especially if it's something
that works in the evening,

1552
01:20:23,059 --> 01:20:25,061
because then I can free
up my days to go skiing.

1553
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:26,097
I can clear a parking
lot with this thing

1554
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:27,857
in like two hours.

1555
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:30,687
So I've been a dog walker,
I've been a ski nanny.

1556
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,551
I've been a bartender.

1557
01:20:32,689 --> 01:20:34,036
You know, as much
as it hurt to fall on my ass,

1558
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,659
skiing is my favorite
thing to do.

1559
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:38,419
Depending on how nice you are,

1560
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:40,076
you have one to three chances
to date in a ski town.

1561
01:20:40,214 --> 01:20:41,526
It's just so small.

1562
01:20:41,664 --> 01:20:44,287
After that,
you're single for life.

1563
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:48,498
Pete,
you almost hit the tree.

1564
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:50,707
The tree almost hit me.

1565
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,986
Despite all
the changes,

1566
01:20:53,124 --> 01:20:55,091
what doesn't change is
the people,

1567
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:57,162
the community spirit and
the adventure.

1568
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,545
That will always hold us
all together.

1569
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:03,617
Wow.

1570
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:04,721
Yeah, had to get an extreme.

1571
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,930
Go fast, eat ass.

1572
01:21:06,068 --> 01:21:07,483
I moved here for the babes.

1573
01:21:07,621 --> 01:21:08,864
I'm not getting any babes.

1574
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:11,418
So now I'm here for the snow,
I guess.

1575
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:13,040
For the friendships.

1576
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:15,215
I lived in big cities
and I felt so alone,

1577
01:21:15,353 --> 01:21:17,493
but here I totally fit right in.

1578
01:21:17,631 --> 01:21:18,701
I wish I'd have been
able to grow up here,

1579
01:21:18,839 --> 01:21:19,944
but you know what?

1580
01:21:20,082 --> 01:21:21,738
I sure am glad my kids could.

1581
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,223
I think that's what's
different

1582
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:25,881
between like a city versus
the mountain.

1583
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:27,606
Everybody knows everybody.

1584
01:21:27,744 --> 01:21:32,025
Three generations of
families growing up together.

1585
01:21:32,163 --> 01:21:34,234
A big part of being in
the, in this community is,

1586
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:35,891
you know, giving back.

1587
01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:37,651
I give everything, you
know, I give it my all.

1588
01:21:37,789 --> 01:21:40,585
I help the kids with coaching
or you know, shoveling,

1589
01:21:40,723 --> 01:21:41,931
clearing people's driveways.

1590
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:43,415
Has anyone been
helping you

1591
01:21:43,553 --> 01:21:45,107
shovel while you've been hurt?

1592
01:21:45,245 --> 01:21:47,281
No. I, I think everyone's
just been really busy.

01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:53,563

1594

01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,266
They're passionate about
the mountains,

1598
01:22:06,404 --> 01:22:10,960
but they're even more passionate
about their community.

1599
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:13,652
Well, if this is being a nobody,

1600
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:16,310
then that's just fine with me.

1601
01:22:22,661 --> 01:22:24,525

Bar. Bar down.

1614
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:18,234
What a beautiful day.

1615
01:23:19,684 --> 01:23:20,892
Chilly though.

1616
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:24,861
You from here?

1617
01:23:25,862 --> 01:23:29,349
I have lived here for the
better part of a decade, yes.

1618
01:23:29,487 --> 01:23:32,248
Huh, what a great
place to live.

1619
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:36,011
I- I'm actually from the city.

1620
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,357
I always wonder what it
would be like

1621
01:23:37,495 --> 01:23:40,015
if I had stayed in a ski town.

1622
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,432
Well, I'll let you
know in about 30 years.

1623
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:46,228
Well, funny.

1624
01:23:46,366 --> 01:23:49,024
So what do you do for work here?

1625
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:50,853
I'm a filmmaker.

1626
01:23:50,991 --> 01:23:53,200
Really? Anything I would've
seen?

1627
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:54,167
Nope.

1628
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,757
Do you live here too?

1629
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:00,552
Me?

1630
01:24:01,484 --> 01:24:02,347
No.

1631
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,939
I'm just here checking
out the local talent.

1632
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:09,803
Wow.

1633
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:10,735
Okay. Okay.

1634
01:24:10,873 --> 01:24:12,150
You're still mad.

1635
01:24:12,288 --> 01:24:14,877
- Yep.
- Do you two know each other?

1636
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:16,741
Uh, yeah, you could say that.

1637
01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:20,227
Could we please have this
conversation up at the top?

1638
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:21,125
Please?

1639
01:24:44,734 --> 01:24:46,391
Would an "I'm sorry"
text have killed you?

1640
01:24:46,529 --> 01:24:48,013
I was so stupid

1641
01:24:48,152 --> 01:24:49,429
that I figured that you
would want some space.

1642
01:24:49,567 --> 01:24:50,844
Yeah, like a little.

1643
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:52,121
And I thought I was
gonna be able

1644
01:24:52,259 --> 01:24:54,503
to apologize properly at
Hot Lapse.

1645
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:57,506
Well, I decided to
self-sabotage instead. So.

1646
01:24:57,644 --> 01:24:59,473
I heard and I wanted to call

1647
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,890
and I, I would've called or
texted, but we're trash people.

1648
01:25:03,028 --> 01:25:04,064
We didn't even exchange numbers.

1649
01:25:04,202 --> 01:25:05,583
Well, you know my name,

1650
01:25:05,721 --> 01:25:06,687
I hope.
Come on.

1651
01:25:06,825 --> 01:25:07,757
You ever heard of a DM?

1652
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:08,620
What, like social media?

1653
01:25:08,758 --> 01:25:09,932
Like, like my-

1654
01:25:10,933 --> 01:25:13,280
my PR team handles all that.

1655
01:25:13,418 --> 01:25:15,800
- Oh, gross.
- Or they did, anyway.

1656
01:25:15,938 --> 01:25:17,595
I, no, I fired them.

1657
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:21,461
I fired everyone, actually.

1658
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:23,842
Like, everyone, everyone?

1659
01:25:24,947 --> 01:25:25,810
Yeah.

1660
01:25:27,812 --> 01:25:29,538
Seems kind of rash.

1661
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:32,403
Yeah, I don't know, it,

1662
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:33,818
feels pretty great.

1663
01:25:39,272 --> 01:25:40,894
So you just came skiing

1664
01:25:41,032 --> 01:25:42,827
hoping for a rom-com miracle?

1665
01:25:42,965 --> 01:25:43,828
Yeah.

1666
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:48,660
But after I found the van that
you're no longer living in

1667
01:25:48,798 --> 01:25:52,561
and after I had a beer with
Ross, who's such a gem,

1668
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:54,149
what a solid guy.

1669
01:25:55,943 --> 01:26:00,189
And then I, I discovered
your, your Vidiots girl,

1670
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:02,881
but it was the day after
your premiere

1671
01:26:03,019 --> 01:26:07,852
and, and I checked out that
real dump of a housing option.

1672
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,477
Good thing you're not
staying there.

1673
01:26:13,547 --> 01:26:18,552
And then I was just trudging
uphill in the snow both ways.

1674
01:26:18,759 --> 01:26:21,072
Just searching for you.

1675
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,763
After the carrier pigeons.
Come on.

1676
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:24,869
Stop, don't fall for this.

1677
01:26:25,007 --> 01:26:27,630
Please? Please fall for it.

1678
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,366
In my head I imagine that
conversation

1679
01:26:39,504 --> 01:26:42,058
going much differently.
Yeah, me too.

1680
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,301
Not that I was thinking about
or anything.

1681
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:45,993
No, no, no, no. Not you, no.

1682
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,031
So this is it, huh?

1683
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:52,068
Just a couple of unemployed
ski bums.

1684
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,691
Ski enthusiasts.

1685
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:54,899
Yeah. You can't say
that anymore.

1686
01:26:55,037 --> 01:26:56,935
Recreationalists.

1687
01:26:57,073 --> 01:26:58,592
But yeah.

1688
01:26:58,730 --> 01:26:59,559
I love it.

1689
01:27:02,665 --> 01:27:03,873
Where we going?

1690
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:05,599
You're asking me?

1691
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,706
I missed you.

1692
01:27:12,192 --> 01:27:13,055
Stupid.

1693
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,163
Yeah, Vidiots girl.

1694
01:27:18,302 --> 01:27:19,786
Get her done, woo!

1695
01:27:20,959 --> 01:27:23,548
- We going skiing?
- Yeah.

1696
01:27:23,686 --> 01:27:24,998
Come on.

1697
01:27:25,136 --> 01:27:27,621
