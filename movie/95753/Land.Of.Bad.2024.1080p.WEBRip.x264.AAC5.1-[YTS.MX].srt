3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,160
The loading operations are
finish, half ready for take-off.

4
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,480
There a problem, Sergeant?

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,600
No, sir...

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Sorry, I was just, uh--

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,920
Get your shit together.
We lift off in five.

8
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,720
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,120
Hey, you're HALO qualified, yeah?

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,920
HALO?

11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,600
No, sir.

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Are we doing a HALO jump?

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,440
You'll be fine.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
I'd go Fruit Loops.

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,840
My daughter loves them.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting. I repeat.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting.

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
Ah, fuck.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,800
Going after a CIA asset
that's been captured.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,480
The plan is to extract him
with minimal casualties.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,560
He was gathering intel on Alexander
Petrov, a Russian arms dealer

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,720
and former KGB.

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,120
What's up?

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
That your family?

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Nah, just a pic that came with the helmet.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,680
Yeah. Wife and kids.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,320
Nice.

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
Are those the new 5.11 tactical gloves?

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,480
You know the ones with the Kevlar knit?

30
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Yeah, yeah. Kevlar knit.

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,400
Awesome.

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
JTAC,

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400
just try to relax, okay?

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Right back the other way on
the Euro and gets that one to go.

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,680
And the whistle too...

36
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,360
That bad?

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Yeah, that bad.

38
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Do you wanna talk about it?

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Wanna hug?

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
We can hug.

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
You need me?

42
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,080
Yeah, I wanted to ask you something, but...

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,920
Okay. Coffee?

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,760
Sure.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
Okay.

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Yeah.

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Cool.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,160
So, uh,

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,120
you know the wedding's coming up, right?

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
Yes, I do. Twenty-third.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,280
That's right.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
You're not gonna change the date, are you?

53
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,760
What?

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,720
I've got everything organized.
I got the kids in place.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,720
I got the ex-wives in place.

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
- Lucy will be out of the hospital.
- Reaper.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm not going to change the date. I,

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,040
um, actually wanted to talk
to you about something else.

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,920
I wanted to ask--

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
Who moved my shit?

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,880
Airman...

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,400
who moved my shit?

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,040
Huh?

64
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,840
Coffee pods.

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,800
I-- I don't know, sir. I use the drip.

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Well, I can't trust a
word you say then, can I?

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
I take the time.

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,160
Every goddamn morning.

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
I do it

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
for efficiency,

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,400
easy recognition,

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,680
and organization.

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,480
Is it appreciated?

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,480
No.

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,600
It is respected.

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,200
I think not.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,480
But I do it

79
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
for the morale

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
of the squadron.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
You were saying?

82
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
Op starts in 15.

83
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
Yeah, yeah. I thought you
wanted to talk about something.

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,920
It can wait.

85
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Shit.

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,720
You lose something?

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,600
Ah, just my cereal.

88
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Your what?

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,680
Froot Loops.

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I had a box of Froot Loops. I
don't know what I did with it.

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
Jesus Christ, Air Force.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Barely started this op and you're already
sweating about a box of Frosted Flakes.

93
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,760
No, no. It was-- it was Froot Loops.

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
Huh?

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Froot Loops, not Frosted Flakes.

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,480
This kid for real?

97
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
Don't be an asshole.

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
That's cute.

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Thanks, man.

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,040
Fucking Fruit Loops.

101
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,040
How old are you, Air Force?

102
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
Twenty-seven.

103
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,280
Ah...

104
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,600
Bishop, how old's your
daughter now? Twenty?

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,280
You should set Air Force up on a date.

106
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah. I will shoot you in the
dick, Abell. I swear to God.

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,680
No, honey.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,360
I can't.

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
I can't come.

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,160
'Cause I gotta be here

111
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,520
at work. Yeah.

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,160
Look, just get your sister to go.

113
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
What about your mom?

114
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,320
All right. Well, why don't you call...?

115
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Oh, you called Judy? Uh...

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
look, okay, okay.

117
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,280
If it's only a couple
of things, that's fine.

118
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,480
That's fine. But right now, I gotta go

119
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
'cause I got a mission, yeah?

120
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,200
Zegler a little teardrop.

121
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,920
You know I don't like
that shot in college, right?

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,080
It's made about thirt-- yeah,

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,600
it's made about 37
percent of the time.

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,480
Fuck.

125
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Zegler just settled for a tough
floater on the first side of the floor.

126
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,080
Guys.

127
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
I got a favor to ask you.

128
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
My wife is pregnant.

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
While I'm on OP, if she goes into
labor, she's gonna call that phone.

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,760
All right?

131
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
You need to answer it,

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,720
and you need to come and get me.

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,920
Copy?

134
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Thank you very much.

135
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,800
And why don't we just keep
this volume down to a low level?

136
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,000
Because this is a
professional work environment.

137
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Now, now. Just because your team

138
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,280
delivered the biggest choke
in March Madness history,

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,800
doesn't mean the rest of
us can't still enjoy ourselves.

140
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,320
It's about Lucy. Virgil, it's important.

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,920
I know.

142
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Notice the, uh,

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
pseudofolliculitis

144
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
barbae hasn't

145
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
cleared up.

146
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Not yet, sir. No.

147
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,280
Well, you just let me know
when you're ready to shave.

148
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,160
I will, sir.

149
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,800
All right.

150
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
- Go, Vols!
- Go, Vols!

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,080
Warhawk, this is Blackbird
approaching drop zone.

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Headed to 15,000 feet.

153
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,600
Six minutes to the DZ.

154
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Winds are five knots and to the southeast.

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Skies are clear.

156
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,840
Happy hunting.

157
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
All right, boys. Six minutes.

158
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Here we go.

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,120
Fruit Loop, now's the time
to be checking your weapon.

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm good.

161
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,920
Not your Gameboy. Your actual weapon.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,120
Hey, look, I'm in
charge of the drone. So...

163
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,680
if we wind up in a
situation and I'm shooting,

164
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,240
we got big fucking problems.

165
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,640
You're not wrong.

166
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,360
You're not wrong. JTAC's only good for one
thing and that is... "Bringing the rain."

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
Is this your first mission
in theater, JTAC?

168
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,880
Second.

169
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
But first with operators.

170
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,240
What?

171
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Hell, I'll say it. Um...

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,440
we're about to head into a shit storm.

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
You still look like you kind of
need someone to wipe your ass.

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,720
So just... do me a favor.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,480
Keep up and don't fuck up.

176
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Last thing we need in this
op is to have to save your ass.

177
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
Nah, he's good.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Hey,

179
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
remember your training.

180
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,800
Talk to the planes.

181
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,560
When they start dropping bombs,
make sure it's on the bad guys.

182
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Yes, sir.

183
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,440
You're not going to need these.

184
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a sterilized op.

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
Be advised we are approaching--

186
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,400
All right, boys. Let's put our
masks on. Let's get to work.

187
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,360
Hey, JTAC,

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,120
this might sound stupid but
don't forget to breathe, yeah?

189
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Stay on your comms.

190
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
When that hits 3,000,

191
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
deploy your chute.

192
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,200
It's just the same as airborne,

193
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,160
only way fucking higher.

194
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Good to go.

195
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,840
I'll see you fuckers on the beach.

196
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
Yee-haw.

197
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,880
Hey,

198
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
walk in the park.

199
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,280
Fuck.

200
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,680
You good?

201
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

202
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
That ridge.

203
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,640
Four clicks by 0800.

204
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
Let's go. Let's move.

205
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,440
All right.

206
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,240
Sir,

207
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,200
Thank you, Miller.

208
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,560
Okay, team has landed.

209
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,440
Operators are en route.

210
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,160
The drone is ten mics
out from rendezvous point

211
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,560
and Warhawk is switching comms.

212
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,880
This carriage is about
to turn into a pumpkin.

213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,560
This is not my chair.

214
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Yes, it is.

215
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,840
No, it is not.

216
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,920
Oh, my god, Reaper, I
did not take your chair.

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,040
I know you didn't take my chair.

218
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,320
It will be these commie
assholes from Shadow Flight.

219
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,240
You finished?

220
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
No, I'm not.

221
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,520
Eat a bag of dicks.

222
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
Now I'm finished.

223
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,720
Okay.

224
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,880
All right, let's take
this lady to the dance.

225
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,400
Playboy 06, this is
Reaper 1-0 checking in...

226
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,760
You have 1 MQ-9 in the air.

227
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,480
1 by BLU 118 on board.
Eight hours of playtime ahead.

228
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,760
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy
0-6. Stand by for grid, over.

229
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
Roger. Standing by.

230
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Grid as follows,

231
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
…November, Victor,
7, Niner, 5-7-1-8.

232
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
That's a friendly grid.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,120
Roger, Playboy. I have
visual on friendly grid.

234
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,560
I am your eyes in the sky
and the bringer of doom.

235
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,520
Over.

236
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,600
Reaper is airborne.
Our location is confirmed.

237
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,720
What's the ordinance?

238
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
Two hellfire's and a BLUE-118, sir.

239
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
Lose the sir shit. I work for a living.

240
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,840
It's Sugar or Sug.

241
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,840
All right.

242
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,720
Makes him feel old.

243
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,640
He is old.

244
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
Thanks, Air Force.

245
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,120
Hey, JTAC.

246
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
What rock did they find you under?

247
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,880
In Guam on a training exercise.

248
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,600
Missed the flight out.

249
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,400
That was

250
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,920
nine hours ago.

251
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,920
How'd you miss the flight?

252
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,720
I had some stomach issues.

253
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Wait.

254
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,840
You're here 'cause you had the shits?

255
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,680
Well, I hope you got
that all cleared out.

256
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,120
You shit your pants on an op,

257
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,040
that stain will follow you for life.

258
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,880
Did you get briefed?

259
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,440
Yeah, but I'm a little confused.

260
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,280
What about?

261
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
Well, I'm not tier one.

262
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Yet he walks amongst us.

263
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
I thought operators don't go
out without tier one personnel.

264
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
We don't.

265
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
So why am I here?

266
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,920
A JSOC asset disappeared two weeks ago.

267
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,920
Believed to be kidnapped.

268
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,000
We've got intel on a possible locale.

269
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
So this is a rescue op?

270
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Potentially.

271
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,520
Ah.

272
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,840
You can never keep up
with these CIA spooks.

273
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,920
Either way... here we are.

274
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,800
So to answer your question...

275
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,400
no, you shouldn't be here.

276
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,640
And, yes,

277
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,920
Delta doesn't usually go out
without their tier one personnel.

278
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,840
And, yes,

279
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
if our guy is here,

280
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,840
then we'll go in and fucking get him.

281
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,880
Translation...

282
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
step up your game.

283
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,440
I need someone to cover.

284
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,600
Yeah.

285
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,160
I gotta check in with Lucy.

286
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
How's she doing?

287
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,480
She's fantastic.

288
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
Got the baby brain going on though.

289
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,120
I gotta repeat everything five times.

290
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,280
It's amazing.

291
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
Absolutely huge.

292
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,800
Got the same thing about this wedding.

293
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,120
Uh, it's understandable.

294
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,520
There's a lot of detail.

295
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
You think about it.

296
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,720
A wedding is probably the
greatest social ritual humanity has.

297
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
You know,

298
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,520
most important day of your life.

299
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,880
Might as well get it right.

300
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
You're only going to do it once.

301
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,920
Reaper, you've been married four times.

302
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
Yeah, that's just me though.

303
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm a romantic.

304
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
What did you want to ask me before?

305
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh, I--

306
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,880
Hold that thought.

307
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,440
Thank you, Miller.

308
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,080
Reaper.

309
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Hey, what's up?

310
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,360
Ah, this fucking frag is a pain in my ass.

311
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,200
Thought you got that patched up.

312
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,120
I did.

313
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,800
So why are you still bitching about it?

314
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,240
There's still a fucking
hole in my leg, asshole.

315
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
What happened?

316
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,320
I.E.D.

317
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Some kid triggered
it from half a click out.

318
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,920
We never stood a chance.

319
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,600
Therein lies the problem, Fruit Loop.

320
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,040
All this tech, it takes

321
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,680
the
human element out of warfare.

322
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,680
And what happens when all that shit fails?

323
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Well--

324
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,120
Well, what?

325
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,320
I don't know. I mean,

326
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I think this tech saves lives.

327
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,400
In a way, it's takes the
barbaric nature out of it.

328
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,640
Barbaric nature?

329
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Lipstick on a pig.

330
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,280
You really think you dropping a bomb on 50 people is any better than us shooting them in the head?

331
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,160
No.

332
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,600
No. War is barbaric.

333
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,360
It ain't never gonna fucking change.

334
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
It already has.

335
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,360
Listen up, Fruit Loop.

336
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,800
Let me tell you a story.

337
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,760
You can fight with all your robots and
your reapers and cell phones you want.

338
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,760
The end of the day,

339
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,800
when the technology fails

340
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,640
and all your--

341
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,440
your batteries and your bullets
and your bombs run out, you know,

342
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,400
and the fucking sun explodes,

343
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
war comes down to one very simple thing.

344
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,040
And that's man killing man.

345
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,920
Just takes one shit day to
change your whole perspective.

346
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,720
That's a fact.

347
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,760
Yeah.

348
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Welcome to the land of bad.

349
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
Fucking great story, man.

350
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,680
Really fucking good, rich and compelling.

351
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,480
What do you got?

352
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
I got movement.

353
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,520
Hundred meters.

354
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,400
Just the other side of those rocks.

355
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,520
I need eyes over that ridge.
Hundred meters northeast.

356
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,320
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy 0-6.

357
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,920
Got suspicious movement a hundred meters
northeast of our position. Can you check it out?

358
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,040
Roger that, Playboy. Standby.

359
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,480
Hundred meters southeast.

360
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,560
Got good handshake.

361
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Reaper 1-0, can you zoom in?

362
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,440
Copy that.

363
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Yeah, oh, that's sexy.

364
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
Pan left, 50 meters.

365
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Pan left, 50 meters.

366
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
What the fuck?

367
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,800
Reaper, I'm hollow, over.

368
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Roger. Standby.

369
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Systems malfunction.

370
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,520
Goddamn piece of shit.

371
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,120
Playboy, we have a systems
malfunction on the bird.

372
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,200
Copy that. Is the pod inop?

373
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,200
That is an a-firm, Playboy. We got
to get this piece of shit back to base.

374
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,800
Is another bird available?

375
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,800
That is a negative.

376
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,280
We'll fix this one up and
get it back to you stat.

377
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,480
Reapers down. No other UAV's available.

378
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,640
Broken Reaper, huh?

379
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,800
Ain't that some fuckin' irony?

380
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,560
Looks like we're gonna have to clear this ridge
the old-fashioned way. Abell, you're on point.

381
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,080
Copy.

382
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Bishop,

383
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,440
you're left.

384
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,600
Copy.

385
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,120
What's the rest of our air support?

386
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,320
Hornet's on standby. Thirty mikes out.

387
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,760
What do you want me to do?

388
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,360
Nothing.

389
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,080
I got nothing on my end.

390
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
Same here.

391
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,000
Looks clear.

392
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,200
Wait.

393
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,760
Wait, I've got movement.

394
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Ten meters.

395
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Oh, for fuck's sake.

396
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,640
It's a fucking oink oink.

397
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,080
What the hell's an oink oink?

398
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,160
A fucking pig, dumbass.

399
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,040
Pretty sure you got a
picture of her in your wallet.

400
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,800
Fucker.

401
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
This is serious bad guy lair shit.

402
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Got two tangos on the bridge.

403
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,120
A third on the far right.

404
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,360
Other side of the tent.

405
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,240
See a Starbucks down there?

406
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,520
I see number four on the
lower part of the S-bend road

407
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,360
Let's push down.

408
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
Okay. Clear.

409
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,320
Clear.

410
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,200
Okay. We're gonna call this OP1. Air Force,

411
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
set up up top.

412
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,560
Abell, you stay put.
Set up your hindsight.

413
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,200
Bishop, you're with me.

414
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,120
We're gonna wrap around southeast.

415
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,360
Hooah.

416
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,920
You good?

417
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah, I think so.

418
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,240
Okay. Go forth and conquer.

419
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,640
All right, gents.

420
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,760
Sit tight.

421
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,760
Call out what you see. want a head count
on that compound before we move on it.

422
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
Sug?

423
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
When can we get a nice gig in Hawaii?

424
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
Sick of swamp crotch.

425
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,920
I don't think they'd allow you
back in Hawaii since last time.

426
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
That was

427
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,640
one time.

428
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,160
Piece of shit. Fucking.

429
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,560
Got movement.

430
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,240
All right, this sure looks like our guy.

431
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
Bishop, can you confirm?

432
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,880
Yeah, that's Petrov all right.

433
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,160
Okay,

434
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
if he's here,

435
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,160
the asset's gotta be close.

436
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
Thunderbolt Squadron?

437
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,080
No, it's not.

438
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm sorry I can't do that for you.

439
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,640
You're gonna have to
call the operator back.

440
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,880
If you ask for extension 141,
that's Thunderbolt. Uh-huh.

441
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
Yeah, no problem.

442
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,920
Guys...

443
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,000
what the fuck?

444
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,640
What's the problem, Captain?

445
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
I asked you to keep an ear on this phone.

446
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,760
Some smartass turned
the goddamn ringer off.

447
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,040
Why don't you turn it back on?

448
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,120
I have

449
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Is your wife actually in labor, Captain?

450
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,680
On the precipice, sir.

451
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,920
Water's broken?

452
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,840
Impending.

453
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,840
Having any of those, uh,

454
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,840
contractions?

455
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,440
Well, since you asked,

456
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
right now,

457
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,040
40 mics apart.

458
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,880
Last night, she was tooting like

459
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,280
a bugler at a Gettysburg reenactment.

460
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,160
Currently, her cervix is

461
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,520
two centimeters dilated
and starting to yawn.

462
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
All right, that is too much information.

463
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,200
Yes, it is, sir.

464
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,640
Airmen, for the love of God,
make sure that phone's turned on.

465
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,120
Thank you.

466
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,520
Contact.

467
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,200
Multiple vehicles
inbound. Eleven o'clock.

468
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,640
Oh, Petrov is on the move.

469
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,160
Who the hell are these guys?

470
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,120
Identify yourselves!

471
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,880
Don't know.

472
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,800
Local militia?

473
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Kinda looks like Abu Sayyaf.

474
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Bishop, can you confirm?

475
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,480
Yeah, I can't tell.

476
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,280
More guys with guns.

477
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,200
Sure as shit ain't taking
this compound 'til they leave.

478
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,440
Check out the dude getting out
the left side of the lead vehicle.

479
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,200
Tell me that doesn't
look like Saeed Hashimi.

480
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,480
Fuck.

481
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,640
Who's that?

482
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,080
Head of Abu Sayyaf.

483
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Sure he's here to buy guns.

484
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
Keep your eyes open.

485
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
Guns on safety.

486
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,280
JTAC, what's the status of our air?

487
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,560
Reaper still down, Hornet on standby.

488
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
You want it airborne?

489
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,160
Negative.

490
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,520
Sit tight. Let me work
on a new game plan.

491
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,080
Yo,

492
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,200
drone's fixed.

493
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,560
Handover in five.

494
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,720
I'm ready.

495
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,160
Fuck.

496
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Playboy,

497
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,360
this is Reaper 1-0, back
on station. Checking in.

498
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,760
Requesting permission to establish overhead

499
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,720
Copy that. Good to have you back, Reaper.

500
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,800
Grid is as follows,

501
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,640
November, Victor,
1-1-4-8- 7-6-3-5. Over.

502
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,320
Copy grid, Playboy.

503
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,920
I have contact.

504
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,040
Open circular compound,
one large concrete structure,

505
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,360
and a road heading north crossing a dam.

506
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
Confirm target area.

507
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,240
Roger that, you have target area in sight.

508
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,120
I didn't know Hashimi
was in bed with Petrov.

509
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Oh, Hashimi's a terrorist.

510
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,400
He's got to buy his guns from somewhere

511
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,720
Come.

512
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,480
Come here.

513
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,920
The miss doesn't
look too thrilled about it.

514
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Yeah, this guy's definitely a creeper.

515
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,200
She's getting stranger
danger vibes for sure.

516
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,320
Hashimi and Petrov sitting in a tree

517
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,600
K-I-S-S...

518
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Fuck.

519
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,800
Go away!

520
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,360
Run! Run, run, run.

521
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,240
Oh, fuck.

522
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Take him!

523
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,520
Run!

524
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
What the fuck, Sugar?
What are we doing?

525
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,080
Warhawk, this is Alpha 1.

526
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,480
Have hostiles engaging with
civilians. Requesting updated

527
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,040
Make him see.

528
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,600
Allahu Akbar!

529
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,320
Fuck me.

530
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,320
Oh fuck...

531
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,520
Motherfucker!

532
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,520
Jesus Christ!

533
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
Petrov,

534
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,560
Papa!

535
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,240
Fuck this, Sugar, I ain't watching
this asshole lob off the kid's head.

536
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,160
Papa!

537
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,680
Kinney, stand by for
potential diversion.

538
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,080
Reaper, we need weapons effects
between the compound and the tent. Over.

539
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,160
Reaper 1-0. One by
hellfire missile, copied.

540
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
Papa!

541
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,240
Abell, Bishop, you got a shot, you
take it. Kinney, drop that fucking bomb.

542
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,800
Reaper, you are cleared hot!
Say again, you are cleared hot!

543
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,800
Copied.

544
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
Target acquired.

545
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,640
Weapon's away. Impact 30 seconds.

546
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,360
No! Papa!

547
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,480
Don't have thirty.

548
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Run!

549
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,800
Run, kid. Run!

550
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,560
Guys?

551
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,600
It's a fucking cave entrance.

552
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,120
Kinney, you've got hostiles directly below
you. Do not move. Do not even breathe.

553
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,040
Abell, Bishop,

554
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,760
I need sights on targets.

555
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Abell, you taking center. Bishop,
extreme left. I'm on extreme right.

556
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,520
On one...

557
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,320
In position.

558
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,760
On one.

559
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,840
Three

560
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,680
two,

561
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,720
one,

562
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
Kinney!

563
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,680
Fuck!

564
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,640
Shit. Abell, you've got five
hostiles on your six. Fifty meters.

565
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,560
Bishop, move. On me!

566
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
All right, Abell.

567
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,160
Kinney, I need...

568
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
Stay still, asshole.

569
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,200
A little help here, fellas!

570
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
Trying, buddy.

571
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,440
Kinney, I need you to lay
down some cover fire for Abell.

572
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,000
Sug...

573
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,520
Yeah.

574
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
We got a situation.

575
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,080
No shit.

576
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,160
We got another situation.
RPG twelve o'clock. Incoming!

577
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,800
Motherfucker!

578
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,320
Motherfucker!

579
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,080
I got you, man. I got you.

580
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,520
Okay.

581
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,520
You're good, man.

582
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,080
No, you're good, man. You're
good. You're good. I got you.

583
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,360
Where's the med kit?

584
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,480
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

585
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
Come on, man. Where's the med kit?

586
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,360
Kinney.

587
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Kinney.

588
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,760
Abell, Abell. No, no, no.

589
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,520
Fuck, fuck. Oh, fuck!

590
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,640
Abell is down. Abell is down.

591
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,760
Hello?

592
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,680
Oh, fuck.

593
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Oh, fuck. Alpha 1, this Playboy.

594
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,840
Kinney,

595
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,600
listen to me.

596
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,040
We are taking heavy fire
from two two-man RPG teams.

597
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,840
I need some bombs down there now!

598
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,640
Wait, wh-what about Abell?

599
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
Abell is dead.

600
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,520
He's dead. I need you to stay
focused, Sergeant. Get yourself together.

601
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,560
Oh, fuck.

602
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,760
Reaper, we're taking RPG fire on
the southeast side

603
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,360
of the compound. Two hundred
meters south of my position.

604
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,200
Give me the biggest
thing you got. Cleared hot.

605
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,560
Copy that, Playboy. We
have eyes on the target.

606
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,840
1 by Blu 118.

607
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Weapons away.

608
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
Impact 20 seconds.

609
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,520
Where's that bomb, Sergeant?

610
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,920
Twenty seconds!

611
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
RPG incoming!

612
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,840
Fuck! Sugar?

613
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,600
Sugar? Bishop!

614
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,200
Oh, shit.

615
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,280
Fuck!

616
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,200
You got eyes on him?

617
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,560
Lost him in the smoke.

618
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,560
Fuck.

619
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,680
Did he pop the smoke?

620
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,480
I don't know.

621
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,520
Playboy, do you copy?

622
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,400
I see him.

623
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,280
Stay with him.

624
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Reaper? Reaper, you there?

625
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,920
Reaper?

626
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
Reaper, you there?

627
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,160
We're here, Playboy.

628
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Give me the status of your team.

629
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,520
Uh,

630
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,120
KIA.

631
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,640
Okay, Playboy, let's

632
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,600
do this by the numbers.

633
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,920
Confirm your current grid location.

634
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,840
Yeah.

635
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,920
Uh,

636
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm headed northeast.
November, Romeo, 2-7-6- 0-niner-3-2-2.

637
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm, uh--

638
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,760
I'm approx

639
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,920
five clicks from the evac point.

640
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,440
I need you to scan forward 500
meters and make sure the area is clear.

641
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,840
Copy, Playboy. We got you.

642
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,080
Scanning forward 500 meters. Standby.

643
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah, area's clear.

644
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
Area looks clear. You're good to move.

645
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,360
Playboy, do you copy?

646
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,560
Playboy?

647
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,240
What's he doing? Is he moving?

648
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,320
He's freaking out.

649
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,040
You gotta calm him down.

650
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,680
Hey, Playboy. Good news.

651
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,200
Helicopter is inbound to the evac
point. The cavalry is on the way.

652
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,920
You gotta get your ass on the move, son.

653
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,760
You got to move, man. Let's go.

654
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,880
Come on, soldier.

655
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,520
Get up and go.

656
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,400
Here we go. All right.

657
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,320
You scan forward. I've got him.

658
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,480
Scanning forward.

659
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,800
Tell me what you see.

660
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,000
Reaper,

661
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,680
I think I'm hearing a truck.

662
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,600
He's right.

663
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,560
I have contact from the west.

664
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,880
Truck on the road, half a click.

665
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,800
I have contact from the east.

666
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,800
Looks like they're converging
on Playboy's position.

667
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,040
Playboy, be aware. You have
converging targets east and west.

668
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,680
How much ordinance do you have left?

669
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,080
One by hellfire. Air to
ground 114. Standing by.

670
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,920
You want those hornets airborne?

671
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,120
Negative.

672
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,360
Okay, Playboy, tally. Eyes
on target. What you want to do?

673
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,600
Keep eyes on it.

674
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,320
Roger that. Standing by.

675
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,680
Reaper, do you have eyes on hostiles?

676
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,760
Confirmed hostiles from the east are armed.

677
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,800
Are they Abu Sayyaf?

678
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,440
They've got weapons.
Safe to assume.

679
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,680
Playboy, you copy?

680
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,200
Can't talk right now.

681
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,800
Ah, for fuck's sake. Playboy, Playboy.

682
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,440
Canine coming your way.

683
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,640
You gotta be shitting me.

684
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,840
Git.

685
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,320
Fuck, Playboy.

686
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,800
Buffalo Bill has dismounted.
He is approaching your position.

687
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,520
Looks like he's coming towards Lassie.

688
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,040
Do not move.

689
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,760
Playboy,

690
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,360
Buffalo Bill is above your
position. Do not move.

691
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,760
Okay, Playboy. Looks
like Lassie's going home.

692
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Buffalo Bill has remounted.

693
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,600
Hostiles are leaving the party. Stand by.

694
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,120
Goddammit.

695
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,920
Playboy,

696
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,240
Buffalo Bill and his buddy
are gone. The truck is gone.

697
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,360
You are clear tracking
500 meters to your north.

698
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,160
There's a path up that
ridge on your one o'clock.

699
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,400
Hey, Playboy,

700
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,040
how you holding up?

701
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
I'm all right.

702
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,160
Where are you from, man?

703
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,880
Ohio.

704
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
No shit.

705
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,680
Me, too.

706
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,120
Brook Park.

707
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,560
Middleburg Heights.

708
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,480
We're basically fucking neighbors.

709
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,680
O-H.

710
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,680
I-O.

711
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,680
Fellow Buckeye.

712
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Get home much?

713
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,320
Yeah.

714
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,480
Yeah, I was just there.

715
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,080
Had to bury my father.

716
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,640
Oh, man. Sorry to hear.

717
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,080
Yeah, it's okay.

718
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,520
Were you guys close?

719
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,840
Yeah.

720
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,680
Yeah, he was a good guy.

721
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,120
In Sweet Sixteen news, the fucking Buckeyes

722
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,360
just shit the bed against VCU.

723
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,800
First round.

724
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,920
Trying to depress me more?

725
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,800
Sorry, man.

726
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,400
Hey, you ever got up to
Mama Santas on Mayfield?

727
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,280
Are you kidding me?

728
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,800
I lived at that place during high school.

729
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,360
Fucking great.

730
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,600
I know, right? I met
my first wife there in '95.

731
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,160
Oh, yeah?

732
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,680
Yeah. We met in line.

733
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,280
We both ordered stromboli.

734
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,400
Who the fuck orders stromboli?

735
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
I know, right?

736
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,480
I thought it was meant to be.

737
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,760
And it was.

738
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,640
Right up until it wasn't,

739
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,760
you know?

740
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,920
My current wife hates the shit.

741
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,680
She jealous?

742
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,840
Nah, man, worse...

743
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,720
she's vegan.

744
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,800
Ah, man. That is worse.

745
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
How do you know if someone's a vegan?

746
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,720
How?

747
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,520
They will tell you.

748
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,680
You're getting really close now,
man. Just keep up the pace. Good work.

749
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,920
ETA on the helo?

750
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
Playboy 0-6, this is Blackbird 2-5,

751
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,760
approaching LZ from east.

752
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,400
ETA three mikes, over.

753
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,400
Copy.

754
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,080
Reaper, how's my path to the LZ?

755
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,120
Clear.

756
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,760
Path is clear.

757
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,160
Time to get the hell
out of dodge, Playboy.

758
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,720
Thanks for the eyes, Reaper.

759
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,160
Happy to do it.

760
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,320
Hey, drop me a line
next time you're in Vegas.

761
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,160
I have a solid hookup for Disney on Ice.

762
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,600
You lost me.

763
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,200
I might pass on that,

764
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,680
but I'm at Nellis all the time.

765
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm here, man. Call CENTCOM.

766
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,840
Raven Squadron. Eddie Grim.

767
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,200
Just ask for Reaper.

768
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,320
Will do.

769
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,680
Blackbird 2-5, I have a
visual. LZ is clear for extract.

770
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,280
Marking position with I-R.

771
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,320
Roger that, Playboy. I
have your position marked.

772
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,360
Contact! I'm hit! I'm hit!

773
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,840
Playboy, are you injured?

774
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,440
Negative!

775
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,600
Must have hit my plate.

776
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,120
Reaper, hostiles, 100 meters
east. Two hundred meters south.

777
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,480
Contact! Blackbird. I have
multiple targets around the LZ.

778
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,640
Contact, Blackbird. Three
more hostiles on the west ridge

779
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,240
Small arms and an RPG.

780
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,560
Better move your ass.

781
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,520
RPG!

782
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,800
Shit!

783
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,400
Blackbird, can you stay in the
area until we can find a secure LZ?

784
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,480
Negative, Playboy.
LZ is too hot.

785
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,280
Back to you as fast as we can.

786
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,680
Shit!

787
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,920
Reaper, west ridge.

788
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,080
Contact, Playboy.

789
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,880
Three more trucks right through.

790
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,400
Reaper, need the bomb
300 meters to the west.

791
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,080
Cleared hot!

792
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,480
Roger that, Playboy.

793
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,560
Tally. Eyes on target.

794
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,040
Stay where you are, assholes.

795
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,000
Stay where you are, assholes.

796
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Weapon away. Impact 20 seconds.

797
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,920
Target is down. Now
get the fuck out of there.

798
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,040
Fuck! Taking fire.

799
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,920
This ain't done.

800
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,120
Got another truck
coming in from the west.

801
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,880
Jesus Christ, I'm pinned down.

802
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,640
How are they seeing me?

803
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,480
It's his strobe!

804
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,040
They must have night vision.
He's gotta turn his strobe off.

805
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,800
It's your strobe, Playboy.
Turn off your strobe.

806
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,320
Taking fire from the east.
Drop everything you have.

807
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,640
Playboy, I am Winchester.
I'm out of bombs.

808
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,360
ETA on the hornets is two mikes.

809
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,200
Playboy... this is Hornet 1.

810
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,120
Entering point out level.

811
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,280
I'm coming in on an east west heading.

812
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,720
Roger that, Hornet 1.

813
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,680
I'm 200 meters north of target
grid.

814
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,640
Keep all fire south of target grid.

815
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,400
I say again, all fire south.

816
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,680
Copy that. Be advised
this will be danger close.

817
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,160
Yes, yes. Cleared hot.

818
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,160
Copy.

819
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,240
Three, two, one!

820
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,480
Shit!

821
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,120
Still taking fire from west!

822
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,240
Copy, Playboy. Coming
around for another run.

823
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,080
Fuck!

824
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,480
Fuck this!

825
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,360
What do you want, Airman?

826
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,800
- Yeah, I'm doing a Starbucks run.
- Moving!

827
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,160
Colonel Packett is springing.

828
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,880
A what?

829
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,600
Starbucks.

830
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,120
Have you lost your mind?

831
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,120
Airman, leave!

832
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,280
Eyes on that hornet.

833
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
Give me some fire on the west ridge.

834
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,760
You're cleared hot.

835
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
Confirm. West or east?

836
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,080
West! West!

837
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,280
Copy that. This one is
going to be danger close.

838
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,880
We still do not have visual on you.

839
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,640
It's fine. Just drop
it! You're cleared hot!

840
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,520
Be advised, this is danger close.

841
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,240
Altitude.

842
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Altitude.

843
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,360
Pull up.

844
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,240
Pull up.

845
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,320
Playboy, I am Winchester.

846
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,120
Hornet 1 is RTB.

847
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,720
Copy that.

848
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,280
Good shooting.

849
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,040
How's it looking, Reaper?

850
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,720
Playboy, from what we
can see, it looks clear.

851
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,680
These fuckers know
we're out there now, so...

852
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,680
do not discount any surprises.

853
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,080
We got another LZ?

854
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,200
There's a clearing

855
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,880
two clicks northeast
of your position.

856
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,480
You're not gonna like it though.

857
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,280
You say northeast?

858
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,160
A-firm, Playboy.

859
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,160
Northeast is up a big fucking hill.

860
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,200
I know, man. I told you,
you weren't gonna like it.

861
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,320
I'm sorry, but that is the
closest LZ option we have.

862
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,920
Playboy, the helo is airborne.

863
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,280
ETA to the alternate
LZ is 90 mikes.

864
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,120
You copy?

865
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,840
Yeah, I'm here.

866
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,480
How you doing, man?

867
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
Pretty gassed.

868
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,760
Yeah, no doubt.

869
00:58:37
