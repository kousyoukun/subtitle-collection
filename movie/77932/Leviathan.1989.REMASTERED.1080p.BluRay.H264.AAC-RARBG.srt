任務:採集銀礦及其他研究

00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:07,771
任務等級:極度危險

6
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:29,661
四號礦坑,14號貨櫃準備吊起
<i>Four to shack. Container 14 ready to winch.</i>

六號礦坑,采銀工作完成
<i>Six to shack. Silver extraction completed.</i>

9
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:38,552
開採礦坑7號 居住與工作場所 90天已過87天

10
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:42,260
這些食物不錯,墨式卷餅,玉米餡餅...
<i>That's good eating. Burritos, enchiladas...</i>

11
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:46,181
- 黑豆和米飯,夥計.這是波多黎各人吃的 - 嘿, 我會帶你去波多黎各...
<i>Black beans and rice, man. That's Puerto Rican. Hey, I gotta take you...</i>

12
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,559
好吧,我不想打斷你們對偉大的拉丁美食的討論
Well, I hate to break up the great Latino gourmet debate...

13
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,562
但我們還沒下班呢，所以...
but we ain't off the clock yet, <i>so</i> uh...

14
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:56,983
自從我們在這有段日子了
Since we got a few more days here, can somebody...

15
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:59,986
有人能告訴我，誰是吊櫃員嗎?
please tell me who the hook is?

16
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:02,572
15號,是你嗎?
Fifteen, is that you?

17
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:05,701
是你吊的22號貨櫃嗎?
You got a hook on box 22?

18
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,662
有人在問你，是你吊的22號貨櫃嗎？你這蠢貨
The man is asking you if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit.

19
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:11,081
注意你的語氣,希克斯派克 15號呼叫礦坑
Watch your mouth, Sixpack. Fifteen to shack.

20
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:13,291
我是鐘斯，我不是吊櫃員
This is Jones. I ain't the hook.

21
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,293
7號呼叫礦坑，我是吊櫃員
Seven to shack. I'm the hook.

22
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:18,171
好的,吊起22號貨櫃然後下班
Okay there, seven. Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

23
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:21,299
威莉,你怎麼了?我們在等你
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something? We're all waitin' on ya honey.

24
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,300
別廢話，希克斯派克
Go suck on a shrimp, Sixpack.

25
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:34,187
七號呼叫礦坑,準備吊起
Seven to shack. Ready to winch.

26
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:39,188
好的,吊起
There we go. Winch on.

27
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,321
各位,下班回家吧
Okay, miners, let's come on home.

28
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,198
你聽到他說的了？我們走吧
You heard the man. Let's get movin' folks.

29
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,492
來吧,夥計們，我們還有三天就要離開這了
Come on, guys. We only have three days left.

30
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:52,493
我聽到了
I hear that.

31
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:03,129
貝克，燒好水，我們要回來了
Put the kettle on, Beck. We're coming home.

32
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,736
醫生出去了

33
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,321
好的，醫生， 事情不如你所見的
Well, Doc, not so as you'd notice

34
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,865
從早到日落
but the sun has set on yet another day

35
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:30,243
在家園辛勤勞動了一整天
of hard labor and toil here at the homestead.

36
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:34,164
挖到16噸，你又得到了什麼？
Sixteen tons and what do you get.

37
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,917
日漸老去，還深陷債務
Another day older and deeper in debt

38
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,545
聖彼得啊, 別召喚我，因為我還不能去
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go

39
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:45,546
我還欠公司一條命
I owe my soul to the company store.

40
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:56,186
鐘斯! 幫我下!
Jonesy! Help!

41
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:57,604
柯布!
Cobb!

42
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,232
我的呼吸器停止運行了，我正在失去壓力
My rebreather's stopped! I'm losing compression!

43
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,150
我的潛水服要爆裂了 醫生! 貝克!
I'm gonna blow my suit! Doc! Beck!

44
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,945
我聽到了,從這堿搢繭L不妥
Yeah, I got you, DeJesus. You look fine from in here.

45
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,322
- 把情況告訴我 - 我的呼吸器停了!
- Give me a readout. - My rebreather's stopped!

46
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:10,158
我正在失去壓力 無法呼吸
I'm losing compression! I can't breathe!

47
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,701
德休斯先生, 我不能...
Mr. DeJesus, I can't...

48
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,037
如果你這樣驚慌失措,我就無法獲知情況
I can't get an accurate readout if you panic.

49
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,415
醫生,是急事,出麻煩了,速來
Doc, we got an emergency here. We need you. Got trouble.

50
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,709
醫生! 醫生!
Doc! Doc!

51
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,088
慢慢用鼻吸氣...
So just breathe slowly and through your nose and uh...

52
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,340
用口呼氣
and out through your mouth.

53
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,425
我認為你只是呼吸過速
I think you're hyperventilating.

54
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:30,720
- 呼吸過速, 才不是呢! - 你怎麼做的??
- Hyperventilating, my ass! - How do you do this?

55
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,764
- 他會爆炸的 - 不,他不會爆炸
- He's gonna blow. - No, he's not gonna blow!

56
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:35,267
醫生! 貝克!
(coughing) Doc! Beck!

57
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:40,268
- 救命! - 醫生, 快來!
- Help! - Doc, come on!

58
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:42,941
- 查看他的氧氣存量 - 我在查
- Check his oxygen level. - Yeah, I'm doin' that.

59
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:47,942
- 想辦法, 快點! - 我在想
- Do something, quick! - I'm doin' it.

60
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,202
救命!
Help!

61
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:57,038
該死!
Damn!

62
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,082
把他接往RV四號接駁器.
Hook him to my RV-four transpac.

63
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,293
好的,把他接往...
Right. Hook him to the RV...

64
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:04,254
不,別這樣做! 不要包圍他
No! Don't do that! Don't circumventilate him.

65
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:07,048
我想他在冒內爆的危險
I think you're risking an implosion probability.

66
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,968
醫生,我們需要你 把他送來礦坑
Doc, we need you. Bring him into the shack.

67
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:13,054
- 時間不夠！ - 還有時間,照做吧
- There's not enough time! - You've got time. Just do it.

68
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,681
我會沒命的！
I'm gonna die!

69
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:19,682
你不會死的
You ain't gonna die.

70
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:28,691
繼續讓他移動
Just keep him moving.

71
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:34,071
小心點！我們可以安然無恙的
Take it easy. We'll make it. We'll make it.

72
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:40,578
打開這該死的門
Open the damn door.

73
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:46,125
快來,救他進去
Come on! Get him inside!

74
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:57,511
保持移動
Keep him moving.

75
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,608
把鎖拉起
Come on, lift lock. Go.

76
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:11,609
來吧，把鎖拉起來
Come on, lift lock. Up.

77
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:14,467
呼吸器，沒氣泡的東西不能信任
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

78
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:17,345
不是那該死的潛水衣，夥計 是貝克
It ain't the goddamn suit, man. It's Beck.

79
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:20,015
不是他的錯 醫生該在場的
It's not his fault. Doc should've been there.

80
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,225
若他真的有麻煩,醫生會在場
If he was a real shack boss, Doc would have been there.

81
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,935
這次是他走運
He got real lucky this time.

82
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:28,936
嗨！今天華爾街指數衝破了15000點
Hey, Wall Street broke the 15,000-point barrier today.

83
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,777
見鬼！我的獎金
Shit. There goes my bonus.

84
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,530
你知道嗎,我遇過海底爆炸的人
You know, I stood next to a guy who blew a suit once.

85
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,950
當時在印度洋,我來告訴你孩子，那情形很可怕
He was in the Indian Ocean. Boy, I'm telling you that is not a pretty sight.

86
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,285
嘿，別打擾他
Hey, leave Hazy alone, man.

87
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:43,997
潛水衣上就這麼一個小孔
One tiny little hole in the fucking toe of his suit man.

88
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,416
不會比你的小弟弟大
No bigger than your click.

89
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,793
沒錯，孩子！海水都湧了進去
Yeah, boy, that ocean came in.

90
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:52,964
壓力使他整個人的軀體都被擠進了頭盔
The pressure just crammed his whole body up into his helmet.

91
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:57,135
我們只能埋葬了他的頭盔
We just buried his helmet.

92
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:01,181
- 那個人可能會是你, 德休斯 - 我知道什麼是內爆
- That would've been you, DeJesus. - Hey, I know about implosion.

93
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:04,768
對，你的褲子大概會爆炸
Yeah, I bet you do. I bet you was imploding in your pants.

94
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,979
- 別再說了, 礦坑! - 住手吧，夥計們
- Knock it off, Sixpack! - Cut it out, you guys.

95
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,857
我們被困在這個坑堣w經好長段日子了
We've been stuck down in this hole for a hell of a long time

96
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:15,028
關係密切，不能因這麼小的事情就內訌
and we had a close call. We're not gonna let something like this break us apart.

97
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,783
醫生由我負責
The doc is my responsibility.

98
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:23,244
醫生由我負責？
The doc is my responsibility.

99
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:23,857
廢話
Bullshit.

100
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:35,711
(Groaning and creaking)

101
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:44,599
天哪，我只希望有運氣能完成這兩個月來在2英里深的海底下的工作
God, it would be just my luck to finish two months' worth of work two miles under

102
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,477
還剩三天這地方就要崩潰了
and have the whole place fall apart with just three days left.

103
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,187
- 有誰查了海面的天氣如何？ - 是的
- Anyone check weather up top? - Yeah.

104
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,898
只是雨,但接送時會晴朗
It's raining, but it's supposed to be clear for pickup.

105
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,942
只要沒浪便成,我討厭海浪
As long as there's no waves. I hate waves.

106
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:58,196
海浪是最糟糕的，你知道如果你回到水面會做什麼嗎？?
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd be doin' if you were up top right now?

107
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:00,281
- 喝酒玩女人 - 噢,礦坑!
- Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy. - Oh, Sixpack!

108
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:04,077
- 交通堵塞如何？ - 見怪不怪
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic? - Hey, wherever I can find it.

109
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,079
我來告訴你，你會做些什麼
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

110
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,915
看著電視上令人作嘔的新聞
Be watching news on TV that's so bad, it makes you nauseous.

111
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,210
實在太糟糕了，你想駕車去呼吸新鮮空氣
So bad that you get in your car to get some fresh air

112
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,462
沒過5分鐘，你意識到
and after five minutes, you realize

113
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,674
空氣太污濁,叫你無法呼吸
the air's so dirty, you can't breathe.

114
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:21,427
如果你運氣好，你能回到家
If you're lucky enough to get back to your house...

115
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:24,139
你看著與別人無兩樣的屋子
that looks the same as everybody else's...

116
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,350
你發現老婆和以前一樣肥胖
you find that your wife is as fat as she ever was.

117
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,644
孩子沒因吸毒而使身體瘦弱
And the only reason your kids aren't strung out on the drugs

118
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:32,730
是因他們吸食新的毒品
they were using is because they've found some new drugs

119
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,109
而這堿O個好地方
which screw 'em up even more, and that's just the good part.

120
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,822
你們竟不知在這埵釵h幸福
You people just don't appreciate how good you've got it down here.

121
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,117
- 別讓我打攪你們,柯布先生 - 沒關係,我剛講完
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb. - That's all right, sir. I was just finished.

122
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:47,579
- 你感覺怎樣？, 德休斯? - 我沒事
- How are you feeling there, DeJesus? - I'm okay.

123
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,081
- 見過醫生沒有？ - 沒有
- See the doc yet? - No.

124
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,584
晚餐後最好給醫生看看
Well, you better let the doc take a look at you after dinner.

125
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:55,128
- 先前他很忙 - 當我們需要他時卻沒空
- Since he was busy earlier. - When we needed him.

126
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,630
你為什麼不讓我來對付醫生
Why don't you let me handle the doc.

127
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:01,676
這已使我感到好過些了
Makes me feel better already.

128
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:05,096
我在看…礦坑多時沒人保養
I was looking at the shack maintenance hours outstanding.

129
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,515
我知是怎麼回事
I see where this is going.

130
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:10,602
我們都沒時間維修礦坑
Well, um, see, all of us owe some shack maintenance time.

131
00:12:10,603 --> 00:12:12,228
今晚是動手維修的好時刻
I thought tonight would be a good time to get it done.

132
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:15,148
沒門，貝克先生，今晚不行
No way, Mr. Beck. No bleepin' way.

133
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,357
我們剛輪班完畢
We just pulled a full shift.

134
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:18,443
你不能再回礦坑堣u作
You can't call shack duty on top of a full shift.

135
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:20,445
這有違工會規定,合同上寫清的
That's a union violation. It's in the contract.

136
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:23,156
說得對, 柯布 讓我們聽聽工人代表有什麼話說
Right on, Cobb. Let's hear it for the shop steward.

137
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:24,032
喔!
Woo!

138
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,035
你聽到嗎, 貝克? 公司要依規矩辦事
Hear that, Becky? The company's got to abide by the rules.

139
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:30,288
我知道合同上怎麼寫, 柯布先生, 問題是你可依合同辦事
I know about the contract, Mr. Cobb, and the deal is you can follow the letter

140
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,832
也可多花一工作日把任務完成
of the contract to the law and you can spend an extra workday gettin' it done

141
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,418
也可今晚把它做完,明天休息
or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day.

142
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,630
- 你讓我們休息放假？ - 是的
- What, are you giving us the day off? - Looks that way.

143
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:40,757
我們的指標怎麼樣了？
What about our quota?

144
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,676
我們離指標只差25噸
You're only 25 tons off quota.

145
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,221
我們在最後一天會超額完成
You're bound to go way over that by the last day.

146
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:49,933
只是放一天假,對我來說沒分別
Look, folks, it's just a day off. It don't make no difference to me.

147
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,518
只看你們的意思,我以為是好事
It's just up to you. I thought it might be good.

148
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,812
- 我想放一天假 - 我也想
- Hell, I could use a day off. - Me too.

149
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:59,813
- 管他呢 - 好，有三個人贊成了
- What the hell. - Okay, shop steward's three.

150
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,321
- 四個 - 四個？還有麼？
- Four. - Four. Anybody else?

151
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:07,158
- 六個 - 好極了, 這就是我們要的
- Six. - All right, here's what we got.

152
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,827
柯布先生, 氣閘那不斷有聲響
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle in the air duct Somewhere.

153
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,829
- 去查看下 - 好
- Take a look at that. - Okay.

154
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,874
威莉,你檢查下德休斯的潛水衣
Williams, run a diagnostic on DeJesus' suit.

155
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,044
- 還有誰的潛水衣有問題？ - 我的袋子有問題
- Anybody else got any suit problems? - Yeah, my pocket.

156
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:23,045
你能檢查下我的口袋嗎，甜心？
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

157
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:27,262
晚安,我叫湯普生,單身
Good evening. Name's Thompson. Party of one.

158
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:30,723
我訂了桌子八點十五分 別太靠近樂隊，拜託
My reservation was 8:15. Not too near the Orchestra, please.

159
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,767
你明天會上班嗎，醫生?
Are you gonna come to work tomorrow, Doc?

160
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,769
我明早要上高爾夫球課
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.

161
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,896
如果沒什麼意外
Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver

162
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,357
午餐後我回來
I could stop by after lunch.

163
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:43,820
今天我們差點出意外 德休斯的潛水衣
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus's suit.

164
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,863
你有什麼話對我說嗎？
You have something to say to me?

165
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:48,241
是的
Yeah. Section 1412

166
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:50,827
海洋操作手冊1412段寫明
of the Tri-Oceanic manual requires

167
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,706
在外面操作時控制室
a mining shack's medical officer to be present in the control room

168
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:57,041
需要有一醫護人員當值
during all exterior operations.

169
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:02,042
我只想向你說清楚這點
I just wanna make real damn sure that's clear.

170
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:10,551
好吧,我明天只打九個洞
I'll keep it to nine holes in the morning.

171
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,390
多謝你處理這情況
Thank you, sir, for taking care of that situation.

172
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:03,441
- 該死的,你聽聽 - 那只是老化了而已
- Listen to it, for Christ's sake. - It's just gettin' old, that's all.

173
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:08,029
不能每次有聲響便要拆這地方
You don't see Doc opening me up every time my joints start to creak.

174
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,282
只是空氣迴圈，讓它去吧，來吧
As long as it's recycling the air, let it be. Come on.

175
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:16,283
十賠一 是短路
Ten to one it's a short.

176
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:16,997
好吧
<i>Okay-</i>

177
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,671
輕而易舉
Piece of cake.

178
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,928
好極了
Great.

179
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:07,964
好一對寶貨
Oh, mama! What a pair.

180
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,842
你說什麼？
What'd you say?

181
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:12,969
我說一對活寶
I said, "What a pair."

182
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,849
我們的礦坑主管和他的醫生朋友
Our shack boss and his washed-up doctor buddy make quite a...

183
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,850
- 你以為我說什麼？ - 說你喜歡我的大胸
- What did you think I said? - That you liked my boobs.

184
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,314
(Machine rattling)

185
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:30,315
你留心看我老柯布的手段吧，行不？
You watch the old Cobb magic, all right?

186
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:35,362
褒曼的心意
Compliments of Bowman.

187
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,166
(Rattling quiets down)

188
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:43,667
耶
Yeah.

189
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,425
你怎麼做到的？
How in the hell did you do that?

190
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:55,761
別對任何人說,這是商業機密
You don't say anything to anybody. Job security.

191
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:58,473
好不好?走吧
All right? Let's go.

192
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:03,474
慢著,你是怎麼辦到的？
Now, wait a minute, man. How in the hell did you do that?

193
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:10,109
沒什麼
That's clean.

194
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,110
但好像有什麼不對勁 啊,天哪
But there's nothing wrong with it. Oh, my God!

195
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,911
過來,九鬼
Come here, Kuki.

196
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,287
這,九鬼
Here, Kuki.

197
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:26,288
希克斯派克, 你個臭狗屎!
Sixpack, you shit!

198
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,295
驚喜吧!
Surprise!

199
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:32,298
我們會從礦坑采到多少銀？
How much silver are we gonna start taking out of that mine again?

200
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,717
就好像, 我來告訴你，瑪蒂, 你找到了個如假包換的
Well, it's like I tell you, Martin, I think you've got an honest-to-God

201
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,135
大富礦
bonanza on your hands.

202
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,971
幾天塈A就能把我們拉回去，這礦多的是
You can haul us out in a couple of days. This mine will play itself.

203
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,557
等我通知大西洋業務的主管
When I told the Director of Atlantic Operations

204
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,020
要安排地質學家來這堮...
that <i>we</i> had to stick a geologist down there and turn that mine around...

205
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:49,899
我不知道你會證明我是個天才
I had no idea that you were going to prove me a genius.

206
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,944
- 好吧，有你的關心我就很高興了，瑪蒂 - 我太激動了
- Well, I'm glad you're happy, Martin. - I'm ecstatic.

207
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,112
我等不及離開這兒
'Cause I can't wait to get the fuck outta here.

208
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,614
什麼？
What?

209
00:17:56,615 --> 00:18:00,451
我等不及再次做探險潛水
I said, I really can't wait to get back to exploration diving.

210
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:02,453
我多渴望研究...
I miss the research, and...

211
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:06,040
還有,我查過那湯普生醫生了
By the way, I ran that check on Dr. Thompson.

212
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,960
他除有幾次不服從指令外
He has a few incidences of insubordination

213
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:12,838
他的資歷很不錯
but his credentials are very impressive.

214
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,175
他讀醫理學,發明了幾種疫苗…
Pharmacology. He pioneered several vaccines.

215
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:19,345
這堣S不是梅約醫學中心 他為什麼會來這堙A瑪蒂？
Well, this ain't the Mayo Clinic. How'd he get down here, Martin?

216
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,681
他發明的血清害死了幾個人
A serum he developed killed several people.

217
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:24,976
那是意外,就是比例不對
An accident, but it got blown all out of proportion.

218
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:26,435
你看, 貝克
Now, look, Beck.

219
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,938
現在事情進展很順利
Things are beginning to move very fast now.

220
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,983
若他有麻煩,獲你需要幫忙…
If you're having a problem with him or you need any help...

221
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,318
只管說好了
just say the word.

222
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,571
用不著
No.

223
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:39,031
事情我還可以應付
No, I don't think it's anything I can't handle.

224
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:42,910
好的
Good.

225
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:45,955
你的股票如何？ 還沒賺到一百萬？
How are your stocks doin'? Haven't you made your million yet?

226
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:48,165
還沒有
Not yet.

227
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:52,962
- 三大洋公司的股票如何，夥計？ - 這兒有錢嗎？
- How's Tri-Oceanic doing, Bow? - Got money in this tub?

228
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:56,549
我簽了股票期權
Yeah. I signed up for the stock option.

229
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,384
去年他們失去一艘油輪後
You know, last year when they lost a tanker,

230
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:01,178
股票跌破了底價,我損失慘重
the bottom fell out of their stock and I lost a bloody fortune.

231
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:06,179
你把錢看得太認真了
You take your money too seriously.

232
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:13,604
(Structure groaning and creaking)

233
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,030
你說的對,我到這堥茖瓣ㄛO玩樂的
You're damn right, I do. I'm not down here for fun.

234
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:26,495
說誰玩樂？
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

235
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,747
看看那雙雪白的腿
(Wolf whistle)

236
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,124
Whew, look at those white legs!

237
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,544
嘿,威莉,寶貝,今晚的事很抱歉
Hey, Willie, honey, I'm sorry about that little incident tonight.

238
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:38,545
我以為開個小玩笑可以輕鬆一點
You know, I just thought a little humor might loosen things up.

239
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,178
小心, 希克斯派克!
Hey, watch it, Sixpack!

240
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,596
請別見怪
No hard feelings?

241
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:48,597
不會
Nope. Sweet dreams.

242
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:55,562
我佳人有約
I got a date with an angel.

243
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:05,993
來吧,寶貝
Come on, baby.

244
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:10,994
坐在我的臉上
Sit on my face.

245
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:17,501
(Screaming)

246
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:21,926
該死的, 威莉,你這婊子
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

247
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:25,596
你個賤人, 你看看我的腳！ 你看看我的腳！
You bitch, look at my foot! Look at my goddamn foot!

248
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:28,140
- 我還以為你覺得這很有趣 - 有趣？
- I thought you'd find that funny. - You think it's funny?

249
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,643
你把這個吃了便不會覺得有趣的了
You're gonna think it's funny when you eat this goddamn thing!

250
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:33,562
- 這兒到底發生了什麼事？ - 看看我的腳
- What the hell's goin' on here? - Look at my foot!

251
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:36,357
這婊子把海怪放在我的床鋪上
This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!

252
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,818
- 你怎知道是她幹的？ - 就是她，該死!
- How do you know it was her? - Lt was her, goddammit!

253
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,862
- 你是說我撒謊嗎, 貝克? - 可能有這麼大
- Are you calling me a liar, Beck? - That may be the size of it, Bubba.

254
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:45,616
- 你和威莉明天不用出海執勤 - 見鬼！
- You and Williams just pulled sea duty tomorrow. - Oh, bullshit!

255
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:49,078
老天！你們別吵好嗎？
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

256
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,079
取消半天假,若再胡鬧,全天取消
You just got half a day. Any more hoopla, it's a full one.

257
00:20:56,461 --> 00:21:01,461
準備練習
Ready to drill.

258
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,301
看來是不錯的礦脈,炸了它
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

259
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:09,302
- 好,炸了它 - 好的
- Let's blow it. - Blow this.

260
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,475
起爆
Charge activated.

261
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:14,103
嗨，威莉，有使你想起什麼嗎？
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

262
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:19,104
哈哈哈
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

263
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:20,138
哇
Oh, yeah!

264
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:33,243
看來是個大礦床
<i>It looks like the mother load, guys.</i>

265
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:38,419
這埵A亮點
I need more light on that, seven.

266
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,298
希克斯派克,聽到了嗎？我們要再多一點照明
Sixpack, you hear that? We need more light.

267
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,801
希克斯派克? 希克斯派克?
Sixpack? Sixpack?

268
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:48,220
好了
All right, look.

269
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:49,722
線纜卡住了
The cable's stuck.

270
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:54,723
(Screaming)

271
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:02,067
希克斯派克. 希克斯派克, 出了什麼事?
Sixpack. Sixpack, what's happened?

272
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:04,904
我們沒他的信號了
We've lost him.

273
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:07,865
你們做什麼？開派對嗎？, 希克斯派克?
Well, what are you doing? Having a party out there, Sixpack?

274
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:12,866
貝克,我正在找他
Beck, I'm looking for him.

275
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:21,082
礦坑呼叫七號 外面發生什麼事？, 威莉?
Shack to seven. What's going on out there, Williams?

276
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,340
他不見了
He's gone.

277
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:29,341
威莉, 跟我通話,發生了什麼事？
Williams, speak to me. What's happening out there?

278
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:32,723
希克斯派克. 希克斯派克, 回答我
Sixpack. Sixpack, answer.

279
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,558
我的天
Oh, my God!

280
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,477
威莉
Williams!

281
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:40,523
快點,威莉，後備的波段是哪個？
Come on, Williams. What's the alternate?

282
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,525
試試35波段
Try 35.

283
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:47,526
威莉? 是她
Williams? There she is.

284
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:50,741
威莉,你聽到了嗎？發生什麼事了？
Williams, you hear me? What's going on out there?

285
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:55,742
天,他掉進南山脊去了
God, he's gone over the South Ridge.

286
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,084
我要下去找他
I'm going down after him.

287
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:02,795
自己當心,我們不知道那下面有些什麼
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know what the hell is off that ridge.

288
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:07,796
來吧, 德休斯, 加油
Come on, Jonesy, work it out.

289
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:10,553
- 希克斯派克失蹤了! - 他們沒綁好安全繩嗎？
- Sixpack's lost! - Weren't they tied?

290
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,555
- 不知道,他不見了 - 他們該是綁好的
- I don't know, he's lost! - They're supposed to be tied.

291
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:15,099
- 來吧，我們走 - 走吧
- Come on. Let's go. - Move it!

292
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,644
老天！
Oh, God!

293
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,150
有什麼發現？
What've we got?

294
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:34,573
- 管蠕蟲 - 她怎麼脫身？
- Tube worms. - How's she gonna get out of there?

295
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:42,126
褒曼, 那衣服的空氣容量可維持多久？
Bowman, what's the self-contained air capacity of that suit?

296
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:47,127
三十分鐘
Thirty minutes.

297
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,636
六號呼叫礦坑
(Heavy radio interference) This is six to shack.

298
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:55,055
六號呼叫礦坑
Six to shack.

299
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:56,557
是希克斯派克
Sixpack.

300
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,810
上帝啊, 為什麼他的閃燈不亮？
For God's sakes, why doesn't Sixpack have his blinkers on?

301
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:04,811
他可能就在附近,但她看不見他
The man could be two feet away and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

302
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,488
什麼?
What?

303
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:16,118
這是什麼東西？
What is this?

304
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:16,619
一艘船?
A ship?

305
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:53,697
這是俄文
That's Russian.

306
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,532
你們看到了嗎？
Are you picking this up?

307
00:24:55,533 --> 00:25:00,533
是的,我們看到了,七號！ 你能把那畫面再給我們看下嗎?
Yeah, we got it, Seven. Can you open up that picture a little for us?

308
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,207
利維坦
Leviathan.

309
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:06,502
- 什麼? - 利維坦
- What? - Leviathan.

310
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:10,506
- 褒曼, 去查查 - 好的
- Bowman, run a check. - Sir.

311
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:13,926
- 威莉, 你的空氣存量好有多少？ - 二十分鐘
- Williams, What's your air reading? - Twenty minutes.

312
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:16,679
五分鐘後我們就來救你
We're gonna give you five, then we're coming in.

313
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,680
鐘斯, 柯布, 穿潛水衣
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

314
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:33,149
我要進去了
I'm going inside.

315
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:36,535
希克斯派克
Sixpack.

316
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:41,246
國際船隻註冊記錄  船名：利維坦   搜索中

317
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:41,250
希克斯派克, 回答我!
Sixpack, answer me!
國際船隻註冊記錄  船名：利維坦   搜索中

318
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,246
希克斯派克, 回答我!
Sixpack, answer me!

319
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:57,424
波羅地海?
Baltic Sea?

320
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,312
你在那發現什麼, 褒曼?
What have you got there, Bowman?

321
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:11,066
利維坦號，波羅地海的俄國客船
The Leviathan. Currently with the Russian Fleet in the Baltic Sea.

322
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:14,319
現在它就像堆馬糞，爛鐵
Currently horseshit. Currently it's rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

323
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,449
肯定搞錯了,一定是輸入資料不對
Well, it's gotta be wrong. Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

324
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,617
這媦g著:波羅地海
It's right here. The Baltic Sea.

325
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:24,872
也許船沉了,他們沒留意它失蹤
Maybe a ship sinks and they don't notice it's missing.

326
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:29,873
威莉,你還有一分鐘來找到希克斯派克並及離開現場
Williams, you got one minute to find Sixpack and get your butt out of there.

327
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:38,757
如果威莉還有一分鐘，那希克斯派克還有多少時間？
If Willie's got a minute, how much time does Sixpack have?

328
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:17,629
醫務室
The infirmary.

329
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,739
哇!
Whoooo!

330
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,616
我發財了, 寶貝!
I'm rich, honey!

331
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:45,202
我發財了
I'm rich!

332
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:48,705
安全失誤? 我一個字都聽不到
Safety negligence? I never even heard a word.

333
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:50,249
如果我聽不到又怎能報告？
How can I be on report if I never even heard a word?

334
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,416
我說得對不, 柯布?
Ain't that right, Cobby?

335
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,211
別廢話！這次你自我開脫好了, 希克斯派克.
Don't Cobby me. You're on your own this time, Sixpack.

336
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:57,089
你折騰了大家一天的時間
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

337
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,008
是只手錶,還在走
A Timex. And it's still ticking.

338
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,387
俄國盧布,看來錢不多
A little Russian money. It don't look like much.

339
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:07,724
這埵釭F西給你
Here's something for you, Bow.

340
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:11,270
嘿, 希克斯派克,看看你的女朋友
Hey, Sixpack, look at your girlfriends.

341
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:11,771
哎!
Whew!

342
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,616
- 那是什麼？ - "吉蒂愛基夫"
- What's that? - "Kitty Does Kiev."

343
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:26,410
- 很黃，很配你 - 讓我看看
- Porn. Right up your alley. - Let me see that.

344
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,287
是俄文,我不知道是什麼意思
It's in Russian. I don't know what it says.

345
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:33,288
- 能讓我看下嗎? - 醫生,那不是盤黃色錄影帶
- May I see it, please? - Doc, it's not really "Kitty Does Kiev."

346
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:38,088
- 是船長日誌的錄影帶 - 別告訴我你懂俄語
- It's the captain's log on videotape. - Don't tell me you read Russian.

347
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,300
我會俄語，德語，義大利語，法語
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish,

348
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:43,927
還會點斯瓦希婸y和零星的印地語
French, a little Swahili and a smattering of Hindi.

349
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:46,805
- 是我修讀醫科時的部分課程 - 吹牛
- It's part of my premed background. - Bullshit.

350
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,057
那你會相信個俄國老奶奶嗎？
Would you believe a Russian grandmother?

351
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:51,810
那我相信
That I believe.

352
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,648
- 這是什麼？ - 是個人物品,醫生，你能念下這嗎?
- What's this? - Personal effects, Doc. Can you read that?

353
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,652
死了
Deceased.

354
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:05,032
這是怎麼回事?
What's all this?

355
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:05,645
死了
Deceased.

356
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:10,858
死了
Deceased.

357
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:19,087
他們都死了
Deceased. All of them.

358
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,798
- 柯布先生,把這兒的事辦好 - 好的
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up. - Right.

359
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,799
德休斯, 把最後一個箱子倒出來
DeJesus, dump this last box.

360
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:31,808
- 那太可惜了 -是什麼？ - 是伏特加
That's nice. What is this? Vodka.

361
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,811
還是名牌酒
Stresnavga. Hey, that's good stuff.

362
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:37,022
可以用來開完工慶祝派對
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

363
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,566
嗨,貝克,如果你舉報我,這瓶酒就歸我
Hey, Becky, if I'm on report, I guess this bottle's mine, huh?

364
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:41,818
好吧，你說得對,就是你的
Well, I guess you're right. It is yours.

365
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,989
但這是偷竊,你違反了兩項安全守則
But it's pilferage, so now you're down for two counts of safety negligence

366
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,825
擅自上船，還危及威莉的性命
for risking Williams's life, going on that boat and possessing

367
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,577
以及擁有違禁品
restricted material.

368
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:55,578
- 柯布先生, 但所有的均遭沒收了 - 是這樣
- Mr. Cobb, all this gets impounded. - It's done.

369
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:59,169
還有一件事
And one more thing.

370
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,090
如果你再叫我一次“貝基”, 希克斯派克
I think if I hear you call me "Becky" one more time, Sixpack,

371
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:08,091
我就宰了你...我來真的
I'm gonna pop your tops... all six of 'em.

372
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,692
(Speaking in Russian)

373
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:25,445
我的醫務室住滿了人
My infirmary's filled.

374
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:28,240
隨船醫生告訴我，就像傳染病
The doctors on board tell me it's like a tropical infection.

375
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,993
(Speaking in Russian)

376
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:35,414
這情況是前所未見的
But it's not like anything I've ever seen before.

377
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,625
此外還有一事是我不明白的
And there's something else I don't understand.

378
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:41,003
他們都完了
And then it goes off.

379
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:45,007
那麼你想對我說些什麼, 醫生? 此事太詭異了
OK. So what do you want me to say, Doc? It all sounds mysterious?

380
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,134
是
Yea.

381
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:49,845
他為什麼捨棄了他的日誌記錄?
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

382
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:52,431
為什麼會有2艘相同船名的船在不同的地方?
Why are there two ships with the same name in different places?

383
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:55,767
我怎麼知道,是你懂俄語,也許你搞錯了？
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian. Maybe you read it wrong.

384
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:59,438
我沒有,即使我誤會了意思
I didn't. Even if I had, there should be a record of some ship that's

385
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:04,439
也許有記錄說這埵囧膜漲陴謒I了,但卻沒有記錄
sunk within 100 miles of here, and there's not.

386
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:15,867
你來看看,船殼有洞
And look at this tear. This hole in the hull.

387
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:20,913
這是爆炸的後果，我認為這是遭魚雷擊中
That's the result of an explosion. I think that was a torpedo hit.

388
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:24,129
我認為這艘船是被蓄意弄沉的
I think that ship was sunk on purpose.

389
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,966
嘿，醫生,你怎麼知道那是遭魚雷擊中？
Hey Doc, now how the hell do you know that's a torpedo hit?

390
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,344
我意思是,和另一艘船相撞也會有洞
I mean, a collision with another boat could produce that hole.

391
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:32,137
我不同意你的觀點
I don't agree with you.

392
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:34,181
- 相撞產生的洞不會這麼參差不齊... - 那是怎麼回事?
- This hole would not be so jagged... - So what?

393
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:36,683
我是說，那麼他們為什麼要弄沉自己的船?
I mean, so what if they scuttle their own boat?

394
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:39,436
我可不會離開自己的船
I can't get bent outta shape just because some people

395
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:43,273
就這樣把船員留在海底任其死去腐爛
got some jungle rot and ended up dead on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

396
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:48,274
我瞭解石塊，我瞭解礦石, 醫生 但我不瞭解俄國人的船
I know about rocks. I know about stones, Doc. I don't know about Russian boats.

397
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:51,823
好吧，我和你賭5塊錢，這是筆誤
Plus which, I bet you five dollars it's a clerical error.

398
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:55,619
見鬼去吧,我們有什麼疑問，就讓海事部門的人去搞清楚吧
Hell, we sounded the horn on it. Let the maritime people figure it out.

399
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,497
我得去把升降機修好
I gotta fix the lift lock.

400
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:01,500
還剩兩天
Okay, two more days.

401
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,752
別節外生枝了
Let's have no waves.

402
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:07,589
天氣系統上線，追測氣候變化
Weather system on line. Tracking meteorological patterns.

403
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,051
- 開始掃描 - 我討厭...
- Beginning scan. - I hate...

404
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:13,428
海浪
waves.

405
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,222
嗨， 柯布
Hey, Cobb.

406
00:32:15,223 --> 00:32:18,558
你知道瑞士人說四種語言嗎?
You know that in Switzerland, they speak four major languages?

407
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,603
- 我才不關心 - 我關心
- Ask me if I care. - I do.

408
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:24,272
離開這堳嵺瓻K去瑞士
When I get outta here, I'm goin' there.

409
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:26,942
我要找間漂亮的，白雪覆蓋的小屋……
I'm gonna find a nice snow-covered chalet...

410
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:31,943
熱情的女子，熊熊爐火，還有滑雪
warm little woman, crackling fire, and ski.

411
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:37,160
嘿, 柯布,如果你像這樣
Hey, Cobb, if you're gonna be doing that, man,

412
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:39,162
你要穿上沙灘褲去海灘
you should be wearing what you wear to the beach.

413
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:40,664
我討厭海灘
I hate the beach.

414
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:43,667
你看我找到什麼
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

415
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:47,712
- 真想不到,你查到了 - 對，來親一下
- I don't believe it. You got 'em. - Yeah, put it there.

416
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:50,090
怎麼回事，怎會是貝克的資料
What are you doing with Beck's personnel records?

417
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:51,675
注意看，你就明白了
Watch. You'll see.

418
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:55,720

Four, zero, five, four

419
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,305

eight, six.

420
00:32:57,306 --> 00:33:00,684
你們這些人真是胡說八道,你以為他真的笨？
You guys are so full of shit. I mean, how stupid do you think he is?

421
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:05,685
有誰會用社會福利號？
Who's gonna use their social security number?

422
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,525
行了
Bingo!

423
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:09,985
就是我的了
That bottle's mine.

424
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:13,530
- 聰明, 德休斯，樣本杯? - 別緊張
- Cute, DeJesus. Specimen cups? - Hey, loosen up, Bow.

425
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:16,867
- 嘿，威莉，倒了一杯給你 - 我不要了,謝謝
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you. - Not for me, thanks.

426
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,119
你要運動下，來吧，你該享受下了
All you do is exercise. Come on, you gotta live a little.

427
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,079
兩天塈畯n接受宇航員訓練
My astronaut training starts in two days.

428
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,373
算了吧，我替她喝
Forget space cadet. I'll drink hers.

429
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:26,877
若他回來發覺酒不見了怎辦？
What happens if he goes back and finds the bottle missing?

430
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:29,713
他不會的，我把伏特加放在這兒
He won't. I put the vodka in here.

431
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,007
機靈鬼
Smart lad.

432
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:32,508
乾杯
Cheers.

433
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:39,014
- 是水 - 貝克給換掉了
- It's water. - Beck switched it.

434
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:41,016
那鬼傢伙信不過我們
That son of a gun doesn't trust us.

435
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,643
那個滑頭，我要好好修理他
That pretty-boy little turd. I'm gonna fix his ass.

436
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:46,021
- 我們的派對泡了湯 - 不壞
- There goes our party. - It's not bad.

437
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:51,022
- 真的不錯 - 是水
- It's not bad at all. - It's water.

438
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:08,502
嗨
Hi!

439
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:13,503
我說過喜歡喝伏特加嗎？
Did I tell you vodka's my favorite drink?

440
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,000
(Groaning and creaking)

441
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:52,420
Whoa.
Whoa.

442
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:54,506
這是個龐然大物
That was a pretty big one, huh?

443
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,883
- 我們現在該適應吧 - 對
- You'd think we'd get used to it by now. - Yeah.

444
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:01,884
你在浪費時間,要完全關閉並詳細檢查
You're wasting your time here. This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

445
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:08,641
是, 我需要詳細檢查 訓練進行如何？
Yeah, I need an overhaul. How's the training goin'?

446
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:12,732
很順利
It's going well.

447
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:15,277
相信我做得不錯
I think I've got a good shot.

448
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,029
我只希望別人別為難我
I just wish everyone would stop giving me a hard time.

449
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,700
是啊，我明白你的意思
Yeah, I know what you mean.

450
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:26,701
你來幫我按鈕吧
Why don't you give me a hand and hit that button, huh?

451
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,457
- 按D，L鍵 - 什麼?
- Push D.L. - What?

452
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:29,958
D和L
D.L.

453
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:38,177
哦，夥計
Oh, man.

454
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:45,390
你來這兒幹嗎？
What are you doing down here?

455
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,268
我來這想修下升降機的鎖
Well, I'm trying to fix this short in the lift lock.

456
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,562
你來這兒幹什麼？威莉?
What are you doing down here, Williams?

457
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,897
- 你明白我的意思 - 是的,我明白
- You know what I mean. - Yeah, I know what you mean.

458
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:56,234
- 你不該來這礦坑的 - 你說得對
- You don't belong in a mine. - You got that right.

459
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:58,278
有人出了個好主意
But somebody just got the brilliant idea

460
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:01,072
把地質學家派來這兒管理你們這群鄉巴佬
to stick a geologist down here in charge of you cowboys.

461
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:03,366
也許他們認為我勝任
I think maybe they thought that just 'cause I could tell

462
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,368
該死的銀礦，我只知道怎樣運行這個地方
shit from silver, I'd know how to run this place.

463
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,788
你是麼？
Well, do you?

464
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:11,708
你說呢？
You tell me.

465
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:13,752
我認為你處理德休斯的方法很好
I think you handled DeJesus pretty well.

466
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,421
是嘛?
Yeah?

467
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:20,675
只是走運而已,我都嚇得要死
Well, that was luck. I was scared to death.

468
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:24,054
希克斯派克怎麼樣了?
What about Sixpack?

469
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:27,057
他怎麼了？
What about him?

470
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:31,144
你會因為我而罰他嗎？
Did you bust him because of me?

471
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:34,356
可能吧
Maybe.

472
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:39,357
很感激你,但我沒事
Well, I appreciate that. But I'm okay.

473
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:45,655
我知道
Yeah, I know.

474
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:46,451
好
Good.

475
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:57,708
話說回來,你怎知他們打伏特加的注意？
Oh, by the way, how did you know they'd get into the vodka?

476
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:04,010
換了是我也會這麼做
Hell, that's what I would've done.

477
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:09,011
也許我們是英雄所做略同
Maybe you're more one of us than you think.

478
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,991
早安
Good morning.

479
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,618
對不起
Sorry.

480
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,619
好的
Okay. That's good.

481
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,459
只管看著我的前額
Just look at my forehead.

482
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,460
對了
That's it.

483
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:48,467
給我看看舌頭
Let me see your tongue.

484
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,766
早安,各位 有什麼不妥嗎, 醫生?
Good morning, gentlemen. What's wrong, Doc?

485
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:56,646
看來就是點宿醉
I'm getting a pretty good imitation of a hangover.

486
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:58,940
- 脫下襯衣 - 那不是宿醉
- Take off your shirt. - Lt ain't no hangover.

487
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:03,941
感覺要嚴重千倍
Feels about 1000 times worse.

488
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:08,825
這些瘀痕有了多久？
How long did you have these spots?

489
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:13,826
- 什麼 - 別碰它們
- What? - Don't touch it.

490
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:22,964
好吧，作為礦坑的主管,由你決定
Well, as First Officer of the shack, it's your call.

491
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:26,342
換了我,便不會倉促行事
But if I were you, I'd not be too hasty.

492
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,886
我不明白
I don't get it.

493
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:32,849
在既定離開時間提前一天撤退
Any evacuation 24 hours before a scheduled pickup

494
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,436
或多或少對良好的記錄有影響
won't look good on an otherwise excellent record.

495
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:41,437
但一如我說,由你決定
But like I said, it's your call.

496
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:49,073
沒有他掉下去
Well, <i>as</i> bad as he is, there's no way

497
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:52,160
我們是無法完成指標的
we're gonna make that quota without his sad self down there.

498
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:55,371
- 他幫了我們 - 不，我不這麼想
- He's tankin' on us. - No, I don't think so.

499
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:58,458
昨晚他語氣不太好
I heard him last night, and he didn't sound so good.

500
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,711
公司看到數字時會考慮到這點
The company will take that under consideration when they look at our numbers.

501
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:05,548
親愛的，公司才不管個中原因
Sweetheart, the company doesn't give a damn about why.

502
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,592
合同上說如果我們無法完成指標
The contract says, if we miss our quota

503
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:10,220
他們只會付給我們一半酬金
they only gotta pay us half pay for the entire month.

504
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,222
我相信他們肯定會這樣做
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

505
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:14,933
那傢伙真的是幫了我們
The bastard's definitely tanking on us.

506
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,644
- 我認為你說得對 - 但願他是,可是他又不是
- Yep, I think you're right. - I wish you were, but he's not.

507
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,646
他真討厭,他今天沒來
He's really sick. He ain't comin' out today.

508
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,689
- 威莉,從那下來 - 這下子可好了
- Williams, take her down. - That's terrific.

509
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,360
- 三個月的工作化為烏有 - 大家走吧
- Three months of work down the tubes. - You're outta here, guys.

510
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,738
你在盤點存貨嗎？
So, what, are you taking inventory?

511
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:33,739
不是,我準備好打乒乓球
No, Mr. Jones. I'm getting ready to play Ping-Pong.

512
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:37,288
我要去工作了,你有什麼困難嗎？
I'm goin' to work, Mr. Jones. You got a problem with that?

513
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:42,289
- 工作? - 工作
- Work? - Work.

514
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:55,056
- 你儘量保持穩定 - 這是怎麼回事, 醫生?
- Try to hold as steady as you can. - What the hell is it, Doc?

515
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,642
-我要取些皮膚樣本 -給我吃藥
- I'm taking a little skin sample. - Come on. Give me something.

516
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,727
等一會,保持穩定
Just a second. Steady as you can.

517
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:03,231
我設法快點完事,行了
Try to do it as quick as I can. That's it. I got it.

518
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:08,232
穩住，穩住，小心
Steady, steady, steady. Easy, easy.

519
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:12,448
沒事的，別用手碰它
It's all right. Keep your hands off it.

520
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,661
按住這
Here. Hold that.

521
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:21,662
我要在顯微鏡下看清楚
I'm gonna take a look at this under the microscope.

522
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,659
22號貨櫃滿了
Container 22 is full, sir.

523
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,287
好,這個滿了便運走,換新的箱子來
Okay, this one's full up, so let's run her outta here and bring in a new one.

524
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:04,288
好的
You got it.

525
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,557
未知生物體? 別逗了
"An organism of unknown origin." No kidding.

526
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:23,650
告訴我些我不知道的
Tell me something I don't know.

527
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,558
給我個機會、這不是一年級的生物學、樣本完成並記錄
告訴我些我不知道的
Tell me something I don't know.

528
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:26,111
給我個機會、這不是一年級的生物學、樣本完成並記錄

529
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,114
我要個答案

530
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,867
該死的，來猜一猜
Goddamn it, take a guess.

531
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:32,784
沒頭緒
該死的，來猜一猜
Goddamn it, take a guess.

532
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:34,568
該死的，來猜一猜
Goddamn it, take a guess.

533
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,122
處理中

534
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:45,756
基因變異?

535
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:39,637
去外面好好工作, 貝基 我是說,貝克先生
Good work out there, Becky. I mean, Mr. Beck.

536
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:42,640
幹得不壞, 貝克先生
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

537
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:45,601
小意思
No harm done.

538
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:48,438
只要別稱我駭客
Just don't call me cracker.

539
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:50,690
打起精神來
Perk up, sport.

540
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:55,691
他怎會在八小時內死於皮膚發癢?
How can the guy die from a skin rash in eight hours?

541
00:42:56,697 --> 00:42:59,991
戴上它 我想你檢驗他
Put this on. I want you to examine him.

542
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:04,992
- 我不是醫生 - 幹著，不需要你是醫生
- I'm not a doctor. - For this, you don't need to be.

543
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:35,068
好吧，大人
Oh, Lord.

544
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,487
我戴這個是因為你認為會傳染?
Am I wearing this 'cause you think it might be contagious?

545
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:39,489
我不知道，我也不知道是不是
I don't know if it is, I don't know if it isn't.

546
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,325
我什麼也不知道,也沒人知道
I don't know a damn thing. Neither does anyone else.

547
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:45,244
這些天我都在與海軍堛漫唹抾貑琱H交流
I've been going back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day.

548
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:47,205
向海洋醫療中心的專家諮詢...
Consulting with the best people in marine medicine...

549
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:49,207
他們都是病毒學上最好的專家
the best people in virology.

550
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,667
他們甚至不相信我描述的病徵
They don't even believe the symptoms I'm describing.

551
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:54,337
他們猜測，這只是一個猜測...
Their best guess, and that's all it is is just a guess...

552
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,798
在希克斯派克死前，
is that before Sixpack died, he was undergoing

553
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,800
發生了某些遺傳變異
some form of genetic alteration.

554
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:01,052
什麼引起遺傳變異？
Genetic alteration from what?

555
00:44:01,053 --> 00:44:03,054
可能是許許多多事情
It could be a million things.

556
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:06,015
某些食物,空氣
Something in the food, the air.

557
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:11,016
希克斯派克上過那艘船,威莉也是
Sixpack went in that ship, and so did Williams.

558
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:13,231
我想檢驗其餘的船員
I want to examine the rest of the crew.

559
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:16,234
但我不想引起他們恐慌
But I don't want to create a panic, so until I get some answers

560
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:21,235
在找出答案前,別告訴大家希克斯派克的死訊
I don't think we should tell them that Sixpack is dead.

561
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:26,202
他皮膚怎麼回事？是皰疹還是麻疹？ 到底是什麼？
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles? What is it?

562
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:29,038
很難確切描述
It's a little difficult to describe.

563
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,498
天哪，這將是很糟糕的事情
Christ, it would be a hell of a thing

564
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,875
如果我染上了麻疹
if I went back up to the roof with a herpes thing.

565
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:37,130
我妻子怎麼說了都不會明白
My wife would never understand that at all.

566
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:39,173
我們用不著擔心這個,是嗎？
I don't think we have to worry about that, do we?

567
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:41,175
不,她不會明白
She wouldn't understand that at all.

568
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:43,594
她以為我出去鬼混的
She'd think I was down here screwing my head off or something.

569
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:46,222
穿上襯衣吧
Put on your shirt.

570
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:51,223
- 沒事吧 - 對，你很好
- It's all right? - Yeah, you're fine.

571
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:54,689
這些事是不必要的, 醫生
This whole thing is unnecessary, Doc.

572
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,690
我唯一知道的皮膚問題,就是種族白人
The only skin problem I can see is white people.

573
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:03,072
你為什麼戴著手套？
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

574
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:05,449
這不是彎腰的時候，是不?
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

575
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,911
- 出什麼岔子了嗎? - 沒有,我只想查看一些東西
- Anything wrong? - No, I just wanted to see something.

576
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:11,205
僅此而已
That's all.

577
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:15,126
你認為是和船上的事有關？
You think it has anything to do with going on that ship?

578
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:17,295
有可能,但若是這樣
Well, it's a possibility. But if that was the case

579
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:19,589
你便會有病徵,是嗎？
you'd be showing some symptoms, wouldn't you?

580
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,800
- 我沒事？ - 你很好
- I'm okay? - You're fine.

581
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,802
你真的沒事
No, really, you're fine.

582
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:27,763
好極了，謝謝 醫生
Great. Thanks, Doc.

583
00:45:27,764 --> 00:45:30,516
你什麼意思,皮膚問題?
What do you mean, a skin problem?

584
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:32,685
皮膚起變化？
Your skin changes?

585
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:37,686
- 是的，變黑及起鱗片 - 什麼,像魚那樣?
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly. - What, like a fish?

586
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,320
- 是的, 就像魚一樣 - 我只是開個玩笑, 醫生
- Yeah, like a fish. - I was justjoking, Doc.

587
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:53,911
你可以到外面去把衣服穿好
You can finish getting dressed now.

588
00:45:54,374 --> 00:45:59,374
噢,褒曼，對不起,我去去就回
Oh, Bowman. I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

589
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:08,346
- 形態變異? - 變異？
- Generic alteration? - Genetic.

590
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:11,849
隨便了，你認為只局限於這船的船員?
Whatever. But you think it's restricted to this one crew member?

591
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,851
- 目前是的,不過 - 不過什麼?
- Well, so far, but... - But what?

592
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,853
到頭來如果又沒事怎麼辦？
What if it turns out to be nothing?

593
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:18,064
你說什麼啊？已經有一個人死了
What are you talking about? It's already killed one man!

594
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:22,818
但你沒證據說這是傳染病，對不?
But you have no proof that this disease is contagious, do you?

595
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:27,819
我們以前也曾判斷失誤過，對不，湯普生醫生?
And we've been wrong before, haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

596
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:30,826
瞧，瑪蒂,我認為你看錯了問題
Look, Martin, I think you're missing the point here.

597
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:33,329
我的船員有危險,這病徵我見過
My crew's in jeopardy. I've seen this disease.

598
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,331
而且我們也不是在海灘邊
And it's no day at the beach.

599
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:38,125
所以根據手冊上第539條
So by way of paragraph 539 of the manual

600
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:41,170
我命令你啟動醫療緊急程式，
I'm ordering you to start an emergency medical evacuation

601
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:43,214
並疏散礦坑堛漫狾酗H員
of all the personnel on the shack.

602
00:46:43,215 --> 00:46:45,341
這由你決定,不過可惜的是
It's your call, but Unfortunately

603
00:46:45,342 --> 00:46:48,052
我們沒法這麼快來接你們
we can't pick you up so soon.

604
00:46:48,053 --> 00:46:51,430
離古巴海岸六百里處有颶風
There's a hurricane 600 miles off the coast of Cuba

605
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:53,432
可能吹向你們
possibly coming your way.

606
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:56,894
如果這樣,公司可不想讓員工的生命冒危險
And if it does, the company does not want to risk losing you folks.

607
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:57,895
你說什麼?
What are you saying?

608
00:46:57,896 --> 00:46:59,981
你是說你不能按原定時間來接我們？
Are you saying you're not gonna pick us up at the scheduled time?

609
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:02,024
不會耽誤太久的
It shouldn't be a long delay.

610
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:04,527
好吧, 太久是多長時間? 一天？一周？
Well, What's a long delay? A day? A week? What?

611
00:47:04,528 --> 00:47:08,072
十二小時,我們明早就可以確定
Twelve hours. We should know something first thing in the morning.

612
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:11,617
- 我會繼續與你聯絡的 - 你最好在那
- I'll keep you posted. - You better be there.

613
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,577
- 十二小時？ - 十二小時
- Twelve hours. - Twelve hours.

614
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:18,578
我保證
I promise.

615
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:32,555
褒曼，褒曼,你沒事吧?
Bow. Bow, are you okay?

616
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:36,642
我的天
Oh, my God. Come on.

617
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:41,643
你能來幫幫我們嗎？
Can you help us here?

618
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:47,858
- 讓我們把她放在這 - 來吧，小心點
- Let's put her here. - Come on. Take it easy.

619
00:47:48,947 --> 00:47:53,534
沒事的
It's all right.

620
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:57,204
你不會有事的,好嗎? 我會去找醫生,好嗎?
You're gonna be all right, okay? I'm gonna go find Doc, all right?

621
00:47:57,205 --> 00:48:02,205
嗨, 醫生?也許他和希克斯派克在一起
Hey, Doc? Maybe he's with Sixpack.

622
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,505
醫生? 嗨，你在這?
Doc? Hey, you in here?

623
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,550
希克斯派克?
Sixpack?

624
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:11,969
嗨,夥計,你在幹嘛?
Hey, man, how you doin'?

625
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,849
我們達成指標了, 夥計, 雖然不用謝你和你的狗，但我們辦到了
We made quota today, man, no thanks to you, you dog, but we made it.

626
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,769
你可能不信，但貝克幫了我們
You won't believe this, man, but Beck helped us out.

627
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,813
對,我們只是把褒曼送來這
Yeah, we just brought Bowman in, man.

628
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:24,815
她不太舒服
She don't look too good.

629
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:29,195
你明白,我希望你們患的不是傳染病
You know, I hope what you got ain't catchin'.

630
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,572
瞧, 我很抱歉
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

631
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:34,617
你回去再睡吧,好嗎?
You go on back to sleep, okay?

632
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:39,618
我一會再跟你談
I'll talk to you later, all right?

633
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:48,464
- 我要去查看下控制室 - 好的
- I'm gonna go check the control room. - Okay.

634
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:51,592
- 我很快就回來，行嗎? - 威莉, 拜託別走!
- I'll be back in a minute, okay? - Willie, please don't go!

635
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:55,137
請別離開我，我太難受了
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

636
00:48:55,138 --> 00:49:00,138
噓，你會沒事的，別擔心
Shh. You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

637
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,004
(Crying)

638
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:48,315
希克斯派克...
Sixpack...

639
00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:48,860
希克斯派克?
Sixpack?

640
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:57,946
我的頭髮在掉
My hair's coming out.

641
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:16,635
你說什麼? 在醫務室?
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

642
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:18,637
對
Yeah.

643
00:50:18,638 --> 00:50:19,138
褒曼?
Bowman?

644
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:28,393
我不明白了，我們剛把她留在那
I don't understand. We just left her here.

645
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:41,990
褒曼? 褒曼, 醫生來了!
Bowman? Bowman, it's Doc!

646
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:54,551
噢，天哪
Oh, man.

647
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:36,461
除此之外,我再沒什麼可告訴你...
Other than that, there's not much more that I can tell you about it...

648
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:40,761
你們當中沒有人有病徵
except that none of you have any of the symptoms.

649
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:44,139
是這疾病殺了褒曼？
And this disease, it killed Bow?

650
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,433
不
No.

651
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:51,188
不是，她是自殺的
No, she killed herself.

652
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:53,649
嘿，我們最好離開這兒
Hey, we're getting outta here just in time.

653
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,943
是的，不過我們還有一個麻煩
Yeah, well, that's a whole 'nother problem.

654
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:59,780
我們得等人來接，但可能有颶風在向這兒吹來.
We're on hold for the pickup. There's a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

655
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:03,075
- 颶風? - 是的,我們要延期十二小時
- A hurricane? - Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

656
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:08,076
十二小時？那我們怎麼辦？不能在這幹等12小時
Twelve hours? What're we gonna do? We can't stay here for 12...

657
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,710
- 那是什麼聲音? - 慢著,別亂動
- What was that? - Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

658
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:17,711
好嗎? 醫生
Okay? Doc.

659
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:36,400
噢，天哪
Oh, my God.

660
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,402
那是什麼東西？
What is this?

661
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:43,403
到底怎麼回事, 醫生?
What's goin' on, Doc?

662
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:14,017
- 好,威莉, 去開門 - 收到
- Okay, Willie, get the door. - Got it.

663
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,523
貝克
Beck.

664
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:19,943
合同上說過未經許可不得擅自棄置屍體
The contract states that you can't dispose of a body without authorization.

665
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:22,780
算了吧，你能不能別再拿合同來說事了？
Come on. Will you for once forget about the contract?

666
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:27,781
C區門要健康安全密碼 小心
Section C of the Health and Safety Code. Watch it.

667
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:31,246
威莉,開啟門鎖程式
Willie, program that lift lock.

668
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:34,249
我覺到有什麼東西在
Hey, I feel something.

669
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,251
你在說什麼？他們已經死了
What are you talkin' about? They're dead.

670
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:39,046
等會,我也覺到有什麼東西
Wait a minute. I feel something too.

671
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,173
- 我們走 - 有什麼活的東西在這
- Let's go. - Somebody's alive in here.

672
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:42,341
來吧，來吧
Come on. Come on. Come on.

673
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:43,550
好的,來吧,讓我們把它沖走，醫生
Alright, come on, let's flush it, Doc.

674
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,719
你說什麼"沖走它?" 我們說的可是些人
What do you mean "Flush it?" They're human beings we're talking about

675
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,221
- 看在上帝的面上，拜託! - 如果有人還活著怎麼辦?
- for God's sake! - What if one's alive?

676
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:49,014
- 那麼我們來默哀下? - 就這樣,來吧，醫生
- How about a moment of silence? - Let's do it, Doc.

677
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:50,808
上帝啊,他們還活著!
My God, they're alive!

678
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:55,809
- 抬起來 - 打開看看
- Get it up here. - Let's have a look.

679
00:53:56,189 --> 00:53:57,439
褒曼
Bow.

680
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,358
- 別停! - 那該死的是什麼東西?
- Don't stop! - What the hell was that?

681
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,486
按那鈕!
Hit the button!

682
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:04,655
- 按那左邊的鈕! - 快從這出去!
- Hit the lift button! - Get outta there!

683
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:08,033
沖走那該死的東西!沖走它!
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

684
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:09,868
貝克!
Beck!

685
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:10,413
這!
Come on!

686
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:46,468
噢，天哪!
Oh, God!

687
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:57,017
它朝這過來了，監視器鏡頭會沿途拍到在哪個房間，就是這樣
It's coming up now. That camera's gonna move into this room. That's it.

688
00:55:57,018 --> 00:56:02,018
這像是病房或實驗室什麼的，停，往回倒
Some kind of sick bay or lab or something. Hold it. Run it back.

689
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:06,944
就這，停，現在放
That's it. Stop. Now move in.

690
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:10,531
看見沒?像是個人類頭骨，我不清楚
See? It looks like a human skull, but I don't know.

691
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:15,532
- 有點不對勁，它... - 比較大
- There's something about it. It's... - Bigger.

692
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:26,755
也許是有人在作怪，你看看那只手
Well, somebody's been screwing around. Just take a look at that hand.

693
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:31,718
- 你看那只手有多大 - 如果你說的是變異...
- Look at the size of it. - If you were tampering with genetics...

694
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,471
為何到了基本模式便停滯不前?
why stop with the base model?

695
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:37,766
為何不設法改變人類形態?
Why not try to alter the human form?

696
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:42,312
海底人,一個可以在水底生存的人
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live underwater. Think of the possibilities.

697
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:44,314
就像再生脫胎換骨
Regeneration.

698
00:56:44,315 --> 00:56:47,901
可以抵抗嚴寒,壓力
The ability to withstand extreme cold, pressure.

699
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:50,988
你想想看，海底採礦,海底耕作
Just think of it. Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

700
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:53,991
下一步會怎樣?我的意思是,如果有一天我們再不需要飛機
<i>So</i> What's next? I mean, what if we run outta airplanes one day?

701
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:57,786
我們會怎樣?進化成像鳥一樣?
What are we gonna do? Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

702
00:56:57,787 --> 00:57:02,787
大自然規律不可違背
<i>Natura no confundendo est.</i>

703
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:07,876
我是說"不能對自然規律亂來"
Loosely translated: "Don't fuck with Mother Nature."

704
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:28,859
我最好該通知公司
I better let the company know.

705
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,571
你認為他們早已懷疑到了嗎？
Have you ever thought that they may suspect already?

706
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:34,656
是的，我想到過, 醫生
Yeah. I thought about that, Doc.

707
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,701
但我一直認為他們對員工也有責任
But I also like to think they got some kind of commitment to their people.

708
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:40,120
你這番話留在廣告活動上說吧
You can save that speech for your ad campaign.

709
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:43,290
這公司唯一在乎的就是金錢
This company's commitment is to the almighty dollar.

710
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:47,085
你想下,如果我們實情相告
If you think, based on what we've told them, that Tri-Oceanic

711
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:50,839
三大洋公司會只為了救我們，而冒在市場上受損的潛在風險嗎
is gonna risk exposing themself to potential market loss just to save us

712
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,342
在你的工作經歷上會是次大開眼界的
you're in for an eye-opening experience.

713
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:56,303
也許
Maybe.

714
00:57:56,304 --> 00:58:00,057
也許會，我知道你的生活總是一團糟, 醫生
Maybe so. And I know your life's gone a couple of bad rounds, Doc.

715
00:58:00,058 --> 00:58:05,058
但這不一定表示這公司就是一大垃圾堆
But it doesn't necessarily mean this whole company's one big bummer.

716
00:58:26,709 --> 00:58:31,709
我認為我們在這能拿些東西
I think we got something here.

717
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:36,839
他媽的
Son of a bitch.

718
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:40,973
我拿不到，他們為什麼要把它放在伏特加里?
I don't get it. Why did they put it in the vodka?

719
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:42,474
因為那是實驗
It was an experiment, man.

720
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:45,519
我是說, 他們有意把藥物或其他什麼放進伏特加里
I mean, they put the drug or whatever it was in the vodka!

721
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,521
然後引人喝下去
They meant to trick them into takin' it.

722
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:50,399
這麼一來他們不知喝了什麼
That way, see, they didn't know what they were drinkin'.

723
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,944
可能他們在我們的咖啡堣]放了
I <i>mean,</i> with us, they would have put it in the coffee.

724
00:58:53,945 --> 00:58:56,363
- 你想說什麼? - 來吧
- What are you talkin' about? - Come on, man.

725
00:58:56,364 --> 00:59:00,367
你也知有些母親把蓖麻混進橙汁
You know how mothers put the castor oil in with orange juice?

726
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:03,412
引誘孩子不知不覺的喝下去
They trick the baby into drinkin' it so he don't know what he's drinkin.

727
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:06,873
這就是他們在做的,夥計!
That's the kind of shit they was doin', man!

728
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:08,917
愚蠢，他們可能把我們全害死
Fool. He could've got us all killed.

729
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:11,837
你的夥計們喝伏特加時可沒這麼神聖
You guys weren't <i>so</i> holy when you were shooting that vodka.

730
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:13,005
受害的可能是任何人
It could've been anyone.

731
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:16,216
好了, 高大強壯的女士，這事似乎麻煩到你了
Well, Miss High and Mighty, it doesn't seem to bother you none.

732
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,301
是的，是煩到了
Yeah, it bothers me.

733
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:20,971
你有你的處事方式，我也有我的
You deal with it your way. I'll deal with it mine.

734
00:59:20,972 --> 00:59:25,475
你知道在格施塔德有個64平方英里的滑雪場嗎
You know that in Gstaad they have 64 square miles of ski slopes?

735
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:30,022
64平方英里呢
Sixty-four square miles.

736
00:59:30,023 --> 00:59:34,151
在我們剛剛經歷了那些事，你怎麼還有心情坐這談滑雪
How can you sit there goin', "Shh, shh," after what we just went through?

737
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:37,529
另外，我已聽夠你談滑雪了
And another thing, man. I'm gettin' tired of hearin' about your goddamn skiin' OK?

738
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,742
夥計，你一點都不懂滑雪的事，人們可不會去西班牙滑雪的
You don't know shit about skiin', man. They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

739
00:59:41,743 --> 00:59:43,744
我們剛才所見的事又怎麼樣?
What about what we just saw?

740
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:47,956
就像威莉說的,我們各有處事方法
Like Willie <i>said,</i> you deal with it your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

741
00:59:47,957 --> 00:59:52,957
- 難道沒人關心所發生的事嗎？ - 你想怎樣來對付它，啊？
- Doesn't anybody care what just happened? - What're you gonna do about it? Huh?

742
00:59:53,254 --> 00:59:58,254
希克斯派克和褒曼死了
Sixpack and Bow are dead.

743
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:05,219
對所發生的事我也無能為力，難道你行嗎?
I can't help what happened. Can you?

744
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:09,728
我要去找些東西吃,還有誰要吃東西嗎？
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat. Anybody want anything?

745
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:14,729
吃? 你還有心情吃東西？
Eat? After what we just went through?

746
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:34,544
颶風正朝這兒吹來
The storm's still holding its course.

747
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:38,256
還有這疾病，只有一個人染上了?
What about that disease? Still just the one crew member?

748
01:00:38,257 --> 01:00:43,257
對,還只是一人
No change. Still just the one.

749
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:12,833
每個人都很緊張不安,你在幹什麼？
Hey, man, everybody's jumpy. What are you doin'?

750
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:14,835
找些黃油來做爆米花
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

751
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:19,548
聽著，你是要我自己一個人解決這個難題，還是怎麼的?
Look, Hazy, you gonna make me finish this puzzle by myself, or what?

752
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:22,759
我會的，你知道這要我花多長時間嗎？
I should. You know how long that took me?

753
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,760
許多許多個小時
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

754
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:33,432
- 我去去就回 - 好，快點
- I'll be right there. - Okay. Hurry up.

755
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:51,538
(Hissing)

756
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:56,539
(Screaming)

757
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:12,555
(Screaming)

758
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:18,899
該死!
Holy shit!

759
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,900
拜託，天哪, 救我！救我, 鐘斯!
Please, God, help me! Help me, Jonesy! Help me.

760
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:27,782
我去找人幫忙,很快回來,好嗎？
I'm gonna go get some help. I'll be right back, okay?

761
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:32,783
別離開我，鐘斯,不要離開我!
Don't leave me. Jonesy, don't leave me!

762
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:37,830
- 求你了 - 我很快回來
- Please. - I'll be back.

763
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:44,674
瞧! 它抓住了德休斯!待在這看好門
Look! It's got Hazy! Stay here and watch the door!

764
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:49,675
別放它出來,我去找醫生
Don't let him out! I'm gonna go get the doc.

765
01:02:59,023 --> 01:03:01,066
我不想對她說褒曼的事
I didn't want to tell her about Bowman.

766
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:03,610
我聽瑪蒂說,我知道她胡說八道
I listened to Martin, and all my mind says "She's full of shit."

767
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:08,611
它抓住了德休斯!快來!
It's got DeJesus! Come on!

768
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,103
貝克,別進去，別碰任何東西
Beck, don't go in there. Don't touch anything!

769
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:39,938
德休斯! 柯布!
DeJesus! Cobb!

770
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:42,565
你該死的做了什麼？ 你該在看好門的
What the hell you doin'? You supposed to be watchin' the door!

771
01:03:42,566 --> 01:03:44,693
沒有保護我才不會
I'm not gonna watch that thing without some protection.

772
01:03:44,694 --> 01:03:47,028
- 那東西是我的朋友 - 你朋友已經不是人類了
- That thing is my friend. - Your friend is not human!

773
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:49,614
別吵了,住嘴!鐘斯! 讓我們去找他
Shut up, both of you! Jones! Let's go find him.

774
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:54,536
走吧，我們去找他 等下，威莉呢?
Okay? Come on. Let's go find him. Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

775
01:03:54,537 --> 01:03:57,622
發生什麼事？
What's happening?

776
01:03:57,623 --> 01:03:59,874
我的天,她在外面
My God, she's out there.

777
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,876
好吧. 鐘斯你跟我來
All right, look. Jones, you come with me.

778
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:06,877
醫生,你和柯布去檢查辦公室和宿舍，來吧
Doc, you and Cobb check your office and the dorm. Let's go.

779
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:33,784
威莉?
Willie?

780
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,795
嗨, 貝克
Hey, Beck.

781
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:47,797
噢，不，是她的圍巾
Oh, no. It's her scarf.

782
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:51,009
對不起,你們在這兒做什麼？
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

783
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:54,554
- 你該死的在這做什麼？ - 我在試著修好這些燈
- What the hell you doin'? - I've been trying to fix these lights.

784
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:55,638
發生了什麼?
What's going on?

785
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:58,350
殺死希克斯派克和褒曼的東西還在這
Whatever got Sixpack and Bowman is still here.

786
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:03,351
- 什麼? - 它剛抓了德休斯
- What? - Lt just got DeJesus.

787
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:30,840
說話啊，我們在和呆子說話
All right. We're talkin' turkey.

788
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:34,511
德休斯!嘿!
DeJesus! Hey!

789
01:05:34,512 --> 01:05:37,555
醫生
Doc.

790
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:42,556
噢，天哪
Oh, my God.

791
01:05:44,605 --> 01:05:47,816
血袋
The blood supply.

792
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:50,318
老天
Oh, my God.

793
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:55,319
它拿走了血袋
It got the blood supply.

794
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:19,677
(Screaming)

795
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:46,416
它在長，它要吃東西
It's growing. It's had a meal.

796
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:49,043
- 它吃血？ - 顯然是的
- It needs blood? - Apparently.

797
01:06:49,044 --> 01:06:53,047
太棒了，你是說，我們中間有人是吸血鬼嗎
This is great. You're tellin' me we got a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

798
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:56,134
這就是為什麼那艘船上的人死了，它需要血
That's why that one on the ship was dead. It needed blood.

799
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:57,260
哪艘船？
What one on that ship?

800
01:06:57,261 --> 01:07:00,638
有人要洩露你的小秘密了?
Somebody want to let the rank-and-file in on your little secret?

801
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,266
不管怎樣，這看起來就像遺傳變異
Whatever it is, it appears to be a genetic aberration.

802
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:06,978
- 別廢話 - 你要告訴我們什麼, 醫生?
- No shit. - What're you trying to tell us, Doc?

803
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:11,979
它有深海生物的各種特徵,有鱗，有鰓...
It has all the characteristics of deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

804
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:17,947
它不停地在再生，甚至在短暫的蟄伏期內
regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

805
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:20,950
而且它記得血庫在哪兒
But the fact that it remembered where that plasma was stored

806
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:24,704
似乎它還有其他物質
seems to imply that is has some other quality.

807
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:27,832
- 什麼? - 它能吸取受害者的智慧
- What? - Lt absorbs the intelligence of its victim.

808
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,251
智慧這個詞來描述可能不大準確
Intelligence may not be the right word.

809
01:07:30,252 --> 01:07:31,920
別該死的咬文嚼字了, 醫生 你想說什麼?
The hell with semantics, Doc. What are you saying, now?

810
01:07:31,921 --> 01:07:35,131
那東西有德休斯,希克斯派克，褒曼的部分智慧?
This thing is part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman, what?

811
01:07:35,132 --> 01:07:38,968
我不太清楚，我只是猜的
I don't know. I'd just be guessing.

812
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:41,179
但我明白的是
But I do know this:

813
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:46,180
俄國人為了自保而弄沉了自己的船
The Russians deliberately sank that ship to protect themselves.

814
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:48,978
也許是為了保護我們
Maybe to protect us all.

815
01:07:48,979 --> 01:07:51,314
好吧，是為了保護我們
Alright. Then I say we protect ourselves.

816
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:53,858
讓我們去逃生氣泡艙，趕快離開這該死的地方
Let's escape into those air bubbles and get the hell out of here.

817
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:55,777
去迎面碰颶風？
And hit the surface in the middle of a hurricane?

818
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:57,278
夥計，颶風會把氣泡艙打成碎片的
Man, that storm'd rip those bubbles to pieces.

819
01:07:57,279 --> 01:08:02,279
- 他們永不會找到我們 - 我們根本沒有生還機會
- They'd never find us. - We wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell.

820
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:07,205
- 那我們該怎麼辦 - 聽著，我們還有一個機會
- So what are we gonna do? - Look, I think we got one shot.

821
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:11,709
只有一個，我們把它引到洗礦池堙A然後像洗礦那樣沖掉它
Just one shot. We lure it down into the swamp, flush it out just like the other.

822
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,710
我們該怎樣進行？
And how're we gonna do that?

823
01:08:21,178 --> 01:08:24,013
那麼我們半小時後集合
So we rendezvous in the mess in 30 minutes.

824
01:08:24,014 --> 01:08:27,225
柯布先生,對下時間，30分鐘
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

825
01:08:27,226 --> 01:08:28,977
- 馬克,聽到了嗎？ - 收到
- Mark. Got it? - Got it.

826
01:08:28,978 --> 01:08:31,479
好的,我再說一次
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

827
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,816
如果鐘斯和我三十分鐘後還回不到這食堂
If Jones and I aren't back here in 30 minutes in the mess,

828
01:08:34,817 --> 01:08:37,819
不管有沒有颶風,你們都要進到氣泡艙離開這
hurricane or nothin', you get in those escape bubbles and haul ass.

829
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,820
- 明白嗎 - 明白
' Okay? ' Okay_.

830
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:41,531
- 讓我們來吧 - 都當心點
- Let's do it. - Be careful with this.

831
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:44,242
- 別擔心，我不會再放棄什麼的 - 保重
- Don't worry. I don't want to give up any more. - Take care.

832
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:46,494
我盡力而為
I'll do my best.

833
01:08:46,495 --> 01:08:51,495
好的，來吧
Okay, let's go.

834
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:39,589
你知道嗎, 我以前很棒的
You know, I was quite good once.

835
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:44,590
我以前做了很多重要的事?
When I did something, it was important, you know?

836
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:50,266
我發明了幾種藥物還有專利
I developed drugs and techniques

837
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:55,267
世界各地的醫生每天都會用到
that're used every day by doctors all over the world.

838
01:09:55,606 --> 01:10:00,606
- 這是有區別的 - 一直都是, 醫生
- Made a difference. - Lt still does, Doc.

839
01:10:02,821 --> 01:10:07,821
這癢得要命
This itches like hell.

840
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:11,579
- 我還好 - 讓我看看
- I'm all right. - Let me have a look.

841
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:16,580
真的很癢
It really itches.

842
01:10:16,835 --> 01:10:20,129
那因為它在痊癒
That's because it's healing.

843
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,548
我給你換藥,看能否使你舒服點
I'm gonna change that dressing, see if I can't make you more comfortable.

844
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:25,134
- 你要去哪, 醫生? - 醫務室
- Where are you going, Doc? - The infirmary.

845
01:10:25,135 --> 01:10:26,678
不用任何保護?
Without protection?

846
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:31,679
- 你不該到外面去 - 她說的對
- You shouldn't go out there. - She's right, you know.

847
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:56,984
緊急逃生氣泡艙、準備啟動

848
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,738
啟動

849
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:23,290
(Muffled booming)

850
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:27,757
- 你聽到了嗎? - 聽到了
- You hear that? - I hear it.

851
01:12:27,758 --> 01:12:32,758
我們走
Here we go.

852
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:59,747
- 脫下你的襯衣, 柯布 - 好的
- Take off your shirt, Cobb. - Sure.

853
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:03,668
我覺得很冷
I'm cold.

854
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:05,920
請救我
Help me, please.

855
01:13:05,921 --> 01:13:10,921
哦，好的
Oh, yeah, sure.

856
01:13:16,306 --> 01:13:18,349
醫生? 醫生!
<i>Doc? Doc!</i>

857
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,935
救我!
Help me!

858
01:13:20,936 --> 01:13:22,645
怎麼回事?
What's happening?

859
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:23,146
救命!
Help!

860
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:29,735
醫生
Doc.

861
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:34,736
(Screaming)

862
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:42,456
- 貝克! 鐘斯! - 威莉!
- Beck! Jones! - Willie!

863
01:13:42,457 --> 01:13:43,069
(Roaring)

864
01:13:47,629 --> 01:13:50,214
- 威莉，快跑! - 跑!
- Willie! Run! - Run!

865
01:13:50,215 --> 01:13:52,258
快從那離開!
Get over here!

866
01:13:52,259 --> 01:13:52,759
威莉!
Willie!

867
01:14:08,442 --> 01:14:12,069
(Screaming)

868
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,281
你怎麼樣，還好吧? 醫生和柯布在哪?
How are you doin'? All right? Where's Doc and Cobb?

869
01:14:15,282 --> 01:14:17,491
- 它抓到了醫生 - 等會，它剛就在那
- It got Doc. - Wait a minute. It was just here.

870
01:14:17,492 --> 01:14:20,453
- 我知道 - 等下，你看到它了?
- I know. - Wait a second. You saw it?

871
01:14:20,454 --> 01:14:25,454
- 是柯布，它在他身體堶 - 慢慢說，你是說它們有2個?
- It was in Cobb. It was in him. - Slow down. There's two of them?

872
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,169
- 見鬼 - 好吧
- Shit. - All right.

873
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:30,796
- 你怎麼樣? - 還好
- How are you doin'? - Okay.

874
01:14:30,797 --> 01:14:33,382
好，現在怎麼辦?
<i>Okay, now what?</i>

875
01:14:33,383 --> 01:14:36,719
你對巨型海浪有什麼感受?
How do you feel about big waves?

876
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:41,720
我喜歡海浪
I love waves.

877
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:17,009
我們被困住了,逃生氣泡艙不見了
We're trapped. The escape bubbles are gone.

878
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,095
- 威莉, 那扇門 - 嘿,看這個
- Willie, the door. - Hey, look at this.

879
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:21,138
我非常清楚我的最後決定
"I am fully aware of the finality of my decision."

880
01:15:21,139 --> 01:15:24,433
我希望我們的犧牲能使人類
It is my hope that our sacrifice will mean that the human race

881
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:26,477
永遠不知道這可怕的突變
"will never know this awful mutation."

882
01:15:26,478 --> 01:15:31,478
- 這簡直就是我們得死刑令 - 是由那個好好醫生簽的字
- Our death warrant. - Signed by the good doctor.

883
01:15:41,827 --> 01:15:46,372
去他的吧
Hell with it.

884
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:48,582
- 你在幹嗎? - 好了...
- What are you doing? - Well...

885
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:53,583
我要看看我們目前的情況有多糟？
I'm gonna find out just how far up Shit Creek we are.

886
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:06,350
- 謝天謝地你還活著。 - 你到哪去了?
- Thank goodness you're still alive. - Where you been?

887
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:09,437
嘿, 你們最好現在過來救我們，立刻!
Hey man, you better get your ass out here now and get us. Right now!

888
01:16:09,438 --> 01:16:12,606
拜託，鐘斯,冷靜，我們還沒打算拋棄你
Please, Mr. Jones, calm down. We haven't deserted you.

889
01:16:12,607 --> 01:16:15,985
當我們收到湯普生醫生的資訊後，我們自然很擔心你們
Naturally, after we received Dr. Thompson's message, we were concerned.

890
01:16:15,986 --> 01:16:18,237
但我們絕不會拋下你們
But we never would have deserted you.

891
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:19,905
你們什麼時候能到?
When are you coming?

892
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:23,242
- 你說的十二個小時,還記得嗎? - 好吧，但有個壞消息
- You said 12 hours, remember? - Well, that's the bad news.

893
01:16:23,243 --> 01:16:27,079
颶風正轉向你的方向，就現在，正在轉向...
The hurricane has turned your way. Right now, it's on a course of...

894
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,874
你該死的只管回答我的問題,你們什麼時候能來
Just answer the goddamn question. When are you coming?

895
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,127
- 希望48小時後能到吧 - 48小時?
- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours. - Forty-eight hours?

896
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:35,546
我明白你們一定很難接受
I realize you must have gone through hell...

897
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:37,631
混蛋，我們還在這遭難
Gone? Bitch, we're still here!

898
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:40,676
我又不能控制天氣，不過放心
I can't control the weather. Now, rest assured your SOS

901
01:16:47,309 --> 01:16:49,018
別對我們信誓旦旦了
Just don't promise us nothin'.

902
01:16:49,019 --> 01:16:52,605
當你們經歷這些後還對你們這麼說，的確有些荒謬
I realize this must sound ridiculous after what you've been through.

903
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:55,733
- 別廢話了 - 儘量去休息下吧
- No shit. - Now please try and get some rest.

904
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:58,861
該死的我們怎麼去休息？我是睡不著，你能睡著嗎?
How in the hell are we gonna get some rest? I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

905
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:01,447
- 去休息? - 省省吧
- Get some rest? - Save your breath.

906
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:05,409
- 該死，要48小時?沒門 - 我們別無選擇，有嗎?
- Damn. In 48 hours? No way. - We don't have much choice, do we?

907
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,871
我來告訴你怎麼辦，你們去休息，我來看著
I'll tell you what. I'll take a watch. You all try to get some rest.

908
01:17:08,872 --> 01:17:13,872
我今生今世再也睡不著了
I ain't gonna never be able to sleep again. In life. Ever.

- Oh, man. - They know, don't they?

913
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:23,191
是的，我想他們此刻大概在想怎麼對付我們
Yeah. I think they're just sittin' up there, decidin' what to do with us.

914
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:26,490
也許他們已經想好了
Maybe they already have.

915
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:30,369
- 你要找什麼？ - 我得看看投資得益如何？
- What're you looking for? - I'm seeing how my investment's doing.

916
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:33,247

925
01:18:56,771 --> 01:18:58,898
歡迎加入,老闆
Welcome to the union, boss.

926
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:02,151
我們無足輕重
We're all expendable.

927

- 醫生, 我欠你5塊錢 - 5塊錢?
- Doc, I owe you five dollars. - Five dollars?

928

929
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,786
- 內爆倒計時 - 供氧停了

你不能從那出去，這正是它所希望的
You can't go out there. That's what it wants.

939
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:45,110
好吧,如果我們在這堨╞h足夠的空氣，內壓會下降，然後會收縮
Yeah, well, if we lose enough air in here, the internal pressure will drop, and crunch.

940
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:46,779

現在想想!我們該怎麼辦?
