1
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:29,661
<i>Four to shack.
Container 14 ready to winch.</i>

2
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:34,832
<i>Six to shack.
Silver extraction completed.</i>

3
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:42,260
<i>That's good eating.
Burritos, enchiladas...</i>

4
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:46,181
<i>Black beans and rice, man. That's
Puerto Rican. Hey, I gotta take you...</i>

5
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,559
Well, I hate to break up
the great Latino gourmet debate...

6
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,562
but we ain't off
the clock yet, <i>so</i> uh...

7
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:56,983
Since we got a few more days here,
can somebody...

8
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:59,986
please tell me who the hook is?

9
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:02,572
Fifteen, is that you?

10
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:05,701
You got a hook on box 22?

11
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,662
The man is asking you
if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit.

12
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:11,081
Watch your mouth, Sixpack.
Fifteen to shack.

13
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:13,291
This is Jones. I ain't the hook.

14
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,293
Seven to shack. I'm the hook.

15
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:18,171
Okay there, seven.
Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

16
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:21,299
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or
something? We're all waitin' on ya honey.

17
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Go suck on a shrimp, Sixpack.

18
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:34,187
Seven to shack. Ready to winch.

19
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:39,188
There we go. Winch on.

20
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,321
Okay, miners, let's come on home.

21
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,198
You heard the man.
Let's get movin' folks.

22
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,492
Come on, guys.
We only have three days left.

23
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:52,493
I hear that.

24
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:03,129
Put the kettle on, Beck.
We're coming home.

25
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,321
Well, Doc,
not so as you'd notice

26
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,865
but the sun has set
on yet another day

27
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:30,243
of hard labor and toil
here at the homestead.

28
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:34,164
Sixteen tons and what do you get.

29
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,917
Another day older
and deeper in debt

30
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,545
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'cause I can't go

31
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:45,546
I owe my soul to the company store.

32
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:56,186
Jonesy! Help!

33
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:57,604
Cobb!

34
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:00,232
My rebreather's stopped!
I'm losing compression!

35
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,150
I'm gonna blow my suit!
Doc! Beck!

36
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,945
Yeah, I got you, DeJesus.
You look fine from in here.

37
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,322
- Give me a readout.
- My rebreather's stopped!

38
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:10,158
I'm losing compression!
I can't breathe!

39
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,701
Mr. DeJesus, I can't...

40
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,037
I can't get an accurate readout
if you panic.

41
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,415
Doc, we got an emergency here.
We need you. Got trouble.

42
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,709
Doc! Doc!

43
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,088
So just breathe slowly
and through your nose and uh...

44
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,340
and out through your mouth.

45
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,425
I think you're hyperventilating.

46
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:30,720
- Hyperventilating, my ass!
- How do you do this?

47
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,764
- He's gonna blow.
- No, he's not gonna blow!

48
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:35,267
(coughing) Doc! Beck!

49
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:40,268
- Help!
- Doc, come on!

50
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:42,941
- Check his oxygen level.
- Yeah, I'm doin' that.

51
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:47,942
- Do something, quick!
- I'm doin' it.

52
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,202
Help!

53
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:57,038
Damn!

54
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,082
Hook him to my RV-four transpac.

55
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,293
Right. Hook him to the RV...

56
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:04,254
No! Don't do that!
Don't circumventilate him.

57
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:07,048
I think you're risking
an implosion probability.

58
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,968
Doc, we need you.
Bring him into the shack.

59
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:13,054
- There's not enough time!
- You've got time. Just do it.

60
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,681
I'm gonna die!

61
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:19,682
You ain't gonna die.

62
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:28,691
Just keep him moving.

63
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:34,071
Take it easy. We'll make it.
We'll make it.

64
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:40,578
Open the damn door.

65
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:46,125
Come on! Get him inside!

66
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:57,511
Keep him moving.

67
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,608
Come on, lift lock. Go.

68
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:11,609
Come on, lift lock. Up.

69
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:14,467
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that
doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

70
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:17,345
It ain't the goddamn suit, man.
It's Beck.

71
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:20,015
It's not his fault.
Doc should've been there.

72
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,225
If he was a real shack boss,
Doc would have been there.

73
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,935
He got real lucky this time.

74
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:28,936
Hey, Wall Street broke
the 15,000-point barrier today.

75
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,777
Shit. There goes my bonus.

76
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,530
You know, I stood next to a guy
who blew a suit once.

77
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,950
He was in the Indian Ocean. Boy, I'm
telling you that is not a pretty sight.

78
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,285
Hey, leave Hazy alone, man.

79
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:43,997
One tiny little hole in the
fucking toe of his suit man.

80
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,416
No bigger than your click.

81
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,793
Yeah, boy, that ocean came in.

82
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:52,964
The pressure just crammed
his whole body up into his helmet.

83
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:57,135
We just buried his helmet.

84
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:01,181
- That would've been you, DeJesus.
- Hey, I know about implosion.

85
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:04,768
Yeah, I bet you do.
I bet you was imploding in your pants.

86
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,979
- Knock it off, Sixpack!
- Cut it out, you guys.

87
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,857
We've been stuck down in this
hole for a hell of a long time

88
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:15,028
and we had a close call. We're not gonna
let something like this break us apart.

89
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,783
The doc is my responsibility.

90
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:23,244
The doc is my responsibility.

91
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:23,857
Bullshit.

92
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:35,711
(Groaning and creaking)

93
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:44,599
God, it would be just my luck to finish two
months' worth of work two miles under

94
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,477
and have the whole place fall apart
with just three days left.

95
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,187
- Anyone check weather up top?
- Yeah.

96
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,898
It's raining, but it's
supposed to be clear for pickup.

97
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,942
As long as there's no waves.
I hate waves.

98
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:58,196
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd
be doin' if you were up top right now?

99
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:00,281
- Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy.
- Oh, Sixpack!

100
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:04,077
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic?
- Hey, wherever I can find it.

101
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,079
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

102
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,915
Be watching news on TV that's so bad,
it makes you nauseous.

103
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,210
So bad that you get in your car
to get some fresh air

104
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,462
and after five minutes,
you realize

105
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,674
the air's so dirty,
you can't breathe.

106
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:21,427
If you're lucky enough
to get back to your house...

107
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:24,139
that looks the same
as everybody else's...

108
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,350
you find that your wife
is as fat as she ever was.

109
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:29,644
And the only reason your kids
aren't strung out on the drugs

110
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:32,730
they were using is because
they've found some new drugs

111
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,109
which screw 'em up even more,
and that's just the good part.

112
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,822
You people just don't appreciate
how good you've got it down here.

113
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,117
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb.
- That's all right, sir. I was just finished.

114
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:47,579
- How are you feeling there, DeJesus?
- I'm okay.

115
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,081
- See the doc yet?
- No.

116
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,584
Well, you better let the doc
take a look at you after dinner.

117
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:55,128
- Since he was busy earlier.
- When we needed him.

118
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,630
Why don't you let me
handle the doc.

119
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:01,676
Makes me feel better already.

120
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:05,096
I was looking at the shack
maintenance hours outstanding.

121
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,515
I see where this is going.

122
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:10,602
Well, um, see, all of us owe
some shack maintenance time.

123
00:12:10,603 --> 00:12:12,228
I thought tonight would
be a good time to get it done.

124
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:15,148
No way, Mr. Beck.
No bleepin' way.

125
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,357
We just pulled a full shift.

126
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:18,443
You can't call shack duty
on top of a full shift.

127
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:20,445
That's a union violation.
It's in the contract.

128
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:23,156
Right on, Cobb.
Let's hear it for the shop steward.

129
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:24,032
Woo!

130
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,035
Hear that, Becky? The company's
got to abide by the rules.

131
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:30,288
I know about the contract, Mr. Cobb,
and the deal is you can follow the letter

132
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,832
of the contract to the law and you can
spend an extra workday gettin' it done

133
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,418
or you can get it done tonight
and call tomorrow a down day.

134
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,630
- What, are you giving us the day off?
- Looks that way.

135
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:40,757
What about our quota?

136
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,676
You're only 25 tons off quota.

137
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,221
You're bound to go way
over that by the last day.

138
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:49,933
Look, folks, it's just a day off.
It don't make no difference to me.

139
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,518
It's just up to you.
I thought it might be good.

140
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,812
- Hell, I could use a day off.
- Me too.

141
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:59,813
- What the hell.
- Okay, shop steward's three.

142
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,321
- Four.
- Four. Anybody else?

143
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:07,158
- Six.
- All right, here's what we got.

144
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,827
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle
in the air duct Somewhere.

145
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,829
- Take a look at that.
- Okay.

146
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,874
Williams, run a diagnostic
on DeJesus' suit.

147
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,044
- Anybody else got any suit problems?
- Yeah, my pocket.

148
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:23,045
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

149
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:27,262
Good evening. Name's Thompson.
Party of one.

150
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:30,723
My reservation was 8:15.
Not too near the Orchestra, please.

151
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,767
Are you gonna come
to work tomorrow, Doc?

152
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,769
Well, I'll be on the golf
course in the morning.

153
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,896
Then, if I don't have
any babies to deliver

154
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,357
I could stop by after lunch.

155
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:43,820
We almost had an accident today.
DeJesus's suit.

156
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,863
You have something to say to me?

157
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:48,241
Yeah. Section 1412

158
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:50,827
of the Tri-Oceanic manual requires

159
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,706
a mining shack's medical officer
to be present in the control room

160
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:57,041
during all exterior operations.

161
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:02,042
I just wanna make real
damn sure that's clear.

162
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:10,551
I'll keep it to nine holes
in the morning.

163
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,390
Thank you, sir, for taking
care of that situation.

164
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:03,441
- Listen to it, for Christ's sake.
- It's just gettin' old, that's all.

165
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:08,029
You don't see Doc opening me up
every time my joints start to creak.

166
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,282
As long as it's recycling
the air, let it be. Come on.

167
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:16,283
Ten to one it's a short.

168
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:16,997
<i>Okay-</i>

169
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,671
Piece of cake.

170
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,928
Great.

171
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:07,964
Oh, mama! What a pair.

172
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,842
What'd you say?

173
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:12,969
I said, "What a pair."

174
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,849
Our shack boss and his washed-up
doctor buddy make quite a...

175
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,850
- What did you think I said?
- That you liked my boobs.

176
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,314
(Machine rattling)

177
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:30,315
You watch the old Cobb magic,
all right?

178
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:35,362
Compliments of Bowman.

179
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,166
(Rattling quiets down)

180
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:43,667
Yeah.

181
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,425
How in the hell did you do that?

182
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:55,761
You don't say anything to anybody.
Job security.

183
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:58,473
All right? Let's go.

184
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:03,474
Now, wait a minute, man.
How in the hell did you do that?

185
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:10,109
That's clean.

186
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,110
But there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, my God!

187
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,911
Come here, Kuki.

188
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,287
Here, Kuki.

189
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:26,288
Sixpack, you shit!

190
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,295
Surprise!

191
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:32,298
How much silver are we gonna
start taking out of that mine again?

192
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,717
Well, it's like I tell you, Martin,
I think you've got an honest-to-God

193
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,135
bonanza on your hands.

194
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,971
You can haul us out in a couple of days.
This mine will play itself.

195
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,557
When I told the Director
of Atlantic Operations

196
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,020
that <i>we</i> had to stick a geologist
down there and turn that mine around...

197
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:49,899
I had no idea that you were
going to prove me a genius.

198
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,944
- Well, I'm glad you're happy, Martin.
- I'm ecstatic.

199
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,112
'Cause I can't wait
to get the fuck outta here.

200
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,614
What?

201
00:17:56,615 --> 00:18:00,451
I said, I really can't wait
to get back to exploration diving.

202
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:02,453
I miss the research, and...

203
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:06,040
By the way, I ran that check
on Dr. Thompson.

204
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,960
He has a few incidences
of insubordination

205
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:12,838
but his credentials
are very impressive.

206
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,175
Pharmacology.
He pioneered several vaccines.

207
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:19,345
Well, this ain't the Mayo Clinic.
How'd he get down here, Martin?

208
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,681
A serum he developed
killed several people.

209
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:24,976
An accident, but it got blown
all out of proportion.

210
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:26,435
Now, look, Beck.

211
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,938
Things are beginning
to move very fast now.

212
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,983
If you're having a problem with him
or you need any help...

213
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,318
just say the word.

214
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,571
No.

215
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:39,031
No, I don't think
it's anything I can't handle.

216
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:42,910
Good.

217
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:45,955
How are your stocks doin'?
Haven't you made your million yet?

218
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:48,165
Not yet.

219
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:52,962
- How's Tri-Oceanic doing, Bow?
- Got money in this tub?

220
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:56,549
Yeah. I signed up
for the stock option.

221
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,384
You know, last year
when they lost a tanker,

222
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:01,178
the bottom fell out of their stock
and I lost a bloody fortune.

223
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:06,179
You take your money too seriously.

224
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:13,604
(Structure groaning and creaking)

225
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,030
You're damn right, I do.
I'm not down here for fun.

226
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:26,495
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

227
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,747
(Wolf whistle)

228
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,124
Whew, look at those white legs!

229
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,544
Hey, Willie, honey, I'm sorry
about that little incident tonight.

230
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:38,545
You know, I just thought
a little humor might loosen things up.

231
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,178
Hey, watch it, Sixpack!

232
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,596
No hard feelings?

233
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:48,597
Nope. Sweet dreams.

234
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:55,562
I got a date with an angel.

235
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:05,993
Come on, baby.

236
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:10,994
Sit on my face.

237
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:17,501
(Screaming)

238
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:21,926
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

239
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:25,596
You bitch, look at my foot!
Look at my goddamn foot!

240
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:28,140
- I thought you'd find that funny.
- You think it's funny?

241
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,643
You're gonna think it's funny
when you eat this goddamn thing!

242
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:33,562
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Look at my foot!

243
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:36,357
This bitch put a goddamn
sea monster in my bunk!

244
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,818
- How do you know it was her?
- Lt was her, goddammit!

245
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,862
- Are you calling me a liar, Beck?
- That may be the size of it, Bubba.

246
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:45,616
- You and Williams just pulled sea duty tomorrow.
- Oh, bullshit!

247
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:49,078
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

248
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,079
You just got half a day.
Any more hoopla, it's a full one.

249
00:20:56,461 --> 00:21:01,461
Ready to drill.

250
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,301
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

251
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:09,302
- Let's blow it.
- Blow this.

252
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,475
Charge activated.

253
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:14,103
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

254
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:19,104
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

255
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:20,138
Oh, yeah!

256
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:33,243
<i>It looks like the mother load, guys.</i>

257
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:38,419
I need more light on that, seven.

258
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,298
Sixpack, you hear that?
We need more light.

259
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,801
Sixpack? Sixpack?

260
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:48,220
All right, look.

261
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:49,722
The cable's stuck.

262
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:54,723
(Screaming)

263
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:02,067
Sixpack.
Sixpack, what's happened?

264
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:04,904
We've lost him.

265
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:07,865
Well, what are you doing?
Having a party out there, Sixpack?

266
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:12,866
Beck, I'm looking for him.

267
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:21,082
Shack to seven.
What's going on out there, Williams?

268
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,340
He's gone.

269
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:29,341
Williams, speak to me.
What's happening out there?

270
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:32,723
Sixpack. Sixpack, answer.

271
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,558
Oh, my God!

272
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,477
Williams!

273
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:40,523
Come on, Williams.
What's the alternate?

274
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,525
Try 35.

275
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:47,526
Williams? There she is.

276
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:50,741
Williams, you hear me?
What's going on out there?

277
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:55,742
God, he's gone over the South Ridge.

278
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,084
I'm going down after him.

279
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:02,795
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know
what the hell is off that ridge.

280
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:07,796
Come on, Jonesy, work it out.

281
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:10,553
- Sixpack's lost!
- Weren't they tied?

282
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,555
- I don't know, he's lost!
- They're supposed to be tied.

283
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:15,099
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move it!

284
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,644
Oh, God!

285
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,150
What've we got?

286
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:34,573
- Tube worms.
- How's she gonna get out of there?

287
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:42,126
Bowman, what's the self-contained
air capacity of that suit?

288
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:47,127
Thirty minutes.

289
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:52,636
(Heavy radio interference)
This is six to shack.

290
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:55,055
Six to shack.

291
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:56,557
Sixpack.

292
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,810
For God's sakes, why doesn't
Sixpack have his blinkers on?

293
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:04,811
The man could be two feet away
and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

294
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,488
What?

295
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:16,118
What is this?

296
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:16,619
A ship?

297
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:53,697
That's Russian.

298
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,532
Are you picking this up?

299
00:24:55,533 --> 00:25:00,533
Yeah, we got it, Seven. Can you
open up that picture a little for us?

300
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,207
Leviathan.

301
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:06,502
- What?
- Leviathan.

302
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:10,506
- Bowman, run a check.
- Sir.

303
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:13,926
- Williams, What's your air reading?
- Twenty minutes.

304
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:16,679
We're gonna give you five,
then we're coming in.

305
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

306
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:33,149
I'm going inside.

307
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:36,535
Sixpack.

308
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:46,246
Sixpack, answer me!

309
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:57,424
Baltic Sea?

310
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,312
What have you got there, Bowman?

311
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:11,066
The Leviathan. Currently with
the Russian Fleet in the Baltic Sea.

312
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:14,319
Currently horseshit. Currently it's
rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

313
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,449
Well, it's gotta be wrong.
Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

314
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,617
It's right here. The Baltic Sea.

315
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:24,872
Maybe a ship sinks
and they don't notice it's missing.

316
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:29,873
Williams, you got one minute to find
Sixpack and get your butt out of there.

317
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:38,757
If Willie's got a minute,
how much time does Sixpack have?

318
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:17,629
The infirmary.

319
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,739
Whoooo!

320
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,616
I'm rich, honey!

321
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:45,202
I'm rich!

322
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:48,705
Safety negligence?
I never even heard a word.

323
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:50,249
How can I be on report if I
never even heard a word?

324
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,416
Ain't that right, Cobby?

325
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:54,211
Don't Cobby me.
You're on your own this time, Sixpack.

326
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:57,089
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

327
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,008
A Timex. And it's still ticking.

328
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,387
A little Russian money.
It don't look like much.

329
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:07,724
Here's something for you, Bow.

330
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:11,270
Hey, Sixpack,
look at your girlfriends.

331
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:11,771
Whew!

332
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:24,616
- What's that?
- "Kitty Does Kiev."

333
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:26,410
- Porn. Right up your alley.
- Let me see that.

334
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,287
It's in Russian.
I don't know what it says.

335
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:33,288
- May I see it, please?
- Doc, it's not really "Kitty Does Kiev."

336
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:38,088
- It's the captain's log on videotape.
- Don't tell me you read Russian.

337
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,300
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish,

338
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:43,927
French, a little Swahili
and a smattering of Hindi.

339
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:46,805
- It's part of my premed background.
- Bullshit.

340
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:49,057
Would you believe
a Russian grandmother?

341
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:51,810
That I believe.

342
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,648
- What's this?
- Personal effects, Doc. Can you read that?

343
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,652
Deceased.

344
00:29:00,653 --> 00:29:05,032
What's all this?

345
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:05,645
Deceased.

346
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:10,858
Deceased.

347
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:19,087
Deceased. All of them.

348
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,798
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up.
- Right.

349
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,799
DeJesus, dump this last box.

350
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:31,808
That's nice.
What is this? Vodka.

351
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,811
Stresnavga.
Hey, that's good stuff.

352
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:37,022
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

353
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,566
Hey, Becky, if I'm on report,
I guess this bottle's mine, huh?

354
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:41,818
Well, I guess you're right.
It is yours.

355
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,989
But it's pilferage, so now you're down
for two counts of safety negligence

356
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,825
for risking Williams's life,
going on that boat and possessing

357
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,577
restricted material.

358
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:55,578
- Mr. Cobb, all this gets impounded.
- It's done.

359
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:59,169
And one more thing.

360
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,090
I think if I hear you call me
"Becky" one more time, Sixpack,

361
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:08,091
I'm gonna pop your tops...
all six of 'em.

362
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:21,692
(Speaking in Russian)

363
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:25,445
My infirmary's filled.

364
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:28,240
The doctors on board tell me
it's like a tropical infection.

365
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,993
(Speaking in Russian)

366
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:35,414
But it's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

367
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,625
And there's something else
I don't understand.

368
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:41,003
And then it goes off.

369
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:45,007
OK. So what do you want me to say, Doc?
It all sounds mysterious?

370
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,134
Yea.

371
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:49,845
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

372
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:52,431
Why are there two ships with
the same name in different places?

373
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:55,767
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian.
Maybe you read it wrong.

374
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:59,438
I didn't. Even if I had, there
should be a record of some ship that's

375
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:04,439
sunk within 100 miles of here,
and there's not.

376
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:15,867
And look at this tear.
This hole in the hull.

377
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:20,913
That's the result of an explosion.
I think that was a torpedo hit.

378
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:24,129
I think that ship
was sunk on purpose.

379
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,966
Hey Doc, now how the hell
do you know that's a torpedo hit?

380
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,344
I mean, a collision with another boat
could produce that hole.

381
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:32,137
I don't agree with you.

382
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:34,181
- This hole would not be so jagged...
- So what?

383
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:36,683
I mean, so what if they
scuttle their own boat?

384
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:39,436
I can't get bent outta shape
just because some people

385
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:43,273
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

386
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:48,274
I know about rocks. I know about stones,
Doc. I don't know about Russian boats.

387
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:51,823
Plus which, I bet you five dollars
it's a clerical error.

388
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:55,619
Hell, we sounded the horn on it.
Let the maritime people figure it out.

389
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,497
I gotta fix the lift lock.

390
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:01,500
Okay, two more days.

391
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:03,752
Let's have no waves.

392
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:07,589
Weather system on line.
Tracking meteorological patterns.

393
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,051
- Beginning scan.
- I hate...

394
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:13,428
waves.

395
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,222
Hey, Cobb.

396
00:32:15,223 --> 00:32:18,558
You know that in Switzerland,
they speak four major languages?

397
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,603
- Ask me if I care.
- I do.

398
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:24,272
When I get outta here,
I'm goin' there.

399
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:26,942
I'm gonna find a nice
snow-covered chalet...

400
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:31,943
warm little woman,
crackling fire, and ski.

401
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:37,160
Hey, Cobb, if you're
gonna be doing that, man,

402
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:39,162
you should be wearing
what you wear to the beach.

403
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:40,664
I hate the beach.

404
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:43,667
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

405
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:47,712
- I don't believe it. You got 'em.
- Yeah, put it there.

406
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:50,090
What are you doing
with Beck's personnel records?

407
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:51,675
Watch. You'll see.

408
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:55,720
Four, zero, five, four

409
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,305
eight, six.

410
00:32:57,306 --> 00:33:00,684
You guys are so full of shit.
I mean, how stupid do you think he is?

411
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:05,685
Who's gonna use
their social security number?

412
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,525
Bingo!

413
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:09,985
That bottle's mine.

414
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:13,530
- Cute, DeJesus. Specimen cups?
- Hey, loosen up, Bow.

415
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:16,867
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you.
- Not for me, thanks.

416
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,119
All you do is exercise.
Come on, you gotta live a little.

417
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,079
My astronaut training
starts in two days.

418
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,373
Forget space cadet.
I'll drink hers.

419
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:26,877
What happens if he goes back
and finds the bottle missing?

420
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:29,713
He won't.
I put the vodka in here.

421
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,007
Smart lad.

422
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:32,508
Cheers.

423
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:39,014
- It's water.
- Beck switched it.

424
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:41,016
That son of a gun
doesn't trust us.

425
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,643
That pretty-boy little turd.
I'm gonna fix his ass.

426
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:46,021
- There goes our party.
- It's not bad.

427
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:51,022
- It's not bad at all.
- It's water.

428
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:08,502
Hi!

429
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:13,503
Did I tell you
vodka's my favorite drink?

430
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,000
(Groaning and creaking)

431
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:52,420
Whoa.

432
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:54,506
That was a pretty big one, huh?

433
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,883
- You'd think we'd get used to it by now.
- Yeah.

434
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:01,884
You're wasting your time here.
This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

435
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:08,641
Yeah, I need an overhaul.
How's the training goin'?

436
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:12,732
It's going well.

437
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:15,277
I think I've got a good shot.

438
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,029
I just wish everyone would
stop giving me a hard time.

439
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,700
Yeah, I know what you mean.

440
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:26,701
Why don't you give me a hand
and hit that button, huh?

441
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,457
- Push D.L.
- What?

442
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:29,958
D.L.

443
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:38,177
Oh, man.

444
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:45,390
What are you doing down here?

445
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,268
Well, I'm trying to fix
this short in the lift lock.

446
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,562
What are you doing down here, Williams?

447
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,897
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

448
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:56,234
- You don't belong in a mine.
- You got that right.

449
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:58,278
But somebody just got
the brilliant idea

450
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:01,072
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys.

451
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:03,366
I think maybe they thought that
just 'cause I could tell

452
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:05,368
shit from silver,
I'd know how to run this place.

453
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,788
Well, do you?

454
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:11,708
You tell me.

455
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:13,752
I think you handled
DeJesus pretty well.

456
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,421
Yeah?

457
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:20,675
Well, that was luck.
I was scared to death.

458
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:24,054
What about Sixpack?

459
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:27,057
What about him?

460
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:31,144
Did you bust him because of me?

461
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:34,356
Maybe.

462
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:39,357
Well, I appreciate that.
But I'm okay.

463
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:45,655
Yeah, I know.

464
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:46,451
Good.

465
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:57,708
Oh, by the way, how did you know
they'd get into the vodka?

466
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:04,010
Hell, that's what I would've done.

467
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:09,011
Maybe you're more one
of us than you think.

468
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,991
Good morning.

469
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,618
Sorry.

470
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,619
Okay. That's good.

471
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,459
Just look at my forehead.

472
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,460
That's it.

473
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:48,467
Let me see your tongue.

474
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,766
Good morning, gentlemen.
What's wrong, Doc?

475
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:56,646
I'm getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover.

476
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:58,940
- Take off your shirt.
- Lt ain't no hangover.

477
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:03,941
Feels about 1000 times worse.

478
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:08,825
How long did you have these spots?

479
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:13,826
- What?
- Don't touch it.

480
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:22,964
Well, as First Officer of the shack,
it's your call.

481
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:26,342
But if I were you,
I'd not be too hasty.

482
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,886
I don't get it.

483
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:32,849
Any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup

484
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,436
won't look good on
an otherwise excellent record.

485
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:41,437
But like I said, it's your call.

486
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:49,073
Well, <i>as</i> bad as he is,
there's no way

487
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:52,160
we're gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there.

488
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:55,371
- He's tankin' on us.
- No, I don't think so.

489
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:58,458
I heard him last night,
and he didn't sound so good.

490
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,711
The company will take that under
consideration when they look at our numbers.

491
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:05,548
Sweetheart, the company
doesn't give a damn about why.

492
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,592
The contract says,
if we miss our quota

493
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:10,220
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month.

494
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,222
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

495
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:14,933
The bastard's
definitely tanking on us.

496
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,644
- Yep, I think you're right.
- I wish you were, but he's not.

497
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,646
He's really sick.
He ain't comin' out today.

498
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,689
- Williams, take her down.
- That's terrific.

499
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,360
- Three months of work down the tubes.
- You're outta here, guys.

500
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,738
So, what, are you taking inventory?

501
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:33,739
No, Mr. Jones.
I'm getting ready to play Ping-Pong.

502
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:37,288
I'm goin' to work, Mr. Jones.
You got a problem with that?

503
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:42,289
- Work?
- Work.

504
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:55,056
- Try to hold as steady as you can.
- What the hell is it, Doc?

505
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:57,642
- I'm taking a little skin sample.
- Come on. Give me something.

506
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,727
Just a second.
Steady as you can.

507
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:03,231
Try to do it as quick as I can.
That's it. I got it.

508
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:08,232
Steady, steady, steady.
Easy, easy.

509
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:12,448
It's all right.
Keep your hands off it.

510
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,661
Here. Hold that.

511
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:21,662
I'm gonna take a look at this
under the microscope.

512
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,659
Container 22 is full, sir.

513
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,287
Okay, this one's full up, so let's run her
outta here and bring in a new one.

514
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:04,288
You got it.

515
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,557
"An organism of unknown origin."
No kidding.

516
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:24,558
Tell me something I don't know.

517
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:34,568
Goddamn it, take a guess.

518
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:39,637
Good work out there, Becky.
I mean, Mr. Beck.

519
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:42,640
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

520
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:45,601
No harm done.

521
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:48,438
Just don't call me cracker.

522
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:50,690
Perk up, sport.

523
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:55,691
How can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours?

524
00:42:56,697 --> 00:42:59,991
Put this on.
I want you to examine him.

525
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:04,992
- I'm not a doctor.
- For this, you don't need to be.

526
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:35,068
Oh, Lord.

527
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,487
Am I wearing this 'cause
you think it might be contagious?

528
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:39,489
I don't know if it is,
I don't know if it isn't.

529
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,325
I don't know a damn thing.
Neither does anyone else.

530
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:45,244
I've been going back and forth
with Narragansett Naval all day.

531
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:47,205
Consulting with the best people
in marine medicine...

532
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:49,207
the best people in virology.

533
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,667
They don't even believe
the symptoms I'm describing.

534
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:54,337
Their best guess, and that's
all it is is just a guess...

535
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,798
is that before Sixpack died,
he was undergoing

536
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,800
some form of genetic alteration.

537
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:01,052
Genetic alteration from what?

538
00:44:01,053 --> 00:44:03,054
It could be a million things.

539
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:06,015
Something in the food, the air.

540
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:11,016
Sixpack went in that ship,
and so did Williams.

541
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:13,231
I want to examine
the rest of the crew.

542
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:16,234
But I don't want to create a panic,
so until I get some answers

543
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:21,235
I don't think we should tell them
that Sixpack is dead.

544
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:26,202
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles?
What is it?

545
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:29,038
It's a little difficult
to describe.

546
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,498
Christ, it would be
a hell of a thing

547
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,875
if I went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing.

548
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:37,130
My wife would never
understand that at all.

549
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:39,173
I don't think we have
to worry about that, do we?

550
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:41,175
She wouldn't understand that at all.

551
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:43,594
She'd think I was down here
screwing my head off or something.

552
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:46,222
Put on your shirt.

553
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:51,223
- It's all right?
- Yeah, you're fine.

554
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:54,689
This whole thing is unnecessary, Doc.

555
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,690
The only skin problem
I can see is white people.

556
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:03,072
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

557
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:05,449
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

558
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,911
- Anything wrong?
- No, I just wanted to see something.

559
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:11,205
That's all.

560
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:15,126
You think it has anything to do
with going on that ship?

561
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:17,295
Well, it's a possibility.
But if that was the case

562
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:19,589
you'd be showing some symptoms,
wouldn't you?

563
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,800
- I'm okay?
- You're fine.

564
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,802
No, really, you're fine.

565
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:27,763
Great. Thanks, Doc.

566
00:45:27,764 --> 00:45:30,516
What do you mean, a skin problem?

567
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:32,685
Your skin changes?

568
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:37,686
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly.
- What, like a fish?

569
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,320
- Yeah, like a fish.
- I was justjoking, Doc.

570
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:53,911
You can finish getting dressed now.

571
00:45:54,374 --> 00:45:59,374
Oh, Bowman. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

572
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:08,346
- Generic alteration?
- Genetic.

573
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:11,849
Whatever. But you think it's
restricted to this one crew member?

574
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,851
- Well, so far, but...
- But what?

575
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,853
What if it turns out
to be nothing?

576
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:18,064
What are you talking about?
It's already killed one man!

577
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:22,818
But you have no proof that
this disease is contagious, do you?

578
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:27,819
And we've been wrong before,
haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

579
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:30,826
Look, Martin, I think
you're missing the point here.

580
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:33,329
My crew's in jeopardy.
I've seen this disease.

581
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,331
And it's no day at the beach.

582
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:38,125
So by way of paragraph 539
of the manual

583
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:41,170
I'm ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation

584
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:43,214
of all the personnel
on the shack.

585
00:46:43,215 --> 00:46:45,341
It's your call,
but Unfortunately

586
00:46:45,342 --> 00:46:48,052
we can't pick you up so soon.

587
00:46:48,053 --> 00:46:51,430
There's a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of Cuba

588
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:53,432
possibly coming your way.

589
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:56,894
And if it does, the company does not
want to risk losing you folks.

590
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:57,895
What are you saying?

591
00:46:57,896 --> 00:46:59,981
Are you saying you're not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time?

592
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:02,024
It shouldn't be a long delay.

593
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:04,527
Well, What's a long delay?
A day? A week? What?

594
00:47:04,528 --> 00:47:08,072
Twelve hours. We should know something
first thing in the morning.

595
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:11,617
- I'll keep you posted.
- You better be there.

596
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,577
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours.

597
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:18,578
I promise.

598
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:32,555
Bow. Bow, are you okay?

599
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:36,642
Oh, my God. Come on.

600
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:41,643
Can you help us here?

601
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:47,858
- Let's put her here.
- Come on. Take it easy.

602
00:47:48,947 --> 00:47:53,534
It's all right.

603
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:57,204
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna go find Doc, all right?

604
00:47:57,205 --> 00:48:02,205
Hey, Doc?
Maybe he's with Sixpack.

605
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,505
Doc? Hey, you in here?

606
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:09,550
Sixpack?

607
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:11,969
Hey, man, how you doin'?

608
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,849
We made quota today, man, no thanks
to you, you dog, but we made it.

609
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,769
You won't believe this, man,
but Beck helped us out.

610
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,813
Yeah, we just brought Bowman in, man.

611
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:24,815
She don't look too good.

612
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:29,195
You know, I hope
what you got ain't catchin'.

613
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,572
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

614
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:34,617
You go on back to sleep, okay?

615
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:39,618
I'll talk to you later, all right?

616
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:48,464
- I'm gonna go check the control room.
- Okay.

617
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:51,592
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Willie, please don't go!

618
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:55,137
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

619
00:48:55,138 --> 00:49:00,138
Shh. You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

620
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,004
(Crying)

621
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:48,315
Sixpack...

622
00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:48,860
Sixpack?

623
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:57,946
My hair's coming out.

624
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:16,635
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

625
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:18,637
Yeah.

626
00:50:18,638 --> 00:50:19,138
Bowman?

627
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:28,393
I don't understand.
We just left her here.

628
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:41,990
Bowman? Bowman, it's Doc!

629
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:54,551
Oh, man.

630
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:36,461
Other than that, there's not much more
that I can tell you about it...

631
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:40,761
except that none of you have
any of the symptoms.

632
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:44,139
And this disease, it killed Bow?

633
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,433
No.

634
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:51,188
No, she killed herself.

635
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:53,649
Hey, we're getting outta
here just in time.

636
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,943
Yeah, well, that's a
whole 'nother problem.

637
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:59,780
We're on hold for the pickup. There's
a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

638
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:03,075
- A hurricane?
- Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

639
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:08,076
Twelve hours? What're we gonna do?
We can't stay here for 12...

640
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,710
- What was that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

641
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:17,711
Okay? Doc.

642
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:36,400
Oh, my God.

643
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,402
What is this?

644
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:43,403
What's goin' on, Doc?

645
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:14,017
- Okay, Willie, get the door.
- Got it.

646
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,523
Beck.

647
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:19,943
The contract states that you can't
dispose of a body without authorization.

648
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:22,780
Come on. Will you for once
forget about the contract?

649
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:27,781
Section C of the Health and Safety Code.
Watch it.

650
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:31,246
Willie, program that lift lock.

651
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:34,249
Hey, I feel something.

652
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,251
What are you talkin' about?
They're dead.

653
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:39,046
Wait a minute.
I feel something too.

654
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,173
- Let's go.
- Somebody's alive in here.

655
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:42,341
Come on. Come on. Come on.

656
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:43,550
Alright, come on,
let's flush it, Doc.

657
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,719
What do you mean "Flush it?"
They're human beings we're talking about

658
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,221
- for God's sake!
- What if one's alive?

659
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:49,014
- How about a moment of silence?
- Let's do it, Doc.

660
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:50,808
My God, they're alive!

661
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:55,809
- Get it up here.
- Let's have a look.

662
00:53:56,189 --> 00:53:57,439
Bow.

663
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,358
- Don't stop!
- What the hell was that?

664
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,486
Hit the button!

665
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:04,655
- Hit the lift button!
- Get outta there!

666
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:08,033
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

667
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:09,868
Beck!

668
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:10,413
Come on!

669
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:46,468
Oh, God!

670
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:57,017
It's coming up now. That camera's gonna
move into this room. That's it.

671
00:55:57,018 --> 00:56:02,018
Some kind of sick bay or lab
or something. Hold it. Run it back.

672
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:06,944
That's it. Stop. Now move in.

673
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:10,531
See? It looks like a human skull,
but I don't know.

674
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:15,532
- There's something about it. It's...
- Bigger.

675
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:26,755
Well, somebody's been screwing around.
Just take a look at that hand.

676
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:31,718
- Look at the size of it.
- If you were tampering with genetics...

677
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:34,471
why stop with the base model?

678
00:56:34,472 --> 00:56:37,766
Why not try to alter the human form?

679
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:42,312
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live
underwater. Think of the possibilities.

680
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:44,314
Regeneration.

681
00:56:44,315 --> 00:56:47,901
The ability to withstand
extreme cold, pressure.

682
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:50,988
Just think of it.
Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

683
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:53,991
<i>So</i> What's next? I mean, what if
we run outta airplanes one day?

684
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:57,786
What are we gonna do?
Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

685
00:56:57,787 --> 00:57:02,787
<i>Natura no confundendo est.</i>

686
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:07,876
Loosely translated:
"Don't fuck with Mother Nature."

687
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:28,859
I better let the company know.

688
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,571
Have you ever thought
that they may suspect already?

689
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:34,656
Yeah. I thought about that, Doc.

690
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,701
But I also like to think they got some
kind of commitment to their people.

691
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:40,120
You can save that speech
for your ad campaign.

692
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:43,290
This company's commitment is
to the almighty dollar.

693
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:47,085
If you think, based on what
we've told them, that Tri-Oceanic

694
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:50,839
is gonna risk exposing themself to
potential market loss just to save us

695
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,342
you're in for an
eye-opening experience.

696
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:56,303
Maybe.

697
00:57:56,304 --> 00:58:00,057
Maybe so. And I know your life's
gone a couple of bad rounds, Doc.

698
00:58:00,058 --> 00:58:05,058
But it doesn't necessarily mean
this whole company's one big bummer.

699
00:58:26,709 --> 00:58:31,709
I think we got something here.

700
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:36,839
Son of a bitch.

701
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:40,973
I don't get it.
Why did they put it in the vodka?

702
00:58:40,974 --> 00:58:42,474
It was an experiment, man.

703
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:45,519
I mean, they put the drug or
whatever it was in the vodka!

704
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,521
They meant to trick
them into takin' it.

705
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:50,399
That way, see, they didn't know
what they were drinkin'.

706
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,944
I <i>mean,</i> with us, they would have
put it in the coffee.

707
00:58:53,945 --> 00:58:56,363
- What are you talkin' about?
- Come on, man.

708
00:58:56,364 --> 00:59:00,367
You know how mothers put the
castor oil in with orange juice?

709
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:03,412
They trick the baby into drinkin' it
so he don't know what he's drinkin.

710
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:06,873
That's the kind of shit
they was doin', man!

711
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:08,917
Fool. He could've got us all killed.

712
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:11,837
You guys weren't <i>so</i> holy when
you were shooting that vodka.

713
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:13,005
It could've been anyone.

714
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:16,216
Well, Miss High and Mighty,
it doesn't seem to bother you none.

715
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,301
Yeah, it bothers me.

716
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:20,971
You deal with it your way.
I'll deal with it mine.

717
00:59:20,972 --> 00:59:25,475
You know that in Gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes?

718
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:30,022
Sixty-four square miles.

719
00:59:30,023 --> 00:59:34,151
How can you sit there goin', "Shh, shh,"
after what we just went through?

720
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:37,529
And another thing, man. I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' about your goddamn skiin' OK?

721
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,742
You don't know shit about skiin', man.
They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

722
00:59:41,743 --> 00:59:43,744
What about what we just saw?

723
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:47,956
Like Willie <i>said,</i> you deal with it
your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

724
00:59:47,957 --> 00:59:52,957
- Doesn't anybody care what just happened?
- What're you gonna do about it? Huh?

725
00:59:53,254 --> 00:59:58,254
Sixpack and Bow are dead.

726
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:05,219
I can't help what happened. Can you?

727
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:09,728
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
Anybody want anything?

728
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:14,729
Eat? After what we just went through?

729
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:34,544
The storm's still holding its course.

730
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:38,256
What about that disease?
Still just the one crew member?

731
01:00:38,257 --> 01:00:43,257
No change. Still just the one.

732
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:12,833
Hey, man, everybody's jumpy.
What are you doin'?

733
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:14,835
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

734
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:19,548
Look, Hazy, you gonna make me finish
this puzzle by myself, or what?

735
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:22,759
I should.
You know how long that took me?

736
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

737
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:33,432
- I'll be right there.
- Okay. Hurry up.

738
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:51,538
(Hissing)

739
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:56,539
(Screaming)

740
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:12,555
(Screaming)

741
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:18,899
Holy shit!

742
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,900
Please, God, help me!
Help me, Jonesy! Help me.

743
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:27,782
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll be right back, okay?

744
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:32,783
Don't leave me.
Jonesy, don't leave me!

745
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:37,830
- Please.
- I'll be back.

746
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:44,674
Look! It's got Hazy!
Stay here and watch the door!

747
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:49,675
Don't let him out!
I'm gonna go get the doc.

748
01:02:59,023 --> 01:03:01,066
I didn't want to tell her about Bowman.

749
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:03,610
I listened to Martin, and all my mind says
"She's full of shit."

750
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:08,611
It's got DeJesus! Come on!

751
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,103
Beck, don't go in there.
Don't touch anything!

752
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:39,938
DeJesus! Cobb!

753
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:42,565
What the hell you doin'?
You supposed to be watchin' the door!

754
01:03:42,566 --> 01:03:44,693
I'm not gonna watch that
thing without some protection.

755
01:03:44,694 --> 01:03:47,028
- That thing is my friend.
- Your friend is not human!

756
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:49,614
Shut up, both of you! Jones!
Let's go find him.

757
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:54,536
Okay? Come on. Let's go find him.
Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

758
01:03:54,537 --> 01:03:57,622
What's happening?

759
01:03:57,623 --> 01:03:59,874
My God, she's out there.

760
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,876
All right, look. Jones, you come with me.

761
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:06,877
Doc, you and Cobb check your office
and the dorm. Let's go.

762
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:33,784
Willie?

763
01:04:42,543 --> 01:04:45,795
Hey, Beck.

764
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:47,797
Oh, no. It's her scarf.

765
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:51,009
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

766
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:54,554
- What the hell you doin'?
- I've been trying to fix these lights.

767
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:55,638
What's going on?

768
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:58,350
Whatever got Sixpack
and Bowman is still here.

769
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:03,351
- What?
- Lt just got DeJesus.

770
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:30,840
All right. We're talkin' turkey.

771
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:34,511
DeJesus! Hey!

772
01:05:34,512 --> 01:05:37,555
Doc.

773
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:42,556
Oh, my God.

774
01:05:44,605 --> 01:05:47,816
The blood supply.

775
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:50,318
Oh, my God.

776
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:55,319
It got the blood supply.

777
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:19,677
(Screaming)

778
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:46,416
It's growing. It's had a meal.

779
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:49,043
- It needs blood?
- Apparently.

780
01:06:49,044 --> 01:06:53,047
This is great. You're tellin' me we got
a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

781
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:56,134
That's why that one on the ship
was dead. It needed blood.

782
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:57,260
What one on that ship?

783
01:06:57,261 --> 01:07:00,638
Somebody want to let the
rank-and-file in on your little secret?

784
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,266
Whatever it is,
it appears to be a genetic aberration.

785
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:06,978
- No shit.
- What're you trying to tell us, Doc?

786
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:11,979
It has all the characteristics of
deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

787
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:17,947
regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

788
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:20,950
But the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored

789
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:24,704
seems to imply that is has
some other quality.

790
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:27,832
- What?
- Lt absorbs the intelligence of its victim.

791
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,251
Intelligence may not be the right word.

792
01:07:30,252 --> 01:07:31,920
The hell with semantics, Doc.
What are you saying, now?

793
01:07:31,921 --> 01:07:35,131
This thing is part DeJesus,
part Sixpack, part Bowman, what?

794
01:07:35,132 --> 01:07:38,968
I don't know.
I'd just be guessing.

795
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:41,179
But I do know this:

796
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:46,180
The Russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves.

797
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:48,978
Maybe to protect us all.

798
01:07:48,979 --> 01:07:51,314
Alright. Then I say we protect ourselves.

799
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:53,858
Let's escape into those air bubbles
and get the hell out of here.

800
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:55,777
And hit the surface in
the middle of a hurricane?

801
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:57,278
Man, that storm'd rip
those bubbles to pieces.

802
01:07:57,279 --> 01:08:02,279
- They'd never find us.
- We wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell.

803
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:07,205
- So what are we gonna do?
- Look, I think we got one shot.

804
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:11,709
Just one shot. We lure it down into the
swamp, flush it out just like the other.

805
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,710
And how're we gonna do that?

806
01:08:21,178 --> 01:08:24,013
So we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes.

807
01:08:24,014 --> 01:08:27,225
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

808
01:08:27,226 --> 01:08:28,977
- Mark. Got it?
- Got it.

809
01:08:28,978 --> 01:08:31,479
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

810
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,816
If Jones and I aren't back here
in 30 minutes in the mess,

811
01:08:34,817 --> 01:08:37,819
hurricane or nothin', you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass.

812
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,820
' Okay? ' Okay_.

813
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:41,531
- Let's do it.
- Be careful with this.

814
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:44,242
- Don't worry. I don't want to give up any more.
- Take care.

815
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:46,494
I'll do my best.

816
01:08:46,495 --> 01:08:51,495
Okay, let's go.

817
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:39,589
You know, I was quite good once.

818
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:44,590
When I did something,
it was important, you know?

819
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:50,266
I developed drugs and techniques

820
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:55,267
that're used every day by
doctors all over the world.

821
01:09:55,606 --> 01:10:00,606
- Made a difference.
- Lt still does, Doc.

822
01:10:02,821 --> 01:10:07,821
This itches like hell.

823
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:11,579
- I'm all right.
- Let me have a look.

824
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:16,580
It really itches.

825
01:10:16,835 --> 01:10:20,129
That's because it's healing.

826
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,548
I'm gonna change that dressing,
see if I can't make you more comfortable.

827
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:25,134
- Where are you going, Doc?
- The infirmary.

828
01:10:25,135 --> 01:10:26,678
Without protection?

829
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:31,679
- You shouldn't go out there.
- She's right, you know.

830
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:23,290
(Muffled booming)

831
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:27,757
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

832
01:12:27,758 --> 01:12:32,758
Here we go.

833
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:59,747
- Take off your shirt, Cobb.
- Sure.

834
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:03,668
I'm cold.

835
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:05,920
Help me, please.

836
01:13:05,921 --> 01:13:10,921
Oh, yeah, sure.

837
01:13:16,306 --> 01:13:18,349
<i>Doc? Doc!</i>

838
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,935
Help me!

839
01:13:20,936 --> 01:13:22,645
What's happening?

840
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:23,146
Help!

841
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:29,735
Doc.

842
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:34,736
(Screaming)

843
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:42,456
- Beck! Jones!
- Willie!

844
01:13:42,457 --> 01:13:43,069
(Roaring)

845
01:13:47,629 --> 01:13:50,214
- Willie! Run!
- Run!

846
01:13:50,215 --> 01:13:52,258
Get over here!

847
01:13:52,259 --> 01:13:52,759
Willie!

848
01:14:08,442 --> 01:14:12,069
(Screaming)

849
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,281
How are you doin'? All right?
Where's Doc and Cobb?

850
01:14:15,282 --> 01:14:17,491
- It got Doc.
- Wait a minute. It was just here.

851
01:14:17,492 --> 01:14:20,453
- I know.
- Wait a second. You saw it?

852
01:14:20,454 --> 01:14:25,454
- It was in Cobb. It was in him.
- Slow down. There's two of them?

853
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,169
- Shit.
- All right.

854
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:30,796
- How are you doin'?
- Okay.

855
01:14:30,797 --> 01:14:33,382
<i>Okay, now what?</i>

856
01:14:33,383 --> 01:14:36,719
How do you feel about big waves?

857
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:41,720
I love waves.

858
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:17,009
We're trapped.
The escape bubbles are gone.

859
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,095
- Willie, the door.
- Hey, look at this.

860
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:21,138
"I am fully aware of the finality
of my decision."

861
01:15:21,139 --> 01:15:24,433
It is my hope that our sacrifice
will mean that the human race

862
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:26,477
"will never know this awful mutation."

863
01:15:26,478 --> 01:15:31,478
- Our death warrant.
- Signed by the good doctor.

864
01:15:41,827 --> 01:15:46,372
Hell with it.

865
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:48,582
- What are you doing?
- Well...

866
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:53,583
I'm gonna find out
just how far up Shit Creek we are.

867
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:06,350
- Thank goodness you're still alive.
- Where you been?

868
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:09,437
Hey man, you better get your ass
out here now and get us. Right now!

869
01:16:09,438 --> 01:16:12,606
Please, Mr. Jones, calm down.
We haven't deserted you.

870
01:16:12,607 --> 01:16:15,985
Naturally, after we received Dr.
Thompson's message, we were concerned.

871
01:16:15,986 --> 01:16:18,237
But we never would have deserted you.

872
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:19,905
When are you coming?

873
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:23,242
- You said 12 hours, remember?
- Well, that's the bad news.

874
01:16:23,243 --> 01:16:27,079
The hurricane has turned your way.
Right now, it's on a course of...

875
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,874
Just answer the goddamn question.
When are you coming?

876
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,127
- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours?

877
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:35,546
I realize you must have gone
through hell...

878
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:37,631
Gone? Bitch, we're still here!

879
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:40,676
I can't control the weather.
Now, rest assured your SOS

880
01:16:40,677 --> 01:16:43,512
was received by the
coast guard and the navy

881
01:16:43,513 --> 01:16:47,308
and we will be responding at
the earliest, safest opportunity.

882
01:16:47,309 --> 01:16:49,018
Just don't promise us nothin'.

883
01:16:49,019 --> 01:16:52,605
I realize this must sound ridiculous
after what you've been through.

884
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:55,733
- No shit.
- Now please try and get some rest.

885
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:58,861
How in the hell are we gonna get some rest?
I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

886
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:01,447
- Get some rest?
- Save your breath.

887
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:05,409
- Damn. In 48 hours? No way.
- We don't have much choice, do we?

888
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,871
I'll tell you what. I'll take a watch.
You all try to get some rest.

912
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:18,918
- They ripped open an air duct.
- Can we fix it?

913
01:19:18,919 --> 01:19:21,587
There are 20 miles of pipe in this building.
They could've tapped in anywhere.

914
01:19:21,588 --> 01:19:26,588
That's true.

915
01:19:27,135 --> 01:19:29,553
Cobb. Job security.

916
01:19:29,554 --> 01:19:32,139
It's that rattle that duct in Corridor A.

917
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:35,559
You got it. It's showin' us where it is.

918
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,729
- It's drawin' us out.
- Lt didn't waste any time, did it?

919
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,607
You can't go out there.
That's what it wants.

920
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:45,110
Yeah, well, if we lose enough air in here,
the internal pressure will drop, and crunch.

921
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:46,779
Implosion, babe.

922
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,324
Wait a minute. You don't
think I'm staying here?

923
01:19:50,325 --> 01:19:55,325
<i>Nine minutes to implosion.</i>

924
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:59,208
- It's over here!
- Ls that it?

925
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:03,045
Yeah.

926
01:20:03,046 --> 01:20:08,046
- It's going!
- We're losin' air faster than I thought.

927
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:11,929
- Go! Here.
- Don't spend all day down there.

928
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:14,223
Don't worry. I won't.

929
01:20:14,224 --> 01:20:19,224
Let's do it.

930

<i>Eight minutes to implosion.</i>

931
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:54,596
- Oh, no. Damn!
- Can we fix it?

932
01:20:54,597 --> 01:20:57,433
Can we block it off, maybe shut it
down someplace else? Think, man!

933
01:20:57,434 --> 01:20:58,225
Come on.

934
01:20:58,226 --> 01:21:01,020
- What do you think? I wanna die?
- We're not gonna die, man, we're gonna live.

935
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:02,354
Now think! What are we gonna do?

936
01:21:02,355 --> 01:21:04,356
- How should I know?
- You know this shack!

937
01:21:04,357 --> 01:21:07,318
- I don't know, I don't know!
- Come on! This shack's your home, man!

938
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:12,319
The swamp. There's a backup
air valve at the swamp. If we...

939
01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:14,325
Doc.

940
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:17,161
- What?
- I just saw Doc.

941
01:21:17,162 --> 01:21:19,705
No, Jones. Let's get outta here.

942

Willie! Willie!

946
01:21:40,935 --> 01:21:43,145
- Did you get it?
- I think we did it!

947
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:45,314
- I don't know!
- Hurry!

948

Move it! The door's closing!

01:21:56,910 --> 01:22:01,910
The other door's closing!

Willie, get out! Get out!

951

- Torch it!
- Careful!

952
01:22:07,253 --> 01:22:12,253
Jones! It's jammed!

953

- The suits? You crazy?

Willie, bring the lift bags!

- How're we gonna get to the surface?
- Like this.

977

We'll triple the inflation ratio.
We'll float to the top like a balloon. Go!
