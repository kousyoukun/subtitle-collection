1
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,570
Four to shack.
Container 14 ready to winch.

2
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:20,299
Six to shack.
Silver extraction completed.

3
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,780
Tha's good eating.
Burritos, enchiladas...

4
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:32,564
Black beans and rice, man.
That's Puerto Rican. I gotta take you...

5
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,793
I hate to break up
the great Latino gourmet debate...

6
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,676
but we ain't off the clock yet.

7
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:42,897
Since we got a few more days here,
can somebody...

8
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:45,780
please tell me who the hook is?

9
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,266
Fifteen, is that you?

10
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,242
You got a hook on box 22?

11
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:54,098
The man is asking you
if you're hooked on 22, dumb shit.

12
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,433
Watch your mouth, Sixpack.
Fifteen to shack.

13
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,540
This is Jones.
I ain't the hook.

14
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,466
Seven to shack. I'm the hook.

15
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,248
Okay there, seven.
Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

16
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:06,250
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit
or something? We're all waitin' on ya.

17
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:07,817
Go suck on a shrimp, Sixpack.

18
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,577
Seven to shack.
Ready to winch.

19
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,911
There we go.
Winch on.

20
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,312
Okay, miners, let's come on home.

21
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:29,133
You heard the man.
Let's get movin'.

22
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,306
Come on, guys.
We only have three days left.

23
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,231
I hear that.

24
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,266
Put the kettle on, Beck.
We're coming home.

25
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,633
Well, Doc,
not so as you'd notice...

26
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,068
but the sun has set
on yet another day...

27
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:12,330
of hard labor and toil
here at the homestead.

28
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,969
Sixteen tons
and what do you get

29
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:19,720
Another day older
and deeper in debt

30
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:22,243
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'cause I can't go

31
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:25,480
I owe my soul to the company store

32
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:37,222
Jonesy! Help!

33
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,568
Cobb!

34
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,522
My rebreather's stopped!
I'm losing compression!

35
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:42,921
I'm gonna blow my suit!
Doc! Beck!

36
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,604
Yeah, I got you, DeJesus.
You look fine from in here.

37
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:47,878
- Give me a readout.
- My rebreather's stopped!

38
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,531
I'm losing compression!
I can't breathe!

39
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:54,307
I can't get an accurate readout
if you panic.

40
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:57,541
Doc, we got an emergency here.
We need you. Got trouble.

41
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:03,044
So just breathe slowly
and through your nose...

42
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,185
and out through your mouth.

43
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:07,166
I think you're hyperventilating.

44
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,339
- Hyperventilating, my ass!
- How do you do this?

45
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:12,262
- He's gonna blow.
- No, he's not gonna blow!

46
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,678
Doc, come on!

47
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,051
- Check his oxygen level.
- Yeah, I'm doin' that.

48
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,836
- Do something, quick!
- I'm doin' it.

49
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,133
Help!

50
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:33,533
Damn!

51
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,540
Hook him to my RV-four transpac.

52
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,678
Right. Hook him to the RV...

53
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,499
No! Don't do that!
Don't circumventilate him.

54
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,183
I think you're risking
an implosion probability.

55
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:47,970
Doc, we need you.
Bring him into the shack.

56
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,939
- There's not enough time!
- You've got time. Just do it.

57
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,474
I'm gonna die!

58
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:54,752
You ain't gonna die.

59
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,129
Just keep him moving.

60
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:09,152
Take it easy. We'll make it.

61
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,551
Open the damn door.

62
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:20,408
Come on! Get him inside!

63
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:31,166
Keep him moving.

64
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,263
Come on, lift lock. Go.

65
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,278
Come on, lift lock. Up.

66
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:47,379
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that
doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

67
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,305
It ain't the goddamn suit, man.
It's Beck.

68
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,665
It's not his fault.
Doc shoulïve been there.

69
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,802
If he was a real shack boss,
Doc would have been there.

70
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,434
He got real lucky.

71
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:59,801
Hey, Wall Street broke
the 15,000-point barrier today.

72
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,639
Shit. There goes my bonus.

73
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:07,024
You know, I stood next to a guy
who blew a suit once.

74
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,714
He was in the Indian Ocean.

75
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,119
- That is not a pretty sight.
- Leave Hazy alone, man.

76
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,696
One tiny little hole
in the fucking toe of his suit.

77
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,004
No bigger than your dick.

78
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:20,308
Yeah, that ocean came in.

79
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,269
The pressure just crammed
his whole body up into his helmet.

80
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:26,198
We just buried his helmet.

81
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:32,148
- That woulïve been you, DeJesus.
- Hey, I know about implosion.

82
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:35,597
Yeah, I bet you do.
I bet you was imploding in your pants.

83
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,669
- Knock it off, Sixpack!
- Cut it out, you guys.

84
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:41,644
We've been stuck down in this hole
for a hell of a long time.

85
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:45,427
We had a close call. We're not gonna
let something like this break us apart.

86
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:48,242
The doc is my responsibility.

87
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:55,251
Bullshit.

88
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:13,775
It would be just my luck to finish two
months' worth of work two miles under...

89
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,079
and have the whole place fall apart
with just three days left.

90
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,001
Anyone check weather up top?

91
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,783
It's raining, but it's
supposed to be clear for pickup.

92
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,737
As long as there's no waves.
I hate waves.

93
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:26,828
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd
be doin' if you were up top right now?

94
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,807
Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy.

95
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:32,459
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic?
- Wherever I can find it.

96
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,384
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

97
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,132
Be watching news on TV that's so bad,
it makes you nauseous.

98
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,299
So bad that you get in your car
to get some fresh air...

99
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:42,441
and after five minutes,
you realize...

100
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:45,511
the air's so dirty,
you can't breathe.

101
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:49,129
If you're lucky enough
to get back to your house...

102
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,720
that looks the same
as everybody else's...

103
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,791
you find that your wife
is as fat as she ever was.

104
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,968
And the only reason your kids
aren't strung out on the drugs...

105
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,941
they were using is because
they've found some new drugs...

106
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:03,178
which screw 'em up even more,
and that's just the good part.

107
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,385
You people don't appreciate
how good you've got it down here.

108
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,856
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb.
- That's all right. I was just finished.

109
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:14,187
- How are you feeling there?
- I'm okay.

110
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,620
- See the doc yet?
- No.

111
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,019
Well, you better let the doc
take a look at you after dinner.

112
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,452
- Since he was busy earlier.
- When we needed him.

113
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,818
Why don't you let me
handle the doc.

114
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,219
Makes me feel better already.

115
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,984
I was looking at the shack
maintenance hours outstanding.

116
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:33,288
I see where this is going.

117
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:37,828
All of us owe some shack maintenance
time. Tonight would be a good time.

118
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,616
No way, Mr. Beck.
No bleepin' way.

119
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:43,781
You can't call shack duty
on top of a full shift.

120
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,705
That's a union violation.
It's in the contract.

121
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,119
Right on, Cobb.
Let's hear it for the shop steward.

122
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:52,009
Hear that, Becky? The company's
got to abide by the rules.

123
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:55,140
I know about the contract.
You can follow the letter...

124
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,599
of the contract to the law and spend
an extra workday gettin' it done...

125
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:00,062
or you can get it done tonight
and call tomorrow a down day.

126
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,137
- What, are you giving us the day off?
- Looks that way.

127
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,183
What about our quota?

128
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,006
You're only 25 tons off quota.

129
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:10,439
You're bound to go way over that
by the last day.

130
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,985
Look, folks, it's just a day off.
It don't make no difference to me.

131
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:16,444
It's just up to you.
I thought it might be good.

132
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,659
- Hell, I could use a day off.
- Me too.

133
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:22,950
- What the hell.
- Okay, shop stewarïs three.

134
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,822
- Four.
- Four. Anybody else?

135
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,992
- Six.
- All right, here's what we got.

136
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,020
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle
in the air duct somewhere.

137
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,949
- Take a look at that.
- Okay.

138
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:37,916
Williams, run a diagnostic
on DeJesus's suit.

139
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,957
- Anybody else got any suit problems?
- Yeah, my pocket.

140
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,997
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

141
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:49,793
Good evening. Name's Thompson.
Party of one.

142
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:53,090
My reservation was 8:15.
Not too near the orchestra, please.

143
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:55,044
Are you gonna come
to work tomorrow, Doc?

144
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,963
No, I'll be on the golf course
in the morning.

145
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:59,003
Then, if I don't have
any babies to deliver...

146
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:01,377
I could stop by after lunch.

147
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:04,706
We almost had an accident today.
DeJesus's suit.

148
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:07,618
You have something
to say to me?

149
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,887
Yeah. Section 1412...

150
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,344
of the Tri-Oceanic manual requires...

151
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,128
a mining shack's medical officer
to be present in the control room...

152
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,366
during all exterior operations.

153
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,954
I just wanna make real damn sure
that's clear.

154
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,730
I'll keep it to nine holes
in the morning.

155
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:35,421
Thank you, sir, for taking care
of that situation.

156
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:22,006
- Listen to it, for Christ's sake.
- It's just gettin' old, that's all.

157
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:26,387
You don't see Doc opening me up
every time my joints start to creak.

158
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:29,494
As long as it's recycling
the air, let it be. Come on.

159
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,378
Ten to one it's a short.

160
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,345
Piece of cake.

161
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,841
Great.

162
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:22,771
Oh, mama! What a pair.

163
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,518
What'd you say?

164
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,684
I said, "What a pair."

165
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,363
Our shack boss and his washed-up
doctor buddy make quite a...

166
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,147
- What did you think I said?
- That you liked my boobs.

167
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,761
You watch the old Cobb magic,
all right?

168
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,316
Compliments of Bowman.

169
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,187
Yeah.

170
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:06,507
How in the hell did you do that?

171
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:09,743
You don't say anything to anybody.
Job security.

172
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:12,331
All right? Let's go.

173
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:15,567
Now, wait a minute, man.
How in the hell did you do that?

174
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,745
That's clean.

175
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:25,489
But there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, my God!

176
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,812
Come here, Kuki.

177
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,144
Sixpack, you shit!

178
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:41,872
Surprise!

179
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:45,384
How much silver are we gonna
start taking out of that mine again?

180
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:48,271
Well, Martin, I think you've got
an honest-to-God bonanza on your hands.

181
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:51,151
You can haul us out in a couple of days.
This mine will play itself.

182
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:53,637
When I told the Director
of Atlantic Operations...

183
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:57,901
that we had to stick a geologist
down there and turn that mine around...

184
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,644
I had no idea that you were going
to prove me a genius.

185
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:04,558
- Well, I'm glad you're happy.
- I'm ecstatic.

186
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:06,629
'Cause I can't wait
to get the fuck outta here.

187
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:08,076
What?

188
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:11,720
I said, I really can't wait
to get back to exploration diving.

189
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,644
I miss the research, and...

190
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,124
By the way, I ran that check
on Dr. Thompson.

191
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:19,946
He has a few incidences
of insubordination...

192
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:23,658
but his credentials
are very impressive.

193
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:26,823
Pharmacology.
He pioneered several vaccines.

194
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:28,932
Well, this ain't the Mayo Clinic.
How'd he get down here?

195
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:32,101
A serum he developed
killed several people.

196
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,271
An accident, but it got blown
all out of proportion.

197
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,681
Now, look.

198
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:39,081
Things are beginning to move
very fast now.

199
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:41,995
If you're having a problem with him
or you need any help...

200
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,164
just say the word.

201
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:48,744
No, I don't think
it's anything I can't handle.

202
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,055
Good.

203
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,401
How are your stocks doin'?
Haven't you made your million yet?

204
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:57,538
Not yet.

205
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:02,116
- How's Tri-Oceanic doing, Bow?
- Got money in this tub?

206
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:05,534
Yeah. I signed up
for the stock option.

207
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:07,976
Last year when they lost a tanker,
the bottom fell out of their stock.

208
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,983
I lost a bloody fortune.

209
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,911
You take your money too seriously.

210
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:30,949
You're damn right, I do.
I'm not down here for fun.

211
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:34,211
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

212
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,762
Look at those white legs!

213
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,026
Hey, Willie, I'm sorry
about that little incident tonight.

214
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:44,771
You know, I just thought
a little humor might loosen things up.

215
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,644
Hey, watch it!

216
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,336
No hard feelings?

217
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,023
Nope. Sweet dreams.

218
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,259
I got a date with an angel.

219
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:12,122
Come on, baby.

220
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:14,050
Sit on my face.

221
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:27,422
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

222
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,937
Look at my foot!
Look at my goddamn foot!

223
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,377
- I thought you'd find that funny.
- You think it's funny?

224
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,776
You're gonna think it's funny
when you eat this goddamn thing!

225
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,590
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Look at my foot!

226
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:41,242
This bitch put a goddamn
sea monster in my bunk!

227
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,614
- How do you know it was her?
- It was her!

228
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:46,528
- Are you calling me a liar?
- That may be the size of it, Bubba.

229
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:50,137
- You two just pulled sea duty tomorrow.
- Bullshit!

230
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,444
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

231
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,088
You just got half a day.
Any more hoopla, it's a full one.

232
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,046
Ready to drill.

233
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,061
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

234
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,981
- Let's blow it.
- Blow this.

235
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:14,940
Charge activated.

236
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,395
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

237
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:24,242
Oh, yeah!

238
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,042
It looks like the mother lode, guys.

239
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,898
I need more light on that, seven.

240
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:44,436
Sixpack, you hear that?
We need more light.

241
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,196
All right, look.

242
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:51,576
My cable's stuck.

243
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:03,448
Sixpack, What's happened?

244
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:06,164
We've lost him.

245
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:09,015
Well, what are you doing?
Having a party out there?

246
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:10,936
Beck, I'm looking for him.

247
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:20,179
Shack to seven.
What's going on out there?

248
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,822
He's gone.

249
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:27,702
Williams, speak to me.
What's happening out there?

250
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,852
Sixpack, answer.

251
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,577
Oh, my God!

252
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:40,309
Come on, Williams.
What's the alternate?

253
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:42,229
Try 35.

254
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:44,148
Williams? There she is.

255
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:50,100
Williams, you hear me?
What's going on out there?

256
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:52,020
He's gone over the South Ridge.

257
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:59,119
I'm going down after him.

258
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:01,709
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know
what the hell is over that ridge.

259
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,114
Come on, Jonesy, work it out.

260
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:09,131
- Sixpack's lost!
- Weren't they tied?

261
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,058
- I don't know!
- They're supposed to be tied.

262
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,490
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move it!

263
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:15,409
Oh, God!

264
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,785
What've we got?

265
00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:29,613
- Tube worms.
- How's she gonna get out?

266
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,440
Bowman, What's the self-contained
air capacity of that suit?

267
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,360
Thirty minutes.

268
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,454
This is six to shack.

269
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:56,362
For Goïs sakes, why doesn't
Sixpack have his blinkers on?

270
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,115
The man could be two feet away
and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

271
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:07,533
What?

272
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,453
What is this?

273
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,964
A ship?

274
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,290
That's Russian.

275
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,797
Are you picking this up?

276
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:52,998
Yeah, we got it. Can you open up
that picture a little for us?

277
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,185
Leviathan.

278
00:23:57,258 --> 00:24:00,324
- What?
- Leviathan.

279
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,249
- Bowman, run a check.
- Sir.

280
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:07,461
- Williams, What's your air reading?
- Twenty minutes.

281
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,082
We're gonna give you five,
then we're coming in.

282
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:12,007
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

283
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:23,047
I'm going inside.

284
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,939
Sixpack, answer me!

285
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:46,395
Baltic Sea?

286
00:24:56,773 --> 00:24:58,628
What have you got there, Bowman?

287
00:24:58,693 --> 00:25:02,206
The Leviathan. Currently with
the Russian Fleet in the Baltic Sea.

288
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:05,342
Currently horseshit. Currently it's
rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

289
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:08,227
Well, it's gotta be wrong.
Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

290
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,354
It's right here.
The Baltic Sea.

291
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:14,494
Maybe a ship sinks
and they don't notice it's missing.

292
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:19,100
Williams, you got one minute to find
Sixpack and get your butt out of there.

293
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:28,571
If Willie's got a minute,
how much time does Sixpack have?

294
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:02,814
The infirmary.

295
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:29,975
I'm rich, honey!

296
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:35,866
Safety negligence?
I never even heard a word.

297
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:38,485
How can I be on report?
Ain't that right, Cobby?

298
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,174
Don't Cobby me.
You're on your own this time.

299
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:43,098
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

300
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:46,711
A Timex. And it's still ticking.

301
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,942
A little Russian money.
It don't look like much.

302
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,727
Here's something for you, Bow.

303
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,465
Hey, Sixpack,
look at your girlfriends.

304
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,292
- What's that?
- "Kitty Does Kiev."

305
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,987
- Porn. Right up your alley.
- Let me see that.

306
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,813
It's in Russian.
I don't know what it says.

307
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:17,012
- May I see it, please?
- It's not really "Kitty Does Kiev."

308
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:23,249
- It's the captain's log on videotape.
- Don't tell me you read Russian.

309
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,319
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish...

310
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,813
French, a little Swahili
and a smattering of Hindi.

311
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:31,571
- It's part of my premed background.
- Bullshit.

312
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,744
Would you believe
a Russian grandmother?

313
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:36,367
That I believe.

314
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:40,082
- What's this?
- Personal effects. Can you read that?

315
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,485
Deceased.

316
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,805
What's all this?

317
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:50,700
Deceased.

318
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:00,852
Deceased. All of them.

319
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:05,131
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up.
- Right.

320
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:07,059
DeJesus, dump this last box.

321
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,736
That's nice.
What is this? Vodka.

322
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:17,618
Stresnavga.
Hey, that's good stuff.

323
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:19,723
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

324
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:22,161
If I'm on report,
I guess this bottle's mine, huh?

325
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:24,332
Well, I guess you're right.
It is yours.

326
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:28,330
But it's pilferage, so now you're down
for two counts of safety negligence...

327
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:31,020
for risking Williams's life,
going on that boat and possessing...

328
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,716
restricted material.

329
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,891
- All this gets impounded.
- It's done.

330
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,008
And one more thing.

331
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:44,750
I think if I hear you
call me "Becky" one more time...

332
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:48,078
I'm gonna pop your tops...
all six of 'em.

333
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:05,290
My infirmary's filled.

334
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:08,775
The doctors on board tell me
it's like a tropical infection.

335
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,119
But it's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

336
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:18,800
And there's something else
I don't understand.

337
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,260
And then it goes off.

338
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,873
So what do you want me to say?
It all sounds mysterious?

339
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:29,572
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

340
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,034
Why are there two ships with
the same name in different places?

341
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,240
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian.
Maybe you read it wrong.

342
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:38,308
I didn't. Even if I had, there
should be a record of some ship...

343
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,479
that's sunk within 100 miles of here,
and there's not.

344
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,617
And look at this tear.
This hole in the hull.

345
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:59,401
That's the result of an explosion.
I think that was a torpedo hit.

346
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,473
I think that ship
was sunk on purpose.

347
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:06,150
Now how the hell do you know
that's a torpedo hit?

348
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:08,160
A collision with another boat
can produce that hole.

349
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,143
I don't agree with you.

350
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:12,072
- This hole would not be so jagged...
- So what?

351
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:14,472
So what if they scuttle
their own boat?

352
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:17,122
I can't get bent outta shape
just because some people...

353
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:20,804
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

354
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:25,095
I know about rocks. I know about stones.
I don't know about Russian boats.

355
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:28,991
Plus, I bet you five dollars
it's a clerical error.

356
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:32,642
Hell, we sounded the horn on it.
Let the maritime people figure it out.

357
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:35,428
I gotta fix the lift lock.

358
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:38,309
Okay, two more days.

359
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:40,447
Let's have no waves.

360
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,130
Weather system on line.
Tracking meteorological patterns.

361
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:47,460
- Beginning scan.
- I hate...

362
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:49,184
waves.

363
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:54,623
You know that in Switzerland,
they speak four major languages?

364
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:57,562
- Ask me if I care.
- I do.

365
00:30:57,637 --> 00:31:00,125
When I get outta here,
I'm goin' there.

366
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:02,684
I'm gonna find a nice
snow-covered chalet...

367
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:07,164
warm little woman,
crackling fire, and ski.

368
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:14,425
If you're gonna do that, you should
wear what you wear to the beach.

369
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,841
I hate the beach.

370
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,754
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

371
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,924
- I don't believe it. You got 'em.
- Yeah, put it there.

372
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:24,893
What are you doing
with Beck's personnel records?

373
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,424
Watch. You'll see.

374
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:30,295
Four, zero, five, four...

375
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,799
eight, six.

376
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:35,037
You guys are so full of shit.
How stupid do you think he is?

377
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:37,080
Who's gonna use
their social security number?

378
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,555
Bingo!

379
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:43,967
That bottle's mine.

380
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:47,349
- Cute, DeJesus. Specimen cups?
- Loosen up, Bow.

381
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:50,556
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you.
- Not for me, thanks.

382
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:52,696
All you do is exercise.
You gotta live a little.

383
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:54,623
My astronaut training
starts in two days.

384
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:56,827
Forget space cadet.
I'll drink hers.

385
00:31:56,896 --> 00:32:00,191
What happens if he goes back
and finds the bottle missing?

386
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,874
He won't.
I put the vodka in here.

387
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:05,081
Smart lad.

388
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:06,613
Cheers.

389
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:11,797
- It's water.
- Beck switched it.

390
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:13,725
That son of a gun
doesn't trust us.

391
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:16,212
That pretty-boy little turd.
I'm gonna fix his ass.

392
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:18,522
- There goes our party.
- It's not bad.

393
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,924
- It's not bad at all.
- It's water.

394
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,091
Did I tell you
vodka's my favorite drink?

395
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:24,183
That was a pretty big one, huh?

396
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:26,484
You'd think we'd get
used to it by now.

397
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:29,934
You're wasting your time here.
This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

398
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:36,942
Yeah, I need an overhaul.
How's the training goin'?

399
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:41,649
It's going well.

400
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:44,085
I think I've got a good shot.

401
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,736
I just wish everyone would
stop giving me a hard time.

402
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,327
Yeah, I know what you mean.

403
00:33:50,358 --> 00:33:52,212
Why don't you give me a hand
and hit that button, huh?

404
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:57,712
- Push D.L.
- What?

405
00:33:57,781 --> 00:33:59,635
D.L.

406
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:06,929
Oh, man.

407
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:12,978
What are you doing down here?

408
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:15,760
Well, I'm trying to fix
this short in the lift lock.

409
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:17,932
What are you doing down here?

410
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:20,174
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

411
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:22,185
- You don't belong in a mine.
- You got that right.

412
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:25,330
But somebody just got
the brilliant idea...

413
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:28,013
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys.

414
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,188
I think maybe they thought that
just 'cause I could tell...

415
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:32,112
shit from silver,
I'd know how to run this place.

416
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:33,421
Do you?

417
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:37,065
You tell me.

418
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:40,208
I think you handled
DeJesus pretty well.

419
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:42,761
Yeah?

420
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:46,182
Well, that was luck.
I was scared to death.

421
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,521
What about Sixpack?

422
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:51,654
What about him?

423
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,080
Did you bust him because of me?

424
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:58,186
Maybe.

425
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:03,976
Well, I appreciate that.
But I'm okay.

426
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,103
Yeah, I know.

427
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,328
Good.

428
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:21,256
Oh, by the way, how did you know
they'd get into the vodka?

429
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:25,965
Hell, that's what I woulïve done.

430
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,381
Maybe you're more one of us
than you think.

431
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:48,139
Good morning.

432
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:51,969
Sorry.

433
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:55,785
Okay. That's good.

434
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,494
Just look at my forehead.

435
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:01,417
That's it.

436
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:08,201
Let me see your tongue.

437
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:14,174
Good morning, gentlemen.
What's wrong, Doc?

438
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:18,853
I'm getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover.

439
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:21,059
- Take off your shirt.
- It ain't no hangover.

440
00:36:21,129 --> 00:36:23,463
Feels about 1000 times worse.

441
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,535
How long did you have these spots?

442
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,455
- What?
- Don't touch it.

443
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:44,096
Well, as First Officer of the shack,
it's your call.

444
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:47,330
But if I were you,
I'd not be too hasty.

445
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,805
I don't get it.

446
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,572
Any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup...

447
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:56,987
won't look good on
an otherwise excellent record.

448
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:59,931
But like I said, it's your call.

449
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:09,116
Well, as bad as he is,
there's no way...

450
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:12,058
we're gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there.

451
00:37:12,132 --> 00:37:15,197
- He's tankin' on us.
- No, I don't think so.

452
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,137
I heard him last night,
and he didn't sound so good.

453
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:21,245
The company will consider that
when they look at our numbers.

454
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:24,927
Sweetheart, the company
doesn't give a damn about why.

455
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,882
The contract says,
if we miss our quota...

456
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,401
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month.

457
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:31,329
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

458
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:33,914
The bastarïs
definitely tanking on us.

459
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:36,506
- Yep, I think you're right.
- I wish you were, but he's not.

460
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,433
He's really sick.
He ain't comin' out today.

461
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:40,407
- Williams, take her down.
- That's terrific.

462
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:43,929
- Three months of work down the tubes.
- You're outta here, guys.

463
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:47,165
So, what, are you taking inventory?

464
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,950
No, Mr. Jones.
I'm getting ready to play Ping-Pong.

465
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:55,802
I'm goin' to work.
You got a problem with that?

466
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:57,596
- Work?
- Work.

467
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:12,410
- Try to hold as steady as you can.
- What the hell is it?

468
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:14,867
- I'm taking a little skin sample.
- Come on. Give me something.

469
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:16,884
Just a second.
Steady as you can.

470
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:20,253
Try to do it as quick as I can.
That's it. I got it.

471
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,220
Steady, steady. Easy.

472
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:29,083
It's all right.
Keep your hands off it.

473
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:31,004
Here. Hold that.

474
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,701
I'm gonna take a look at this
under the microscope.

475
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:11,440
Container 22 is full, sir.

476
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:14,001
This one's full, so let's run her
outta here and bring in a new one.

477
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:15,797
You got it.

478
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:33,454
"An organism of unknown origin."
No kidding.

479
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:35,983
Tell me something I don't know.

480
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:44,621
Goddamn it, take a guess.

481
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:50,217
Good work out there, Becky.
I mean, Mr. Beck.

482
00:40:50,288 --> 00:40:52,143
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

483
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:55,949
No harm done.

484
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:57,871
Just don't call me cracker.

485
00:40:58,768 --> 00:41:00,808
Perk up, sport.

486
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,971
How can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours?

487
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:09,736
Put this on.
I want you to examine him.

488
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:12,741
- I'm not a doctor.
- For this, you don't need to be.

489
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,283
Oh, Lord.

490
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,704
Am I wearing this 'cause
you think it might be contagious?

491
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,626
I don't know if it is
or it isn't.

492
00:41:47,692 --> 00:41:50,342
I don't know a damn thing.
Neither does anyone else.

493
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,128
I've been going back and forth
with Narragansett Naval all day...

494
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:55,050
consulting with the best people
in marine medicine...

495
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:56,969
the best people in virology.

496
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:59,304
They don't even believe
the symptoms I'm describing.

497
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:01,858
Their best guess,
and that's all it is...

498
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,232
is that before Sixpack died,
he was undergoing...

499
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:06,152
some form of genetic alteration.

500
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:08,290
Genetic alteration from what?

501
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,217
It could be a million things.

502
00:42:10,282 --> 00:42:13,064
Something in the food, the air.

503
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,708
Sixpack went in that ship,
and so did Williams.

504
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,976
I want to examine
the rest of the crew.

505
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,856
But I don't want to create a panic,
so until I get some answers...

506
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:24,775
I don't think we should tell them
that Sixpack is dead.

507
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:32,418
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles?
What is it?

508
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:34,463
It's a little difficult
to describe.

509
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,543
Christ, it would be
a hell of a thing...

510
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:38,819
if I went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing.

511
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,757
My wife would never
understand that at all.

512
00:42:43,015 --> 00:42:44,869
I don't think we have
to worry about that, do we?

513
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,789
She wouldn't understand that at all.

514
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,123
She'd think I was down here
screwing my head off or something.

515
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,684
Put on your shirt.

516
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,368
- It's all right?
- Yeah, you're fine.

517
00:42:57,446 --> 00:42:59,715
This whole thing is unnecessary, Doc.

518
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:02,683
The only skin problem
I can see is white people.

519
00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:07,780
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

520
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:10,049
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

521
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:13,378
- Anything wrong?
- No, I just wanted to see something.

522
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:15,583
That's all.

523
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:19,361
You think it has anything to do
with going on that ship?

524
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:21,434
Well, it's a possibility.
But if that was the case...

525
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:23,612
you'd be showing some symptoms,
wouldn't you?

526
00:43:23,683 --> 00:43:26,683
- I'm okay?
- You're fine.

527
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,609
No, really, you're fine.

528
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:31,456
Great. Thanks, Doc.

529
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:34,075
What do you mean, a skin problem?

530
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:36,153
Your skin changes?

531
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:40,121
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly.
- What, like a fish?

532
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:47,295
- Yeah, like a fish.
- I was just joking, Doc.

533
00:43:51,841 --> 00:43:54,208
You can finish
gettin' dressed out there.

534
00:43:57,088 --> 00:44:00,088
Oh, Bowman. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

535
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:10,359
- Generic alteration?
- Genetic.

536
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,726
Whatever. But you think it's
restricted to this one crew member?

537
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,645
- Well, so far, but...
- But what?

538
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,565
What if it turns out
to be nothing?

539
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,670
What are you talking about?
It's already killed one man!

540
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:24,249
But you have no proof that
this disease is contagious, do you?

541
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:26,707
And we've been wrong before,
haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

542
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:31,926
Look, Martin, I think
you're missing the point here.

543
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:34,364
My crew's in jeopardy.
I've seen this disease.

544
00:44:34,429 --> 00:44:36,284
And it's no day at the beach.

545
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:38,934
So by way of paragraph 539
of the manual...

546
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:41,874
I'm ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation...

547
00:44:41,948 --> 00:44:43,803
of all the personnel
on the shack.

548
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:45,875
It's your call,
but unfortunately...

549
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:48,468
we can't pick you up so soon.

550
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,704
There's a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of Cuba...

551
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,627
possibly coming your way.

552
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:56,921
And if it does, the company does not
want to risk losing you folks.

553
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,889
Are you saying you're not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time?

554
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:01,850
It shouldn't be a long delay.

555
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:04,249
Well, What's a long delay?
A day? A week? What?

556
00:45:04,314 --> 00:45:07,630
Twelve hours. We should know something
first thing in the morning.

557
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,877
- I'll keep you posted.
- You better be there.

558
00:45:11,162 --> 00:45:12,918
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours.

559
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,873
I promise.

560
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,127
Bow, are you okay?

561
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:33,166
Oh, my God. Come on.

562
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,015
Can you help us here?

563
00:45:41,111 --> 00:45:43,828
- Let's put her here.
- Come on. Take it easy.

564
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:48,790
It's all right.

565
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,797
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna go find Doc, all right?

566
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,074
Hey, Doc?
Maybe he's with Sixpack.

567
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:03,116
Doc? Hey, you in here?

568
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,945
Hey, man, how you doin'?

569
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:13,584
We made quota today, man, no thanks
to you, you dog, but we made it.

570
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:16,402
You won't believe this, man,
but Beck helped us out.

571
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:19,315
Yeah, we just brought Bowman in, man.

572
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,235
She don't look too good.

573
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,115
You know, I hope
what you got ain't catchin'.

574
00:46:25,555 --> 00:46:27,726
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

575
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:30,610
You go on back to sleep, okay?

576
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:33,489
I'll talk to you later, all right?

577
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:43,942
- I'm gonna go check the control room.
- Okay.

578
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:46,920
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Please don't go!

579
00:46:46,993 --> 00:46:50,309
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

580
00:46:50,385 --> 00:46:53,833
You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

581
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:47,691
My hair's coming out.

582
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:08,416
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

583
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,438
I don't understand.
I just left her here.

584
00:48:29,896 --> 00:48:31,303
It's Doc.

585
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,798
Oh, man.

586
00:49:20,355 --> 00:49:24,545
Other than that, there's not much more
that I can tell you about it...

587
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:29,143
except that none of you have
any of the symptoms.

588
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:32,350
And this disease, it killed Bow?

589
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,763
No, she killed herself.

590
00:49:39,266 --> 00:49:41,502
Hey, we're getting outta here
just in time.

591
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,675
That's a whole 'nother problem.

592
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:47,389
We're on hold for the pickup. There's
a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

593
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:50,523
- A hurricane?
- Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

594
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:54,455
Twelve hours? What're we gonna do?
We can't stay here for 12...

595
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:59,799
- What was that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

596
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,246
Okay.

597
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:22,493
Oh, my God.

598
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:24,413
What is this?

599
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:26,300
What's goin' on?

600
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:56,218
- Okay, get the door.
- Got it.

601
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,248
The contract states that you can't
dispose of a body without authorization.

602
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:06,966
Come on. Will you for once
forget about the contract?

603
00:51:07,035 --> 00:51:09,490
Section C of the Health and Safety Code.
Watch it.

604
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:13,809
Program that lock.

605
00:51:15,226 --> 00:51:17,975
Hey, I feel something.

606
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,929
What are you talkin' about?
They're dead.

607
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,131
Wait a minute. I feel something too.

608
00:51:22,201 --> 00:51:24,918
- Let's go.
- Somebody's alive in here.

609
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:26,895
- Come on.
- Let's flush it.

610
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:30,132
- "Flush it?" They're human beings!
- What if one's alive?

611
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,142
- How about a moment of silence?
- Let's do it.

612
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:35,118
- My God, they're alive!
- Let's have a look.

613
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,061
- Don't stop!
- What the hell was that?

614
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:43,662
Hit the button!

615
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:47,117
- Hit the lift button!
- Get outta there!

616
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,263
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

617
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:54,549
Come on!

618
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,741
Oh, God!

619
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:34,892
It's coming up now. That camera's gonna
move into this room. That's it.

620
00:53:34,957 --> 00:53:38,732
Some kind of sick bay or lab
or something. Hold it. Run it back.

621
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:43,045
That's it. Stop. Now move in.

622
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:47,808
See? It looks like a human skull,
but I don't know.

623
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:50,023
- There's something about it. It's...
- Bigger.

624
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:03,400
Well, somebody's been screwing around.
Just take a look at that hand.

625
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:06,500
- Look at the size of it.
- If you were tampering with genetics...

626
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:10,819
why stop with the base model?

627
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:13,956
Why not try to alter the human form?

628
00:54:14,026 --> 00:54:18,303
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live
underwater. Think of the possibilities.

629
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:20,233
Regeneration.

630
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,647
The ability to withstand
extreme cold, pressure...

631
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:26,623
Just think of it.
Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

632
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:29,512
So What's next? I mean, what if
we run outta airplanes one day?

633
00:54:29,577 --> 00:54:33,122
What are we gonna do?
Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

634
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:41,283
Loosely translated:
"Don't fuck with Mother Nature."

635
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,796
I better let the company know.

636
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:05,249
Have you ever thought
that they may suspect already?

637
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:08,516
Yeah. I thought about that.

638
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:11,428
I think they got some kind
of commitment to their people.

639
00:55:11,493 --> 00:55:13,794
Save that speech for your ad campaign.

640
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,795
This company's commitment is
to the almighty dollar.

641
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:20,446
If you think, based on what
we've told them, that Tri-Oceanic...

642
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:24,062
is gonna risk exposing themself
to potential market loss to save us...

643
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:26,433
you're in for
an eye-opening experience.

644
00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:27,874
Maybe.

645
00:55:29,379 --> 00:55:32,859
Maybe so. And I know your life's gone
a couple of bad rounds.

646
00:55:32,931 --> 00:55:36,989
But it doesn't necessarily mean
this whole company's one big bummer.

647
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,895
I think we got something here.

648
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,343
Son of a bitch.

649
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:12,127
I don't get it.
Why did they put it in the vodka?

650
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:16,469
Because it was an experiment, man.
They put the drug in the vodka!

651
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,398
They meant to trick them
into takin' it.

652
00:56:18,463 --> 00:56:21,147
That way, see, they didn't know
what they were drinkin'.

653
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:24,531
I mean, with us, they would have
put it in the coffee.

654
00:56:24,606 --> 00:56:26,843
- What are you talkin' about?
- Come on.

655
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,706
You know how mothers put the castor oil
in with orange juice?

656
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:33,651
They trick the baby into drinkin' it
so he don't know what he's drinkin.

657
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:36,955
That's the kind of shit
they was doin', man!

658
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,908
Fool. He coulïve got us all killed.

659
00:56:38,974 --> 00:56:42,835
You weren't holy when you were shooting
that vodka. It coulïve been anyone.

660
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:45,909
Well, Miss High and Mighty,
it doesn't seem to bother you none.

661
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:47,890
Yeah, it bothers me.

662
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:50,452
You deal with it your way.
I'll deal with it mine.

663
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:54,779
You know that in Gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes?

664
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,397
Sixty-four square miles.

665
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:03,088
How can you sit there goin', "Shh, shh,"
after what we just went through?

666
00:57:03,163 --> 00:57:06,327
And another thing. I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' about your goddamn skiin'.

667
00:57:06,395 --> 00:57:10,355
You don't know shit about skiin'.
They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

668
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,281
What about what we just saw?

669
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:16,372
Like Willie said, you deal with it
your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

670
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:20,533
- Doesn't anybody care what happened?
- What're you gonna do about it? Huh?

671
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:24,409
Sixpack and Bow are dead.

672
00:57:28,217 --> 00:57:30,966
I can't help what happened. Can you?

673
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:36,310
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
Anybody want anything?

674
00:57:37,336 --> 00:57:40,401
Eat? After what we just went through?

675
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,041
The storm's still holding its course.

676
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,590
What about that disease?
Still just the one crew member?

677
00:58:04,662 --> 00:58:07,051
No change. Still just the one.

678
00:58:35,603 --> 00:58:37,741
Everybody's jumpy. What are you doin'?

679
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,665
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

680
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:44,170
Look, Hazy, you gonna make me finish
this puzzle by myself, or what?

681
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:47,242
I should.
You know how long that took me?

682
00:58:47,314 --> 00:58:49,485
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

683
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:55,632
- I'll be right there.
- Okay. Hurry up.

684
00:59:37,966 --> 00:59:40,071
Holy shit!

685
00:59:41,197 --> 00:59:45,288
Please, God, help me!
Help me, Jonesy! Help me.

686
00:59:46,765 --> 00:59:49,612
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll be right back, okay?

687
00:59:49,676 --> 00:59:51,945
Don't leave me.
Jonesy, don't leave me!

688
00:59:54,572 --> 00:59:56,514
- Please.
- I'll be back.

689
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:05,828
Look! It's got Hazy!
Stay here and watch the door!

690
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,714
Don't let him out!
I'm gonna go get the doc.

691
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,513
I didn't want to tell her about Bowman.

692
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:23,967
I listened to Martin, and my mind said,
"She's full of shit."

693
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:25,896
It's got DeJesus! Come on!

694
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:57,797
Don't go in there.
Don't touch anything!

695
01:00:58,918 --> 01:01:01,307
What the hell you doin'?
You supposed to be watchin' the door!

696
01:01:01,382 --> 01:01:03,357
I won't watch that thing
without protection.

697
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,601
- That thing is my friend.
- Your friend is not human!

698
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,059
Shut up, both of you! Jones!
Let's go find him.

699
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:11,362
Okay? Come on. Let's go find him.
Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

700
01:01:12,933 --> 01:01:14,307
What's happening?

701
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:17,948
My God, she's out there.

702
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,875
All right. Jones, you come with me.

703
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,235
Doc, you and Cobb check your office
and the dorm. Let's go.

704
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,869
It's her scarf.

705
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:06,970
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

706
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,356
- What the hell you doin'?
- I've been trying to fix these lights.

707
01:02:10,432 --> 01:02:14,010
- What's going on?
- What got Sixpack and Bowman is here.

708
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,665
- What?
- It just got DeJesus.

709
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:45,110
All right. We're talkin' turkey.

710
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,563
Oh, my God.

711
01:02:58,459 --> 01:03:00,314
The blood supply.

712
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:03,833
Oh, my God.

713
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,168
It got the blood supply.

714
01:03:55,511 --> 01:03:57,649
It's growing. It's had a meal.

715
01:03:57,718 --> 01:04:00,140
- It needs blood?
- Apparently.

716
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:03,989
This is great. You're tellin' me we got
a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

717
01:04:04,054 --> 01:04:06,956
That's why that one on the ship
was dead. It needed blood.

718
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:10,575
- What one on that ship?
- Tell the rank-and-file the secret.

719
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,777
Whatever it is,
it appears to be a genetic aberration.

720
01:04:13,845 --> 01:04:17,358
- No shit.
- What're you trying to tell us?

721
01:04:17,429 --> 01:04:22,862
It has all the characteristics of
deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

722
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:27,851
regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

723
01:04:27,924 --> 01:04:30,739
But the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored...

724
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:34,382
seems to imply that is has
some other quality.

725
01:04:34,451 --> 01:04:37,353
- What?
- It absorbs its victim's intelligence.

726
01:04:37,427 --> 01:04:39,696
Intelligence may not be the right word.

727
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:43,919
The hell with semantics. Are you saying
it's part DeJesus, Sixpack and Bowman?

728
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:48,045
I don't know. I'd just be guessing.

729
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:52,871
But I do know the Russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves.

730
01:04:55,506 --> 01:04:57,611
Maybe to protect us all.

731
01:04:57,682 --> 01:05:02,286
Then I say we protect ourselves. Let's
escape into the air bubbles and get out.

732
01:05:02,353 --> 01:05:05,582
And hit the surface in a hurricane?
The storm'd rip those bubbles to pieces.

733
01:05:05,649 --> 01:05:09,129
- They'd never find us.
- We wouldn't stand a chance.

734
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,110
- What are we gonna do?
- I think we got one shot.

735
01:05:15,184 --> 01:05:19,439
Just one shot. We lure it to the swamp,
flush it out just like the other.

736
01:05:19,504 --> 01:05:21,446
How're we gonna do that?

737
01:05:28,622 --> 01:05:31,240
So we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes.

738
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:34,277
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

739
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:38,376
Mark. Got it?
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

740
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:41,577
If Jones and I aren't back here
in 30 minutes in the mess...

741
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:44,460
hurricane or nothin', you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass.

742
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,005
- Let's do it.
- Be careful with this.

743
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,597
- Don't worry. I don't want to give more.
- Take care.

744
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:52,807
I'll do my best.

745
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:54,731
Okay, let's go.

746
01:06:39,848 --> 01:06:42,149
You know, I was quite good once.

747
01:06:43,816 --> 01:06:46,631
When I did something,
it was important, you know?

748
01:06:50,184 --> 01:06:53,925
I developed drugs and techniques...

749
01:06:53,991 --> 01:06:56,805
that're used every day
by doctors all over the world.

750
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:02,077
- Made a difference.
- It still does.

751
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:07,909
This itches like hell.

752
01:07:12,518 --> 01:07:14,372
- I'm all right.
- Let me have a look.

753
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:16,292
It really itches.

754
01:07:19,556 --> 01:07:21,411
That's because it's healing.

755
01:07:22,692 --> 01:07:24,896
I'm gonna change that dressing
to make you more comfortable.

756
01:07:24,964 --> 01:07:27,353
- Where are you going?
- The infirmary.

757
01:07:27,429 --> 01:07:28,857
Without protection?

758
01:07:28,932 --> 01:07:31,266
- You shouldn't go out there.
- She's right, you know.

759
01:09:21,882 --> 01:09:24,948
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

760
01:09:25,018 --> 01:09:26,872
Here we go.

761
01:09:52,599 --> 01:09:55,665
- Take off your shirt.
- Sure.

762
01:09:55,735 --> 01:09:58,036
I'm cold.

763
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:01,583
Help me, please.

764
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,989
Oh, yeah, sure.

765
01:10:13,526 --> 01:10:15,947
Help me!

766
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:17,582
What's happening?

767
01:10:17,653 --> 01:10:19,376
Help!

768
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:44,050
- Willie! Run!
- Run!

769
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:45,969
Get over here!

770
01:11:05,105 --> 01:11:08,039
How are you doin'? All right?
Where's Doc and Cobb?

771
01:11:08,112 --> 01:11:10,185
- It got Doc.
- Wait a minute. It was just here.

772
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:13,038
- I know.
- Wait a second. You saw it?

773
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:17,065
- It was in Cobb. It was in him.
- Slow down. There's two of them?

774
01:11:18,128 --> 01:11:20,462
- Shit.
- All right.

775
01:11:20,528 --> 01:11:22,949
- How are you doin'?
- Okay.

776
01:11:23,023 --> 01:11:25,444
Okay, now what?

777
01:11:25,519 --> 01:11:28,650
How do you feel about big waves?

778
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,574
I love waves.

779
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:07,274
We're trapped.
The escape bubbles are gone.

780
01:12:07,339 --> 01:12:09,249
- The door.
- Hey, look at this.

781
01:12:09,323 --> 01:12:11,233
"I am fully aware of the finality
of my decision.

782
01:12:11,307 --> 01:12:14,373
It is my hope that our sacrifice
will mean that the human race...

783
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:16,353
will never know this awful mutation."

784
01:12:16,426 --> 01:12:20,223
- Our death warrant.
- Signed by the good doctor.

785
01:12:31,177 --> 01:12:32,900
Hell with it.

786
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:39,041
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm gonna find out...

787
01:12:39,112 --> 01:12:41,479
how far up Shit Creek we are.

788
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:54,591
- Thank goodness you're still alive.
- Where you been?

789
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:57,532
Get your ass out here now
and get us. Right now!

790
01:12:57,607 --> 01:13:00,574
Please calm down.
We haven't deserted you.

791
01:13:00,647 --> 01:13:03,810
Naturally, after we received Dr.
Thompson's message, we were concerned.

792
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:05,951
But we never would have deserted you.

793
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:07,778
When are you coming?

794
01:13:07,847 --> 01:13:10,748
- You said 12 hours.
- That's the bad news.

795
01:13:10,822 --> 01:13:14,466
The hurricane has turned your way.
Right now, it's on a course of...

796
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:17,151
Just answer the goddamn question.
When are you coming?

797
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:20,254
- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours?

798
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:22,594
I realize you must have gone
through hell...

799
01:13:22,661 --> 01:13:24,602
Gone? Bitch, we're still here!

800
01:13:24,676 --> 01:13:27,491
I can't control the weather.
Rest assured, your SOS...

801
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:30,239
was received by the coast guard
and the navy...

802
01:13:30,308 --> 01:13:33,853
and we will be responding
at the earliest, safest opportunity.

803
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:38,942
- Just don't promise us nothin'.
- I realize this must sound ridiculous.

804
01:13:39,012 --> 01:13:41,946
- No shit.
- Now please try and get some rest.

805
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:44,921
How are we gonna rest?
I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

806
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:47,383
- Get some rest?
- Save your breath.

807
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:51,200
- Damn. In 48 hours? No way.
- We don't have much choice, do we?

808
01:13:51,266 --> 01:13:54,561
I'll tell you what. I'll take a watch.
You all try to get some rest.

809
01:13:54,626 --> 01:13:58,336
I ain't gonna never be able
to sleep again. In life. Ever.

810
01:14:43,549 --> 01:14:46,135
"Request weather report, July 26."

811
01:14:46,206 --> 01:14:49,718
- "Data not available."
- Come on.

812
01:14:56,765 --> 01:14:58,139
"Files Closed."

813
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:00,986
- Oh, man.
- They know, don't they?

814
01:15:01,052 --> 01:15:06,103
Yeah. I think they're just sittin'
up there, decidin' what to do with us.

815
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:07,545
Maybe they have.

816
01:15:09,051 --> 01:15:12,728
- What're you looking for?
- I'm seeing how my investment's doing.

817
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:15,478
"The stock of Tri-Oceanic Corp.
Took a bath today...

818
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:18,394
when news of a tragic mining accident
was revealed to investors.

819
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,168
The board of directors was called into
a meeting in New York this afternoon.

820
01:15:22,235 --> 01:15:25,464
A spokesperson revealed that
the accident destroyed Shack Seven...

821
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,384
off the coast of Florida.

822
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,304
Eight miners are reported dead.
All bodies are missing.

823
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:32,500
Killed were Steven Beck,
Elizabeth Williams, Justin Jones...

824
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,984
Dr. Glen Thompson, Tony Rodero, Bridget
Bowman, G.P. Cobb, Buzz Parrish."

825
01:15:36,057 --> 01:15:37,999
Martin, you bitch.

826
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:40,047
Welcome to the union, boss.

827
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,975
We're all expendable.

828
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,744
- Doc, I owe you five dollars.
- Five dollars?

829
01:15:48,408 --> 01:15:50,829
- Emergency warning.
- Listen.

830
01:15:50,904 --> 01:15:53,391
- Countdown to implosion.
- The air's stopped.

831
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:56,081
Ten minutes and counting.

832
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:59,249
- They ripped open an air duct.
- Can we fix it?

833
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:01,806
There are 20 miles of pipe.
They coulïve tapped in anywhere.

834
01:16:01,879 --> 01:16:03,253
That's true.

835
01:16:07,254 --> 01:16:09,458
Cobb. Job security.

836
01:16:09,526 --> 01:16:11,914
It's that rattle in Corridor A.

837
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:15,219
You got it. It's showin' us where it is.

838
01:16:15,285 --> 01:16:18,252
- It's drawin' us out.
- It didn't waste any time, did it?

839
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:20,976
You can't go out there.
That's what it wants.

840
01:16:21,045 --> 01:16:24,340
If we lose enough air in here, the
internal pressure will drop, and crunch.

841
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:25,931
Implosion, babe.

842
01:16:26,004 --> 01:16:28,557
Wait. You don't think
I'm staying here?

843
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,315
Nine minutes to implosion.

844
01:16:35,252 --> 01:16:37,902
- It's over here!
- Is that it?

845
01:16:37,971 --> 01:16:39,465
Yeah.

846
01:16:41,683 --> 01:16:44,498
- It's going!
- We're losin' air faster than I thought.

847
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:50,094
- Go! Here.
- Don't spend all day down there.

848
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:52,301
Don't worry. I won't.

849
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,225
Let's do it.

850
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:07,529
Eight minutes to implosion.

851
01:17:26,671 --> 01:17:29,605
- Oh, no. Damn!
- Can we fix it?

852
01:17:31,118 --> 01:17:34,467
- Can we shut it down someplace else?
- Come on.

853
01:17:34,543 --> 01:17:38,437
- What do you think? I wanna die?
- We're not gonna die. What do we do?

854
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,365
- How should I know?
- You know this shack!

855
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:43,179
- I don't know!
- Come on! This shack's your home, man!

856
01:17:43,245 --> 01:17:47,042
The swamp. There's a backup air valve
at the swamp. If we...

857
01:17:49,997 --> 01:17:52,648
- What?
- I just saw Doc.

858
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:55,084
No, Jones. Let's get outta here.

859
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:56,523
Come on.

860
01:18:01,421 --> 01:18:03,243
Seven minutes to implosion.

861
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:07,906
- Look out!
- Watch out!

862
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:17,538
- Did you get it?
- I think we did it!

863
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:19,618
- I don't know!
- Hurry!

864
01:18:19,691 --> 01:18:22,690
Move it! The door's closing!

865
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:34,151
The other door's closing!

866
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:39,045
Willie, get out! Get out!

867
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,673
- Torch it!
- Careful!

868
01:18:40,744 --> 01:18:42,151
It's jammed!

869
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:54,086
Check that door!
Willie, get outta here!

870
01:18:54,152 --> 01:18:56,388
- The door's closing!
- Get that door!

871
01:18:57,927 --> 01:19:01,855
- Go! Go! Go!
- Six minutes to implosion.

872
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:03,552
Come on!

873
01:19:35,428 --> 01:19:38,494
Grab my hand!

874
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:43,611
Grab it! Come on!

875
01:19:45,123 --> 01:19:47,425
Go! Come on!

876
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,141
You got it.

877
01:19:57,186 --> 01:19:58,974
Come on!

878
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:06,016
Let me help him! Let me go!

879
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:07,804
The handsaw on the table!

880
01:20:15,905 --> 01:20:17,846
- Help him!
- Stay back!

881
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:32,693
Four minutes to implosion.

882
01:20:42,526 --> 01:20:44,381
There's no air.

883
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:50,810
The door's jammed!

884
01:20:54,845 --> 01:20:58,739
The air valve! It's too hot!
I can't get to it!

885
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,300
- Forget it! Get the suits!
- The suits? You crazy?

886
01:21:01,373 --> 01:21:04,023
Bring the lift bags!

887
01:21:05,084 --> 01:21:07,866
- How're we gonna get to the surface?
- Like this.

888
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:12,121
We'll triple the inflation ratio. We'll
float to the top like a balloon. Go!

889
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:18,008
Okay, let's hook 'em up.
Get in the suits.

890
01:21:18,075 --> 01:21:20,147
- What about yours?
- Get in the suit.

891
01:21:21,531 --> 01:21:24,629
Three minutes to implosion.

892
01:21:41,081 --> 01:21:42,804
Come on!

893
01:21:50,456 --> 01:21:52,278
Let's go!

894
01:21:52,344 --> 01:21:53,718
See you topside.

895
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,880
Get into your suit!

896
01:21:56,952 --> 01:21:59,854
Beck, get into the suit!

897
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:05,356
Don't be a fool!

898
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:13,582
Two minutes to implosion.

899
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,284
Kill me.

900
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:21,804
My God. DeJesus.

901
01:22:52,146 --> 01:22:53,521
Shit!

902
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:15,822
Oh, shit!

903
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:21,163
One minute to implosion.

904
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,024
You made it!

905
01:26:10,049 --> 01:26:12,732
Base to Coast Guard
Rescue Chopper 1437.

906
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:15,484
Make one more attempt in search area
and return to base.

907
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:30,836
- So where's the goddamn hurricane?
- You all right?

908
01:26:30,911 --> 01:26:32,766
- I made it.
- Yeah?

909
01:26:32,831 --> 01:26:36,955
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'll be all right. Okay.

910
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:44,405
Base to Rescue Chopper 1437.
Any visual contact?

911
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:46,333
- Negative.
- Return to base.

912
01:26:58,589 --> 01:26:59,963
It's cold.

913
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:04,470
- Hey!
- Here!

914
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,263
- Over here!
- Give me that last flare.

915
01:27:09,212 --> 01:27:11,000
There's a flare straight ahead.

916
01:27:11,068 --> 01:27:14,548
- Jones! Look!
- Chopper.

917
01:27:18,139 --> 01:27:20,048
- Sharks!
- Where are they?

918
01:27:20,123 --> 01:27:21,617
- Too close!
- Stay close.

919
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,152
Stay close!

920
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:34,677
Talk about having a bad day.

921
01:27:44,985 --> 01:27:46,807
- Help!
- Yes! Come on!

922
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:56,017
- Jesus!
- Willie!

923
01:27:56,088 --> 01:27:58,160
- Get those people up!
- Go!

924
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:01,813
- Grab a hand!
- Get outta here!

925
01:28:13,366 --> 01:28:15,787
It's got Jones!

926
01:28:15,862 --> 01:28:17,324
Come back!

927
01:28:17,398 --> 01:28:19,502
Don't! Save yourself!

928
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,738
Come back!

929
01:28:35,348 --> 01:28:37,006
Say "Aah," motherfucker!

930
01:28:41,076 --> 01:28:43,083
Let's get outta here!

931
01:29:00,722 --> 01:29:03,405
Helicopter 405 heading back
to platform P.O.C.

932
01:30:05,932 --> 01:30:09,347
They don't want anything else
to do with it, you know?

933
01:30:12,235 --> 01:30:13,991
You made it!

934
01:30:15,052 --> 01:30:17,921
No one back at Tri-Oceanic
believed me.

935
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:22,185
But I never gave up on you once.
How do you feel?

936
01:30:23,275 --> 01:30:25,609
Better. A lot better.
