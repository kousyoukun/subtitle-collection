1
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,385
We have reached
the target level.

2
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,565
What's happening?

3
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:54,627
Fast, fast, fast!

4
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:56,409
Go! Go! Go!

5
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,964
Run for your life.

6
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,699
Oh, no, the door is closing.

7
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:05,003
Aryan, let's move!

8
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,194
Tanga, please

9
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:10,459
come out of the water.

10
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:11,412
It's not safe!

11
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,358
Tanga! Tanga!

12
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:25,399

13
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:30,726
Please save us!

14
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,600
Come on, Aryan!

15
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:33,584
Hurry up!

16
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:14,161
Sago, a baby elephant, is stuck.

17
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,417
Hurry up! We'll rescue it.

18
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,728
Bud, it's not a damsel

19
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,635
but a baby elephant.

20
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,248
We are not strong enough

21
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,011
to retrieve it from the pit.

22
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,000
It's not an easy job.

23
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:20,885
It's a poor thing.

24
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:22,150
It can't get out on its own.

25
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,299
Look, its parents
are trumpeting.

26
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:24,925
They should've raised it right.

27
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:26,917
Stop gawking and help me.

28
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:28,674
Son, they're are dangerous.

29
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:29,724
They won't understand

30
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,112
that you're trying to rescue it.

31
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:32,312
They are intelligent

32
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:33,487
enough not to harm us.

33
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:34,847
Do you mean to say we're dumb?

34
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:35,939
Hey!

35
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,100
Hey, enough with the wailing!

36
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,457
I get it when humans get lost in

37
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:40,658
their phones and
fall into the pits.

38
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:41,290
What's wrong with you?

39
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:41,972
You should watch out!

40
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,327
Humans obstruct their paths

41
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,029
with statues and electric posts.

42
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,958
Do you expect them to use

43
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,010
Google Maps to avoid pitfalls?

44
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,100
We're friendlies. Don't worry!

45
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:50,940
Hold your trunks! We're

46
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:51,720
not harming your child.

47
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:52,389
Hold this for me!

48
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:56,391
Keep pulling it.

49
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,088
Hey, someone, please help.

50
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,756
No one will come forward.

51
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:02,744
Either it should

52
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:03,557
climb out on its own.

53
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:04,201
Or should we bend

54
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:04,959
down and pull it up.

55
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,089
Move! Move! Move! Move!

56
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,311
What are you going to do?

57
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:23,130
Why are you feeding it now?

58
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:31,237
Pull up!

59
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:38,219
Come on, climb up.

60
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:38,995
Keep climbing.

61
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:39,670
Hold it tight!

62
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:40,792
Climb up. Later you can eat.

63
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,346
Sweetheart, a bit more effort.

64
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:44,815
Oh, God!

Hey! Hey! Stop licking me.

66

Go ahead. Be careful.

67

Go safe!

68
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,103
It's okay to have a child.

69
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,132
But you must protect it well.

70
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,464
Be careful and take it home.

71
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:59,034
It takes after its mother.

72
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:00,641

00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:39,173
We can't see it!

176
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,253
You don't see it, you say!

177
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,297
Hello!
Yes!

178
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:45,186
That "Hello" is for me.

179
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,112
Please come over here.

180
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,167
I found your phone
on the ground.

181
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:48,710
Oh!

182
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:50,850
Thank you.

183
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:53,055
Please climb up!

184
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:55,417
Please!

185
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,085
Raise your left hand.

186
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,112
Follow me.

187
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:07,628
The left hand is fine.

188
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,390
Now, your right hand.

189
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,346
45 degrees like this.

190
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:12,331
Am I doing it right?
Yes!

191
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,253
Now look up in the sky.

192
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:18,875
Wow!
Yeah...

193
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,219
Now, do you see the stars?

194
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,961
I can even see the moon.

195
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,431
I'm not asking you.

196
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,179
Do you all see it?

197
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,884
This is called Orion

198
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:30,438
"A hunter's star"

199
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,599
Madam, now we
can see it clearly.

200
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,608
Not just the hunter's star...

201
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,278
I can see the
farmer's star too.

202
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:38,923
There he goes!

203
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:39,950
Everyone scram.

204
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:40,950
Come on, let's leave.

205
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:41,603
Save yourself.

206
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:42,626
He won't stop talking.

207
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,245
First, we need to save

208
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,220
agriculture from
people like him.

209
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:44,930
Everyone scram!

210
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,004
There's no audience when

211
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,227
we talk about agriculture.

212
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:49,096
Come with me.

213
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:54,461
I think she's inside the house.

214
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,544
Sago, how could they leave

215
00:14:58,556 --> 00:14:59,812
without saying goodbye?

216
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:00,871
That confirms they don't

217
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:02,199
consider you as a human being.

218
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,485
Mind your business.

219
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,698
That's what I said!

220
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:14,107
What are these? A

221
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,443
vast herd is flying in.

222
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,846
Where are they headed?

223
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,468
Hey, it's approaching our farm.

224
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,945
Oh, no!

225
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:23,814
Hey! Hey! Hey!

226
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:27,501
Please don't make me angry.

227
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:28,953
Why are you begging?

228
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,508
There's a variety of

229
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,928
farms next to ours.

230
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:34,293
Instead of raiding that farm...

231
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:35,621
you are raiding an

232
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:37,018
innocent sunflower farm.

233
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:37,826
You have a point.

234
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:39,316
I asked you to use pesticides,

235
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,953
but you chose organic remedies.

236
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:42,733
Now, face the consequences!

237
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:43,752
Don't swat at me.

238
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:44,781
Swat off the locusts.

239
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:47,151
Hey, get away from here!

240
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,016
Hey!

241
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:51,048
Hey! Damn it!

242
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:53,595
We can't chase them away.

243
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,434
They have surrounded the farm.

244
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,292
We're doomed!

245
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:03,042
Everything is ruined!

246
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:04,670
All other farms in

247
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:05,510
the village are safe.

248
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:07,586
But your farm is ruined.

249
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,217
If you start caring
about pests and

250
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,714
insects, you can't
continue farming.

251
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:11,864
Son, only when one gets

252
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,198
destroyed does another live.

253
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:14,046
Why don't you get

254
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:15,150
destroyed, and we'd live?

255
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:16,274
If we kill all the

256
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,425
pests and insects,

257
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:17,949
how will we continue

258
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:18,689
agriculture in the future?

259
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:19,530
If you stick to

260
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,297
your principles...

261
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:21,080
I'd have no choice but to

262
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:21,937
use the pesticides on me.

263
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:22,938
Don't be dramatic, Ma.

264
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:23,818
If we use pesticides to

265
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:24,842
kill pests and insects...

266
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:25,434
It'll turn into

267
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:26,170
poison for the soil.

268
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,132
How does it become a poison?

269
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,647
Fine, then use it as a perfume.

270
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:30,089
Don't spray it on

271
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:30,782
the head. I'll lose hair.

272
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:31,627
You said it's not a

273
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,338
poison. What now?

274
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,767
We cannot win an

275
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,374
argument with your son.

276
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:35,965
Let's go!

277
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:37,477
A good harvest
is not important.

278
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:37,987
Harvesting good

279
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:38,727
produce is essential.

280
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:39,702
One day, I'm going to

281
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:40,719
knock your daylights off.

282
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:44,532
Let's go!

283
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,653
Anna, the clutch is loose.

284
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,339
The tractor keeps shutting down.

285
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:57,270
I was going to bring it

286
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,277
myself to get it serviced.

287
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,081
Please fix it soon. I have

288
00:16:59,093 --> 00:16:59,772
a lot of pending work.

289
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,737
Listen up! Do I look

290
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,772
like a mechanic to you?

291
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:03,577
[sarcastically] Oh, which

292
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,503
district Collector are you?

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,708
I ought to!
What?

294
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:07,037
You took a loan. But haven't

295
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:08,534
paid the interest
or the principal.

296
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:09,683
Are you kidding me?

297
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:13,162
Ma, did you take
a loan from him?

298
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:14,924
Hey, how much did she borrow?

299
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:18,362
Thirty thousand and...

300
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,217
Thirty thousand?

301
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:20,558
Three lakhs!

302
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,490
Three lakhs?
Yes!

303
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,288
He's right!

304
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:24,920
It's not like I can depend on my

305
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,451
grownup son to
take up responsibility.

306
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:27,708
The ruckus you create

307
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,904
is costing me money.

308
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,784
You can sort out

309
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:31,057
your differences later.

310
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,689
You can take back
your vehicle after

311
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:34,354
you clear your loan
of 3,30,000 rupees.

312
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,317
Do you feel ashamed?

313
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,678
I don't! It looks beautiful.

314
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:41,021
Only after the
vehicle left could

315
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,134
we see the beautiful mountains.

316
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:43,159
Amazing view!

317
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:44,955
You may not be

318
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:45,860
ashamed of yourself.

319
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,038
Hereafter, I can't live in

320
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,314
the village with this shame.

321
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:49,794
I trusted you enough!

322
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,242
Thaenmozhi's daughter

323
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,780
works as a maid in Madras.

324
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,706
I will go to Madras!

325
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:54,910
I'm sure I can get

326
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:55,916
a job as a maid.

327
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:04,140
Okay, Ma! When are you leaving?

328
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:11,997
Ma, you're going to

329
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:13,463
Madras. So please be careful.

330
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:15,345
Also, I have challenged him to

331
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,453
pay the loan back
with your salary.

332
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,946
Please eat on time.

333
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:20,294
Don't use the soap

334
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,618
to wash the dishes.

335
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:22,808
It will make your skin itchy.

336
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,927
Instead, mix lime

337
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:24,880
with tamarind...

338
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:25,950
also add ash to it

339
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,141
Are you really my son?

340
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:29,386
You're not even offering

341
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,573
to go instead of me.

342
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,569
If I go, then who will take

343
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,125
care of our milk business?

344
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,391
You're weak in maths,

345
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,587
and they'll cheat you.

346
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,408
It's not like the turnover

347
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,049
is in the millions...

348
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:39,354
to worry about mathematics.

349
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:40,873
Thirtyfive rupees...

350
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:41,375
she's capable of

351
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,041
counting that money.

352
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:42,860
Stop making excuses.

353
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,212
Fine, who will take
care of the farm?

354
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:45,311
How does it matter who takes

355
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:46,888
care of the field
that insects infest?

356
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:51,822
Sweetheart!

357
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:54,664
I still believe in
what my father said:

358
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,300
the soil belongs to
pests and insects.

359
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,652
You feed the pigeons.

360
00:18:58,823 --> 00:18:59,769
Don't feed salty food to

361
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:01,031
the dog that just gave birth.

362
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:02,276
And the birds...

363
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:03,497
You don't have to do

364
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,924
anything. Don't shoo them away.

365
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:06,439
Until I return, do

366
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,738
everything as I do.

367
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,101
I understand you want your

368
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:12,321
son to live proud
in this village.

369
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,043
I will go!

370
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,228
I will return only
when you believe

371
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:16,838
that I can live
in any situation.

372
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,902
Okay?

373
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,414
Tamizh, are you

374
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,693
telling the truth?

375
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:22,518
Please give me the bag.

376
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:25,441
I switched your clothes to mine.

377
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,279
Hey, what will
you do over there?

378
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,429
Don't worry. I've given

379
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:30,598
him my friend's contact.

380
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:31,815
He will take care of him.

381
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,241
Don't worry about him.

382
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:35,001
It's time you leave. Go!

383
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:35,878
I'm leaving!

384
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:37,675
Anna, start the vehicle.

385
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:39,019
Keep going during the travel.

386
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,603
If you stop, he will

387
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:40,305
return to the village.

388
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:41,424
Keep driving nonstop.

389
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:42,709
Tata!
Don't come back.

390
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:28,822
In every era, a source of

391
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,518
energy has dominated the world.

392
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,748
That energy's
demand and drain...

393
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:33,635
is the beginning of

394
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:34,529
another energy's inception.

395
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,590
In 2030, the energy demand

396
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,390
will be 400 times over.

397
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:40,477
But fuel? We won't even have

398
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,032
half of it that's
available today.

399
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,514
When the world is running behind

400
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:44,899
an alternate source of energy...

401
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:46,855
we will be the only source of

402
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,282
energy that no one will reject.

403
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:49,681
How can you be so

404
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,728
confident about it?

405
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,165
Firstworld countries are

406
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:54,009
technically more
advanced than us.

407
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:54,860
Not anymore!

408
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,143
Our target is Nova Gas!

409
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,262
It's available at a depth

410
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,229
far from human reach.

411
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,625
Are you wondering

412
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,385
how we reach that depth?

413
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:07,987
This is Sparc!

414
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:09,937
On earth...

415
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,781
it's a powerful element that

416
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:13,328
is beyond your imagination.

417
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:15,258
As you think, it's

418
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,526
not a human creation.

419
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:17,823
Gift of nature!

420
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,758
Let me explain
about the reactor.

421
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,713
We will dig into the depth that

422
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,298
no one has ever done on earth.

423
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:24,295
The socalled

424
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:25,850
Firstworld countries...

425
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,719
advanced technology It

426
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:27,782
won't work at that depth.

427
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:29,460
Only this Sparc has the power

428
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,987
to overcome the pressure...

429
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,206
and reach the Nova

430
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:33,657
gas without affecting it.

431
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,618
Most importantly...

432
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,416
there's only one Sparc

433
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:38,822
in the entire world.

434
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:39,978
You really think you

435
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,008
can supply energy...

436
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,519
to the entire world from a

437
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:44,024
small mine in Madagascar?

438
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,626
That was just a trial run.

439
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,304
We possess more extensive

440
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:48,368
sources than Madagascar.

441
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,497
We will install the largest gas

442
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,501
plant in South India, Chennai.

443
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:55,804
Under the earth's surface,

444
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:57,381
an abundant source of

445
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:59,159
Nova gas is waiting for us.

446
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:00,241
Will the Indian

447
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,375
government allow it?

448
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:02,203
Under the name of

449
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,313
Frackingprocess scheme...

450
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,622
the initial level of

451
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:05,610
work has begun.

452
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:06,746
In the future, if we hit any

453
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,001
snag, we have political support.

454
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:08,788
I'm not worried

455
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,789
about the politicians.

456
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,701
It's the people we

457
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:11,576
have to convince.

458
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,028
They'll be protesting on the

459
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:14,748
streets over
everything these days.

460
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,167
That's why I selected

461
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:17,311
an abandoned mine.

462
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,335
So there is no

463
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:19,266
chance of protests.

464
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:20,534
Soon, we will begin

465
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:21,717
the drilling process.

466
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:23,508
Thank you.

467
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:24,571
Stop it, please!

468
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:26,311
In South Africa,

469
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:27,477
during the R&D of this project

470
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,534
hundreds of lives were lost.

471
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,468
How many have you

472
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,626
planned to sacrifice this time?

473
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:31,670
No, Mr. Arjun...

474
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:33,079
It's not right to mix

475
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:34,276
business with sentiments.

476
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:35,437
What happened out there

477
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:36,542
was an accident. That's it!

478
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,260
Sorry to say this.

479
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:40,617
I can't support a person

480
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:42,829
who'd do anything for money.

481
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:43,721
I'm out of this.

482
00:22:50,985 --> 00:22:52,026
Do you think this will be...

483
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:53,971
Gentlemen, please don't worry.

484
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:56,177
To clear all his doubts...

485
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:57,263
the upcoming

486
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,185
demonstration is the answer.

487
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,453
Humans are not going

488
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,471
to work inside the mines.

489
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,221
This guy can bear anything,

490
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,733
like pressure,
heat, and electricity.

491
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:42,182
Please make way.

492
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:43,770
Sir...

493
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:46,868
Help me with the address?

494
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,299
I don't know!

495
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,125
Akka, please hold

496
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,363
on for a minute.

497
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:51,171
Can you please help

498
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:51,949
me with this address?

499
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,489
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

500
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,043
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

501
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:57,331
Hey, let go!

502
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,668
Hey! Oh, no! My chain.

503
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,760
Hey!
Bring me the knife.

504
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:03,183
Hey, let go!
Hey!

505
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,597
Hey, throw it to me.

506
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,910
Oh, God, my chain.

507
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:06,540
Let's go!

508
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:08,191
They're stealing my chain.

509
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,262
Oh, God!
Go! Go! Go!

510
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:11,238
Oh, God! Please save my chain.

511
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,136
Oh, no, they're

512
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:13,191
stealing my chain.

513
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,715
Oh, no, bloody thieves.

514
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:16,846
Hey, give it to me.

515
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:18,482
Oh, no! Give it to me.

516
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:19,340
How dare you?

517
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,151
Hey!

518
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:22,901
It's not a gold chain.

519
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:23,555
Not a gold chain?

520
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:24,449
Please escape from here.

521
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:25,365
Why did you create

522
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:26,213
a scene, woman?

523
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,816
Hey, peg yourself to be a hero.

524
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,472
I'm going to crack

525
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,012
open your skull!

526
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:31,535
Hey, get him! Don't

527
00:24:31,547 --> 00:24:32,355
let him escape.

528
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:33,582
Hey, don't let him get away.

529
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,051
Oh, no!
Hey!

530
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:40,698
Hey, watch out!

531
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,378
Stop!

532
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:48,858
Hey, how dare you spin

533
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,684
us around in our own area?

534
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,682
I will handle you

535
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:51,902
when I get hold of you.

536
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:54,486
Spit on him!

537
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,065
Get him. Don't spare him!

538
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:02,668
Let it go.
It should rise slowly.

539
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:07,143
How about now?

540
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:10,612
Did you see it?
Tysa!

541
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:12,909
You're not just holding

542
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,924
a rope but my life.

543
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,018
Shall we let go of the rope?

544
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,060
I heard it. I'll kill you!

545
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:16,650
You heard it?

546
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,182
Akka, the brake is not working.

547
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,478
Sorry!

548
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:24,159
God help me!

549
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:25,830
I don't know where I am going.

550
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:27,223
Please sleep more for a while.

551
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,573
Damn it! We lost him!

552
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,688
Akka, help me if

553
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,916
you have a brake.

554
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,421
Boss, please check now.

555
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:42,586
Anna! Anna! Anna!

556
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,213
Oh, no, it flew

557
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,032
to the 24th floor.

558
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:47,767
Hey, the balloon is

559
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,682
flying away. Catch it.

560
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:49,900
Come on, help me!

561
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:51,870
Come on!

562
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:54,610
Oh, God, no!

563
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,040
Oh, no! Boss, we're flying

564
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:57,979
along with the balloon.

565
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,112
Where are you
guys flying off to?

566
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:00,638
Hey, my pants are

567
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,720
coming off. Let go!

568
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:03,423
Oh, God!

569
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,721
Hey! Hey! Don't let the

570
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,643
balloon fly away. Oh, no!

571
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:09,539
Stop!

572
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:10,443
You did not just let
go of the balloon...

573
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:10,766
Let go of me.

574
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:11,321
Hear me out for a minute.

575
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,031
...you let go of
our Boss's life.

576
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:12,703
Please hear me out.

577
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:13,539
He won't understand...

578
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:14,440
Sir, please...

579
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:16,492
Where the hell
did you come from?

580
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:17,455
I'm from Poombarai.

581
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:19,338
It's a neighbouring village.

582
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,885
Hey! You should pay

583
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,244
up two and a half lakhs.

584
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:23,323
Hey, balloon vendor!

585
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,397
You want me to
pay two and a half

586
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:25,595
lakhs for a balloon
children play with.

587
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:26,568
It's not the price of the

588
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:27,705
balloon but the project's value.

589
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:29,015
I've paid one and a half

590
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,799
lakhs to get
permission to fly it.

591
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:32,454
What kind of project

592
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,182
with a balloon?

593
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:35,119
Boss, I'll deal with him.

594
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,774
Hey, look at the building.

595
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:37,941
The girl on the 11th

596
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:39,611
floor's birthday is tomorrow.

597
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:40,999
To surprise her

598
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,773
sharp at midnight...

599
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:43,638
we tied the balloon

600
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,697
to the light and let it fly.

601
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,721
But you ruined everything.

602
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,862
Surprise using balloon!

603
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:50,985
It's an amazing idea!

604
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,040
If we had succeeded in

605
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:53,307
wishing her at midnight...

606
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,657
the lover of that

607
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:56,182
girl would've paid us.

608
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:57,587
You ruined our business.

609
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,038
That means you guys

610
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,330
make arrangements.

611
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:02,173
Boss, he's calling us brokers!

612
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,486
Take him with us!

613
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:06,886
I'm here in Chennai because I'm

614
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,502
drowning in debt
back in my village.

615
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:09,243
Why would you come to

616
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,305
Chennai if you're
drowning in debt?

617
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:11,492
It's because of you people

618
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,415
the city is overpopulated.

619
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:13,178
Don't expect me

620
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,151
to feel sorry for you.

621
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,201
You will have to work for

622
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:15,845
me to pay your way out.

623
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:18,381
Boss, he's challenging

624
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:19,166
you to a fight.

625
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,522
You can extract my

626
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,657
hard work... Boss!

627
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,878
As it is, we're sharing

628
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,798
one plate of idlis.

629
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:26,369
Now we have another member.

630
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:27,004
I won't ask for

631
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:27,737
idlis, colleagues.

632
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:28,385
Only briyani!

633
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:29,886
You are not aware of

634
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,987
our Boss. Step outside.

635
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:35,761
What is the place? It's so huge!

636
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,690
This is where they make biryani.

637
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:38,932
Hey, set it down.

638
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:40,049
You pick it up.

639
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:41,424
Me?
Yes! Go ahead!

640
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:43,427
At least now, hear me out.

641
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,057
Tell me.

642
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:46,085
This is my story.

643
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,377
It's an average story.

644
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:55,923
"Be merry with Magizh."

645
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:57,845
Why do you look surprised?

646
00:27:58,127 --> 00:27:59,210
This is the safest

647
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,377
place in the city.

648
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,467
Even during the Bloods,

649
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,690
there was no water logging.

650
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:03,834
Hey, it's pronounced Flood!

651
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:04,570
Teach him that.

652
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:06,132
Agriculture, locusts... None

653
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,868
of your stories are convincing.

654
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:09,382
Why did you come to the city?

655
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:10,128
Boss, it's not like

656
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:11,799
he's a sleeper cell.

657
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,320
He's in the city
to impress a girl

658
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:14,547
and take her
back to his village.

659
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,065
I'm telling you the truth.

660
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,010
Trust me!

661
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:17,809
I've worked with him for

662
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,963
years, still, he
does not trust me.

663
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,619
Boss, you received a new order.

664
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:21,947
Office mode on!

665
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:23,258
Moding out, Boss!

666
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:26,414
Hi, sir.

667
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,682
Hi! Hello! How can I help you?

668
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,137
I've been in love with

669
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:30,221
a girl for four years.

670
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:31,401
One girl, you say!

671
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:32,611
She's a very good girl.

672
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,076
She's a modern, homely,

673
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,516
and softnatured girl.

674
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:36,547
Wow, great breed!

675
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,752
How can I help you?

676
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:38,852
Sir, when I type

677
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,359
"beauty" on my iPhone...

678
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:41,767
it autocorrects to her name.

679
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:42,792
You should hear her speak.

680
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,174
I won't speak smack anymore.

681
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,349
Please get to the point.

682
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,472
Sir, tomorrow is her birthday.

683
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:47,553
I want to surprise

684
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:48,634
her sharp at midnight.

685
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,533
You see...

686
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:51,065
we have many packages like soft,

687
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,995
hardcore, middleeast,
and virtual reality.

688
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,307
Sir, she works in software.

689
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:54,901
Very good!

690
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:56,432
I'll pick the soft mode.

691
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,220
Thank you.

692
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,619
You have a job now!

693
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:02,439
Go with him...
Okay, Boss!

694
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:04,534
Let's all go together.

695
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:07,120
Instead of working for him, I

696
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,330
could've sold garlic
back in the village.

697
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:09,924
Here you go!

698
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:11,542
Hey, Tysa!

699
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:12,395
The girl should

700
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,432
not forget this day.

701
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:14,276
Okay, Boss!

702
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:16,963
Boss, today's her birthday.

703
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,442
Even if we don't do anything,

704
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:19,705
she won't forget the date.

705
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,439
Tysa...
Let's go!

706
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:28,753
The boys have entered the arena.

707
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,299
Now it'll be "cut
one twopiece."

708
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:31,775
Did you say two piece?

709
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,416
I mean to say we'll

710
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:33,089
hit the bull's eye.

711
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:35,041
Colleague...

712
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:37,721
we're entering like thieves.

713
00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:38,684
What if the people

714
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:39,713
spot us and beat us up?

715
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,134
If we get whacked by the

716
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,784
public, The Boss pays us more.

717
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:44,893
When we are short on cash

718
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,026
we use the bike keys to

719
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:47,128
make marks on our faces.

720
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:47,904
That means I can

721
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,018
pay off my debt sooner.

722
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:50,752
But our Boss is now aware of it.

723
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,078
Let alone a scratch, he doesn't

724
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,260
care even if we lose a kidney.

725
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,246
Tamizh, we should

726
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:56,721
quickly finish our job.

727
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:57,393
Sure! Go ahead!

728
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,455
Hey, come over here!

729
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:11,654
Sir, I've been in love

730
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,760
with a girl for four years.

731
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,042
You should listen to her voice.

732
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,878
She has completely smitten me.

733
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:17,981
Hey, that's someone

734
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:19,471
else's girlfriend. Put it down.

735
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:20,784
Come on!

736
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,938
I was right about you.

737
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:24,659
Come on!

738
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:33,114
Bro, I hope the plan will work.

739
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:34,997
Boss, this is the basic level.

740
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,122
You can check with your

741
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,387
lover about our execution.

742
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:40,089
I hope you'll
execute it perfectly.

743
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:41,021
Boss, he's annoying.

744
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,502
Hey, not just your girlfriend...

745
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,207
the entire Cauvery apartment

746
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,735
will light up with love.

747
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,661
Did you say Cauvery apartment?

748
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,963
My girlfriend is in
Godavari apartment.

749
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:50,599
Oh, no!

750
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:53,267
This is Cauvery. But his

751
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,541
girlfriend is in Godavari.

752
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:56,048
So, the names got mixed up.

753
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,607
Super!
I'm sorry, Boss!

754
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:01,883
Sir, I'll present you

755
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:03,625
with an extreme offer.

756
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:04,721
Why don't you ditch

757
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,008
the Godavari apartment...

758
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:07,712
and pick the Cauvery apartment?

759
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:10,273
Hey!

760
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,167
Have you ever successfully

761
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:12,878
completed one job?

762
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:13,596
No, Boss!

763
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:25,182
Security!

764
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:28,143
Security!

765
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:35,785
Oh!

766
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:51,331
Hey, I'm speaking

767
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,528
to you. I said stop!

768
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:54,473
Don't create a scene!

769
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:56,573
Don't you hear me?

770
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,135
Hey, who is it?

771
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:42,064
This is the Earth

772
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:42,846
of the Solar system.

773
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:43,896
This is our 324th

774
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,026
secret visit to earth.

775
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:46,667
Congrats on your first visit.

776
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,415
The most dangerous
species in the

777
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,782
universe, humans
live on this planet.

778
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:57,148
Stay hidden. Don't let

779
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,265
the humans find you.

780
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,467
Don't trust the humans.

781
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,083
You should not alter the course

782
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:02,494
of any human or living beings.

783
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,242
Don't eat junk food

784
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:07,565
that humans consume.

785
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,256
Set aside your personal

786
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:11,430
opinions and
strictly follow orders.

787
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:12,719
Unfortunately, if

788
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:14,019
humans capture you...

789
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:16,453
immediately kill yourself.

790
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:27,792
Polythene: It'll take

791
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:29,190
300 years to decompose.

792
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,487
Hey, excuse me!

793
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:55,226
Aren't you Ramasamy's son?

794
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:57,664
His drinking problem has

795
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,573
brought you to the streets.

796
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:03,899
Here you go. Get

797
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:04,789
something to eat.

798
00:34:09,538 --> 00:34:10,708
Paper: It'll take two

799
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,862
weeks to decompose.

800
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:22,149
Your first project

801
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:22,957
itself was a flop.

802
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:24,164
You don't seem upset about it.

803
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:24,920
I did get upset.

804
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,690
You talk too much!

805
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,069
What was the sound?

806
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:31,232
This is why I don't

807
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:32,125
shift to second gear.

808
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:33,435
It makes a lot of sound.

What happened?

848
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:25,979
Hey, standby!

849
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,162
I think the security

850
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:41,380
function is malfunctioning.

851
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:11,358
Aryan!

Aryan, what happened?

853
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:31,832
Something's not right!

854
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:34,280
Release the gas, goddammit!

855
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,596
Immediately destruct yourself.

856
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:07,549
Immediately destruct yourself.

857
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:11,838
You don't drink or smoke.

858

859
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,979
good at falling in love?

860
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:23,671
I never expected you to leave

00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,145
on this dangerous mission.

862
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,070
I made you wait for a long time.

863
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:28,088
In return, don't

864
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,371
make me wait for you.

865
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:30,705
Please come back soon.

866
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,434
I love you.

867
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:03,723
What?

868
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:18,948
[sings a Tamil song]

869
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:20,786
Anirudh composed a good song.

870
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,379
It's you who is drunk.

871
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:26,778
What is it?

872
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,372
Hey! Hey!

873
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:15,227
How did you manage to

874
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,785
park on top of the building?

875
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:21,675
According to Psalm 7:15...

876
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,244
The Lord says that

877
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:25,089
He will display miracles.

878
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,067
Amen!

879
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:28,622
The police order

880
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,739
states to skin you alive.

881
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,258
Do you want to try?

882
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,982
Sir, it's not our mistake.

883
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:33,045
The Police can question if we

884
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,287
parked under the
no parking zone.

885
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:35,118
If we parked on the balcony,

886
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:35,926
only the owner could question.

887
00:41:36,106 --> 00:41:36,973
He can't question us.

888
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:38,184
Hey, what's wrong with you?

889
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:39,279
You plan to get me

890
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,497
whacked by the Police.

891
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:41,552
You're right!
Shut up!

892
00:41:41,577 --> 00:41:42,266
Okay, Boss.

893
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:43,915
We have no clue about it.

894
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,884
Even if we floor it, our car

895
00:41:44,896 --> 00:41:45,730
does not exceed 40 km/hour.

896
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:46,592
I swear I don't know

897
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,529
how it went up 40 feet.

898
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:49,254
Who was driving?
Him!

899
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:50,373
Sir, not me.
He was driving.

900
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:52,435
Sir, not me. It was him.

901
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:53,628
Really? Did I drive?

902
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:55,668
You were
intoxicated to the level

903
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,231
that no one remembers who drove.

904
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,919
Sir, I agree we were drunk.

905
00:41:59,009 --> 00:41:59,931
But we don't know how

906
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:01,055
it went up the balcony.

907
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,222
I'll book you all under

908
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:03,256
a drunken drive case.

909
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:04,258
Sir, please don't file a case.

910
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,474
Aren't the Police
public's friends?

911
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,365
License is to
drive on the road.

912
00:42:06,377 --> 00:42:07,090
Let's come to an agreement.

913
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:08,256
Spare this one last time

914
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:09,051
Sir, why should we agree?

915
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:10,810
Why don't you run a

916
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,130
test only on drunk people?

917
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,458
And just arrest them.

918
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,565
Go ahead. Blow!

919
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:16,588
He's not drunk.

920
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:18,072
Toothpaste ad, is it?

921
00:42:18,084 --> 00:42:19,302
Where are you going?

922
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:20,141
Blow it properly.

923
00:42:20,153 --> 00:42:21,232
It won't be respectable!

924
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:22,146
Sir, he's hiding a bottle

925
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:23,075
inside his second pocket.

926
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:24,001
Sir, it's not mine. It

927
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:24,681
belongs to my Boss.

928
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:25,901
I knew it!

929
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,078
In this project, thermal energy

930
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,692
can used without any loss.

931
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:40,734
Akash, mix it right. If not,

932
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:42,107
it will become flammable.

933
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,834
Hey, I'm trying to do the same.

934
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:51,084
Hi!
Hi!

935
00:42:51,124 --> 00:42:52,425
Welcome to the Alien world.

936
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:52,854
Thank you.

937
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:54,089
My name is Tattoo.

938
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,473
I'm an alien!

939
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:57,291
I come from a

940
00:42:57,303 --> 00:42:59,654
planet far, far away.

941
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,888
Far, far, away, you say.
Yes!

942
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:02,959
I wonder how much he spent and

943
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,288
how many toll booths
he had to cross.

944
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:05,607
What kind of name is Tattoo?

945
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:06,929
I'm green in colour.

946
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:08,789
And I easily mix with people.

947
00:43:08,938 --> 00:43:10,256
Thus, my name is Tattoo.

948
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:12,186
Oh! Sorry

949
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:13,332
I'm going to tell you about

950
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,776
exciting things about my planet.

951
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:16,860
Three hundred moons

952
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:18,506
surround my planet.

953
00:43:18,735 --> 00:43:20,271
The gravity on my planet

954
00:43:20,283 --> 00:43:22,217
is lower than that on Earth.

955
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:23,151
Maybe she found out that

956
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:24,173
it was me from last night.

957
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,726
That's why she has

958
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:26,655
followed me here.

959
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:30,874
Hey! Hey! Hey!

960
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:32,976
Oh, no!

961
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:37,067
Let go!

962
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:39,951
Please put me down!

963
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:43,803
What are you doing?

964
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,958
I asked you to put me down.

965
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:52,944
As you asked, I put you down.

966
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:54,906
Oh, no!

967
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:55,899
Hey! It was you

968
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:57,106
from last night...

969
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,903
I ought to!
Listen...

970
00:43:59,695 --> 00:44:00,985
I saved you from falling on the

971
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:02,341
floor and breaking your bones.

972
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,463
Instead of thanking me

973
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,851
for it. You're yelling at me.

974
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,078
I need to choose a different

975
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:06,950
technique to handle you.

976
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:09,710
Security! Security!
Oh, no!

977
00:44:09,735 --> 00:44:11,385
She keeps calling security.

978
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:12,109
Security!

979
00:44:12,702 --> 00:44:13,280
Sec

980
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:23,367
Hey!
Now, do you remember me?

981
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:25,413
You're from Poombarai, right?

982
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:26,062
Yes!

983
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:27,629
I came to talk to you because

984
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:28,944
I met you back in Poombarai.

985
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:30,405
But after meeting you, I felt

986
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,824
your heart was made of stone.

987
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:32,856
Okay!

988
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:33,779
Why apologize

989
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:34,812
after pissing me off?

990
00:44:34,887 --> 00:44:36,015
When did I even apologize?

991
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:37,800
Oh, you didn't?

992
00:44:38,016 --> 00:44:39,461
Maybe you'd want to apologize.

993
00:44:39,647 --> 00:44:40,632
When you do...

994
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:42,369
Please come to this

995
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:43,257
address and apologize.

996
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,678
What is a "Surprise Management?"

997
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,577
It's a surprise
I won't tell you.

998
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:48,303
Bye!

999
00:44:48,328 --> 00:44:48,881
This is a school

1000
00:44:48,893 --> 00:44:49,565
students' project.

1001
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:51,060
They're from Govt. School, sir.

1002
00:44:51,072 --> 00:44:51,513
Hello!

1003
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,442
What is your project about?

1004
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:55,036
This is a sewage

1005
00:44:55,048 --> 00:44:56,921
water distillation project.

1006
00:44:57,116 --> 00:44:59,608
It's a fourstage process.

1007
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:00,809
First, it begins from

1008
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:01,660
the sewage river.

1009
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,023
Then, it passes

1010
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,238
through a water tank.

1011
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:12,217
It's okay. Do you want

1012
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:13,389
water? Are you okay?

1013
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:14,977
So, this child has

1014
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:15,929
created this project.

1015
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:17,076
It's basically a sewage

1016
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:18,241
water treatment plant.

1017
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:19,366
Are you okay?

1018
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,210
What it does is...

1019
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:23,313
distillates the sewage

1020
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:25,154
water at a cheaper cost.

1021
00:45:25,248 --> 00:45:26,073
This girl has created

1022
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:26,763
a model project.

1023
00:45:29,906 --> 00:45:31,183
Take the kids and
move to the other side.

1024
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:31,705
Kids move fast!

1025
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:33,830
Run! Run!
This way! This way!

1026
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:36,668
Run to that side.

1027
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,178
Come, come, come.

1028
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:39,252
This way. Hurry up!

1029
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,562
Oh, no!

1030
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:14,434
Don't be afraid.

1031
00:46:14,446 --> 00:46:15,367
Come on, let's go!

1032
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:19,943
Give her to me.

1033
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:26,460
Who saved all the kids?

1034
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:29,147
Please open the door.

1035
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:30,310
Please hold her.

1036
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:06,984
Son, don't be afraid.

1037
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:13,574
Where's my mother?

1038
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,646
Where's the ambulance?

1039
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:16,303
Wait! Wait! Come!

1040
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:20,778
Take him away.

1041
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:23,998
Please follow the ambulance.

1042
00:47:24,195 --> 00:47:25,085
What is the name of the student?

1043
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:32,505
Hey, son...

1044
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,146
What name did he say it was?

1045
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:35,830
Tattoo, in ten minutes,

1046
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:37,176
we'll reach the hospital.

1047
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:39,184
There's nothing wrong with me.

1048
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,478
Don't be afraid; they won't give

1049
00:47:40,503 --> 00:47:41,831
you an injection, just medicine.

1050
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:44,171
Your medicine won't work on me.

1051
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:45,153
I will be fine if I go

1052
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:45,997
inside my spaceship.

1053
00:47:46,184 --> 00:47:46,610
Because I'm an

1054
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:47,374
extraterrestrial being.

1055
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:48,780
You already mentioned it.

1056
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:49,822
I'm a Superman. I can

1057
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:51,308
make people fly in the air.

1058
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:52,283
I thought human beings

1059
00:47:52,295 --> 00:47:53,125
were irresponsible.

1060
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,329
But their brains are half fried.

1061
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:55,696
Oh, God! You're too

1062
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,336
much into your character.

1063
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,538
Hey, son!

1064
00:48:01,116 --> 00:48:02,654
Where are you? Did you fall?

1065
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:03,552
Don't look for me in

1066
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:04,372
vain. I'm right here!

1067
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,608
Here, as in where?

1068
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,393
It's not the time to

1069
00:48:06,418 --> 00:48:07,067
play hide and seek.

1070
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:08,145
I'm not a Gameboy,

1071
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:09,036
but a nice boy.

1072
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:12,975
Hi!

1073
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,093
Don't scream; I don't like it.

1074
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:16,858
There's an oncoming

1075
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,428
truck. Swerve!

1076
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,370
Don't swerve too much!

1077
00:48:30,602 --> 00:48:31,264
Instead of driving,

1078
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:31,844
you're singing.

1079
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:41,078
Hear me out! Don't scream.

1080
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,836
You're completely fine.

1081
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:43,571
Where are you

1082
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,930
going? Don't be afraid.

1083
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:46,312
Why are you running?

1084
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:51,305
Hello!

1085
00:48:52,784 --> 00:48:53,508
You're running where

1086
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,367
the river should have.

1087
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:55,234
Stop! Don't run.

1088
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:56,664
Dear Lord. Please save me.

1089
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:57,781
Save me!

1090
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:09,390
Lie down, lie down. Don't worry.

1091
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:10,693
Who are you?

1092
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,230
I'm a living being

1093
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,213
just like you are.

1094
00:49:13,346 --> 00:49:14,737
But I'm not from this planet.

1095
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:20,369
Hey! You...

1096
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:21,571
So, you're an alien.

1097
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,893
Are you going to kill me?

1098
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:23,716
Please don't call

1099
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:24,337
me by that name.

1100
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:25,427
I don't like it.

1101
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,654
Do you expect me

1102
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:27,974
to give you a name?

1103
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,539
Don't aliens usually

1104
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,899
invade America?

1105
00:49:32,237 --> 00:49:33,114
Why did you arrive

1106
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:33,856
in our country?

1107
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:34,951
We don't have to

1108
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:35,867
destroy your country.

1109
00:49:36,033 --> 00:49:36,694
I can see that you people are

1110
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:37,564
good enough to
destroy it yourself.

1111
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:38,534
Like the locusts

1112
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:39,455
destroyed your farm.

1113
00:49:41,206 --> 00:49:42,267
I know... that you're

1114
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,352
a good living being.

1115
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,555
That's why I'm
still talking to you.

1116
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:45,142
What did you say?

1117
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:46,434
Living being?
Of course!

1118
00:49:47,103 --> 00:49:47,711
You're referring to me

1119
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:48,553
as if I'm a pest or insect.

1120
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,294
Bear this in mind.

1121
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,378
I'm a human being.

1122
00:49:50,511 --> 00:49:52,057
I don't believe
anything you say.

1123
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,602
It's best you maintain distance.

1124
00:49:53,644 --> 00:49:54,554
Don't be afraid. I'm

1125
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:55,581
not a threat to you.

1126
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:56,846
Hello, I'm not afraid!

1127
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,229
It's best you leave from here.

1128
00:49:59,526 --> 00:50:01,464
I'll forgive you. Okay?

1129
00:50:03,192 --> 00:50:03,752
Hey...

1130
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:08,966
Hey! Why are you moving the van?

1131
00:50:09,203 --> 00:50:09,974
Monkey!

1132
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:12,678
You don't know me.
I know you!

1133
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:14,424
Oh, you know
everything about me?

1134
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,444
Okay, then, turn around.

1135
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:17,323
And tell me what I'm

1136
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:18,024
writing on the ground.

1137
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:21,152
They asked me not

1138
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:21,859
to trust the humans.

1139
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:22,882
Let me give it a try.

1140
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:35,684
Sparc!

1141
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:00,997
How long was I out?
Two days!

1142
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:03,825
And six hours.

1143
00:51:16,455 --> 00:51:17,972
Sir, we analysed all the

1144
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:19,481
traces from your vault.

1145
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:21,151
It's definitely not an

1146
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:22,329
earthbased life form.

1147
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:25,070
What?
Yes, it's an alien.

1148
00:51:26,118 --> 00:51:26,578
What nonsense are

1149
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,118
you talking about?

1150
00:51:27,276 --> 00:51:28,717
Why would an alien attack me?

1151
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,320
Aryan, it did not

1152
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:31,852
come to attack you.

1153
00:51:32,244 --> 00:51:32,747
Then?

1154
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,606
The Sparc is missing!

1155
00:51:41,907 --> 00:51:43,888
Why did the alien
come to my lab?

1156
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,423
Why did it

1157
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:48,161
specifically target me?

1158
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:56,788
If it did come for the Sparc...

1159
00:51:57,709 --> 00:51:58,991
What is its motive?

1160
00:51:59,777 --> 00:52:01,367
Will it stop this project?

1161
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:02,036
Sir?

1162
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,122
Where is it?

1163
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,351
Since the spaceship is

1164
00:52:23,363 --> 00:52:25,447
invisible, we can't access it.

1165
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:26,585
Did you check if

1166
00:52:26,597 --> 00:52:27,732
the Sparc is inside it?

1167
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:28,912
We tried searching with an

1168
00:52:28,924 --> 00:52:30,042
advanced scanning device.

1169
00:52:30,174 --> 00:52:30,829
No use!

1170
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,894
Break it down! I need the Sparc!

1171
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,192
No, no! Its metal components

1172
00:52:34,204 --> 00:52:35,260
are not of the Earth.

1173
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:36,174
And without knowing

1174
00:52:36,216 --> 00:52:37,398
its safety mechanism...

1175
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:39,297
breaking it could be dangerous.

1176
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:40,518
So, only the alien

1177
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,815
can access it. Right?

1178
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:42,380
Yes, sir!

1179
00:52:42,962 --> 00:52:44,200
We need a ufologist!

1180
00:52:51,016 --> 00:52:52,943
You should've been there. It

1181
00:52:52,955 --> 00:52:55,171
made the van float in the air.

1182
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:57,079
I believe the alien saved

1183
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,396
the kids in the school.

1184
00:52:58,469 --> 00:52:59,576
That means the alien stuck

1185
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:00,751
our car into the balcony.

1186
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,041
You're right. It's the alien!

1187
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:05,068
You spoke to the guys

1188
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,711
from the other state.

1189
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:07,284
And spinning

1190
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:08,120
stories about aliens.

1191
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:09,383
Hey, you expect us to believe

1192
00:53:09,408 --> 00:53:10,528
in your madeup stories?

1193
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:11,005
Hey, shut up!

1194
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,122
Boss, don't be fooled by him.

1195
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:13,346
You should've been caught by it.

1196
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:14,389
I'm finding it hard to

1197
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:15,626
believe your locust story.

1198
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:17,393
Aliens are not our genre!

1199
00:53:17,472 --> 00:53:18,272
Do you mean to say there's

1200
00:53:18,284 --> 00:53:19,159
no such thing as an alien?

1201
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,189
Do you believe they exist?

1202
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:21,503
Like the fake Godmen

1203
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:23,346
who spins horror stories...

1204
00:53:23,448 --> 00:53:24,251
do a few scientists

1205
00:53:24,263 --> 00:53:25,120
spin alien stories.

1206
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,282
Do you mean to say I'm lying

1207
00:53:26,294 --> 00:53:27,778
about seeing or
talking to an alien?

1208
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:28,792
Are you implying it's true?

1209
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:30,010
Trust me, the
alien spoke to me.

1210
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,703
It is this tall.

1211
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,018
And it was green in colour.

1212
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:35,296
It had big eyes like this man.

1213
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:36,934
Boss, I did meet

1214
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:38,369
an alien. Trust me!

1215
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,805
Boss, he identified

1216
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,046
that you're a fool.

1217
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:42,440
That is why he
keeps mocking you.

1218
00:53:42,642 --> 00:53:43,892
Hey, stop with your nonsense.

1219
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:46,782
Boss, why would I lie?

1220
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:50,694
Why am I sweating
after a shower?

1221
00:53:52,455 --> 00:53:53,503
Idiotic Boss left his

1222
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:54,777
perfume open after use.

1223

[sings a Tamil song]

1224
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:03,401
Boss! Alien!

1225
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,358
Hey, come save me!

1226
00:54:04,596 --> 00:54:05,787
Boss, it's the alien!

1227
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:06,715
Come over here!

1228
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:08,587
Boss! Alien!

1229
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,837
Hey, enough with the alien rant.

1230
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:12,179
It's not me. It's him

1231
00:54:12,191 --> 00:54:13,519
who is mocking you.

1232
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:15,330
Save me!
I ought to, Tysa!

1233
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:17,045
Oh, no!

1234
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,931
Hi!

1235
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:32,518
Kuttima, when did you arrive?

1236
00:54:33,056 --> 00:54:34,291
I left the gas on.

1237
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:35,282
Play with uncle.

1238
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:36,889
I don't know how to play.

1239
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,187
Hey, Tyson,
catch and tie it up.

1240
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,406
Oh, no, what's happening?

1241
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:41,653
Hold his leg. Hey,

1242

catch and tie it up.

1243

I set a mouse trap.

1244
00:54:45,135 --> 00:54:46,701
But an alien is trapped.

1245
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,682
Hey, don't sit ducks.

1246
00:54:47,694 --> 00:54:48,651
Get up and catch it.

1247
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:49,311
I'm not the Boss.

1248
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:50,135
It's him! Catch him!

1249
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,312
Tie him up. He's breaking

1250
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:52,221
everything around.

1251
00:54:52,246 --> 00:54:52,736
Tie him up!

1252
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,127
Tysa, it's coming towards you.

1253
00:54:54,212 --> 00:54:55,018
Do something!

1254
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,315
Tysa, do something!

1255
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:56,916
Boss!

1256
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:01,963
Die! Don't mess with me.

1257
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:10,022
Oh, no, they killed him.

1258
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:21,148
It's still breathing.

1259
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:36,431
Hey, keep a lookout.

1260
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:38,618
Hey, is it a male or female?

1261
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:39,649
I'll check and let

1262
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:40,542
you know. Get lost!

1263
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,244
Be calm and watch
me speak to him.

1264
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:42,929
It's a female.

1265
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:52,577
I don't know.

1266

[In Hindi] What's your name?

1267
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:54,509
What are you saying?

1268
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:55,960
I don't understand.

1269
00:55:56,343 --> 00:55:58,044
You don't get it?
Now watch me.

1270
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:03,375
[In Kannada] What's your name?

1271
00:56:03,387 --> 00:56:04,307
To hell with you.

1272
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,490
Can't you see it can speak

1273
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:06,630
in Tamil? Stop showing off.

1274
00:56:06,734 --> 00:56:07,624
You're right.

1275
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:09,148
It is speaking in Tamil.

1276
00:56:09,196 --> 00:56:10,134
I did tell you that it

1277
00:56:10,169 --> 00:56:11,422
speaks way better than you.

1278
00:56:11,485 --> 00:56:12,653
You don't say! Let's see!

1279
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,619
Hey, Alien!

1280
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:16,065
Who are you calling an alien?

1281
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:17,135
You're an alien. Your father is

1282
00:56:17,147 --> 00:56:18,217
an alien, and so is your mother.

1283
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:19,719
If you dare call me an alien

1284

again, I'll become human.

Shall we clash headon?

1287
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:27,088
It's atrocious Boss.
Let it go!

1288
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,205
Fine, tell me your purpose

1289
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:29,320
for visiting the planet Earth.

1290
00:56:29,475 --> 00:56:30,670
To sightsee the planet Earth.

explore different countries.

If I whack you, you'll be down!

1294
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,416
Why are you following us

1295
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,322
instead of
sightseeing in the city?

1296
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:41,685
I found out, Boss.

1297
00:56:41,697 --> 00:56:42,797
You see, the matter is...

1298
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:44,155
it's his lover's birthday.

1299

He's here to second prize...

1300

It's a surprise!

He's here to surprise her.

1302
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:49,237
As you expect,

1303
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:50,250
we don't have balloons that

1304
00:56:50,302 --> 00:56:51,421
could fly so high in the sky.

Let alone we fly it. We

1306

And you're explaining.

1310
00:56:57,336 --> 00:56:58,007
It wants to say

something. Let's hear it out.

What is it?

arrived in is missing.

1315
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:03,293

Its vehicle is missing.

Is the vehicle missing?

Did you put a side lock on it?

No!

1321
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:10,166
I hid it at a site.

1322
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,136
What's the use?

1323
00:57:11,148 --> 00:57:12,554
Anyway, they stole it.

Why can't you be responsible?

1336
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:33,195
You're here because

1337

you have nowhere to go.

afraid of me anymore.

Oh, God, you're too much!

1342
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:41,084
Afraid, it seems.

1343

Okay.

ring from the neighbours?

1356
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,229
What is it?
What is he saying?

guys to hide me.

A girl, you say?

1361
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:42,956
Boss, bring me something.

1362
00:58:42,968 --> 00:58:43,729
Let's hide him.

1363

Hey, bring me the tshirt.

1364

00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:47,735
causing us humiliation.

1368
00:58:48,968 --> 00:58:49,561
Welcome!

1369
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:51,189
Listen, my boys mixed up the

1370
00:58:51,201 --> 00:58:52,318
names and surprised
you by mistake.

1371
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:53,633
I know it, uncle.

1372
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:54,778
I'm not here for that.

1373
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:56,723
I wanted to meet him...

1374
00:58:57,044 --> 00:58:58,032
Uncle, please step aside.

1375
00:58:58,044 --> 00:58:58,698
Uncle, please.

1376
00:58:58,963 --> 00:58:59,589
Please tell me.

1377
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:00,720
Did you check Facebook?

1378
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:02,075
I did not recharge

1379
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:03,447
yet. What's the matter?

1380
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,323
See, you're the
talk of the town.

1381
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:10,156
Umm... I'm really sorry.

1382
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,526
I thought you were in love

1383
00:59:12,538 --> 00:59:14,604
with me and yelled at you.

1384
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,296
It's common to yell and make up.

1385
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:17,943
What?

1386
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,742
I meant it as a joke.
Oh!

1387
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,421
But thanks a lot.

1388
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,908
If not for you, it

1389
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,195
would've been a disaster.

1390
00:59:26,702 --> 00:59:27,264
Thank you.

1391
00:59:31,725 --> 00:59:32,934
Please don't mention it.

1392
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:35,690
It was my duty.
Wow! Nice.

1393
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:37,310
Why are you standing

1394
00:59:37,322 --> 00:59:38,492
outside? Please come in.

1395
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,038
Yeah? Okay!

1396
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:40,715
Step aside. Go

1397
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:41,792
and get us rose milk.

1398
00:59:41,883 --> 00:59:42,438
Rose milk?

1399
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,049
Why did they both go inside?

1400
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,174
Of course. I did warn

1401
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,292
you when he arrived.

1402
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:47,173
That he's in the

1403
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:48,189
city to impress a girl.

1404
00:59:48,554 --> 00:59:49,393
You never listened!

1405
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:50,625
Take your hands off the lamp.

1406
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:51,737
It's giving a wrong impression.

1407
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:04,844
" You take pieces of my heart "

1408
01:00:05,071 --> 01:00:08,000
" String them into flowers "

1409
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:12,078
" You intoxicate

1410
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:16,409
my brain slowly "

1411
01:00:16,661 --> 01:00:20,144
" My beloved brat Smoothly

1412
01:00:20,156 --> 01:00:23,651
smashing into my heart "

1413
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:27,889
" The wind slants "

1414
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:32,037
" My time swings "

1415
01:00:33,302 --> 01:00:38,250
" You take pieces of my heart "

1416
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:41,086
" String them into flowers "

1417
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:56,039
I'll call you back. Bye!

1418
01:00:57,757 --> 01:00:59,798
I'm happy to meet all of you.

1419
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:01,718
I like your house a lot.

1420
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:03,016
Consider it as your own house.

1421
01:01:03,089 --> 01:01:04,256
You're welcome anytime.

1422
01:01:04,468 --> 01:01:05,671
Okay, sure. Bye!

1423
01:01:06,242 --> 01:01:06,723
Bye!

1424
01:01:09,383 --> 01:01:10,726
Sorry! Thank you.

1425
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:18,747
Tara!

1426
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:30,622
Hey!

1427
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,546
You're awesome!

1428
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,507
I will help you

1429
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:35,226
find your vehicle.

1430
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,132
You can stay here.

1431
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:38,351
Thanks for respecting

1432
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:40,063
my word and let him stay.

1433
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:41,829
Brother, you may leave.

1434
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:43,396
Instead of you, I will extract

1435
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,436
the hard work from him.

1436
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:45,013
Boss, why would

1437
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:45,786
you ask me to leave?

1438
01:01:45,814 --> 01:01:46,897
Hey, our Boss does not

1439
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:48,202
go back on his decision.

1440
01:01:48,306 --> 01:01:49,493
Boss, how can he speak for you?

1441
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:50,727
Shall I ask him to speak?
Hey!

1442
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:52,098
I can't live without you, Boss!

1443
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:52,827
Don't sass me!

1444
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:54,522
Boss, he's overdoing it.

1445
01:01:54,561 --> 01:01:55,045
Please, Boss!

1446
01:01:55,057 --> 01:01:55,944
I've made my decision.

1447
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:58,428
Boss, you smiled.
Did he smile?

1448
01:01:58,522 --> 01:01:59,114
Boss smiled!

1449
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:00,149
Fine, you can stay.

1450
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:01,561
We're back together.
Shameless!

1451
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:03,123
You, too, go and

1452
01:02:03,135 --> 01:02:04,874
bring your family.

1453
01:02:05,032 --> 01:02:06,579
What? What's with the glaring?

1454
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:08,341
Hey, no one has ever

1455
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:09,997
looked at me for so long.

1456
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:11,170
Do you like me a lot?

1457
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:17,509
He's overdoing it.

1458
01:02:18,896 --> 01:02:19,651
" Alien "

1459
01:02:20,764 --> 01:02:21,411
" You, alien! "

1460
01:02:22,227 --> 01:02:22,566
Oh, no!

1461
01:02:22,578 --> 01:02:23,631
Why did you not fill petrol?

1462
01:02:23,728 --> 01:02:24,720
I bought fritters instead.

1463
01:02:24,732 --> 01:02:25,178
Hopeless!

1464
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,371
Did you eat the fritters, too?

1465
01:02:26,383 --> 01:02:27,484
I don't know what
to do about you.

1466
01:02:28,421 --> 01:02:29,262
" You, alien! "

1467
01:02:30,296 --> 01:02:31,100
" Alien "

1468
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:33,091
" You, alien! "

1469
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:34,600
" Alien "

1470
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:36,778
" You, alien! "

1471
01:02:37,911 --> 01:02:38,567
" Alien "

1472
01:02:39,795 --> 01:02:40,396
" Alien "

1473
01:02:48,718 --> 01:02:50,055
How did you catch it?

1474
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:51,170
It weighs less.

1475
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:52,548
This one is okay.

1476
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:53,808
I'll use butter to

1477
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,900
make starters out of it.

1478
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,454
Okay?
Give it to me.

1479
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:57,735
Take it. Peel it

1480
01:02:57,797 --> 01:02:58,767
Hey, what are you doing?

1481
01:02:58,779 --> 01:02:59,251
Fly away!

1482
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:03,718
Do you have corona too?

1483
01:03:05,963 --> 01:03:06,817
What? That's isn't

1484
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:08,223
enough. Let it inhale more.

1485
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:10,081
" He crossed the Saturn's ring

1486
01:03:10,093 --> 01:03:12,014

1487
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,877
" Trying to cross over our

01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:17,591
" He went around our place

1490
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:19,572
And got drenched by the sweat "

1491
01:03:19,736 --> 01:03:21,189
" He doubts if it is

1492
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:23,032
the Earth or the sun. "

1493
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:23,901
Stop right there.

1494
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:25,651
" He tried counting

1495
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:27,197
the population "

1496
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:28,754
" And could not find a

" Hey, alien! "

1506
01:04:01,736 --> 01:04:02,735
What is it?

1507
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:05,262
This is a rubber doll I

1508
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,393
bought at the beach.

1509
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:08,172
It's not the age

1510
01:04:08,184 --> 01:04:09,199
to play with dolls.

Sir, my brother

" See, you are one among us "

1537
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:11,811
" We will create a

1538
01:05:11,823 --> 01:05:13,934
DP for you in Twitter "

1539
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:15,466
" You can become a trend

1540
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,230
By posting a social message "

1541
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:19,065
" My life has become beautiful

1542
01:05:19,077 --> 01:05:20,996
and colourful because of you "

1543
01:05:21,128 --> 01:05:22,384
" Hey alien, are you

1544
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:23,982
a naughty little boy? "

1545
01:05:24,939 --> 01:05:26,238
" When there are

1546
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,725
so many planets "

1547
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:29,579
" Why did you jump

1548
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:31,667
here from the sky? "

1549
01:05:32,425 --> 01:05:35,041
" No other planet has a

1550
01:05:35,053 --> 01:05:39,394
language like our
Tamil, they say! "

1551
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,493
" Alien "

1552
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:43,306
" You, alien "

1553
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:45,387
" Alien "

1554
01:05:48,441 --> 01:05:49,128
" Alien "

1555
01:05:52,231 --> 01:05:52,993
" Alien "

1556
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,026
There's a man in America

1557
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:48,250
who suits our criteria.

1558
01:06:48,883 --> 01:06:51,255
His name is Dexter Williams.

1559
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,865
In the 90s, he wrote a book

1560
01:06:52,877 --> 01:06:54,406
on aliens and became famous.

1561
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:55,648
After a few years...

1562
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:57,251
when he told people he spotted

1563
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,867
a UFO, but no one believed him.

1564
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,162
But the truth is he

1565
01:07:00,174 --> 01:07:01,083
did see the aliens.

1566
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,319
Rumour has it that the US

1567
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:03,669
government is hiding the truth.

1568
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:04,650
Even today, he's madly

1569
01:07:04,662 --> 01:07:05,825
venturing into restricted zones

1570
01:07:05,881 --> 01:07:06,748
to prove he was

1571
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,874
telling the truth.

1572
01:07:28,193 --> 01:07:30,405
Now, this...

1573
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:32,694
is advanced technology.

1574
01:07:33,622 --> 01:07:34,231
You know...

1575
01:07:34,419 --> 01:07:35,799
to achieve this, it would

1576
01:07:35,811 --> 01:07:37,202
take hundreds of years.

1577
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:41,876
We must find out the reason

1578
01:07:41,888 --> 01:07:44,405
why did the alien
try to attack you?

1579
01:07:44,802 --> 01:07:46,044
That's not a big deal now.

1580
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:48,693
I must know where the Sparc is.

1581
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:49,458
Oh...

1582
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,513
Now I get it. You attacked it.

1583
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,888
That's why it escaped!

1584
01:07:58,848 --> 01:08:00,634
Umm... I reckon we don't get a

1585
01:08:00,646 --> 01:08:02,624
signal inside the Faraday cage.

1586
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:04,991
Yes, no kind of wave will work.

1587
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:06,206
If that is the case...

1588
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:09,192
this alien can't escape from it.

1589
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:10,435
It must be
somewhere in the city.

1590
01:08:10,903 --> 01:08:11,947
No matter where it's hiding

1591
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,216
in this world, we must catch it.

1592
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:15,848
I want my Sparc back.

1593
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:17,465
We can capture it with

1594
01:08:17,477 --> 01:08:18,699
the equipment I have.

1595
01:08:19,497 --> 01:08:20,446
But you have

1596
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:22,621
underestimated this alien.

1597
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:23,691
From the incidents that

1598
01:08:23,703 --> 01:08:24,801
occurred in your office...

1599
01:08:25,176 --> 01:08:26,587
this alien has

1600
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:28,835
extraordinary powers!

1601
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:42,255
Hey!

1602
01:08:44,864 --> 01:08:46,302
Boss! Boss!

1603
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:49,398
What happened?

1604
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:52,232
What is He doing

1605
01:08:52,244 --> 01:08:53,137
with the machine?

1606
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,332
Hey! He has contacted

1607
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:55,364
his mother planet.

1608
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,325
Contacted?

1609
01:08:57,849 --> 01:08:59,060
Boss, weren't you looking

1610
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:00,491
for a pan to roast mustard?

1611
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:01,804
-Look, there's one here.
-Hey!

1612
01:09:01,873 --> 01:09:02,460
Eh? What?

1613
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:03,751
He's doing research, and

1614
01:09:03,763 --> 01:09:04,771
you're being irresponsible.

1615
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:05,458
Shut up and watch.

1616
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:10,759
[Mallipoo - Vendhu

1617
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,613
Thanindhathu Kaadu]

1618
01:09:15,535 --> 01:09:16,634
Is it a technical fault?

1619
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,184
Brat! Brat!

1620
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:20,413
Get up.
Go and make us some tea.

1621
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:21,471
The lyrics were good.

1622
01:09:21,483 --> 01:09:23,090
One day, I'm
going to whack you.

1623
01:09:23,135 --> 01:09:24,733
On that day, you
won't be there.

1624
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:25,929
He has a plan in place!

1625
01:09:26,551 --> 01:09:27,136
Hello!

1626
01:09:28,573 --> 01:09:29,052
Tara!

1627
01:09:33,509 --> 01:09:36,461
No one but me possesses an

1628
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,892
advanced device in the world

1629
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,684
that is specifically

1630
01:09:40,696 --> 01:09:41,741
designed to research aliens.

1631
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:44,720
This device will
find entities or living

1632
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:46,812
beings that are
irrelevant to our planet

1633
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:47,673
and transmits an

1634
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:48,819
instant signal to me.

1635
01:10:01,174 --> 01:10:01,677
Careful!

1636
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:07,559
Listen, pay up to 500 rupees.

1637
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:09,408
I was told it's a free service.

1638
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:10,091
The ambulance is

1639
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:10,942
free. But we drove it.

1640
01:10:11,104 --> 01:10:11,791
Give us 500 rupees.

1641
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,416
I brought my child
back home because

1642
01:10:13,428 --> 01:10:14,996
I could not spend
on medical bills.

1643
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:16,000
If you rob us in broad

1644
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:17,252
daylight, what would we do?

1645
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,022
Annoying lady!

1646
01:10:19,179 --> 01:10:20,256
I'll play with you

1647
01:10:20,268 --> 01:10:21,780
only if you let me bat.

1648
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,569
Sure, you can bat.

1649
01:10:24,025 --> 01:10:25,221
Advanced stage!

1650
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,933
The doctors tried every

1651
01:10:26,945 --> 01:10:28,002
treatment possible.

1652
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:29,536
The doctor advised that her

1653
01:10:29,548 --> 01:10:31,348
body couldn't take chemotherapy.

1654
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,481
The book you bought for me...

1655
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,552
I don't know if I

1656
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:37,798
can complete it.

1657
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,145
You must not lose hope.

1658
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,793
I wish I could die without pain.

1659
01:10:44,332 --> 01:10:45,394
Nothing will happen to you.

1660
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:47,551
You're a good girl.

1661
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,418
Close your eyes and take a rest.

1662
01:10:51,056 --> 01:10:51,899
You will be fine.

1663
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:55,180
Hey, what are you

1664
01:10:55,192 --> 01:10:56,629
doing? They might see you.

1665
01:10:58,705 --> 01:11:00,439
Hey, Tattoo, be quiet.

1666
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:03,978
Hey... Tamizh...

1667
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:06,336
What are you doing?

1668
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:10,619
Tamizh, what are you doing?

1669
01:11:18,947 --> 01:11:19,481
Please tell me,

1670
01:11:19,493 --> 01:11:20,220
what are you doing?

1671
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:24,855
Tamizh, I'm talking to

1672
01:11:24,867 --> 01:11:25,715
you. What are you doing?

1673
01:11:41,781 --> 01:11:42,941
Ma, I don't have

1674
01:11:42,953 --> 01:11:44,271
the pain anymore.

1675
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:57,954
I feel normal again.

1676
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,611
I don't have pain.

1677
01:12:04,726 --> 01:12:06,140
We should not be here. Let's go!

1678
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:07,774
-Let's go!
-Hey!

1679
01:12:09,307 --> 01:12:09,806
Tamizh!

1680
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:10,926
They're on to us. Start

1681
01:12:10,938 --> 01:12:12,059
the vehicle. Hurry up!

1682
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:19,856
I don't understand

1683
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:20,618
what's happening.

1684
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,696
How did you cure her?

1685
01:12:23,227 --> 01:12:24,254
What's happening? Why

1686
01:12:24,266 --> 01:12:25,684
are these drones chasing us?

1687
01:12:29,657 --> 01:12:30,980
Come to Papa!

1688
01:12:32,617 --> 01:12:33,755
Who is chasing you?

1689
01:12:33,784 --> 01:12:34,704
I'll explain!

1690
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:35,813
Please be quiet for a while.

1691
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:36,536
Tell me, what's happening?

1692
01:12:36,573 --> 01:12:37,164
I know they'll come

1693
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:37,684
looking for me.

1694
01:12:40,634 --> 01:12:42,399
Oh! Ohhh!

1695
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:43,892
Who is coming? And for what?

1696
01:12:44,984 --> 01:12:46,320
Who are you talking to?

1697
01:12:46,746 --> 01:12:47,601
Are you going to tell me

1698
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,625
what's happening out here?

1699
01:12:48,681 --> 01:12:49,399
Are you going to tell me

1700
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:50,262
what's happening out here?

1701
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:51,035
Oh, God!

1702
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:56,366
The alien is inside this van.

1703
01:12:57,345 --> 01:12:58,133
Good job!

1704
01:12:58,243 --> 01:12:59,348
Tell me what's happening?

1705
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,691
Other than us, who is here--

1706
01:13:11,633 --> 01:13:13,655
Wow! Did you see that?

1707
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:15,758
That alien must not

1708
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,132
escape at any cost.

1709
01:13:18,048 --> 01:13:19,446
You still don't get the alien.

1710
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,286
Your ideas won't work on him.

1711
01:13:21,555 --> 01:13:22,302
What's your idea?

1712
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:26,478
Poison!

1713
01:13:27,306 --> 01:13:28,685
You're not aware
of the concentrated

1714
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:29,863
poison we poured on the alien.

1715
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:30,669
You idiot!

1716
01:13:47,992 --> 01:13:49,387
I'm not here to kill the alien.

1717
01:13:49,937 --> 01:13:51,272
I'm here to capture it.

1718
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:53,946
Take him to the place

1719
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,216
where the alien is.

1720
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:56,122
We don't have to

1721
01:13:56,134 --> 01:13:57,106
go looking for him.

1722
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,012
We will make him come to us.

1723
01:13:59,024 --> 01:13:59,575
How?

1724
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,128
Like how Sparc is important

1725
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,918
to you is spaceship
to the alien.

1726
01:14:03,011 --> 01:14:04,958
I'm sure it's looking for it.

1727
01:14:05,558 --> 01:14:07,072
If we bring out the spaceship

1728
01:14:07,084 --> 01:14:08,558
out of the Faraday cage...

1729
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:09,206
the alien will

1730
01:14:09,218 --> 01:14:10,066
come looking for it.

1731
01:14:18,192 --> 01:14:19,432
Hey, who are these people?

1732
01:14:19,444 --> 01:14:20,840
And why are they after you?

1733
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:21,856
I'm not here to

1734
01:14:21,868 --> 01:14:22,957
sight-see the Earth.

1735
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,268
The human race has

1736
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,684
no other business.

1737
01:14:45,035 --> 01:14:46,948
But to find ways
for destruction.

1738
01:14:47,622 --> 01:14:48,807
It's not enough that they

1739
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:50,208
were digging the surface...

1740
01:14:50,247 --> 01:14:50,650
now, they are

1741
01:14:50,662 --> 01:14:51,364
approaching the core.

1742
01:14:51,684 --> 01:14:52,783
The poisonous gases in

1743
01:14:52,795 --> 01:14:54,058
the core are dangerous.

1744
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:55,997
If it gets out, it will destroy

1745
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:57,247
the entire ecosystem.

1746
01:14:57,472 --> 01:14:57,882
Not even an

1747
01:14:57,894 --> 01:14:58,815
insect will survive it.

1748
01:14:59,309 --> 01:15:00,177
Approaching the core?

1749
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:01,956
How could humans achieve such

1750
01:15:01,968 --> 01:15:03,862
depth with the
technology they possess?

1751
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:05,403
It's impossible!

1752
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:06,816
Why do we have
to worry about it?

1753
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:08,184
Anyway, they'll destroy

1754
01:15:08,196 --> 01:15:09,715
the Earth then themselves.

1755
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:10,697
The sooner it happens,

1756
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:11,479
the better for us.

1757
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:13,087
No! The humans may

1758
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:15,316
not care about the Earth.

1759
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:17,105
But we can't be ignorant.

1760
01:15:17,586 --> 01:15:18,300
To keep balance

1761
01:15:18,312 --> 01:15:19,231
in the universe...

1762
01:15:19,493 --> 01:15:20,485
It's crucial that the

1763
01:15:20,497 --> 01:15:21,645
Earth isn't destroyed.

1764
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:23,444
The human race is using a

1765
01:15:23,456 --> 01:15:25,644
technology to
achieve this depth.

1766
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,302
If we fail to save the Earth...

1767
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:28,471
it may pose a

1768
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:29,895
threat to our planet.

1769
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:32,203
We must send one of our own

1770
01:15:32,215 --> 01:15:33,495
to Earth to find out what it is.

1771
01:15:33,564 --> 01:15:34,365
No one from our planet

1772
01:15:34,377 --> 01:15:35,338
is ready to go to Earth.

1773
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:36,661
Who do you have in mind?

1774
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:51,200
This belongs to my planet.

1775
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,103
Due to an explosion, a

1776
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,958
shred of it fell on Earth.

1777
01:15:55,098 --> 01:15:56,168
If they're after us for

1778
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,356
this, let's destroy it.

1779
01:15:57,462 --> 01:15:58,442
It can't be destroyed!

1780
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:00,286
Then bring it back

1781
01:16:00,298 --> 01:16:01,353
to your planet.

1782
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:20,911
Sonic is switching on!

1783
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,853
I know where my spaceship is.

1784
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:36,866
But someone is

1785
01:16:36,878 --> 01:16:37,848
trying to start it.

1786
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:38,882
I must go now!

1787
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:39,716
Hold on a minute.

1788
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:42,175
Suddenly, if there's a signal

1789
01:16:42,187 --> 01:16:43,934
after they start to look for us,

1790
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:45,606
I feel there's something wrong.

1791
01:16:46,182 --> 01:16:47,130
I'm sure there
will be a problem.

1792
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,709
But if I have to complete my

1793
01:16:48,721 --> 01:16:50,228
mission, I need the spaceship.

1794
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,388
Look, it's over there!

1795
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:07,040
-Let's go!
-Hey! Hey!

1796
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:08,486
Wait, I can retrieve the

1797
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,900
spaceship turning invisible.

1798
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:10,772
You may leave!

1799
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:14,033
I cannot forget you.

1800
01:17:14,557 --> 01:17:15,885
You should return soon.

1801
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:17,856
The problems that

1802
01:17:17,868 --> 01:17:18,869
your world creates...

1803
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,791
We may have to visit often.

1804
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:25,026
If everyone is like you,

1805
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:26,524
we do not need to visit.

1806
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:49,886
The alien is inside

1807
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:50,439
the perimeter.

1808
01:17:52,002 --> 01:17:53,630
But it's invisible.

1809
01:19:05,711 --> 01:19:06,853
What the hell are
you doing with it?

1810
01:19:06,865 --> 01:19:07,250
Hey!

1811
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:28,588
Take this!

1812
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,549
Woah! Woah! Woah!

1813
01:19:40,594 --> 01:19:41,242
Yes!

1814
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:46,878
Wow!

1815
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:31,968
What?

1816
01:20:58,791 --> 01:20:59,978
Oh...

1817
01:21:38,262 --> 01:21:39,152
Return home soon

1818
01:21:39,164 --> 01:21:40,291
to me. I love you!

1819
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:01,417
Aryan, it's not safe to

1820
01:24:01,429 --> 01:24:02,640
hold the alien in this facility.

1821
01:24:03,218 --> 01:24:03,855
Better shift it to

1822
01:24:03,867 --> 01:24:04,515
some place safer.

1823
01:24:04,585 --> 01:24:05,421
Just do your job!

1824
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:29,173
Don't worry. It can't move.

1825
01:24:29,336 --> 01:24:30,937
You know this
is really exciting!

1826
01:24:31,431 --> 01:24:33,040
Compared to DNA structures

1827
01:24:33,052 --> 01:24:35,297
of all the species
on the earth...

1828
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:36,985
The DNA structure of the

1829
01:24:36,997 --> 01:24:38,644
alien has been modified.

1830
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:40,013
The humans

1831
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,187
Can I talk to it?
I'm trying!

1832
01:24:43,283 --> 01:24:45,032
We can communicate with it.

1833
01:24:45,257 --> 01:24:46,623
But it's too dangerous

1834
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:48,264
if we keep it conscious.

1835
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:48,966
How long do you

1836
01:24:48,978 --> 01:24:49,953
plan to drag this out?

1837
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:52,513
I need to know about

1838
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:53,624
the Sparc. Do something!

1839
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:54,914
We need more time.

1840
01:24:55,575 --> 01:24:56,726
Due to this, my entire

1841
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:58,059
project will be ruined.

1842
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,596
Where did you come from?

1843
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:03,926
I don't know how to cuss at you.

1844
01:25:04,376 --> 01:25:05,946
Where is my Sparc?

1845
01:25:06,293 --> 01:25:08,712
Do you even know
the value of it?

1846
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:13,121
7,40,304

1847
01:25:14,213 --> 01:25:15,356
The body count of

1848
01:25:15,368 --> 01:25:17,135
living beings you killed.

1849
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:19,174
What? Come again!

1850
01:25:19,597 --> 01:25:21,768
Did it speak now? Did it?

1851
01:25:21,901 --> 01:25:23,110
Yes, sir, it spoke.

1852
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:24,621
What you have in

1853
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:25,923
mind will never work out.

1854
01:25:26,065 --> 01:25:27,430
I will not let it happen!

1855
01:25:28,222 --> 01:25:29,265
Are you going to stop me?

1856
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,650
Press a button, and you'll die!

1857
01:25:32,823 --> 01:25:34,141
I know you're an idiot.

1858
01:25:34,269 --> 01:25:35,501
You believe that killing

1859
01:25:35,513 --> 01:25:37,017
me will solve your problem.

1860
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:37,910
You're not just an

1861
01:25:37,922 --> 01:25:39,237
idiot. But a moronic idiot!

1862
01:25:39,409 --> 01:25:41,121
If I'm dead,
another will arrive.

1863
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:42,515
You're not up

1864
01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:44,198
against me but nature.

1865
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:45,300
I will handle it later.

1866
01:25:45,885 --> 01:25:47,321
But now only you

1867
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,961
are going to die.

1868
01:25:49,207 --> 01:25:50,411
I'm not a human to be

1869
01:25:50,423 --> 01:25:51,871
afraid of your threats.

1870
01:25:52,316 --> 01:25:53,363
Torture it!

1871
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,049
I must know where Sparc is.

1872
01:25:55,555 --> 01:25:56,260
The wounds on

1873
01:25:56,272 --> 01:25:57,958
its body heal itself.

1874
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:58,883
What can we do?

1875
01:26:02,181 --> 01:26:03,766
Can it feel pain?

1876
01:26:04,015 --> 01:26:04,882
Yeah, it can.

1877
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:08,211
Then do it!
No!

1878
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:09,164
Hey!

1879
01:26:16,531 --> 01:26:17,971
Please stop this nonsense.

1880
01:26:18,218 --> 01:26:20,008
It does not fear death.

1881
01:26:20,206 --> 01:26:20,670
If you keep

1882
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:21,722
torturing, it will die.

1883
01:26:22,338 --> 01:26:22,869
Give me

1884
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:25,133
Give me some more time.

1885
01:26:25,244 --> 01:26:26,107
I will speak to it and

1886
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:27,152
find out where Sparc is.

1887
01:26:36,707 --> 01:26:37,350
They have stabbed

1888
01:26:37,362 --> 01:26:38,363
him with a sharp object.

1889
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,522
He was already in a critical

1890
01:26:39,534 --> 01:26:40,775
situation when
he was brought in.

1891
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,315
Let's hope for the best.

1892
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,031
Doctor, please!

1893
01:26:43,524 --> 01:26:44,773
Manage to save him.

1894
01:26:44,823 --> 01:26:45,585
We should not have

1895
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:46,438
taken up the case.

1896
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,069
Since the state of the patient

1897
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:49,396
was dire, we took him in.

1898
01:26:49,618 --> 01:26:50,508
We'll call the Police.

1899
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,501
Doctor, we'll handle the Police.

1900
01:26:52,573 --> 01:26:53,758
Please save him.

1901
01:26:57,321 --> 01:26:57,758
Sir!

1902
01:26:58,321 --> 01:26:59,526
Hey, what are you doing?

1903
01:26:59,538 --> 01:27:00,171
Hey, wait!

1904
01:27:00,378 --> 01:27:01,559
I'm okay, Doctor.

1905
01:27:01,571 --> 01:27:03,295
You're hurt. Calm down!

1906
01:27:04,049 --> 01:27:05,039
I'm okay.

1907
01:27:05,132 --> 01:27:05,912
Sister, hold him down.

1908
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:06,782
Don't panic! Calm down.

1909
01:27:07,338 --> 01:27:09,814
Please hear me out.
I'm okay!

1910
01:27:11,307 --> 01:27:13,381
I'm doing okay.
Oh, God!

1911
01:27:26,523 --> 01:27:27,167
Tysa!

1912
01:27:42,283 --> 01:27:43,034
Do you remember when

1913
01:27:43,046 --> 01:27:44,115
we started this project...

1914
01:27:44,216 --> 01:27:45,231
We told you we needed

1915
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:46,318
more than one Sparc.

1916
01:27:46,441 --> 01:27:47,451
Now we understand...

1917
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:49,928
the only one we
had went missing.

1918
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:51,416
That's not true!

1919
01:27:51,611 --> 01:27:52,607
Sparc is safe.

1920
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:53,962
Then where is it?

1921
01:28:00,652 --> 01:28:02,289
This is my ambitious project.

1922
01:28:02,956 --> 01:28:03,762
To you people, it's

1923
01:28:03,774 --> 01:28:04,636
just an investment.

1924
01:28:04,753 --> 01:28:06,736
In just three days, you'll see.

1925
01:28:07,174 --> 01:28:07,734
Okay.

1926
01:28:08,431 --> 01:28:10,728
But we know you killed Arjun!

1927
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:12,543
So, one person has

1928
01:28:12,568 --> 01:28:14,034
already died for this project.

1929
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,621
So, just be advised...

1930
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,620
Your continued existence...

1931
01:28:17,854 --> 01:28:18,578
depends on the

1932
01:28:18,922 --> 01:28:20,723
success of this project.

1933
01:28:20,957 --> 01:28:21,522
Got it?

1934
01:28:26,432 --> 01:28:27,204
Are you serious?

1935
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:28,244
What happened next?

1936
01:28:28,594 --> 01:28:29,406
Like I mentioned.

1937
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:30,775
Tattoo went to his planet.

1938
01:28:30,893 --> 01:28:31,643
I fought with the people

1939
01:28:31,655 --> 01:28:32,481
who came to capture him.

1940
01:28:32,776 --> 01:28:33,702
They knocked me on my

1941
01:28:33,714 --> 01:28:34,831
head, and I passed out.

1942
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:35,642
Did you see the

1943
01:28:35,654 --> 01:28:36,684
vehicle? How did it look?

1944
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:37,741
It's not a vehicle. It's

1945
01:28:37,753 --> 01:28:38,586
called a spaceship.

1946
01:28:38,878 --> 01:28:40,746
Even I imagined it'd

1947
01:28:40,758 --> 01:28:42,826
be as long as a ship.

1948
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:44,329
But it looked round

1949
01:28:44,341 --> 01:28:45,558
like a doughnut.

1950
01:28:45,676 --> 01:28:48,327
Anyway, Tattoo went home safely.

1951
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,221
I'm happy!

1952
01:28:49,301 --> 01:28:50,040
Except for us, if someone

1953
01:28:50,052 --> 01:28:50,803
else got hold of him...

1954
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:51,455
they would've cut

1955
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:52,326
him open for research.

1956
01:28:52,637 --> 01:28:54,519
Good gracious, I'm a good man.

1957
01:28:54,628 --> 01:28:55,506
Not bad, Boss. You

1958
01:28:55,518 --> 01:28:57,002
praise yourself shamelessly.

1959
01:28:57,285 --> 01:28:57,904
What?

1960
01:28:58,323 --> 01:28:59,443
Boss, watch out for the car.

1961
01:28:59,562 --> 01:29:01,552
Apply brakes! Oh, God!

1962
01:29:06,697 --> 01:29:08,580
Idiot, is this how you drive?

1963
01:29:09,775 --> 01:29:11,345
You look decent yet uneducated.

1964
01:29:11,557 --> 01:29:12,209
Which fool approved

1965
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:12,990
your driving license?

1966
01:29:15,379 --> 01:29:17,613
Boss, why are you taking knives?

1967
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:18,987
Hey, give me the keys!

1968
01:29:19,082 --> 01:29:20,605
This is not an expensive car.

1969
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:21,553
Stop talking and

1970
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:22,574
give me the keys.

1971
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,026
Sir is interested in our car.

1972
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:25,854
We'll go by auto.

1973
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:26,441
Don't give it, Boss.

1974
01:29:26,453 --> 01:29:26,873
Tamizh, wait.

1975
01:29:27,598 --> 01:29:29,175
Oh, it's you!

1976
01:29:32,774 --> 01:29:34,477
Pick up the keys.
Don't do it.

1977
01:29:34,557 --> 01:29:36,611
Don't you hear
me? I'll kill him.

1978
01:29:36,775 --> 01:29:38,345
Hey, pick up the keys!

1979
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,384
Give him the keys.

1980
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,680
Hey, magic, is it?

1981
01:29:49,692 --> 01:29:50,406
Trying to show off?

1982
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:52,677
Shall I show you more?

1983
01:29:53,275 --> 01:29:53,911
Hey!

1984
01:29:59,087 --> 01:30:00,946
Hey, hurry up!
Drive!

1985
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,183
Hey!

1986
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,033
Don't you have any sense?

1987
01:30:57,388 --> 01:30:58,792
Hey, sorry!

1988
01:30:58,878 --> 01:31:01,602
Boss, I'm already confused.

1989
01:31:01,691 --> 01:31:03,682
Don't get angry and cooperate.

1990
01:31:03,776 --> 01:31:04,679
Okay, Boss?

1991
01:31:06,355 --> 01:31:07,292
Where is everyone?

1992
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:29,974
I'm still feeling dizzy.

1993
01:31:32,212 --> 01:31:33,259
Who put it out there?

1994
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:40,891
Boss, I had an amazing dream.

1995
01:31:41,133 --> 01:31:42,467
I dreamt of a terrific

1996
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:43,948
fight like The Matrix.

1997
01:31:44,051 --> 01:31:46,230
He fought everyone like a hero.

1998
01:31:46,325 --> 01:31:47,613
It was not a dream.

1999
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:48,652
Don't blabber!

2000
01:31:48,742 --> 01:31:49,895
I'm not blabbering.

2001
01:31:49,907 --> 01:31:51,378
He looks fine, though.

2002
01:31:51,628 --> 01:31:53,300
Why are you scanning him?

2003
01:31:53,784 --> 01:31:54,653
Listen, enough

2004
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:55,976
with the low angle.

2005
01:31:56,213 --> 01:31:58,033
Go and get me a glass of water.

2006
01:31:58,045 --> 01:31:58,656
Okay.

2007
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:00,518
He never works.

2008
01:32:01,267 --> 01:32:02,133
Good for nothing.

2009
01:32:03,138 --> 01:32:04,252
These binoculars either

2010
01:32:04,277 --> 01:32:05,452
hang on Boss's neck...

2011
01:32:05,477 --> 01:32:06,886
or it hangs on a nail.

2012
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:08,196
How is it over here?

2013
01:32:09,151 --> 01:32:10,523
Why are your fingerprints

2014
01:32:10,548 --> 01:32:11,489
on this tumbler?

2015
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:13,622
What kind of weird design

2016
01:32:13,634 --> 01:32:14,955
is it? Where did you get it?

2017
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:19,057
Are you trying to mock me?

2018
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,659
Do I look like a fool to you?

2019
01:32:21,196 --> 01:32:21,846
How dare you?

2020
01:32:22,268 --> 01:32:23,182
I ought to!

2021
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:24,338
Hey, give me a hand.

2022
01:32:24,604 --> 01:32:25,448
Give me a hand!

2023
01:32:25,877 --> 01:32:26,375
Come on!

2024
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:28,587
Oh, God!

2025
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,852
Sorry colleague.
Let me help you.

2026
01:32:34,779 --> 01:32:35,493

You don't have to.

Instead, the thieves

2113

could've taken it.

Please get inside.

Sir, the new amino acid variant

2116
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:50,297
we extracted from the alien...

2117
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:51,467
we gave it to a nervous

2118
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:52,726
systemdamaged rat like you.

2119
01:35:53,092 --> 01:35:54,045
Take a look at this.

2120
01:36:10,018 --> 01:36:11,231
Let's run a test

2121
01:36:11,243 --> 01:36:12,698
on someone else...

2122
01:36:13,034 --> 01:36:14,362
...later we can.
First thing...

2123
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,289
we don't have time for it.

2124
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,926
Second, no matter

2125
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,039
the side effects...

2126
01:36:19,556 --> 01:36:20,695
I'm fine with it.

2127
01:36:21,627 --> 01:36:22,226
Go ahead!

2128
01:38:45,917 --> 01:38:46,472
Sir...

2129
01:38:46,702 --> 01:38:47,650
This serum will

2130
01:38:47,675 --> 01:38:48,956
paralyse the alien.

2131
01:38:48,948 --> 01:38:50,715
Hereafter, it can't do anything.

2132
01:39:02,425 --> 01:39:03,253
Alien alert!

2133
01:39:03,906 --> 01:39:06,074
Yes. I'm getting
a signal from the

2134
01:39:06,086 --> 01:39:08,204
same place where
we captured him.

2135
01:39:08,322 --> 01:39:08,871
What?

2136
01:39:08,883 --> 01:39:10,564
There's a new alien
in the same spot.

2137
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:16,900
So, this alien was not alone.

2138
01:39:17,503 --> 01:39:18,969
Are you sure there are only two?

2139
01:39:19,213 --> 01:39:19,959
I'm getting a signal. But I

2140
01:39:19,971 --> 01:39:20,869
don't know how many are there.

2141
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,783
My detectors don't lie!

2142
01:39:29,418 --> 01:39:31,344
This is where Tattoo took off.

2143
01:39:33,174 --> 01:39:34,268
He flew into oblivion.

2144
01:39:46,515 --> 01:39:47,833
Our general opinion

2145
01:39:47,845 --> 01:39:49,526
about humans is wrong.

2146
01:39:50,133 --> 01:39:51,958
The truth is many good

2147
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:54,617
souls who would die for others.

2148
01:39:55,633 --> 01:39:56,374
I am living with

2149
01:39:56,386 --> 01:39:57,328
one such good soul.

2150
01:39:59,806 --> 01:40:01,219
I believe he's my equal.

2151
01:40:01,852 --> 01:40:02,767
No matter the situation,

2152
01:40:02,779 --> 01:40:03,883
his intentions never change.

2153
01:40:04,811 --> 01:40:06,482
Just because he trusted me...

2154
01:40:06,694 --> 01:40:08,906
he gave me powers like he has.

2155
01:40:24,588 --> 01:40:25,486
Search the perimeter.

2156
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:43,220
Boss!

2157
01:40:45,814 --> 01:40:47,708
Hey, Tamizh!
Hey!

2158
01:40:48,955 --> 01:40:49,943
Tell me the truth.

2159
01:40:49,955 --> 01:40:50,955
Where is Tamizh?

2160
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:53,002
What is your link to the alien?

2161
01:40:53,634 --> 01:40:54,882
Are you an alien too?

2162
01:40:54,907 --> 01:40:56,784
Sir, I may look like an alien.

2163
01:40:57,118 --> 01:40:58,273
But I'm not an alien.

2164
01:40:58,417 --> 01:40:59,340
I'm a human being.

2165
01:40:59,391 --> 01:41:00,235
Then die!

2166
01:41:03,543 --> 01:41:06,221
Happy birthday to you

2167
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:09,126
Happy birthday to Tyson

2168
01:41:09,176 --> 01:41:10,018
Damn you boys.

2169
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:11,800
Second prize for me, is it?

2170
01:41:11,885 --> 01:41:13,650
Hey, it's pronounced surprise.

2171
01:41:13,712 --> 01:41:14,696
Who asked to surprise me?

2172
01:41:15,181 --> 01:41:16,480
Is the B block girl?

2173
01:41:18,112 --> 01:41:19,963
No, it's her granny!
Hey!

2174
01:41:20,015 --> 01:41:20,900
Forget about it.

2175
01:41:20,912 --> 01:41:22,090
Did you get scared?

2176
01:41:22,206 --> 01:41:22,924
Yes Boss!

2177
01:41:23,027 --> 01:41:24,005
I was scared that I would

2178
01:41:24,017 --> 01:41:25,087
die without getting paid.

2179
01:41:25,313 --> 01:41:27,501
Enough! Boss, bring me the cake.

2180
01:41:27,578 --> 01:41:28,301
Place it down.

2181
01:41:28,313 --> 01:41:29,586
The cake looks like me.

2182
01:41:30,059 --> 01:41:31,081
Boss, I have to
blow the candles.

2183
01:41:31,141 --> 01:41:32,744
This is the only
successful surprise.

2184
01:41:32,756 --> 01:41:33,294
Awesome!

2185
01:41:33,368 --> 01:41:34,285
Here you go!

2186
01:41:35,596 --> 01:41:36,831
Here you go.
What did you say?

2187
01:41:37,586 --> 01:41:40,838
That I did not pay your salary.

2188
01:41:41,828 --> 01:41:43,060
Boss, I did not lie. I

2189
01:41:43,072 --> 01:41:44,429
was telling the truth.

2190
01:41:44,503 --> 01:41:45,711
When did he tell the truth?

2191
01:41:45,723 --> 01:41:47,023
Don't do it. Let me go!

2192
01:41:47,932 --> 01:41:48,461
He ran away.

2193
01:41:48,473 --> 01:41:49,430
Why did he run away?

2194
01:41:49,469 --> 01:41:50,321
I won't spare you.

2195
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:51,106
Hold on, Boss!

2196
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:51,853
You beat me because

2197
01:41:51,865 --> 01:41:52,753
I asked for a salary.

2198
01:41:57,715 --> 01:42:00,093
Damn!
See how I escaped.

2199
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:01,950
Now watch me.
What?

2200
01:42:06,515 --> 01:42:07,066
Yes!

2201
01:42:12,888 --> 01:42:14,001
His activities

2202
01:42:14,013 --> 01:42:15,700
remind me of Tattoo.

2203
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:17,312
I miss him a lot, Boss!
Me too.

2204
01:42:17,377 --> 01:42:18,583
It's fine. He must be

2205
01:42:18,595 --> 01:42:20,161
having fun on his planet.

2206
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:29,488
If I get superpowers...

2207
01:42:29,653 --> 01:42:31,395
I'll make you all fly.

2208
01:42:41,924 --> 01:42:44,510
Hey, can you hear me?

2209
01:42:45,768 --> 01:42:46,862
You can hear me talk.

2210
01:42:46,962 --> 01:42:48,110
Hey, don't be afraid.

2211
01:42:48,122 --> 01:42:49,392
I'm here to help you.

2212
01:42:49,502 --> 01:42:50,506
You can trust me.

2213
01:42:51,402 --> 01:42:52,236
Hey, the alien is

2214
01:42:52,248 --> 01:42:53,143
responding to me.

2215
01:42:53,212 --> 01:42:54,275
Give me some time. I'll

2216
01:42:54,287 --> 01:42:55,689
find out where the Sparc is.

2217
01:42:56,784 --> 01:42:58,213
Hey, no, no, no! Stop!

2218
01:43:01,518 --> 01:43:03,496
Aryan! Aryan, please!

2219
01:43:05,173 --> 01:43:06,651
No, no, no. Please stop.

2220
01:43:10,151 --> 01:43:11,385
Aryan, please!

2221
01:43:13,957 --> 01:43:15,473
Aryan, please don't do it.

2222
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:16,722
Stop!

2223
01:43:17,302 --> 01:43:17,849
Aryan!

2224
01:43:28,821 --> 01:43:30,314
And so, Chandrayan2 Mission

2225
01:43:30,326 --> 01:43:31,938
is a highly complex mission.

2226
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:33,400
Which represents a

2227
01:43:33,412 --> 01:43:35,546
significant technological leap.

2228
01:43:35,977 --> 01:43:37,821
Hey, look at the planets!

2229
01:43:38,782 --> 01:43:41,273
Wow!
Yeah, looks cool, right?

2230
01:43:42,422 --> 01:43:43,499
Wow!

2231
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,113
[Yddooi language]

2232
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:05,646
Let's stop this!

2233
01:44:06,515 --> 01:44:07,695
My drone has located

2234
01:44:07,707 --> 01:44:08,780
the second alien.

2235
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:09,828
Look!

2236
01:44:28,152 --> 01:44:29,386
Hey, who are you?

2237
01:44:29,582 --> 01:44:30,628
Why are pushing away people?

2238
01:45:01,575 --> 01:45:02,075
Tamizh!

2239
01:45:08,732 --> 01:45:09,623
There's no alien out there.

2240
01:45:15,788 --> 01:45:16,297
Hey!

2241
01:45:16,834 --> 01:45:17,593
If you keep

2242
01:45:17,605 --> 01:45:19,357
torturing, it will die.

2243
01:45:39,022 --> 01:45:39,782
Send the drones

2244
01:45:39,794 --> 01:45:41,030
inside the planetarium.

2245
01:46:10,657 --> 01:46:12,040
I did kill him!

2246
01:47:29,186 --> 01:47:29,811
Tamizh!

2247
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:03,187
I reckon you're indestructible.

2248
01:48:04,054 --> 01:48:05,343
Like a cockroach.

2249
01:48:05,602 --> 01:48:06,731
I should've smashed

2250
01:48:06,743 --> 01:48:07,823
you with my feet.

2251
01:48:07,979 --> 01:48:08,719
It's a mistake. I

2252
01:48:08,731 --> 01:48:09,572
resorted to a gun.

2253
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,312
Anyway, thank you!

2254
01:48:23,954 --> 01:48:25,881
Hey, can you hear me?

2255
01:48:26,688 --> 01:48:27,740
Don't be afraid. I'm

2256
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,975
not here to hurt you.

2257
01:48:29,071 --> 01:48:30,527
Trust me. Talk to me.

2258
01:48:30,687 --> 01:48:31,776
The man who came to

2259
01:48:31,788 --> 01:48:33,078
save you is in danger.

2260
01:48:33,462 --> 01:48:34,169
Listen closely to

2261
01:48:34,181 --> 01:48:34,899
what I'm saying.

2262
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:35,666
Why are you putting

2263
01:48:35,678 --> 01:48:36,713
yourself through this hell?

2264
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:37,434
Give up the

2265
01:48:37,446 --> 01:48:38,640
location of the Sparc.

2266
01:48:38,821 --> 01:48:40,250
I will help you escape.

2267
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:42,273
These people are very dangerous.

2268
01:48:42,383 --> 01:48:44,343
Now you listen to me closely.

2269
01:48:44,759 --> 01:48:45,387
Why are you putting

2270
01:48:45,399 --> 01:48:46,375
yourself through this hell?

2271
01:48:46,954 --> 01:48:48,641
These people are very dangerous.

2272
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:50,415
Why are you repeating my words?

2273
01:48:50,853 --> 01:48:52,470
What do you know about Sparc?

2274
01:48:52,642 --> 01:48:53,847
I'm asking you the same.

2275
01:48:53,859 --> 01:48:55,431
What do you know about Sparc?

2276
01:48:55,540 --> 01:48:57,508
Well, the Sparc is a tool.

2277
01:48:57,875 --> 01:48:59,247
It's a mining device used

2278
01:48:59,259 --> 01:49:01,110
to dig deeper into the Earth.

2279
01:49:01,313 --> 01:49:02,680
What would happen to the

2280
01:49:02,692 --> 01:49:04,704
Earth if you kept
digging deeper?

2281
01:49:04,813 --> 01:49:05,411
And what about the

2282
01:49:05,423 --> 01:49:06,373
people dependent on Earth?

2283
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:07,350
And the trees, living

2284
01:49:07,362 --> 01:49:08,577
beings, animals and birds?

2285
01:49:08,702 --> 01:49:10,169
What would happen to everything?

2286
01:49:10,283 --> 01:49:12,884
This is common in every project.

2287
01:49:12,993 --> 01:49:13,922
You mean to say the Earth

2288
01:49:13,934 --> 01:49:15,064
does not belong to everyone.

2289
01:49:15,188 --> 01:49:16,383
How is it possible?

2290
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,109
On Earth, humans and other

2291
01:49:18,121 --> 01:49:19,792
living beings are not equals.

2292
01:49:20,189 --> 01:49:21,198
Naturally, humans

2293
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,555
hold the majority share.

2294
01:49:23,252 --> 01:49:24,131
Humans have been

2295
01:49:24,143 --> 01:49:25,836
evolving for 2,00,000 years...

2296
01:49:26,188 --> 01:49:26,855
and yet, you people

2297
01:49:26,867 --> 01:49:27,797
think you own the Earth.

2298
01:49:28,264 --> 01:49:29,384
The cockroaches that have

2299
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:30,890
existed for 20 million years...

2300
01:49:31,094 --> 01:49:32,185
must think the Earth

2301
01:49:32,197 --> 01:49:33,135
belongs to them.

2302
01:49:33,281 --> 01:49:35,211
You realize the value of humans.

2303
01:49:35,408 --> 01:49:37,662
Humans won over nature long ago.

2304
01:49:37,783 --> 01:49:38,898
Won over nature?

2305
01:49:39,289 --> 01:49:40,226
Then who lost?

2306
01:49:40,758 --> 01:49:41,851
And you're proud of it.

2307
01:49:42,102 --> 01:49:42,915
To Earth, humans are

2308
01:49:42,927 --> 01:49:44,040
one of the living beings.

2309
01:49:44,711 --> 01:49:46,698
Okay. So, if this scheme is

2310
01:49:46,723 --> 01:49:49,685
successful, what
danger could it pose?

2311
01:49:50,093 --> 01:49:51,215
There is no danger

2312
01:49:51,227 --> 01:49:52,298
but destruction.

2313
01:51:10,309 --> 01:51:12,126
Aryan, pack your bags.

2314
01:51:12,219 --> 01:51:13,383
We are aware the

2315
01:51:13,395 --> 01:51:14,717
Sparc is missing.

2316
01:51:14,936 --> 01:51:15,963
And we know that you were

2317
01:51:15,975 --> 01:51:17,389
searching for it the whole time.

2318
01:51:17,688 --> 01:51:19,280
When we invested in this

2319
01:51:19,292 --> 01:51:21,383
project, we invested in Sparc.

2320
01:51:21,728 --> 01:51:22,537
Not you!

2321
01:51:22,687 --> 01:51:23,883
It's nothing personal.

2322
01:51:24,617 --> 01:51:25,445
Just business!

2323
01:51:26,062 --> 01:51:27,873
Instead of telling a significant

2324
01:51:27,885 --> 01:51:29,651
truth to convince everyone...

2325
01:51:30,087 --> 01:51:31,828
a small lie that easily

2326
01:51:32,173 --> 01:51:34,259
impresses the humans.

2327
01:51:34,602 --> 01:51:36,091
A small lie I told you all

2328
01:51:36,116 --> 01:51:37,904
to believe in this project...

2329
01:51:38,181 --> 01:51:39,212
is the energy source!

2330
01:51:39,454 --> 01:51:40,226
With fuel, we can

2331
01:51:40,531 --> 01:51:41,672
only do business.

2332
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:43,061
But with weapons,

2333
01:51:43,073 --> 01:51:44,516
we can rule the world.

2334
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,430
I'm going to create such

2335
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:48,555
a weapon in this project.

2336
01:51:49,435 --> 01:51:50,945
More than energy source

2337
01:51:51,328 --> 01:51:53,953
weapons will make
us a lot of money.

2338
01:51:54,906 --> 01:51:56,812
We can control the

2339
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:58,766
future warfare market.

2340
01:51:58,891 --> 01:52:00,060
What the hell? Now we

2341
01:52:00,072 --> 01:52:01,253
are making weapons?

2342
01:52:01,313 --> 01:52:02,102
What are you? Some

2343
01:52:02,114 --> 01:52:03,048
kind of Tony Stark?

2344
01:52:03,238 --> 01:52:04,708
Go on, tell us. What kind of

2345
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,149
weapon are we developing?

2346
01:52:08,897 --> 01:52:10,525
Thousands of years ago...

2347
01:52:10,624 --> 01:52:11,944
a human being who

2348
01:52:11,956 --> 01:52:14,149
rubbed two stones together

2349
01:52:14,586 --> 01:52:16,458
is the world's first

2350
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,883
energy source.

2351
01:52:18,179 --> 01:52:19,930
That's why humans are

2352
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:23,226
this world's dominant species.

2353
01:52:23,805 --> 01:52:27,575
In case that human
being had not revealed

2354
01:52:27,587 --> 01:52:30,918
the secret of how
he created fire...

2355
01:52:31,283 --> 01:52:32,557
he must've been

2356
01:52:32,569 --> 01:52:34,492
the God of this world.

2357
01:52:35,117 --> 01:52:37,398
Now I am the God!

2358
01:52:48,351 --> 01:52:49,665
Oh, my God! What's happening?

2359
01:52:52,758 --> 01:52:55,281
No! No, I can't breathe!

2360
01:52:55,398 --> 01:52:57,134
Bloody, I'll kill you!

2361
01:53:01,173 --> 01:53:02,734
Got to get out!
Have mercy!

2362
01:53:02,822 --> 01:53:04,676
This is not business.

2363
01:53:05,095 --> 01:53:06,481
It's personal.

2364
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:16,850
Had he not returned
to save me...

2365
01:53:16,985 --> 01:53:18,202
at least my loved ones

2366
01:53:18,214 --> 01:53:19,508
wouldn't be in danger.

2367
01:53:20,556 --> 01:53:21,593
If you're with me. You'll

2368
01:53:21,605 --> 01:53:22,696
be in danger, too, Tara.

2369
01:53:23,009 --> 01:53:23,688
Please go!

2370
01:53:26,798 --> 01:53:27,907
What happened?

2371
01:53:28,095 --> 01:53:29,312
Why do you sound low?

2372
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:29,827
Tattoo did not

2373
01:53:29,839 --> 01:53:30,531
return to his planet.

2374
01:53:31,516 --> 01:53:32,821
He returned to save

2375
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:34,149
me but got caught.

2376
01:53:34,884 --> 01:53:36,235
Back in the village or here...

2377
01:53:36,782 --> 01:53:38,437
What I believe just has proven

2378
01:53:38,449 --> 01:53:40,227
to bring danger to loved ones.

2379
01:53:40,603 --> 01:53:42,050
Failed attempt is not

2380
01:53:42,062 --> 01:53:43,869
a result of our mistake.

2381
01:53:44,212 --> 01:53:45,525
We fail because of the

2382
01:53:45,537 --> 01:53:46,923
bad people around us.

2383
01:53:49,026 --> 01:53:50,404
Hereafter, no one can be

2384
01:53:50,429 --> 01:53:52,052
a hindrance to my project.

2385
01:53:54,087 --> 01:53:55,217
I don't know why he chose

2386
01:53:55,229 --> 01:53:56,462
me to pass on his powers.

2387
01:53:57,196 --> 01:53:58,497
Tattoo struggled to keep

2388
01:53:58,509 --> 01:54:00,040
away the Sparc from a man.

2389
01:54:00,517 --> 01:54:01,442
But today, I handed the

2390
01:54:01,454 --> 01:54:02,431
Sparc to the same man.

2391
01:54:03,078 --> 01:54:04,018
He believed in me more

2392
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:05,328
than his life and his world.

2393
01:54:05,492 --> 01:54:06,508
But I could not uphold

2394
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:07,874
his trust and let him down.

2395
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:10,450
From the recurring events...

2396
01:54:11,103 --> 01:54:12,670
my mistake will lead

2397
01:54:12,695 --> 01:54:14,827
the world to destruction.

2398
01:54:15,038 --> 01:54:16,036
Do you think Tattoo just

2399
01:54:16,048 --> 01:54:17,266
passed on his powers to you?

2400
01:54:18,538 --> 01:54:19,234
You're mistaken, Tamizh.

2401
01:54:20,109 --> 01:54:21,021
He has even passed on

2402
01:54:21,033 --> 01:54:22,219
his responsibility to you.

2403
01:54:22,883 --> 01:54:23,901
You were farming

2404
01:54:23,913 --> 01:54:25,195
back in the village.

2405
01:54:25,564 --> 01:54:27,861
But fate brought you here.

2406
01:54:28,141 --> 01:54:29,055
This means something.

2407
01:54:30,008 --> 01:54:31,776
Tattoo had his reasons to

2408
01:54:31,788 --> 01:54:33,750
pass on the powers to you.

2409
01:54:34,455 --> 01:54:35,779
If someone who loves

2410
01:54:35,791 --> 01:54:37,728
nature more than himself...

2411
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:39,190
...it's you! And

2412
01:54:39,202 --> 01:54:40,608
Tattoo understood it.

2413
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:41,682
Even now, Tattoo may be waiting

2414
01:54:41,707 --> 01:54:42,749
for you to come and help him.

2415
01:54:43,415 --> 01:54:44,575
If he's waiting for you... Are

2416
01:54:44,587 --> 01:54:45,711
you going to disappoint him?

2417
01:54:59,149 --> 01:55:00,634
Did you come alone from another

2418
01:55:00,646 --> 01:55:02,530
planet to stop a
significant project.

2419
01:55:02,766 --> 01:55:03,490
It's your good luck.

2420
01:55:03,502 --> 01:55:04,164
I'm here for you.

2421
01:55:04,383 --> 01:55:05,093
If not, you must've

2422
01:55:05,105 --> 01:55:06,054
been stuck in this lab.

2423
01:55:06,759 --> 01:55:08,446
Hey, stop your banter.

2424
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:09,716
You got me caught.

2425
01:55:09,728 --> 01:55:11,140
It's all because of you.

2426
01:55:11,353 --> 01:55:13,329
Hey... I'm sorry.

2427
01:55:14,634 --> 01:55:16,406
But now I'm saving you.

2428
01:55:16,805 --> 01:55:18,141
So we are even now.

2429
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,374
Please take me to the

2430
01:55:20,386 --> 01:55:22,110
spaceship. I'll heal myself.

2431
01:55:22,197 --> 01:55:24,056
Oh, my God!

2432
01:55:38,691 --> 01:55:39,315
Oh...

2433
01:55:40,348 --> 01:55:42,464
Hey! Hey, where are you?

2434
01:56:07,707 --> 01:56:09,926
Hey, look here...

2435
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:11,063
Hey, listen to me.

2436
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:12,060
I will save you. And

2437
01:56:12,072 --> 01:56:13,071
you save the world.

2438
01:56:13,183 --> 01:56:13,822
Come on. I'll take

2439
01:56:13,834 --> 01:56:14,665
you to the spaceship.

2440
01:56:17,339 --> 01:56:18,488
We're almost there.

2441
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:19,609
Your spaceship

2442
01:56:19,634 --> 01:56:21,029
is behind that door.

2443
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:22,211
You can go back to your planet.

2444
01:56:22,455 --> 01:56:23,369
We'll meet again once

2445
01:56:23,381 --> 01:56:24,266
this issue blows out.

2446
01:56:27,058 --> 01:56:29,386
In the future, you must return.

2447
01:56:29,658 --> 01:56:30,464
And be a guest

2448
01:56:30,476 --> 01:56:31,877
lecturer in my seminar.

2449
01:56:32,699 --> 01:56:33,797
Then, the world will

2450
01:56:34,242 --> 01:56:36,027
believe I was telling the truth.

2451
01:56:36,571 --> 01:56:38,250
Come... Come...

2452
01:56:41,613 --> 01:56:42,542
Oh, no, they're

2453
01:56:42,554 --> 01:56:43,996
here. Turn invisible.

2454
01:56:44,643 --> 01:56:45,312
Hurry up, they're

2455
01:56:45,324 --> 01:56:46,245
here! Turn invisible.

2456
01:56:47,539 --> 01:56:48,531
Oh, God!

2457
01:56:49,496 --> 01:56:50,148
Guards!

2458
01:56:51,839 --> 01:56:53,782
It tried to attack
me and escape.

2459
01:57:16,331 --> 01:57:17,272
We got the Sparc. We

2460
01:57:17,284 --> 01:57:18,666
don't need it here anymore.

2461
01:57:19,457 --> 01:57:20,508
Where are you taking it?

2462
01:57:21,215 --> 01:57:22,109
I will come along.

2463
01:58:46,517 --> 01:58:47,993
The children are stuck in fire.

2464
01:58:48,095 --> 01:58:49,329
Quickly rescue them.

2465
01:58:49,524 --> 01:58:50,570
Come on! Hurry up!

2466
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:16,704
Oh, no! A child
is stuck in a fire.

2467
01:59:16,716 --> 01:59:18,610
Please, someone, save the child.

2468
01:59:19,202 --> 01:59:21,789
Oh, God! Please someone help!

2469
01:59:21,851 --> 01:59:22,821
The children are

2470
01:59:22,833 --> 01:59:24,000
stuck in the fire.

2471
01:59:24,188 --> 01:59:25,007
Oh, no!

2472
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:27,579
God, help us!

2473
01:59:29,016 --> 01:59:30,494
The children are stuck in the

2474
01:59:30,506 --> 01:59:32,047
fire. Please, someone, help.

2475
01:59:34,063 --> 01:59:35,586
Please someone help!

2476
01:59:35,742 --> 01:59:37,429
The children are petrified!

2477
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:42,195
Please somehow
save the children.

2478
01:59:42,562 --> 01:59:44,726
Oh, no, they're screaming!

2479
01:59:46,086 --> 01:59:48,086
Please save our children, son.

2480
02:00:00,632 --> 02:00:03,094
Bro, the entire area is on fire.

2481
02:00:03,799 --> 02:00:04,493
But you're moving

2482
02:00:04,505 --> 02:00:05,297
your hands and legs.

2483
02:00:05,892 --> 02:00:06,403
Instead, you can

2484
02:00:06,415 --> 02:00:07,047
help save the people.

2485
02:00:12,408 --> 02:00:13,172
Amma!

2486
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:17,198
Amma!

2487
02:00:20,455 --> 02:00:21,103
Amma!

2488
02:00:32,791 --> 02:00:33,453
Anna...

2489
02:00:42,382 --> 02:00:43,257
Nothing to worry.

2490
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:44,209
Don't be afraid.

2491
02:00:44,907 --> 02:00:45,907
I'm here for you.

2492
02:00:48,026 --> 02:00:48,604
Let's go.

2493
02:00:50,361 --> 02:00:50,766
[reporters] The

2494
02:00:50,778 --> 02:00:51,361
people are in panic.

2495
02:00:51,462 --> 02:00:52,767
The fire engines are

2496
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:54,556
here to put out the fire.

2497
02:00:54,675 --> 02:00:55,432
Still, they are not able to.

2498
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:55,812
The fire is

2499
02:00:55,824 --> 02:00:56,542
spreading steadfastly.

2500
02:00:56,612 --> 02:00:58,526
Not sure if it can be contained.

2501
02:00:58,581 --> 02:01:00,216
Officials are confused why

2502
02:01:00,228 --> 02:01:02,128
is there a fire in the lake?

2503
02:01:02,214 --> 02:01:04,560
This incident has caused a major

2504
02:01:04,572 --> 02:01:07,225
panic among the
people of Chennai.

2505
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:30,659
Let them do as they

2506
02:01:30,671 --> 02:01:31,983
please. Why do you bother?

2507
02:01:32,037 --> 02:01:32,486
You better return

2508
02:01:32,498 --> 02:01:32,959
to your village.

2509
02:01:33,114 --> 02:01:33,785
It's a grave issue.

2510
02:01:33,848 --> 02:01:34,671
If I don't do anything, no one

2511
02:01:34,683 --> 02:01:35,574
will have homes to go back to.

2512
02:01:35,793 --> 02:01:36,838
This project has the full

2513
02:01:36,850 --> 02:01:38,034
support of the government.

2514
02:01:38,121 --> 02:01:39,434
The project's
exceptional organization

2515
02:01:39,446 --> 02:01:40,738
has left even
environmental activists

2516
02:01:40,802 --> 02:01:42,614
unsure of its purpose.

2517
02:01:42,834 --> 02:01:44,058
They've locked up

2518
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:45,670
Tattoo like a kitten.

2519
02:01:45,826 --> 02:01:46,880
How can we go up against them?

2520
02:01:46,892 --> 02:01:47,958
They did not capture Tattoo.

2521
02:01:48,296 --> 02:01:49,261
He returned to save

2522
02:01:49,273 --> 02:01:50,249
me and got caught.

2523
02:01:50,395 --> 02:01:51,620
Now it's my responsibility.

2524
02:01:51,632 --> 02:01:52,560
You don't listen

2525
02:01:57,068 --> 02:01:58,943
For God's sake, hear me out.

2526
02:01:59,051 --> 02:02:00,323
I helped Aryan without knowing

2527
02:02:00,335 --> 02:02:01,832
the purpose of
the Sparc project.

2528
02:02:01,921 --> 02:02:02,577
I'm sorry!

2529
02:02:02,687 --> 02:02:03,928
They're going to sell the alien.

2530
02:02:04,006 --> 02:02:05,622
If we don't stop this project...

2531
02:02:05,678 --> 02:02:06,657
the Madagascar tragedy

2532
02:02:06,669 --> 02:02:08,021
will repeat in your country.

2533
02:02:08,131 --> 02:02:08,963
Save the alien.

2534
02:02:08,975 --> 02:02:10,326
And stop this project.

2535
02:02:10,351 --> 02:02:11,585
Only you can do it!

2536
02:02:47,517 --> 02:02:48,946
" Do not play with me "

2537
02:02:49,611 --> 02:02:50,410
" You will get beaten

2538
02:02:50,422 --> 02:02:51,079
up every time "

2539
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:52,367
" I am different And I

2540
02:02:52,379 --> 02:02:53,189
take a different path "

2541
02:02:53,626 --> 02:02:54,357
" I am like Chandrayan,

2542
02:02:54,369 --> 02:02:55,306
travelling in outer space "

2543
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:57,368
" Do not test my patience "

2544
02:02:57,689 --> 02:02:59,463
" Ablaze like a match stick "

2545
02:02:59,845 --> 02:03:01,704
" No useless
talks, only action "

2546
02:03:01,876 --> 02:03:02,805
" Do not stand here,

2547
02:03:02,817 --> 02:03:03,852
Get out of my face "

2548
02:03:03,931 --> 02:03:05,751
" I am clean and
leave no trace "

2549
02:03:06,172 --> 02:03:06,732
" My play is like

2550
02:03:06,744 --> 02:03:07,485
Virat Kohli's sixer "

2551
02:03:07,532 --> 02:03:08,427
" My people stand with me

2552
02:03:08,439 --> 02:03:09,564
And they aren't so ordinary "

2553
02:03:09,611 --> 02:03:10,782
" Don't take us easy "

2554
02:03:11,806 --> 02:03:12,767
" This is no warning "

2555
02:03:13,009 --> 02:03:14,907
" This isn't a concert "

2556
02:03:15,181 --> 02:03:17,017
" It is a fire cracker "

2557
02:03:17,251 --> 02:03:18,274
" Don't get into problems

2558
02:03:18,286 --> 02:03:19,321
Got to close the gate "

2559
02:03:19,824 --> 02:03:21,220
" Do not play with me "

2560
02:03:21,939 --> 02:03:22,721
" You will get beaten

2561
02:03:22,733 --> 02:03:23,376
up every time "

2562
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,683
" I am different And I

2563
02:03:24,695 --> 02:03:25,484
take a different path "

2564
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:26,729
" I am like Chandrayan,

2565
02:03:26,741 --> 02:03:27,587
travelling in outer space "

2566
02:03:28,011 --> 02:03:29,681
" Do not test my patience "

2567
02:03:30,032 --> 02:03:31,978
" Ablaze "

2568
02:03:37,504 --> 02:03:38,355
" The bright future

2569
02:03:38,367 --> 02:03:39,230
Starts only now "

2570
02:03:39,286 --> 02:03:40,338
" Flying high like aeroplanes

2571
02:03:40,350 --> 02:03:41,341
Killing needs no reason "

2572
02:03:41,419 --> 02:03:42,247
" This is my time I

2573
02:03:42,259 --> 02:03:43,231
don't need a clock "

2574
02:03:43,341 --> 02:03:44,188
" All weeks, all months

2575
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,208
Stunting on is my habit "

2576
02:03:45,294 --> 02:03:46,465
" I am from a different world,

2577
02:03:46,477 --> 02:03:47,817
One of a kind and no confusion "

2578
02:03:47,911 --> 02:03:48,713
" Tell me who else

2579
02:03:48,725 --> 02:03:49,630
can be like this? "

2580
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:50,693
" Their style is old

2581
02:03:50,705 --> 02:03:52,051
Ask them to dust it out "

2582
02:03:52,162 --> 02:03:53,106
" Our style is shining

2583
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:54,247
Like diamond jewellery "

2584
02:03:54,317 --> 02:03:55,157
" Run till you die Run

2585
02:03:55,169 --> 02:03:56,215
when I am with my party "

2586
02:03:56,287 --> 02:03:56,603
" If you fight with

2587
02:03:56,615 --> 02:03:56,943
us you're doomed "

2588
02:03:56,974 --> 02:03:57,548
" Good luck to you

2589
02:03:57,560 --> 02:03:58,373
This is a new chapter "

2590
02:03:58,443 --> 02:03:59,366
" From Chennai to

2591
02:03:59,378 --> 02:04:00,974
Singapore It is quite hot "

2592
02:04:01,014 --> 02:04:01,949
" Keep it a hundred

2593
02:04:01,961 --> 02:04:03,208
Since that's our rule "

2594
02:04:07,334 --> 02:04:08,810
" Ablaze "

2595
02:04:43,191 --> 02:04:44,647
You!
Hey, Dexter, stop, stop!

2596
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:12,530
I must stop, Aryan.

2597
02:06:13,132 --> 02:06:14,110
If not, the Nova gas will leak.

2598
02:06:14,122 --> 02:06:14,452
Tamizh!

2599
02:06:15,093 --> 02:06:16,303
I have to save everyone.

2600
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:37,594
I could not save the Sparc.

2601
02:06:37,766 --> 02:06:38,656
First, I must safely

2602
02:06:38,668 --> 02:06:39,508
send you back home.

2603
02:06:42,797 --> 02:06:43,744
I read the message

2604
02:06:43,756 --> 02:06:44,594
from your lover.

2605
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:46,506
But I cannot understand

2606
02:06:46,518 --> 02:06:47,234
what she said.

2607
02:06:47,844 --> 02:06:48,722
But I understood that

2608
02:06:48,734 --> 02:06:49,687
she's waiting for you.

2609
02:06:53,125 --> 02:06:55,234
You must accomplish
your mission.

2610
02:06:56,142 --> 02:06:57,478
But now it's my responsibility.

2611
02:06:57,783 --> 02:06:58,555
What responsibility?

2612
02:06:58,787 --> 02:06:59,743
What do you mean?

2613
02:06:59,908 --> 02:07:00,782
I'm speaking in Tamil.

2614
02:07:00,794 --> 02:07:01,600
Do you understand?

2615
02:07:10,064 --> 02:07:10,625
Yes!

2616
02:07:16,501 --> 02:07:17,538
You fool!

2617
02:07:19,836 --> 02:07:20,539
Tattoo run!

2618
02:07:36,088 --> 02:07:36,634
Tattoo!

2619
02:07:40,969 --> 02:07:42,076
You, too, lost your powers?

2620
02:07:48,375 --> 02:07:49,804
Come on! Hurry up!

2621
02:07:49,845 --> 02:07:50,836
Hurry up! Get in the van.

2622
02:07:50,848 --> 02:07:51,272
Come on!

2623
02:07:51,977 --> 02:07:52,505
Come on!

2624
02:07:53,962 --> 02:07:56,469
Hey, where are you going?

2625
02:07:59,016 --> 02:08:01,016
Sir!
It's okay!

2626
02:08:01,851 --> 02:08:03,178
Like how the alien saved

2627
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:05,086
you I believe it'll save me too.

2628
02:08:08,737 --> 02:08:10,741
Sir, sir, sir. Don't worry, sir!

2629
02:08:22,141 --> 02:08:23,876
Go! Hurry up!

2630
02:08:27,868 --> 02:08:28,720
Damn it!

2631
02:08:34,711 --> 02:08:35,405
With no powers how

2632
02:08:35,417 --> 02:08:36,320
could it be an alien?

2633
02:08:36,688 --> 02:08:38,331
Boss, he will be cured if we

2634
02:08:38,343 --> 02:08:40,117
take him to a Siddha Doctor.

2635
02:08:40,187 --> 02:08:40,804
Why?

2636
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:42,103
Only they advertise to

2637
02:08:42,115 --> 02:08:43,195
renew powers that are lost.

2638
02:08:43,235 --> 02:08:44,896
Hey! I told you that Aryan is

2639
02:08:45,007 --> 02:08:47,083
powerful and not
to mess with him.

2640
02:08:47,149 --> 02:08:48,188
But you were hellbent

2641
02:08:48,213 --> 02:08:49,264
on saving the world.

2642
02:08:49,375 --> 02:08:51,132
Now, we all are going to die!

2643
02:08:51,296 --> 02:08:52,805
We must expose Aryan's

2644
02:08:52,817 --> 02:08:54,960
true intentions to the world.

2645
02:08:55,187 --> 02:08:56,365
That's the only option left.

2646
02:08:56,498 --> 02:08:57,560
I don't have time for it.

2647
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:58,835
First, we need to retrieve

2648
02:08:58,847 --> 02:08:59,694
the Sparc from Aryan.

2649
02:09:00,219 --> 02:09:02,227
Aryan? Who is he?

2650
02:09:02,438 --> 02:09:02,969
Hey!

2651
02:09:03,719 --> 02:09:05,328
Hey, what happened to you?

2652
02:09:05,648 --> 02:09:06,968
Did you lose your memory?

2653
02:09:07,172 --> 02:09:07,930
Memory, as in?

2654
02:09:08,116 --> 02:09:09,234
Tattoo, you're from

2655
02:09:09,246 --> 02:09:10,436
a different planet.

2656
02:09:10,671 --> 02:09:11,272
Do you remember

2657
02:09:11,284 --> 02:09:12,225
your purpose of visit?

2658
02:09:12,351 --> 02:09:13,317
You don't like it when

2659
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:14,351
we call you an alien.

2660
02:09:14,405 --> 02:09:16,046
ALIEN

2661
02:09:16,437 --> 02:09:17,070
I like it!

2662
02:09:17,219 --> 02:09:19,039
Boss, step aside.
He's gone nuts!

2663
02:09:19,266 --> 02:09:20,515
Hey, who are you calling nuts?

2664
02:09:20,633 --> 02:09:21,792
You and your family are nuts.

2665
02:09:21,804 --> 02:09:22,429
How dare you?

2666
02:09:22,561 --> 02:09:23,237
See, he does not

2667
02:09:23,249 --> 02:09:24,195
fail to troll others.

2668
02:09:24,226 --> 02:09:24,851
You're speaking without

2669
02:09:24,863 --> 02:09:26,250
understanding the
gravity of the situation.

2670
02:09:26,649 --> 02:09:27,536
Every second, the Sparc remains

2671
02:09:27,548 --> 02:09:28,649
with Aryan is a
danger to the world.

2672
02:09:28,882 --> 02:09:30,421
Sparc! What's a Sparc?

2673
02:09:30,655 --> 02:09:31,636
Hey! Even if you went

2674
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,162
mute it wouldn't be a problem.

2675
02:09:33,296 --> 02:09:34,084
But you lost your memory

2676
02:09:34,096 --> 02:09:34,929
and killing me with it.

2677
02:09:35,271 --> 02:09:36,336
Are we looking for a Sparc

2678
02:09:36,348 --> 02:09:37,507
or are we killing someone?

2679
02:09:37,576 --> 02:09:39,459
God help us!
Hey!

2680
02:09:39,577 --> 02:09:40,655
How do we fix him?

2681
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:41,556
Let's dismantle him and

2682
02:09:41,568 --> 02:09:42,648
throw it in the dump yard.

2683
02:09:42,828 --> 02:09:43,492
Giving me looks!

2684
02:09:43,796 --> 02:09:44,465
If I go inside the

2685
02:09:44,477 --> 02:09:45,499
spaceship, I'll be cured.

2686
02:09:45,555 --> 02:09:45,977
Because I'm an

2687
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:46,734
extraterrestrial being.

2688
02:09:47,649 --> 02:09:48,828
Correct!
Richie Street?

2689
02:09:48,883 --> 02:09:49,547
Spaceship.

2690
02:09:49,929 --> 02:09:51,132
If we take him there, he'll

2691
02:09:51,144 --> 02:09:52,585
regain lost memory and powers.

2692
02:09:52,883 --> 02:09:53,674
It's not like the spaceship is

2693
02:09:53,686 --> 02:09:54,570
parked on the side of the road.

2694
02:09:54,662 --> 02:09:55,568
Aryan is holding it.

2695
02:09:55,803 --> 02:09:56,615
If we go there, we won't

2696
02:09:56,627 --> 02:09:57,623
get powers but end up dead.

2697
02:09:57,820 --> 02:09:58,990
We can't surpass

2698
02:09:59,002 --> 02:10:00,850
Aryan's security guards.

2699
02:10:03,593 --> 02:10:04,530
I have an idea.

2700
02:10:24,593 --> 02:10:25,499
Important announcement!

2701
02:10:25,732 --> 02:10:27,449
Pongal special  raw rice,

2702
02:10:27,461 --> 02:10:29,455
sugar, jaggery, sugarcane...

2703
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:30,974
is waiting for you all.

2704
02:10:30,999 --> 02:10:32,024
We request you all to run

2705
02:10:32,036 --> 02:10:33,281
to your nearest ration shop.

2706
02:10:39,028 --> 02:10:39,848
Tysa!

2707
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:43,164
Come on, Tysa!

2708
02:10:47,435 --> 02:10:48,731
How's my idea?

2709
02:10:51,513 --> 02:10:52,848
No one thought of it.

2710
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:14,065
Why is he returning?

2711
02:11:14,161 --> 02:11:15,778
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

2712
02:11:18,145 --> 02:11:20,410
Boss!
Hey!

2713
02:11:20,927 --> 02:11:23,289
Boss, your idea is not working.

2714
02:11:23,363 --> 02:11:24,046
To the other side.

2715
02:11:25,181 --> 02:11:25,908
He's turning around.

2716
02:11:39,924 --> 02:11:40,778
Hey, idiot, switch

2717
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:41,680
off the lights.

2718
02:11:52,276 --> 02:11:52,909
Oh, no!

2719
02:12:01,857 --> 02:12:02,622
Hurry up!

2720
02:12:18,122 --> 02:12:18,606
Hey!

2721
02:12:20,496 --> 02:12:22,437
What are you doing? Hold on

2722
02:13:21,237 --> 02:13:22,182
Robot!

2723
02:13:28,553 --> 02:13:30,609
Tattoo, go from here.

2724
02:13:43,717 --> 02:13:44,513
Oh, no!

2725
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,231
Did you like it?

2726
02:13:48,426 --> 02:13:49,917
First, go to the spaceship.

2727
02:14:54,448 --> 02:14:55,276
Tattoo!

2728
02:15:08,924 --> 02:15:09,687
Where is Sparc?

2729
02:15:11,619 --> 02:15:14,081
Hey, your memory is back?

2730
02:15:14,642 --> 02:15:15,595
The Sparc is...

2731
02:15:39,799 --> 02:15:40,955
The powers are back, Tattoo.

2732
02:15:47,337 --> 02:15:48,658
Hey, hey, hey. I'm coming too.

2733
02:15:57,392 --> 02:15:58,111
Oh, god!

2734
02:16:03,537 --> 02:16:05,099
Maybe there's a glitch.

2735
02:16:05,223 --> 02:16:06,645
The power keeps fluctuating.

2736
02:16:18,207 --> 02:16:18,863
Let go!

2737
02:16:31,331 --> 02:16:32,279
Only now are the

2738
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:33,432
powers truly back!

2739
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:36,883
Robot!

2740
02:17:40,122 --> 02:17:40,961
Thanks, bud!

2741
02:26:05,003 --> 02:26:06,894
Tattoo, come on!

2742
02:26:27,937 --> 02:26:30,276
[news] The
shocking fire incident

2743
02:26:30,301 --> 02:26:32,584
that shook the people of Chennai

2744
02:26:32,867 --> 02:26:33,792
was caused by Aryan

2745
02:26:33,804 --> 02:26:35,145
Industries Research Labs.

2746
02:26:35,251 --> 02:26:36,591
By court order, the lab has

2747
02:26:36,603 --> 02:26:38,056
been permanently shut down.

2748
02:26:43,982 --> 02:26:45,330
Hereafter, this project

2749
02:26:45,342 --> 02:26:46,466
won't be an issue.

2750
02:26:47,256 --> 02:26:48,779
They have banned it.

2751
02:26:50,645 --> 02:26:51,544
What about Sparc?

2752
02:26:56,656 --> 02:26:57,174
Now that all the

2753
02:26:57,186 --> 02:26:58,015
problems are resolved...

2754
02:26:58,187 --> 02:26:59,075
you stay back for a while

2755
02:26:59,087 --> 02:27:00,202
and grace the upcoming event.

2756
02:27:00,342 --> 02:27:01,029
If I stay back any

2757
02:27:01,041 --> 02:27:01,779
longer on earth...

2758
02:27:01,934 --> 02:27:02,848
I'll be tortured to

2759
02:27:02,873 --> 02:27:03,944
get an identity card.

2760
02:27:04,437 --> 02:27:05,530
He's right about it.

2761
02:27:05,711 --> 02:27:06,611
On the ID card, even our

2762
02:27:06,623 --> 02:27:07,648
faces look like an alien.

2763
02:27:07,828 --> 02:27:08,804
Imagine how he'd look!

2764
02:27:08,896 --> 02:27:11,172
Don't you dare talk about face?

2765
02:27:11,266 --> 02:27:12,213
Hey, Siddha!

2766
02:27:13,831 --> 02:27:15,719
I really admire your work.

2767
02:27:15,852 --> 02:27:17,032
I'm planning to start a similar

2768
02:27:17,044 --> 02:27:18,159
business back on my planet.

2769
02:27:18,484 --> 02:27:20,041
Give me the name of your planet.

2770
02:27:20,127 --> 02:27:21,017
I will be proud to
promote that we

2771
02:27:21,029 --> 02:27:21,930
have branches
across the universe.

2772
02:27:24,023 --> 02:27:27,070
Wait! Don't show off!

2773
02:27:27,176 --> 02:27:27,605
Go!

2774
02:27:28,474 --> 02:27:30,474
Please don't forget me!

2775
02:27:30,957 --> 02:27:32,161
I won't forget you.

2776
02:27:32,255 --> 02:27:33,065
I'll never forget the film

2777
02:27:33,077 --> 02:27:34,151
Enthiran we watched it together.

2778
02:27:34,513 --> 02:27:35,482
If you stay back I'll play

2779
02:27:35,494 --> 02:27:36,361
you the movie Jailer.

2780
02:27:36,458 --> 02:27:37,575
But you are going!

2781
02:27:43,716 --> 02:27:44,425
He's asking you to eat

2782
02:27:44,437 --> 02:27:45,419
tomatoes after they're ripe.

2783
02:27:51,615 --> 02:27:52,560
I'll be missing you.

2784
02:27:52,628 --> 02:27:54,105
Hereafter, when you teach the

2785
02:27:54,117 --> 02:27:55,914
kids about space,
mention me too.

2786
02:27:56,163 --> 02:27:56,840
Sure!

2787
02:28:07,569 --> 02:28:09,746
Are you upset that I'm leaving?

2788
02:28:09,973 --> 02:28:10,706
Upset?

2789
02:28:11,887 --> 02:28:12,495
No!

2790
02:28:13,553 --> 02:28:14,820
Why would I be upset?

2791
02:28:15,059 --> 02:28:15,972
You mean to say you're not

2792
02:28:15,984 --> 02:28:16,980
upset because I'm leaving.

2793
02:28:18,043 --> 02:28:19,276
Absolutely not!

2794
02:28:20,971 --> 02:28:24,145
I have Tara and my friends.

2795
02:28:24,201 --> 02:28:24,803
Also, my mother is

2796
02:28:24,815 --> 02:28:25,497
back in my village.

2797
02:28:25,659 --> 02:28:27,060
It's you who is travelling

2798
02:28:27,072 --> 02:28:28,348
to an unknown planet.

2799
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:30,918
Even I have a girlfriend,

2800
02:28:30,930 --> 02:28:32,417
friends and family.

2801
02:28:32,646 --> 02:28:33,198
Go ahead. Your

2802
02:28:33,674 --> 02:28:34,646
spaceship is about to leave.

2803
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:36,354
I'm going!

2804
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:05,049
People of my planet have an

2805
02:29:05,376 --> 02:29:07,520
impression that humans
are worse beings.

2806
02:29:08,072 --> 02:29:08,998
Only after I arrived

2807
02:29:09,010 --> 02:29:10,042
here did I believe...

2808
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:10,867
humans are one of

2809
02:29:10,879 --> 02:29:11,752
the best living beings.

2810
02:29:11,809 --> 02:29:13,359
Do you mean us?

2811
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:14,573
Yes!

2812
02:29:14,918 --> 02:29:17,079
Except for humans, other living

2813
02:29:17,091 --> 02:29:19,755
beings kill their
weakest offspring.

2814
02:29:20,106 --> 02:29:22,476
But only humans
take care of their

2815
02:29:22,488 --> 02:29:24,893
specially abled
children until death.

2816
02:29:26,418 --> 02:29:28,403
I will tell my people
that there are

2817
02:29:28,415 --> 02:29:30,307
good souls with
full love on earth.

2818
02:29:33,583 --> 02:29:34,096
Tattoo!

2819
02:29:35,663 --> 02:29:36,480
If the earth is in

2820
02:29:36,505 --> 02:29:37,702
danger, will you return?

2821
02:29:37,809 --> 02:29:38,700
You people create

2822
02:29:38,712 --> 02:29:39,614
danger to earth.

2823
02:29:39,919 --> 02:29:40,522
But you want us

2824
02:29:40,534 --> 02:29:41,396
to come and save it.

2825
02:29:41,638 --> 02:29:42,141
Hereafter, you

2826
02:29:42,153 --> 02:29:43,036
should take care of it.

2827
02:29:43,355 --> 02:29:44,800
We are ordinary human beings.

2828
02:29:45,216 --> 02:29:46,738
It's impossible for us to do it.

2829
02:29:48,052 --> 02:29:48,981
You can do it!

2830
02:29:50,904 --> 02:29:51,696
Hey, you people

2831
02:29:51,708 --> 02:29:52,887
are prone to selfies!

2832
02:29:52,983 --> 02:29:53,943
But now you're silent!

2833
02:29:55,084 --> 02:29:55,857
Smile!

2834
02:29:58,356 --> 02:29:59,593
Tata Tattoo!
Bye!

2835
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:04,581
Tattoo, give my

2836
02:30:04,593 --> 02:30:05,965
regards to your parents.

2837
02:30:15,059 --> 02:30:16,453
Bye!
Bye!

2838
02:30:16,672 --> 02:30:17,648
Bye Tattoo!

2839
02:30:19,198 --> 02:30:20,080
Tattoo, Tata!

2840
02:30:34,750 --> 02:30:35,579
Pray to God to bless

2841
02:30:35,591 --> 02:30:36,495
you with a good heart.

2842
02:30:37,095 --> 02:30:38,156
Hey, Boss! He arrived

2843
02:30:38,168 --> 02:30:39,344
and impressed a girl.

2844
02:30:39,423 --> 02:30:39,842
And now brought

2845
02:30:39,854 --> 02:30:40,602
her back to his village.

2846
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:41,324
Learn from him.

2847
02:30:41,336 --> 02:30:42,236
You're right about it.

2848
02:30:42,308 --> 02:30:43,159
The lads from the village

2849
02:30:43,171 --> 02:30:44,378
manage to impress
the city girls.

2850
02:30:44,456 --> 02:30:45,151
But we boys in the

2851
02:30:45,163 --> 02:30:45,909
city are hopeless.

2852
02:30:46,003 --> 02:30:46,690
You got an opportunity, but

2853
02:30:46,702 --> 02:30:47,557
you lost it to your office boy.

2854
02:30:47,657 --> 02:30:48,423
Don't glare at me.

2855
02:30:48,641 --> 02:30:49,754
My child is drowning.

2856
02:30:49,766 --> 02:30:50,945
Someone please help.

2857
02:30:51,711 --> 02:30:53,539
Someone please help.
Tamizh!

2858
02:30:54,017 --> 02:30:54,969
Oh, dear God!

2859
02:30:55,024 --> 02:30:56,055
Please save the child.

2860
02:30:56,067 --> 02:30:57,156
My child is drowning.

2861
02:30:57,297 --> 02:30:59,508
Please, someone, help!

2862
02:30:59,734 --> 02:31:01,522
Please save my child.

2863
02:31:45,102 --> 02:31:46,213
" Shorty, let me pick you

2864
02:31:46,225 --> 02:31:47,438
