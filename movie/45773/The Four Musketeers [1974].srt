1
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:56,093
I remember when young D'Artagnan
was made a Musketeer to the king.

2
00:01:56,094 --> 00:02:00,213
Splendid ceremony, you know.
All the best people,

3
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:02,475
creamed of French society.

4
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,600
I was there, off course.

5
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:11,796
Who but I, with Aramis and Athos could
put the tabard on D'Artagnan shoulder?

6
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:15,770
It is important for a young
man rising in the world...

7
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:19,710
should be seen to have a
worthy and well sponsored.

8
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,017
It gives people confidence.

9
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,309
And the king approved.

10
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,725
And the Queen, as well she might.

11
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:33,483
But was it not D'Artagnan, Aramis,
Athos and I would save her reputation.

12
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:38,672
And prevented her love affair with
the Duke of Buckingham from scandal.

13
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,684
Stupid woman, you see,
becoming infatuated...

14
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:45,382
with an Englishman and an
English Prime Minister as well.

15
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:47,184
D'Artagnan...

16
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,017
deserved his reward.

17
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:53,966
The four had risked our skin
and reputation on her behalf...

18
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:58,880
against perilous enemies.
The Cardinal Richelieu for one.

19
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:01,684
A formidable man and hungry for power.

20
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:05,549
Who would've exposed and ruined
the Queen to serve his own ambition.

21
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,850
No gentleman, you see.

22
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:11,833
His agents were Milady de Winter
and her lover, Rochefort,

23
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:15,434
two birds of prey in fine feathers.

24
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:17,642
She would never forgive D'Artagnan...

25
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:22,834
or his mistress Constance for
defeating her plot against the Queen.

26
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,174
Revenge was what Milady wanted.

27
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,100
A dreadful woman.

28
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:31,250
But what did we care for her
or Rochefort or Cardinal?

29
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:35,059
We were young and carefree,
as Musketeers should be.

30
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,350
And D'Artagnan was in
love with his dressmaker.

31
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:44,424
And there was work, fighting in service
against the Protestants of La Rochelle.

32
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:49,589
We tried to teach the rebels
the meaning of Christian charity,

33
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,309
by bombarding them into surrender.

34
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,081
These thugs with the idea of
a working class as a religion!

35
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:01,248
Even our old enemy Rochefort,
the Cardinal's jackal blade...

36
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:05,378
is spying for us inside
the walls of La Rochelle.

37
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,184
Unsuccesfully, you see.

38
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:12,293
Fortunately for him, we three played
our part, disdain is what I thought.

39
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:17,145
Rescue a spy, no gentleman. Leave
him where he is, if I had my way.

40
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:21,963
- This is enough for him.
- We did not know how many.

41
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,975
Yes, you did.

42
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:26,796
Return your stick!

43
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:30,049
Put in bullets!

44
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,924
Shake the rod load!

45
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:41,305
Recover your muskets!

46
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,887
Light the wick!

47
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,592
Blow off your coal!

48
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,892
Cock your musket!

49
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:04,469
Has Porthos got the horses ready?

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,100
Yes.

51
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,213
Has he got the horses ready?

52
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,184
Yes!

53
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,684
Blindfold!

54
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:15,642
Place the muskets!

55
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:18,463
Perhaps I could close one eye.

56
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:22,261
Poise your muskets!

57
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,350
Now!

58
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,755
The bomb! Quickly!

59
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:30,592
Open the look!

60
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,799
The fuse, Athos! The fuse!

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,888
Present!

62
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,596
Fire!

63
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:56,094
Damn fools!
Can't you even shoot a man?

64
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,934
Reload!

65
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:02,300
Why bother?
I may died of old age.

66
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:34,017
Get on the horse, Rochefort!
Hurry!

67
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:41,552
- You arrive just in time!
- Who hurries to rescue a spy?

68
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:13,511
Seal off our escape!

69
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,254
The gate!

70
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:18,840
Yes, right.

71
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:39,715
Aramis!

72
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:48,391
Go under if you can!

73
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:11,184
Hit it now! Like that!
No, again! Again!

74
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:18,047
I'd rather die than have to
bring you this news, Your Majesty.

75
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,934
The rebels would not surrender,
they expect a fleet...

76
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:25,196
...to aid them under
the Duke of Buckingham.

77
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:29,423
- I'd rather I die.
- I would rather.

78
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:30,392
We would all rather.

79
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:34,177
- I owe my life, Your Majesty.
- I don't want it!

80
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,508
I don't want those stories either.

81
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:41,934
I want to make a triumphant
entry to La Rochelle.

82
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:46,879
- Duke of Buckingham covet my Queen.
- No, Sire.

83
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,249
He wants La Rochelle,
he will assist the rebels.

84
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,809
But your Queen is
not a traitor to France.

85
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,099
- Not to France. To me.
- But Your Majesty is France.

86
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:05,414
Tell the rabble which leaves
not to storm La Rochelle.

87
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:10,332
Time will shatter those walls, Majesty.
La Rochelle will fall.

88
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:15,216
But it is boring,
battling away day after day.

89
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,138
Sire,

90
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:20,670
Shall we siege on here while
Your Majesty returns to Paris...

91
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,343
to your Queen, your faithfull Queen?

92
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:26,392
Leave this dirty business to us.

93
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:30,672
It is dirty business, and the
Queen is a traitor to my bed.

94
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:34,809
You should think yourself lucky.

95
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:42,091
I can place my musketeers in
danger to help you out of there.

96
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:47,297
I shall not do it again, spy. If you
have another eye, you might see why.

97
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:50,264
Good, I like that.

98
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:56,131
The gratitude of princes.

99
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:59,684
Spy? It is a foul word.

100
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:03,599
It is a familiar word to me,
Eminence, in your service.

101
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:07,918
To your knees, little man,

102
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,933
before your master!

103
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:15,934
Now hear me, Rochefort.

104
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:21,007
The Queen sends letter of love
to Buckingham. She should not.

105
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:24,168
Not while Buckingham
sends fleet against France.

106
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:27,295
I would have you stop these letters,
by stopping their girl between.

107
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:31,706
The woman Bonacieux,
Queen's dressmaker.

108
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:35,225
You will remove her, my son.

109
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:38,780
This time do not
require me to rescue you.

110
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:42,767
She is, after all, only a woman.

111
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,017
I tell you, that goose is tender, sir.

112
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,528
See? Now, say you're sorry.

113
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,595
You don't want it.

114
00:10:55,476 --> 00:11:01,296
My mother says that only well
can you tell if fresh.

115
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:03,221
Peaches!

116
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,059
Are they not beautiful?

117
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,085
Beside you, Constance my dear,
they look old and wrinkled.

118
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,013
Melons!

119
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:19,303
Clumsy clown.
Whose going to pay for them?

120
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:21,638
D'Artagnan?

121
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:23,929
D'Artagnan!

122
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,096
Away with her.

123
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:43,679
Stand up and fight, you coward!

124
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,293
Poor, poor gentleman.

125
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:06,309
Rene!

126
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,795
Come, lift him into to coach.
But, gently.

127
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,923
He's hurt.

128
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,642
But Constance...

129
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,888
Be still.
I should take care of you.

130
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:36,558
Really, Kitty. He's a
most handsome young man.

131
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:42,517
- You are awake, sir?
- Who are you?

132
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:45,555
A friend.

133
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,850
Constance's melons!

134
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,336
- I have to go!
- You are being foolish.

135
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:55,591
I must find Constance.

136
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:05,333
Please forgive me.
Such kindness to a stranger.

137
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,100
Sir!

138
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:11,882
You are not well. Trully.
You should lie down.

139
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:14,434
Should.

140
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:18,634
No. But I will be back...

141
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:23,266
to thank you properly.

142
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,892
A most handsome young man.

143
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:20,674
If he's bleeding lot of blood
in the gutter, I'd have my way.

144
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:24,725
And you are a friend.

145
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:30,384
You know what he'd say if he knew we
had his dressmaker under lock and key?

146
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:35,588
So much beauty wasted in
a ridiculous musketeer.

147
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,758
I merely obey the Cardinal's
orders and keep him occupied.

148
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,045
Isn't that all the Cardinal wants?

149
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:47,764
You do have a habit
to enjoying your work.

150
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,892
What do you say, Lord Buckingham?

151
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:23,842
If God intended us to swim underwater,
he would giving us fins.

152
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:30,416
If I go to break the siege of La
Rochelle, we shall go with ships.

153
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,225
Well...

154
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:36,642
This under sea boat of yours
is an ingenious invention,

155
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:41,088
but how many carts of salt beef
can you carry to the rebels?

156
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,499
How many big guns can you take
to blow old Richelieu to hell?

157
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,517
We're coming!

158
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:55,515
But this boat is big enough
to steal the Queen of France.

159
00:15:56,268 --> 00:16:00,250
I do not need to steal
the Queen of France. / No.

160
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:05,008
When the time is ripe,
we shall be together.

161
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,418
My dear sweet Anne...

162
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,710
Stupid priests!

163
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:11,892
Stupid Protestants!

164
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:16,634
Three weeks sneezing in the rain
at La Rochelle, and for what?

165
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,684
The best of my wardrobe
still on its way back to Paris.

166
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:24,343
These religious wars. Beatrice,
I could lose all patience!

167
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:27,142
- Perhaps, Majesty, this one...
- No!

168
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:30,142
That makes me like a burst cushion.

169
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:34,509
Constance will just have to
make me a new one. Where is she?

170
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:40,051
- Where's the Queen's dressmaker?
- Constance is not to be found.

171
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:41,517
What do you mean?

172
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:45,667
She has not been seen for
two days. Not here or home.

173
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:48,968
She has, gone.

174
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,884
The Cardinal.

175
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:56,012
Beatrice, what have they done with her?

176
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,142
But where? Where?

177
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:04,914
You say they kidnapped her under
your nose? And only four of them?

178
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:08,247
Lose ones mistress in the
conventional way is bad enough,

179
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:11,545
but to have her carried off
like a basket of washing...

180
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:14,178
that's careless, almost bad taste!

181
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:19,838
Especially when one has paying
attention to a beautiful, great Milady.

182
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,044
Your poor Madame Bonacieux
would probably prefers to stay...

183
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:24,809
with the kidnappers.

184
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,548
Mine mistresses would,
If I treated her so.

185
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,514
Aramis! Aramis!

186
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,684
Observe my new trick!

187
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:42,048
My opponent is there, about
to unsheathe, when suddenly...

188
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:50,049
Oh, Porthos.

189
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,597
Try it again.

190
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,257
Only Porthos could invent a
new way of disarming himself.

191
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,586
Will you never learn?

192
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,895
Kidnap her? Why?

193
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,635
Not even listening.

194
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:18,219
- It was a scientific experiment!
- Athos, are you hurt?

195
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:22,933
What I am is drunk.

196
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,759
What you are, sir,

197
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,722
troubled.

198
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,431
Child, you are troubled.

199
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,934
What's the matter?

200
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:49,173
It's my mistress. She was
snatched from my side... / Good.

201
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:52,302
Has you discovered their hiding place?

202
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,975
- No.
- Good!

203
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:59,089
I am told that you have
found another. / No!

204
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,642
Porthos told me.

205
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:05,345
Now, is Porthos a liar?

206
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,094
No.

207
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,964
He speaks to me of a certain
milady who lead you by the hand.

208
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:18,475
No, no, no!
I love her with my head.

209
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:22,525
But my Constance, snatched from
my side, I love with my heart.

210
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:25,151
You have a conveniently
discriminating anatomy.

211
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:28,545
Who would've thought you kept your
heart swung there so you might lose it?

212
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:34,714
Why, you shriveled old winesack!
Have you never lost your heart?

213
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,059
Me? No.

214
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:48,471
Never. But I knew a man
once who did. But me, never.

215
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:53,099
Hear this love story.

216
00:19:56,226 --> 00:20:00,094
There was this man.

217
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,934
This noble man...

218
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:09,382
who lost his heart. He loved
a girl who came from nothing.

219
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:17,049
came with beauty as beautiful as,
whatever you think is beautiful.

220
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:24,333
And he was a great man.
Without fear, he taken her.

221
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:30,517
But he was a great man because he
was a man of honor. So he married her.

222
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:33,559
Knowing not whence she came.

223
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:40,339
He gave her his name,
as well his love...

224
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,756
...with honor.

225
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,350
One day, hunting,

226
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:50,298
she was trip from the horse.

227
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,392
And there in the full light of day...

228
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,975
he saw her naked shoulder.

229
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:58,425
He saw the branded mark of harlot.

230
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:02,100
A thief, placed there.

231
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:05,717
His angel bore his name and
the mark of dishonor together.

232
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:11,845
Whore, murderers or worst
burned into her shoulder.

233
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:19,930
He...

234
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:23,099
saw it.

235
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:26,719
He...

236
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,304
What?

237
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,929
I think that she is...

238
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:39,012
...dead.

239
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:47,008
I would hope she died, wouldn't you?

240
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,258
Poor man.

241
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,800
Poor dishonored man.

242
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:59,059
Well!

243
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,087
That's the story to cure your love.

244
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,081
It takes a love story
to cure you of love.

245
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:09,511
Of fascinating women.

246
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:17,596
Tell me something. Is your
Milady as beautiful as the dew?

247
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:24,718
She's as magnificent as
summer's dew. As that.

248
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,600
I'd beg of you, forget her,
she will do you some mischief.

249
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:33,963
Yes, you're right. And besides,
I owe it to my Constance.

250
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:39,550
I shall remain faithful to her.

251
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:51,309
- Monsieur D'Artagnan!
- Kitty! Your mistress is well today?

252
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,209
- Well indeed, sir, but not here.
- Not here? But she said four o'clock.

253
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,516
Yes, but before four she went
out, to take the air. / The air?

254
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:04,428
Why would she do that?

255
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,767
What a pretty flower!

256
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:10,934
She doesn't love you at all.

257
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:12,392
She told you that?

258
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:20,136
Oh, no. But, I have seen
Milady and men before.

259
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:30,184
But why do you tell me this?

260
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:35,309
- Because I have my own interest.
- You? You, Kitty?

261
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,708
But of course, what
else could one expect?

262
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,475
Dear child.

263
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:58,094
Now then, we have ten
minutes before Milady return.

264
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:10,305
We're here.

265
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:14,472
Thank you, Milady.

266
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:17,091
Bloody arm.

267
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:19,471
Kitty?

268
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:24,968
- She has put a weight on.
- Why didn't she get a horse?

269
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,888
Kitty?

270
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:34,799
Kitty!

271
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,634
- Were you asleep?
- I was resting.

272
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:43,969
Thank you.

273
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:50,184
- Has our Gascon been and gone?
- No, Milady.

274
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:53,259
He did not come.

275
00:24:57,268 --> 00:25:03,406
Perhaps with the army going to La
Rochelle, he's been detained by duty.

276
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:09,976
Possibly. It maybe necesarry to
teach Monsieur D'Artagnan manners,

277
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,059
before we've done with him.

278
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,904
- What will you do with him, Milady?
- Who should say?

279
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:21,714
It was pleasant to be
adore by one so pretty.

280
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:25,214
In time, Rochefort will
cut him to death by inches.

281
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,384
Perhaps I should watch.

282
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,474
As for his dressmaker...

283
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,385
Rochefort grooms will have her.

284
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:42,010
I should wear this tonight.

285
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,346
Stay there!

286
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,258
Thank you!

287
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,849
No...

288
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:57,517
Where is Constance Bonacieux?

289
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:03,638
Quickly! Unless you want this bed to be
your deathbed. Where is she? / Wait.

290
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,596
Try that again and I'll cut some
fleur de lis and the rest of you!

291
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:57,803
- Quickly, Kitty! Give me that cloak!
- Kitty! Open the door!

292
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:03,926
But...

293
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:08,131
Excuse me, sir.
Stop! Come back, sir!

294
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,940
Kitty opens the door!

295
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,714
I think your mistress is calling.

296
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:15,673
But that's the window...

297
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,975
Hello, hello.

298
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,725
Hey.

299
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,883
- Thank you, Madame.
- Move along, please.

300
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:26,093
Kitty!

301
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:28,176
Oh, well.

302
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:34,264
Kitty! Open the door!

303
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:02,100
Bad luck, Aramis!

304
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:08,335
Shoe shine! Anyone
wants shoes shine, sir?

305
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:11,305
Shoe shine?

306
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:19,219
- D'Artagnan! Lend me some money!
- Wine!

307
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,347
I need some wine!

308
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:30,721
Ah, thank you.

309
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,253
Where did you get this?

310
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,677
Milady.

311
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:48,391
Your story,
the brand of fleur de lis...

312
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,845
It was her?

313
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:56,266
Oh God.
I'd hoped that she was dead.

314
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:04,889
This has been in our family for
generations before I gave it to her.

315
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:14,017
Those other two must
not know, alright? / Yes.

316
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:19,550
So she has return to haunt me.

317
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:22,052
And you.

318
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:25,850
Because you've done something she'll
never forgive. You found out her secret.

319
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,632
She won't let you live, boy.

320
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,845
She has tried in that line already.

321
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:38,059
Leave now.

322
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:44,215
Leave Paris, leave France. Get as far
from that evil woman's grasp as you can.

323
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,267
How about you?

324
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:51,760
I'm safe. She does not
know that Athos exist.

325
00:31:54,685 --> 00:32:01,053
If you stay, your life will be
worthless. Do you understand?

326
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:06,217
No. You forget, there's
still Constance to be found.

327
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:10,093
That tumbling trot of a dressmaker?

328
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,718
If you please! I love her.

329
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,475
I think.

330
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,475
I shall ask the Queen
for help in finding her.

331
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:21,892
And as for the branded
lady and her vengeance:

332
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:27,846
Our regiment leaves again for La Rochelle
tomorrow. That's far enough to be safe.

333
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:36,234
- Where away, musketeer?
- The Queen.

334
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:40,758
Her Majesty isn't receiving,
but the Cardinal is.

335
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:50,600
D'Artagnan of Gascony.
You'd been describe as a swordsman.

336
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,225
That is kindness.

337
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:55,797
- As an intriguer.
- There's that, in all of us.

338
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,335
- As an enemy.
- I'm honored to have you as an enemy.

339
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,059
I?

340
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,684
I have no enemies.
Only those in France.

341
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:11,943
But I do seem to be continually
beset by enemies who wear your coat.

342
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:18,167
You wear my coat.
Serve France, as I do.

343
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:21,388
I'm offering you a
commissioned in my guard.

344
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,167
These enemies are the
enemies of France.

345
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,294
Root them out under my protection.

346
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:30,805
Wear my coat. Have my love.

347
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:38,220
Eminence, what can I say?

348
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:41,344
"Yes" will be sufficient.

349
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:45,095
I can't.

350
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:48,017
You're very wet.

351
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:52,975
Wet or dry, I cannot.

352
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:58,176
Take my hand. Your fortune
is secured. / No, I can't!

353
00:34:58,177 --> 00:35:04,963
I do not withdraw my hand.
It is held out to you openly.

354
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:08,725
In it lies your future.
Take it.

355
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,429
No.

356
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:18,957
Are you going to the siege
of La Rochelle? / I do.

357
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,642
You will find it a perilous journey.

358
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,434
I bear you no ill will,

359
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,836
- But I can give you no protection.
- I asked for none.

360
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:32,134
I shall not lift a finger to save you.

361
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,177
I deeply regret that I can
not accept your service.

362
00:35:36,726 --> 00:35:39,642
I don't make such an
offer twice in one day.

363
00:35:39,643 --> 00:35:42,943
But if you should survive
to return to Paris,

364
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:46,746
you may see my hand stretched
out to you once more.

365
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:51,676
For then, you would be a very
remarkable young man indeed.

366
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:55,137
I would remark on it to people.

367
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:58,599
Goodbye.

368
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,835
The young fool refused Richelieu
offer of a commissioned.

369
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:15,672
Which now makes him fair
game as far as your concern.

370
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,711
He's conceit.

371
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:19,638
No!

372
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:26,628
We should oblige D'Artagnan & make sure
that his journey is an eventful one.

373
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:29,642
That's easily arrange.

374
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:32,251
The Musketeers regiment
leave Paris tomorrow.

375
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:36,350
They serve as couriers on
their march to La Rochelle.

376
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:40,337
D'Artagnan and his friends
frequently travel in small groups.

377
00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:44,290
There should be no difficulty
to entertain them along the road.

378
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:49,172
Excelent. And the woman, Bonacieux?

379
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:54,725
The lady is enjoying the hospitality
of my guards at my chateau Saint-Cloud.

380
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:58,551
It would seem they are
most anxious to pander...

381
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:02,343
to her creature comfort.
So she is in safe hands.

382
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:03,809
Never fear.

383
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:09,846
The Queen will need a new dressmaker
whenever you agree to say so.

384
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:32,725
At Saint-Cloud?

385
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:36,303
I know he'll kill her,
if Milady says so.

386
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,626
And she'll do anything
to bill revenge on you.

387
00:37:38,627 --> 00:37:41,934
I'll have her out of here this night.

388
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:46,960
- But where can I take her to safety?
- To the convent of Armentières.

389
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:50,434
But Rochefort's men are
sure to be expecting you.

390
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,500
Let us rescue your mistress. It's the
very least one can do for a friend.

391
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,753
If she can stay with the Sisters
while we're at La Rochelle...

392
00:37:57,754 --> 00:38:00,517
I'm sure they'll learn a
great deal from each other.

393
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:04,962
I'll cover for you and we will
meet again within three days.

394
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:09,969
See if you can find a way to
console yourself until our return.

395
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:34,775
Aramis!

396
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:36,756
Forgive me!

397
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:40,221
Don't let him get the key!

398
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,889
Do not let him get it!

399
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:47,471
We need it!

400
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,975
Go to the window!

401
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:08,100
Hello, my dear. Would you like
to climb on my shoulders?

402
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,221
There he is!

403
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,767
Come on, my dear.
Quickly, here we are.

404
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:06,225
- Yes!
- Sister. Be good.

405
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:11,516
The problems of the siege of
La Rochelle has been immense.

406
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,424
Mainly because nobody
would listen to me.

407
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:16,809
For example:

408
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,341
I should deploy the
siege towers at dawn.

409
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,809
No, no. Before dawn.

410
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,258
Good evening. See any
musketeers yet? / Not yet.

411
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,882
There's a parcel of letter for
you on the table. They came today.

412
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:33,559
Unfortunately, my superiors...

413
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,806
do not appreciate my strategy.
Love, your...

414
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:42,385
What's it say?

415
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:51,132
This writing is bound to be
indistinct. Perhaps you could...

416
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:57,860
"Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Monsieur Athos, Porthos and Aramis...

417
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:03,614
arrived at my inn. "
It's from the innkeeper of Villoix.

418
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:09,684
"And having dine & drunk, became noisy,
the marshal lock them up for a few days.

419
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:14,426
They asked me to send you a dozen bottle
of my Anjou wine to drink their health. "

420
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:19,475
Now, that's what I call real friendship.
To think of me when they're drunk.

421
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:27,049
No. The least I can do is to bail
them out, and we drink these together.

422
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:47,346
What did I do?

423
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:43,725
Who the devil would fight
out of door in this weather?

424
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,999
- Only a lunatic.
- D'Artagnan might be involved?

425
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,724
Anyone else on this road?

426
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:35,220
That one.

427
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:39,554
And there.

428
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:26,601
Don't worry. I'm coming. I help...

429
00:45:32,685 --> 00:45:35,391
- Take me with you!
- Out of my way!

430
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:38,381
Help me!

431
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,100
Are you hurt?

432
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:02,559
- No, no.
- Good, come along.

433
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,499
Aramis, this one is still alive.
We'll take him with us.

434
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,219
He can sing us a song about
Milady's plot, no doubt.

435
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:15,761
What about me?

436
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:18,552
I might've freeze!

437
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,850
- What do you think?
- Nothing.

438
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,593
We were supposed to go to Red
Dovecote inn near La Rochelle.

439
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:34,316
Oh, God, my arm!

440
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:37,005
I know nothing more, I swear! No names!

441
00:46:37,006 --> 00:46:38,392
Planchet!

442
00:46:38,393 --> 00:46:41,934
- Brandy!
- Come on, now! Bustle!

443
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:46,016
Here's your wine of Anjou.
That will do.

444
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:53,257
A drink, in the name of God. A drink.

445
00:46:55,851 --> 00:47:03,049
Am I to die of thirst and
cold while this footpad cuddle?

446
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:06,341
- What? Are you mad?
- Look!

447
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:18,309
I always had my doubts
about the Anjou '22.

448
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,834
- Where did this wine come from?
- Why, you sent them!

449
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:23,809
It came today with a note
from the landlord of Villoix.

450
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,797
- We sent you no wine.
- But we can guess who did.

451
00:47:26,798 --> 00:47:29,817
An ambush on the road.
Poisoned wine.

452
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:32,725
It occurs to me that
Milady is tenacious.

453
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:38,434
The sooner we get to the field
Battle of La Rochelle, the better.

454
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:42,681
Red Dovecote inn.

455
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:49,882
- I think they're disgusting.
- Do try one, Majesty.

456
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:06,504
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.

457
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:12,506
Look down on these sinners hanging.

458
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,471
Cardinal!

459
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,636
- La Rochelle has fallen, eh?
- Not quite, Sire.

460
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:37,807
The pigeon has reach
the Dovecote, Eminence.

461
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,059
Eminence!

462
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,682
Yes, it's here.

463
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:21,357
Either your priestly intention
above all the saint on your side,

464
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,850
or you're cheating.

465
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:27,434
- It is a matter of faith.
- Your faith is costing me money.

466
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:33,124
All this evening spend at this place,
just because a rascal mention its name.

467
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,097
What are we waiting?

468
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,638
Richelieu!

469
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:45,174
What the devil does he want here?

470
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:53,088
- No one knows you're here?
- The landlord has been well paid.

471
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:57,642
Yes. How, Milady.

472
00:49:57,643 --> 00:50:02,253
What you will do for your pay:
A ship waiting at the river mouth.

473
00:50:02,254 --> 00:50:04,559
You will board it tonight. In London...

474
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,419
you will urge the Duke of Buckingham
not to assist the rebels.

475
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,089
No food, no aid, no
English fleet to the rescue.

476
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,934
Assure him from me, that if he does,

477
00:50:14,935 --> 00:50:19,845
he is at war with France, a war
he dare not fight, can not win.

478
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,475
More than that,

479
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:25,059
The Queen of France,
for whom he bears love...

480
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:32,720
my word on this, as sure as I love, will
be dragged out and paraded in dishonor.

481
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:37,059
And if he will not heed you?

482
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,639
Then we must pray that the
Duke mixed with an accident.

483
00:50:44,268 --> 00:50:45,725
I see.

484
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:50,585
Naturally, you will
urge him to see wisdom.

485
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:55,132
Bon voyage, Milady.

486
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:58,347
I'm not to be paid in money.

487
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:00,725
You are not?

488
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:03,600
I have affairs to be settled.

489
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:06,505
I'm not concerned with your affairs.

490
00:51:06,506 --> 00:51:08,309
I would wish it.

491
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,679
I'm not concerned with
your wishes, Milady.

492
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:16,975
But you may name your
own price, obviously.

493
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,184
A death.

494
00:51:20,185 --> 00:51:24,684
I will not assist in
your private murders.

495
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:27,559
I need no assistance.

496
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,892
I need only your signature that I might
have carte blanche, a signed warrant...

497
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:36,424
for disposal of the life of the
slut Bonacieux and her lover.

498
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:39,767
No.

499
00:51:39,768 --> 00:51:41,892
Eminence.

500
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:45,757
The death of Buckingham for the
death of D'Artagnan. Their lives...

501
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:48,426
for the sake of France.

502
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:13,721
- Well?
- Find D'Artagnan and stay with him.

503
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:14,517
And you?

504
00:52:14,518 --> 00:52:18,469
- I'll follow as soon as I can.
- Be careful.

505
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:35,017
What do you want? Who are you?
How dare you?

506
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:37,511
The Gascon was right.

507
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:40,759
You're still beautiful.

508
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:49,049
Comte de la Fere!

509
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,888
Oh, no, milady.

510
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:54,757
The Comte de la Fere has died.

511
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:57,225
You killed me years ago.

512
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,350
Do you remember?

513
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:02,684
Hunting in the field.

514
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:05,177
On a summer's day.

515
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,304
I'm so stigmatized like you.

516
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:16,224
What do you want of me?
There's nothing between us.

517
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,135
Thank God.

518
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:24,834
But there might be, you see.

519
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,261
I know you.

520
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:32,141
I know what past here, just now.

521
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:36,684
And you mark this.

522
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:40,335
You kill Buckingham or have him
killed, it's no matter to me.

523
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:42,767
He's an Englishman and an enemy.

524
00:53:42,768 --> 00:53:46,184
But you touch one hair
of D'Artagnan's head...

525
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:51,510
and I swear, as God is my judge, I'll
break you on the wheel with my own hand.

526
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,304
No.

527
00:53:56,185 --> 00:53:58,934
Monsieur D'Artagnan...

528
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,725
has assaulted me, insulted me...

529
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:06,174
Since when has it been possible
to insult you, Madame?

530
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,510
And he will die for it.

531
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:20,092
Have you ever seen a
woman shot in the stomach?

532
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:26,017
You know me, Milady.

533
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:29,304
Give me the papers the
Cardinal wrote just now.

534
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:33,636
I'll give you five seconds.

535
00:54:36,435 --> 00:54:40,847
Very well.

536
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:48,142
One, two,

537
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:51,180
three, four...

538
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:10,382
"By my order and for
the good of the state,

539
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:20,760
the bearer has done what
has been done. Richelieu. "

540
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:28,434
Clever and subtle man,
our dear Cardinal.

541
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:33,428
It gives you what you want without
leaving evidence against himself.

542
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:39,554
Unfortunately you won't have time to
send messages before your ship leaves.

543
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:51,346
Bon voyage.

544
00:56:26,726 --> 00:56:29,713
The outer bastion is cleared of rebels.

545
00:56:29,714 --> 00:56:32,966
But it's to hot to hold.

546
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,309
Fairly seven o'clock.

547
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:40,434
We'll try a full frontal
assault at nine. Or at ten.

548
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:45,558
- A musketeer! Where have you been?
- Good day, gentlemen.

549
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:50,932
Boy! Quickly!

550
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,639
- Look here!
- Get off!

551
00:56:57,476 --> 00:57:00,099
Thank you very much.

552
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:14,331
Where is the Gascon?
We have to speak to him, quickly.

553
00:57:14,332 --> 00:57:17,017
Over there, in the trenches.

554
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:22,426
A conference? But where?
We can't keep a secret here.

555
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:27,007
The eyes and ears around here
belongs to the Cardinal.

556
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:29,475
Right. Where can we go?

557
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:33,755
More work, gentlemen.
And where were the musketeers?

558
00:57:33,756 --> 00:57:36,707
At our prayes, sir.
Like good christians.

559
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:39,059
So as I, and for a good reason.

560
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,069
That bastion was buzzing
like a beehive.

561
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,510
And yet, you did not
stay for to breakfast.

562
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:48,804
Neither would you.

563
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:55,631
Would you bet on that?

564
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:59,682
I'll wager you...

565
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:05,712
the finest dinner on this camp, we
will have breakfast on that bastion...

566
00:58:05,713 --> 00:58:08,052
now.

567
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,100
Done! Done!

568
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:18,004
You hear that, Spengler. We're going to
eat that big dinner alone. /What is it?

569
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:23,142
Our good friend Athos, proposed to
have us killed for breakfast. Up there.

570
00:58:23,143 --> 00:58:28,809
Planchet! Bring bread, four chickens,
ham, oysters and wine. Right now!

571
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,755
And make the wine champagne.

572
00:58:31,756 --> 00:58:34,600
For breakfast? Oh, my dear Porthos!

573
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:38,848
- Planchet! Money, money, money...
- You can't afford some!

574
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:44,631
- Thistles!
- A long way to go for breakfast!

575
00:58:44,632 --> 00:58:47,597
Is not that right, Athos?

576
00:58:49,435 --> 00:58:55,139
Over there! Don't you see? Someone
approaches the bastion! Fire!

577
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:03,225
Hurry! I'll cover you! Quick!

578
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:09,475
There!

579
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:12,099
Take cover, Planchet!

580
00:59:12,185 --> 00:59:14,761
All right?

581
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:19,961
Why do we always have to attack uphill?

582
00:59:19,962 --> 00:59:23,179
I'm getting too old for this.

583
00:59:28,435 --> 00:59:33,380
I got something important to
tell you! / You have to speak up!

584
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:38,758
You three up there!
Get those things ready!

585
00:59:47,643 --> 00:59:51,427
At last, we got the
cance to talk in peace.

586
00:59:58,185 --> 01:00:02,333
Here is your wine, now.
It's an ideal temperature.

587
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:05,887
Come on. Open it, Planchet!

588
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,055
Damned pirate landlord!
This isn't champagne!

589
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:18,100
This wine does not travel well.

590
01:00:18,101 --> 01:00:22,767
You saw her with the Cardinal?
And she's going to murder Buckingham?

591
01:00:22,768 --> 01:00:29,183
If necessary. And knowing Buckingham,
it probably will be. Give me some!

592
01:00:32,435 --> 01:00:37,049
A moment, gentlemen!
We're in the middle of our breakfast!

593
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:42,600
Barbarians, have they no manners?

594
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:46,299
We can't allow Buckingham to be
butchered! / Why? He is on their side.

595
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,017
Precisely. And he's English!

596
01:00:48,018 --> 01:00:51,964
No! He's a gallant gentleman.
And he loves our Queen.

597
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:56,100
I won't sit by and allow
him to be murdered by that...

598
01:00:56,101 --> 01:01:00,684
She also has a death warrant signed
against you and Madame Bonacieux.

599
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:05,630
Here, read this with your breakfast
and tuck it safely in your boot.

600
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:10,094
Fire!

601
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,184
Wrong.

602
01:01:13,185 --> 01:01:20,347
It would be better to wringing Milady
than shooting these devils Protestants.

603
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:27,609
What are we killing them for? Because
they sing psalms in French & we in Latin?

604
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:32,675
Porthos, have you no education? What do
you think religious wars are all about?

605
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:44,174
Here they come!
Make your shot count!

606
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:49,799
Hurry up, Planchet.
Load that.

607
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:12,470
Come on, Planchet.
Use both hands.

608
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,554
A loaf of bread!

609
01:03:35,893 --> 01:03:37,888
Mine!

610
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:51,091
What a waste!

611
01:03:51,185 --> 01:03:53,761
I do apologize.

612
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,225
Quick, here! The wall!

613
01:04:09,226 --> 01:04:14,765
Push! Push for your lives!

614
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,392
Excuse me, gentlemen.

615
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:22,632
Push, Porthos! Exert yourself!

616
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:45,342
Athos! About Buckingham, I ought
to warn the Queen! / Later!

617
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:47,958
Gentlemen, I suggest
we get out of here!

618
01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:49,600
Take!

619
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:52,094
Thank you very much, sir.

620
01:04:56,435 --> 01:05:00,183
Could you give me a hand?

621
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:04,382
Can you help?

622
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:06,846
The basket.

623
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:09,760
Can you?

624
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:12,888
Take for it!

625
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:43,309
Come back soon. Don't get killed.

626
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:47,458
Come back and pay it,
or we will find you.

627
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:51,095
Nice to see them back again.

628
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:56,753
Here we are. / Well done,
D'Artagnan. And Athos, come.

629
01:05:56,754 --> 01:06:00,086
It know it against our
principles, but have a drink!

630
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:02,850
And Aramis! Even you. Well done.

631
01:06:02,851 --> 01:06:07,098
Here's your money. Now go and
fill your fat royalist belly.

632
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:14,642
Your journey has been in vain.

633
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:20,841
Inform His Eminence, I'm not to be
persuaded by his threats or beauty.

634
01:06:20,842 --> 01:06:24,465
I will take English ships to help
the Protestants of La Rochelle.

635
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:26,392
Tell the Cardinal.

636
01:06:26,393 --> 01:06:31,517
I trust you do not live to
regret it, Milord Buckingham.

637
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:10,434
Trust to the Cardinal to employ
every diplomatic argument.

638
01:07:10,435 --> 01:07:15,507
At least it relieves my conscience
of any doubts in assisting the rebels.

639
01:07:15,508 --> 01:07:17,546
I shall inform His Eminence.

640
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,475
Lady, you'll inform no one!

641
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:25,959
You came here as an ambassadress, but
by God, you'll stay here as an assassin!

642
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,475
- You will not dare.
- Oh, no?

643
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:33,059
A week lodging in a congenial
riverside establishment. The tower.

644
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:37,753
And after I've sails with my fleet
to France, you will set sails to.

645
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:41,003
To His Majesty's colony in America.

646
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:42,850
America!

647
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:47,047
They say it is full
of beautiful savages.

648
01:07:47,048 --> 01:07:50,350
Who knows, once there, maybe
you'll be able to use that...

649
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:53,509
astonishing beauty to persuade
someone to bring you home again.

650
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,559
But don't count on it, in the meantime.

651
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,170
I have a jailer for you who can't see
beauty even when it is astonished you.

652
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:05,846
He can't be melted. Felton!

653
01:08:06,976 --> 01:08:08,600
Milord?

654
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:12,350
Milady is going to the tower, Felton.
At your charge.

655
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:16,432
She is to see no one else.

656
01:08:58,685 --> 01:09:01,094
Good sir?

657
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:06,295
In this place, may I be granted
the comfort of Gods words?

658
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:09,893
A Bible. And the Psalms.

659
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,136
Are you not a Roman?

660
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,725
No.

661
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:19,559
No, sir.

662
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,968
I am a Huguenot. Those were prosecuted
for their Protestant's faith.

663
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:38,176
This is mine.

664
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:43,165
I sall bring you the Psalms tomorrow.

665
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:46,092
God bless you, sir!

666
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:18,127
The Cardinal sent that
woman to England...

667
01:10:18,128 --> 01:10:20,262
...to kill?

668
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:24,721
Oh, no.

669
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,434
He must be warn!

670
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:30,840
- You go, D'Artagnan!
- It not possible, Your Majesty.

671
01:10:30,841 --> 01:10:34,142
I can not leave my regiment with
the Cardinal's spies are everywhere.

672
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:40,132
But I have a servant to go and warn
Buckingham, if you write a message.

673
01:10:50,643 --> 01:10:55,217
- I owe you so much, D'Artagnan.
- No, Majesty.

674
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:58,347
Majesty, the King is waiting!

675
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,860
One glad piece of news, I do have.

676
01:11:01,861 --> 01:11:04,184
Constance Bonacieux is safe.

677
01:11:04,185 --> 01:11:07,670
She is at the Cecilia convent,
near Armentieres.

678
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:11,216
As soon as I'm free of the siege,
I'll go and bring her back to Paris.

679
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:14,180
Madame, the King!

680
01:11:20,351 --> 01:11:22,892
Save him for me.

681
01:11:24,768 --> 01:11:28,170
God bless you, D'Artagnan.
And please have your servant hurry...

682
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:30,724
to England.

683
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:58,014
This is the best I could
get for the money.

684
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:10,466
Do not let your foot be moved;
or numb the...

685
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:15,165
Lord is your protector;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right...

686
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:19,726
The sun shall not smite you
by day, nor the moon by night.

687
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:24,252
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.

688
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:27,467
Jehovah preserve thy going
out and thy coming...

689
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,934
...now and forever.

690
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:33,781
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

691
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,494
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

692
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:39,705
Do not allow your foot
nor slumber that keepeth thee...

693
01:12:39,706 --> 01:12:43,348
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

694
01:12:43,851 --> 01:12:49,011
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

695
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:17,777
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

696
01:13:17,778 --> 01:13:22,716
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

697
01:13:22,717 --> 01:13:26,191
...nor he that keepeth thee slumber.
Behold, he is numb...

698
01:13:26,192 --> 01:13:30,097
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.

699
01:13:37,556 --> 01:13:43,130
When they cry,
the Lord hear it...

700
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:47,763
and delivers them
from all their troubles.

701
01:13:48,015 --> 01:13:51,550
The Lord is near...

702
01:13:52,931 --> 01:13:55,507
Amen.

703
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:25,305
Master Felton.

704
01:14:25,306 --> 01:14:29,334
For two nights I do not sleep.

705
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:33,264
When I am awake, I am nearer to God.

706
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:38,507
God is with thee,
awake or asleep, Milady.

707
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:09,341
Help me!

708
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:13,293
God, help me! Help my
people from prosecution!

709
01:15:13,294 --> 01:15:16,663
Deliver them from the
betrayal, the antichrist,

710
01:15:16,664 --> 01:15:18,805
so as not to corrupt and destroy..

711
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:22,671
as he has defiled and destroyed me.
Send me thy angel, God...

712
01:15:22,672 --> 01:15:27,430
to strike down Thy enemies!
Help me! Help me!

713
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:29,430
Who is the antichrist, the betrayal?

714
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:32,881
Your master, the Duke of Buckingham.

715
01:15:32,882 --> 01:15:36,763
He is the Philistine blight on Israel.

716
01:15:37,098 --> 01:15:41,472
You are a Puritan and yet,
you serve him.

717
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:47,847
They are dying in La Rochelle for the
faith and he is betraying them. / No!

718
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:54,414
- No! He's going to save them.
- He deceives the world & will betray.

719
01:15:54,415 --> 01:16:00,503
He marches to Paris, to the bed of
his Queen, his lascivious Roman Queen.

720
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:06,055
Help me, master Felton.
You have the eyes of a saint.

721
01:16:06,056 --> 01:16:09,924
Help me to warn our people.

722
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:14,038
I can not think.

723
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:16,252
Help me.

724
01:17:12,848 --> 01:17:14,722
Felton,

725
01:17:14,723 --> 01:17:17,889
you will not let this
treachery go unpunished.

726
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:22,334
It is in God's hands.
His will be done. / Yes.

727
01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:24,378
Let it be done.

728
01:17:30,223 --> 01:17:33,889
Then the dragon was
wroth with the women;

729
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:38,718
and went to make war with
the remnant of her seed.

730
01:17:43,515 --> 01:17:48,173
Aye, ten pence.
Good steel, too.

731
01:17:48,174 --> 01:17:53,471
Your change, sir!

732
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:32,889
Lord Buckingham!

733
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:03,540
Seems that Lord Buckingham
not going to leave England.

734
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:06,878
My congratulations.

735
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:29,121
I reek of England and Calvinism.

736
01:19:29,122 --> 01:19:31,139
The Cardinal's business is done.

737
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:37,377
I may devote myself to my own.
To St. Cloud and the woman, Bonacieux.

738
01:19:38,515 --> 01:19:42,461
No. She is in the Cecilia
convent in Armentieres.

739
01:19:42,462 --> 01:19:46,139
One of my men went after her
but the fool bungle it, somewhat.

740
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:15,889
Sorry.

741
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:21,215
And D'Artagnan? / La Rochelle
surrendered three days ago.

742
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:36,423
So, Sire, La Rochelle has fallen.

743
01:20:36,424 --> 01:20:38,597
And not before time.

744
01:20:38,598 --> 01:20:42,829
- What you going to spend, Porthos?
- After paying the drink...

745
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:46,332
for Athos and Aramis pardons,
will not be too much.

746
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:49,386
Don't forget the needy.

747
01:20:49,556 --> 01:20:52,761
Come on. Constance is in danger!

748
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:57,833
They were on the road to
Armentières to claim his lady love.

749
01:20:57,834 --> 01:21:01,711
Don't worry, they can not possibly
be closer than Paris by now.

750
01:21:01,712 --> 01:21:04,583
We may be in Armentières at dawn.

751
01:21:04,584 --> 01:21:07,421
I've twelve men at
the convent already...

752
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:13,333
so we can assure D'Artagnan
a most heartly welcome.

753
01:21:13,334 --> 01:21:19,676
And you will have them all, Milady.

754
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:48,840
Welcome, welcome, Musketeers!

755
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:52,001
These poor beasts are done, Athos.

756
01:21:52,002 --> 01:21:54,222
Not only the poor beasts.

757
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:57,328
How far is the Cecilia
convent? / Two miles!

758
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,718
Up the Brussels road.

759
01:22:02,473 --> 01:22:05,505
We're almost there.

760
01:22:05,506 --> 01:22:08,969
Time for a glass of wine!

761
01:22:09,056 --> 01:22:14,963
Then we'll escort you to your
heart desire. Wine! Come on!

762
01:22:19,223 --> 01:22:23,387
To quench a Gascon.

763
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:36,067
Hey, stop!

764
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:38,802
Quickly!

765
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:46,343
Athos!

766
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:51,799
Athos! He's here!

767
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:56,125
Rochefort! He saw me! Come on!

768
01:22:56,126 --> 01:22:59,094
After him!

769
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:03,630
Come on! Quick!

770
01:23:03,631 --> 01:23:06,344
After them!

771
01:23:09,348 --> 01:23:15,882
After them! Quick!

772
01:23:20,556 --> 01:23:23,512
There's no saddle on that horse!

773
01:23:51,931 --> 01:23:55,005
There it is!

774
01:24:12,556 --> 01:24:15,298
Steady, Gascon!

775
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:19,342
There's another way in.

776
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:34,722
Take her inside! Go to the
barn! They're close behind!

777
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:45,625
Find the girl!
I'll take care of the riders!

778
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:48,046
They're coming!

779
01:24:48,047 --> 01:24:51,011
Fire at will!

780
01:24:56,473 --> 01:24:59,511
They come from behind!

781
01:25:08,306 --> 01:25:11,463
Don't let them get away! Fire!

782
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:50,508
Aramis!

783
01:26:04,348 --> 01:26:06,426
Fire!

784
01:27:21,973 --> 01:27:24,252
Thank you!

785
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,501
Come on, Rochefort!

786
01:28:07,502 --> 01:28:09,675
Come on!

787
01:29:12,223 --> 01:29:15,546
- Aramis!
- Porthos!

788
01:29:19,223 --> 01:29:21,632
Aramis!

789
01:29:22,015 --> 01:29:24,045
Quickly!

790
01:30:10,265 --> 01:30:15,887
...lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

791
01:30:18,431 --> 01:30:20,222
What is it, sister?

792
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:24,087
My child.
Have no fear. Keep praying.

793
01:30:24,088 --> 01:30:27,249
- The shooting...
- Will soon be over.

794
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:30,265
I'm a friend.
Soon you will be free.

795
01:30:30,266 --> 01:30:33,246
- Monsieur D'Artagnan...
- He's here!

796
01:30:33,247 --> 01:30:36,014
He will see you in a moment.

797
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:40,542
Go on with your prayers.
You should say a prayer for him.

798
01:30:40,543 --> 01:30:44,514
- And the gallant gentelemen with him.
- Yes.

799
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:50,548
- Is he truly here, sister?
- He will not leave except with you.

800
01:30:50,549 --> 01:30:53,298
So...

801
01:30:53,806 --> 01:30:56,347
I shall wait with you.

802
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:14,972
"Only Porthos could invent a
new way to disarm himself. "

803
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,177
Get away!

804
01:31:47,473 --> 01:31:50,889
Child, you mustn't cry.

805
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:54,639
You must look your best for D'Artagnan.

806
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:56,676
Yes.

807
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:29,679
- Why is it always have to be me?
- You're getting old.

808
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:35,442
Where is Rochefort?

809
01:32:35,443 --> 01:32:39,176
We haven't seen him.

810
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:43,343
Constance!

811
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:47,176
Constance!

812
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:28,173
You won't need a horse on the
journey you're taking, Madame.

813
01:33:28,174 --> 01:33:31,503
I warned you, did I not?

814
01:34:01,848 --> 01:34:06,095
Be advised, Gascon! Turn and run!

815
01:34:07,473 --> 01:34:10,380
You murderer!

816
01:34:26,598 --> 01:34:29,139
Bastard!

817
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:32,295
Stop! Stop fighting!

818
01:37:39,598 --> 01:37:45,504
We are all here as judges.

819
01:37:45,598 --> 01:37:49,003
What is your sentence?

820
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,134
Death.

821
01:37:54,598 --> 01:37:57,470
Death.

822
01:38:02,848 --> 01:38:06,926
Death.

823
01:38:17,723 --> 01:38:21,009
You are the headsman of me.

824
01:38:22,431 --> 01:38:27,674
As the Comte de la Fere with the
rights of high, middle and low justice,

825
01:38:29,056 --> 01:38:33,552
- I want the death of this woman.
- Five pistoles.

826
01:38:55,098 --> 01:38:57,093
D'Artagnan!

827
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:07,347
No!

828
01:39:07,348 --> 01:39:12,172
No! You are not my judges.
Take me before a court! It is my right!

829
01:39:12,173 --> 01:39:14,507
No!

830
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:22,625
You take one more step, D'Artagnan,
and we will cross sword.

831
01:39:22,626 --> 01:39:26,341
I swear to God,
I'll kill you this time.

832
01:40:40,723 --> 01:40:46,096
Two more pistoles for rowing the
boat. I'm a headsman, not a sailor.

833
01:41:05,765 --> 01:41:10,162
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Your sword, please! And yours, too!

834
01:41:10,163 --> 01:41:14,049
In the name his eminence, the Cardinal!

835
01:41:16,098 --> 01:41:20,247
I once held out my hand to you.

836
01:41:20,248 --> 01:41:22,264
I do not do so now.

837
01:41:22,265 --> 01:41:26,378
Now you'll stand trial for the murder
of a valued servant of the state.

838
01:41:26,379 --> 01:41:28,680
I fought Milady de Winter
with their own weapons.

839
01:41:28,681 --> 01:41:32,389
So you did. And won. Rochefort,
too, a very considerable achievement.

840
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:36,254
But your victories are too expensive.
For me and for France.

841
01:41:36,255 --> 01:41:39,800
I hold out France's hand for payment.

842
01:41:40,306 --> 01:41:45,252
I shall not pay one sou, shed one
tear, feel one grain of pity.

843
01:41:45,348 --> 01:41:49,164
Then you must be tried.
You will be condemn.

844
01:41:49,165 --> 01:41:51,347
I think not.

845
01:41:51,348 --> 01:41:53,889
For all that I have done,
I have a proper warrant.

846
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:58,369
Signed by whom? The Queen
can not, King would not.

847
01:41:58,370 --> 01:42:01,463
By your hand, Your Eminence.

848
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,337
By my hand?

849
01:42:10,306 --> 01:42:13,505
"By my hand and for
the good of the state...

850
01:42:13,506 --> 01:42:17,137
the bearer has done
what has been done. "

851
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:24,506
One should be careful what one writes.

852
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:29,588
And to whom one gives it.

853
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:35,555
I must bear those rules in mind.

854
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:40,733
This is commissioned in the King's
musketeer. The name is blank,

855
01:42:40,734 --> 01:42:45,876
but it is to you I give it.
Your friends are free also.

856
01:42:45,877 --> 01:42:49,010
Good day, Monsieur D'Artagnan.

857
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:05,555
Athos,

858
01:43:05,556 --> 01:43:08,805
The Cardinal gave me this.

859
01:43:08,806 --> 01:43:13,800
I can't take it. It should go to you.

860
01:43:15,973 --> 01:43:18,663
For the Comte de la Fère
it is too little,

861
01:43:18,664 --> 01:43:22,498
for Athos, it is too much.
You earned it, child.

862
01:43:22,499 --> 01:43:24,805
Aramis, my dear friend.

863
01:43:24,806 --> 01:43:27,580
You're a man of education, of reading.

864
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:30,597
Please. You're far more
worthy of this than I am.

865
01:43:30,598 --> 01:43:34,047
You forget, I am a
Musketeer only temporarily.

866
01:43:34,048 --> 01:43:36,930
As soon as I find the time, I
intend to be ordain into priesthood.

867
01:43:36,931 --> 01:43:40,764
Look at this. Does it suit
me? / Beautifully, but...

868
01:43:40,765 --> 01:43:44,798
- this would suits you much better.
- Lieutenant!

869
01:43:44,799 --> 01:43:48,797
You flattered me very much. But, no.
One must ask himself...

870
01:43:48,798 --> 01:43:53,298
is the commissioned
something for a gentleman.

871
01:43:53,299 --> 01:43:55,014
But if I'm Lieutenant, I
shall lose all my friends!

872
01:43:55,015 --> 01:43:58,514
A lieutenant is too proud, too
noted for private Musketeers.

873
01:43:58,515 --> 01:44:02,212
Even those who were kind to him when
he first came. Young and foolish.

874
01:44:02,213 --> 01:44:05,162
Running into everyone,
challenge them to fight duels,

875
01:44:05,163 --> 01:44:07,591
making a complete nuisance of himself.

876
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,722
Brawling like a young ruffian with the
Cardinal's guards, while his friends,

877
01:44:11,723 --> 01:44:16,298
older and wiser, trying to restrain
him and keep him out of mischief.

878
01:44:16,299 --> 01:44:21,580
How we guided his faltering, boyish,
foxy, witty, might have gone astray!

879
01:44:21,581 --> 01:44:25,514
We teach the rules high society.

880
01:44:25,515 --> 01:44:28,722
Taught him all of the fine arts
a young gentleman ought to know.

881
01:44:28,723 --> 01:44:35,834
Protected him against enemies and
from temptations of this wicked world.

882
01:44:35,835 --> 01:44:39,415
What would become of him without us?

883
01:44:39,416 --> 01:44:42,434
Or we be without him?

884
01:44:42,435 --> 01:44:45,347
That was from the old days.
When we were indeed:

885
01:44:45,348 --> 01:44:50,258
"One for all and all for one".
