1
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:04,466
THE FOUR MUSKETEERS

2
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:55,559
I remember when they made
Musketeer D'Artagnan to the king.

3
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:59,679
It was a special ceremony.
Came the great personalities,

4
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:01,968
as distinguished
of French society.

5
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,135
Of course, I was there.

6
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:11,262
Who else but me, Aramis and Athos
layer could place it to D'Artagnan?

7
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,393
For the race
of a young person is important

8
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:19,176
be sponsored
by a person of honor and prestige.

9
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:22,511
It gives you confidence in yourself.

10
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,843
The king gave him his blessing,

11
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,261
Queen of course also because

12
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:33,265
D'Artagnan, Aramis,
Athos and I we prevent

13
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:37,672
knew that their relationship
with the Duke of Buckingham.

14
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,215
What a silly woman,

15
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:44,848
looks at fall in love with an Englishman
Prime Minister and over.

16
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,719
D'Artagnan

17
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,559
deserved reward.

18
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:54,220
The four had risked
our life and reputation by it.

19
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:58,346
One of his most dangerous enemy was

20
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,215
Cardinal Richelieu.
A formidable and ambitious man.

21
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:05,015
For the sake of power had even
betrayed and destroyed the Queen.

22
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,384
There was a man of honor.

23
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:11,299
His allies were Lady De Winter
Rochefort and his lover,

24
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:14,968
two wolves in sheep's clothing.

25
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:17,176
She would not forgive him

26
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:22,300
D'Artagnan and his lover Constance
having frustrated their conspiracy.

27
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,640
He wanted revenge.

28
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,642
A terrible woman.

29
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,716
But what mattered to us then
it Rochefort or Cardinal?

30
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,512
We were young and carefree,

31
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,600
Typical Musketeers.

32
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,888
D'Artagnan was in love
Fine dressmaker.

33
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:43,890
And we were very busy fighting
against the Protestants of La Rochelle.

34
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:49,055
We tried to teach the rebels
what is Christian compassion,

35
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,841
bombing them into submission.

36
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,547
These thugs with the idea of ??a
working class as a religion!

37
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:04,844
Even our old enemy
Rochefort spying for us.

38
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,719
With little luck, you see.

39
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:11,759
Fortunately for him and unfortunately for us,
we help you escape.

40
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:18,010
If it was for me,
we would have abandoned to their fate.

41
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:21,429
- This is enough for him.
- We did not know how many.

42
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,513
Lie.

43
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:26,263
Cojan rods load!

44
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,049
Sink the bullets!

45
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:34,924
Shake the rod load!

46
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:40,305
Go back to catch the muskets!

47
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:46,887
Light the wick!

48
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,592
Take away the soot!

49
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,428
Take away a musket insurance!

50
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,469
Have you prepared Porthos horses?

51
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,638
Yes.

52
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,179
Have you prepared the horses?

53
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,345
Yes!

54
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,215
Drop!

55
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:15,180
Place the muskets!

56
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,929
Perhaps you could close one eye.

57
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:21,261
Eleven muskets!

58
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:24,888
Take cover!

59
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,141
The bomb! Quick!

60
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,592
Open the look!

61
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,265
It has been off the wick!

62
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:38,888
Aim!

63
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,596
Fire!

64
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:55,560
Idiots!
Do not know or execute someone?

65
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,475
Go back to load!

66
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:01,300
Why do you trouble her?
At the end will finish dying of old age.

67
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:33,017
Add the horse, Rochefort!
Hurry!

68
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:40,552
- You arrive just in time!
- Who wants to rescue a spy?

69
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,511
Close the door when we come!

70
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,341
The door!

71
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,840
Yes, exactly.

72
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:38,715
Aramis!

73
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,391
Spend less!

74
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,184
Give now!
No, again! Come again!

75
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:17,513
I'd rather die than have to
bring you this news, Your Majesty.

76
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,476
The rebels hope to help

77
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:24,679
fleet of the Duke of Buckingham.

78
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:28,889
- I wish I were dead.
- Me too.

79
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,930
All of us.

80
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:33,177
- My life is in your hands, your Majesty.
- But I do not want it!

81
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,259
I do not want to hear those stories.

82
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:40,934
I want to get successful
in La Rochelle.

83
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:46,759
- The Duke of Buckingham Queen wishes.
- No, Your Majesty.

84
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,715
What he wants is La Rochelle
and will help the rebels.

85
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,341
But the Queen
not betray France.

86
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,099
- In France, no. But to me, yeah.
- But his Majesty is France.

87
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:04,880
Tell the rabble which leaves no
to storm La Rochelle.

88
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:09,594
The walls will collapse soon.
La Rochelle fall.

89
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,682
But it is tedious fight
day to day without success.

90
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,138
Majesty

91
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:20,136
Do you wish to continue here
the siege while his Majesty

92
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,343
returns to Paris with the Queen?

93
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,932
Let us do the dirty work.

94
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:30,138
Yes it's dirty job,
and Queen deceives me.

95
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:34,346
You should consider yourself lucky.

96
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:41,091
I risked life
of my Musketeers to rescue you.

97
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:46,763
Do not do it again.
With two eyes you'd see why.

98
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,264
I like it.

99
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,597
The gratitude of the nobles.

100
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,223
"Spy" is an ugly word.

101
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:02,599
At your service, Eminence,
that word sounds familiar.

102
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:07,384
Kneel down, miserable,

103
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,933
before your master!

104
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:15,475
Listen, Rochefort.

105
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,473
Unfortunately, the Queen
sends love letters to Buckingham.

106
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:23,423
While Buckingham
sends his fleet against France.

107
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:26,761
You'll keep these letters,
retaining the wearer.

108
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:31,172
Constance Bonacieux,
Queen's dressmaker.

109
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:34,760
Then remove it, my son.

110
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,264
But this time I'm not going to rescue.

111
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:41,767
At the end of the day is just a woman.

112
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,017
The goose is young, sir.

113
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,891
And repent.

114
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,595
I do not want.

115
00:10:55,476 --> 00:11:00,762
My mother says that only well
can you tell if fresh.

116
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,221
Peaches!

117
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,596
Are not they beautiful?

118
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,551
Beside you, my dear Constance,
look old and wrinkled.

119
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,013
Melons!

120
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:18,303
Moron.
Who will now pay for this?

121
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:20,638
¿D'Artagnan?

122
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:22,929
D'Artagnan!

123
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,096
Take her away!

124
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:42,679
Get up and fight, you coward!

125
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,759
Poor, poor gentleman

126
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,802
Relay!

127
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,261
Metedlo in the carriage.
But with care.

128
00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:10,923
It hurt.

129
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,642
But Constance ...

130
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,888
Quiet.
I'll take care of you.

131
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:35,558
He is a young
really handsome, Kitty.

132
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:41,589
- Are you awake?
- Who are you?

133
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:44,555
A friend.

134
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,382
Melons for Constance!

135
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,802
- I have to go!
- Do not be foolish.

136
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:54,591
I have to find Constance.

137
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:04,799
Please excuse me.
Such generosity to a stranger.

138
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,642
Lord!

139
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:10,882
Do not you feel good.
You should rest.

140
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,969
Should.

141
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:18,724
But now I have time.
But back

142
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:22,266
to thank you
accordingly.

143
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,141
A very handsome young man.

144
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:20,140
If I had my way,
would have bled to death in the street.

145
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:24,263
But you are a friend.

146
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:30,723
What if we knew
to her friend, the dressmaker?

147
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:35,474
So much beauty wasted
in a ridiculous musketeer.

148
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:40,224
I simply follow orders
Cardinal and entertain.

149
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,805
Is not that what you want the Cardinal?

150
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:46,764
And you as always
enjoy your work.

151
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,427
What do you think, Lord Buckingham?

152
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:22,842
God would have given us wings,
if he wanted to nadásemos.

153
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:29,882
To end the siege of
La Rochelle, we should take boats.

154
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,761
Well ...

155
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:36,172
Your submarine
is a great invention,

156
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:40,637
but how much meat in salt
can lead to the rebels?

157
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:44,965
How many weapons can you carry
Richelieu to end?

158
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:48,053
Here we are!

159
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:54,515
But the submarine is sufficient
to steal the Queen of France.

160
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:59,716
- I do not need to steal the Queen of France.
- No.

161
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:04,474
When the time comes,
waiting for you.

162
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,968
My dear sweet Anne ...

163
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,260
Those damn priests!

164
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,433
Those damn Protestants!

165
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:16,100
Three weeks enduring the rain
in La Rochelle, and for what?

166
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,226
My best dressed
still on the way to Paris.

167
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:23,809
These religious wars. Beatrice,
I'm losing patience!

168
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,673
- Majesty, perhaps this ...
- No!

169
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:29,678
With that look like a pillow exploded.

170
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:33,509
Constance will
make me a new one. Where is it?

171
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:39,517
- Where is the Queen's dressmaker?
- Your Majesty, we can not find it.

172
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:41,054
What do you mean?

173
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:45,133
Two days ago nobody
have seen here or at home.

174
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,434
Has disappeared.

175
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:50,884
Cardinal.

176
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:55,012
What have you done with it?

177
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,674
But where? Where?

178
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:04,380
You say he has been kidnapped? Given ¿
your nose? And there were only four?

179
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:07,684
Losing a lover
normally it's terrible,

180
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:11,011
but her that they take
tucked in a basket

181
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:14,178
is nonsense and almost tasteless.

182
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:19,304
Especially if you already have the
interest of another beautiful girl!

183
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:22,510
Poor Madame Bonacieux
she prefers to be

184
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,809
with the kidnappers.

185
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,014
If It treats me to mine and ...

186
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:29,514
Aramis! Aramis!

187
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,222
Look at my new trick mortal!

188
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:41,048
My enemy will unsheathe the sword,
when suddenly ...

189
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:49,049
Oh, Porthos!

190
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,597
Try again!

191
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,723
Porthos only invent new ways
to disarm itself.

192
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,677
When will you learn?

193
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:09,347
Why would kidnap her?

194
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,635
I do not even listen.

195
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:17,219
- It was a scientific experiment!
- Are you hurt, Athos?

196
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:21,933
No, I'm drunk.

197
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:33,225
You are wounded,

198
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,722
concerned.

199
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,431
You're really worried.

200
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,465
What?

201
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:48,639
- My lover has been kidnapped in my presence ...
- Well.

202
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,768
Do you know where they hide?

203
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,513
- No.
- Well!

204
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:58,555
- I hear you have a new lover.
- No!

205
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,174
Porthos has told me.

206
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:04,345
Do Porthos perhaps a liar?

207
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,094
No.

208
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,430
He talked about an aristocrat
with which you are viewing.

209
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:18,017
No, no!
To her I love her head.

210
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:22,091
But my Constance I was robbed,
I love her with all my heart.

211
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,011
Who would have thought you were going to
steal the heart so easily.

212
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:33,714
Old drunk!
Do you ever stolen your heart?

213
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,596
Me? No.

214
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:47,471
Never. I met a man who
was stolen. But not me, ever.

215
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:52,099
Listen to this love story.

216
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:59,094
There was once a man.

217
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,468
A noble

218
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:08,848
who stole his heart. He loved
a girl who had nothing.

219
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,097
But it was the most beautiful
you can imagine.

220
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:23,799
He was a man of honor.
He could have taken no further.

221
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:29,637
But he was a man of honor.
So he married her.

222
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:33,089
Not knowing where it came from.

223
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,805
He gave his name,
his fortune and his love ...

224
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:42,756
... honorably.

225
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,885
One day, hunting,

226
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,764
she fell off the horse

227
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,933
and he saw

228
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,099
her bare shoulder.

229
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:57,891
He saw the stigma of a prostitute.

230
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:01,634
He had before him a thief.

231
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:05,183
His angel bore his name and at the same time
the mark of disgrace.

232
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:10,845
Prostitute, killed or worse.
Marked on the shoulder.

233
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:18,930
He ..

234
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,099
I had seen.

235
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:25,719
He ..

236
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,304
What?

237
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,929
I think she is ...

238
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,012
... Dead.

239
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:46,474
Hope is dead.
Do not you wish you were him?

240
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:49,258
Poor man.

241
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,800
Poor man dishonored.

242
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,598
Well!

243
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,141
This story
should be cured of love.

244
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,547
You need a love story
to heal.

245
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,511
Of fascinating women.

246
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:16,596
Tell me something. Is your lady
as beautiful as the dew?

247
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:23,718
It's so beautiful
as dew in summer. So beautiful.

248
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,600
Please forget it.
It will bring bad luck.

249
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:33,429
You're right.
In addition, I owe it to Constance.

250
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:38,550
I will be faithful.

251
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:50,844
- Lord D'Artagnan!
- Kitty! How is your wife?

252
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,675
- Good, but not here.
- Is not it? But if he said at four.

253
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:59,516
- He left before four to take the air.
- Is the air?

254
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,428
Why the hell does that?

255
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,305
That pretty flower!

256
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,972
She does not love you at all.

257
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:11,929
Is that what you say?

258
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:19,136
No. But I've seen
my wife with other men.

259
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,723
But why tell me?

260
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:34,309
- Because I have my own interest.
- Do you?, Do you Kitty?

261
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,174
But of course.
¿Sure, I could expect?

262
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,017
My dear girl.

263
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:57,094
We have ten minutes
before my wife again.

264
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,305
We're here.

265
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,472
Thank you very much, Milady.

266
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:17,015
Damn arm.

267
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:18,471
¿Kitty?

268
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:24,434
- He has gained weight.
- Why not buy a horse?

269
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:25,888
¿Kitty?

270
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:33,799
Kitty!

271
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,100
- Were Sleeping?
- I was resting.

272
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,969
Thank you.

273
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:49,511
- Has been our Gascon and is off again?
- No, Milady.

274
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:52,259
He has not come.

275
00:24:57,268 --> 00:25:03,181
May have had
to go with the army to La Rochelle.

276
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:08,976
We may have to teach
Monsieur D'Artagnan manners,

277
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,599
get rid of it before.

278
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,131
- What will you do with it, Milady?
- Who knows?

279
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:21,180
I'm flattered to be adored
by a handsome man.

280
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:24,214
Rochefort end up making you apart.

281
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,384
Maybe I should see it.

282
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,474
In her dressmaker ...

283
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,385
are responsible for the followers of Rochefort.

284
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:41,010
Tonight I put this.

285
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:51,346
Wait!

286
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:59,258
Thank you!

287
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,849
No. ..

288
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:57,058
Where is Constance Bonacieux?

289
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:02,638
- Fast! Or this bed will become your deathbed.
- Wait, wait.

290
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,596
Please try and make you
stigma around the body!

291
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:56,803
- Fast, Kitty! Give me that coat!
- Kitty! Open the door!

292
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,926
But ...

293
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:07,597
Excuse me, sir.
Wait! Come back here!

294
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,513
Kitty opens the door!

295
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:13,180
I think your lady calls.

296
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:14,673
But there ...

297
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,256
Hello, hello.

298
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,255
Hey.

299
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,883
- Thank you.
- Continue, please.

300
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,093
Kitty!

301
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,176
Very good.

302
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:33,264
Kitty! Open the door!

303
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:01,225
Bad luck, Aramis!

304
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:07,801
Shine! Do you want someone who
will wipe the boots? ¿You, sir?

305
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,305
¿To wash boots?

306
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:18,219
- D'Artagnan! Lend money!
- Wine!

307
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,347
I need more wine!

308
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:29,721
Ah, thank you.

309
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:36,719
Where did you get that?

310
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:38,677
Milady.

311
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:47,391
Your story,
the collar, stigma ...

312
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:49,845
Was it?

313
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:55,266
My God.
He hoped she was dead.

314
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:03,889
It belonged to my family for several
generations, until I gave it.

315
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:13,017
- They have not found out, okay?
- If

316
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:19,016
So it has come back to haunt me.

317
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:21,052
And you too.

318
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:25,094
Never forgive you.
You know his secret.

319
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,842
Kill you.

320
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,845
You've tried.

321
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:37,594
Now go.

322
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,215
Go to Paris, go to France.
Get away from it all possible.

323
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,804
Do you?

324
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:50,760
I'm safe.
She does not know that there Athos.

325
00:31:54,685 --> 00:32:00,053
If you stay, your life will be worthless.
Do you understand?

326
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:05,217
No. You forget
I have to find Constance.

327
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:08,892
That clumsy seamstress!

328
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:12,184
Watch out! I love her.

329
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:14,017
Or I think so.

330
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,012
I will ask the Queen
help us find her.

331
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:21,422
As regards
stigmatized the lady and her revenge:

332
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:26,846
Our regiment moves tomorrow
to La Rochelle. Far enough.

333
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:34,299
- Where are you going, musketeer?
- To see the Queen.

334
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:39,758
His Majesty receives none,
but will be happy to Cardinal.

335
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:49,799
D'Artagnan of Gascony.
They say you are a swordsman.

336
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:51,763
I halagáis.

337
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:55,141
- A conspirator.
- Everyone has something about it.

338
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,801
- An enemy.
- It is my honor to have you as an enemy.

339
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:00,595
Me?

340
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,219
I have no enemies.
Only in France.

341
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:12,179
But I seem to be surrounded by
enemies carrying your emblem.

342
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:17,633
You also bear my emblem.
You serve to France, just like me.

343
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:20,388
Accept a job on my watch.

344
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,633
Those enemies
are enemies of France.

345
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:25,760
Averiguad who they are.

346
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:29,805
Take my emblem.
Accept my appreciation.

347
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:37,220
Eminence, what I can say?

348
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:40,344
A "yes" would suffice.

349
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:44,095
I can not.

350
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,017
You're soaked.

351
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:51,975
Wet or not, I can.

352
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:57,642
- Give me your hand. Your fortune is assured.
- No, I can!

353
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:04,429
I will not withdraw my hand.
I am offering the.

354
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,725
It is your future.
Give me your hand!

355
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:11,429
No.

356
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:18,423
- Are you going to the siege of La Rochelle?
- Yes

357
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:20,930
It is a dangerous journey.

358
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:23,966
I wish you no harm,

359
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,302
- But I can not protect you.
- Not me I have asked you.

360
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:31,134
Do not move a finger to save you.

361
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,177
I am very sorry to
accept your offer.

362
00:35:36,726 --> 00:35:39,179
I do not make an offer
twice in one day.

363
00:35:39,643 --> 00:35:45,841
But if you return alive to Paris
could repeat it.

364
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:51,142
Because then
you would be an extraordinary young man.

365
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,137
Not fail to tell the tale.

366
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:57,599
Goodbye.

367
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,301
This young idiot
has rejected the offer of Richelieu.

368
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:15,138
That opens the season for you.

369
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,177
That boy cocky.

370
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:18,638
No!

371
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:26,094
We should make sure you have
a journey full of emotions.

372
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,178
That's an easy fix.

373
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:31,717
The Musketeers
and his regiment leave Paris tomorrow.

374
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:35,881
Serve as messengers
on their way to La Rochelle.

375
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:39,598
D'Artagnan and his friends travel
normally in small groups.

376
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,756
Should not be difficult
entertain during your trip.

377
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:48,172
Great. And the Bonacieux?

378
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:53,973
Enjoy the company of my
guards in the castle Saint-Cloud.

379
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:57,297
They strive to meet

380
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:01,809
their basic needs.
So it is in good hands.

381
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:03,346
Do not worry.

382
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:08,846
The Queen will need a new
seamstress as you say so.

383
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:32,261
What Saint-Cloud?

384
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,641
He will kill
my wife as desired.

385
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:38,092
And she will do anything
to get back at you.

386
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,474
The release you tonight.

387
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:46,426
- But where can go?
- In the convent of Armentières be secure.

388
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:49,974
But the men of Rochefort
await you.

389
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,966
Let us do so. This is what
least we can do for you.

390
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:57,219
She can stay with the sisters
while we are in La Rochelle.

391
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:00,054
I'm sure
they will have much to say.

392
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:04,428
I will remplazaré in gait and
we will meet within three days.

393
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:08,969
You try to comfort someone
until we return.

394
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:34,174
Aramis!

395
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:35,756
Forgive me!

396
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:39,221
The key!

397
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,889
Do not let the lame!

398
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:46,471
We need it!

399
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,517
Go to the window!

400
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:07,100
Hello, dear.
Would you get on my shoulders?

401
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,221
There he is!

402
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,767
Come, my dear. Here we are.

403
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:05,719
- Yes!
- Good morning, sister. Be good.

404
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:10,516
The siege of La Rochelle
has been very difficult.

405
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,890
Especially since no one obeys.

406
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:16,346
For example:

407
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,807
I would have raised
siege towers at dawn.

408
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,342
No, no. Before dawn.

409
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,724
- Good afternoon. Have you seen a musketeer?
- No, not yet.

410
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:29,348
On the table is a letter
for you. It arrived today.

411
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,092
Unfortunately, my superiors

412
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,806
not appreciate my strategy.
Love, your ...

413
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:41,385
What does it say?

414
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:50,132
The lyrics are almost
unreadable. Maybe you could ...

415
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:56,928
"Dear Monsieur D'Artagnan,
Knights Athos, Porthos and Aramis

416
00:40:57,393 --> 00:41:02,134
were in my inn. "
The letter is dated Villoix innkeeper.

417
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:08,799
"They were so drunk they will
to spend a few days in jail.

418
00:41:09,685 --> 00:41:13,892
They sent me to send you this wine
to provide for them. "

419
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:18,475
This I call true friendship.
Even drunk I think.

420
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:26,049
No. I pay the deposit
and we drink together.

421
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:46,346
But what have I done?

422
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:42,725
Who the hell
fight outside in this weather?

423
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,465
- Only a fool.
- Do you think that D'Artagnan has something to do with it?

424
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:48,724
Who else in this way?

425
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:34,220
That is why!

426
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:38,554
And this.

427
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:25,601
Do not worry. I'm coming. I help ...

428
00:45:32,685 --> 00:45:34,391
- Take me with you!
- Get out!

429
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:37,381
Help me!

430
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,637
Are you hurt?

431
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:01,680
- No, no.
- Well, come on.

432
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,965
He still lives here.
Then we took.

433
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:08,219
We chat
on plans for the lady.

434
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:14,761
What about me?

435
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:17,552
I'm freezing!

436
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,389
- What do you think?
- Nothing.

437
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,059
We had to go to the inn
"Palomar red" near La Rochelle.

438
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:33,722
Oh, God, my arm!

439
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:36,471
I swear not a name!

440
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:37,929
Planchet!

441
00:46:38,393 --> 00:46:41,474
- Brandy!
- Come on! Move!

442
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:45,016
Here is your wine.
This will help.

443
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:52,257
For the love of God,
Give me something to drink.

444
00:46:55,851 --> 00:47:02,049
Do I have to die I thirst and cold
while the baby robber?

445
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:05,341
- Have you gone crazy?
- There you go!

446
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,840
I never liked that crop.

447
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,300
- Where did this come out?
- You guys have sent!

448
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:23,339
Villeroy came from the inn.

449
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,263
- We have not sent any wine.
- But we know who has.

450
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:29,131
An ambush on the road.
Poisoned wine.

451
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:32,268
It appears that Milady is tenacious.

452
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:37,597
The sooner we get to the field
Battle of La Rochelle, the better.

453
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:41,681
Posada "red Palomar."

454
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:48,882
- To me they are disgusting.
- But please, try one.

455
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:05,970
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

456
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:11,506
Sight
these sinners who hang here.

457
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:14,471
Cardinal!

458
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,636
- La Rochelle has fallen, right?
- Not at all, Your Majesty.

459
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:36,807
The pigeon has arrived
the pigeon, Eminence.

460
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,267
Eminence!

461
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,682
Yes, it's here.

462
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:22,393
Or the luck is on your side,
or you cheat.

463
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:26,975
- It's a matter of faith.
- Your faith costs me money.

464
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:32,590
Every afternoon in this place, only
because this rogue has appointed him.

465
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,097
What are we waiting?

466
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:39,638
Richelieu!

467
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:44,174
What the hell is he doing here?

468
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:52,554
- So no one knows you're here?
- The host has been well paid.

469
00:49:53,018 --> 00:49:57,177
In any case, Milady.

470
00:49:57,643 --> 00:50:01,719
To charge shall do the following:
A ship waiting at the mouth.

471
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:04,092
Embarcad tonight. In London

472
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,885
shall pray to the Duke of Buckingham
that does not support the rebels.

473
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:11,555
No food,
no help, no English fleet.

474
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:14,471
If it still supports them,

475
00:50:14,935 --> 00:50:18,845
go to war with France,
a war that can not win.

476
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,013
Addition,

477
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,593
Queen of France,
at which the both appreciates,

478
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:31,720
will be put into evidence and dishonored,
I give you my word.

479
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:36,599
What if you listen to?

480
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,639
Then we must pray
that the Duke has an accident.

481
00:50:44,268 --> 00:50:45,263
I understand.

482
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:50,051
Of course, we advise
take the right decision.

483
00:50:50,518 --> 00:50:54,132
Bon voyage, Milady.

484
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,347
I do not want money as a reward.

485
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:00,257
No?

486
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:03,131
I have matters to settle.

487
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:05,971
Your issues do not interest me.

488
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:07,844
It is my desire.

489
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,679
Your desires do not interest me.

490
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,975
But of course you can
you set the same price.

491
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:19,721
A death.

492
00:51:20,185 --> 00:51:23,881
I will not help you
in your private murders.

493
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:27,090
I need help.

494
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,423
I just need
your signature on a pass

495
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:35,424
to eliminate the harlot
Bonacieux and her lover.

496
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:38,805
No.

497
00:51:39,768 --> 00:51:41,426
Eminence.

498
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:45,223
The death of Buckingham
for the death of D'Artagnan. Their lives

499
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,426
for the good of France.

500
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:13,187
- So?
- Seek D'Artagnan and stay with him.

501
00:52:13,188 --> 00:52:14,072
Do you?

502
00:52:14,518 --> 00:52:17,469
- I'll go when I can.
- Be careful.

503
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:34,017
What do you want? Who are you?
How dare you?

504
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:36,511
He was right.

505
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:39,759
You're still beautiful.

506
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,136
Count de la Fere!

507
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:50,888
Oh, no, milady.

508
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:54,223
The count of Fere has died.

509
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,307
Years ago I killed it.

510
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:58,600
Do you remember?

511
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:02,219
A hunt.

512
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:04,177
On a summer day.

513
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,304
I'm so stigmatized like you.

514
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,224
What do you want?
No longer binds us all.

515
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,135
Thank God.

516
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:24,300
But perhaps one thing we do.

517
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,261
I know you.

518
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:31,141
I know what has happened here.

519
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:36,224
Let me tell you something.

520
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:39,801
I do not care if you kill Buckingham.

521
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:42,305
Is an Englishman and an enemy.

522
00:53:42,768 --> 00:53:45,719
But if you touch him
a hair of D'Artagnan,

523
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:50,510
I swear I will kill you
with my own hands.

524
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,304
No.

525
00:53:56,185 --> 00:53:58,471
Monsieur D'Artagnan

526
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,257
attacked and insulted me ...

527
00:54:01,726 --> 00:54:05,174
Since when can you insult?

528
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,510
... and die for it.

529
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:19,092
Have you ever seen a woman
shot in the stomach?

530
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:25,553
I know, Milady.

531
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:28,304
Give me the letter from the Cardinal.

532
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:32,636
I give you five seconds.

533
00:54:36,435 --> 00:54:39,847
All right.

534
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:47,677
One, two,

535
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:50,180
three, four ...

536
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:09,382
"On my orders
and for the sake of our state

537
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:19,760
has done what he has done
the bearer of this letter. Richelieu. "

538
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:27,970
Very clever and witty,
Cardinal.

539
00:55:28,435 --> 00:55:32,428
It gives you what you want
without incriminating.

540
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:38,554
Unfortunately you have no time to
inform you before your departure.

541
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:50,346
Have a good trip.

542
00:56:26,726 --> 00:56:29,179
In the outer bastion
are not rebels.

543
00:56:29,643 --> 00:56:31,966
But we will not endure.

544
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,849
It's only seven.

545
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,682
At nine we will
a frontal attack. Or at ten.

546
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:44,558
- A musketeer! Where have you been?
- Good morning, gentlemen.

547
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:49,932
Shine! Come, quick!

548
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,639
- What is it, handsome?
- Let me! Obsessed!

549
00:56:57,476 --> 00:56:59,099
Thank you very much.

550
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:13,797
Where is the Gascon?
We need to talk to him.

551
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:16,554
There, in the trench.

552
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:21,426
A meeting? But where?
Here nothing is secret.

553
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:26,473
The Cardinal has eyes and ears
everywhere.

554
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:29,008
Right. Where can we go?

555
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:33,221
We had much to do.
And where were the musketeers?

556
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:36,173
We prayed for you.

557
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:38,598
I also have.

558
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,223
In the bastion
was like being in a hive.

559
00:57:42,685 --> 00:57:44,510
However,
you have not been to breakfast.

560
00:57:46,643 --> 00:57:47,804
You would have done neither.

561
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:54,631
What bet?

562
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:58,682
I bet more ...

563
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:05,178
I bet the best of dinners
to breakfast in the bastion.

564
00:58:05,643 --> 00:58:07,052
And now.

565
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,638
I agree.

566
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:17,470
- Have you heard, Spengler. We're going to eat the two of us.
- What happens?

567
00:58:17,935 --> 00:58:22,675
Athos has been proposed that kill us
up there for breakfast.

568
00:58:23,143 --> 00:58:28,298
Planchet! Bring bread, four chickens,
ham, oysters and wine. Right now!

569
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,218
Instead of wine, take champagne.

570
00:58:30,518 --> 00:58:34,132
What for breakfast? My dear Porthos!

571
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:37,848
- Planchet! Money, money, money ...
- You you can afford!

572
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:44,097
- Thistles!
- A little far for breakfast!

573
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,597
Is not that right, Athos?

574
00:58:49,435 --> 00:58:54,139
There! Is it that you are blind?
Someone approaches the stronghold! Fire!

575
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:02,225
Hurry! I cover you! Quick!

576
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:09,010
There!

577
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:11,099
Be careful, Planchet!

578
00:59:12,185 --> 00:59:13,761
All right?

579
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:19,427
Why the attacks
are always uphill?

580
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:22,179
I'm getting old.

581
00:59:28,435 --> 00:59:32,642
- I have to tell you something important!
- You have to speak up!

582
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:37,758
You three id up there!
And all three of you so prepare yourselves!

583
00:59:47,643 --> 00:59:50,427
Finally we can talk in peace.

584
00:59:58,185 --> 01:00:01,799
Here tennis your wine, sir.
It's an ideal temperature.

585
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,887
Come Planchet, open it now!

586
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,055
Cursed Pirate innkeeper!
This is not champagne!

587
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,639
The wine will not bear transportation.

588
01:00:18,101 --> 01:00:22,308
Have you seen the cardinal?
And you want to kill Buckingham?

589
01:00:22,768 --> 01:00:28,183
If necessary. And from what I know
Buckingham, will be necessary. Bring!

590
01:00:32,435 --> 01:00:36,049
One moment, gentlemen!
We are eating breakfast!

591
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:42,133
They have no manners, these infidels.

592
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,765
- We can not allow!
- Why? He is on his side.

593
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,553
Exactly! And is English!

594
01:00:48,018 --> 01:00:51,430
No! It is a brave and honorable
who love our Queen.

595
01:00:51,893 --> 01:00:55,638
I will not let die
into the possession of ...

596
01:00:56,101 --> 01:01:00,225
She also has condemned you to death,
to you and Madame Bonacieux.

597
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:04,630
Here, read it while you eat breakfast
and then hide it well in the boot.

598
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:09,094
Fire!

599
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,721
Failed.

600
01:01:13,185 --> 01:01:19,347
It would be better to strangle Milady
to shoot these devils Protestants.

601
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:26,638
Why kill them, why sing
French and us in Latin?

602
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:31,675
Porthos, is that you know nothing?
What do you think is a religious war?

603
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:43,174
Here they come!
Come on, every shot a hit!

604
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:48,799
Hurry, Planchet!
Re-load!

605
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:11,470
Come Planchet.
Use both hands!

606
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,554
A loaf of bread!

607
01:03:35,893 --> 01:03:36,888
Mine!

608
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:50,091
What a waste!

609
01:03:51,185 --> 01:03:52,761
Forgiveness.

610
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,763
Quick, come! The Wall!

611
01:04:09,226 --> 01:04:13,765
Pushing force! Pushing force for your lives!

612
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,932
Sorry, gentlemen.

613
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,632
Push, Porthos! Be strong!

614
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:44,808
- Athos! I have to tell the Queen of Buckingham!
- Later!

615
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:47,424
I suggest we go!

616
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:49,137
Take!

617
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:51,094
Thank you very much.

618
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:59,183
Could you give me a hand?

619
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:04,306
Can you help?

620
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:05,846
Shopping.

621
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:08,760
Can you?

622
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:11,888
Seguidles!

623
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:42,850
Come back soon. Safely.

624
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:46,924
Back and pagans,
or we will find you.

625
01:05:47,393 --> 01:05:50,095
We will never see them.

626
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:56,219
- Here we are.
- Well done, D'Artagnan. And Athos, come.

627
01:05:56,685 --> 01:05:59,552
It goes against our
principles, but toast!

628
01:06:00,018 --> 01:06:02,388
And Aramis! You too. Well done.

629
01:06:02,851 --> 01:06:06,098
Here's money.
Be filled with the stomach.

630
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:13,972
Your journey has been in vain.

631
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:20,307
Tell him or her threats
or convince me your beauty.

632
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:23,931
I help the Protestants
La Rochelle.

633
01:06:24,393 --> 01:06:25,933
Tell him to the Cardinal.

634
01:06:26,393 --> 01:06:30,517
I do not think that you may live to
repent, Lord Buckingham.

635
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:09,970
He was sure that Cardinal
exhaust every diplomatic option.

636
01:07:10,435 --> 01:07:14,973
Now I am completely determined
to help the rebels.

637
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:16,844
He communicated to His Eminence.

638
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,016
Do not you notify anyone.

639
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:25,425
You came as an ambassador,
but you remain as murderous.

640
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:28,014
- No you will boldly.
- Oh, no?

641
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:32,600
A week in a room
overlooking the sea in the tower.

642
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:37,219
When navigating with my fleet to
France, you also navegaréis.

643
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:40,469
To the colonies of the King in America.

644
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:42,392
America!

645
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:46,513
They say they are
full of wild-looking.

646
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:49,891
Once there, perhaps you succeed

647
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:54,013
Use your beauty
for someone to bring you home.

648
01:07:54,476 --> 01:07:56,099
But until then,
no illusions for yourselves.

649
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,636
Your jailer not see the beauty
however extraordinary it is.

650
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:04,846
You can not soften. Felton!

651
01:08:06,976 --> 01:08:08,138
¿Milord?

652
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:11,848
Milady leads to the tower.
It is under your supervision.

653
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:15,432
No one else can see it.

654
01:08:58,685 --> 01:09:00,094
¿Good man?

655
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:05,761
Could you comfort me in this place
with the word of God?

656
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,893
A Bible. And the Psalms.

657
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,136
Are not you Catholic?

658
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,267
No.

659
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:19,100
No, sir.

660
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,968
I Huguenot.
They condemn us for our faith.

661
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:37,176
This is mine.

662
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:42,631
Tomorrow will bring the Psalms.

663
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:45,092
God bless you!

664
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:17,593
Does the Cardinal
that woman has sent to England

665
01:10:18,018 --> 01:10:19,262
to kill?

666
01:10:22,726 --> 01:10:23,721
Oh, no.

667
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:26,975
We must warn you!

668
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:30,349
- Go and tell, D'Artagnan!
- I can not go!

669
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,677
The spies of the Cardinal
are everywhere.

670
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:39,132
But our messenger could
take a letter to Lord Buckingham.

671
01:10:50,643 --> 01:10:54,683
- I am indebted to you.
- No, Your Majesty.

672
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:57,347
Majesty the King is waiting!

673
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,342
I have good news.

674
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,717
Constance is safe.

675
01:11:04,185 --> 01:11:07,136
It is in the convent of Santa Cecilia,
near Armentieres.

676
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:10,682
Then end the siege,
the take back to Paris.

677
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:13,180
Lady, the King!

678
01:11:20,351 --> 01:11:21,892
Salvadle for me.

679
01:11:24,768 --> 01:11:27,636
God bless you.
And tell the messenger

680
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:29,724
to hurry.

681
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:57,014
This is the best
I could get for the money.

682
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:09,466
Do not let your foot be moved;
or numb the ...

683
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:14,631
Lord is your protector;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right ...

684
01:12:15,101 --> 01:12:18,763
The sun shall not smite you by day,
nor the moon by night.

685
01:12:19,226 --> 01:12:23,718
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.

686
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:26,933
Jehovah
preserve thy going out and thy coming ...

687
01:12:27,393 --> 01:12:30,474
... now and forever.

688
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:32,925
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

689
01:12:33,393 --> 01:12:36,060
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

690
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,639
Do not allow your foot
nor slumber that keepeth thee ...

691
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:42,348
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

692
01:12:43,851 --> 01:12:48,011
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

693
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:17,046
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

694
01:13:17,515 --> 01:13:21,555
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

695
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:27,087
... nor he that keepeth thee slumber.
Behold, he is numb ...

696
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:29,097
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.

697
01:13:37,556 --> 01:13:42,130
When they cry,
the Lord

698
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:46,763
listens
and delivers them from all their troubles.

699
01:13:48,015 --> 01:13:50,550
The Lord is near ...

700
01:13:52,931 --> 01:13:54,507
Amen.

701
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:24,839
Master Felton.

702
01:14:25,306 --> 01:14:28,553
For two nights I do not sleep.

703
01:14:29,015 --> 01:14:32,795
Wake up I'm closer to God.

704
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:37,507
God will sail while you sleep, Milady.

705
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:08,341
Help me!

706
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:13,421
God, help me! Help to mine
not to be condemned!

707
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:16,129
Deliver them of the traitor, the antichrist,

708
01:15:16,598 --> 01:15:18,340
so as not to corrupt and destroy

709
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:22,137
as it has corrupted and destroyed
to me. Send me an angel

710
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:26,674
to destroy your enemies!
Help me! Help me!

711
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:28,972
Who is the antichrist, traitor?

712
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:32,216
Your master, the Duke of Buckingham.

713
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:35,763
He is the Philistine cursed Israel.

714
01:15:37,098 --> 01:15:41,008
Thou art Puritan
and still serve him.

715
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:47,387
- In La Rochelle die for their faith and betrays them.
- No!

716
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:53,880
- No! He will save them.
- He deceives the world and will betray.

717
01:15:54,348 --> 01:15:59,503
He goes to Paris to meet
Catholic Queen with her lascivious.

718
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,170
Help me, master Felton.
Vos tennis eyes of a saint.

719
01:16:06,056 --> 01:16:08,924
Help me to warn our people.

720
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:13,504
I can not think.

721
01:16:13,973 --> 01:16:15,252
Help me.

722
01:17:12,848 --> 01:17:14,257
Felton,

723
01:17:14,723 --> 01:17:17,425
can not stop this betrayal
unpunished.

724
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:21,800
- Your destiny is in God's hands. His will be done.
- Yes

725
01:17:22,265 --> 01:17:23,378
So be it.

726
01:17:30,223 --> 01:17:33,423
Then the dragon
was enraged against women;

727
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:37,718
and went to make war
the rest of her offspring.

728
01:17:43,515 --> 01:17:47,639
Say ten pence.
Is steel good, hard as ivory.

729
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:52,471
Your change, sir. Its back!

730
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:31,889
Lord Buckingham!

731
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:03,006
Seems that Lord Buckingham
not going to leave England.

732
01:19:03,473 --> 01:19:05,878
Congratulations.

733
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:28,587
Reek of England and to Calvinism.

734
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,679
The issues
Cardinal is fixed.

735
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:36,377
Now I take care of mine.
I'm going to St. Cloud to see Bonacieux.

736
01:19:38,515 --> 01:19:41,927
No. It is in the convent
Santa Cecilia in Armentieres.

737
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:45,139
One of my men has followed
but it has spoiled.

738
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:15,427
Sorry.

739
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:20,215
- And D'Artagnan?
- La Rochelle surrendered three days ago.

740
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:35,889
So La Rochelle has fallen.

741
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:38,138
And not in time.

742
01:20:38,598 --> 01:20:42,295
- What you going to spend, Porthos?
- After paying the drink

743
01:20:42,765 --> 01:20:45,798
Athos and Aramis pardons,
will not be too much.

744
01:20:46,265 --> 01:20:48,386
Do not forget the needy.

745
01:20:49,556 --> 01:20:51,761
Come on. Constance is in danger!

746
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:57,299
Are on their way to Armentières
to pick up her lover.

747
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:01,177
Do not worry,
can not be beyond Paris.

748
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,554
We may be
in Armentières at dawn.

749
01:21:05,015 --> 01:21:06,887
Twelve of our men are already there

750
01:21:07,348 --> 01:21:11,721
to give
Welcome to D'Artagnan.

751
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:18,676
And ye have to all, Milady.

752
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:47,840
Welcome,
welcome, Musketeers!

753
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:51,467
The poor animals
are exhausted, Athos.

754
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:53,756
Not only the poor animals.

755
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:56,794
- How much is left to the monastery of Santa Cecilia?
- Two miles!

756
01:21:57,265 --> 01:21:59,718
Following the road to Brussels.

757
01:22:02,473 --> 01:22:05,471
We're almost there, boy.

758
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:07,969
Time for a glass of wine!

759
01:22:09,056 --> 01:22:13,963
Then we accompany you to
your loved one. Wine! Come, come!

760
01:22:19,223 --> 01:22:22,387
So reassure us.

761
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:35,305
Hey, stop!

762
01:22:35,765 --> 01:22:37,802
Faster!

763
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:45,343
Athos!

764
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:50,799
Athos! It's here!

765
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:55,591
Rochefort! I have seen! Come on!

766
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:58,094
Let us follow him!

767
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:02,841
Come on! Hurry!

768
01:23:03,306 --> 01:23:05,344
Sigámosles!

769
01:23:09,348 --> 01:23:14,882
Sigámosles! Quick!

770
01:23:20,556 --> 01:23:22,512
The horse has no seat, sir!

771
01:23:51,931 --> 01:23:54,005
There they are!

772
01:24:12,556 --> 01:24:14,298
Easy!

773
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:18,342
There is another entrance.

774
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:33,722
Bring them in! Go to the barn!
We are! Stop!

775
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:45,091
Look for the girl!
I take care of the riders!

776
01:24:45,556 --> 01:24:47,512
Here they come! Here they come!

777
01:24:47,973 --> 01:24:50,011
Fire!

778
01:24:56,473 --> 01:24:58,511
They come from behind!

779
01:25:08,306 --> 01:25:10,463
Do not let them escape! Fire!

780
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:49,508
Aramis!

781
01:26:04,348 --> 01:26:05,426
Fire!

782
01:27:21,973 --> 01:27:23,252
Thank you!

783
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,967
Come on, Rochefort!

784
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:08,675
Come!

785
01:29:12,223 --> 01:29:14,546
- Aramis!
- Porthos!

786
01:29:19,223 --> 01:29:20,632
Aramis!

787
01:29:22,015 --> 01:29:23,045
Quick!

788
01:30:10,265 --> 01:30:14,887
... Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil ...

789
01:30:18,431 --> 01:30:19,758
What happened?

790
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:23,553
My dear girl.
Do not be afraid. Keep praying.

791
01:30:24,015 --> 01:30:26,764
- The shooting ...
- ... soon be over.

792
01:30:27,223 --> 01:30:29,842
I'm a friend.
Soon you will be free.

793
01:30:30,306 --> 01:30:32,712
- Monsieur D'Artagnan ...
- Are here!

794
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:35,551
Next comes.

795
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:40,008
End of praying.
Pray also for him.

796
01:30:40,473 --> 01:30:44,052
- And his brave men.
- Yes

797
01:30:44,515 --> 01:30:50,014
- You really are here, sister?
- And will not leave without you.

798
01:30:50,473 --> 01:30:52,298
So ...

799
01:30:53,806 --> 01:30:55,347
I expect you.

800
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,972
"Only Porthos invent new ways
to disarm itself. "

801
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,177
Out of here!

802
01:31:47,473 --> 01:31:50,424
Do not cry, little girl.

803
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:53,639
You have to be pretty
for D'Artagnan.

804
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:55,676
Yes.

805
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:28,679
- Why is it always my turn?
- You're getting old.

806
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:35,340
Where is Rochefort?

807
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:38,176
We have not seen.

808
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:42,343
Constance!

809
01:32:45,098 --> 01:32:46,176
Constance!

810
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:27,639
Where will you go will not need
no horse.

811
01:33:28,098 --> 01:33:30,503
I warned you.

812
01:34:01,848 --> 01:34:05,095
I advise you to run
to save your life.

813
01:34:07,473 --> 01:34:09,380
Murderer!

814
01:34:26,598 --> 01:34:28,139
Damn!

815
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:31,295
Stop! Stop fighting!

816
01:37:39,598 --> 01:37:44,504
We are here as judges.

817
01:37:45,598 --> 01:37:48,003
What is your verdict?

818
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:50,134
Death penalty.

819
01:37:54,598 --> 01:37:56,470
Death penalty

820
01:38:02,848 --> 01:38:03,843
Death penalty.

821
01:38:04,931 --> 01:38:05,926
Death penalty.

822
01:38:17,723 --> 01:38:20,009
Vos the estigmatizasteis then.

823
01:38:22,431 --> 01:38:26,674
As earl Fère and
authority granted to me,

824
01:38:29,056 --> 01:38:32,552
- Condemn this woman to death.
- I want five doubloons.

825
01:38:55,098 --> 01:38:56,093
D'Artagnan!

826
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:06,884
No!

827
01:39:07,348 --> 01:39:11,638
No! You are not my judges.
Take me to a judge!

828
01:39:12,098 --> 01:39:13,507
No!

829
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:22,091
One more step, D'Artagnan,
and our swords will cross.

830
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:25,341
I swear to God
this time going to die!

831
01:40:40,723 --> 01:40:45,096
Two more doubloons row.
I'm executioner, not a sailor.

832
01:41:05,765 --> 01:41:09,628
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Your Sword! Yours too!

833
01:41:10,098 --> 01:41:13,049
On behalf of Cardinal!

834
01:41:16,098 --> 01:41:19,713
On one occasion
I held out my hand.

835
01:41:20,181 --> 01:41:21,804
This time I will not.

836
01:41:22,265 --> 01:41:25,844
This time you are accused of murder
a servant of the state.

837
01:41:26,306 --> 01:41:28,214
I fought with their own weapons.

838
01:41:28,681 --> 01:41:31,928
And you won.
Also against Rochefort. Not bad.

839
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:35,720
But your victories are expensive.
For me and for France.

840
01:41:36,181 --> 01:41:38,800
I extend the hand of France
to get paid.

841
01:41:40,306 --> 01:41:44,252
I will not pay a penny, or
shed a tear, not to repent.

842
01:41:45,348 --> 01:41:48,630
Then you judge and condemn.

843
01:41:49,098 --> 01:41:50,888
I think not.

844
01:41:51,348 --> 01:41:53,422
I have a pass to all.

845
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:57,835
¿Signed by whom? The Queen can not,
King would not.

846
01:41:58,306 --> 01:42:00,463
For you, Your Eminence.

847
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,337
Why me?

848
01:42:10,306 --> 01:42:12,344
"On my orders
and for the sake of our state,

849
01:42:12,806 --> 01:42:16,137
has done what he has done
the bearer of this letter. "

850
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:23,506
One must be careful
what you write.

851
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,588
And who delivers it.

852
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:35,094
I have to remember.

853
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:39,597
This makes you real musketeer.
Name is missing,

854
01:42:40,056 --> 01:42:45,342
but I give it to you.
Your friends are also free.

855
01:42:45,806 --> 01:42:48,010
Good morning, Monsieur D'Artagnan.

856
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:05,096
Athos,

857
01:43:05,556 --> 01:43:08,341
Cardinal has given me this.

858
01:43:08,806 --> 01:43:12,800
I can not accept.
Should be for you.

859
01:43:15,973 --> 01:43:18,129
To the Count de la Fere is little,

860
01:43:18,598 --> 01:43:21,964
for Athos too.
You deserve it, boy.

861
01:43:22,431 --> 01:43:24,339
Aramis, dear friend.

862
01:43:24,806 --> 01:43:27,046
You have education and studies.

863
01:43:27,515 --> 01:43:30,133
You should have it.

864
01:43:30,598 --> 01:43:33,513
You forget that I
I am only a Musketeer provisionally.

865
01:43:33,973 --> 01:43:36,462
Whenever I get time
ordain me priest.

866
01:43:36,931 --> 01:43:40,297
- Look at me, please! How do I have?
- Well,

867
01:43:40,765 --> 01:43:43,514
- But that you would be much better.
- Lieutenant!

868
01:43:43,973 --> 01:43:48,263
I'm flattered, but I will not.
One has to wonder

869
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:52,764
if such a position is for a gentleman.

870
01:43:53,223 --> 01:43:54,550
Would lose my friends!

871
01:43:55,015 --> 01:43:58,048
A lieutenant can not go
with private Musketeers.

872
01:43:58,515 --> 01:44:01,678
Even with those who
helped when I was young and foolish.

873
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,628
When run over to all
to fight a duel,

874
01:44:05,098 --> 01:44:06,591
was ridiculous,

875
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,254
struggled with the guards
Cardinal as his friends,

876
01:44:11,723 --> 01:44:15,764
older and wiser, trying
stop him and him away from trouble.

877
01:44:16,223 --> 01:44:21,046
Oh, how we help
to take his first steps!

878
01:44:21,515 --> 01:44:25,046
We teach the rules
high society.

879
01:44:25,515 --> 01:44:28,264
We aleccionamos in all the arts
a young gentleman should know.

880
01:44:28,723 --> 01:44:35,300
We protected him against enemies
and temptations of this wicked world.

881
01:44:35,765 --> 01:44:38,881
What would become of him without us?

882
01:44:39,348 --> 01:44:40,592
Or we be without him?

883
01:44:41,056 --> 01:44:44,884
So it really was:

884
01:44:45,348 --> 01:44:49,258
"One for all and all for one".
