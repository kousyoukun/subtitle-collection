Small breasts, brunette.

Yes, I do.
Without a condom.

58
00:09:06,760 -> 00:09:09,840
Such are the stakes.

59
00:09:14,320 -> 00:09:17,200
The evening.

60
00:09:17,200 -> 00:09:20,080

61

- Are not you afraid?
- Location!

66
00:09:41,200 -> 00:09:45,320
These guys just sleep with their wives.

67
00:09:45,720 -> 00:09:49,440
The risk is slightly larger with Thomas.

68
00:09:49,440 -> 00:09:51,800
Oh, yes.

69
00:09:51,880 -> 00:09:55,880

71
00:10:02,080 -> 00:10:05,880
I'm very organized.

72
00:10:07,240 -> 00:10:09,920
I started when I came to the conclusion
of not getting into graduate school,

73

75
00:10:17,960 -> 00:10:22,640
It's the worst job.
You to finish.

76
00:10:22,720 -> 00:10:27,680
Sometimes I walk there yet,
for smoke.

It is hard to throw.

81
00:10:41,040 -> 00:10:45,120

I imagine that this is not easy.

84
00:11:03,320 -> 00:11:06,960
This job does not take much time,

85
00:11:07,040 -> 00:11:11,440
for money and easy to get.

86

You do it because you want to fuck me?

- Do you have Arab friends?
- Do not.

179
00:21:27,160 -> 00:21:31,800
As it happened.
It's not a question of prejudice.

180
00:21:39,400 -> 00:21:42,800
French hypocrisy.

181
00:21:50,400 -> 00:21:52,960
Nice shoes.

182
00:21:52,960 -> 00:21:55,120
Expensive?

183
00:21:55,160 -> 00:21:58,080
Very expensive.

184
00:21:58,160 -> 00:22:01,480
Who are your customers?

185
00:22:03,960 -> 00:22:06,400
Bored husbands.

186
00:22:06,440 -> 00:22:09,280
Happy?

187
00:22:14,080 -> 00:22:19,280
I spend the first customer

188
00:22:20,680 -> 00:22:24,200

214
00:26:08,240 -> 00:26:13,120
After a month in Paris
I had a super flat.

215
00:26:14,680 -> 00:26:18,880
I often ask you about such things?

216
00:26:19,080 -> 00:26:22,080
This is your surprise?

217

With his wife that after all this is not mgl.

218

You do not like?

222
00:26:53,640 -> 00:26:57,040
We do not talk about me.

223
00:27:58,800 -> 00:28:01,800
Why are you calling?

224
00:28:02,200 -> 00:28:05,920
There we talked of the world.

225
00:28:09,800 -> 00:28:11,560
Yeah?

226
00:28:11,640 -> 00:28:14,120

227
00:28:14,280 -> 00:28:17,160
To the hospital?

228
00:28:18,240 -> 00:28:21,160
Today I can not.

229

Two bagels?
After all have diabetes.

230
00:28:40,640 -> 00:28:43,480

231
00:28:56,680 -> 00:28:59,360
Faster.

232
00:29:03,280 -> 00:29:05,960
Stop it.

233
00:29:14,640 -> 00:29:17,360

00:29:37,960 -> 00:29:41,400
I understand.
It must have been awful.

236
00:29:41,480 -> 00:29:44,960
You have other terrible experience?

237
00:29:45,040 -> 00:29:47,920

00:29:52,880 -> 00:29:55,400
Well, I do not understand.
Lost its way.

240
00:29:55,480 -> 00:30:00,320
You know what's going on?
About smrd staircase.

241
00:30:00,320 -> 00:30:03,880
Shoes artificial sparks.

242
00:30:04,800 -> 00:30:08,000
Furniture from a disc impeller.

243
00:30:08,520 -> 00:30:14,000
We can read Flaubert and Proust to study.
It will not change.

244
00:30:14,000 -> 00:30:19,080
Immediately be known,
I'm not like you.

245
00:30:21,960 -> 00:30:27,840
- I have no pretensions to the lady.
- I do not answer it in this manner whatsoever.

246
00:30:31,400 -> 00:30:35,720

You said zapamietalas
mole on the belly of this man.

248
00:30:53,520 -> 00:30:57,080
Whenever I think about it,

249
00:30:58,440 -> 00:31:01,720
I see this beauty spot.

250
00:31:01,800 -> 00:31:05,360
It was so human ...

251
00:31:07,560 -> 00:31:10,120
It must have been hard to take this step.

252
00:31:10,120 -> 00:31:14,920
I was anxious,
But it was not difficult.

253
00:31:16,000 -> 00:31:18,400
Posted the ad.

254
00:31:18,480 -> 00:31:22,840
Before I looked,
future reference 60 emails.

255
00:31:26,080 -> 00:31:29,720

256
00:31:30,320 -> 00:31:32,440
You wanted to share it?

257
00:31:32,480 -> 00:31:36,040
Told no one.

258
00:31:37,840 -> 00:31:41,640
Perhaps you felt alone.

259
00:31:47,000 -> 00:31:50,320
Not more than ...

260
00:31:53,320 -> 00:31:56,920
Man is always the same.

261
00:32:21,440 -> 00:32:24,080

Soon, I'm done.

266

No, listen, I have two girls.

269
00:33:16,040 -> 00:33:18,480
It's great stuff.

270
00:33:18,520 -> 00:33:21,920
Before this skrce to 8 thousand ...

271
00:33:21,960 -> 00:33:26,440
Were to be four pages
and title on the cover.

272
00:33:26,480 -> 00:33:29,320
Tomorrow morning, we agreed.

273
00:33:29,360 -> 00:33:31,400
I know when I go to print.

274
00:33:31,440 -> 00:33:32,320

278
00:33:42,360 -> 00:33:46,760
/ Does the same thing,
/ What about my boyfriend.

279

280
00:33:51,960 -> 00:33:55,680
/ You decide everything?

281
00:33:56,600 -> 00:33:59,240
/ There are things ktrych not want to do.

282
00:33:59,240 -> 00:34:02,520
/ For example, anal sex.

283
00:34:02,520 -> 00:34:05,840
/ Do not do it with your customers.

284
00:34:07,360 -> 00:34:12,560
Placa of hours.
Shortly after arriving I take a shower.

285
00:34:13,080 -> 00:34:15,600
A counter flies.

286
00:34:15,680 -> 00:34:18,040
For this they are clean.

287
00:34:18,040 -> 00:34:21,200
They like swintuszyc.

288
00:34:25,040 -> 00:34:28,160
"I put to you my great club."

289
00:34:28,200 -> 00:34:31,440
"Oh yes, the little bitch."

290
00:34:31,880 -> 00:34:33,960
Are you funny?

291
00:34:33,960 -> 00:34:36,320
Yes.

292
00:34:38,160 -> 00:34:42,440
- Are you doing away from the damp.
- I?

293
00:34:42,880 -> 00:34:43,960

- It's the talk winds.
- Ah, yes.

295
00:34:57,360 -> 00:34:59,880
Where is room 216?

296
00:34:59,960 -> 00:35:02,480
Straight.

297
00:35:27,600 -> 00:35:31,240
What do you want me to do?

298
00:35:33,240 -> 00:35:35,960
What do you want.

299
00:36:04,880 -> 00:36:07,920
Do not be afraid.

300
00:37:38,400 -> 00:37:41,600
Nothing happened.

301
00:37:51,640 -> 00:37:54,200
Please.

302
00:38:21,200 -> 00:38:24,120
- No and yes.

303
00:38:24,240 -> 00:38:26,560
Yes.

304
00:38:27,240 -> 00:38:30,560
Quiet here, peaceful.

305
00:38:30,560 -> 00:38:33,680
Yeah, okay.

306
00:38:36,320 -> 00:38:39,600
Old age is strange.

307
00:38:40,160 -> 00:38:43,840
I know this going.

308
00:38:46,360 -> 00:38:49,520
But ... alone.

309
00:38:55,120 -> 00:38:58,800
- You can do something for me?
- What? - Rub my feet.

310
00:38:58,840 -> 00:39:03,600
Massage stp?
I was just going to offer you.

311
00:40:42,360 -> 00:40:46,480
Like when you touch your breasts?

312
00:40:58,720 -> 00:41:02,160
Do you prefer to do fellatio?

313
00:41:07,920 -> 00:41:12,720
You have the feeling that dominates,
Are you dominated?

314
00:41:12,800 -> 00:41:16,400
Do you prefer when you are dominating?

315
00:41:26,560 -> 00:41:30,120
You do not want to answer.

316
00:41:33,000 -> 00:41:36,400
You have a sense of power?

317
00:41:48,240 -> 00:41:51,480
Not understand.

318
00:42:00,120 -> 00:42:04,680
Often after
return to their Domwe.

319
00:42:06,720 -> 00:42:11,760
Mwia awful lot.
I did not expect.

320
00:42:14,240 -> 00:42:18,240
For the first time I was afraid

321
00:42:18,360 -> 00:42:22,480
will be moved with me for hours.

322
00:42:23,760 -> 00:42:26,320
But no.

323
00:42:26,600 -> 00:42:30,160
Tell me about your life.

324
00:42:30,160 -> 00:42:32,640
About the job.

325
00:42:32,680 -> 00:42:35,200
Of wives.

326
00:42:35,200 -> 00:42:38,560
I do not like it.

327
00:42:39,920 -> 00:42:43,080
But glwnie of work.
Strange, is not it?

328
00:42:43,080 -> 00:42:46,640
They love to talk about it.

329
00:42:48,280 -> 00:42:51,600
I am studying, so ...

330
00:42:55,320 -> 00:42:58,160
Who are they?

331
00:43:00,600 -> 00:43:04,880
Represent a specific kind of people?
Have some problems?

332
00:43:04,920 -> 00:43:07,440
Not at all.

333
00:43:07,520 -> 00:43:10,920
They are perfectly normal.

334
00:43:11,040 -> 00:43:14,320
It is not like the thought.

335
00:43:14,360 -> 00:43:17,360
It's not there are any unhappy people.

336
00:43:17,400 -> 00:43:20,960
So it is usually the relationship?

337
00:43:23,440 -> 00:43:26,400
Not really.

338
00:43:27,520 -> 00:43:32,160
Are mostly in the age
my father, so ...

339
00:49:59,960 -> 00:50:02,240
Did not you hear what I said?

340
00:50:11,320 -> 00:50:14,200
You must be well organized.

341
00:50:14,200 -> 00:50:16,160
Of course.

342
00:50:16,240 -> 00:50:20,400
I can not enter the CV. It is a pity.

343
00:50:24,320 -> 00:50:27,920
How are you doing in college?

344
00:50:29,400 -> 00:50:32,320
Very good.

345
00:50:32,680 -> 00:50:36,680
At this time, worked Mankiw.

346

347
00:50:47,240 -> 00:50:50,360

00:50:50,400 -> 00:50:53,280
Well, Mom.

349
00:50:53,680 -> 00:50:56,480
I have to bite.

350
00:51:02,440 -> 00:51:04,280
Mankiw is a famous economist.

351
00:51:04,360 -> 00:51:07,040
Do not you know it?

352
00:51:07,120 -> 00:51:09,480
No.

353
00:51:23,160 -> 00:51:26,480
Do you think that you tell
about your children?

354
00:51:26,480 -> 00:51:28,920
I used to.

355
00:51:28,960 -> 00:51:31,400

Watch out.

362
00:53:21,120 -> 00:53:23,360
- Not now.
- Why?

363
00:53:23,440 -> 00:53:25,960
Because, yes.

364
00:53:28,960 -> 00:53:31,280
What?

365
00:54:02,280 -> 00:54:05,480
Have someone else?

366
00:54:05,960 -> 00:54:08,880
You're stupid.

367
00:54:24,200 -> 00:54:27,120
Patrick, call me.

368
00:54:27,120 -> 00:54:31,640
Florent was not in school from dwch days.

369
00:54:47,560 -> 00:54:51,120
Patrick, again, I do.
Why do you not speak?

370
00:54:51,160 -> 00:54:53,760
Call me.

371
00:55:44,080 -> 00:55:45,480
Yeah?

372
00:55:45,560 -> 00:55:47,640
Oh, it's you.

373
00:55:47,680 -> 00:55:53,080
No, I thought it was Florent.
I do not know what he was doing.

374
00:55:53,120 -> 00:55:56,400
Mwiles that I have to call you.

375
00:56:00,120 -> 00:56:03,560
Well, of course, from playing truant.

00:56:03,680 -> 00:56:06,320
Wait a minute.

Sorry.

378
00:56:19,640 -> 00:56:22,040
No.

379
00:56:26,880 -> 00:56:30,800
I'll call when you know something.

380
00:56:30,840 -> 00:56:31,920
Right.

381
00:56:31,960 -> 00:56:35,320

For the time being.

384
00:56:53,920 -> 00:56:57,720
I gotta go.
Must be clean.

385
00:56:58,120 -> 00:57:01,840
One can see from me, where was I?

386
00:57:01,880 -> 00:57:02,800
Right.

387
00:57:02,800 -> 00:57:05,000

388
00:57:05,040 -> 00:57:07,280
- All right?
- Yes.

389
00:57:07,320 -> 00:57:09,960
This is important.

390
00:57:36,560 -> 00:57:38,880
What are you doing?

391
00:57:38,920 -> 00:57:41,880
Taking the picture.

392
00:57:41,920 -> 00:57:43,920
Do not move.

393
00:57:43,960 -> 00:57:46,400
- Stop it.
- No BJ, no one knows you.

394
00:57:46,440 -> 00:57:48,200
Stop it.

395
00:57:48,200 -> 00:57:51,120
Lola, relax.

396
00:57:52,480 -> 00:57:54,800
Lola!

397
00:57:54,880 -> 00:57:57,400
Do not be silly.

398
00:57:57,440 -> 00:58:02,560
/ Delete the pictures, but give me the phone.
/ I have it all.

399
00:58:02,600 -> 00:58:05,080
/ Lola!

400
00:58:06,480 -> 00:58:08,760
/ I'm asking you.

401
00:58:15,520 -> 00:58:19,200
Give me a fucking phone.

402
01:01:48,240 -> 01:01:51,280
It is you, Florent?

403
01:02:11,160 -> 01:02:13,480
Can you tell me what is allowed to stand?

404
01:02:13,520 -> 01:02:16,240
- What is it in your hand?
- Nothing.

405
01:02:16,320 -> 01:02:19,880
What do you do all day?

406
01:02:22,120 -> 01:02:26,200
- Draw.
- Continue to repeat the class?

407
01:02:26,680 -> 01:02:29,640
No, but I have it in the ass.

408
01:02:29,640 -> 01:02:32,960
But I do not
and TWJ father or not.

409
01:02:33,040 -> 01:02:35,680
The best straight to the call.

410
01:02:35,680 -> 01:02:38,680
What can I do?

411
01:02:38,840 -> 01:02:43,640
Start with the solution
Problems own.

412
01:02:46,680 -> 01:02:48,480
I exaggerate a little.

413
01:02:48,560 -> 01:02:50,800
Not sure what you are lucky.

414
01:02:50,880 -> 01:02:53,160
Do not you see that others struggle to survive?

415
01:02:53,240 -> 01:02:56,960
- And you do not care.
- What are you chrzanisz?

416
01:02:57,000 -> 01:02:58,880
You had to fight?

417
01:02:58,920 -> 01:03:03,680
Everything ready.
Books fall from the sky.

418
01:03:05,040 -> 01:03:10,000
Yes, yes. Vegetables grow
in pots and so on.

419
01:03:18,080 -> 01:03:21,400
- I'm sorry.

Should, too.
Loosen the bun.

422
01:03:30,160 -> 01:03:33,160
Let your hair down.

423
01:03:35,400 -> 01:03:37,960
Stinker.

424
01:03:40,320 -> 01:03:42,760
Mom!

425
01:06:52,080 -> 01:06:55,040
Little tart!

01:07:05,520 -> 01:07:10,560
Scream.

428
01:07:13,280 -> 01:07:15,920

Louder.

430
01:07:21,640 -> 01:07:25,680
Louder, because it puts you in the ass.

431
01:07:30,360 -> 01:07:31,720
Scream!

432
01:07:31,800 -> 01:07:35,080
Louder, louder!

433
01:07:41,840 -> 01:07:44,560
Louder!

434
01:07:46,640 -> 01:07:49,120
Please!

435
01:07:49,800 -> 01:07:52,360
Let me in!

436
01:07:52,400 -> 01:07:54,720
Yes.

437
01:07:57,360 -> 01:07:59,840

01:10:22,440 -> 01:10:25,480
Umawialismy August,

444
01:10:25,520 -> 01:10:27,680
Because you will spend more time with him?

01:10:27,680 -> 01:10:29,680
The new drill?

446
01:10:29,720 -> 01:10:34,520
- Old in life you did not use.

447
01:10:45,880 -> 01:10:48,960
- We may end up?
- Yes.

448
01:10:49,040 -> 01:10:52,040

450
01:10:54,920 -> 01:10:58,080
- Who?

453
01:11:03,320 -> 01:11:07,400
- Remote though?
- Yes.

454
01:11:07,440 -> 01:11:09,520
I'll deal with it.

455
01:11:09,600 -> 01:11:12,920
I forgot about the cheese.

456
01:11:13,360 -> 01:11:15,560
- Give.
- Ulz them.

457

Lodwka go crazy with this.

458
01:11:20,720 -> 01:11:23,520
Move on.

459
01:11:24,040 -> 01:11:28,400
Although today wieczr refrain
of feminist tirade.

460
01:11:28,440 -> 01:11:31,680
I stand all day on drums
for your boss.

461
01:11:31,720 -> 01:11:34,320
It's not very feminist.

462
01:11:34,320 -> 01:11:37,200
About this mwie.

463
01:11:38,840 -> 01:11:41,840
Not my fault if I
Fuck stupidity.

464
01:11:41,880 -> 01:11:44,080
You know what I mean.

465
01:11:44,160 -> 01:11:48,600
"Anna, you know Tom Ford?
What is it? ".

466
01:11:48,720 -> 01:11:53,400
Constantly asks,
if I have discounts in stores.

467
01:11:54,720 -> 01:11:57,920
"40%? 50%?
Only 30? ".

468
01:11:57,920 -> 01:12:01,360
Do not forget
with the wife of my boss.

469
01:12:01,400 -> 01:12:05,040
Two hours to endure.

470
01:12:05,600 -> 01:12:07,560
I promise I'll talk with Florent.

471
01:12:07,560 -> 01:12:10,040
Remove the lid.

472
01:12:10,120 -> 01:12:12,880
- Have a good time.
- No!

473
01:12:12,880 -> 01:12:14,760
Well, well, what unanimity!

474
01:12:14,800 -> 01:12:16,400
Who do we have?

475
01:12:16,400 -> 01:12:19,360
Nowhere to go.
It is better to explain what wykreciles.

476
01:12:19,440 -> 01:12:22,920
- Probably not aware of something the matter.
- Do not want to end up just like you.

477
01:12:23,000 -> 01:12:26,760
You do not have four years.
Stop fooling around.

478
01:12:26,840 -> 01:12:29,040
Think about your future.

479
01:12:29,040 -> 01:12:32,360
Do ye see?

480
01:12:32,760 -> 01:12:36,200
I'm down, exposed.

481
01:12:46,760 -> 01:12:49,760
I can not stand.

482
01:12:51,600 -> 01:12:54,280
Stephane!

483
01:12:55,800 -> 01:12:59,360
Dress in pajamas.

484
01:14:47,360 -> 01:14:50,040
Pa, Ma.

485

486
01:15:03,800 -> 01:15:06,640
You think I'm so stupid?

487
01:15:06,680 -> 01:15:09,840
've Never thought that it would
you're stupid.

488
01:15:16,000 -> 01:15:18,880
The fuck, tell me,
what is this all.

489
01:15:18,880 -> 01:15:22,000
What is all this?

490
01:15:22,000 -> 01:15:24,880
Where did you get?

491
01:15:25,200 -> 01:15:29,960
It's not you bought this
for my money.

492
01:15:45,520 -> 01:15:49,720
- What happened?
- Cut his.

493
01:15:50,720 -> 01:15:54,840
Where Florent?
You let him go?

494
01:15:54,920 -> 01:15:56,840
I do not know where it went.

495
01:15:56,880 -> 01:16:00,400
It was about to break?

496
01:16:01,640 -> 01:16:04,680
Guests come in an hour.

497
01:16:04,720 -> 01:16:08,520
You could watch him better.

498
01:16:14,840 -> 01:16:17,960
I have a better watch?

499
01:16:18,000 -> 01:16:21,680
Today, something to guard.

500
01:16:21,840 -> 01:16:24,280
I decided
with this fucking family ...

501
01:16:24,280 -> 01:16:28,440
All men are watching ...
porn on computers.

502
01:16:28,520 -> 01:16:31,680
Apart from Stephane.

503
01:16:32,400 -> 01:16:34,120
Anything?

504
01:16:34,160 -> 01:16:37,320
Besides, he begins,
Having completed its shooting.

505
01:16:38,880 -> 01:16:44,480
Ever since you started writing this article,
behave strangely.

506
01:16:44,600 -> 01:16:47,640
We do what we can.

507
01:16:47,720 -> 01:16:50,040
Just that you have to say?

508
01:16:50,080 -> 01:16:52,680
It's my fault?

509
01:16:52,680 -> 01:16:55,280
What do you bury me in compiling?
I am not for your destruction.

510
01:16:55,280 -> 01:16:59,840
- Why are you screaming at me?
- Do not shout.

511
01:17:00,080 -> 01:17:03,240
Do you want me to police.

512
01:17:03,240 -> 01:17:06,240
Looking at my stuff?
Are you crazy?

513
01:17:06,280 -> 01:17:10,520
- What else?
- So you say.

514
01:17:15,280 -> 01:17:20,000
Are you crazy to the rest
from associating with whores.

515
01:17:20,000 -> 01:17:23,440
Maybe go to a psychologist.

516
01:17:23,520 -> 01:17:26,280
I'm not sure if these are whores.

517
01:17:26,320 -> 01:17:28,920
- In any case, or only one.
- Whore is a whore.

518
01:17:28,920 -> 01:17:31,080
Have you know.

519
01:17:31,120 -> 01:17:32,760
This is not the time to kltnie.

520
01:17:32,880 -> 01:17:37,280
- And when it is time?
- No dressing up?

521
01:17:37,280 -> 01:17:40,720
We all go to the whores.
They are whores?

522
01:17:46,760 -> 01:17:50,440
Why do I always run away,
when we talk?

523
01:17:50,520 -> 01:17:52,800
I?

524
01:18:02,240 -> 01:18:05,400
Do not touch me.

525
01:18:07,440 -> 01:18:12,920
You do not have the impression that the partially
carry a responsibility?

526
01:18:12,920 -> 01:18:15,400
For what?

527
01:18:16,040 -> 01:18:19,000
Anna, stop it.

528
01:18:24,040 -> 01:18:27,880
What do you do outside work?

529
01:18:32,000 -> 01:18:34,600
Right.

530
01:19:19,200 -> 01:19:22,040
All right?

531
01:19:52,600 -> 01:19:54,880
You have a bathroom with a view?

532
01:19:54,960 -> 01:19:57,720
With a view?

533
01:19:58,000 -> 01:19:58,720
Yes.

534
01:19:58,800 -> 01:20:02,120
They never thought about it.

535
01:20:02,200 -> 01:20:05,560
- Why?
- I was.

536
01:20:06,920 -> 01:20:12,000
What in all this is
for you the hardest?

537
01:20:14,480 -> 01:20:17,200
Lies.

538
01:20:18,960 -> 01:20:22,240
We constantly have to lie.

539
01:20:27,520 -> 01:20:31,480
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

540
01:20:31,480 -> 01:20:34,160
I can ...?

541
01:20:36,000 -> 01:20:39,720
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

542
01:20:41,240 -> 01:20:44,320
My name is Charlotte.

543
01:20:44,360 -> 01:20:47,400
Lola is just ...

544
01:20:47,600 -> 01:20:49,560
Goodbye.

545
01:20:49,600 -> 01:20:52,320
Thank you.

546
01:21:30,440 -> 01:21:33,480
It was delicious.

547
01:21:37,560 -> 01:21:39,760
£ exactly look like.

548
01:21:39,800 -> 01:21:43,760
For me you are so sexy?

549
01:21:48,040 -> 01:21:52,400
- You should not wrcic to guests?
- We will take of themselves.

550
01:21:52,480 -> 01:21:55,400
Sam continued.

551
01:21:59,120 -> 01:22:01,600
Not too hot?

552
01:22:01,680 -> 01:22:03,760
Delicious.

553
01:22:03,800 -> 01:22:06,520
When you have a wedding crki?

554
01:22:06,520 -> 01:22:09,240
- Not yet.
- Wkrtce.

555
01:22:09,240 -> 01:22:11,600
- Soon.
- Today no one gets.

556
01:22:11,600 -> 01:22:13,120
But of course!

557
01:22:13,200 -> 01:22:16,640
I was in London.
There are rare.

558
01:22:16,680 -> 01:22:21,040
- Get married.
- He is an Englishman?

559
01:22:22,800 -> 01:22:26,000
You can talk to you.

560
01:22:26,240 -> 01:22:29,040
There have not yet decided.

561
01:22:29,120 -> 01:22:32,400
Who Contenac Bran?

562
01:22:32,560 -> 01:22:35,720
Is excellent.

563
01:22:36,680 -> 01:22:40,760
Contenac, a beautiful French name.

564
01:22:43,400 -> 01:22:46,440
I like Margot.

565
01:22:47,760 -> 01:22:50,240
Dolac?

566
01:22:50,280 -> 01:22:52,720
Thank you.

567
01:22:52,760 -> 01:22:59,600
I've thought about this for a feed company is committed to
in sponsoring an exhibition of paintings.

568
01:23:04,000 -> 01:23:09,320
Anne will tell you.
I wrote an article about an artist.

569
01:23:12,200 -> 01:23:17,800
I have written about many artists.
But this exhibition is, specific.

570
01:23:40,640 -> 01:23:42,800
/ This is a song

571
01:23:42,800 -> 01:23:45,800
/ Similar to us

572
01:23:46,600 -> 01:23:49,520
/ You love me

573
01:23:50,040 -> 01:23:52,920
/ I loved you

574
01:23:53,520 -> 01:23:56,520
/ ¯ a ylismy

575
01:23:57,240 -> 01:24:00,240
/ Together with a friend

576
01:24:00,640 -> 01:24:03,560
/ You love me

577
01:24:04,200 -> 01:24:07,080
/ I loved you

578
01:24:08,720 -> 01:24:13,400
/ But life separates of those who are in love

579
01:24:15,600 -> 01:24:18,320
/ After quietly,

580
01:24:18,360 -> 01:24:21,360
/ Silently

581
01:24:22,760 -> 01:24:26,000
/ Wave washes sand

582
01:24:30,120 -> 01:24:34,080
/ Traces separated by hearts

583
01:25:20,040 -> 01:25:21,720
I ... I do not.

584
01:25:21,800 -> 01:25:26,400
On the beach, all stripped,
and I was under an umbrella.

585
01:25:26,400 -> 01:25:32,920
- Why there, you follow?
- Good question. Probably for the company.

586
01:25:33,760 -> 01:25:38,000
My friends love
trips to the bosom of nature.

587
01:25:38,000 -> 01:25:41,440
Sometimes going with them.

588
01:25:43,200 -> 01:25:48,320
- Will you come with us in the summer?
- That's what mwie.

589
01:25:50,920 -> 01:25:53,640
I'm sorry.

590
01:26:05,280 -> 01:26:09,800
It's no big deal.
Stress, deadlines pila.

591
01:26:10,520 -> 01:26:13,400
Who lettuce?

592
01:26:14,360 -> 01:26:16,520
Maybe once dessert?

593
01:26:16,560 -> 01:26:18,880
Is prepared.

594
01:26:18,880 -> 01:26:22,440
- Get it.
- If you insist.

595
01:26:22,480 -> 01:26:26,040
But if so, and cheese.

596
01:27:46,360 -> 01:27:50,360
I was afraid of you.
Where were you?

597
01:28:09,960 -> 01:28:12,640
What are you doing?

598
01:28:13,560 -> 01:28:16,320
Something for us.

599
01:28:27,720 -> 01:28:30,200
Stand up.

600
01:28:37,840 -> 01:28:40,560
I can not.

601
01:29:18,320 -> 01:29:21,160
Morning.

602
01:29:32,600 -> 01:29:35,560
Wyspalas August?

603
01:29:44,640 -> 01:29:48,320
- Thanks.

604
01:30:10,280 -> 01:30:13,200
