01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:21,677
* With next to nothing on

1196
01:31:21,777 --> 01:31:25,848
* We'd jump
the swinging fence *

1197
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:30,252
* As lightning takes the stage

1198
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:34,523
* It takes with it our clothes

1199
01:31:34,623 --> 01:31:38,594
* And this is what we made

1200
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:42,698
* A dream to drift along

1201
01:31:42,798 --> 01:31:47,335
* A tempest passing through

1202
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:51,206
* These resilient trees

1203
01:31:51,306 --> 01:31:54,610
* Older than me or you

1204
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:58,647
* When I dream of love *
