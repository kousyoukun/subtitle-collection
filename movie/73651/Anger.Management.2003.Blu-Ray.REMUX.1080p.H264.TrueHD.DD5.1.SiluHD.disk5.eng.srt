1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,231
That's your solution for everything.
The guy's homeless, right?

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,233
Let him be. Set your anger free.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,641
Look at you, Lou. You've really calmed
down since working with Dr. B.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,744
-We all have.
-Hey, fellas.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,405
Could you bring it down a little bit?

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,414
We're trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,348
-This is a free country!
-What's going on with you?!

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,782
-Are you crazy?!
-Go in! Just go in.

9
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,793
Goosfraba! Goosfraba!

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,020
Goosfraba.

11
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,822
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,331
I need to see Dr. B. I'm in crisis.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,164
He's not here.
Why don't you go look for him?

14
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:42,798
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by
and she dropped these off for you.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,444
Those are her keys to my apartment.

16
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,843
I think your girlfriend's cheating
on you.

17
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,845
-Why?
-I heard her on her cell phone...

18
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,714
...talking to a guy...

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,486
-...making a date.
-I'm so sorry, Dave.

20
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,324
Andrew.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,754
I'll kill that guy.

22
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,662
She ain't cheating on me by the way.
We agreed to take a break.

23
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,325
She's not taking a break
from the old sausage, huh?

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,892
Sorry.

25
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,935
She's meeting the Andrew at Mort's
on 86th Street now...

26
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,370
...if you want to go watch.

27
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,709
No. No, I can't do that.

28
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,341
We're here.

29
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,117
-Both of you showed up?
-You like Stacy better or something?

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,454
It's just that I want to go on a fake
date to get my girlfriend jealous...

31
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,789
...so I really only needed
one of you guys.

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,964
Well, now she'll be twice as jealous.

33
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,293
-So do you know the guy she's with?
-I think I might.

34
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,766
Let me ask you something.

35
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,135
Because of your profession
you probably have seen a lot of them.

36
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,642
Does size count at all, or is that just
some weird thing guys think about?

37
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,680
This is where Gina and I
always get into a heated debate.

38
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,680
I like them when they're really big.

39
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,547
And I think it's better
when they're enormous.

40
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,027
Good evening.

41
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,323
Table for three?

42
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,365
-May we take your coats?
-No. We're okay.

43
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,867
The girls are gonna
take their coats off.

44
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,198
Would you like a boobs--? Booth?

45
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,007
Actually, could you give us a table
overlooking that table right there?

46
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,149
-Sure. Right this way.
-Thank you.

47
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,912
Oh, my God. It's Stacy and Gina.

48
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,488
Who?

49
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,182
Nobody.

50
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,623
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.

51
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,452
Yummy. Yummy.

52
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,290
-Let's get wasted tonight.
-Definitely.

53
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,630
Have fun.
Lucky son of a bitch.

54
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,739
What?

55
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,438
I can't believe this.

56
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,943
Excuse me.

57
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:04,777
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I
didn't know you were going to be here.

58
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,419
I guess not. Are those your friends?

59
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,354
I'm supposed to date other people
so I figured I'd give it a try.

60
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,354
Gina, can you stop sucking
on Stacy's finger for one second?

61
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,694
I want to introduce you to somebody.

62
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,602
-Stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
-Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,534
And I'd like you to meet my date.

64
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,873
Ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.

65
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,142
-Look, Dave, it's Buddy.
-I see.

66
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,250
-You know Stacy and Gina?
-Yes, yes, I do.

67
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,148
We're in Dave's anger group.
Fury Fighters!

68
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,350
Well, gee whiz.
Here's your Rémy, Linda.

69
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,493
This is a bit awkward.

70
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,219
I mean, group members...

71
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,830
...are not supposed to get
romantically involved.

72
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,934
-Yeah! I agree with that.
-You know that.

73
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,196
I'd like to talk to you alone
for a second.

74
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,103
There's a rage control technique I'd
like to go over with you right now.

75
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,937
Of course. Excuse me--

76
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,503
What?

77
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,949
-Two of the usual, Duke.
-Coming right up, Dr. B.

78
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,985
You're the biggest backstabbing
piece of crap I ever met.

79
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,115
What are you saying?

80
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm trying to give you a hand.
It's my job.

81
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,320
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!

82
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,860
My job is trying to prevent
Mr. Andrew...

83
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,966
...from unleashing the Whopper
with Cheese.

84
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,163
That's right. Since you've
been out of the picture...

85
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,033
...Andrew's been burning up the wires
night and day...

86
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,799
...trying to rekindle those
hotsie-totsie nights up at Brown U.

87
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,844
-How would you know?
-You think I only tapped your phone?

88
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,514
What was she saying?

89
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,481
The good news is, I already launched
a preemptive strike.

90
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,485
Now the situation is contained.

91
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,646
You and I control the game.

92
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,880
How?

93
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,392
I will be uncharacteristically
aggressively boring.

94
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,498
I keep talking about myself,
acting arrogant and obnoxious.

95
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,666
When Linda sees what
the dating world is really like...

96
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,499
...then guess who comes out
smelling like a white mushroom?

97
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,846
-You swear to me this will work?
-The ball's already up in the air.

98
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,014
Incidentally, nice move
bringing the girls.

99
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,676
Very strong. Come on.

100
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,550
I'll see you at home
in a half-hour, keed.

101
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,593
That's 25 dollars, pal.

102
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,524
We don't....

103
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,462
Where were you? It's 1:00.

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,830
When you hear what happened, you'll
bow down and worship me like a god.

105
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,131
-Better be good. Give it to me.
-Okay.

106
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,366
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus--

107
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,103
The bus? You took the bus?
What happened to your car?

108
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,906
I was way too smashed to drive.

109
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:26,314
I told her I didn't want to waste money
on a cab. That did not go down well.

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,877
Okay. I like that.

111
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,216
So we get to her house...

112
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,721
...we have some kind of a weird
argument...

113
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,228
...about the number of syllables
in a haiku.

114
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,763
Poetry garbage.

115
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,332
She said it was getting late,
we kissed and I headed on home.

116
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,204
Now, you say you kissed?

117
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,069
It was nothing. Little five-second kiss.
That's all.

118
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,733
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

119
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,469
You're having this horrible evening.

120
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:58,084
-How do you end up kissing, again?
-I wish I knew, keed.

121
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,845
We were both pretty geezed up.

122
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,921
One second we're fighting,
and the next second we're laughing...

123
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,490
...and then just a quick
10-second kiss.

124
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,129
I thought that you said five seconds.

125
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,958
First it was a five-second one...

126
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,499
...and then a little break because
my beard gave her a tickle.

127
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,634
She's cute.
And then a 10-second Frencher.

128
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,005
You had your crazy, corroded tongue
in my girlfriend's mouth?

129
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,545
Just a second. Just one second, Dave.

130
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,579
Dr. B, let it bip.

131
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,345
Well, hello.

132
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,520
I shouldn't really talk right now.

133
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,854
Well, I suppose you're right.

134
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,094
It's got to be done.

135
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,928
Who was that? Linda?

136
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:56,201
I've got some good news for you
and some potentially upsetting news.

137
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,207
First, the good news.

138
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm going to sign your papers.
You're a free man.

139
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,444
Let me hear
the potentially upsetting news.

140
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,110
Linda and I have fallen
for one another.

141
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,721
Pretty hard too.

142
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,116
David, I hope you believe me
when I say this:

143
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,124
I didn't intend for this to happen.

144
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,059
It was no one's fault, I guess.
It was just--

145
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,789
Wait a minute.

146
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,838
I figured this out.

147
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,245
You're messing with me.

148
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,643
I wish I were, Dave.

149
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,985
However, I did insist that we not
go forward without your blessing...

150
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:47,092
...because we're best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?

151
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,494
Is it all right if I date your ex?

152
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,493
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.

153
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,332
I am appalled by your assault
on Dr. Rydell.

154
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,907
Obviously, anger management
has been a complete failure for you.

155
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:07,035
I'm setting a trial date for 3 weeks
from today for attempted murder.

156
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,979
As for Dr. Rydell's safety,
I'm issuing a restraining order.

157
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,484
Which means that at no time can you
come within 500 feet of him...

158
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,020
...or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.

159
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,919
Court is adjourned.

160
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,673
Coming, Peaches.

161
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,983
Are you kidding me?

162
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,788
Numb-nuts, where's the catalog
for my Fat Cat clothing line?

163
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,432
I said I'd have it by 3.

164
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,265
-Okay.
-Get in gear.

165
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm so sorry I'm late.

166
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,171
I hope you have it.
My presentation's in two hours.

167
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,439
What's this? Your fat-shit cat's
been sitting there all day.

168
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,148
Don't worry about him.

169
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,218
Here you go.
I think you're gonna like it.

170
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,685
It's good stuff.

171
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,430
That's a good picture, I think.

172
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,597
What the hell is this?!

173
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,828
You keep telling everybody you
created the Husky Cat line.

174
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,505
I thought you'd want your picture
in there. No?

175
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,972
Question: Can I get two couches
in my office?

176
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,771
If friends come over, I want them
to feel comfortable.

177
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,003
What office?

178
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,549
Frank was nice enough to give me
some creative executive position.

179
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,422
-You gave him the job that I wanted?
-He earned it.

180
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,057
Why can't you be happy for me?
Linda's gonna be.

181
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,089
Know something?
I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.

182
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,753
She dumped you 15 years ago.
Get over it.

183
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,330
I wouldn't worry about me.

184
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,696
It's your pal Buddy who's taking her
to the Yankee game tonight.

185
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,903
Yankee game.

186
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,334
Did he steal my proposal idea?

187
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,637
Buznik, your behavior
is unacceptable.

188
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,677
Unacceptable?

189
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:27,342
I've been getting your coffee and
doing your work for five years now.

190
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,647
When a good position
actually opens up...

191
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,289
...you give it to the biggest dick
in the world?

192
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,395
I don't know about the world, but it's
definitely the biggest one in the room.

193
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,426
Now, when I started here...

194
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,602
...I was promised advancement
opportunities.

195
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,931
And breaking that promise, to me,
is unacceptable.

196
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,836
You see? I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.

197
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,310
So when I get out of jail, sometime
in the next two to five years...

198
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:01,250
...I expect you to give me the position
that Andrew just resigned from.

199
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,219
-Okay.
-Great.

200
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,551
Have fun looking like Colonel Klink.

201
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,756
By the way, his name is not
Fat-shit Cat, it's Meatball...

202
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,594
...and he's eating your crab cakes
right now.

203
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,443
-You starting to get excited?
-Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.

204
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,273
This is going to be some night.

205
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,845
Come on. Come on.

206
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,891
-Dr. B, how's it going?
-Very well, thank you.

207
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,558
Always a thrill. Right this way.

208
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,864
Where the hell's a spot?
Where's a spot?

209
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,266
Whoa! Watch it, man!

210
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:55,608
Your attention, please.

211
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,041
Your attention, please.

212
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,041
Before tonight's National Anthem...

213
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,272
...Metropolitan Opera star Robert
Merrill...

214
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:07,215
...will present a special moment
for two special people.

215
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,444
I love when they do this.

216
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,153
-Good.
-Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.

217
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,200
Linda?! Linda!

218
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,296
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

219
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,723
Wait, don't I know you?

220
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,835
-Come on.
-Where's your German accent?

221
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,439
You have me confused
with somebody--

222
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,272
I wanna get on the field.
I'm a fan of Mr. Merrill's.

223
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,074
-There's no fans allowed on that field.
-Galaxia.

224
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,138
It's Gary.

225
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,980
Whatever. Someone else will marry
my woman if you don't let me go.

226
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,583
-Hebrew Melvin's in love.
-Very much.

227
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,253
I can't stop love.

228
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,259
-Go.
-Thank you.

229
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:30,031
Don't think I don't owe you
a couple smacks by the way.

230
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,971
Good evening. Tonight, romance
comes to Yankee Stadium.

231
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,542
Oh, my God, it's Dave.

232
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,843
What the heck are you doing here?

233
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,515
-I wanna borrow this for a second.
-That's my mike!

234
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,174
Linda? Where are you?

235
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,183
Don't move.

236
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,112
Linda? Are you out there, honey?

237
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,717
Linda, I'm not mad at you.

238
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,124
Oh, shit.

239
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,726
I know that crazy man
brought you here.

240
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,873
Davey's going crazy!

241
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,805
I've done crazier stuff than that
to win back a chick.

242
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,070
Once I ran naked
through a subway station.

243
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,645
How was that supposed to work?

244
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,548
I guess I never really
thought it through.

245
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,716
I gotta tell you something personal!

246
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,481
This kid lost his marbles.

247
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,949
I'm over here!

248
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,896
Linda, think about
what you're doing to us.

249
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,060
Sweet tackle. Wow!

250
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,170
Dave just got leveled!

251
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,834
-Nobody messes with my microphone.
-I'm sorry.

252
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,441
Bob?

253
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,843
-Everything all right, Buddy?
-Oh, yeah.

254
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,778
I've never seen you so excited.

255
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,714
It's not every day a man
gets to propose marriage...

256
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,410
...to the woman he loves.

257
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,421
Now, here's what I want you to write
on the scoreboard.

258
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:02,425
Linda! Linda, I've loved you
since the day I met you!

259
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,756
I won't let you do this to us!

260
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,064
Don't marry him!

261
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,868
Don't marry him!

262
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,001
Wait!

263
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,468
Let this man finish
what he came here to say.

264
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,605
Let the man back in.

265
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,043
-Who was that guy?
-I think it's Regis Philbin.

266
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,747
Thank you, Mayor Giuliani.
You're the man, by the way.

267
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,490
This clown better hurry up.
My arm's starting to ice over.

268
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,149
Chill, Rocket. Goosfraba.

269
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,693
Goosfraba.

270
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,431
Goosfraba.

271
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:46,102
I can understand why you wanted
to see other people. I really can.

272
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,963
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!

273
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,807
But he was right about one thing.

274
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,103
I was an angry guy.

275
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,809
Mainly angry at myself...

276
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,044
...for letting people treat me like crap
all the time.

277
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,978
But I don't want to be that angry guy
anymore.

278
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,556
I wanna change.

279
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,223
If you give me a chance...

280
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,227
...I can show you that I got the guts
to stand up for what I believe in.

281
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,989
And I believe in us, Linda.

282
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:17,430
I love you with all my heart,
and I know you love me back.

283
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,965
I should be your husband...

284
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,303
...not that weirdo.

285
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:28,611
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.

286
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,614
Kids who have your eyes...

287
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,183
...and your lips...

288
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,117
...and my...

289
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,982
...last name.
That's all I wish on them.

290
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,593
Please marry me, Linda.

291
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,803
Before I make my decision,
you have to do something for me.

292
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,671
You have to kiss me
in front of all these people!

293
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,550
You can do it, David!

294
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,716
Give her a five-second Frencher!

295
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,891
Kiss her, David.

296
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,492
Kiss her, David.

297
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,231
Kiss her, David!

298
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,296
Kiss her, David.

299
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,939
Go Yankees!

300
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,494
Dave's a dirty boy.

301
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,262
That wasn't so bad, was it?

302
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:04,141
I can't believe you actually
started to fall for that crazy man.

303
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,676
Buddy's not such a bad guy.

304
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,281
Congratulations! You just graduated
from anger management!

305
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,537
I'm glad your car died.
The train's romantic.

306
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,237
Don't change the subject.

307
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:47,284
You're telling me the past two weeks
of my life was just therapy?

308
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,714
Well....

309
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,110
Yeah.

310
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,583
I met with Buddy
after reading his book...

311
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,125
...and I told him about some
of the things going on in your life...

312
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:01,289
...and how upset it was making you
and how nuts it was making me.

314
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,463

00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,008
Well, the guy in your seat on the

316
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,170
...they're all friends of Buddy's.

317
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,715

00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,431

321
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,498
Buddy Rydell, you're a great man.
