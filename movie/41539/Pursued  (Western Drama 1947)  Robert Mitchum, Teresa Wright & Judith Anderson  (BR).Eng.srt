1
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,152
Jeb?

2
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,224
Jeb, where are you?

3
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,538
Oh!

4
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,550
Are you all right?
I'm all right.

5
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:20,492
I brought you some things - some
meal and beans and a good canteen.

6
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,230
Is that what kept you-
getting those things?

7
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,267
I came as soon as I could.

8
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,473
I brought you a map too.
Look.

9
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,447
If you work up north through the
Gloriettas, you can hit the Skin Road.

10
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:36,087
<i>If I work north? What about you?
Yes, Jeb.</i>

11
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:40,429
Where will you be?
I'm not going with you.

12
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,900
I knew it as soon
as you came in...

13
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,707
By the look on your face
and the way you walked.

14
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,844
You've always been like that-

15
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:53,118
Able to think with my thoughts
and feel with my feelings.

16
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:55,891
But there's something
that keeps us apart.

17
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,129
Oh, Jeb, what happened to us?
Why did everything go wrong?

18
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:04,072
I don't know all of it,
but I know some.

19
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,546
I've been thinking
and figuring.

20
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,116
This is where it started, this
is where it's going to end.

21
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:13,573
You see that rise?
He'll be coming over that.

22
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,744
He'll come killing.

23
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:23,624
Come out,
or we'll come in after ya!

24
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:26,897
You hear it?

25
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:32,474
Jeb, honey,
there's no one out there.

26
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:35,748
You're imagining.
I'm not imagining.

27
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,418
Remembering.

28
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:42,159
Putting together what happened-
what I guess must've happened.

29
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,930
Thor, it's all coming
back, strong and clear.

30
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:47,770
There's an answer in it.

31
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,707
There's something about me
that explains everything.

32
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:54,047
Jeb, I don't understand. I'm
gonna make you understand.

33
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:58,589
I've got to
before they get here.

34
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:01,360
Do you know why
I came to this place?

35
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:04,967
No, Jeb, but...
It's not a good hideout.

36
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:07,538
They're sure
to trail you here.

37
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:10,278
I came for another reason.

38
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:14,218
I was here before, long ago.

39
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:17,057
I was a baby then.

40
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,829
I was scared the way
only a kid can get.

41
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,503
I was in a dark, cold place.

42
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,381
I had my eyes closed to get
away from some bad dream-

43
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,419
The same dream
I'd been having all my life.

44
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:37,711
I've never understood it. There
were boots running, flashes.

45
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,715
Daddy? Daddy?

46
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,653
But my father wasn't there.

47
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:45,492
Instead, a strange woman
was lying on the floor.

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,629
She crawled toward me.

49
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:50,000
That was the first time
I saw your mother.

50
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:13,721
Get up, son. No, Jeb,
you can't go to sleep now.

51
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,760
Get your clothes on, son. We're
going away from here. Who is that?

52
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:21,202
That's Jeb Rand. Now, pay
attention, Adam... And Thor.

53
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,174
This is Jeb.
He's going to live with us.

54
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:26,445
Come on, now.
Help your sister.

55
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,604
They've gone,
every danged one of 'em.

56
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,641
They've moved away somewhere.

57
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,678
Grant, if you ride with
that arm, you'll lose it.

58
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:43,019
I'll find 'em if it takes me
to the end of my life.

59
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,626
The idea that I was hiding or
running away never quite died out.

60
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:51,001
It should have, I guess, because
the next seven years I wasn't hiding.

61
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,272
Your ma was
taking care of all of us.

62
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,376
I was growing up
with you and Adam,

63
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:59,883
Going to school, helping to build a
house in the new place we moved to,

64
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:02,889
Having the whole outdoors
for a playground.

65
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:07,415
I'd about stopped having nightmares until
one day when I was about nine or ten.

66
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:44,367
Look, Jeb!
A little black chick.

67
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:47,038
I found him under the house.

68
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,116
What's the matter with you?

69
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,975
You know what's the matter!
You shot the colt!

70
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,355
Shot what colt?
Are you crazy?

71
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,198
Mom!

72
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,604
<i>Jeb, stop!</i>

73
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,608
Stop!

74
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,650
Mom! Mom, they're fighting again! Mom!

75
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,604
Now, stop that fighting, boys!
Stop that fighting!

76
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:25,209
Now, stop it!
Stop that fighting, boys!

77
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:27,212
Thor, pump some water.

78
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:41,573
Now, stop it! Come on, boys!
Now, stop that fighting!

79
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,709
Come on!
Stop it!

80
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,713
Adam! Jeb!

81
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:50,121
Now, what's it all about?

82
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,393
He shot the colt.
I didn't!

83
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,396
You did so! You mean
somebody shot our colt?

84
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:57,635
Said it was his.
He said I couldn't ride it.

85
00:09:57,703 --> 00:10:00,408
But I rode it anyway.
He took a shot at it.

86
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,846
Or maybe me.
I don't know.

87
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:07,086
But anyway,
he killed the colt.

88
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:10,492
No. Somebody may have killed
him, but it wasn't Adam.

89
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,565
He's been here all morning
greasing the buckboard.

90
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,670
You say somebody took a shot at
you? Who could it have been, ma?

91
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:22,949
Well, I don't rightly know.

92
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:24,952
Matter of fact, there were some
deer hunters hanging around.

93
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,525
Yes, sir. They asked me if
they could hunt down our fence,

94
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,529
And I told 'em yes.

95
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:35,338
You go and get your supper off
the stove, and no more fightin'.

96
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,476
You gonna see those men, ma?
That's right.

97
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,480
Put that wheel back on.

98
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,499
So, you found us.

99
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,304
You covered up
your trail pretty well.

100
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:23,077
As soon as the boy told me
somebody tried to kill him,

101
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,080
I knew it was you.

102
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:31,525
Being a lawyer hasn't done
your shootin' any good, Grant.

103
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:34,999
Yeah. Maybe losin' this some
years ago didn't help any either.

104
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,002
You owe me for a colt.

105
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,247
Doggone critter
was too lively.

106
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,921
When he crawled off,
he spoiled my aim.

107
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:49,959
You can't start it all over
again, Grant. I won't let you.

108
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:52,396
You're gettin' kind
of uppity, ain't you?

109
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:56,771
He's a Rand. I knew it the
first minute I laid eyes on him.

110
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,078
He brought to mind that you
was married to my brother.

111
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:02,115
And a score still isn't
settled for his death.

112
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,454
You lost a brother,
I lost a husband.

113
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,458
I don't want
any more vengeance for him.

114
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,965
I never figured
that you would.

115
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:14,704
That's why I swore that
I'd kill every Rand on earth.

116
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:16,942
And he's the only one left.

117
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,946
How in tarnation
you get him?

118
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,351
Let's say the lord
gave him to me.

119
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,592
Let the boy alone, Grant.
He's innocent.

120
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,628
That night ended it for him.

121
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,632
A night like that
don't have an end.

122
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,337
What happened to him there
will make him do things just-

123
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:34,474
Just like spirits were
whispering in his ear saying,

124
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,612
"kill, kill.
You've got to kill."

125
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,021
Spirits may talk to you, but they won't
to him. I don't believe in your spirits.

126
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,959
Maybe not, but someday you'll wish
I hadn't missed my shot today...

127
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:47,799
Down on the draw. That's
one day that'll never come.

128
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,939
He's a good boy.
I love him like my own son.

129
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,878
What makes you think
that boy loves you?

130
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:02,760
Well... I'll go back
to Santa Fe.

131
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:06,600
I swear I think I'll leave that
Rand alone, let him grow up,

132
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:10,541
Just to see what happens to you when he's
big enough to start asking questions.

133
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,519
Don't forget your money
for the colt.

134
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,129
Thanks for reminding me.

135
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:24,133
This'll help me bring him up.

136
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:40,730
Did you find 'em, ma?
Did you talk to 'em?

137
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:43,936
Why, sure I did. It was
them deer hunters all right.

138
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:46,841
They shot the colt.

139
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,713
Put the team up, Adam, and
feed 'em. You help him, Thor.

140
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:52,152
Come in the house with me,
son. I want to talk to you.

141
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,619
Jeb, how much
do you remember...

142
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,855
About coming
to live with us-

143
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:14,859
About the night
I brought you here?

144
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:20,370
You must remember something. Not much.

145
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:22,708
You can tell me, Jeb.

146
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,848
I get mixed up
when I think about that.

147
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,455
I remember flashes...

148
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,692
And boots runnin'.

149
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,700
You know your parents are
dead. That's why I took you in.

150
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,972
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,246
But you don't remember them?
No, ma'am.

152
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:47,154
Sometimes I try to think
about it. I don't know.

153
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:51,361
My head hurts.

154
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:54,031
It gets all blurred.

155
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:57,638
Sometimes
the lord protects us...

156
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:00,444
By letting us know
only what's needful.

157
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:03,383
What you don't remember
doesn't matter.

158
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,387
You belong here with us now.

159
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:08,393
Don't ask questions
of the past.

160
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,330
It has no answers for you.

161
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,970
Grow up strong in the love
that's here for you.

162
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,609
As long as you love in
return, nothing can happen.

163
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,979
And you do love us,
don't you, Jeb?

164
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,559
I'm sorry
I started the fight.

165
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,696
Well, son,

166
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:31,601
After today you boys won't
have anything to fight about.

167
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,614
Adam, Thor, come here.

168
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,555
Now, pay heed to me,
you children.

169
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:45,694
I'll have no more arguments as
to who owns what on this ranch,

170
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:47,698
colts or anything else.

171
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:50,102
Everything we have
or ever will have...

172
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,406
Belongs to you three
from this day on.

173
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,211
You mean, everything has
to be that way? Yes, Adam.

174
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,248
Have you any objection
to that?

175
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:01,189
Not for Thor and me,
but I have for outsiders.

176
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:06,483
There are no outsiders here.

177
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:09,020
You three are together.
You yourselves...

178
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:13,228
Are the best and finest
thing there is-a family.

179
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,305
You promise
not to forget that?

180
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,581
I mean all three of you.

181
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,321
All right.
Thor, stop scratching.

182
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,260
Go in the house and get some coal
oil, put it on those chiggers.

183
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:32,264
Adam, you find
the sheep scissors.

184
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:35,569
I'm gonna cut yours
and Jeb's hair tonight.

185
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:38,809
Jeb, we've always called you
by your right name, Rand.

186
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,813
Would you like to use
our name instead?

187
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,455
If you don't mind, I'd like to
use my own name. Jeb Rand.

188
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,135
All right, Jeb.

189
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,245
You know how it was
after that.

190
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:19,485
Ma's idea worked like she
wanted it, pretty near.

191
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,889
Anyhow, we seemed
more like a family.

192
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:24,260
We were close,
the four of us.

193
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,331
That lasted for a long time.

194
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,870
It lasted until that day
I rode into town.

195
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:51,410
Detail, halt!

196
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:54,181
Right face!

197
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,419
About face!

198
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,890
<i>Order arms!</i>

199
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,263
Hey, what's all the shoutin' and
drum beatin' about? Ain't you heard?

200
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,470
The territory's fightin'
Spain, and it looks

201
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:06,729
like we're gonna have a
real shootin' war too.

202
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,484
Hi, Jeb.
Good morning, Doctor.

203
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,876
Hello, Prentice. That's quite some
excitement you've got around here.

204
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:21,465
Sure is.
Gotta beat them Spaniards.

205
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,703
Sure wish I could fight,
but dad won't let me.

206
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,574
Meanin' I won't lie about
his age so he can join.

207
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:29,079
I fought in one war. He don't
know what he's stayin' out of.

208
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:31,417
Here's your mail, Jeb.
Thanks, Bam.

209
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,755
That dress and petticoat
Thor sent for came in.

210
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:38,430
Hope it's what she wanted.
I've been keeping it for her.

211
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:41,301
She'll be obliged to you.
I'll tell her I saw you.

212
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,877
How's my credit, Bam?
I need some tobacco.

213
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:47,881
Never heard anything wrong with
the credit on the Callum ranch.

214
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:50,184
Thanks.

215
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:53,257
Mr. Rand?
Yes.

216
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:55,494
I heard him mention
the Callum ranch.

217
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:59,770
I'm, uh, State Provost, down
here to supervise recruiting.

218
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,912
Every outfit around about
here is sending in a quota.

219
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,116
One man apiece
to fight the Spaniards.

220
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:11,992
I was sort of interested to see if
anyone was coming in from your ranch.

221
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,331
Oh, I guess this is what you
mean, sir. It came a little late.

222
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,369
Some of the outfits are sending
in every danged rider they've got.

223
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,009
Except the aged and unfit.

224
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,448
We'll let you know tomorrow which one
it's gonna be - me or my brother Adam.

225
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,551
Is that soon enough?
I guess so,

226
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,123
Unless you'd like the pleasure
of riding home tonight...

227
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,127
And telling the folks
you've just joined up.

228
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:37,075
Fill this out and sign it
and hand it in when you report.

229
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:40,277
If I'm the one that reports.
If not, Adam will have to do it.

230
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,957
Give me two. The provost
seems bound and determined...

231
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,960
To get you into this war.

232
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,464
It sort of appeared
that way to me too.

233
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,601
Who is that fella anyway?
What's his name?

234
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,939
Heck, I figured you knew him.

235
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,277
Ain't he some kind of kin
of yours? No kin of mine.

236
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:01,616
I have no kin. His name's
Callum, just the same.

237
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:05,157
There's a whole slew of 'em up north.

238
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,825
<i>Halt! Order arms!</i>

239
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:26,730
<i>The recruits are ready to be
sworn in. Is that right, boys?</i>

240
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:31,371
All right.
Raise your right hands.

241
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:36,749
Repeat after me. I, a citizen of
the United States, do solemnly swear-

242
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:40,688
"I, a citizen of the United
States, do solemnly swear...

243
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:44,395
That I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the United States of America.

244
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:48,637
That I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the United States of America."

245
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:04,299
<i>Is that package for me?
Yes.</i>

246
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,305
The dry goods you ordered.
Oh, good.

247
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:09,976
Maybe it's my dress.
Hey, Adam?

248
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:13,550
<i>Hello? When you finish up
there, come on in the house.</i>

249
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,955
<i>I got some business to talk
over with you. All right.</i>

250
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,959
What is it?

251
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:28,911
<i>"... As a soldier in
the volunteer army...</i>

252
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:31,797
"of the United States
of America for a period

253
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:34,211
of two years, unless
sooner discharged.

254
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:36,425
The first company's
leaving in the morning.

255
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:39,264
I told him we'd let him
know by then. It's not fair.

256
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,006
Why can't they get
soldiers from the big

257
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,827
ranches, where there
have plenty of riders?

258
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:45,542
Can't be helped, sis. Them
Spaniards has to be beat.

259
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,863
I won't let either of you go.
I'll ride into

260
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:50,040
town and explain we
need both of you here.

261
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:52,121
You can only keep
one of us at home, sis.

262
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:55,861
But you can help pick which one it's
gonna be. That's a job I don't want.

263
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:58,432
Should we tell ma,
or decide without her?

264
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,936
Decide for ourselves, I say.

265
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:03,809
Tell her after.

266
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,812
Well, ad, what do you say?
How are we gonna settle it?

267
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,618
I'm agreeable
to anything you suggest.

268
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:11,856
All right, I'll draw numbers with
you, run you a race or cut cards.

269
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:13,860
That would be your way
of deciding it.

270
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:17,133
This isn't a game. It's
serious. I'm serious.

271
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,774
How about a toss? That's the
quickest. That's fine with me.

272
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,813
Then let me toss it.
Flip it high.

273
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:28,789
If it's tails, ad goes.

274
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,825
Heads, it's Jeb.

275
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:44,417
It's heads.
Jeb, you're the one.

276
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:49,728
It was a fair toss.

277
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,731
So be it.

278
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:54,034
Well, there's no use
stalling around any longer.

279
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:57,341
Adam, will you cut out
a horse for me? Sure.

280
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,181
I'll get going tonight. I
better go to ma now and tell her.

281
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:36,046
Don't let anything
happen to you, Jeb.

282
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:39,319
I couldn't stand that. If
anything happened to you-

283
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:41,322
Nothing's gonna happen, ma.

284
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:44,127
I'll come back.

285
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:46,833
Why, sure, I know you will.

286
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,070
One of you had to go.

287
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,307
Perhaps it's best this way.

288
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,634
Good-bye, Jeb.

289
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:10,710
Good-bye, ma.

290
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:56,828
Good-bye, Jeb.
So long.

291
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,932
Come home, Jeb.

292
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,739
Until I do, maybe you'd
like this for a keepsake.

293
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:05,343
I guess it sort of
slipped out of your hand.

294
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:07,748
Right through the window too.

295
00:25:07,817 --> 00:25:10,453
It didn't slip.
I threw it.

296
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:14,728
I don't blame you. You wanted to keep
Adam here, so you lied about the toss.

297
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:18,367
I wanted to lie,
but I didn't.

298
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:21,406
If I had, it would've been
to keep you here,

299
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:24,278
Not Adam.

300
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:27,351
You felt that way too?
The same way I felt.

301
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,060
I was supposed
to be your sister.

302
00:25:32,128 --> 00:25:34,497
That's how it's been
ever since we were kids.

303
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,004
Only I stopped being
your sister,

304
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:40,575
And you've never been
my brother.

305
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:43,748
But I had to go on
every day pretending,

306
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:47,555
Watching you all day,
letting you touch me,

307
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:49,559
And at night
going in my room,

308
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,797
Lying there,
thinking about you.

309
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:55,203
I wish I had lied.

310
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,576
I wish I had cheated about
the toss and kept you here.

311
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,625
Wait for me.
You know I will.

312
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:24,490
I'll leave him at the ace high livery
stable. Pick him up in the morning.

313
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,729
So long. Give them Spaniards
heck for me. I'll do that.

314
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:57,751
Come on!

315
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,809
Feel any better?

316
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:40,847
I feel all right. Well, I don't
know whether you were lucky or not.

317
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:43,285
You were sure
dreaming something.

318
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:45,289
I've heard a lot
of fever chatter in my time.

319
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:49,396
Don't bother with it much when it's concerned
with war, but yours was different.

320
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:52,302
Seemed to come from way back
somewhere when you were a kid.

321
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,400
What'd I say?

322
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:56,216
Something about boots
and flashes of light.

323
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,348
<i>Somebody hurt or killed.</i>

324
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:02,488
<i>Does that mean anything
to you? I don't know.</i>

325
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,359
But you gotta tell me what I said,
doc. Every word. I wanna know.

326
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:07,697
Don't upset yourself.
Your fever's gone,

327
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:09,844
And the nightmare is with it
wherever they came from.

328
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,372
<i>That leg is gonna
get you home.</i>

329
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,376
Home?

330
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:04,152
The stage is in!

331
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,428
No, no. The provost wants to pay for it.

332
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:12,467
Oh, thank you, sir,
for the treat.

333
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:18,678
It's a pleasure to treat a man who takes
so little interest in today's occasion.

334
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:22,452
See, personally, I too have
small interests in a doggone hero.

335
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,956
We think a great deal of Jeb
out at the ranch.

336
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:28,730
Too bad they don't have a brass
band for a good cattle tally.

337
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:30,758
Understand you've been doing
a fine job out there.

338
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:32,737
I don't believe
I know your name, sir.

339
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,744
It's the same as yours - Callum.
I'm the prosecutor at Santa Fe.

340
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:40,519
We're kin, you know. Then I'm
glad to make your acquaintance.

341
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:44,025
Listen to that.

342
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:48,500
The ladies deprecate killing, but
my, how they admire a war hero.

343
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:52,341
Jeb, you know, comes by
his instincts naturally.

344
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:55,963
He inherited them.
Is that so?

345
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:58,868
I don't believe I ever talked to
anyone who knew Jeb Rand's kinfolk.

346
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:02,642
Sometime, take a little ride for
yourself up into Glorietta Township...

347
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:07,552
And see what the records have
to say about a family named Rand.

348
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,623
Good luck.

349
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:16,101
"for this meritorious
and exceptional action,

350
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:18,789
"I now award you
the Medal of Honor...

351
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:21,728
Of the United States
of America."

352
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:43,118
Good to see you, ma. My,
you're looking fine.

353
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,491
Hello, Thor.
Hello, Jeb.

354
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:52,167
<i>Welcome home, Jeb.
Thank you, Adam.</i>

355
00:30:52,235 --> 00:30:56,175
Glad to be home. Come on. Ride up here
with me. Let's get on out to the ranch.

356
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:59,147
Once you're sleepin' in your own bed
and eatin' at your own table, Jeb,

357
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,199
Maybe you'll forget all
about the killin' and

358
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,078
shootin' the general
talked so much about.

359
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,925
Don't have to forget it, ma.

360
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:07,929
Never think about it.

361
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,637
Giddap!

362
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,971
I was savin' this
for thanksgiving.

363
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,111
I guess we're havin' a
kind of thanksgiving anyway.

364
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:41,491
Thank you. Welcome to my son, Jeb.

365
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,495
Thank you, ma.

366
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:52,111
To you, Jeb,
and you must drink to me.

367
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:56,453
<i>It would be fittin'
to have some music.</i>

368
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:00,761
Remember, boys?
"The Londonderry Air."

369
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:06,237
Why, you used to sing it.

370
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:21,098
Once more, I'll awaken

371
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:24,471
the sweetness of

372
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,681
thy slumbering strain

373
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:33,654
in tears our last

374
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:38,396
farewell was taken

375
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:41,636
and now in tears

376
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:45,744
we meet again

377
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,951
yet, even then

378
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:55,294
while peace was singing

379
00:32:55,363 --> 00:32:58,333
her halcyon song

380
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:03,610
o'er land and sea

381
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:06,715
though joy and hope

382
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:11,992
to others bring ye

383
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,997
she only brought

384
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,936
new tears

385
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:21,843
to thee

386
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:32,696
Yes, Jeb, you'll find
changes, and good ones too.

387
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:36,938
We got four new sections of the
richest fillery you ever saw.

388
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:39,019
I guess any kind of
cattle talk's boresome

389
00:33:39,044 --> 00:33:41,103
after you've been away
from it for a while.

390
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:43,249
Like a fellow
said to me today:

391
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:46,155
"They don't play
brass bands for cattlemen."

392
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:52,132
Speaking of cattle, Jeb, you're
entitled to read this tally.

393
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,842
You'll find all the operations in
here written down, clear and legal.

394
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,079
I don't have to read, Ad.
I can trust your tally.

395
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,149
Well, it's there
for you to see.

396
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:03,688
I've got your share
all marked off.

397
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,058
I call it the Rand share.

398
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:12,370
Sit down, Ad. Won't you
have some more coffee?

399
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:14,808
No, thanks.

400
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:18,715
Well, it's been a big day. One
day's the same as another to me.

401
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:20,719
I gotta be
in the saddle at sunup.

402
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:23,725
Good night, ma.
Good night, son.

403
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,362
Good night.
Good night, Adam.

404
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:36,014
I'll finish up. You go along. No, you-

405
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:39,687
Well, all right.
I'm all tuckered out.

406
00:34:43,562 --> 00:34:45,966
Good night, Jeb.
Good night, ma.

407
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:50,975
All these trips to town
tire me out.

408
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,978
<i>Jeb?</i>

409
00:34:55,216 --> 00:34:57,152
You know somethin'?

410
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:01,060
What?
There's a moon out.

411
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,835
Wait till I get my shawl.

412
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:23,786
Jeb?

413
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:26,523
Jeb, sweetheart,
is something wrong?

414
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,728
Thor, we ought to go away.

415
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,532
We will.
I mean right now, tonight.

416
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,536
Let's hitch up a horse
and not tell anyone.

417
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,964
We'll wake up a preacher over
in town and make him marry us.

418
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,945
You know I'll marry you.

419
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,149
What are we waiting for?

420
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:42,788
I want you to come court me.

421
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:46,394
I know that seems silly when
we grew up together, but...

422
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,631
I want to pretend we didn't.

423
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:51,203
That's why you've got
to come sparkin' me.

424
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,943
Do you mind? You can get
dressed up real fashionable.

425
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:58,817
So will I. I'll have two
chairs out in the gallery.

426
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:00,987
I'll bring out some lemonade.

427
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:03,158
We'll sit there and talk.

428
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:07,633
You can ask me if I'll let
you smoke, and I'll say yes.

429
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,971
I'll have a piece of sewing.

430
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,974
What'll we talk about?

431
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:14,980
Oh, sort of parlor talk.

432
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:19,087
The words will be like stitches that
sew and pull on our lives together.

433
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,860
After a while,
you can hold my hand.

434
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:30,508
You're not supposed to kiss
me till you bought a ring.

435
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:34,282
Oh, Jeb, can you understand?

436
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,388
Can you see it in my way?

437
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,525
Thor, I've never
belonged here.

438
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:44,067
I don't know why. I always have
a feeling something's after me.

439
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,405
It's a bad feeling
I can't explain.

440
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:49,777
Lots of times I'm happy,
but it's still there.

441
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:51,781
Thor, I've gotta be with you.

442
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:54,152
We've got to have a chance. Let's
get away before something happens.

443
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,156
Please, sweetheart.

444
00:36:56,224 --> 00:36:58,327
We're gonna get married, Jeb.

445
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:00,955
We're not gonna spend the rest
of our lives doing crazy things...

446
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,869
Because you think
something's gonna happen.

447
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:07,911
We're not gonna run away at night
like a couple of stagecoach robbers.

448
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:09,915
I love you, Jeb.

449
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:13,521
But if we're gonna get married,
can't it be the way I say?

450
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,062
Please, sweetheart?

451
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,673
I only hope
it turns out that way.

452
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:33,426
After that, I had to be alone
and think things out.

453
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:36,666
We hadn't really quarreled,
and yet somehow we had.

454
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:40,372
It seemed as if we couldn't
understand each other anymore.

455
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,743
One day, I rode up
into butte country.

456
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,515
Came straight to this place,
just as if I'd known the way.

457
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:15,654
There was something in my life
as ruined as that house.

458
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:18,792
That house was myself.

459
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,863
I'd seen it
a million times before-

460
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,702
The fireplace,

461
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,705
The trap door.

462
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:40,600
Out back,
there was some cattle bones.

463
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:52,322
And then as I walked around the
side, I came on some unmarked graves.

464
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,628
All of the sudden,
I couldn't breathe.

465
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:02,072
If that house was me, what part
of me was buried in those graves?

466
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,367
Some folks has me beat.
When there's work to be done,

467
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:05,873
That's the time they decide to go
ridin' all over the countryside.

468
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:09,113
Honey, I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.

469
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,284
I'm sorry.
I just took a little ride.

470
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,288
How long since
you've had something to eat?

471
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:16,393
I don't know, but I'm not
hungry. I'll fix you some coffee.

472
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:19,064
That'll be fine.
Right now I wanna see ma.

473
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:31,355
You got no more sense
than a duck.

474
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:33,392
Well, I had sense enough
to come home.

475
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,330
Why, Thor was fit to be
tied worrying over you.

476
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:38,434
I was sort of worried myself.

477
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:42,575
I got halfway lost. I strayed
away up in that rimrock country,

478
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:44,579
Up Bear Paw Butte way.

479
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,521
Bear Paw Butte? Now, what
crazy thing made you do that?

480
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:52,294
You and Thor have a nip up?

481
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:54,698
Thor had nothing to do
with my going.

482
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:59,774
I wanna ask you
something, ma.

483
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,801
I've been wondering about
that old ranch up there.

484
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:04,916
A goat couldn't live
in that range.

485
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:06,920
A burro would starve.

486
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:09,992
People lived there once
though.

487
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,464
You know the ranch I mean?

488
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,602
I just remembered.
Seems to me there was...

489
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,208
Someplace up there long ago.

490
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,277
Seems to me
I've been there before.

491
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,584
Ma Callum, does that ranch
have to do with me?

492
00:41:23,652 --> 00:41:26,121
Don't ask me questions, Jeb.

493
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:28,493
Did I come from there
as a boy?

494
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:30,797
Is that where you took me
from all those years ago?

495
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,801
Is that why I remember it?

496
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,943
I told you not to look
backward. Look ahead.

497
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:41,617
I obeyed you.
I've lived like you said.

498
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:44,423
All my life, I've known
I didn't really belong here.

499
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:48,830
I couldn't love. I couldn't
return your kindness.

500
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:51,369
Is there something
the matter with me?

501
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:53,406
I wanna understand, ma.
You've gotta tell me.

502
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:56,912
There's nothing the matter
with you, Jeb.

503
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:59,417
That ranch might mean
more to me than it does to you.

504
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:02,088
Anyway, I get upset
talking about it.

505
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:04,460
A person's gotta find
his own answers.

506
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:07,999
We're alone, each of us,
and each in a different way.

507
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:11,706
I won't be alone.
I'm gonna marry Thor.

508
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:13,710
I want you to.

509
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:17,283
But when you do, you've
got the future to live for.

510
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:20,622
I've got the past
to live with too.

511
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,728
My children will have to live
with it. Stop vexing me, Jeb Rand.

512
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:26,366
I'm giving you my daughter
for your wife.

513
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:30,407
Isn't that enough for you? Doesn't
that show you that you're loved?

514
00:42:30,476 --> 00:42:32,512
Go away from me with
your doubts and your-

515
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,817
your Bear Paw Butte
and your crazy long rides.

516
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:38,490
Leave off vexing me.

517
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,526
You told me once
not to question you,

518
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:43,899
But the questions
keep coming back.

519
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,905
If you won't answer me, I'll have to
look somewhere else for the answer.

520
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:05,338
<i>Goin' out, Jeb?</i>

521
00:43:05,406 --> 00:43:08,446
Thought I'd go and see if Mr. Dingle's
faro game is still as crooked as ever.

522
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:11,049
<i>Good idea.
What'd you say?</i>

523
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:13,955
I said it was a good idea.

524
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:15,814
How'd you like to take
two or three thousand

525
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,350
dollars along, stake
you in the game?

526
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,639
Maybe one of us is crazy,
but I don't seem to follow you.

527
00:43:23,707 --> 00:43:24,829
The tally book would've
made it kind of

528
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:27,003
simple if you'd taken
the trouble to read it.

529
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:29,550
That's why I gave it to you
when you came home.

530
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:32,421
Only now, I got
this year's crop added.

531
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:34,726
Two or three thousand would be no
more than your share of the profits.

532
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:37,832
A third to each of us,

533
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,836
The way ma wants it.

534
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:43,910
That's mighty generous. More than
I deserve, least ways expected.

535
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:47,282
Thanks. Here's something
else you don't know.

536
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:54,129
All the time you were in the army,
we've been banking money for you.

537
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,840
Fifteen hundred dollars. There's
just one thing wrong with it, Jeb.

538
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,544
That money came out of the
ranch, and you didn't earn it.

539
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,548
I've been workin'
my share and yours too.

540
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:06,919
I don't aim to
keep on doin' that.

541
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:09,724
<i>I never asked you to. No, but
you never tried to help me either.</i>

542
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,495
Your foot's been well for a month,
and you've been drawin' that money...

543
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:15,401
For lyin' in the shade.

544
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,781
I was lucky if I didn't
have six of my riders

545
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:19,967
stretched out alongside
you playin' pitch.

546
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:22,347
Oh, sure, I know
you were a hero once,

547
00:44:22,415 --> 00:44:26,722
But I've had my belly
full of that too.

548
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,193
We don't pay off
in medals around here.

549
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:33,134
It was too bad
I came home at all.

550
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:35,471
If I hadn't, you would've had
the ranch and the tally money...

551
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,474
And my share of everything
all to yourself.

552
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,901
This "share and share
alike" doesn't sit

553
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:42,342
any better with me
than it does with you.

554
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:45,891
I'm thinkin'
the same way you are.

555
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,919
This ranch isn't big enough
to hold the two of us.

556
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,103
There's a way
we can settle that.

557
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,492
Jeb, you promised me
there'd be no trouble.

558
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,729
I wanna hear
what he has to say.

559
00:44:57,797 --> 00:45:00,534
How can we settle it?
I'll buy you out.

560
00:45:00,602 --> 00:45:04,141
Suppose I don't wanna sell?
Then you buy me out.

561
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:07,481
Now, you know I can't
do that. Adam, please.

562
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:11,687
Jeb, don't say anything more.
Won't you do that much for me?

563
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,059
Thor, you keep out of this.

564
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:17,298
Well, what's your notion,
if you don't like mine?

565
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:20,371
When I went to war,
we settled with a toss.

566
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:22,374
I kept this.

567
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:24,378
Maybe if it suits you,
we can spin it again.

568
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:27,984
There might be some luck
in it for me this time.

569
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:31,892
I'll toss you. My share against
yours. One of us stays, and one goes.

570
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,464
Oh, you can't!
You either!

571
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,569
It's wrong and crazy.

572
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:41,777
Ever since we were little, we've all
been here together - the three of us.

573
00:45:41,844 --> 00:45:44,950
This is no way to change it
if it's going to be changed.

574
00:45:45,017 --> 00:45:47,019
One toss.

575
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:49,324
You wanna spin it?
Adam, I beg you!

576
00:45:49,392 --> 00:45:51,328
And you, Jeb, don't do it!

577
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:54,701
Winner take all.
One toss.

578
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:56,705
Call it.
Heads.

579
00:46:02,015 --> 00:46:04,219
I might've known
that cartwheel was bad luck.

580
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:08,126
Well, I'll be ridin' in town.

581
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:10,330
I'll hire a rig tomorrow
and come back for my things.

582
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:15,071
No, you won't.
You ain't got no things,

583
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,209
Exceptin'
what you're wearin'...

584
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,913
And this!

585
00:47:35,738 --> 00:47:37,908
Tomorrow I'm coming back,

586
00:47:37,975 --> 00:47:40,112
And you're coming with me.

587
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,116
If he tries to stop me,
I'll kill him.

588
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,976
Ma'll never let you do this.
Maybe she'll have to.

589
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,481
Then I'll go with him
in the morning.

590
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:39,086
When he comes, I'll be ready.
You'd never.

591
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:41,458
Not if it meant
leavin' the ranch.

592
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:45,198
The ranch isn't everything
to me. It isn't a husband.

593
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:48,705
"The ranch be a husband."
you're talkin' crazy.

594
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:50,774
It's been a wife
to you, Adam,

595
00:48:50,843 --> 00:48:52,778
Because you don't have
a wife.

596
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:57,053
You just have the ranch.
Well, I don't belong to it.

597
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,960
You can take me off that dogeared
tally book you carry around.

598
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,266
You hate me then?

599
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:06,270
I love you.

600
00:49:06,338 --> 00:49:09,710
I always thought the three
of us would never be apart.

601
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:12,448
Three. Three!
You're always sayin' that!

602
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,452
But why does he count?
It's you and me.

603
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,327
Now you're the one that's talkin'
crazy. I want a home of my own.

604
00:49:19,396 --> 00:49:22,868
Grant Callum knew him.
Knew his people too.

605
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:25,539
Told me to look up the records
in Glorietta county.

606
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:28,578
And did you? Sure I did,
and I found something.

607
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:31,216
A family named Rand
did live there once.

608
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:33,421
I found out
enough for me-

609
00:49:33,488 --> 00:49:35,858
A reason why I'll
never let you marry him.

610
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:38,696
I don't care
what your reason is.

611
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:41,367
You're talkin' like
a back-fence gossip.

612
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,140
Do you think that kind of
talk means anything to me?

613
00:49:44,207 --> 00:49:46,545
Nothing in the world
can change the way I feel.

614
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,550
I always knew
you cared for him.

615
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:55,060
I guess...
I never knew how much.

616
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:58,066
Looks as if we're gonna have
to set things right.

617
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,102
You'll-
you'll go after him, then?

618
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,106
You'll ride in town
and bring him back?

619
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,148
I'll do it.
I'll ride in town tonight.

620
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:22,979
Mr. Dingle, can you take
this man's I.O.U.?

621
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:26,017
Yes, I'll take it.

622
00:50:27,855 --> 00:50:29,992
Now throw him out.
Yes.

623
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:39,576
Keep your hands off me,
will ya?

624
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,869
What's the matter, Jake? Don't
you take money in here anymore?

625
00:50:53,937 --> 00:50:56,040
Any money you put on
this bar is counterfeit.

626
00:50:56,107 --> 00:50:58,243
I'm saving you for the wheel.

627
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:02,084
Did you run into a fellow who
nearly convinced you? Well, he tried.

628
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:05,323
You know, I flipped this dollar
twice with Adam. I lost both times.

629
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:07,962
Last time, I went to war.
This time, I left the ranch.

630
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:11,267
You left the ranch?
You mean that?

631
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:14,172
Maybe you've played
into a cold deck.

632
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,310
Well, I guess it's all
for the best. Oh, sure.

633
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:19,850
A man's luck's bound to change
sometime. You appear lucky to me.

634
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:24,124
Don't you want some action for this
dollar? It's kind of a keepsake.

635
00:51:24,192 --> 00:51:27,030
Oh. Well, many a man's been
down to his last dollar...

636
00:51:27,098 --> 00:51:29,434
Before the change does come.

637
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:33,041
I guess you just
want this dollar.

638
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:36,948
All right,
go ahead and take it.

639
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,291
Hey, Jeb, you won.

640
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,263
Let it ride. Oh, no. Too
many angles at this game.

641
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:56,267
I'd rather play poker.

642
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,161
You've had a run of good luck,
Jeb. Why don't you pull out?

643
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,165
Oh, once more.
Oh, brother.

644
00:52:13,232 --> 00:52:16,438
Luck's sure riding on your shoulder.
Probably clean this place out.

645
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:18,441
Oh, I've got a feeling
you're through.

646
00:52:18,509 --> 00:52:22,715
Well, I've got about $1,500 here
that says you've got a wrong feeling.

647
00:52:22,783 --> 00:52:24,786
Joe, get me a new deck.

648
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:45,590
Well...

649
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:46,962
There it is.

650
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,937
I'll tell you what I'd
do with that money

651
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:50,958
if I were you. Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

652
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,839
I'd buy into this business.
I'll sell you a piece of it.

653
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:56,478
You don't mean that?
Yes, I do.

654
00:52:56,546 --> 00:52:58,615
You know why?
Why?

655
00:52:58,683 --> 00:53:01,287
Well, because
people trust you...

656
00:53:01,355 --> 00:53:04,459
And, well,
I'm just honest Jake dingle.

657
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:08,133
You know, I might
take you up on that.

658
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:10,136
I'll be looking for
a business by and by.

659
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:12,071
Well, you think it over
and let me know. We'd

660
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:13,800
make a great combination,
you and myself.

661
00:53:13,843 --> 00:53:17,817
And if you do come in, I'll
teach you how to handle cards.

662
00:53:17,885 --> 00:53:19,854
It don't hurt anything.

663
00:53:19,922 --> 00:53:22,426
Good night.
Good night, partner.

664
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:24,797
And take good care
of that money.

665
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:52,714
As I walked out
on the streets

666
00:53:52,782 --> 00:53:54,785
of Laredo

667
00:53:54,853 --> 00:54:00,163
I walked out on
Laredo one day

668
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,900
I spied a cow puncher

669
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:06,106
wrapped up in white linen

670
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:11,115
wrapped in white linen
as cold as the clay

671
00:54:11,184 --> 00:54:17,093
beat the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly

672
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:22,470
play the dead march
as you carry me along

673
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:28,315
take me out to the prairie
and lay the sod over me

674
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:33,790
for I'm a poor cowboy
and I know I've done wrong

675
00:54:45,897 --> 00:54:48,769
and lay the sod over me

676
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,394
<i>Adam.</i>

677
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:45,779
Now, let us continue.

678
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:48,416
I disagree with the learned
corner. I still maintain...

679
00:57:48,484 --> 00:57:51,590
We're a legal body,
properly impaneled.

680
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:54,862
Sit down, Grant.
This is my hearin'.

681
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,136
I don't need no county prosecutor
to tell me how to run it.

682
00:57:59,204 --> 00:58:01,373
Furthermore,
since it so happens...

683
00:58:01,441 --> 00:58:04,313
Said prosecutor's name
is Callum,

684
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,020
I wouldn't want to say he's prejudiced
'cause I'm clean-minded, I am.

685
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:10,758
It's my duty to see
the law administered...

686
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:13,262
Regardless of family
or anything else.

687
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:18,606
Gentlemen, I swear from
the bottom of my heart...

688
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:21,511
<i>I never felt more like
quitting my job than right now.</i>

689
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:24,817
Because I well know what
this case may cost a family-

690
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:27,539
A sorrowing mother
and sister-

691
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:30,311
<i>Who have already lost
one son, one brother...</i>

692
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:35,387
And, if my guess is right,
may lose another to the law.

693
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,934
Miss Callum,

694
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:45,004
On the night in question,

695
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:48,010
Did you witness a quarrel
between your brother and Jeb Rand?

696
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:52,251
Yes, I did.

697
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,958
And did you hear the accused utter
any threat with regard to Adam?

698
00:58:58,213 --> 00:59:00,149
Yes.

699
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:02,287
<i>You may repeat
what you heard.</i>

700
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,064
Jeb said he was comin' back
next day to get me...

701
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:12,472
To take me with him
and marry me.

702
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:25,647
He said if Adam tried to
stop him, he'd kill him.

703
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:36,567
Perhaps you fellers
might like a spot of tea.

704
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:40,073
Now, here's the size of it.

705
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:43,045
Here's two men that had
no use want for each other.

706
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:46,785
All that's been testified, but that
ain't what we're here to decide.

707
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:49,758
It looks like Jeb
shot him down like Grant said.

708
00:59:49,825 --> 00:59:54,433
Hold your horses. It's Grant's
word against Jeb's, he way I see it.

709
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,556
Jeb never was no murderer. I figure
there's plenty of doubt on both sides.

710
00:59:58,624 --> 01:00:01,162
The heck you say. Nobody
can get along with Ad Callum.

711
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,167
Let's get somethin' done. I gotta
get home and look after my stall.

712
01:00:06,372 --> 01:00:08,542
Shut up!

713
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:12,282
You fellows saw the general
pin a medal on Jeb.

714
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,222
Ah, he weren't decoratin'
no ambusher...

715
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:18,227
But a man that fought
fair and square for his country.

716
01:00:18,294 --> 01:00:21,499
It don't stand to reason that a man that
shot down a dozen fellows in battle...

717
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:24,404
Would shoot down his own brother
without givin' him a chance.

718
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:26,909
If he had to drill him,
he'd do it right.

719
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:30,182
Uh-uh-uh! And if he done it
right, then it ain't no killin',

720
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,186
But a lawful fight.

721
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,690
And hereabouts we ain't
so danged uncivilized...

722
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:37,863
A man can't win a lawful fight without
gettin' his neck in a noose for it.

723
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:41,068
Pass the tea.

724
01:00:53,226 --> 01:00:55,296
Thank you.

725
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,980
May I speak to you
before you go, Mrs. Callum?

726
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,922
I know you don't hold with the
verdict of the jury, but it was fair.

727
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,160
I never murdered Adam.

728
01:01:13,596 --> 01:01:16,434
You'll be shorthanded
at the ranch.

729
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:20,442
If you'll permit me, I'd be happy
to come back and help you out.

730
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:23,113
I make this offer
most sincerely.

731
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:25,384
Get away from me, Jeb Rand.

732
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,089
I know how you
must feel about me,

733
01:01:28,156 --> 01:01:31,428
But I was hoping that
in time I could change that.

734
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:35,002
It's too late
to change anything.

735
01:01:35,069 --> 01:01:38,241
Mother, let's go.

736
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:40,812
No. I'll
have my say.

737
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,050
You may have cleared
yourself in there,

738
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:45,121
But not with me.

739
01:01:45,188 --> 01:01:47,992
With me you're walkin'
up the gallows steps.

740
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,000
I built that gallows.
I tied the noose.

741
01:01:52,068 --> 01:01:54,338
All the love I had
for you is dead.

742
01:01:57,144 --> 01:01:59,380
Stay out of my sight.

743
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:03,521
If you cross my section line,
I'll set the dogs on you.

744
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:06,593
Is that the way you feel?

745
01:02:22,123 --> 01:02:25,061
You'd made pretty clear
how you felt,

746
01:02:25,129 --> 01:02:27,865
So that fall
I put in with Jake.

747
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,962
I found out how dull
gambling could be when

748
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:31,830
I stood on the other
side of the table.

749
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,579
Once or twice we got some news
about you. Come on, baby!

750
01:02:34,646 --> 01:02:36,582
How you'd been sick,

751
01:02:36,649 --> 01:02:39,687
How you were living out at
the ranch and not seeing anyone.

752
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:42,927
I watched for you to come
into town, but you never did.

753
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:46,767
It was fall again before I heard
young Prentice, the storekeeper's son,

754
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:49,773
Was taking you and your mother
to the dance.

755
01:02:57,388 --> 01:03:01,629
Do-Si your daughters
and do-Si your old men

756
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:06,002
do-Si your brothers to the
ball and do-Si back home

757
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:11,946
Allemande left
and the old left hand

758
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:19,595
meet your partner
and promenade

759
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:21,933
it's on fire and I don't care

760
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,004
and park your gal
in an easy chair

761
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:29,546
Would you like a glass
of punch? I'd love it.

762
01:03:29,614 --> 01:03:31,617
Excuse me a minute.
Thanks.

763
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:47,780
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the next will be la Varsouviana.

764
01:03:49,317 --> 01:03:51,887
May I have the pleasure?
Please go away.

765
01:03:51,955 --> 01:03:54,091
Better dance, or people
will look at you.

766
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,164
I'd rather have people look at me
than dance with somebody I hate.

767
01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:44,885
What a coward you are.

768
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,327
A coward wouldn't have
come here to dance with you.

769
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:09,531
Hold it. All right, folks,
that's enough of our slow dance.

770
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,702
Here's a chance
to swing your ladies,

771
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:15,776
So get your partners
for a chicken reel.

772
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:26,328
Uh... You saw Thor dancin'
with Jeb, didn't you?

773
01:05:26,396 --> 01:05:29,601
Why, yes. Come on, son. Let's
you and I have a little talk.

774
01:05:29,669 --> 01:05:32,874
Now, you forced her. Jeb Rand, the
man she hates most in the world,

775
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:35,262
Forced her to dance with him.
I was getting her some punch.

776
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:37,750
You're escorting her this
evening, aren't you? Yes.

777
01:05:37,818 --> 01:05:41,089
Did you bring her here so she could be
insulted? No. I wouldn't let that happen.

778
01:05:41,157 --> 01:05:44,496
Well, it's happened.
What are you gonna do about it?

779
01:05:44,564 --> 01:05:46,532
Pardon us, gentlemen.

780
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:59,006
Mr. Callum, all this
started long ago.

781
01:05:59,074 --> 01:06:02,779
It isn't my fight. Then you're
not the man I took you for.

782
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:05,183
I'll do what's right.

783
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:09,191
If you let him get away with it,
she'll never speak to you again.

784
01:06:09,259 --> 01:06:13,099
Did she say that? If she
didn't, she's thinking it.

785
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,970
And there's something else
she's thinking of.

786
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:20,211
It's the death
of her brother.

787
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:26,823
Mr. Callum, sir...
I'm not much good with a gun.

788
01:06:26,892 --> 01:06:29,562
Maybe you'll have some help.

789
01:06:30,598 --> 01:06:32,835
Go up to the alley.

790
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:35,840
If he's an honest wheel, you'll
find him in the back room.

791
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,111
Shoot him through the window.

792
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:41,918
No, sir, I-
I can't do that.

793
01:06:41,986 --> 01:06:44,557
But I'll make him
come out to me.

794
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,298
What's the matter, Jake?
Couldn't you find any partner?

795
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:09,569
You found one you
shouldn't have-Thor.

796
01:07:09,637 --> 01:07:12,374
Young Prentice is comin' over
after you for it. Prentice?

797
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:16,215
He's on his way over here now. Get
the drop on him, Jeb. Go on out front.

798
01:07:18,286 --> 01:07:20,890
First Adam, now Prentice.

799
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,294
<i>Man, you gotta get going.</i>

800
01:07:23,362 --> 01:07:26,033
I don't wanna get
the drop on him, Jake.

801
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:28,070
What are you gonna do?

802
01:07:28,138 --> 01:07:30,340
Step out in the alley
and make myself scarce.

803
01:07:43,365 --> 01:07:45,368
<i>Mr. Rand.
What do you want?</i>

804
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,975
I've come because
of what you did to Thorley.

805
01:07:49,043 --> 01:07:52,081
Go on home, Prentice.
I don't want to hurt you.

806
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:55,086
Defend yourself,
Mr. Rand.

807
01:09:16,404 --> 01:09:20,043
I wouldn't try that
if I were you, Grant.

808
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:27,958
Let's get him in the office.

809
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:03,057
I- I did it
for Thorley.

810
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,598
I'm sorry, Prentice.

811
01:10:19,854 --> 01:10:22,926
It was self-defense
just as they said,

812
01:10:22,994 --> 01:10:27,033
Yet he was one more part of
the mystery of people hating me.

813
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:30,073
How I saw the boots
of the pallbearers,

814
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:32,344
The flashes of light.

815
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:40,024
I had that feeling some lost and
awful thing come over me again.

816
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:00,796
I wasn't sure whether killing
Prentice was my fault,

817
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:04,136
Whether it was due to some
badness locked up in me.

818
01:11:04,204 --> 01:11:06,674
But I was sure
of my love for you.

819
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:10,247
That was the only hope
and the only answer.

820
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:13,954
If love could come out of all this,
we might still have some chance.

821
01:11:14,022 --> 01:11:15,958
We might live.

822
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:19,180
Right then I knew
I had to have you.

823
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:23,638
I'd have to climb across
two graves to get to you,

824
01:11:23,706 --> 01:11:26,777
But nothing in the world
could hold me back.

825
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,978
Who's that comin'?

826
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,887
It's Jeb Rand.

827
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:54,262
He's comin' to call on me.

828
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:58,135
Jeb Rand?
Callin' on you?

829
01:11:58,203 --> 01:12:00,506
I knew he'd come.

830
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:02,877
I've been expectin' him.

831
01:12:08,755 --> 01:12:11,593
You've no right to expect him,
much less to see him.

832
01:12:13,631 --> 01:12:16,035
I'm askin' him in.

833
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:35,404
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Won't you come in?

834
01:12:35,472 --> 01:12:37,475
Thank you.

835
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,384
It was kind of you
to receive me.

836
01:12:43,487 --> 01:12:46,024
Please sit down.

837
01:12:46,092 --> 01:12:48,095
Thank you.

838
01:12:53,405 --> 01:12:55,608
Would you like some coffee?

839
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:57,879
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

840
01:12:57,946 --> 01:13:01,419
Oh, it's no trouble.
We were just going to have some.

841
01:13:01,487 --> 01:13:04,858
I'm sorry we have
nothing else to offer.

842
01:13:04,926 --> 01:13:07,563
In this house all we have
is a little wine.

843
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:10,936
That's just for Christmas
and holidays.

844
01:13:11,004 --> 01:13:14,109
Seems to me I remember
something about that wine.

845
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,889
That's a music box
ma had sent from Santa Fe.

846
01:13:21,957 --> 01:13:27,033
I know. It plays
"The Londonderry Air."

847
01:13:54,968 --> 01:13:59,943
It's an old-fashioned tune.
Some people don't care for it.

848
01:14:09,127 --> 01:14:12,900
May I smoke?
Or would that annoy you?

849
01:14:12,968 --> 01:14:14,970
No, of course not.

850
01:14:31,804 --> 01:14:36,578
This is a sampler I'm makin'.
I'm not very good at it.

851
01:14:41,521 --> 01:14:45,794
Here we are courting, the way
you asked me to long ago.

852
01:14:45,862 --> 01:14:48,800
But it's all different.

853
01:14:48,868 --> 01:14:52,507
<i>You sitting there.
Me smoking, you sewing.</i>

854
01:14:54,512 --> 01:14:57,483
Just like
any ordinary people.

855
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:00,421
It's worse than fighting
or yelling in the street.

856
01:15:04,497 --> 01:15:08,102
- Don't you want your coffee?
- No, thanks.

857
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:13,011
Perhaps later. Why don't you sit
down in the comfortable chair?

858
01:15:13,078 --> 01:15:16,283
Company always uses that one.

859
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:44,770
I tried to figure out what crazy
game you were playing with me,

860
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:46,774
And I couldn't.

861
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:50,080
But I knew I'd play it out
with you right till the end.

862
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,665
Am I seeing things?
Well, I declare!

863
01:16:37,118 --> 01:16:40,088
Good night, Jeb
I'll see you tomorrow?

864
01:16:40,156 --> 01:16:42,159
Of course.

865
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:03,933
Thor.

866
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,679
<i>Thor! Come here!</i>

867
01:17:30,282 --> 01:17:32,452
- What is it?
- Come closer.

868
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:49,283
Turn the lamp up.

869
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:56,329
That's right.
I want to look at you.

870
01:17:56,397 --> 01:17:58,333
I haven't changed, mother.

871
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:03,043
What have I taught you that showed
you how to bring dishonor on us?

872
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:06,181
I've brought you no dishonor.

873
01:18:07,752 --> 01:18:11,357
Jeb gave me this tonight.

874
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:13,527
I'm going to marry him,
mother.

875
01:18:13,596 --> 01:18:18,169
What's in this that I don't
understand? Do you love him then?

876
01:18:18,237 --> 01:18:22,712
I have only one thought
every minute of my life:

877
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:24,716
How much I hate him.

878
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,886
But you wear his ring.

879
01:18:30,327 --> 01:18:35,168
If I were a man,
I would've killed him long ago.

880
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:38,373
After Adam's death.

881
01:18:38,442 --> 01:18:42,749
Then he killed Prentice
and came courtin' me.

882
01:18:42,816 --> 01:18:46,188
All of a sudden,
killin' wasn't enough.

883
01:18:46,256 --> 01:18:48,559
I had to have more-

884
01:18:48,627 --> 01:18:51,598
Much more-to use up
all the hate I have in me.

885
01:18:55,006 --> 01:18:58,545
Thor, I'll sell this place.
I'll go away.

886
01:18:58,612 --> 01:19:00,983
I won't stay here
and see this thing happen.

887
01:19:02,853 --> 01:19:05,725
Perhaps that may be best.

888
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:10,633
You go away for a while.
We'll be together again soon.

889
01:19:10,702 --> 01:19:13,138
No woman ever lived...

890
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:16,912
Who could go through
with what you're planning.

891
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:19,818
No woman but me.

892
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:23,991
'cause it's taken all my life
to teach me what he is.

893
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:27,331
He put shame and grief on us,

894
01:19:27,398 --> 01:19:31,672
And now he'd like to squeeze out
the last drop of it by havin' me.

895
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:36,882
He wants me...

896
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:39,386
And I'll marry him.

897
01:19:39,454 --> 01:19:44,395
That moment when he thinks he
has me, he'll lose everything...

898
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:47,902
Because that's when
I'm going to kill him.

899
01:19:50,107 --> 01:19:52,912
For richer, for poorer.

900
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,915
For richer, for poorer.

901
01:19:54,983 --> 01:19:56,919
In sickness and in health.

902
01:19:56,987 --> 01:19:58,923
In sickness and in health.

903
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:01,194
Until death do us part.

904
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:03,330
Until death do us part.

905
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:17,456
What made you do that?

906
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:21,898
I don't know. Such fine young
folks, and nobody at the wedding.

907
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,177
I have a surprise for you.
I've bought you a house.

908
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:30,247
All right, Charlie.

909
01:20:42,086 --> 01:20:45,492
Well, now you've seen it.
That's why I sent for you.

910
01:20:45,559 --> 01:20:48,002
Bein' as we're all Callums
here, I don't have

911
01:20:48,027 --> 01:20:50,257
to tell you what we're
gonna do about it.

912
01:20:50,301 --> 01:20:53,507
Sure enough, you'll get
yourself in trouble, and us too.

913
01:20:53,574 --> 01:20:56,479
Yeah. Times have changed
since all this started, Grant.

914
01:20:56,547 --> 01:20:58,782
You can't ride herd
on the law no more.

915
01:20:58,851 --> 01:21:01,922
You're telling me about the law?
No, sir.

916
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:07,399
You thinkin' like him, that
you're not goin'? That's right.

917
01:21:10,572 --> 01:21:13,544
I think we're all goin'.

918
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,669
When I heard
about the auction,

919
01:21:45,737 --> 01:21:49,677
I figured it'd be better for me to buy
it than see it pass on to strangers.

920
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:52,649
Allow me. I know it's a
custom to carry the bride in,

921
01:21:52,717 --> 01:21:55,386
But perhaps
we can let that go.

922
01:21:55,455 --> 01:21:59,095
I always figured when I got
married I'd have all the trimmings.

923
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:27,741
You may notice some changes.
There are some

924
01:22:27,766 --> 01:22:30,309
fixings I brought here
from Kansas City.

925
01:22:30,352 --> 01:22:33,190
Mighty pretty place
you've got here.

926
01:22:33,258 --> 01:22:36,462
Charlie, would you take Mrs. Rand's
bags into the front bedroom, please?

927
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,533
I sure will.

928
01:24:23,795 --> 01:24:25,798
Come in.

929
01:24:33,915 --> 01:24:36,418
You're very beautiful.

930
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:39,223
<i>Thank you.</i>

931
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:41,560
I hope you'll
be comfortable here.

932
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:45,802
In this house it takes very
little to make me comfortable.

933
01:24:47,205 --> 01:24:50,110
I brought you some wine.

934
01:24:52,248 --> 01:24:55,786
It's customary, I believe,
to drink to a bride's health.

935
01:24:55,854 --> 01:24:58,625
You're very gallant.

936
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:42,407
So you know.

937
01:25:42,474 --> 01:25:45,412
You and I are much alike.

938
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:48,851
There are times when
I can read your thoughts...

939
01:25:48,919 --> 01:25:52,391
By asking myself what I'd do
if I were in your place.

940
01:25:52,459 --> 01:25:55,830
I know that's an irritating
quality in a husband,

941
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:57,868
But it may help
to make things easier for you.

942
01:26:00,107 --> 01:26:02,444
Don't come any closer.

943
01:26:02,511 --> 01:26:05,182
You sure this is all right?

944
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,886
Prentice missed
because the light was bad.

945
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,124
Adam was too anxious.

946
01:26:10,192 --> 01:26:12,862
I'm glad you don't suffer
from those handicaps.

947
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:15,367
No, I don't.

948
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:23,749
Do you know
why you missed me?

949
01:26:23,817 --> 01:26:26,254
Because I hate you so,
my hand shook.

950
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:32,733
Your hand shook,
but not because you hate me.

951
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,869
Put the gun down, Thor.

952
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:50,732
Oh, Jeb. Hold me.

953
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,803
Hold me.

954
01:28:17,427 --> 01:28:20,532
<i>Jeb? What is it?
What's the matter?</i>

955
01:28:20,599 --> 01:28:24,672
I've gotta leave. There are men
outside. They want to kill me.

956
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,176
It's all
Grant Callum's doing.

957
01:28:27,245 --> 01:28:30,383
I don't know why, but he's wanted
me dead ever since I can remember.

958
01:28:30,451 --> 01:28:34,290
Oh, take me with you. I can't, but
we can be together in a little while.

959
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:37,262
There's an old ruined ranch up
by Bear Paw Butte. Meet me there.

960
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:41,504
How do I find it? Take the trail through
Rimrock Canyon, across the county line.

961
01:28:41,572 --> 01:28:43,574
Oh, I'll be there.

962
01:34:03,783 --> 01:34:07,155
Looks like he jumped clean off this
bluff here. Aw, he just outrun us.

963
01:34:07,222 --> 01:34:11,295
Let's give it up. I got a
hunch I know where he is.

964
01:34:11,363 --> 01:34:15,603
Russ, go fetch ma Callum
and bring her to Bear Paw Butte.

965
01:34:23,485 --> 01:34:27,525
It's all going to happen again,
but I don't care now.

966
01:34:27,593 --> 01:34:30,330
I know there's one big answer
I've always looked for:

967
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:33,937
Why I was alone;
why everything went wrong;

968
01:34:34,005 --> 01:34:36,943
Why I had hate in me
instead of love.

969
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:40,482
There was a black dog
riding my back and yours too.

970
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,823
I guess we've lost our chance, but
there's nothing we can do about it now.

971
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:48,331
Oh, but there is. We've got to
get away from here, both of us.

972
01:35:19,389 --> 01:35:23,111
Jeb Rand, we know you're
in there. Come on out!

973
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:36,636
We'll give you two minutes!

974
01:35:42,214 --> 01:35:44,384
Are you hurt?

975
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:53,067
I remember now. Those dreams I've
been having ever since I was a kid.

976
01:35:53,134 --> 01:35:55,270
The flashes were gunfire,

977
01:35:55,338 --> 01:35:58,477
And the man shooting
was my father.

978
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:02,183
My sister lay on the floor dead,
and my brothers were dead too.

979
01:36:02,251 --> 01:36:06,291
The boots and spurs,
they were my father's.

980
01:36:13,572 --> 01:36:15,608
Then he was hit.

981
01:36:15,677 --> 01:36:18,881
I saw him fall.
I knew he'd been killed.

982
01:36:20,953 --> 01:36:24,324
I was too scared to yell,
so I just stayed there.

983
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:27,631
Then a man came in-
Grant Callum.

984
01:36:29,035 --> 01:36:32,840
He was dragging a woman
with him. She was your mother.

985
01:36:34,545 --> 01:36:37,149
He told her
to look at her Rand now.

986
01:36:37,216 --> 01:36:40,855
I remember those words-
"your Rand."

987
01:36:40,923 --> 01:36:45,164
He asked her if the love she had
for him was worth what she'd done.

988
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:48,870
Then he threw her down
and dragged my father out.

989
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:55,048
Jeb, darling, how horrible.

990
01:36:56,284 --> 01:36:58,755
It must mean
that my mother-

991
01:36:58,823 --> 01:37:01,259
One minute! Come out,
or we'll come and drag you out!

992
01:37:01,327 --> 01:37:03,263
Come on.
I won't.

993
01:37:03,331 --> 01:37:06,268
You're doing this for me because
you're afraid I'll be hurt.

994
01:37:06,336 --> 01:37:08,706
I don't want to live without
you. We've gotta fight.

995
01:37:08,775 --> 01:37:12,145
We're comin' out.
Don't shoot.

996
01:37:12,213 --> 01:37:14,517
Throw your gun out!

997
01:37:19,461 --> 01:37:21,964
Put your hands up.

998
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:47,311
Oh! Oh, I told him to fight you,
to die fightin' if he had to!

999
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,924
Let me go!

1000
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,482
Oh, mother, you won't
let them do this!

1001
01:37:58,550 --> 01:38:01,019
So, Grant, you're gonna
have it your way at last.

1002
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,291
I told you I'd wait
until he was grown.

1003
01:38:03,358 --> 01:38:06,930
Well, now he's growed and he gets
his legacy. Only it's made out of him.

1004
01:38:06,998 --> 01:38:10,537
He earned it just as his
father earned the lead he got...

1005
01:38:10,605 --> 01:38:13,041
When he stole
my brother's wife.

1006
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:15,981
Then it was Jeb's father!
You loved him.

1007
01:38:16,048 --> 01:38:20,155
Yes, only she forgot she
was married to a Callum.

1008
01:38:20,223 --> 01:38:22,843
Bring a horse here.
Get me a rope.

1009
01:38:29,273 --> 01:38:31,709
Jeb told me about the feud.

1010
01:38:31,777 --> 01:38:34,014
Now I understand
the part I didn't know.

1011
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:37,052
It all started because
of your love, your guilt.

1012
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,423
That's why you'd like
to see Jeb hanged.

1013
01:38:39,491 --> 01:38:42,963
You don't know what you're
sayin'. This is none of my askin'.

1014
01:38:43,031 --> 01:38:45,598
You never gave Jeb a chance.
You never told

1015
01:38:45,623 --> 01:38:48,130
him the truth so he
could protect himself.

1016
01:38:48,175 --> 01:38:51,613
- I was trying to protect you.
- That's a lie.

1017
01:38:51,681 --> 01:38:56,087
- You were ashamed.
- I've paid for what I did.

1018
01:38:56,156 --> 01:38:58,459
I gave the boy a home.
I took him in.

1019
01:38:58,527 --> 01:39:03,835
That paid for all the killin's? For the
way my father died, and Jeb's father?

1020
01:39:03,903 --> 01:39:07,242
Well, it didn't!
You loved his father.

1021
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:10,046
<i>Or are you ashamed now
to remember how you loved?</i>

1022
01:39:10,114 --> 01:39:12,351
No. I loved his father.

1023
01:39:12,419 --> 01:39:16,492
You failed him, mother,
and you failed yourself.

1024
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,199
You lost the man you loved.
He died here.

1025
01:39:20,267 --> 01:39:23,739
But my man won't,
unless they kill me too!

1026
01:39:25,644 --> 01:39:27,646
You can't!

1027
01:39:58,003 --> 01:40:02,744
I'm sorry, Jeb, for all
the wrong I did ya.

1028
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:06,251
Forgive me. You didn't
have to ask me that.

1029
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:09,590
You've given me back my life.
Oh, mother.

1030
01:40:09,658 --> 01:40:13,564
I told you once, Jeb,
never to look back.

1031
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:16,971
Look ahead.
I tell you that again now.

1032
01:40:17,038 --> 01:40:21,812
You couldn't then.
But now I can and will.

1033
01:40:22,815 --> 01:40:25,820
Take your wife home, Jeb.
