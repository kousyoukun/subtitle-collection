1
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,964
Jeb?

2
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:45,908
Jeb, where are you?

3
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,917
Oh!

4
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,676
Are you all right?
I'm all right.

5
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:03,412
I brought you some things
- some meal and beans and a good canteen.

6
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:06,036
Is that what kept you-
getting those things?

7
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,987
I came as soon as I could.

8
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:11,060
I brought you a map too.
Look.

9
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:14,867
If you work up north through the
gloriettas, you can hit the skin road.

10
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:18,355
<i>If I work north? What about you? Yes, jeb.</i>

11
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,515
Where will you be?
I'm not going with you.

12
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,883
I knew it as soon
as you came in...

13
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:28,531
By the look on your face
and the way you walked.

14
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:30,579
You've always been like that-

15
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:34,674
Able to think with my thoughts
and feel with my feelings.

16
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,331
But there's something
that keeps us apart.

17
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,434
Oh, jeb, what happened to us?
Why did everything go wrong?

18
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,170
I don't know all of it,
but I know some.

19
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:48,498
I've been thinking
and figuring.

20
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:50,961
This is where it started, this
is where it's going to end.

21
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:54,274
You see that rise?
He'll be coming over that.

22
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:56,354
He'll come killing.

23
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,905
Come out,
or we'll come in after ya!

24
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,041
You hear it?

25
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:12,384
Jeb, honey,
there's no one out there.

26
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,521
You're imagining.
I'm not imagining.

27
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:18,080
Remembering.

28
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:21,664
Putting together what happened-
what I guess must've happened.

29
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,320
Thor, it's all coming
back, strong and clear.

30
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:27,041
There's an answer in it.

31
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:29,855
There's something about me
that explains everything.

32
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:33,056
Jeb, I don't understand. I'm
gonna make you understand.

33
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:37,408
I've got to
before they get here.

34
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:40,063
Do you know why
I came to this place?

35
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:43,519
No, jeb, but...
It's not a good hideout.

36
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,983
They're sure
to trail you here.

37
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
I came for another reason.

38
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:52,383
I was here before,
long ago.

39
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,103
I was a baby then.

40
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,759
I was scared the way
only a kid can get.

41
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,238
I was in a dark,
cold place.

42
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,870
I had my eyes closed to get
away from some bad dream-

43
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,782
The same dream
I'd been having all my life.

44
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:14,894
I've never understood it. There
were boots running, flashes.

45
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,814
Daddy? Daddy?

46
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,629
but my father wasn't there.

47
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:22,349
Instead, a strange woman
was lying on the floor.

48
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,398
She crawled toward me.

49
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,669
That was the first time
I saw your mother.

50
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,890
Get up, son. No, jeb,
you can't go to sleep now.

51
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,801
Get your clothes on, son. We're
going away from here. Who is that?

52
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:54,057
That's jeb rand. Now, pay
attention, adam... And thor.

53
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,906
This is jeb.
He's going to live with us.

54
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:59,082
Come on, now.
Help your sister.

55
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:04,390
They've gone,
every danged one of 'em.

56
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,342
They've moved away
somewhere.

57
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,294
Grant, if you ride with
that arm, you'll lose it.

58
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:12,454
I'll find 'em if it takes me
to the end of my life.

59
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,910
The idea that I was hiding or
running away never quite died out.

60
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:20,102
It should have, I guess, because
the next seven years I wasn't hiding.

61
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,278
Your ma was
taking care of all of us.

62
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,293
I was growing up
with you and adam,

63
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:28,613
Going to school, helping to build a
house in the new place we moved to,

64
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:31,493
Having the whole outdoors
for a playground.

65
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:35,829
I'd about stopped having nightmares until
one day when I was about nine or ten-

66
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:11,236
Look, jeb!
A little black chick.

67
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,796
I found him under the house.

68
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:20,420
- What's the matter with you?
- You know what's the matter! You shot the colt!

69
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:22,723
Shot what colt?
Are you crazy?

70
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:27,364
Mom!

71
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,628
<i>Jeb, stop!</i>

72
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,547
Stop!

73
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,379
Mom! Mom, they're fighting again! Mom!

74
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,875
Now, stop that fighting, boys!
Stop that fighting!

75
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,370
Now, stop it!
Stop that fighting, boys!

76
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,290
Thor, pump some water.

77
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:06,050
Now, stop it! Come on, boys!
Now, stop that fighting!

78
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:08,098
Come on!
Stop it!

79
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:10,017
Adam! Jeb!

80
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,241
Now, what's it all about?

81
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:16,418
He shot the colt.
I didn't!

82
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,338
You did so! You mean
somebody shot our colt?

83
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:21,441
Said it was his.
He said I couldn't ride it.

84
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:24,098
But I rode it anyway.
He took a shot at it.

85
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:27,393
Or maybe me.
I don't know.

86
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,497
But anyway,
he killed the colt.

87
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,760
No. Somebody may have killed
him, but it wasn't adam.

88
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:36,704
He's been here all morning
greasing the buckboard.

89
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,680
You say somebody took a shot at
you? Who could it have been, ma?

90
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,696
Well, I don't rightly know.

91
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,616
Matter of fact, there were some
deer hunters hanging around.

92
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,040
Yes, sir. They asked me if
they could hunt down our fence,

93
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:52,960
And I told 'em yes.

94
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:57,568
You go and get your supper off
the stove, and no more fightin'.

95
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,616
You gonna see those men, ma? That's right.

96
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,536
Put that wheel
back on.

97
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,965
So, you found us.

98
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,654
You covered up
your trail pretty well.

99
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:43,310
As soon as the boy told me
somebody tried to kill him,

100
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,230
I knew it was you.

101
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:51,405
Being a lawyer hasn't done
your shootin' any good, grant.

102
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,734
Yeah. Maybe losin' this some
years ago didn't help any either.

103
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,653
You owe me for a colt.

104
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,637
Doggone critter
was too lively.

105
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:06,157
When he crawled off,
he spoiled my aim.

106
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:09,069
You can't start it all over
again, grant. I won't let you.

107
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,404
You're gettin' kind of uppity, ain't you?

108
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:15,596
He's a rand. I knew it the
first minute I laid eyes on him.

109
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:18,764
He brought to mind that you
was married to my brother.

110
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,716
And a score still isn't
settled for his death.

111
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:23,916
You lost a brother,
I lost a husband.

112
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,836
I don't want
any more vengeance for him.

113
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:29,196
I never figured
that you would.

114
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,779
That's why I swore that
I'd kill every rand on earth.

115
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,923
And he's
the only one left.

116
00:11:34,988 --> 00:11:36,843
How in tarnations
you get him?

117
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:39,148
Let's say the lord
gave him to me.

118
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:43,211
Let the boy alone, grant.
He's innocent.

119
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,162
That night
ended it for him.

120
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:47,082
A night like that
don't have an end.

121
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:49,675
What happened to him there
will make him do things just-

122
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,722
Just like spirits were
whispering in his ear saying,

123
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,770
"kill, kill.
You've got to kill."

124
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:57,995
Spirits may talk to you, but they won't
to him. I don't believe in your spirits.

125
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,810
Maybe not, but someday you'll wish
I hadn't missed my shot today...

126
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:04,490
Down on the draw. That's
one day that'll never come.

127
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:07,499
He's a good boy.
I love him like my own son.

128
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,273
What makes you think
that boy loves you?

129
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,825
Well... I'll go back
to santa fe.

130
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:22,505
I swear I think I'll leave that
rand alone, let him grow up,

131
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,281
Just to see what happens to you when
he's big enough to start asking questions.

132
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,009
Don't forget your money
for the colt.

133
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,385
Thanks for reminding me.

134
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,305
This'll help me
bring him up.

135
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,208
Did you find 'em, ma?
Did you talk to 'em?

136
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:58,280
Why, sure I did. It was
them deer hunters all right.

137
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,064
They shot the colt.

138
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,815
Put the team up, adam, and
feed 'em. You help him, thor.

139
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,152
Come in the house with me,
son. I want to talk to you.

140
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:23,846
Jeb, how much
do you remember...

141
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,990
About coming
to live with us-

142
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,910
About the night
I brought you here?

143
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:33,190
You must remember something. Not much.

144
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,430
You can tell me, jeb.

145
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,398
I get mixed up
when I think about that.

146
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,854
I remember flashes...

147
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,997
And boots runnin'.

148
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:48,837
You know your parents are
dead. That's why I took you in.

149
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:51,973
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:55,110
But you don't remember them?
No, ma'am.

151
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:58,854
Sometimes I try to think
about it. I don't know.

152
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,886
My head hurts.

153
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,444
It gets all blurred.

154
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,900
Sometimes
the lord protects us...

155
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,588
By letting us know
only what's needful.

156
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:14,405
What you don't remember
doesn't matter.

157
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,325
You belong here
with us now.

158
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,205
Don't ask questions
of the past.

159
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,020
It has no answers
for you.

160
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:25,507
Grow up strong in the love
that's here for you.

161
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,036
As long as you love in
return, nothing can happen.

162
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,307
And you do love us,
don't you, jeb?

163
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,612
I'm sorry
I started the fight.

164
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,659
Well, son,

165
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,443
After today you boys won't
have anything to fight about.

166
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,163
Adam, thor, come here.

167
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,939
Now, pay heed to me,
you children.

168
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,947
I'll have no more arguments as
to who owns what on this ranch,

169
00:14:55,012 --> 00:14:56,867
Colts or anything else.

170
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:59,170
Everything we have
or ever will have...

171
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,378
Belongs to you three
from this day on.

172
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,066
You mean, everything has
to be that way? Yes, adam.

173
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:06,017
Have you any objection
to that?

174
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,794
Not for thor and me,
but I have for outsiders.

175
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,866
There are no outsiders here.

176
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,297
You three are together.
You yourselves...

177
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:21,330
Are the best and finest
thing there is- a family.

178
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,194
You promise
not to forget that?

179
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,250
I mean all three of you.

180
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,834
All right.
Thor, stop scratching.

181
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,649
Go in the house and get some coal
oil, put it on those chiggers.

182
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:39,569
Adam, you find
the sheep scissors.

183
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:42,737
I'm gonna cut yours
and jeb's hair tonight.

184
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:45,841
Jeb, we've always called you
by your right name- rand.

185
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,761
Would you like to use
our name instead?

186
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:52,209
If you don't mind, I'd like to use my own name
- jeb rand.

187
00:15:57,713 --> 00:15:59,568
All right, jeb.

188
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,711
You know how it was
after that.

189
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,816
Ma's idea worked like she
wanted it, pretty near.

190
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,119
Anyhow, we seemed
more like a family.

191
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,391
We were close,
the four of us.

192
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,334
That lasted
for a long time.

193
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,767
It lasted until that day
I rode into town.

194
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,942


195
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,406
detail, halt!

196
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,061
Right face!

197
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,206
About face!

198
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,573
<i>Order arms!</i>

199
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,805
Hey, what's all the shoutin' and
drum beatin' about? Ain't you heard?

200
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,061
The territory's fightin' Spain, and it looks
like we're gonna have a real shootin' war too.

201
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:16,558
Hi, jeb.
Good morning, doctor.

202
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:21,709
Hello, prentice. That's quite some
excitement you've got around here.

203
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,204
Sure is.
Gotta beat them spaniards.

204
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,349
Sure wish I could fight,
but dad won't let me.

205
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,100
Meanin' I won't lie about
his age so he can join.

206
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,500
I fought in one war. He don't
know what he's stayin' out of.

207
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,740
Here's your mail, jeb.
Thanks, bam.

208
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,980
That dress and petticoat
thorl sent for came in.

209
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:40,460
Hope it's what she wanted.
I've been keeping it for her.

210
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,211
She'll be obliged to you.
I'll tell her I saw you.

211
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,596
How's my credit, bam?
I need some tobacco.

212
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,515
Never heard anything wrong with
the credit on the callum ranch.

213
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,723
Thanks.

214
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,667
Mr. Rand?
Yes.

215
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:56,810
I heard him mention
the callum ranch.

216
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:00,907
I'm, uh, state provost, down
here to supervise recruiting.

217
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:05,835
Every outfit around about
here is sending in a quota.

218
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,946
One man apiece
to fight the spaniards.

219
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:12,619
I was sort of interested to see if
anyone was coming in from your ranch.

220
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,818
Oh, I guess this is what you
mean, sir. It came a little late.

221
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,729
Some of the outfits are sending
in every danged rider they've got.

222
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,258
Except the aged
and unfit.

223
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,553
We'll let you know tomorrow which one it's gonna be
- me or my brother adam.

224
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,569
Is that soon enough?
I guess so,

225
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,034
Unless you'd like the pleasure
of riding home tonight...

226
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:30,954
And telling the folks
you've just joined up.

227
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:36,618
Fill this out and sign it
and hand it in when you report.

228
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,721
If I'm the one that reports.
If not, adam will have to do it.

229
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,121
Give me two. The provost
seems bound and determined...

230
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,041
To get you
into this war.

231
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:50,441
It sort of appeared
that way to me too.

232
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,488
Who is that fella anyway?
What's his name?

233
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:54,728
heck, I figured
you knew him.

234
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:56,969
Ain't he some kind of kin
of yours? No kin of mine.

235
00:18:57,033 --> 00:19:00,168
I have no kin. His name's
callum, just the same.

236
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:03,561
There's a whole slew of 'em up north.

237
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:21,448
<i>halt! Order arms!
</i>

238
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:24,232
<i>The recruits are ready to be
sworn in. Is that right, boys?</i>

239
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,679
All right.
Raise your right hands.

240
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:33,832
Repeat after me. I, a citizen of
the United States, do solemnly swear-

241
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:37,606
"I, a citizen of the United
States, do solemnly swear...

242
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:41,158
That I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the United States of america.

243
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:45,223
That I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the United States of america."

244
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,230
<i>is that package for me?
Yes.</i>

245
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:03,110
The dry goods you ordered.
Oh, good.

246
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:05,669
Maybe it's my dress.
Hey, adam?

247
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:09,094
<i>Hello? When you finish up
there, come on in the house.</i>

248
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:12,356
<i>I got some business to talk
over with you. All right.</i>

249
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,276
What is it?

250
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,813
<i>"... As a soldier in
the volunteer army...</i>

251
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:28,869
"of the United States of america for a period of two years, unless sooner discharged

252
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:31,013
The first company's
leaving in the morning.

253
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:33,733
I told him we'd let him
know by then. It's not fair.

254
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:37,124
Why can't they get soldiers from the big
ranches, where there have plenty of riders?

255
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,748
Can't be helped, sis. Them
spaniards has to be beat.

256
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:44,035
I won't let either of you go. I'll ride into
town and explain we need both of you here.

257
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,052
You can only keep
one of us at home, sis.

258
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:49,636
But you can help pick which one it's
gonna be. That's a job I don't want.

259
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,099
Should we tell ma,
or decide without her?

260
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,499
Decide for ourselves,
I say.

261
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:57,251
Tell her after.

262
00:20:57,316 --> 00:20:59,171
Well, ad, what do you say?
How are we gonna settle it?

263
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:01,859
I'm agreeable
to anything you suggest.

264
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:04,962
All right, I'll draw numbers with
you, run you a race or cut cards.

265
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,882
That would be your way
of deciding it.

266
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:10,018
This isn't a game. It's
serious. I'm serious.

267
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:13,507
How about a toss? That's the
quickest. That's fine with me.

268
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,419
Then let me toss it.
Flip it high.

269
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,187
If it's tails, ad goes.

270
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:23,138
Heads, it's jeb.

271
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:36,162
It's heads.
Jeb, you're the one.

272
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,250
It was a fair toss.

273
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:43,170
So be it.

274
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,377
Well, there's no use
stalling around any longer.

275
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:48,545
Adam, will you cut out
a horse for me? Sure.

276
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,225
I'll get going tonight. I
better go to ma now and tell her.

277
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:25,632
Don't let anything
happen to you, jeb.

278
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:28,768
I couldn't stand that. If
anything happened to you-

279
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:30,688
Nothing's gonna happen, ma.

280
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:33,375
I'll come back.

281
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,968
Why, sure,
I know you will.

282
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,111
One of you had to go.

283
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:40,254
Perhaps it's best
this way.

284
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:53,983
Good-bye, jeb.

285
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:58,847
Good-bye, ma.

286
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:43,036
Good-bye, jeb.
So long.

287
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,052
Come home, jeb.

288
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:48,700
Until I do, maybe you'd
like this for a keepsake.

289
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:51,196
I guess it sort of
slipped out of your hand.

290
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,500
Right through the window too.

291
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,091
It didn't slip.
I threw it.

292
00:23:56,156 --> 00:24:00,188
I don't blame you. You wanted to keep
adam here, so you lied about the toss.

293
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:03,675
I wanted to lie,
but I didn't.

294
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,586
If I had, it would've been
to keep you here,

295
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:09,339
Not adam.

296
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:12,283
You felt that way too?
The same way I felt.

297
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:16,795
I was supposed
to be your sister.

298
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,130
That's how it's been
ever since we were kids.

299
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,491
Only I stopped being
your sister,

300
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,954
And you've never been
my brother.

301
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,994
But I had to go on
every day pretending,

302
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,642
Watching you all day,
letting you touch me,

303
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:33,562
And at night
going in my room,

304
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:35,707
Lying there,
thinking about you.

305
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,970
I wish I had lied.

306
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:42,202
I wish I had cheated about
the toss and kept you here.

307
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,873
Wait for me.
You know I will.

308
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:07,032
I'll leave him at the ace high livery
stable. Pick him up in the morning.

309
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:10,137
So long. Give them spaniards
heck for me. I'll do that.

310
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:38,903
Come on!

311
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:07,718
<i></i>

312
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,286
Feel any better?

313
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:20,197
I feel all right. Well, I don't
know whether you were lucky or not.

314
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:22,533
You were sure
dreaming something.

315
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,453
I've heard a lot
of fever chatter in my time.

316
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:28,389
Don't bother with it much when it's
concerned with war, but yours was different.

317
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,269
Seemed to come from way back
somewhere when you were a kid.

318
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,901
- What'd I say?
- Something about boots and flashes of light.

319
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:37,924
<i>Somebody hurt
or killed.</i>

320
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,220
<i>Does that mean anything
to you? I don't know.</i>

321
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:43,684
But you gotta tell me what I said,
doc. Every word. I wanna know.

322
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:45,924
Don't upset yourself.
Your fever's gone,

323
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:47,973
And the nightmare is with it
wherever they came from.

324
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:50,404
<i>That leg is gonna
get you home.</i>

325
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:52,324
Home?

326
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,723


327
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,707


328
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,635


329
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:40,019
The stage is in!

330
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:45,075
No, no. The provost wants to pay for it.

331
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,986
Oh, thank you, sir,
for the treat.

332
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:53,938
It's a pleasure to treat a man who takes
so little interest in today's occasion.

333
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:57,554
See, personally, I too have
small interests in a doggone hero.

334
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:59,953
We think a great deal of jeb
out at the ranch.

335
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:03,569
Too bad they don't have a brass
band for a good cattle tally.

336
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,489
Understand you've been doing
a fine job out there.

337
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:07,409
I don't believe
I know your name, sir.

338
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:11,248
It's the same as yours
- callum. I'm the prosecutor at santa fe.

339
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,865
We're kin, you know. Then I'm
glad to make your acquaintance.

340
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,224
listen to that.

341
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,513
The ladies deprecate killing, but
my, how they admire a war hero.

342
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:26,193
Jeb, you know, comes by
his instincts naturally.

343
00:28:26,257 --> 00:28:29,663
He inherited them.
Is that so?

344
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:32,447
I don't believe I ever talked to
anyone who knew jeb rand's kinfolk.

345
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:36,064
Sometime, take a little ride for
yourself up into glorietta township...

346
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:40,768
And see what the records have
to say about a family named rand.

347
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,711
Good luck.

348
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,959
"for this meritorious
and exceptional action,

349
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,535
"I now award you
the medal of honor...

350
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,351
Of the United States
of america."

351
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,967


352
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,846
Good to see you, ma. My,
you're looking fine.

353
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,078
Hello, thor.
Hello, jeb.

354
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,518
<i>Welcome home, jeb.
Thank you, adam.</i>

355
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:27,358
Glad to be home. Come on. Ride up here
with me. Let's get on out to the ranch.

356
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:30,206
Once you're sleepin' in your own bed
and eatin' at your own table, jeb,

357
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,949
Maybe you'll forget all about the killin'
and shootin' the general talked so much about.

358
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:36,700
Don't have to forget it,
ma.

359
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:38,620
Never think about it.

360
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,173
Giddap!

361
00:29:57,661 --> 00:30:00,699
I was savin' this
for thanksgiving.

362
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,708
I guess we're havin' a
kind of thanksgiving anyway.

363
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,779
Thank you. Welcome to my son, jeb.

364
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:12,699
Thank you, ma.

365
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:20,955
To you, jeb,
and you must drink to me.

366
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:25,115
<i>It would be fittin'
to have some music.</i>

367
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,243
Remember, boys?
"the londonderry air."

368
00:30:32,572 --> 00:30:34,490
Why, you used to
sing it.

369
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:43,482


370
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:48,730
once more, I'll awaken

371
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:51,962
the sweetness of

372
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:56,954
thy slumbering strain

373
00:30:57,018 --> 00:31:00,761
in tears our last

374
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:05,305
farewell was taken

375
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,409
and now in tears

376
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:12,345
we meet again

377
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,377
yet, even then

378
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:21,496
while peace was singing

379
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:24,408
her halcyon song

380
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:29,464
o'er land and sea

381
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,440
though joy and hope

382
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:37,496
to others bring ye

383
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,376
she only brought

384
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,191
new tears

385
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:46,935
to thee

386
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:57,335
Yes, jeb, you'll find
changes, and good ones too.

387
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,399
We got four new sections of the
richest fillery you ever saw.

388
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:05,366
I guess any kind of cattle talk's boresome
after you've been away from it for a while.

389
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:07,446
Like a fellow
said to me today:

390
00:32:07,512 --> 00:32:10,230
"they don't play
brass bands for cattlemen."

391
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,958
Speaking of cattle, jeb, you're
entitled to read this tally.

392
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:20,471
You'll find all the operations in
here written down, clear and legal.

393
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,614
I don't have to read, ad.
I can trust your tally.

394
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,597
Well, it's there
for you to see.

395
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:27,030
I've got your share
all marked off.

396
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:29,301
I call it the rand share.

397
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:35,350
Sit down, ad. Won't you
have some more coffee?

398
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,686
No, thanks.

399
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:41,430
Well, it's been a big day. One
day's the same as another to me.

400
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:43,349
I gotta be
in the saddle at sunup.

401
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:46,229
Good night, ma.
Good night, son.

402
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:48,756
Good night.
Good night, adam.

403
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:58,005
I'll finish up. You go along. No, you-

404
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:01,524
Well, all right.
I'm all tuckered out.

405
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:07,540
Good night, jeb.
Good night, ma.

406
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,340
All these trips to town
tire me out.

407
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:14,260
<i>jeb?</i>

408
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:18,259
You know somethin'?

409
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:22,004
What?
There's a moon out.

410
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:26,579
Wait till
I get my shawl.

411
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,779
Jeb?

412
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:46,402
Jeb, sweetheart,
is something wrong?

413
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,514
Thor, we ought to go away.

414
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,202
We will.
I mean right now, tonight.

415
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,122
Let's hitch up a horse
and not tell anyone.

416
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:55,426
We'll wake up a preacher over
in town and make him marry us.

417
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,346
You know I'll marry you.

418
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,459
What are we waiting for?

419
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:01,986
I want you
to come court me.

420
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:05,442
I know that seems silly when
we grew up together, but...

421
00:34:05,506 --> 00:34:07,585
I want to pretend
we didn't.

422
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,050
That's why you've got
to come sparkin' me.

423
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:13,634
Do you mind? You can get
dressed up real fashionable.

424
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,346
So will I. I'll have two
chairs out in the gallery.

425
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,425
I'll bring out
some lemonade.

426
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,505
We'll sit there
and talk.

427
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:25,793
You can ask me if I'll let
you smoke, and I'll say yes.

428
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:28,033
I'll have
a piece of sewing.

429
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,953
What'll we talk about?

430
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,833
Oh, sort of
parlor talk.

431
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:36,768
The words will be like stitches that
sew and pull on our lives together.

432
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,425
After a while,
you can hold my hand.

433
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:47,712
You're not supposed to kiss
me till you bought a ring.

434
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:51,328
Oh, jeb,
can you understand?

435
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,304
Can you see it
in my way?

436
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,351
Thor, I've never
belonged here.

437
00:34:56,416 --> 00:35:00,703
I don't know why. I always have
a feeling something's after me.

438
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,943
It's a bad feeling
I can't explain.

439
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:06,175
Lots of times I'm happy,
but it's still there.

440
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,095
Thor, I've gotta be with you.

441
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,367
We've got to have a chance. Let's
get away before something happens.

442
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:12,287
Please, sweetheart.

443
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:14,367
We're gonna get married,
jeb.

444
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:16,863
We're not gonna spend the rest
of our lives doing crazy things...

445
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:19,678
Because you think
something's gonna happen.

446
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:23,550
We're not gonna run away at night
like a couple of stagecoach robbers.

447
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:25,470
I love you, jeb.

448
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:28,926
But if we're gonna get married,
can't it be the way I say?

449
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,318
Please, sweetheart?

450
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:38,654
I only hope
it turns out that way.

451
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:48,670
after that, I had to be alone
and think things out.

452
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:51,774
We hadn't really quarreled,
and yet somehow we had.

453
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,325
It seemed as if we couldn't
understand each other anymore.

454
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,597
One day, I rode up
into butte country.

455
00:35:57,662 --> 00:36:00,253
Came straight to this place,
just as if I'd known the way.

456
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,132
There was something in my life
as ruined as that house.

457
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:32,139
That house was myself.

458
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:34,123
I'd seen it
a million times before-

459
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:36,843
The fireplace,

460
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,763
The trap door.

461
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:53,035
Out back,
there was some cattle bones.

462
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:04,266
And then as I walked around the
side, I came on some unmarked graves.

463
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:07,434
All of the sudden,
I couldn't breathe.

464
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:13,609
If that house was me, what part
of me was buried in those graves?

465
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:11,383
Some folks has me beat.
When there's work to be done,

466
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:14,742
That's the time they decide to go
ridin' all over the countryside.

467
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:17,847
Honey, I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.

468
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:19,927
I'm sorry.
I just took a little ride.

469
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:21,847
How long since
you've had something to eat?

470
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,822
I don't know, but I'm not
hungry. I'll fix you some coffee.

471
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,382
That'll be fine.
Right now I wanna see ma.

472
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,159
You got no more sense
than a duck.

473
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:41,110
Well, I had sense enough
to come home.

474
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,926
Why, thor was fit to be
tied worrying over you.

475
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,942
I was sort of
worried myself.

476
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:49,910
I got halfway lost. I strayed
away up in that rimrock country,

477
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,830
Up bear paw butte way.

478
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,565
Bear paw butte? Now, what
crazy thing made you do that?

479
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:59,222
You and thor
have a nip up?

480
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:01,525
Thor had nothing to do
with my going.

481
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,389
I wanna ask you
something, ma.

482
00:39:06,454 --> 00:39:08,309
I've been wondering about
that old ranch up there.

483
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:11,317
a goat couldn't live
in that range.

484
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,237
A burro would starve.

485
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:16,180
People lived there once
though.

486
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:18,548
You know the ranch
I mean?

487
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:21,556
I just remembered.
Seems to me there was...

488
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:24,052
Someplace up there
long ago.

489
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:26,036
Seems to me
I've been there before.

490
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,204
Ma callum, does that ranch
have to do with me?

491
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,635
Don't ask me questions,
jeb.

492
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,908
Did I come from there
as a boy?

493
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:36,116
Is that where you took me
from all those years ago?

494
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:38,035
Is that why
I remember it?

495
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:42,963
I told you not to look
backward. Look ahead.

496
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:46,483
I obeyed you.
I've lived like you said.

497
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:49,171
All my life, I've known
I didn't really belong here.

498
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:53,395
I couldn't love. I couldn't
return your kindness.

499
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,827
Is there something
the matter with me?

500
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,779
I wanna understand, ma.
You've gotta tell me.

501
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:01,139
There's nothing the matter
with you, jeb.

502
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:03,539
That ranch might mean
more to me than it does to you.

503
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:06,098
Anyway, I get upset
talking about it.

504
00:40:06,163 --> 00:40:08,370
A person's gotta find
his own answers.

505
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:11,762
We're alone, each of us,
and each in a different way.

506
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:15,314
I won't be alone.
I'm gonna marry thor.

507
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,234
I want you to.

508
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:20,657
But when you do, you've
got the future to live for.

509
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:23,857
I've got the past
to live with too.

510
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:26,833
My children will have to live
with it. Stop vexing me, jeb brand.

511
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:29,361
I'm giving you my daughter
for your wife.

512
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:33,233
Isn't that enough for you? Doesn't
that show you that you're loved?

513
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:35,249
Go away from me with
your doubts and your-

514
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:38,417
Your bear paw butte
and your crazy long rides.

515
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:40,978
Leave off vexing me.

516
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:42,929
You told me once
not to question you,

517
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:46,161
But the questions
keep coming back.

518
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:49,041
If you won't answer me, I'll have to
look somewhere else for the answer.

519
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:06,704
<i>Goin' out, jeb?</i>

520
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:09,679
Thought I'd go and see if mr. Dingle's
faro game is still as crooked as ever.

521
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:12,176
<i>Good idea.
What'd you say?</i>

522
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,960
I said it was
a good idea.

523
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:18,190
How'd you like to take two or three thousand
dollars along, stake you in the game?

524
00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:24,239
Maybe one of us is crazy,
but I don't seem to follow you.

525
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:27,439
The tally book would've made it kind of
simple if you'd taken the trouble to read it.

526
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:29,903
That's why I gave it to you
when you came home.

527
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:32,654
Only now, I got
this year's crop added.

528
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,863
Two or three thousand would be no
more than your share of the profits.

529
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:37,838
A third
to each of us,

530
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:39,758
The way ma wants it.

531
00:41:39,824 --> 00:41:43,662
That's mighty generous. More than
I deserve, least ways expected.

532
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:46,893
Thanks. Here's something
else you don't know.

533
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,454
All the time you were in the army,
we've been banking money for you.

534
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,926
Fifteen hundred dollars. There's
just one thing wrong with it, jeb.

535
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,517
That money came out of the
ranch, and you didn't earn it.

536
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,437
I've been workin'
my share and yours too.

537
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:05,709
I don't aim to
keep on doin' that.

538
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:08,397
<i>I never asked you to. No, but
you never tried to help me either.</i>

539
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:11,052
Your foot's been well for a month,
and you've been drawin' that money...

540
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:13,836
For lyin' in the shade.

541
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:18,188
I was lucky if I didn't have six of my riders
stretched out alongside you playin' pitch.

542
00:42:18,254 --> 00:42:20,492
Oh, sure, I know
you were a hero once,

543
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:24,685
But I've had my belly
full of that too.

544
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,052
We don't pay off
in medals around here.

545
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,828
It was too bad
I came home at all.

546
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:33,067
If I hadn't, you would've had
the ranch and the tally money...

547
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:34,987
And my share of everything
all to yourself.

548
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:39,628
This "share and share alike" doesn't sit
any better with me than it does with you.

549
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:43,052
I'm thinkin'
the same way you are.

550
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:44,971
This ranch isn't big enough
to hold the two of us.

551
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,004
There's a way
we can settle that.

552
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,251
Jeb, you promised me
there'd be no trouble.

553
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:54,394
I wanna hear
what he has to say.

554
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,083
How can we settle it?
I'll buy you out.

555
00:42:57,148 --> 00:43:00,539
Suppose I don't wanna sell?
Then you buy me out.

556
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:03,739
Now, you know I can't
do that. Adam, please.

557
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:07,770
Jeb, don't say anything more.
Won't you do that much for me?

558
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,042
Thor,
you keep out of this.

559
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:13,146
Well, what's your notion,
if you don't like mine?

560
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:16,090
When I went to war,
we settled with a toss.

561
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:18,010
I kept this.

562
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:19,930
Maybe if it suits you,
we can spin it again.

563
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:23,385
There might be some luck
in it for me this time.

564
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:27,129
I'll toss you. My share against
yours. One of us stays, and one goes.

565
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:29,594
Oh, you can't!
You either!

566
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,569
It's wrong and crazy.

567
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:36,601
Ever since we were little, we've all been here together
- the three of us.

568
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:39,641
This is no way to change it
if it's going to be changed.

569
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:41,624
One toss.

570
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,833
You wanna spin it?
Adam, I beg you!

571
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:45,753
And you, jeb,
don't do it!

572
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:48,985
Winner take all.
One toss.

573
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:50,904
Call it.
Heads.

574
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:58,105
I might've known
that cartwheel was bad luck.

575
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:01,849
Well, I'll be ridin'
in town.

576
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:03,960
I'll hire a rig tomorrow
and come back for my things.

577
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:08,503
No, you won't.
You ain't got no things,

578
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:10,552
Exceptin'
what you're wearin'...

579
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:13,143
And this!

580
00:45:25,798 --> 00:45:27,877
Tomorrow I'm coming back,

581
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:29,988
And you're coming with me.

582
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:31,908
If he tries to stop me,
I'll kill him.

583
00:46:18,404 --> 00:46:20,930
ma'll never let you do this.
Maybe she'll have to.

584
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,330
Then I'll go with him
in the morning.

585
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:25,825
When he comes, I'll be ready. You'd never.

586
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,098
Not if it meant
leavin' the ranch.

587
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:31,682
The ranch isn't everything
to me. It isn't a husband.

588
00:46:31,746 --> 00:46:35,042
"the ranch be a husband."
you're talkin' crazy.

589
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:37,025
It's been a wife
to you, adam,

590
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:38,945
Because you don't have
a wife.

591
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:43,041
You just have the ranch.
Well, I don't belong to it.

592
00:46:43,106 --> 00:46:46,785
You can take me off that dogeared
tally book you carry around.

593
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,953
You hate me then?

594
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,873
I love you.

595
00:46:51,938 --> 00:46:55,169
I always thought the three
of us would never be apart.

596
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,793
Three. Three!
You're always sayin' that!

597
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,712
But why does he count?
It's you and me.

598
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:04,384
Now you're the one that's talkin'
crazy. I want a home of my own.

599
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,777
Grant callum knew him.
Knew his people too.

600
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:10,336
Told me to look up the records
in glorietta county.

601
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:13,248
And did you? Sure I did,
and I found something.

602
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,776
A family named rand
did live there once.

603
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:17,888
I found out
enough for me-

604
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:20,224
A reason why I'll
never let you marry him.

605
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,943
I don't care
what your reason is.

606
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:25,503
You're talkin' like
a back-fence gossip.

607
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:28,159
Do you think that kind of
talk means anything to me?

608
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:30,464
Nothing in the world
can change the way I feel.

609
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:33,344
I always knew
you cared for him.

610
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:38,623
I guess...
I never knew how much.

611
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:41,503
Looks as if we're gonna have
to set things right.

612
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,454
You'll-
you'll go after him, then?

613
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,374
You'll ride in town
and bring him back?

614
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,206
I'll do it.
I'll ride in town tonight.

615
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,126
<i></i>

616
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:05,374
Mr. Dingle, can you take
this man's I.O.U.?

617
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,286
Yes, I'll take it.

618
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:12,094
Now throw him out.
Yes.

619
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:21,277
Keep your hands off me,
will ya?

620
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:34,973
What's the matter, jake? Don't
you take money in here anymore?

621
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,053
Any money you put on
this bar is counterfeit.

622
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:39,164
I'm saving you
for the wheel.

623
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:42,844
Did you run into a fellow who
nearly convinced you? Well, he tried.

624
00:48:42,908 --> 00:48:45,948
You know, I flipped this dollar
twice with adam. I lost both times.

625
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:48,476
Last time, I went to war.
This time, I left the ranch.

626
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:51,643
You left the ranch?
You mean that?

627
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:54,427
Maybe you've played
into a cold deck.

628
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:56,476
Well, I guess it's all
for the best. Oh, sure.

629
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,868
A man's luck's bound to change
sometime. You appear lucky to me.

630
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:03,963
Don't you want some action for this
dollar? It's kind of a keepsake.

631
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:06,747
Oh. Well, many a man's been
down to his last dollar...

632
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:09,051
Before the change
does come.

633
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:12,507
I guess you just
want this dollar.

634
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:16,251
All right,
go ahead and take it.

635
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,994
Hey, jeb, you won.

636
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:32,842
Let it ride. Oh, no. Too
many angles at this game.

637
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:34,762
I'd rather play poker.

638
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,034
You've had a run of good luck,
jeb. Why don't you pull out?

639
00:49:49,098 --> 00:49:50,953
Oh, once more.
Oh, brother.

640
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:54,089
Luck's sure riding on your shoulder.
Probably clean this place out.

641
00:49:54,154 --> 00:49:56,009
Oh, I've got a feeling
you're through.

642
00:49:56,074 --> 00:50:00,104
Well, I've got about $1,500 here
that says you've got a wrong feeling.

643
00:50:00,169 --> 00:50:02,088
Joe, get me a new deck.

644
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:22,023
Well...

645
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,295
There it is.

646
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:27,143
I'll tell you what I'd do with that money
if I were you. Don't tell me. Let me guess.

647
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,927
I'd buy into this business.
I'll sell you a piece of it.

648
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:32,455
You don't mean that?
Yes, I do.

649
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,503
You know why?
Why?

650
00:50:34,568 --> 00:50:37,063
Well, because
people trust you...

651
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:40,103
And, well,
I'm just honest jake dingle.

652
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:43,623
You know, I might
take you up on that.

653
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:45,543
I'll be looking for
a business by and by.

654
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:49,030
Well, you think it over and let me know.
We'd make a great combination, you and myself.

655
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:52,902
And if you do come in, I'll
teach you how to handle cards.

656
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,854
It don't hurt anything.

657
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:57,318
Good night.
Good night, partner.

658
00:50:57,383 --> 00:50:59,590
And take good care
of that money.

659
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:26,340
as I walked out
on the streets

660
00:51:26,406 --> 00:51:28,324
of laredo

661
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,477
I walked out on
laredo one day

662
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:36,100
I spied a cow puncher

663
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:39,172
wrapped up in white linen

664
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:43,972
wrapped in white linen
as cold as the clay

665
00:51:44,038 --> 00:51:49,700
beat the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly

666
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:54,851
play the dead March
as you carry me along

667
00:51:54,917 --> 00:52:00,452
take me out to the prairie
and lay the sod over me

668
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:05,699
for I'm a poor cowboy
and I know I've done wrong

669
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:07,619


670
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,051
and lay the sod over me

671
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:24,499


672
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,224
<i>Adam.</i>

673
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:09,660
Now, let us continue.

674
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,187
I disagree with the learned
corner. I still maintain...

675
00:55:12,252 --> 00:55:15,228
We're a legal body,
properly impaneled.

676
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:18,363
Sit down, grant.
This is my hearin'.

677
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:22,459
I don't need no county prosecutor
to tell me how to run it.

678
00:55:22,524 --> 00:55:24,602
Furthermore,
since it so happens...

679
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:27,419
Said prosecutor's name
is callum,

680
00:55:27,483 --> 00:55:30,971
I wouldn't want to say he's prejudiced
'cause I'm clean-minded, I am.

681
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,594
It's my duty to see
the law administered...

682
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,994
Regardless of family
or anything else.

683
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:41,114
Gentlemen, I swear from
the bottom of my heart...

684
00:55:41,178 --> 00:55:43,898
<i>I never felt more like
quitting my job than right now.</i>

685
00:55:43,962 --> 00:55:47,066
Because I well know what
this case may cost a family-

686
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,674
A sorrowing mother
and sister-

687
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:52,330
<i>Who have already lost
one son, one brother...</i>

688
00:55:54,122 --> 00:55:57,194
And, if my guess is right,
may lose another to the law.

689
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,425
Miss callum,

690
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,409
On the night
in question,

691
00:56:06,474 --> 00:56:09,288
Did you witness a quarrel
between your brother and jeb rand?

692
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,353
Yes, I did.

693
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:16,905
And did you hear the accused utter
any threat with regard to adam?

694
00:56:19,066 --> 00:56:20,920
Yes.

695
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:22,969
<i>You may repeat
what you heard.</i>

696
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:28,504
Jeb said he was comin' back
next day to get me...

697
00:56:29,977 --> 00:56:32,728
To take me with him
and marry me.

698
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,352
He said if adam tried to
stop him, he'd kill him.

699
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:55,815
Perhaps you fellers
might like a spot of tea.

700
00:56:55,881 --> 00:56:59,175
now, here's the size of it.

701
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,023
Here's two men that had
no use want for each other.

702
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:05,607
All that's been testified, but that
ain't what we're here to decide.

703
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,455
It looks like jeb
shot him down like grant said.

704
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:12,934
Hold your horses. It's grant's
word against jeb's, he way I see it.

705
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:16,886
Jeb never was no murderer. I figure
there's plenty of doubt on both sides.

706
00:57:16,951 --> 00:57:19,382
The heck you say. Nobody
can get along with ad callum.

707
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:22,262
Let's get somethin' done. I gotta
get home and look after my stall.

708
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,454
Shut up!

709
00:57:26,518 --> 00:57:30,037
You fellows saw the general
pin a medal on jeb.

710
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:32,854
Ah, he weren't decoratin'
no ambusher...

711
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:35,734
But a man that fought
fair and square for his country.

712
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:38,869
It don't stand to reason that a man that
shot down a dozen fellows in battle...

713
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,653
Would shoot down his own brother
without givin' him a chance.

714
00:57:41,718 --> 00:57:44,053
If he had to drill him,
he'd do it right.

715
00:57:44,118 --> 00:57:47,189
Uh-uh-uh! And if he done it
right, then it ain't no killin',

716
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:49,109
But a lawful fight.

717
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,508
And hereabouts we ain't
so danged uncivilized...

718
00:57:51,574 --> 00:57:54,548
A man can't win a lawful fight without
gettin' his neck in a noose for it.

719
00:57:54,614 --> 00:57:57,620
Pass the tea.

720
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:11,252
Thank you.

721
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:20,532
May I speak to you
before you go, mrs. Callum?

722
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:25,267
I know you don't hold with the
verdict of the jury, but it was fair.

723
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:27,411
I never murdered adam.

724
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:31,507
You'll be shorthanded
at the ranch.

725
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:35,347
If you'll permit me, I'd be happy
to come back and help you out.

726
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,907
I make this offer
most sincerely.

727
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,083
Get away from me,
jeb rand.

728
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:42,675
I know how you
must feel about me,

729
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:45,874
But I was hoping that
in time I could change that.

730
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,299
It's too late
to change anything.

731
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:52,402
Mother, let's go.

732
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:54,866
No. I'll
have my say.

733
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,010
You may have cleared
yourself in there,

734
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,994
But not with me.

735
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:01,746
With me you're walkin'
up the gallows steps.

736
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:05,585
I built that gallows.
I tied the noose.

737
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,826
All the love I had
for you is dead.

738
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:12,657
Stay out of my sight.

739
00:59:12,722 --> 00:59:16,625
If you cross my section line,
I'll set the dogs on you.

740
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,568
Is that the way
you feel?

741
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:37,264
you'd made pretty clear
how you felt,

742
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:39,951
So that fall
I put in with jake.

743
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:43,728
I found out how dull gambling could be
when I stood on the other side of the table.

744
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,384
Once or twice we got some news about you
- come on, baby!

745
00:59:46,448 --> 00:59:48,304
How you'd been sick,

746
00:59:48,368 --> 00:59:51,279
How you were living out at
the ranch and not seeing anyone.

747
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:54,383
I watched for you to come
into town, but you never did.

748
00:59:54,448 --> 00:59:58,063
It was fall again before I heard
young prentice, the storekeeper's son,

749
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,943
Was taking you and your mother
to the dance.

750
01:00:01,008 --> 01:00:04,878


751
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,303
do-si your daughters
and do-si your old men

752
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:16,494
do-si your brothers to the
ball and do-si back home

753
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:22,189
allemande left
and the old left hand

754
01:00:22,254 --> 01:00:25,134


755
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:29,518
meet your partner
and promenade

756
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,758
it's on fire
and I don't care

757
01:00:31,822 --> 01:00:34,701
and park your gal
in an easy chair

758
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:39,053
Would you like a glass
of punch? I'd love it.

759
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:41,038
Excuse me a minute.
Thanks.

760
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:56,524
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
the next will be la varsouviana.

761
01:00:57,997 --> 01:01:00,460
May I have the pleasure?
Please go away.

762
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:02,572
Better dance, or people
will look at you.

763
01:01:02,637 --> 01:01:05,516
I'd rather have people look at me
than dance with somebody I hate.

764
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:08,845


765
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:51,242
What a coward you are.

766
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:55,498
A coward wouldn't have
come here to dance with you.

767
01:02:11,851 --> 01:02:14,857
hold it. All right, folks,
that's enough of our slow dance.

768
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:16,938
Here's a chance
to swing your ladies,

769
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:20,842
So get your partners
for a chicken reel.

770
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:25,449


771
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:30,952
Uh... You saw thor dancin'
with jeb, didn't you?

772
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:34,088
Why, yes. Come on, son. Let's
you and I have a little talk.

773
01:02:34,153 --> 01:02:37,224
Now, you forced her. Jeb rand, the
man she hates most in the world,

774
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:39,496
Forced her to dance with him.
I was getting her some punch.

775
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:41,896
You're escorting her this
evening, aren't you? Yes.

776
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:45,096
Did you bring her here so she could be
insulted? No. I wouldn't let that happen.

777
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,360
Well, it's happened.
What are you gonna do about it?

778
01:02:48,425 --> 01:02:50,312
Pardon us, gentlemen.

779
01:02:59,385 --> 01:03:02,264
Mr. Callum, all this
started long ago.

780
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:05,879
It isn't my fight. Then you're
not the man I took you for.

781
01:03:05,944 --> 01:03:08,183
I'll do what's right.

782
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:12,022
If you let him get away with it,
she'll never speak to you again.

783
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:15,767
Did she say that? If she
didn't, she's thinking it.

784
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:18,519
And there's something else
she's thinking of.

785
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,582
It's the death
of her brother.

786
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:28,918
Mr. Callum, sir...
I'm not much good with a gun.

787
01:03:28,983 --> 01:03:31,542
Maybe you'll have some help.

788
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:34,678
Go up to the alley.

789
01:03:34,743 --> 01:03:37,558
If he's an honest wheel, you'll
find him in the back room.

790
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:39,734
Shoot him
through the window.

791
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:43,382
No, sir, I-
I can't do that.

792
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:45,910
But I'll make him
come out to me.

793
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,700
What's the matter, jake?
Couldn't you find any partner?

794
01:04:07,765 --> 01:04:09,876
You found one you
shouldn't have- thor.

795
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:12,564
Young prentice is comin' over
after you for it. Prentice?

796
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:16,245
He's on his way over here now. Get
the drop on him, jeb. Go on out front.

797
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,724
First adam, now prentice.

798
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:23,028
<i>Man, you
gotta get going.</i>

799
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,652
I don't wanna get
the drop on him, jake.

800
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:27,604
What are you gonna do?

801
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:29,779
Step out in the alley
and make myself scarce.

802
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,178
<i>Mr. Rand.
What do you want?</i>

803
01:04:44,244 --> 01:04:47,635
I've come because
of what you did to thorley.

804
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,610
Go on home, prentice.
I don't want to hurt you.

805
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:53,490
Defend yourself,
mr. Rand.

806
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:14,895
I wouldn't try that
if I were you, grant.

807
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,479
Let's get him
in the office.

808
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,478


809
01:06:52,495 --> 01:06:56,110
I- I did it
for thorley.

810
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,461
I'm sorry, prentice.

811
01:07:12,205 --> 01:07:15,148
it was self-defense
just as they said,

812
01:07:15,213 --> 01:07:19,084
Yet he was one more part of
the mystery of people hating me.

813
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,996
How I saw the boots
of the pallbearers,

814
01:07:22,062 --> 01:07:24,172
The flashes of light.

815
01:07:27,245 --> 01:07:31,532
I had that feeling some lost and
awful thing come over me again.

816
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:51,435
I wasn't sure whether killing
prentice was my fault,

817
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,635
Whether it was due to some
badness locked up in me.

818
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,067
But I was sure
of my love for you.

819
01:07:57,131 --> 01:08:00,491
That was the only hope
and the only answer.

820
01:08:00,908 --> 01:08:04,043
If love could come out of all this,
we might still have some chance.

821
01:08:04,108 --> 01:08:05,963
We might live.

822
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:09,051
Right then I knew
I had to have you.

823
01:08:09,467 --> 01:08:13,322
I'd have to climb across
two graves to get to you,

824
01:08:13,387 --> 01:08:16,329
But nothing in the world
could hold me back.

825
01:08:31,755 --> 01:08:33,770
Who's that comin'?

826
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,474
It's jeb rand.

827
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:42,666
He's comin'
to call on me.

828
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:46,377
Jeb rand?
Callin' on you?

829
01:08:46,442 --> 01:08:48,649
I knew he'd come.

830
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,921
I've been expectin' him.

831
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,272
You've no right to expect him,
much less to see him.

832
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,528
I'm askin' him in.

833
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,087
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Won't you come in?

834
01:09:22,152 --> 01:09:24,071
Thank you.

835
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:28,775
It was kind of you
to receive me.

836
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,263
Please sit down.

837
01:09:32,328 --> 01:09:34,247
Thank you.

838
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:41,446
Would you like
some coffee?

839
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,622
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

840
01:09:43,687 --> 01:09:47,014
Oh, it's no trouble.
We were just going to have some.

841
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,310
I'm sorry we have
nothing else to offer.

842
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,902
In this house all we have
is a little wine.

843
01:09:52,967 --> 01:09:56,134
That's just for christmas
and holidays.

844
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:59,174
Seems to me I remember
something about that wine.

845
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:06,629
That's a music box
ma had sent from santa fe.

846
01:10:06,694 --> 01:10:11,557
I know. It plays
"the londonderry air."

847
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:18,277


848
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:43,091
It's an old-fashioned tune.
Some people don't care for it.

849
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,235


850
01:10:51,892 --> 01:10:55,507
May I smoke?
Or would that annoy you?

851
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:57,490
No, of course not.

852
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:18,194
This is a sampler I'm makin'.
I'm not very good at it.

853
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:27,026
Here we are courting, the way
you asked me to long ago.

854
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:29,906
But it's all different.

855
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:33,458
<i>You sitting there.
Me smoking, you sewing.</i>

856
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:38,226
Just like
any ordinary people.

857
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,040
It's worse than fighting
or yelling in the street.

858
01:11:44,946 --> 01:11:48,401
- Don't you want your coffee?
- No, thanks.

859
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:53,105
Perhaps later. Why don't you sit
down in the comfortable chair?

860
01:11:53,169 --> 01:11:56,240
Company always
uses that one.

861
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:23,536
I tried to figure out what crazy
game you were playing with me,

862
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,456
And I couldn't.

863
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,623
But I knew I'd play it out
with you right till the end.

864
01:12:43,712 --> 01:12:46,431
Am I seeing things?
Well, I declare!

865
01:13:13,694 --> 01:13:16,540
Good night, jeb
I'll see you tomorrow?

866
01:13:16,606 --> 01:13:18,525
Of course.

867
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:39,389
Thor.

868
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:45,852
<i>Thor! Come here!</i>

869
01:14:04,635 --> 01:14:06,714
- What is it?
- Come closer.

870
01:14:20,604 --> 01:14:22,842
Turn the lamp up.

871
01:14:25,531 --> 01:14:29,593
That's right.
I want to look at you.

872
01:14:29,658 --> 01:14:31,513
I haven't changed, mother.

873
01:14:31,578 --> 01:14:36,026
What have I taught you that showed
you how to bring dishonor on us?

874
01:14:36,091 --> 01:14:39,034
I've brought you
no dishonor.

875
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:43,993
Jeb gave me this tonight.

876
01:14:44,058 --> 01:14:46,073
I'm going to marry him,
mother.

877
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:50,521
What's in this that I don't
understand? Do you love him then?

878
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:54,874
I have only one thought
every minute of my life:

879
01:14:54,938 --> 01:14:56,793
How much I hate him.

880
01:14:56,858 --> 01:14:58,873
But you wear his ring.

881
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:06,808
If I were a man,
I would've killed him long ago.

882
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:09,880
After adam's death.

883
01:15:09,945 --> 01:15:14,073
Then he killed prentice
and came courtin' me.

884
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:17,368
All of a sudden,
killin' wasn't enough.

885
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:19,640
I had to have more-

886
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:22,551
Much more- to use up
all the hate I have in me.

887
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:29,208
Thor, I'll sell this place.
I'll go away.

888
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:31,544
I won't stay here
and see this thing happen.

889
01:15:33,336 --> 01:15:36,088
Perhaps that may be best.

890
01:15:36,153 --> 01:15:40,790
You go away for a while.
We'll be together again soon.

891
01:15:40,857 --> 01:15:43,191
No woman ever lived...

892
01:15:43,256 --> 01:15:46,807
Who could go through
with what you're planning.

893
01:15:46,872 --> 01:15:49,591
No woman but me.

894
01:15:49,655 --> 01:15:53,590
'cause it's taken all my life
to teach me what he is.

895
01:15:53,655 --> 01:15:56,790
He put shame
and grief on us,

896
01:15:56,855 --> 01:16:00,950
And now he'd like to squeeze out
the last drop of it by havin' me.

897
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,942
He wants me...

898
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:08,342
And I'll marry him.

899
01:16:08,407 --> 01:16:13,141
That moment when he thinks he
has me, he'll lose everything...

900
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:16,502
Because that's when
I'm going to kill him.

901
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:21,302
For richer,
for poorer.

902
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:23,221
For richer, for poorer.

903
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,141
In sickness
and in health.

904
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,061
In sickness and in health.

905
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:29,237
Until death
do us part.

906
01:16:29,302 --> 01:16:31,285
Until death do us part.

907
01:16:42,646 --> 01:16:44,820
What made you do that?

908
01:16:44,885 --> 01:16:49,076
I don't know. Such fine young
folks, and nobody at the wedding.

909
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:55,092
I have a surprise for you.
I've bought you a house.

910
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,076
All right, charlie.

911
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,684
Well, now you've seen it.
That's why I sent for you.

912
01:17:11,748 --> 01:17:16,226
Bein' as we're all callums here, I don't
have to tell you what we're gonna do about it.

913
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:19,363
Sure enough, you'll get
yourself in trouble, and us too.

914
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:22,210
Yeah. Times have changed
since all this started, grant.

915
01:17:22,276 --> 01:17:24,418
You can't ride herd
on the law no more.

916
01:17:24,483 --> 01:17:27,426
You're telling me about the law? No, sir.

917
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:32,674
You thinkin' like him, that
you're not goin'? That's right.

918
01:17:35,715 --> 01:17:38,562
I think we're all goin'.

919
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:09,344
When I heard
about the auction,

920
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:13,184
I figured it'd be better for me to buy
it than see it pass on to strangers.

921
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:16,032
Allow me. I know it's a
custom to carry the bride in,

922
01:18:16,098 --> 01:18:18,655
But perhaps
we can let that go.

923
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,208
I always figured when I got
married I'd have all the trimmings.

924
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,095
You may notice some changes. There are some
fixings I brought here from kansas city.

925
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,879
Mighty pretty place
you've got here.

926
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:58,014
Charlie, would you take mrs. Rand's
bags into the front bedroom, please?

927
01:18:58,079 --> 01:18:59,998
I sure will.

928
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:42,778
Come in.

929
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,954
You're very beautiful.

930
01:20:53,018 --> 01:20:55,642
<i>Thank you.</i>

931
01:20:55,707 --> 01:20:57,881
I hope you'll
be comfortable here.

932
01:20:57,946 --> 01:21:01,945
In this house it takes very
little to make me comfortable.

933
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:06,073
I brought you some wine.

934
01:21:08,122 --> 01:21:11,512
It's customary, I believe,
to drink to a bride's health.

935
01:21:11,577 --> 01:21:14,232
You're very gallant.

936
01:21:54,328 --> 01:21:56,183
So you know.

937
01:21:56,248 --> 01:21:59,063
You and I are much alike.

938
01:21:59,128 --> 01:22:02,358
There are times when
I can read your thoughts...

939
01:22:02,424 --> 01:22:05,750
By asking myself what I'd do
if I were in your place.

940
01:22:05,816 --> 01:22:09,045
I know that's an irritating
quality in a husband,

941
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:10,998
But it may help
to make things easier for you.

942
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:15,382
Don't come any closer.

943
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:18,006
You sure
this is all right?

944
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:20,598
Prentice missed
because the light was bad.

945
01:22:20,663 --> 01:22:22,742
Adam was too anxious.

946
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:25,365
I'm glad you don't suffer
from those handicaps.

947
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:27,765
No, I don't.

948
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,797
Do you know
why you missed me?

949
01:22:35,862 --> 01:22:38,197
Because I hate you so,
my hand shook.

950
01:22:40,342 --> 01:22:44,405
Your hand shook,
but not because you hate me.

951
01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:46,452
Put the gun down, thor.

952
01:22:57,941 --> 01:23:01,651
Oh, jeb. Hold me.

953
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:03,636
Hold me.

954
01:24:24,722 --> 01:24:27,697
<i>Jeb? What is it?
What's the matter?</i>

955
01:24:27,761 --> 01:24:31,664
I've gotta leave. There are men
outside. They want to kill me.

956
01:24:31,729 --> 01:24:34,064
It's all
grant callum's doing.

957
01:24:34,129 --> 01:24:37,136
I don't know why, but he's wanted
me dead ever since I can remember.

958
01:24:37,201 --> 01:24:40,879
Oh, take me with you. I can't, but
we can be together in a little while.

959
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:43,727
There's an old ruined ranch up
by bear paw butte. Meet me there.

960
01:24:43,793 --> 01:24:47,792
How do I find it? Take the trail through
rimrock canyon, across the county line.

961
01:24:47,857 --> 01:24:49,776
Oh, I'll be there.

962
01:29:56,595 --> 01:29:59,826
Looks like he jumped clean off this
bluff here. Aw, he just outrun us.

963
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:03,794
Let's give it up. I got a
hunch I know where he is.

964
01:30:03,859 --> 01:30:07,921
Russ, go fetch ma callum
and bring her to bear paw butte.

965
01:30:15,474 --> 01:30:19,345
It's all going to happen again,
but I don't care now.

966
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:22,033
I know there's one big answer
I've always looked for:

967
01:30:22,098 --> 01:30:25,489
Why I was alone;
why everything went wrong;

968
01:30:25,554 --> 01:30:28,369
Why I had hate in me
instead of love.

969
01:30:28,434 --> 01:30:31,760
There was a black dog
riding my back and yours too.

970
01:30:31,825 --> 01:30:34,961
I guess we've lost our chance, but
there's nothing we can do about it now.

971
01:30:35,025 --> 01:30:39,280
Oh, but there is. We've got to
get away from here, both of us.

972
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,607
Jeb rand, we know you're
in there. Come on out!

973
01:31:23,535 --> 01:31:25,567
We'll give you
two minutes!

974
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:32,990
Are you hurt?

975
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,310
I remember now. Those dreams I've
been having ever since I was a kid.

976
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,421
the flashes were gunfire,

977
01:31:43,486 --> 01:31:46,494
And the man shooting
was my father.

978
01:31:46,558 --> 01:31:50,045
My sister lay on the floor dead,
and my brothers were dead too.

979
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:53,981
The boots and spurs,
they were my father's.

980
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:02,909
Then he was hit.

981
01:32:02,974 --> 01:32:06,045
I saw him fall.
I knew he'd been killed.

982
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:11,260
I was too scared to yell,
so I just stayed there.

983
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:14,429
Then a man came in-
grant callum.

984
01:32:15,774 --> 01:32:19,420
He was dragging a woman
with him. She was your mother.

985
01:32:21,053 --> 01:32:23,549
He told her
to look at her rand now.

986
01:32:23,613 --> 01:32:27,100
I remember those words-
"your rand."

987
01:32:27,165 --> 01:32:31,228
He asked her if the love she had
for him was worth what she'd done.

988
01:32:31,293 --> 01:32:34,780
Then he threw her down
and dragged my father out.

989
01:32:38,172 --> 01:32:40,699
Jeb, darling,
how horrible.

990
01:32:41,884 --> 01:32:44,252
It must mean
that my mother-

991
01:32:44,317 --> 01:32:46,651
One minute! Come out,
or we'll come and drag you out!

992
01:32:46,716 --> 01:32:48,571
Come on.
I won't.

993
01:32:48,636 --> 01:32:51,451
You're doing this for me because
you're afraid I'll be hurt.

994
01:32:51,516 --> 01:32:53,787
I don't want to live without
you. We've gotta fight.

995
01:32:53,852 --> 01:32:57,082
we're comin' out.
Don't shoot.

996
01:32:57,147 --> 01:32:59,355
Throw your gun out!

997
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:06,490
Put your hands up.

998
01:33:26,139 --> 01:33:30,777
Oh! Oh, I told him to fight you,
to die fightin' if he had to!

999
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,114
Let me go!

1000
01:33:38,682 --> 01:33:41,481
Oh, mother, you won't
let them do this!

1001
01:33:41,546 --> 01:33:43,912
So, grant, you're gonna
have it your way at last.

1002
01:33:43,978 --> 01:33:46,089
I told you I'd wait
until he was grown.

1003
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:49,576
Well, now he's growed and he gets
his legacy. Only it's made out of him.

1004
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:53,032
He earned it just as his
father earned the lead he got...

1005
01:33:53,097 --> 01:33:55,431
When he stole
my brother's wife.

1006
01:33:55,498 --> 01:33:58,248
Then it was jeb's father!
You loved him.

1007
01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:02,248
Yes, only she forgot she
was married to a callum.

1008
01:34:02,313 --> 01:34:04,824
Bring a horse here.
Get me a rope.

1009
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:13,319
Jeb told me
about the feud.

1010
01:34:13,384 --> 01:34:15,527
Now I understand
the part I didn't know.

1011
01:34:15,592 --> 01:34:18,439
It all started because
of your love, your guilt.

1012
01:34:18,504 --> 01:34:20,711
That's why you'd like
to see jeb hanged.

1013
01:34:20,776 --> 01:34:24,103
You don't know what you're
sayin'. This is none of my askin'.

1014
01:34:24,168 --> 01:34:29,030
You never gave jeb a chance. You never told
him the truth so he could protect himself.

1015
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:32,390
- I was trying to protect you.
- That's a lie.

1016
01:34:32,456 --> 01:34:36,678
- You were ashamed.
- I've paid for what I did.

1017
01:34:36,743 --> 01:34:38,950
I gave the boy a home.
I took him in.

1018
01:34:39,015 --> 01:34:44,102
That paid for all the killin's? For the
way my father died, and jeb's father?

1019
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:47,366
Well, it didn't!
You loved his father.

1020
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:50,053
<i>Or are you ashamed now
to remember how you loved?</i>

1021
01:34:50,118 --> 01:34:52,262
No. I loved his father.

1022
01:34:52,327 --> 01:34:56,229
You failed him, mother,
and you failed yourself.

1023
01:34:56,294 --> 01:34:59,781
You lost the man you loved.
He died here.

1024
01:34:59,846 --> 01:35:03,173
But my man won't,
unless they kill me too!

1025
01:35:04,998 --> 01:35:06,917
You can't!

1026
01:35:36,005 --> 01:35:40,547
I'm sorry, jeb, for all the wrong I did ya.

1027
01:35:40,613 --> 01:35:43,908
Forgive me. You didn't have to ask me that.

1028
01:35:43,973 --> 01:35:47,107
You've given me back my life. Oh, mother.

1029
01:35:47,172 --> 01:35:50,915
I told you once, jeb,
never to look back.

1030
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:54,180
Look ahead.
I tell you that again now.

1031
01:35:54,244 --> 01:35:58,818
You couldn't then.
But now I can and will.

1032
01:35:59,779 --> 01:36:02,658
Take your wife
home, jeb.
