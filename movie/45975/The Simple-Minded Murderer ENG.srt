1
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,723
No rats here, I hope?

2
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,725
No, I've been here before.

3
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,929
No one will find us here.

4
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,082
- I've some pork too.
- No thanks. No more.

5
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,771
Eat plenty and you won't feel cold.

6
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,406
- Cold?
- No, I'm fine.

7
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,286
It's nice here.

8
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,247
<i>Anna dearest, rose of Sharon.</i>

9
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,964
<i>I can feel your soft shoulders
through the dress.</i>

10
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,720
<i>Little flowers, with greenery behind.</i>

11
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,168
<i>How lovely.</i>

12
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,608
<i>Like long, soft grass.</i>

13
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,446
<i>It's prettier than the dress.</i>

14
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,881
<i>If only you could walk.</i>

15
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,045
<i>Anna, my dear one.</i>

16
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,723
<i>Then I'd kick your wheelchair
to pieces.</i>

17
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,963
<i>No, why?</i>

18
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,284
<i>I'd give it to someone who needed it.</i>

19
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,204
<i>That would be better.</i>

20
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,682
<i>But you and I, my love</i>

21
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,366
<i>would go for a long walk</i>

22
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,050
<i>breathing in {he sweet smell
of new-mown hay</i>

23
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,806
<i>and perhaps dance with each other.</i>

24
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,965
<i>Quite still.</i>

25
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,806
<i>It's fish making rings</i>

26
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,680
<i>and white water-lilies bobbing
on the surface.</i>

27
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,244
<i>The yellow ones
are sticking up above it.</i>

28
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,042
<i>If you drop a piece of bark into
the eddies it will go with the boat.</i>

29
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,649
A lot of things
are hard to understand...

30
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,008
Collywobbles!

31
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,323
That's what comes of gobbling.

32
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,450
<i>Your hair smells so nice.</i>

33
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,365
<i>It's best to strike you
with the back of my hand.</i>

34
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,250
<i>The skin is thinner there</i>

35
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,769
<i>and I can feel how soft you are.</i>

36
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,044
<i>I'm thinking of my mother, who's dead</i>

37
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,966
<i>lying under heavy, black earth...</i>

38
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,568
<i>She was so soft too, under her chin</i>

39
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,885
<i>and I used
to press my lips against it.</i>

40
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,603
<i>Bu! her arms always shook
as if there was an engine in them.</i>

41
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,482
<i>I never saw my father in real life</i>

42
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,882
<i>but there's a picture of him
in the museum.</i>

43
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,884
<i>Not his face but his body.</i>

44
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,521
<i>The head's a real officer
they painted in.</i>

45
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,162
<i>Dad was a model for the body.</i>

46
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,883
<i>He was a brave soldier.
I've got his head here.</i>

47
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,531
That's my father.

48
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,883
<i>He's an angel in heaven now,
defending everyone.</i>

49
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,005
<i>Do you remember my sister Vera</i> 7

50
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,889
Remember?

51
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,928
What?

52
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,525
Remember Vera?

53
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,844
She came all the way
from Stockholm by train.

54
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,441
She has pretty clothes too.

55
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,484
<i>She's married to an engineer</i>

56
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,361
<i>and they live in Stockholm,
same as the King.</i>

57
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,887
<i>He's so rich they can go
where they like.</i>

58
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,249
<i>He's thinking of buying
a farm down here.</i>

59
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,360
<i>They've been in Germany and America.</i>

60
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:36,087
<i>They can take a boa! or an airplane,
wherever they like.</i>

61
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,926
Vera!

62
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,965
Why, Sven!

63
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,805
Anna and Mrs Andersson.

64
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,325
Erlandsson.

65
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,641
It's Bengt.

66
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,724
<i>Vera gave me a bible.</i>

67
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,281
<i>She's kind now</i>

68
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,684
<i>but she was with the others
when I was little.</i>

69
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,881
If you touch me I'll hurt my hand.

70
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,251
<i>Once she made me eat porridge
with hen shit in it.</i>

71
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,608
You stupid idiot!

72
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,891
<i>Everyone said I was an idiot
and she hated it.</i>

73
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,841
<i>I went to school for a time
and learned to read.</i>

74
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,527
<i>Mostly the "Triumph"</i>

75
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,525
<i>but also Vera's bible.</i>

76
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,006
<i>“Thy lips, O my spouse,
drop as the honeycomb</i>

77
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,450
<i>honey and milk are under thy tongue.</i>

78
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,091
<i>And the smell of thy garments!</i>

79
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,802
<i>Is like the smell of Lebanon.”</i>

80
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,326
That enough?

81
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,962
I'd have taken more of there was room.

82
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,921
Lift the pig down
and it'll be easier to load.

83
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,529
Carefully now.

84
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,042
Christ, the pig's loose!

85
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,522
Well, that's that.

86
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,764
It's late, I must get to town.

87
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,923
I was wondering if...

88
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,044
What are you gaping at, you idiot?

89
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,125
Go to hell, you bloody idiot!

90
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,564
I should have killed him then.

91
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,247
The bastard.

92
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,369
I didn't dare.

93
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,722
Carrying on like that... Bastard!

94
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,771
"I'm fed up here. I'm off to town."

95
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,129
"All the best, Mum. Vera."

96
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,886
<i>Vera sent money from Malmö</i>

97
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,126
<i>but things got worse after she left.</i>

98
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,002
<i>Mum began to get pains
in her stomach.</i>

99
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,482
<i>I don'! know what I! was
but she seemed to shrink and try up</i>

100
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,929
<i>like poisoned mice.</i>

101
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,841
<i>She went from farm to farm
doing odd jobs.</i>

102
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,884
<i>Anyone at home?</i>

103
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,688
<i>Sven, are you ready?</i>

104
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,481
Why is it so dark here?

105
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,007
What's the matter with Mrs Olsson?

106
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,244
I don't know.

107
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,802
She's been lying like that all night.

108
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,283
She hasn't spoken a word.

109
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,088
Then I suppose she's dead.

110
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,087
Yes, she's dead.

111
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,643
I'm awfully sorry.

112
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,322
Is Mum dead?

113
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,607
Yes.

114
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,969
She made a peaceful end. No pain.

115
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,962
Is Mum dead?

116
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,169
Don't be sad now.

117
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,086
You're to go to Mr Höglund today.

118
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,164
Good thing you're being taken in hand.

119
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,643
I'll notify the vicar and the police.

120
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,769
Is Mum dead?

121
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,287
Get yours things and come with me.

122
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,571
Mr Höglund wants you
to start work today.

123
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,041
Is Mum dead?

124
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,762
Take the chest

125
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,401
and I'll take the sack.

126
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,090
Come on, Sven. Let's go.

127
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,724
That's Mr Höglund's house.

128
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,720
You're to sleep
in the stable over there.

129
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,325
It's the door over there.

130
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,562
The first pen on the left.

131
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,325
Go on, in you go!

132
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,609
Are you the new hand?

133
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,090
Take these and fill them up there.

134
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,923
Here are some sandwiches for you.

135
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,442
Welcome.

136
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,169
Are you the idiot who is to work here?

137
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,051
We'll <i>soon</i> get you moving.

138
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,047
I'm Höglund, the manager.

139
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,646
I've seen you before.

140
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,725
Call me sir. Understand?

141
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,007
"Yes, sir."

142
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,811
Yes, sir.

143
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,129
Are you strong?

144
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,366
<i>Good.</i>

145
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,568
You're to work here on the farm

146
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,929
and lend a hand at my workshop in town.

147
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,288
I'm sorry about your mother.

148
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,203
Where's Ӓspet?

149
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,928
Straight ahead.

150
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,726
They found they'd given him
the wrong bottle

151
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,727
so they went back and said:
"still alive?"

152
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,761
"That was hydrochloric acid you drank."

153
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,802
And he said: "No wonder it made
a hole in the jerry."

154
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,126
It's dangerous
to drink hydrochloric acid.

155
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,491
That's what is so funny.
He drank acid instead of brandy.

156
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,610
He might have died.

157
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,526
It's no good telling you funny stories.

158
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,767
Take that thing out,
and be careful of it.

159
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,367
It's worth several thousand.

160
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,485
You can hang her on that hook there.

161
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,008
I've got him! I've got him!

162
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,084
- What am I to do with him?
- Drown it.

163
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,283
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight

164
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,288
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen...

165
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,366
No I can't. I can't.

166
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,725
Easy Sven. I'll take it.

167
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,811
I know, it's bloody awful.
But someone's got to do it.

168
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,362
<i>“And I saw another mighty angel
come down from heaven</i>

169
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,651
<i>clothed with a cloud:
and a rainbow was upon his head</i>

170
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,690
<i>and his face was as it were the sun</i>

171
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,085
<i>and his feet as pillars of fire.”</i>

172
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,446
You stay here!

173
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,886
Ever since the day we married...
I get so bloody mad.

174
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,961
Out you go, kids. Look sharp!

175
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,048
I'm damned if I'll stand it.

176
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,011
Stop blubbering. Stop your whining.

177
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,688
I can't stand it.
Stop, for Christ's sake!

178
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,361
Get this off to Håkanssons today.

179
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,363
Bengt's ill today, sir.

180
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,681
You drive then.

181
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,724
How the hell does this work?

182
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,247
There's no oil.

183
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,290
Where the hell's the oil?

184
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,840
Over there.

185
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,048
This is molasses, but it may do.

186
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,806
Molasses!

187
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,525
If you pour that in
the whole engine will seize up.

188
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,050
I'd like to see his dad
if he wrecks the engine.

189
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,600
Oil is what it needs.

190
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,680
My mum darned my stockings.

191
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,971
My mum's dead. Dead and buried.

192
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,489
You damned idiot.

193
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,761
The word's not idiot. It's idiot.

194
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,487
Start by putting it in first gear.

195
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,884
That's fine. No, never mind those.

196
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,443
Now gently with the clutch...

197
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,081
No, no! Take it easy!

198
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,482
Now drive straight ahead. No, wait!

199
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,409
To drive forwards you put it in first.
Easy now. No! Stop!

200
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,369
- Shall I put them in the bows?
- Yes.

201
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,808
I can row.

202
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,090
We'll have a snifter first.

203
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,721
No, Sven, you stay here.

204
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,645
Hi, there! Come here!

205
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,130
Come here!

206
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,845
Like a sweet?

207
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,445
Nice day.

208
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,000
Yes.

209
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,369
You can keep me company
while they swim.

210
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,887
I'd like to.

211
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,006
Do you like wild strawberries?

212
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,050
- Like it?
- Yes. Oh, look!

213
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,248
I'm sorry.

214
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,609
- Like some?
- No.

215
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,889
- Go on.
- I've had some.

216
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,284
"Do you know him, do you know him,
the little tailor?

217
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,046
Do you know him, do you know him,
the little tailor?

218
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,091
One evening he cut off
the head of the apprentice

219
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:48,485
He threw the head
into the river and then he ran away."

220
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,484
Have you heard it before?

221
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,844
We met Sven down by the lake.

222
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,723
Like some coffee?

223
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,562
Axel, run and get some cups.

224
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,805
Do sit down.

225
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,130
I haven't laughed so much for ages.

226
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,682
- I <i>could never do it.
- Go on, by!</i>

227
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,161
So you have to sleep with the animals.

228
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,331
In a pen.

229
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,482
It's warm.

230
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,770
It's damned wicked.

231
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,684
Let's play grab.

232
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,770
I've been waiting four hours
for the bugger.

233
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,164
- Like some, Sven?
- No, thanks.

234
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,926
- You don't want any?
- No.

235
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,888
Coming! Coming!

236
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,521
- Hurry up, I haven't all day.
-Sorry, sorry!

237
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,330
You drunken sot.

238
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,961
Up you get.
I must be in Malmö) before six.

239
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,847
You bloody boozer.

240
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,968
I'm not well.

241
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,168
Sven can drive.

242
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,686
- Can you drive?
- I've no license.

243
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,604
I asked if you can drive.

244
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,286
A little.

245
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,166
Put on his uniform then.

246
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,568
Stop!

247
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,451
I forgot my briefcase.
It's up in the bedroom.

248
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,970
Come in!

249
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,644
What are you doing up here?

250
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,088
I've come for the briefcase.

251
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,364
It's there.

252
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,326
What the hell
is it doing on the road...

253
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,683
Why didn't it look
where it was going...

254
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,890
Where the devil have you been?

255
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,281
Out hunting.

256
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,086
Here's a little present.
You can make it into sausages.

257
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,530
The man carrying it
is a Nobel Prizewinner.

258
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,729
Tell him to take the corpse out
to the kitchen.

259
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,644
You can give him some hogwash.

260
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,089
Yes, sir. I will see to it at once.

261
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,563
Sit here and keep out of the way.

262
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,970
This is the stuff to give the troops.

263
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,729
We must drink while we're sober,
as the miller said before being drowned.

264
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,687
He couldn't see,
so a waiter had to help him.

265
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,561
There was a huge bowl of prawns
and his eyes lit up.

266
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,644
Do you know what he said? Hi, girls!

267
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,008
But he was blind.

268
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,644
He had a glass eye
and it was phosphorised.

269
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,684
Bring the bill!

270
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,685
I've dropped the money under the table.

271
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,482
You can crawl in and pick up
what you have the heart to.

272
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,325
I'm not going to count it.

273
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,370
Thank you, sir, thank you.

274
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,841
He's half-jew.

275
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,729
Yes. At least.

276
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,167
Now to my place for a sauna.

277
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,961
Yes. And I know some
nice female bath attendants.

278
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,283
I'll go and call them up.

279
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,807
Come along, you boozers.
Let's get started.

280
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,851
Welcome.

281
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,329
In with it.

282
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,370
You do live in style.

283
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,603
Bet you bloody life I do.

284
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,481
Put me down, I'm sober.

285
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,804
Down to the cellar and the sauna.

286
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,451
You can go out to the kitchen.

287
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,446
I'll tell him to carry the case down.

288
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,525
Take the champagne down to them.

289
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,329
Put the champagne over there.

290
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,923
- Vera!
- Hallo.

291
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,327
Come over here.

292
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,045
You're so old, my dear. So bloody old.

293
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,365
Why must one grown so bloody old.

294
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,002
What do you want, you hideosity?

295
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,004
What's the time?

296
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:43,120
Speak up! You bloody idiot.

297
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,363
As late as that.

298
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,129
It's prize-giving
for the best stallion today.

299
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,047
Get my clothes! I'm going home.

300
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,290
I thought I heard something.

301
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,930
It was only Sune.

302
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,211
<i>It's only the postman on his bike.</i>

303
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,602
<i>He always talks to himself.</i>

304
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,607
<i>He's in charge of money
and parcels and letters.</i>

305
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,006
<i>He talks to someone inside him
but they don't call him an idiot.</i>

306
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,641
Mind the train, Simple Simon.

307
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,520
Go to hell, you bastards.

308
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,606
Watch out
or you'll get a sock on the jaw.

309
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,051
<i>“And the angel trust in his
sickle onto the earth</i>

310
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,441
<i>and gathered the vine of the earth</i>

311
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,241
<i>and cast it into the great wine press
of the wrath of God.</i>

312
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,563
<i>And the wine press
was trodden without the city.</i>

313
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,727
<i>and blood came out of the wine press.”</i>

314
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,363
I'd like to speak to Mr Höglund.

315
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,364
He's in the office.

316
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,326
It was about the rent, sir.

317
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,201
Oh yes, it's due today.
You're late, by the way.

318
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,524
You'd better pay it to Wallin,
I'm going home now.

319
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,845
But I've no money. We've been ill.

320
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,925
Can't I have a respite till the spring?

321
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,402
You're crazy.
It's for this year's bookkeeping.

322
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,371
You must pay it tonight.

323
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,286
Can't I have a respite?

324
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,731
I don't want to be unfair.

325
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,451
What's today? 3rd December.

326
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,683
You can bring the money on Xmas Eve.

327
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,004
But I can't scrape it together by then.

328
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,004
It's impossible.

329
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,651
You can sell your fine cart-horse.

330
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,371
I want the money on Xmas Eve.

331
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,889
Or out you go. With a flea in your ear.

332
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,451
The bastard. The sodding bastard.

333
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,801
<i>I'm no better than the beasts.</i>

334
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,885
<i>No wonder I can't go to church.</i>

335
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,966
<i>My wages are nil.</i>

336
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,528
<i>But Höglund gets money
from the public relief</i>

337
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,887
<i>for having me here.</i>

338
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,407
<i>"I water my couch with my tears.</i>

339
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,122
<i>Mine eye is consumed because of grief.”</i>

340
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,761
<i>This meadow</i>

341
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,486
<i>and the castle</i>

342
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,562
<i>and the woods</i>

343
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,847
<i>and the fields</i>

344
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,050
<i>are mine as far as the eye can see.</i>

345
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,886
<i>My estate is under my mercy</i>

346
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,205
<i>and my domains for thousands of years.</i>

347
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,124
<i>But this is hidden from most.</i>

348
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,684
<i>I have drawn a line in {he air
with the ray of my eyes</i>

349
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,366
<i>and made an invisible fence
round all this estate</i>

350
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,322
<i>and enclosed the very air above</i>

351
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,291
<i>though you cannot understand.</i>

352
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,724
Sven!

353
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,450
You're to help Mrs Höglund
with the Christmas cleaning.

354
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,567
Stop that squabbling.
Can't you be nice to each other?

355
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,531
At least on Xmas Eve.

356
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,002
I've finished now.

357
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,163
<i>Anyone at home?</i>

358
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:24,327
Here's Santa Claus.
It smells of Christmas.

359
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,482
Has the post come?

360
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,050
Yes, Father.

361
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,250
Can Sven clean the office windows now?

362
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,967
Good morning, sir.

363
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,524
Oh, it's you, Månsson.
About time too. Sit down.

364
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,049
Merry Christmas.
Have you got the money?

365
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,522
Yes, but it was hard.

366
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,970
I've sold the horse
and been to the pawnbroker.

367
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,647
Where there's a will there's a way.

368
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,806
Couldn't I pay by installments?

369
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,441
We're broke now.

370
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,649
You've already had three weeks.

371
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,929
I've got it all here

372
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,130
but couldn't I pay some of it in March?

373
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,568
Oh no, my friend. You pay it now.

374
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,530
That's how it is in business.

375
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,922
One, two, three...

376
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,685
Quite correct.

377
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,448
Thank you, Månsson.
I've written a receipt.

378
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,206
I'll just sign it.

379
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,571
Once again Merry Christmas.

380
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,921
Don't think I'm fussy
about such a measly sum.

381
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,484
It's the principle of the thing.
To pay on the right date.

382
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,283
I managed it this year, said the cobbler
and hanged himself on New Year's Eve.

383
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,806
What the hell do you want?

384
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,331
What's this? Why do you bring this?

385
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,364
Wait!

386
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,244
This belt is for you.

387
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,524
It's from Father.

388
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,847
Merry Christmas!

389
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,563
For the first time in these parts

390
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,122
the world's gayest abortion

391
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:29,081
Miss Flora, the legless woman.

392
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,403
She can neither walk or dance

393
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,088
but wriggles along like a snake.

394
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,890
I earn my living by being on show

395
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,965
as Flora the legless woman, you know.

396
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,364
My fiancé is a handsome man

397
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,126
who gives me kisses when he can.

398
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,362
But when he wants more than a kiss,
you see

399
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,968
he embraces my twin sister, not me.

400
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,443
And then his bliss is complete,
heigh-hop!

401
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,845
For she is the lady without a top!

402
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,083
- I'd like a ride on that.
-It's too dangerous.

403
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,527
- But I want to.
-It's risky.

404
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,570
I want to all the same.

405
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,771
- Are you sure you dare?
- I bloody well am!

406
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,081
Let me go!

407
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,451
Faster!

408
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,003
- So long.
-It was a nice evening.

409
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,731
Be seeing you.

410
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,969
Glad to meet you.

411
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,089
We'll make a good deal.

412
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,290
We have before, so why not again?

413
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,330
Vera! In that nice car!

414
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,563
For God's sake shut up!

415
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,441
- What is it?
- I've got something for you later.

416
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,365
There's that idiot.

417
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,525
Come in! Dinner's ready.

418
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,001
I was thinking...

419
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,769
You needn't let people know that...

420
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,490
That you're my brother.

421
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,289
I'll ask if you can have
a better place to sleep.

422
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,011
<i>This is...</i>

423
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,965
Father, they've come.

424
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,884
Have a go. Tn] and hit that white one.

425
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,760
It will be interesting to by.

426
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,005
Bull's eye! - Fetch it!

427
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,242
Bloody god for a pastor.

428
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:27,568
We cannot keep silent while gypsies,
Jews and others

429
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,167
sneak into our country,
poisoning our community

430
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,528
and pinching out money and work.

431
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,844
We know that resolute men
with a will of steel

432
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,922
can put a stop to it.

433
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,085
We have only to look out over the world.

434
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,607
It is happening now, my friends.

435
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,889
Let us show out firmness tomorrow

436
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:58,206
when those damn reds have their meeting.

437
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,727
We'll teach them to shut up.

438
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,762
This can be the fatal hour
of our struggle.

439
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:14,927
But today we'll muster our strength
and enjoy ourselves.

440
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,527
Three cheers for our generous host!

441
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,607
Attention!

442
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,206
Dear friends.

443
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:37,367
I hope you feel welcome
and have a good appetite.

444
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,489
We have very few of the fair sex

445
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:47,011
but I've asked my wife
and Mrs Berghald to lend a hand.

446
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,880
I'm glad to see you all here.

447
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,562
Here's the chicken.

448
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,043
Oh, my quany!

449
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,847
Cock-adoodle-doo! Wake up!

450
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,161
We're going to have some fun.

451
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,881
Put this dress on.

452
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,769
No.

453
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,047
Put it on, I say!

454
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,124
No, I won't.

455
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,886
- No, I won't.
- Do as I say!

456
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,205
Here's a little poppet
with something to drink.

457
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,411
May I have the pleasure?

458
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,531
Let him go! Leave him alone!

459
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,050
What's biting you?
Can't we have some fun?

460
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,727
What's the use of this?

461
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,246
Heavens above Sven!

462
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,085
Just look at you!
Come on in, my dear boy.

463
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,365
He must stay here.
He can sleep in the parlour.

464
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,522
It's a bloody shame.

465
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,401
Drink this hot milk. It's soothing.

466
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,088
There now. Sleep well.

467
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,646
I've come to take him home.

468
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,805
Home! He lives here now.

469
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,042
Work for me.

470
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:50,125
Like hell he does. He works for me.

471
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,603
He ran away a few weeks ago.
Now I need him.

472
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,082
You treat him like an animal.

473
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,722
Don't you talk to me like that.

474
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,364
I have the custody of this half-wit.
He has all he needs.

475
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:14,129
He's not half-witted.
He works for me and gets a wage.

476
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,205
I don't argue with bloody peasants.

477
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,686
What are we to do with the likes of him?

478
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,204
Here are your wages.

479
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,128
Don't be afraid of that Höglund any more.

480
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,522
There's an ad in the paper today.

481
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,605
"Indian Big Chief with sidecar

482
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,811
<i>only 400 kronor, good</i> as <i>new."</i>

483
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,246
- I've only got...
- You can borrow from me.

484
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,449
We'll <i>go and look</i> at <i>it tomorrow.</i>

485
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:01,251
Look straight ahead.

486
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,964
Now a nice big smile.

487
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,604
No, it's better serious.

488
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,010
That was fine. You did it very well.

489
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,402
Now drive round the yard.

490
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,848
You're ready to take your test.

491
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,924
You must get a good-conduct certificate.

492
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,684
I've got photos.

493
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,922
Have you?

494
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,571
Let's look at them.

495
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,530
It's me in all of them.

496
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,523
That's fine.

497
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:16,124
- Any first names besides Sven?
- Gösta.

498
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,565
Write your name right there.

499
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,849
There's a letter for you.

500
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,364
A letter for you, Sven.

501
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,489
Use the knife.

502
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,002
Well, I'm damned.

503
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,244
Höglund must have stopped it.

504
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,687
What has happened?

505
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,322
They won't give you
a certificate of fitness.

506
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,086
You must have it for a driving license.

507
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,529
I'll ring and ask
what the hell they mean.

508
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,205
I've spoken to the parson too.
He said you were mentally deranged.

509
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,443
And he never met you.

510
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,128
Höglund told him to say it.

511
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,046
He's like a king in these parts.

512
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,011
His word is law.

513
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,926
But I'll show the bastard.

514
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:07,968
Dear friends, my warmest thanks
to Mr and Mrs Andersson

515
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,761
for looking after me so generously.

516
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,607
Soon the hour of destiny will strike

517
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:21,242
and we will combat the enemy
side by side.

518
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,881
You cared for me, let me live with you

519
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,681
in a proper room with wallpaper

520
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,846
paid me a wage so that
I could bye this English overcoat

521
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:39,404
and take driving lessons
and apply for a driving license.

522
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:44,611
I'll gladly work till the sweat runs

523
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:49,971
because I get real money once a week.

524
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,211
<i>Mr Andersson helped me and a lawyer</i>

525
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:13,411
<i>spoke to those in authority
and the press came</i>

526
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:17,485
<i>and a doctor examined
me at the madhouse.</i>

527
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,088
<i>He said I was fit to drive
and wasn't an idiot.</i>

528
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:27,451
<i>Mr Andersson sat up every night writing</i>

529
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,081
<i>and put out a lot of money.</i>

530
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:35,484
<i>He spoke to {he police and stopped
them from taking me away.</i>

531
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,961
<i>Mr Höglund had to give in.</i>

532
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,442
<i>They gave me a certificate</i>

533
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,969
<i>and wrote that folk are no!
to be kept in a calf-pen.</i>

534
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:50,284
<i>In the end I got my license.</i>

535
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,045
<i>I got a real driving license!</i>

536
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,807
A hot dog. No mustard.

537
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,850
Simple Simon is out for a ride!

538
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,521
Fine motorbike you've got, Sven.

539
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:39,930
Where's the tooter? Is that it?

540
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,610
That's for you.

541
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,728
Goodness gracious! What...

542
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,485
Have you made this?

543
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,530
Why are we to have...

544
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,126
Because...

545
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,366
Help!

546
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,567
Help!

547
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,249
I didn't see anyone... a sack...

548
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,120
He kicked and beat me.

549
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,010
He smelled of smoke.

550
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,002
It's awful.

551
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,962
Why must the road go over my land?
It's to go through the bog.

552
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,964
Your land? You only rent it.

553
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,486
But I have a lease.

554
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:32,327
It was decided
at the meeting and all have agreed.

555
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,765
Hell!

556
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,243
Sven, wake up! The pigsties are in fire!

557
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,203
Fetch more water!

558
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,210
My lawyer wants a word with you.

559
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,602
You've been careless about your bills.

560
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:04,890
No, I've... How did you get hold if them?

561
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,247
We have our connections.

562
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:12,087
About the lease... Can't we go inside?

563
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,164
Yes, this leasehold...

564
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,245
It adjoins my land
and I'd like to take it over.

565
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,722
Is this your famous motorbike?

566
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,967
Do you keep it in here at night?

567
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,088
Yes.

568
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:44,604
Must have cost quite a lot.

569
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,048
Four hundred.

570
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,851
Where is Bengt?

571
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,651
I can't here you.

572
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:02,361
Where is Bengt?

573
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,602
He used to drive the car.

574
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,968
Oh, he quit.

575
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:12,807
He drank too much. He was fired.

576
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,848
A nice bike, this. Very nice.

577
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:34,125
Those bastards are hand in glove.

578
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:42,244
He'll just have to take it over then.

579
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,481
And the bills he has ferreted out.

580
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,928
They turn the law inside out.

581
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,130
But we'll find a way. You've had enough.

582
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,647
I'll drink as much as I want.

583
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:07,971
I suppose they'll auction
all out things now.

584
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,123
How else can we scrape it together?

585
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,808
- Have a dram, Sven.
- No, thanks.

586
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:20,329
You'll bloody well have a dram
and be human.

587
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,006
Well, it's late.

588
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,890
Let's go to bed.

589
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,969
It's your fault.

590
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,203
It's all your fault.

591
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,764
It's all because you came.

592
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,571
I can't help it.

593
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,803
Why did you come here?

594
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:06,603
You've ruined everything.
You and your motorbike.

595
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:11,402
Don't touch me, you idiot.
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

596
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,810
Darling Anna...

597
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,566
Darling Anna...

598
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:44,127
<i>Five chairs, who'll bid a krona?</i>

599
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,601
- One ten.
- One ten.

600
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,411
One twenty-five.
Going, going, gone.

601
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,448
- One thirty.
- Too late.

602
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,890
Here's a cushion with a Chinese pattern.

603
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,691
25 fire.

604
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,003
-50 fire.
- That's the way...

605
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:24,203
They've taken it!
My motorcycle!

606
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,926
They've passed through here.

607
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:25,209
Anything there?

608
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,762
- I can't see anything.
- Dive deeper.

609
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,846
It's here.

610
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,961
No!

611
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,527
"Behold, my servant shall deal prudently,
he shall be exalted

612
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,126
and extolled and be very high.

613
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,044
As many were astonished at thee

614
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:18,170
his visage was so marred,
more than any man

615
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:22,370
and his form more than the sons of men;

616
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,727
He is despised and rejected of men;

617
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:30,921
a man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief."

618
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,684
I know I can talk to him.

619
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,604
I cannot take that responsibility.

620
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:40,207
- He is such a kind man.
- He is armed.

621
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:45,491
He is an idiot. - Onwards!
