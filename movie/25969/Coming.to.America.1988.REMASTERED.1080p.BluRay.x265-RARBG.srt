1
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,259
Good morning, your highness.

2
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,675
Good morning, your highness.

3
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,467
Good morning, your highness.

4
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,016
Happy birthday, your highness.

5
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,853
Yes, it is my birthday.

6
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,645
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

7
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,524
Do you think perhaps, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?

8
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,609
Most amusing, sir.

9
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,868
Wipers!

10
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,299
The royal penis is clean, your highness.

11
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,279
His highness must be very excited today.

12
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,027
Why is that, oha?

13
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,451
Today is your 21st birthday,
which means you meet your wife-to-be.

14
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,743
Well, I'm curious, but how can a man
get excited about a woman he's never seen?

15
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,875
He certainly is quiet this morning.

16
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,169
He looks sad.

17
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,633
Is something troubling you, my son?

18
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,885
No, father.

19
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,845
Son, please.

20
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,518
I'm more than
the exalted ruler of this land

21
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,846
and the master of all I survey.

22
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,772
I'm also a concerned dad.

23
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,900
Well, father...

24
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,688
Just a moment.

25
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,408
What is he doing?

26
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,612
It looks as if he's coming here
to talk to us.

27
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:36,987
Wait right there, akeem!

28
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,826
Rose bearers!

29
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,917
Akeem, come sit.

30
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,066
Now, my son...

31
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,854
You've grown a mustache.

32
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,937
Jaffe, it has been a year.

33
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,485
So, what is it, my son?

34
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,113
Well, father, first of all,
it is things like this.

35
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,364
Like what?

36
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,203
What is the matter, dear?
You're the son of a king.

37
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,249
Why should you not walk
on the petals of roses?

38
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,875
But, mother, if there were no Rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.

39
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,672
Then it is settled.

40
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,340
From this day forth,

41
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,922
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.

42
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,966
Father, it is not just that.
It's everything.

43
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,270
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing.

44
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,066
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,
but just for once,

45
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,439
I'd like to cook for myself,
and take care of myself,

46
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,566
dress myself, wipe my own backside.

47
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,148
And why? Why can't I find my own wife?

48
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,359
Aha, so that's it.

49
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,540
We have gone to a great deal of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.

50
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,991
Since the day she was born,

51
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,874
she was taught to walk and speak
and think as a queen.

52
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,045
But, father, what if I do not love her?

53
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,424
It is normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.

54
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,256
When first I met your father,
I was terrified.

55
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,433
I must admit, I was frightened too.

56
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,512
I was so nervous I became nauseous,

57
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,316
but over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.

58
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,189
So you see, my son,

59
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,987
there is a fine line
between love and nausea.

60
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:41,241
I understand, father, but when I marry,
I want the woman to love me for who I am,

61
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,696
not because of what I am.

62
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,997
And who are you?

63
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,167
I am a man
who has never tied his own shoes before.

64
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,043
Wrong. You are a prince
who has never tied his shoes.

65
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,625
Believe me, I tied my own shoes once.

66
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,711
It is an overrated experience.

67
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,425
Good morning, your majesty.
It is another beautiful day in zamunda.

68
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,185
And, semmi, what is it now?

69
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,642
You look especially radiant today,
your grace.

70
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,771
Is that so, semmi?

71
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,353
Yes! I was remarking to my mother
the other day

72
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,564
what lovely skin the queen has.

73
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,319
Semmi,
do you not have somewhere you should go?

74
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,872
Yes. I was just about to take
the birthday boy for his daily workout.

75
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,622
Excuse me, father, and mother.

76
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,586
Have a good day, my son. Yes.

77
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,929
Akeem, what happened to the Rose bearers?

78
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,557
Now let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.

79
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,999
So you say can have a woman
who'll obey your every command,

80
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,672
but you'd rather
have a woman who has an opinion?

81
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,250
Only dogs are to obey.

82
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,586
If you love your wife,
you will value her opinion.

83
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,272
Hippopotamus shit!
You're the heir to the throne of zamunda.

84
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,351
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
a firm backside,

85
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,732
and big breasts like casaba melons.

86
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,338
So you would share your bed
and your fortune with a beautiful fool?

87
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,167
That it is the way it has always been
with men of power.

88
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,376
It is tradition.

89
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,926
It is also tradition that times must,
and always do, change, my friend.

90
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,739
Get your royal engagement t-shirt!
Royal engagement t-shirt!

91
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,324
Step forth!
Get your royal engagement t-shirt!

92
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,789
These really are delicious.

93
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,953
Yes, thank you.

94
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,714
Here, try our vintage.

95
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,338
Your majesty.

96
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,300
I am colonel lzzi...

97
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:38,728
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.

98
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,812
My blessing is granted.

99
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,864
Let the courtship commence.

100
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,567
Pardon me. Step aside, please.

101
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,325
Coming through. Excuse me! Out of the way!

102
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:02,544
Greetings, great prince.
Presenting miss Imani lzzi.

103
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:17,049
She's your queen-fo-be

104
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,807
a queen-to-be forever

105
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,482
a queen who'll do whatever

106
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:30,483
his highness desires

107
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:36,739
she's your queen-fo-be

108
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,456
a vision of perfection

109
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,875
an object of affection

110
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,581
to quench your royal fire

111
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:55,921
completely free from infection

112
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,678
to be used at your discretion

113
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:06,390
waiting only for your direction

114
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:13,447
your queen-to-be

115
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,259
May I talk to you alone for a moment,
please?

116
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,717
Excuse us for a moment.

117
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,340
So...

118
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,381
Am I not all you dreamed I would be?

119
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,762
Oh, you're fine. Beautiful.

120
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,636
It's just that
if we're going to be married,

121
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,514
I thought we should talk to each other,
get to know each other.

122
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:30,186
Ever since I was born,
I've been trained to serve you.

123
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,852
Yes, I know this.
I would like to know about you.

124
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,026
What do you like to do?

125
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,695
Whatever you like.

126
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,698
What kind of music do you like?

127
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,071
Whatever kind of music you like.

128
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,076
And I know you know what I like

129
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,770
because you are trained to know
what I like.

130
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,034
But I would like to know what you like.
For instance, do you have a favorite food?

131
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,331
- Yes.
- Good! What is your favorite food?

132
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,291
Whatever food you like.

133
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,965
This is impossible.

134
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,924
Listen, from this moment on,
I command you not to obey me.

135
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,018
No.

136
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,564
Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?

137
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,982
Yes, your highness.

138
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,235
- Anything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your highness.

139
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,238
Bark like a dog.

140
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,371
A big dog.

141
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,790
Hop on one leg.

142
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,453
Make a noise like an orangutan.

143
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,133
I see the two of you are getting along.

144
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,637
Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.

145
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,990
Fine girl, isn't she?
I told you not to worry.

146
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,828
Father.

147
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,907
About this wedding...

148
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,876
The guests are waiting, your majesty.

149
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,957
Let them wait! I'm talking to my son.

150
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,428
Come, let's go for a stroll.

151
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,226
Hello, barbar.

152
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,825
Time does fly fast, my son.

153
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,575
It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,

154
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,123
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.

155
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,332
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?

156
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,132
I am not sure if I am ready.

157
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,011
Son, I know we never
had a talk about this,

158
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,841
but I always assumed
you had sex with your bathers.

159
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,432
I know I do.

160
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,805
It's not that, father.

161
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:17,516
It's just that I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left zamunda.

162
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,773
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.

163
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,321
So you want to sow your royal oats.

164
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,864
No, it's not that...

165
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,613
You're right! Get out, see the world,

166
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,196
enjoy yourself,
fulfill every erotic desire.

167
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,374
And in 40 days,
you will come back and marry Imani.

168
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,461
But, father...

169
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,705
It is settled.

170
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,432
May I have your attention, please?

171
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:02,185
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.

172
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,397
Oha, prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.

173
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,406
Prepare the royal baggage!

174
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,244
This trip is an excellent idea.
Forty days of fornication.

175
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,544
Semmi...

176
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,131
I have something else in mind.
Tell no one of this.

177
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,458
I intend to find my bride.

178
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,948
What is wrong with the one you have now?

179
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,087
When you saw her,

180
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,827
tell me you did not you want to
rip her clothes off right then and there?

181
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,218
I want a woman that's going to arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.

182
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,052
Where will you find such a woman?

183
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,308
In America.

184
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,860
The land is so big.
The choice is so infinite.

185
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,609
Where shall we go,
Los Angeles or New York?

186
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,983
We will let fate decide.

187
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,864
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Angeles.

188
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,497
We go to New York.

189
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,834
Where in New York can one find a woman
with grace, elegance, taste and culture?

190
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,884
A woman suitable for a king.

191
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,386
- Queens.
- Queens.

192
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:36,530
Mr. frank oznowitz, please pick up
a white courtesy telephone.

193
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,499
Remember, semmi,
no one here can know I am royalty.

194
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,797
We must appear to be no different
than the average man.

195
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,294
I will not say a word.

196
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,383
British airways flight 929 to London
is now boarding at gate 15.

197
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,733
Halt!

198
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,901
You dumb fuck!

199
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,025
Take us to queens at once.

200
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,498
Are you sure
you guys want to go to queens?

201
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,077
A couple of rich fellows like you
should be in Manhattan,

202
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,208
staying at the Waldorf or the palace.

203
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,130
The palace sounds good. Take us there.

204
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:35,134
No. I want queens. And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.

205
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,881
Whatever you say, pal.

206
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,592
What part of queens you want?

207
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,229
Take us to the most common part.

208
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
That's easy.

209
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,898
If there's one thing queens has a lot of,
it's common parts.

210
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,114
What does dumb fuck mean?

211
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,680
This shitty enough for you?

212
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,936
Yes, this is perfect.

213
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:09,523
Fascinating. Semmi, look at this.

214
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,527
America is great indeed.

215
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:18,403
Imagine a country so free,
one can throw glass on the streets.

216
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,826
You must be out of your goddamn minds!

217
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,450
- You're crazy!
- I am not crazy!

218
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,953
Listen. Real Americans!

219
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:30,051
Pound-for-pound, sugar ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter ever to live.

220
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,916
Come on, man. What about Joe Louis?

221
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:36,000
The brown bomber.
Now, that was a great boxer.

222
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,130
You damn right.

223
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,213
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay?

224
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,140
Got a point.
Cassius Clay was a bad motherfucker.

225
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,717
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

226
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,394
I'm just saying
I stopped liking Cassius Clay

227
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,793
once he changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
What kind of shit is that?

228
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,103
Wait a second. Wait a second.

229
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:57,439
A man has a right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.

230
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:02,994
If a man wants to be called Muhammad Ali,
goddamn it, this is a free country.

231
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,039
You should respect his wishes,
and call the man Muhammad Ali.

232
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,242
His mama named him Clay,
I'ma call him Clay.

233
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,917
That's right.

234
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,541
- I say Clay.
- Get outta here.

235
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,666
That's right.
He gonna always be Clay to me.

236
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,279
I don't give a fuck
what he changed his name to.

237
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,009
He is Clay. He Clay to me. I say Clay.

238
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,555
Then you're a putz, the three of you.
Three putzes.

239
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:28,386
You should change the name outside
from my-t-sharp to the three putzes.

240
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,153
Okay, now what the fuck do you want?

241
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,700
We desire a room.

242
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,322
You better not be wasting my time.
You got money?

243
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,500
Come on in, gentlemen.

244
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,293
Yo, man, get the big bag. Yeah.

245
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,011
Excuse me if I was brusque.

246
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,591
Sometimes we get boo-boos in here
without a dollar to their name.

247
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,974
Obviously, you gentlemen came in
on another boat.

248
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,268
We seek meager accommodations.

249
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,815
Excuse me?

250
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,565
We require a room that is very poor.

251
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,367
Hey, stu! Your rent's due, motherfucker!

252
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,162
Don't be pulling that
falling-down-the-stairs shit on me!

253
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,956
You hear? Are you conscious? Shoot.

254
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,253
Every month, the same damn thing.
I'm telling you the truth.

255
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,895
All right, here we are.

256
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,727
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you're going to have to share it.

257
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,197
We got a little bit of an insect problem,
but you boys from Africa are used to that.

258
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,202
And another thing, don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.

259
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,628
This is the place I was telling you about.
It's real fucked up.

260
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:24,009
Got just one window facing a brick wall.
Used to rent it to a blind man.

261
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,312
Damn shame what they did to that dog.

262
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,562
We will take the room.

263
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,856
Yes.

264
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,501
Behold, semmi. Life. Real life.

265
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,133
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.

266
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,262
Good morning, my neighbors!

267
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,843
Hey, fuck you!

268
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,519
Yes, yes!

269
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,143
Fuck you, too!

270
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,986
Mighty fine.

271
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,446
Yeah...

272
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,867
- Come to my house!
- Hey, wait up!

273
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,999
I'm beginning to suspect these are
the people that have stolen our luggage.

274
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,844
Yo, you wanna buy some toothbrushes, man?

275
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,466
This is some fly personal hygiene
equipment I got here, man.

276
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,039
And I've got a hell of hair dryer
over here, too. Check it out.

277
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,269
Thief!

278
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,847
Stop, thief! Come back! Thief!

279
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,181
Semmi, let him go.

280
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,891
But those things belong to us.

281
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,854
We're well rid of those material things.
Let them wear our princely robes.

282
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,695
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as new yorkers.

283
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,332
I feel like a complete idiot.

284
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,034
Oh, do not be ridiculous.

285
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:29,047
You can be all the things you've...
Always wanted fo be.

286
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,340
Beautiful. Sexy.
It's easy as one, two, three.

287
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,926
Just let your soul glow

288
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,138
just let it shine through

289
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,567
just let your soul glow, baby

290
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,191
feel it oh, so silky smooth

291
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,694
just let it shine through

292
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:56,870
just let your soul glow

293
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,413
soul glo.

294
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,625
Perhaps I should cut off my prince's lock.

295
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,748
No! Yes.

296
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,830
You must be outta your goddamn mind!

297
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,725
Joe Louis was the greatest boxer
to ever live!

298
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,196
I'll be with you boys in a minute.

299
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,711
He was badder than Cassius Clay,
he badder than sugar ray.

300
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,342
He badder than... who's that new boy?

301
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,473
- Mike Tyson.
- Mike Tyson.

302
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,237
Look like a bulldog.
He badder than him too.

303
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,790
He would've whooped Mike Tyson's ass,
he whoop all their asses!

304
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,683
What about rocky marciano?

305
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,431
Oh, there they go! There they go!

306
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,063
Every time I start talking about boxing,

307
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,520
a white man got to pull rocky marciano
out their ass!

308
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,027
That's they one! That's they one!
Rocky marciano! Rocky marciano!

309
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,074
Let me tell you something
once and for all!

310
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:39,030
Rocky marciano was good, but compared
to Joe Louis, rocky marciano ain't shit!

311
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,415
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

312
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,683
That's right, he did whoop Joe Louis' ass.

313
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,370
Joe Louis was 75 years old
when they fought!

314
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,610
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.

315
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,501
Joe Louis had come out of retirement
to fight rocky marciano.

316
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,927
The man was 76 years old!

317
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,926
Joe Louis always lied about his age.
He lied about his age all the time.

318
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,303
One time, frank Sinatra came
and sat in this chair.

319
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,038
I said, "frank,
you hang out with Joe Louis.

320
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,874
Just between me and you:
How old is Joe Louis?"

321
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,015
You know what frank told me?
He said, "Joe Louis is 137 years old."

322
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,645
A hundred and thirty-seven years old.

323
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,228
Oh, man, you never meet no frank Sinatra.

324
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,441
Fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you!
Who's next?

325
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,690
Goddamn, boy, what's that?
Some kind of a weave or something?

326
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,797
It is my natural hair.
I have been growing it since birth.

327
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,758
Shit. What kind of chemical
you got in there?

328
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,713
I have put no chemicals,
only juices and berries.

329
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,007
Shit, that ain't nothing but ultra perm.
Tell me, how do you want me to cut this?

330
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,725
Just make it nice and neat.

331
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,694
That'll be $8.

332
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:10,287
Tell me, semmi, honestly, how do I look?

333
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,466
I think it is time to find your queen.

334
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,453
I've got a secret.

335
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,915
I worship the devil.

336
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,002
See, that's the problem.

337
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,635
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.

338
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:06,389
Now, some guys go an hour,
hour and a half, that's it.

339
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,017
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.

340
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,185
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a BMW.

341
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,942
Yeah, well, you know, baby,
I'm almost single.

342
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,864
My husband's on death row.

343
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,235
This is the first date
Theresa and I have been on

344
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,195
since the doctor separated us.

345
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,995
I'm into the group thing.

346
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,463
I was Joan of arc in my former life.

347
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,587
My name is peaches and I'm the best

348
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,469
all the DJs want fo feel my breasts

349
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,353
I wanna work on videos, but really
I wanna be my own star in the videos.

350
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,277
Because I wanna become a pop singer,
and a rock singer,

351
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,650
and write my own songs,
produce my own songs.

352
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,277
And then I'm gonna try an actress.

353
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,826
People tell me how talented I am.
"I'm a natural." And stuff like that.

354
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,778
So, then I'm gonna write my own stories,

355
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,081
direct my own stories, and produce
my own movies that I'm doing...

356
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,847
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.

357
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,137
But I've been watching you all evening.

358
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,220
And I wanna tear you apart.

359
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,932
And your friend, too.

360
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,646
Is it my imagination

361
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,574
or does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?

362
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,535
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

363
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,493
Mr. Clarence.

364
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,622
Hey! The boys from Africa!
How y'all doing this evening?

365
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,921
Sir, where can one go
to find nice women here?

366
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,529
Oh, you got to get out and look.
They ain't gonna just fall in your lap.

367
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,669
We have been to every bar in queens.

368
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,824
That's where you messed up.

369
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,713
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.

370
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,208
You got to go to a nice place,
a quiet place, like a library.

371
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,306
The good women in there.
And... church is good girls.

372
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,603
Or this place here.

373
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,726
Where I'm going tonight,
the black awareness rally.

374
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,684
There gonna be fine women there.
Good, clean girls.

375
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,685
That's where I'm going. Shit.

376
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,610
I didn't come here to preach to you today.

377
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,371
But, you know,
when I look at these contestants

378
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,877
for the miss black awareness pageant,

379
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,628
I feel good.

380
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,552
I feel good 'cause I know there's a god.

381
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,051
Somewhere. There's a god somewhere.

382
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,882
Turn around, ladies, for me, please.

383
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,104
You know there's a god
who sits on high and looks down low.

384
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,103
Man cannot make it like this.

385
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,561
Larry flynt, Hugh Hefner,
they can take the picture,

386
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,111
but they can't make it.

387
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,283
Only god above, the Hugh Hefner on high,
can make it for you.

388
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,236
Apparently, these are the best women
queens has to offer.

389
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,451
Pick one, and let's go home.

390
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,160
Be patient, my friend.

391
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,707
Do you love him? Do you feel joy? Say joy!

392
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,584
Joy!

393
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,335
A

394
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,586
Joy!

395
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,588
Can I get an amen?

396
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,762
- Amen!
- Amen, brother!

397
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,807
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

398
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,885
Yes, lord!

399
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,517
Only god can give that woman
the kind of joy she has right there.

400
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,519
Amen!

401
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,896
Make a joyful noise unto the lord!

402
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,022
Joy!

403
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,354
I am very happy to be here!

404
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,065
- Amen!
- Amen!

405
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,526
Yes, sir. Can I get an amen?

406
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,828
Amen! Yes!

407
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,156
I don't know what you come to do, but...

408
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,708
Come to praise his name.

409
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,454
Lord.

410
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,339
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.

411
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,296
There's a god somewhere.

412
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,634
I got a special treat for you
this evening.

413
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,813
A young man that you all know
as Joe the policeman

414
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,688
from the "what's going down"
episode of that's my mama.

415
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,863
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.

416
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,068
A big round of applause
for Jackson height's own,

417
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,118
Mr. Randy Watson!

418
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,743
Yes, Randy Watson!

419
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,457
That boy is good.

420
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,043
Good and terrible.

421
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,962
And reverend brown.

422
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,820
Can we hear it for the reverend?
This man's been my reverend

423
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,005
since I was a little boy,
and I love him dearly.

424
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,836
You're a very special man. Reverend brown.

425
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,674
Reverend brown.

426
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,956
It's so lovely to be here.
What a beautiful audience.

427
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,143
Give yourselves a round of applause.
You're so lovely. Everyone's so lovely.

428
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,727
And while you're in the clapping mood,
give a round of applause to my band,

429
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,152
sexual chocolate.

430
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,316
Sexual chocolate.

431
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,069
They play so fine, don't you agree?

432
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,949
I believe that children are our future

433
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,044
thank you.

434
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,086
Teach them well
and let them lead the way

435
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:30,338
show them all the beauly
they possess inside

436
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,966
give them a sense

437
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,719
of pride make it easier...

438
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,720
Some of the good stuff, right? Coming up.

439
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,971
Want a coke?

440
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,103
Enjoying the show?

441
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,473
Enjoy, young man.

442
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,020
I decided long ago

443
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,777
never to walk in anyone's shadow

444
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,780
if I fail, if I succeed

445
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:03,083
you can't take away my dignity

446
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,625
because the greatest

447
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,121
love of all

448
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,334
inside of me

449
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,713
yeah, yeah

450
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,840
sexual chocolate!

451
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,306
Sexual chocolate!

452
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,347
Goddamn, that boy can sing.

453
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,932
- You must be crazy.
- He good.

454
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,027
You must be crazy.

455
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,703
Put your hands together
for Mr. Randy Watson.

456
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,411
Yeah! One more time, Randy Watson!
How about it?

457
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,546
Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr. Cleo mcdowell

458
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,340
who is responsible
for the fine food and beverages

459
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,838
you've been consuming tonight.

460
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,259
Cleo, I know you proud
of your lovely daughters, we are too.

461
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,717
Please welcome one of the organizers
of tonight's festivities,

462
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,179
miss Lisa mcdowell!
Lisa, come up here, baby girl.

463
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,772
Try to work in a plug
for the new salad bar.

464
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,146
Daddy, I'm not mentioning the restaurant.

465
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,943
Well, at least give them the address.

466
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,702
Girl, you look so good,

467
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,306
somebody ought to put you on a plate,
sop you up with a biscuit.

468
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,956
Thank you.

469
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,038
You know,

470
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,589
black awareness week
is an opportunity for self-expression.

471
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,049
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.

472
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,219
Randy attempted to express himself
through song...

473
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:44,764
In his own unique way,
but the song makes a good point.

474
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,470
The children are our future.

475
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:52,685
It's up to all of us to provide a place
where children can express themselves.

476
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,571
We need to rebuild Lincoln park.

477
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,783
Now, ushers are passing through the aisles
with donation baskets,

478
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,033
so please, give all you can.

479
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,042
Now, we're happy
to get the kind of money that jingles,

480
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,790
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

481
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,077
- Donations. This is donations.
- I thought it was the trash!

482
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,661
- Don't be hitting on me.
- Put some money in there.

483
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,392
- Stupid ass.
- I'll whop your ass, Clarence!

484
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,062
- Tall, black motherfucker.
- There's women up inside here.

485
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,210
- Come on, man.
- I don't give a fuck.

486
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,519
Ain't nobody give me nothing.

487
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,789
Thank you.

488
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,873
She is wonderful.

489
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,087
Akeem...

490
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:59,964
You can see Lisa and Mr. mcdowell
at mcdowell's restaurant,

491
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:07,304
8507 queens boulevard.

492
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,365
All right, fellas.

493
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,969
Now, your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.

494
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,070
Then, I want you to wash all the windows.
Real good, too.

495
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,076
And don't leave no streaks.

496
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,372
What are you doing?

497
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,758
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!

498
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:50,886
Look, me and the McDonald's people,
we got this little misunderstanding.

499
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:58,318
See, they're McDonald's, I'm mcdowell's.

500
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,275
They got the golden arches...

501
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,362
Mine is the golden arcs.

502
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,243
They got the big Mac, I got the big Mick.

503
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,370
We both got two all-beef patties,

504
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,123
special sauce, lettuce,
cheese, pickles and onions,

505
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,921
but they use a sesame seed bun.

506
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,999
My buns have no seeds.

507
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,840
Hey, kid, I got it.

508
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:34,099
Now, you gotta mop the food prep area
twice a day.

509
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,190
You know how to mop?

510
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,311
- Oh, yes, of course.
- All right.

511
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,726
There you go.

512
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,955
Don't use the bucket,
it'll just confuse you.

513
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,173
Now, when you get through here,
you take out the trash.

514
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,260
Yes.

515
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,380
Come with me.
I've got an easy job for you.

516
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,958
Hi!

517
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:40,999
Hello.

518
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,093
Hello!

519
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,263
Hi.

520
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,340
I am akeem.

521
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,552
It's nice to meet you, akeem.

522
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,557
I have recently been placed
in charge of garbage.

523
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,232
Do you have any that requires disposal?

524
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,441
No, it's totally empty.

525
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,824
Well, when it fills up,
don't be afraid to call me.

526
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,993
I'll come take it out most urgently.

527
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,826
That's good to know.

528
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,579
When you think of garbage, think of akeem.

529
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,209
Well...

530
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,923
I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.

531
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:30,720
Maybe we'll have a chance again
to talk on a professional level.

532
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:34,806
Goodbye, akeem.

533
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,421
Just let your soul glow, baby

534
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:16,178
feeling oh, so silky smooth

535
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,510
just let it shine through

536
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:24,645
just let your soul glow

537
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,271
soul glo.

538
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,401
- Darryl!
- Cleo.

539
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,945
You're looking sharp, kid.

540
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,949
How about a Mick shake?
I believe strawberry is your favorite.

541
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,080
Straw.

542
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,085
Lisa is in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.

543
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,170
So, how's everything over at soul glo?

544
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,257
Fine. Our home weave products
are really taking off.

545
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,466
Good.

546
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,849
By the way, dad isn't using
the company tickets to the jets game.

547
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,804
And I thought you might enjoy them.

548
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,183
Darryl, that's very considerate of you.
Thank you.

549
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,563
Lisa. Look who's here, honey.

550
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,658
Hi.

551
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,025
You two kids have a good time, you hear?

552
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,832
- Ready?
- Sure.

553
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,751
Listen, I want to ask you something.

554
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:28,608
The other day at the rally,

555
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,250
somebody stuffed a large amount of cash
into one of the collection boxes.

556
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,802
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?

557
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:39,973
Well, I...

558
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,305
I thought it was you!

559
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,188
You know me. Anything for the kids.

560
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,984
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

561
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,738
Oh, before I forget, I got us
four tickets to the St. John's game.

562
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,993
- Maybe your sister will bring somebody.
- Great.

563
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,995
Hey, take care of this, will you?

564
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,475
Excuse me.

565
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,016
Hey! It's kunta kinte!

566
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,685
What can I do for you, boy?

567
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,566
Can you make my hair look like this?

568
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,194
What you want make your hair
look like that for?

569
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,638
I like the way you wear your hair,
natural. That's good, man.

570
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,448
I wish more of the young children today

571
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,659
would wear their hair
like Dr. Martin Luther King did.

572
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,663
You ain't never seen
Dr. Martin Luther King

573
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,020
with no messy jheri curl on his head.

574
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,159
Ain't that right? Amen.

575
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,731
Dr. king ain't come
walking around like that.

576
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,666
You know, I met
Dr. Martin Luther King once.

577
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,169
You lying. You ain't never met
Dr. Martin Luther King.

578
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,377
Yes, I met Dr. Martin Luther King in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.

579
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,383
I was walking down the street,
minding my own business, just walking.

580
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,181
I walk around the corner,
man walk up, hit me in my chest.

581
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,261
I fall on the ground,
look up, it's Dr. Martin Luther King.

582
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:09,042
I said, "Dr. king!" He said, "oops,
I thought you were somebody else."

583
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,648
Oh, man. You lying.
You never met Martin Luther the king.

584
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,421
- Knocked the wind outta me.
- No, he didn't.

585
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,481
- Yes, he did.
- No, he did not!

586
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,529
Why you so worried about how you look?

587
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,608
I am trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.

588
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,612
I ain't never heard no woman
giving no man no loving

589
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,747
'cause his hair look good.

590
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,997
That's right.

591
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,541
Is this an American girl? Yes.

592
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,792
You got to go through her papa.
That's a big misconception.

593
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,443
People don't know that
about American women.

594
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,362
Ain't got nothing to do
with your hair or your pocket.

595
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,344
Get in good with American woman's father,
you in good with her.

596
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,871
- Ain't that right?
- He ain't lying.

597
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,390
That's right. Get in good with the father,
you home free.

598
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,058
Home free.

599
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,727
Like a bird.

600
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,113
Mr. mcdowell.

601
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,951
What is it?

602
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,532
Sir, I was wondering,
did you happen to catch

603
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,943
the professional football contest
on television last night?

604
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,578
No, I didn't.

605
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,409
Oh, it was most exhilarating.

606
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:15,621
The giants of New York took on
the packers of green bay.

607
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,547
In the end, the giants triumphed

608
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,798
by kicking an oblong ball
made of pigskin through a big h.

609
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,004
It was a most ripping victory.

610
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,429
Son, I'm just going to tell you
this one time.

611
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,555
Yes?

612
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,937
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.

613
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,436
Yes.

614
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:46,695
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here, rich guys get all the chicks.

615
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,788
Yes, he must work very hard.

616
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,666
The prince of soul glo work hard?

617
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,920
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.

618
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,294
He could buy her anything he wants.

619
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,921
How are you gonna compete with that?

620
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,533
I'll get it!

621
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,089
Delivery for miss Lisa mcdowell.

622
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,761
I'll take it. I'm her sister.

623
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,214
Would you sign here, please?

624
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,895
What is it?

625
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,689
Something for you.

626
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,361
Do you mind if I open it?

627
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,114
You think they're real?

628
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,490
They couldn't be.

629
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,248
From an admirer. Not Darryl.

630
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,583
Somebody is messing around.

631
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,084
I am not.

632
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,334
I don't care how much a man admires you,

633
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,189
he's not going to give you
earrings like that

634
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,338
unless you're giving him a little boo-tay!

635
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,970
Not everybody thinks like you, patrice.

636
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,393
Yes, they do. They just don't admit it.

637
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,577
Do you realize I have not had sex
since we got to America?

638
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,742
Semmi, look. There she is.

639
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,413
I am going to talk to her.

640
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:06,217
Good. Tell her you sent
the $500,000 pair of earrings.

641
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,262
Then she will fall into your arms,
and we can leave this godforsaken place.

642
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,634
Oh, no, I cannot do that.

643
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,216
- Do something.
- Do not worry, I have a plan.

644
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,519
What are you going to do?
Mop your way into her heart?

645
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:18,766
That is not fair.

646
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,223
What's not fair is me doing manual labor.

647
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,776
I am badly in need of a manicure.

648
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,401
Listen to you.
"I am badly in need of a manicure."

649
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,366
Are you going to say something?

650
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,998
Hey, akeem.

651
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,916
- Yes.
- This is my sister, patrice.

652
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,459
- Hello! How are you?
- Hi.

653
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:42,912
Akeem is from Africa.

654
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,792
Whatcha doin' in New York?

655
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,425
I'm a student.

656
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,670
What school are you going to?

657
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,133
I go to the university.

658
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,224
Which one?

659
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,845
The university of the United States.

660
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,730
I never heard of that.

661
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,568
Well, it is a small university.
We do not even have a basketball team.

662
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:10,773
Really? We got an extra ticket for
the St. John's game tomorrow. Wanna come?

663
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,281
Yes.

664
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,704
Good. You can double date
with me and Darryl.

665
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,137
Yeah!

666
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,849
Put it! Yeah! Yes! Yes!

667
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,400
In his face! In his face!

668
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,352
Yes! In the face!

669
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,284
Why don't you take off your jacket, akeem?

670
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,659
Put it in the face, right? I like this.

671
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,866
Isn't that better?

672
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,872
Yes. Thank you very much.

673
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,219
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.

674
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,591
Are you able to follow the game, akeem?

675
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,891
Oh, yes!

676
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,061
I am following the game quite well.

677
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,648
What kind of games do y'all play
in Africa?

678
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,768
Chase the monkey?

679
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,569
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer!

680
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,651
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, right. Soccer.

681
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,656
That's a real cute sport...

682
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,989
Especially the way y'all
bounce that ball off your heads.

683
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,618
Personally, I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.

684
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,834
Yes! Yes!

685
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,481
What are you doing?
It's just the halftime.

686
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,139
Yes, this is my favorite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment, please?

687
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,309
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

688
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:21,411
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!

689
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,828
I cannot believe it!

690
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,878
Greetings, your highness. Greetings.

691
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,796
Please, please, stop bowing.

692
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,044
I am a loyal citizen of zamunda.

693
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,172
But you're going to spill your beverages.

694
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:40,472
This is the greatest day of my life.

695
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,218
Yes. It was very nice meeting you foo.
Excuse me.

696
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,024
Please! Please!

697
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,693
Please. May I just have my picture
taken with you?

698
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,834
I will Cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.

699
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,919
Thank you. The rest of my life.

700
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:22,847
Who was that?

701
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,385
Just a man I met in the restroom.

702
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,103
Sweetheart, why don't you quit this job?

703
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,154
Because I like it here.

704
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,606
Yeah. But you're my lady.

705
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,408
My lady doesn't have to work.

706
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,782
I'll take care of you.

707
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,285
I'll get you anything you want.

708
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,415
What can I get you?

709
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,455
Nothing.

710
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,548
I'll get you some... coffee.

711
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,464
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

712
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,684
Hey, akeem,
did you have a good time at the game?

713
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,264
Yes, I did. Thank you.

714
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:16,022
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
Sometimes he can be pretty obnoxious.

715
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,899
Well, he cannot help it.

716
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,272
Sit down. Take a break for a minute.

717
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,402
Thank you.

718
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,491
You know, you're a very unusual guy.

719
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,789
I've never seen anybody take so much pride
in mopping a floor.

720
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,286
"He who would learn to fly one day
must first learn to stand and walk."

721
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,746
One cannot fly into flying.

722
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,041
That is not mine. That is Nietzsche's.

723
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,136
See, that's what I mean.

724
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,212
Most of the guys who work here
don't go around quoting Nietzsche.

725
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,686
All right! Everybody shut up
and do like I say!

726
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:52,808
Get the money out!

727
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,686
Stay cool! Nobody gets hurt!

728
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,397
Take the money out! All of it!

729
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,192
Don't stall me, fat boy! Let's go!

730
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:07,365
Come on! You're wasting my time!
Come on! Come on, come on. Come on!

731
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,616
Anybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

732
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,576
What are you looking at, buddy?

733
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,753
Come on! Stop stalling!

734
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,464
Come on! Don't stall me! All of it!

735
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,680
Come on. Come on!

736
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,723
Excuse me for a moment.

737
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,361
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.

738
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,784
Who the fuck is this asshole?

739
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,450
Please refrain from using
any further obscenities

740
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,997
in the presence of these people.

741
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,119
What?

742
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,998
I've warned you.
Ll be forced to thrash you.

743
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,669
Fuck you!

744
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,129
Freeze, you diseased rhinoceros pizzle.

745
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,982
Hey, fellas. I gotta tell ya,

746
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,155
I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.

747
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,109
You know, we've been hit
by that guy five times.

748
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:33,072
I got a feeling he won't be coming back,
thanks to my... African connection.

749
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,829
Say, leave Sunday night open.

750
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,206
I'm having a little get-together
at my house.

751
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,584
You see? It is working.
He has accepted us as equals.

752
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,171
Okay, fellas, just give them a ticket,

753
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,882
take their keys,
park the cars down the street.

754
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:55,014
When you're finished,
come inside and help in the kitchen.

755
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,266
Akeem, I want you to come with me.

756
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,939
I want to show you the inside
of mcdowell's little castle.

757
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:10,443
Well, this, this here is my showplace.
I think it pretty much speaks for itself.

758
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,365
You know something, akeem?

759
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,496
When I was growing up,

760
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,825
nine of us lived in a shack
no bigger than this room.

761
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,244
And look what I have today.

762
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,256
Only wish Mrs. mcdowell
could have lived to see it.

763
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,338
You have a fine house, sir.

764
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,590
Oh, well, thank you.

765
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,598
You know, in 20 or 30 years,
with hard work,

766
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,926
maybe you can have
a place like this for yourself.

767
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,897
That would be something.

768
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,099
Wouldn't it?

769
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,071
Well, this is where
you're gonna be working tonight.

770
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,116
Ever open a champagne bottle?

771
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,543
I have seen it done before.

772
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,087
Good.
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

773
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,757
I better get dressed for this party.

774
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,711
Look around, make yourself comfortable
till the guests arrive.

775
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,972
You see, I love the lord.
You understand what I'm saying?

776
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,644
I love the lord.

777
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:23,724
And if loving the lord is wrong,
I don't wanna be right.

778
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,651
Hi, Mike. Good to see ya.
Glad you could make it.

779
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,571
Enjoy. Drink up.
Ots more where that came from.

780
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,490
Hey, Randy, how's everything, buddy?
Good to see you.

781
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,096
Watch out for this guy.
Yo. Brother Cleo?

782
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,951
Big ed! My man!

783
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:37,908
You know...

784
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,408
I can appreciate the way you
handled that dude with the gun.

785
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,043
I would have helped you out myself,
except...

786
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,404
Well, I had a cup of coffee
in my hand. You understand, right?

787
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:52,093
I bet you learned all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.

788
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,928
Yes. Where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.

789
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:01,807
I'm all for that. Especially with women.

790
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:07,188
You know, they may not admit it,
but they all want a man to...

791
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,277
Take charge.

792
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,238
Tell them what to do.

793
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,212
That's one of the things
I wanted to talk to you...

794
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:32,918
Darryl, I must tell you, your mother
gets lovelier every time I see her.

795
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:36,008
Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone
for a minute.

796
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,215
Sure, Darryl. Excuse us.

797
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,015
Mom, dad, grandma.

798
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,593
Sure, son.

799
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,568
Actually, I like the fries
better at McDonald's,

800
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,143
but I'd never tell Mr. mcdowell that.

801
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,270
Akeem, make sure
everybody's glass is kept full.

802
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,525
We're about to make
a very special announcement.

803
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,651
Yes, sir.

804
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,030
May I have everyone's attention, please?

805
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,378
Mr. and Mrs. jenks,
would you please join me?

806
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,128
And mother jenks, you come up here, too.

807
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:25,221
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.

808
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,771
Semmi, please.

809
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,350
Champagne.

810
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,275
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

811
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,157
Okay. Go on. Get out of here.

812
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,787
Now, as you all know,

813
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:47,288
Darryl and Lisa have been going together
for quite some time.

814
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,745
I'm pleased to announce
that just a few moments ago,

815
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,671
Darryl here popped the big question...

816
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,667
And Lisa happily accepted.

817
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,430
So as it turns out,
this has become an engagement party.

818
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,145
Amen. Praise the lord.

819
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,357
Married?

820
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,905
To the bride and groom.

821
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,909
To the bride and groom.

822
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,088
I'm gonna pray for you.

823
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:37,292
I want you to hold onto
god's unchanging hand

824
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,879
because he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.

825
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:45,217
Yes. He helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.

826
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:49,680
He helped gilligan
get off the island. Lord.

827
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,765
I want to talk to you now.

828
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:06,279
The next time you and my father
decide to get together to plan my life,

829
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:07,989
I wish you'd let me in on it.

830
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,949
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me.

831
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,835
But, baby, it's our engagement party.

832
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,101
Thanks.

833
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,900
Would you like some champagne?

834
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:40,071
No, thanks.
I really don't feel like celebrating.

835
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,487
Wait.

836
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,202
Sit down and keep me company.

837
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,836
If you're going to hang out with me,
you gotta loosen up, akeem.

838
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,796
Oh, I can be loose.

839
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:02,763
See?

840
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,137
Much better.

841
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:08,804
Are you all right?

842
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:10,896
I'm fine.

843
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,770
I'm not gonna be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl or my father or anybody.

844
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,355
I understand completely.

845
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,277
In my country,
they arrange many marriages.

846
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:23,198
And I don't feel anyone should
get married out of obligation.

847
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,364
You're right.

848
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,410
How could I have even considered
marrying a guy like Darryl?

849
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,868
I wondered the same thing.

850
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,415
He just made me so furious back there.

851
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,702
You don't think I overreacted, do you?

852
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,089
The first reaction
is usually the correct one.

853
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,714
You know, you're very easy to talk to.

854
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,261
I feel like I could tell you anything.

855
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,729
Hey, akeem, we need some more
champagne over here.

856
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,694
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.

857
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:05,273
Well, thanks for listening to me, akeem.
I really appreciate it.

858
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,653
Anytime, Lisa mcdowell.

859
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,163
Hey, be careful.

860
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,079
I think my sister likes you.

861
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,135
Semmi.

862
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,521
Semmi.

863
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,610
Come now, my friend,
you're going to be late for work.

864
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,067
So what if I am?

865
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,117
Semmi, we cannot afford
to anger Mr. mcdowell now.

866
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,740
Especially since things
are going so well with Lisa.

867
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,413
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.

868
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,579
Yes, you are going to work today.

869
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,755
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.

870
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,128
You want to live better? Fine.

871
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:09,129
Fix this place up.
But you are going to work today.

872
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,353
- Hello!
- Hi.

873
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:25,733
You know, I started on cleanup
just like you guys,

874
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,860
but now, see, I'm washing lettuce.

875
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,658
Soon I'll be on fries, then the grill.

876
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:35,534
A year or two, I make assistant manager.

877
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,412
And that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.

878
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,743
Just two years?

879
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,588
Maybe I stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.

880
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,679
You know what I mean?

881
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,006
You must be tired of hearing
about my problems with Darryl.

882
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,136
No. No, not at all.

883
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,391
You know, I feel like I owe you a favor.

884
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,682
Why don't you come to my house,
and I'll fix you dinner.

885
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,350
Patrice will be there.

886
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,026
Let us go to my house.

887
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,113
Why?

888
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,563
Well, I'd like to cook for you.

889
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,698
You? Cook?

890
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,992
I dabble a little, yes.

891
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,536
Great. Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.

892
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:19,035
Fine. But I have to warn you,

893
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,707
my home is very poor.

894
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,579
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.

895
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,974
Welcome to my humble abode.

896
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:48,398
This is 2-1-2...

897
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,649
Akeem!

898
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:52,242
What's wrong?

899
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,366
Nothing's wrong.

900
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,282
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.

901
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,793
What have you done?

902
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,712
You told me to fix up the place.

903
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,333
I should kill you. 'Why?

904
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,420
I'm supposed to be a poor man.

905
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:16,597
Akeem? Akeem?

906
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,353
Is everything all right?

907
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:23,100
Everything is fine.
Excuse me. I have to tidy up.

908
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,566
Hey, do you smoke?

909
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,575
Take care of your lungs.
They're only human.

910
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,826
What are you doing?

911
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,125
For god's sake, akeem,
do not take my pocket money.

912
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,129
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.

913
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,305
You are being unreasonable.

914
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,553
If you have ruined my chances with Lisa,
I will never forgive you.

915
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,893
I am very sorry.

916
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,149
- Can we go in now?
- Oh, no, we cannot.

917
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,231
Why not?

918
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,783
There is a rat, a big rat inside.

919
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,783
You know what I think?
I think there is no rat.

920
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,910
I think you're just so ashamed
of your apartment,

921
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,741
you can't even let me see it.

922
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,920
Once again, you have judged correctly.

923
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:34,209
If it bothers you that much,
we can go out to eat.

924
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,756
That would be much better.

925
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,200
Excuse me for a moment, please.

926
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,420
What did you give him?

927
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,342
Oh, I just gave him some pocket change.

928
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,685
Randolph.

929
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,611
Leave me alone, Mortimer.

930
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,655
Randolph! Randolph!

931
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,490
I'm still not talking to you.

932
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,578
Look.

933
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,252
Mortimer... we're back.

934
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:57,792
Yeah.

935
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,544
To America.

936
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,051
Why'd you come here?

937
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,515
To find something special.

938
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,931
It's an awfully long way to travel.

939
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,643
No journey is too great
when one finds what he seeks.

940
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,189
Does everyone in Africa talk like you?

941
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,773
Why? Do you not like it?

942
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,075
No, I love it.

943
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,824
It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.

944
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,411
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!

945
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:31,868
Let's have lunch.

946
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,874
You have the most amazing effect
on people.

947
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:40,637
No, I don't.

948
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,838
It's true. Look at that guy
at the basketball game the other day.

949
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,549
People love you.

950
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:49,556
I bet where you're from,

951
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,184
women practically throw themselves
at your feet.

952
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,560
Why do you say that?

953
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:58,561
Because you have
a kind of inner glow, like...

954
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:00,859
You're above anything petty.

955
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,399
It's almost regal.

956
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,162
So what did you do back home?

957
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:14,085
Back home I was... I...
I was in the family business back home.

958
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,003
What's that?

959
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,831
Goat herding.

960
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,875
- Yes, yes.
- Really?

961
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,335
Yes. Does this surprise you?

962
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:26,301
No. It's just that you seem so educated.

963
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,509
Well, the life of a goat herder
is not that demanding.

964
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,685
Goats pretty much take care of themselves,

965
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:35,105
which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.

966
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,102
Please let me.

967
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,733
That's not right. I should pay.

968
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,321
Akeem, I wish you'd stop worrying
about being poor.

969
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,119
If I wanted a wealthy guy,
I'd be with Darryl...

970
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:51,781
Not you.

971
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,338
Would you like to dance?

972
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,634
Yes.

973
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,162
What about patrice?

974
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,373
I am not interested in patrice.

975
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,878
What about Darryl?

976
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,956
I am not interested in Darryl, either.

977
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,743
You actually want to send this?

978
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,570
Why? What is wrong?

979
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:15,708
Read it to me.

980
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:22,376
"To his majesty king jaffe joffer,
the royal palace, zamunda.

981
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:26,675
Sire, akeem and I have depleted our funds.

982
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:30,880
Kindly send 300,000
American dollars immediately

983
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,216
as we are in dire straits.

984
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,471
Your humble servant, semi."

985
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:38,053
- Semmi.
- Semmi.

986
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,264
Should I make it 400,000?

987
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,099
You think that'd be enough?

988
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,853
You are right. 500,000.

989
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:50,115
As long as you're asking,
why don't we go for a cool million.

990
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,942
You do not think that would be too much?

991
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,616
Nah.

992
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,915
Okay. What's going on?

993
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:05,463
Patrice.

994
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,627
I came to see akeem.

995
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,421
What are you two involved in?

996
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:15,007
You can't afford all this stuff
on your salary.

997
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,849
Someone fo kiss

998
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,352
someone fo miss

999
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,979
when you're away

1000
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,606
through here gone each day

1001
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:29,154
to be loved, to be loved

1002
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,277
wow! What a feeling

1003
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,904
to be loved...

1004
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,931
Hey! Keep quiet down there!
People are trying to sleep!

1005
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,571
Some wish to be a king or a queen

1006
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,907
some wish for fortune and fame

1007
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,002
shut up!

1008
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,372
But to be truly

1009
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,921
truly, truly, truly loved

1010
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:49,592
is more than all of these things

1011
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,168
whoa

1012
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,470
- shut up!
- Someone fo care

1013
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,888
someone fo share...

1014
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,411
Where you think you are? Carnegie hall?

1015
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:00,519
- Lonely hours and moments of despair...
- Shut up!

1016
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:04,190
- To be loved, fo be loved...
- Will you shut the fuck up?

1017
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,814
Wow, what a feeling fo be...

1018
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,146
Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...

1019
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:17,240
Oh, hi, akeem. Semmi told me everything.

1020
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:22,538
Sorry things didn't work out
between you and me, but you understand.

1021
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:24,789
Good night...

1022
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,246
Sweet prince.

1023
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,343
Remember, you must not tell a soul.

1024
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,971
Your secret is safe with me,
your highness.

1025
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:42,772
Bye.

1026
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:53,697
If you're the prince, then who am 1?

1027
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:57,951
My servant?

1028
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,548
Boy, they smell good.

1029
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,628
That Darryl must be spending
a fortune on flowers.

1030
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:16,882
Stay out of this, dad.

1031
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,225
Where you going?

1032
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,510
To a museum with akeem.

1033
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,890
No, I don't like that.
I don't like that one bit.

1034
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:26,855
What's wrong with akeem?

1035
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,901
Lisa, you told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.

1036
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,395
Why don't you marry Darryl?

1037
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,195
He dresses real nice,
treats you real good.

1038
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,868
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

1039
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,162
Lisa, I just don't want you to have
to struggle the way your mother and I did.

1040
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:47,580
I know.

1041
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,047
Bye, daddy.

1042
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,425
Bye.

1043
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,722
Come in.

1044
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,346
You boys wanted to see me?

1045
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:06,304
Yes, Mr. townsend,
we would like to change apartments.

1046
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:10,853
Goddamn! What the hell
have you boys done in here?

1047
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,651
My friend, semmi,
has altered the apartment

1048
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,604
and we would like
to exchange it for another.

1049
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,485
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

1050
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:18,907
Oh, of course not, sir.

1051
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,485
It's just that
I'm going to bring a young lady up,

1052
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,787
and I cannot let her
see me living like this.

1053
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,865
I'll tell you what,

1054
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,451
I'm gonna let you boys
stay in my apartment,

1055
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,877
and I'll move up here.

1056
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,296
Does your apartment look poor?

1057
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,920
Yeah, it's a real shit-hole.
You'll love it.

1058
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,470
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1A.

1059
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,015
Downstairs, first floor.

1060
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:47,970
Thank you. You are too kind.
Semmi, move our things.

1061
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:59,319
I have a date with Lisa!
Isn't that wonderful?

1062
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,811
Who in the hell is that?

1063
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:32,912
Hey, what's up, brother?

1064
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,723
You a little late
for the Christmas pageant.

1065
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,761
I'm king jaffe joffer, ruler of zamunda.

1066
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,304
Yeah, well, have a seat.

1067
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,071
Chair number two
will be ready in a second.

1068
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:55,314
This is beautiful. What is that? Velvet?

1069
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,693
I have come for my son, akeem.

1070
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,020
Come for who?

1071
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:04,732
You know, kunta from up... kunta.

1072
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,532
Oh, yeah, the boy upstairs.

1073
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,744
Oh, yeah, yeah, him.
He around here someplace.

1074
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,271
He live upstairs on the fifth floor.

1075
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:16,665
Hey! Who gonna clean up all these flowers?

1076
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,804
You may enter.

1077
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:36,809
You are not akeem.

1078
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,399
I know that.

1079
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,113
What is this?

1080
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,328
A photograph.

1081
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,622
What is this mcdowell's?

1082
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,625
It's a place over on queens boulevard.
I think he works there.

1083
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,329
My son works?

1084
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,457
Where is he now?

1085
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:07,921
I don't know.
He moved downstairs, apartment 1A.

1086
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,559
Your majesty. What are you doing here?

1087
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:25,862
I received your telegram. Where is akeem?

1088
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,033
He went out.

1089
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,074
So, how was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust?

1090
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:35,998
Your only job was to look after akeem.
How could you let him come to such a pass?

1091
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,623
Akeem will not listen to me.
He's gone quite mad, your majesty.

1092
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:42,830
Semmi...

1093
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:47,426
You have disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.

1094
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:52,138
You will confine yourself
to our royal suite

1095
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,510
at the Waldorf-astoria.

1096
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:57,052
And see that he puts on
some decent attire.

1097
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,062
And I want you to bathe him thoroughly.

1098
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,521
Oh, thank you, your majesty!

1099
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,527
Look, zamunda.
That's where you're from, isn't it?

1100
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,578
Yes. What's it like?

1101
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:18,452
You would love it there.
It's the most beautiful place on earth.

1102
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:24,413
The people are very friendly, and you,
you, they would treat like a queen.

1103
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:28,842
Akeem.

1104
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,628
People are gonna see us.

1105
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:34,715
Then let them see.

1106
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,516
Lisa, let us go.

1107
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,229
- Now?
- Yes. Right now.

1108
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:01,875
Yeah, well, look, Darryl,
why don't you come by the house tonight?

1109
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,372
Yeah, about nine o'clock.

1110
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:06,121
Lisa will be home by then.

1111
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,175
Yeah, look. Don't worry about it, buddy.
We'll work something out.

1112
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,840
Okay, see you later.

1113
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:20,722
Mr. mcdowell?

1114
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:21,814
Yeah?

1115
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,763
There's some people here to see you.

1116
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:27,643
They're not from McDonald's, are they?

1117
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:28,897
I don't think so.

1118
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:36,951
What can I do for you?

1119
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,493
Oha.

1120
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:44,247
This is king jaffe joffer,
ruler of zamunda.

1121
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:46,293
He is searching for his son, akeem.

1122
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:48,716
Your son?

1123
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,506
Yes, my son the prince.

1124
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,960
A prince? Are you serious?

1125
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,012
Prince akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of zamunda.

1126
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:59,348
I always knew there was
something special about that boy.

1127
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,222
Can you tell us where he might be?

1128
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:04,555
Yes, he's out
with my lovely daughter, Lisa.

1129
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,477
I'm staying at the Waldorf-astoria.
When you see him, call me.

1130
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:11,652
I'll tell him you're here.

1131
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,980
No.

1132
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:16,783
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.

1133
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:24,825
For your trouble.

1134
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,753
Well, thank you, your royalness.

1135
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:40,807
A prince!

1136
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,664
Walit. What?

1137
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:05,957
We cannot go in.

1138
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,079
Why not?

1139
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:09,707
Wait in the car. I will be right back.

1140
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,846
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.

1141
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,770
It's not that. It's just that
I feel like I'm rushing you.

1142
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:28,062
No, you're not.

1143
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:32,518
It's better if we take our time.

1144
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:33,772
But I want to.

1145
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:35,103
It's better if I take you home.

1146
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:47,287
Look who's here.
Akeem! It's good to see you.

1147
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,747
It is good to see you too, sir.

1148
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,273
Come on inside. Have a little drink.

1149
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,208
I have to get going, Mr. mcdowell.

1150
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:56,791
Oh, no. You got time for one drink.
Have a seat. Get out of here, dog.

1151
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,219
You and I,
we don't spend enough time talking.

1152
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:03,047
Perhaps some other time, sir.
I really have to get going.

1153
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,934
Oh, no. Sit down.
I'll be right back with that drink.

1154
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:26,280
Yeah, king jaffe joffer's room, please.

1155
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:32,286
Yeah, hello, king.
Yeah, Cleo mcdowell here.

1156
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,996
Yeah, king, both the kids are here,
together.

1157
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:40,378
Right. 2432 derby Avenue, Jamaica estates.

1158
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,468
Right. Now, king, I was wondering if...

1159
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:45,177
Hello, king?

1160
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:49,980
I really have to go, sir.

1161
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,477
Oh, no, no. Have a seat. Right here.

1162
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,273
Look, did you want ice in that?

1163
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:57,151
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

1164
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,250
Well, who was that?

1165
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,579
Jehovah's witness.

1166
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,915
Excuse me.

1167
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:23,628
Look, the girl doesn't like you anymore!

1168
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,805
Can't you get that
through your greasy head?

1169
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:27,723
But you told me to come over...

1170
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:32,679
Now, where were we?

1171
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:51,581
I warned you, didn't I? Dottie, get him!

1172
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:04,419
Sir, I really appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.

1173
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:06,550
Oh, no. You can stay a little longer.

1174
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:10,759
I just put some delicious
hors d'oeuvres in the oven... son.

1175
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:13,056
Let me go see if they're ready.

1176
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:19,188
Lisa, I must leave.

1177
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,689
Is something wrong, akeem?

1178
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,576
I promise I will tell you
when the time is right.

1179
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,323
But now, I must go.
Tell your father goodbye for me.

1180
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,242
Where's akeem?

1181
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,448
He said he had to leave.

1182
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:34,783
Well, he can't leave!

1183
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,536
What is going on?

1184
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:40,463
And why are you being so nice to akeem
all of a sudden?

1185
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,923
I like the boy.

1186
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:45,259
What are you up to?

1187
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,382
What? Nothing.

1188
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:50,055
Hey, a man's got a right
to change his mind, doesn't he?

1189
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:51,474
Daddy.

1190
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,594
You know, you two
make a beautiful couple, Lisa.

1191
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,895
Daddy.

1192
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:58,431
He's a real fine young man.

1193
01:34:58,526 --> 01:34:59,526
Dad!

1194
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:04,775
Okay, Lisa, he's rich. He is rich!

1195
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:05,901
What?

1196
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:09,826
He's got his own money, and, baby,
when I tell you he's got his own money,

1197
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,245
I mean the boy has got his own money!

1198
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,502
A prince. He's a prince!

1199
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:30,005
Oh, Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!

1200
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:33,717
Your little goat herder
makes Darryl look like a welfare case.

1201
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:48,659
I will get out here.

1202
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,535
That'll be nine bucks.

1203
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:15,686
Semmi!

1204
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,720
Good news, akeem. We've been rescued.

1205
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:20,649
Where are my parents?

1206
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,974
They've gone to the mcdowells' house
to look for you.

1207
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:25,612
Come with me.

1208
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:27,107
Where we going?

1209
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,234
Back to queens.

1210
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:33,283
Well, look who's here. Come in. Come in.

1211
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:37,075
Welcome to casa de mcdowell's.
Come right in.

1212
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:48,003
Where is akeem?

1213
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:49,966
He just stepped out.

1214
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,046
He probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.

1215
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:58,184
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?

1216
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,353
Oh, very well, thank you.

1217
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:04,183
I don't know whether to shake your hand,
or kiss it, or bow or what?

1218
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,022
I feel like break-dancing.

1219
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:12,486
Come in. Have a seat.
Take a load off. Come on.

1220
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,818
Your son ought to be back in a minute.
Here, sit down.

1221
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,779
Here. Try the la-z-boy.
It's real comfortable.

1222
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:20,741
- It is very nice.
- Yeah. Put your feet up.

1223
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:31,259
Here you go, king.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.

1224
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,553
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.

1225
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:35,220
You told me my son was here.

1226
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:39,426
You know, my daughter, Lisa,
might know where he went.

1227
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,431
Akeem and Lisa have gotten quite close.

1228
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,605
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.

1229
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:48,018
Lisa? There's someone here
to see you, sweetheart.

1230
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:57,736
This is akeem's father, the king.

1231
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:58,910
I eave us.

1232
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,082
I understand you're seeing my son.

1233
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:12,633
I was seeing him.

1234
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,881
Then he must have told you
about his wife in zamunda.

1235
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,132
He's married?

1236
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,762
No, but he will be soon.
We've already chosen his bride.

1237
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:23,936
So you see,
he could not be at all serious about you.

1238
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,555
Akeem came to America to...

1239
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:28,941
Sow his royal oats.

1240
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,812
Excuse me.
I need to be alone for a moment.

1241
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,989
Are you comfortable, miss...

1242
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,735
I'm not sure what to call you?
My name's Cleo.

1243
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:42,743
It is very nice to meet you, Cleo.
My name is aoleon.

1244
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:46,873
A-oleon... a-aleon, a...

1245
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:52,336
Lisa, where you going?
I want you to meet the queen.

1246
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:56,090
Are you all right, my dear?

1247
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,545
I'm sorry...

1248
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,681
I have to get out of here.

1249
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,099
What's the matter, baby?

1250
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,145
Hey, what'd you say to my daughter?

1251
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,813
I told her the truth.
That akeem could not be interested in her.

1252
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,443
How can you be so sure?

1253
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:19,992
Come now.
Our son cannot consort with such a girl.

1254
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:21,319
Hey, now, wait a minute.

1255
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,331
Oha.

1256
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:32,838
I know you have been inconvenienced.
And I am prepared to compensate you.

1257
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,257
Shall we say one million American dollars?

1258
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:37,835
- No way!
- Very well, then. Two million.

1259
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,950
You haven't got enough money
to buy my daughter off.

1260
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:40,974
Nonsense.

1261
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,640
Jaffe, apologize to Mr. mcdowell.

1262
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,013
I will do no such thing.

1263
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,390
The man is beneath me
and so is his daughter.

1264
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:49,143
I don't give a damn who you are!

1265
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:51,144
This is America, Jack.

1266
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,226
Now, you say one more word
about Lisa here,

1267
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:55,357
and I'm gonna break my foot off
in your royal ass!

1268
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,450
Pardon me”?

1269
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,274
What's everybody yelling about?

1270
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,612
Their son, the prince,
is in love with your sister,

1271
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:05,662
but the king here, he can't handle it!

1272
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,332
No he's not.
The prince is in love with me.

1273
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:15,714
Are you all right?

1274
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:16,801
Yes, mother, I am fine.

1275
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,052
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.

1276
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,056
He's the prince.

1277
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,227
Who told you that?

1278
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:37,523
You mean akeem's the prince?

1279
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:40,106
Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.

1280
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:43,489
How come she always gets the good ones?

1281
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,165
Where is Lisa?

1282
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,582
Your daddy here just ran her off.

1283
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,090
What did you tell her?

1284
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:59,087
It is of no consequence.
We shall return to zamunda at once.

1285
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,923
I will not leave without Lisa.

1286
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:03,550
So you do care for her?

1287
01:41:06,686 --> 01:41:09,098
Mother, I love her.

1288
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:11,687
Then go after her.

1289
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,687
Akeem! Akeem, I forbid you!

1290
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:22,114
Put a sock in it, jaffe.
The boy is in love.

1291
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,634
Darryl, what happened?

1292
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,393
Lisa dumped me.

1293
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:57,566
Oh, I know. You poor thing.

1294
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:02,898
First thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.

1295
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:08,448
Stop!

1296
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:10,498
Lisa!

1297
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:12,699
Lisa!

1298
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:19,792
I will be fine by myself.

1299
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:12,759
Lisa, please.

1300
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:16,811
I did not mean to hurt you.

1301
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:20,896
Well, at least I know who gave me these.

1302
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,361
Well, you can keep them
because I don't want them...

1303
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,527
And I don't want you.

1304
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:45,590
Lisa. Lisa.

1305
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:46,838
Look, just leave me alone.

1306
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:48,465
Lisa, please.

1307
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:50,223
I love you.

1308
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,764
What about the woman
you're supposed to marry?

1309
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:55,889
I do not love her.
Why do you think I came to America?

1310
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:59,143
Oh, your father told me,
"to sow your royal oats."

1311
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:02,725
Oh, no. I came to America
to find my bride.

1312
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,902
I came to queens to find you.

1313
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:06,525
So why did you lie to me, then?

1314
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:09,277
Why didn't you just tell me
you were a prince?

1315
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:11,700
Because I wanted you
to love me for who I am.

1316
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,661
I'm not sure who you are.

1317
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:19,038
I'm the man you fell in love with.
Should it matter that I'm a prince?

1318
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:24,414
It shouldn't, but I...

1319
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,716
Just tell me you didn't love me
when you thought I was a goat herder,

1320
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:29,543
and I will never bother you again.

1321
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,349
It just wouldn't work out.
We're too different.

1322
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:42,640
You're royalty, for god's sake.

1323
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:45,359
You want me to renounce my throne? I will.

1324
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:49,906
From this moment on, I renounce my throne!
I'm no longer prince of zamunda!

1325
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:52,358
I renounce my throne!

1326
01:44:56,957 --> 01:44:58,493
Does this make you happy?

1327
01:45:08,594 --> 01:45:10,084
I can't let you do that.

1328
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:13,921
I do not care about my crown.

1329
01:45:15,267 --> 01:45:16,677
All I care about is you.

1330
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:20,181
Marry me, Lisa.

1331
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,272
So, what do you think?

1332
01:45:27,363 --> 01:45:30,105
Go on, honey! Take a chance!

1333
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:45,794
Look. I'm sorry. I can't.

1334
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,542
Goodbye, akeem.

1335
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:59,175
If you're really a prince, I'll marry you.

1336
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:18,462
Look at it this way.

1337
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:20,388
At least we learned
how to make French fries.

1338
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,168
You're still not speaking to me?

1339
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,832
I only want our son to be happy.

1340
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:58,590
And so do I. Aoleon, please.
It is out of our hands.

1341
01:47:58,681 --> 01:47:59,716
The girl told him no.

1342
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:03,174
Well, after the way you treated her,
who could blame her?

1343
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:06,260
Even if she said yes,
they still could not marry.

1344
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:10,146
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

1345
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:12,395
Who am I to change it?

1346
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:15,565
I thought you were the king.

1347
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:40,313
Your highness...

1348
01:49:41,075 --> 01:49:44,613
We have not come to that part yet.

1349
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:55,499
Your highness... your highness...

1350
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:26,692
Would you really have given up
all of this just for me?

1351
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:30,412
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.

1352
01:50:33,502 --> 01:50:35,038
Nah.

1353
01:51:43,822 --> 01:51:46,905
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait. Stop right there.

1354
01:51:46,992 --> 01:51:49,699
Listen. Stop right there a minute.

1355
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:52,744
Man goes into a restaurant...
You listening?

1356
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:55,413
A man goes into a restaurant.

1357
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,456
He sits down. He's having a bowl of soup.

1358
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,377
He says to the waiter,
"waiter, come, taste the soup."

1359
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,192
Waiter says,
"is there something wrong with the soup?"

1360
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:03,456
He says, "taste the soup.”

1361
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,695
He says, "is something wrong
with the soup? Is it too hot?"

1362
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:08,239
He says, "will you taste the soup?"
"What's wrong? Is the soup too cold?"

1363
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:09,878
"Will you just taste the soup?”

1364
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:13,136
"All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?"

1365
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,983
What do you know from funny, you bastard?
