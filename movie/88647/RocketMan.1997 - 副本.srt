1
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,065
双子星号，这里是休斯顿。

2
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,359
是否收到？

3
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,236
收到，休斯顿。

4
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,948
我是指挥官弗雷.兰道尔。

5
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,201
休斯顿，地球看起来非常美丽。

6
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,413
它就像是一个巨大的蓝梅。

7
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,873
休斯顿，收到。

8
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,251
我们已准备好发射制动火箭。

9
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,296
双子星号，可以发射。

10
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,130
制动火箭点火
倒数计时：六秒，

11
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,096
五秒，四秒，三秒，

12
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:40,058
二秒，一秒，点火！

13
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,104
休斯顿，我们有麻烦了。
我们有麻烦了。

14
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,066
控制中心，陀螺仪出现故障！
陀螺仪出现故障！

15
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,195
休斯顿，我们有麻烦了！
我们有麻烦了！

16
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,240
我想要妈妈！
我想要妈妈！

17
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,035
哦-噢。
- 弗雷 Z. 兰道尔

18
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,328
你在干什么呢？

19
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,455
我是为了和平而来。

20
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,832
看哪，乔治。
这是我们的小月球人。

21
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,626
蜜饯菠萝啊！他为什么
不能像别的孩子一样去玩美式足球呢？

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,215
乔治

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,035
<i>休斯顿，
请求着陆。</i>

24
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,872
朝圣者一号，请求着陆。

25
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,791
可以着陆。

26
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,710
朝圣者一号，
你可以进行着陆了。

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>收到，休斯顿。</i>

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,800
Aeroshell deployed.
Deceleration rate, normal. ECLSS is go.

29
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,595
Pilgrim is through
the high gate at 80 percent.

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
Heartbeat steady.
My man is made of ice.

31
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,064
- Bill?
- I see it.

32
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,526
Houston request,
20 percent X gimbal correction.

33
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,695
- Tell them no.
- Negative.

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,114
Pilgrim,
hold your transfer ellipse steady.

35
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,491
What's going on Hackman?

36
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,244
This isn't right. Computer says,
we're coming in too steep.

37
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,662
Twenty thousand meters.

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,081
Pilgrim dropping rapidly
to Martian surface.

39
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,499
Glide slope is eroding.

40
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,545
- APUs are go.
- Gary?

41
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,338
Increase 20 percent.
Do it now, or we'll burn up.

42
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
Going to manual.

43
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,136
Why is he course correcting?
Why is he course correcting?

44
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,054
- Can someone answer me, please?
- I don't know.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,099
Engaging landing thrusters.
Houston, we're off course.

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,935
Come on.

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,103
We're losing her.

48
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,731
<i>We're losing, man.
We're losing her!</i>

49
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,653
<i>- Houston...</i>

50
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,325
Why?

51
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,498
Congratulations, you're all dead!

52
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,666
Oh.

53
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,420
Third time in a row, Hackman!
Nice move on that course correction!

54
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,297
Paul, it wasn't his fault.

55
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,882
That's right, the navigation computer
keeps telling me to correct it.

56
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,216
It's obviously screwed up.

57
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,761
Oh, that's the problem? Pardon me!

58
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,014
If Gary says,
the computer's screwing up,

59
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,141
then the computer is screwing up,
now why don't you just fix it?

60
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,066
Get me the name of the guy
that wrote this software!

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,133
Better engage the anti-theft device.

62
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,514
Hey! Morning, everybody!
HI, Floyd!

63
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,433
Hey, Kimmie Lee Wong!

64
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,239
Five minutes till
the official workday starts.

65
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,783
That's five minutes
to save the world.

66
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,752
Die! Get back to your own planet!

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,006
You big, bulgy-eyed bald freaks!

68
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,266
Your supervisor showed us in.

69
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,933
He said that you're the man who designed
our mission operating system.

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,650
Sweet Alaskan asparagus tips!
You're the Mars team!

71
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:04,318
- Well, Mr. Randall, uh...
- Paul Wick, Lead Flight Director!

72
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,992
Oh, sir, I am a big fan of yours!
It's, uh...

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,915
William Overbeck.
"Wild Bill" Overbeck!

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,791
In my office!

75
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,170
I feel like a paleontologist
who's been hunting dinosaurs

76
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,255
his whole life
and finally got to meet one.

77
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,090
Thank you.

78
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,510
Eight shuttle missions! Eight of 'em!

79
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,887
It's nine, actually,
but who's counting?

80
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,473
Well, apparently you are, my friend.

81
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,059
Oh, thank you for bringing him here!

82
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,687
-L've been following his career...
- Bill, check this out.

83
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,772
...swirling and swirling and...

84
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,399
Gary Hackman?

85
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,027
Computer specialist!
How's my baby treatin' ya?

86
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,196
- Actually...
- That's why we're here.

87
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,658
Some of us
think it may have a glitch.

88
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,703
A glitch?
Oh, no, that's not possible, I...

89
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,707
I programmed it myself.
It's perfect!

90
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,376
Not exactly.
Your program keeps miscalculating

91
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,128
our orbital entry trajectories.

92
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,547
Here's the data.

93
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,515
Okay, yep, okay, here we go.
Here we go. Here it comes.

94
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,351
Mm-hmm... Yeah.

95
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,271
Got it, got it. There it is.

96
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,815
- What?
- What? There's what?

97
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,152
This popcorn kernel's been stuck
in my molars for the last two weeks!

98
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,325
Well, there's your problem.

99
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,161
Gary's been running
his Hohmann transfer equations

100
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,997
to include gravitational effects

101
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,666
varying as the inverse cube
of the distance.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,877
I'm a decorated astronaut.
I don't make those kind of mistakes.

103
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,797
Well now, wait a minute,
look, I'll show you.

104
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:50,094
I'll enter the same calculations,
using what we call "the right way."

105
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,889
Then, I'll open the lander file

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,351
and I'll initiate
the Mars landing sequence.

107
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,818
I've seen enough.

108
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,697
Watch this, fellas.

109
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,744
This is ridiculous! Come on,
move! Move!

110
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,038
There's nothing wrong
with my numbers. They're perfect.

111
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,876
Hey!

112
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,007
Watch this, you popcorn geek.

113
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,229
See? I told you, it's the computer.

114
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,210
I can explain everything.

115
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,379
Skull fracture!
I can't believe it,

116
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,423
injured while proving himself wrong!

117
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,133
- Look, I can explain it.
- He heard you.

118
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,429
So... what do we do now?

119
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,014
We postpone it.

120
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,600
We can't, Ben!
You've seen the reports

121
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,019
of the surveyor satellite
that we have orbiting mars.

122
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,479
There are periodic sandstorms
on the surface.

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,566
They go on for months at a time.
They make our landing impossible!

124
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:31,028
If we delay now and those storms
set in, we lose our window!

125
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,948
We can't launch again then
for two years!

126
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,741
Then we wait two years!

127
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,118
Ben, Ben, Ben...

128
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,706
If we cancel this launch,
everyone will lose faith in us.

129
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,917
In you. In me.

130
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,668
In the whole NASA team.

131
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,838
But... we could sub in a backup.

132
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,923
And as a matter of fact,
we have two choices.

133
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,635
The first choice, of course,
is Gordon Peacock.

134
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,221
But...

135
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,266
he hasn't tested well
for space travel.

136
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,061
Test him again.
Who's your second choice?

137
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,902
NASA.

138
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,905
Yee-haa!

139
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,742
- Mr. Wick, can I call you Paul?
- No.

140
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,159
- Are we there yet?
- No.

141
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,661
- How far is it?
- Quiet.

142
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,830
- Can I drive?
- No!

143
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,622
Can I park it?

144
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,124
- Hey, it's that stubby guy!
- Fred...

145
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,834
- Is that John Glenn?
- Fred, please come with me.

146
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,544
- I'm sure it was him.
- Fred, I've less than a month

147
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,546
to see if you have
the right stuff to be an astronaut.

148
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,299
Fred, I've got to get you...
I've got to get you

149
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,593
a clearance badge.
You stay right here.

150
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,764
A clearance badge.

151
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,725
Sign at the bottom.

152
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,660
Commander, are you sure
we're headed towards planet Earth?

153
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,829
It looks a heck of a lot
like the sun.

154
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,458
Of course I'm sure, you fool!
How dare you question my authority?

155
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,797
Morning.

156
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,802
Sorry. Sorry. Wasn't me!

157
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,555
Wasn't me.
The cafeteria lady pushed me, Mr...

158
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,310
- Bud Nesbitt?
- Who the hell are you?

159
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,313
Apollo <i>13!</i>
You're the one responsible for the...

160
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,612
I mean, when I say responsible,
I mean I was responsible for this.

161
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,988
- All this.
- Apollo <i>13</i> was an accident.

162
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,076
Oh, sure, sure it was.
Just like the captain of the <i>Exxon</i> Valdez

163
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,912
didn't see Alaska floating there,
right in front of him.

164
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,040
Could I get your autograph
right there?

165
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,964
What, another...
another "accident," Bud?

166
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,383
No, no, no, this... this was all me.
This was...

167
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,969
We were walking down the hall

168
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,638
and the cafeteria lady jumped out
of a doorway

169
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,976
and pushed me right into
Bud Nesbitt, Apollo <i>13</i> wrecker.

170
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,189
Bud's been a little touchy the last...

171
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,318
ten, 15 years.

172
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,597
Who are you?

173
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,518
I'm Fred Rand...
Fred Rand...

174
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,895
That's Fred Randall.

175
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,479
Fred Randall.

176
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,732
Fred, meet your new roommate.

177
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,904
Julie Ford,
mission specialist, geologist.

178
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,365
It's gonna be
a real honor sleeping with you.

179
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,454
In completely different beds.

180
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,543
Fred, she's not your roommate.
He is.

181
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,683
I get it. I get it!
Haze the rookie! Good one!

182
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,727
The legendary
rooming-with-the-monkey gag!

183
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,813
Ulysses is a chimp, not a monkey.

184
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,899
He's a ch...

185
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,735
And he's the key
to discovering life on Mars.

186
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
I'm training him using calls
that he's familiar with

187
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,205
to retrieve specific rock samples
from underground fissures.

188
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,084
Of course. There's still moisture
under the surface.

189
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,462
And where there's water,
there could be life.

190
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,213
That's right. Good boy.

191
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,841
Or death.

192
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,509
Death to anyone who dare to disturb
the vicious Martian crust devils

193
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,893
with their venomous feet
and their wet, sucking lips!

194
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,813
- Uh, Paul?
- Yeah?

195
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,606
Paul, can I talk to you for a second?

196
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,358
Sure.

197
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,199
Well, it looks like it's me and you,
my little Ewok.

198
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,368
You're gonna be
my very first roommate!

199
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,914
- So, what do you think?
- What do I think?

200
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,666
What do you think? I mean,
what is your reasoning here, Paul?

201
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,876
Little Dr. Zaius.

202
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,096
Because we're going to Mars,
we should take along a guy from Mars?

203
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,897
He's a computer genius.
He's supposed to be a little weird.

204
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,107
A little?

205
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,403
Let go of me!

206
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,073
I am not gonna let
a few random personality quirks

207
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,617
ground the most important mission
of my career!

208
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,497
Well, Paul, excuse me for...
for letting my practical concerns

209
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,790
get in the way of your career!

210
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,045
Wait, wait, this mission means just
as much to you as to me, Ford!

211
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:26,046
And if Gordon can't cut it,
then this kid is our last hope.

212
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,806
Well, that's impressive.
They're bonding already.

213
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,271
Mom, please!

214
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,983
I really wish you'd stop referring
to it as "running away from home."

215
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,277
It's only temporary.

216
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,530
Going to Mars is not temporary,
Freddy.

217
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,491
The last time you ran away,
it was just to the garage.

218
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,536
Oh, I know.
You're rebelling, aren't you?

219
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,624
Morn, I don't even know
if I'm going to Mars for sure.

220
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,666
Oh.

221
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,168
Well, I wish I was.

222
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,464
I've made peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,

223
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,758
just like you like them.
It's a long trip.

224
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,052
Morn, I'm not even hungry, honestly.

225
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,514
Look, there's a little moon, a star
and a little rocket.

226
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,227
I'm 30 years old!
I'm almost a full-grown man!

227
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,273
I'll take the rocket.

228
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,576
<i>Well, isn't this</i> a <i>treat!</i>

229
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:39,661
Finally, a place of my own.
No one to tell me what to do.

230
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,679
It wasn't me!

231
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,103
Hey, there's no eating puzzles
in the house!

232
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,814
And surely we don't jump on the bed!

233
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,357
All right, I'm going out.

234
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,195
If you light the place on fire,
the number's 911. Thank you.

235
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,994
<i>Hey, Randall.
C'mon. I'll buy you</i> a <i>drink.</i>

236
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,872
Now wait a second.
I'm not much of a drinker...

237
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,749
Gil, round of Blast Offs
for my friend Randall here.

238
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,003
Blast Off? What's that?

239
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,673
It's a very special drink.
It's just for us astronauts.

240
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,967
Oh, like Tang?

241
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,178
Exactly.

242
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,555
Houston, we have ignition!

243
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,737
- Excellent! Excellent!
- Commencing countdown.

244
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,908
In three, two, one, blast off!

245
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,409
Blast off!

246
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,827
Blast off!

247
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,413
Blast off!

248
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,891
Hey, Ford. Got off work early, huh?

249
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,895
- Is this necessary, Bill?
- Oh, absolutely. Enjoy the show.

250
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,440
Oh, jeez, getting someone drunk
like this is wrong.

251
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,068
Is he the one you want
in the jump seat

252
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,154
next to you, when you're
35 million miles away from home?

253
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,159
Julie Ford!

254
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,162
Julie Ford! Come on. Let's twirl!

255
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,876
We're twirling!

256
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,714
It wasn't me.

257
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,634
You kids have fun now, you hear?

258
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,677
Everyone is laughing at us!

259
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,099
This is not some frat party, Randall!
This is NASA!

260
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,561
And some of us have earned
the right to be here.

261
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,814
And we need someone to replace Gary,
on this mission or it doesn't happen.

262
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,942
So, grow up or get out,
but don't waste my time.

263
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,529
Hey, Julie!

264
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,242
I was just trying to,
you know... fit in.

265
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,389
Julie?

266
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,728
Oh, it's you.

267
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,613
Hey, don't worry, little fella.
It's only thunder.

268
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,073
Scares me too.

269
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,409
Can't sleep, huh?

270
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,703
All right. I'll sing you
a little lullaby, but only one.

271
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:17,215
<i>Hairy little monkey
Sleeping in the night</i>

272
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,508
<i>Close your monkey eyes
So monkey, monkey tight</i>

273
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:29,182
<i>And then you'll know
Little monkey doesn't fright</i>

274
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,062
<i>When the thunder goes boom
So deep into the night</i>

275
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,582
- Paul, this Randall guy is a joke!
- Just give him a chance.

276
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,544
He's not gonna show, you know.
Guy's an embarrassment to NASA!

277
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,047
Now, I understand people like him.
Trust me, he'll be a total professional.

278
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,132
Morning! Morning!

279
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,301
Oh, good, Fred!

280
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,138
Look, we're gonna start
of your testing this morning

281
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,056
with the isolation chamber.

282
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,059
So, for the next 24 hours
we'll see if you can withstand

283
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,019
the extreme isolation of space travel.

284
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,774
Cut off from all external stimuli.
Completely and utterly alone.

285
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,402
No, not exactly. Your competition
is gonna be in the adjacent chamber.

286
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,613
- Gordo!
- Sir.

287
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,991
Hey, Gordon A. Peacock,

288
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,077
computer specialist!

289
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,331
Well, well, well, well, well,
isn't this a treat!

290
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,542
Hey, what kind of laptop do you have?

291
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,086
- Randall, let's go.
- Close it up.

292
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,922
Gordo, you're on the right. Randall,
you're in the left chamber here.

293
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,257
Surely.

294
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,886
Initializing 24-hour clock.

295
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,865
Ah!

296
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,377
Hello?

297
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,255
- What the heck?
- ls that you?

298
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,508
Yes, it's me.

299
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,677
Prove it!

300
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,471
I asked you first!

301
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,058
<i>I asked you first.
I asked you first.</i>

302
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,991
Oh...

303
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,329
<i>John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt</i>

304
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,666
<i>His name is my name too</i>

305
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,503
<i>Whenever we go out
The people always shout</i>

306
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,547
<i>John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt</i>

307
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,761
Oh, he stopped.

308
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,516
<i>The people always shout</i>

309
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,934
<i>John Jacob Jingleheimer...</i>

310
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:19,644
<i>John Jacob Jingleheimer...</i>

311
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,694
Paul, this is inhuman.

312
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,871
<i>I</i> say, Freddy,

313
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,538
it was absolutely lovely to invite us
out of London for the weekend, old boy.

314
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,379
Yes, it's absolutely smashing
to be here, Freddy.

315
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,967
Well, It's my pleasure to have you,
Mr. and Mrs. Plumpton.

316
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,144
Okay, Bill,
let's get 'em out.

317
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,398
Somebody stole my pants.

318
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,777
Yes, you did.

319
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,905
I did not
and I'm telling you, I never will!

320
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,620
Uh, could you give me just a few more
minutes? I just started the third act.

321
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,332
Yes, close the door!
It's bloody chilly in here!

322
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,585
Yes, close the door, you fat...

323
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,170
Don't use that word
around the children.

324
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,234
Yes! Power it down.

325
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,734
Powering down.

326
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,490
Gordo, good work!

327
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,326
Hey. Way to go, Gordo!

328
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,996
Looks like he beat
that motion sickness.

329
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,540
Nice ride, fella!

330
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,794
You probably shouldn't have had
that liverwurst

331
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,837
and headcheese sandwich before this.

332
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,559
Say, Randall, you know
that iso chamber was a cakewalk.

333
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,732
Now, this little baby
is a whole other animal.

334
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,735
Hey, how fast does
this little tree twirl?

335
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,113
Nearly, 200 miles an hour.

336
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,574
That's six Gs.
Bill there holds the record.

337
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,452
Have fun, kid.

338
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,122
Fun is my Chinese neighbor's
middle name!

339
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,926
Man!

340
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,886
Smooth sailing, Randall.

341
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
Stand by.

342
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,895
All right. Let's try four Gs.

343
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,899
Make it five.

344
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,739
Whoa!

345
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,285
Whoa!

346
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,753
Whoa-ca!

347
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,134
A little...

348
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,636
faster...

349
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,598
please.

350
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,310
5.7, 5.8!

351
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,521
Thank you!

352
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,021
Six Gs!

353
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,653
He tied your record, Commander.
Should I stop?

354
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,323
- Give it a little gas!
- Make it seven.

355
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,451
Faster! Faster!

356
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,588
That's enough! Slow down!

357
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,881
Mommy!

358
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,594
I want my mommy!

359
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,977
And what's the most important thing
at NASA, children?

360
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,479
Safety!

361
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,735
Our Father, who art in heaven...

362
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,535
Here we go, Gary. Be brave, huh?
Why don't you try walking?

363
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,079
Get out of the way!

364
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,801
Ouch.

365
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,513
Uh, sorry I'm late.

366
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,432
I, uh.. The...

367
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,060
Iran into Gary and, uh...

368
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,729
Get in the chair, Fred.

369
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,776
The other chair.

370
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,164
Sweet swirling onion rings!

371
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:32,206
Capacitor 15 goes into 12...
Red over on the green... 19 over...

372
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,425
Seventeen into 2, red over into green...
And that's it!

373
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,304
Good, Randall. Really good.

374
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,932
The fastest time I've ever seen.

375
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,311
I, uh...
I designed most of these circuits.

376
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,938
How's it going?

377
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,067
Oh, he's doing great!

378
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,570
Yeah, let's see what happens
under emergency conditions.

379
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,656
You've got one minute
to complete the board,

380
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,073
or your crew dies.

381
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,748
Begin.

382
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,133
You know what to do! Do it!
You doubt yourself, you fail!

383
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,303
Ceiling!
Wall! Floor! You guys!

384
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,012
It's moving too fast!

385
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,100
It'll be a 100 times worse
in real life. Come on, Randall!

386
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,354
Randall...

387
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,939
Look at him! Randall!

388
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,150
Randall, you're hopeless!

389
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,947
HoW'd I do?

390
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,868
One minute and 30 seconds.

391
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,080
Just remember, gentlemen,
the object is to keep

392
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,499
your Ping-Pong ball
airborne as long as possible.

393
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,167
We're testing lung capacity

394
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,210
to determine the time you have
to survive

395
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,338
should a life-support
malfunction occur.

396
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,049
So, you know, uh,
the record's three minutes,

399
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,849
If by some miracle
this kid makes it...

400
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,603
watch out for him, will you?

401
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,146

Bud!

404
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,904
Will you excuse us?

405
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,327

Bill, what do you think?

409
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,129
I think Gordo's an astronaut
and Randall isn't.

410
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,174
Mm, I don't know.

411
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,228
He broke the record!

412

It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

413
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,997
So we will be using a new system
which generates artificial gravity

414
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,419
on this mission.

415
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,298
Ms. Ford, do you expect
to find life on Mars?

416
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:27,260
Absolutely. Yes. Uh, along with my crew,
including Ulysses,

417
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:31,765
I think it is most likely we'll find
microscopic unicellular organisms

418
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,934
which are very similar to those found
in rock fragments from Antarctica.

- Bernard Barrows, BBC.
- Commander Overbeck,

420
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,274
we've all read about the potentially
dangerous windstorms on the surface.

421
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,942
How's that going to affect the mission?

422
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,403
Well, as a former test pilot,

423
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,489
I've experienced my share
of wind problems.

424
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,034
But the ground crew has assured me
that if we launch now,

425
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,537
these storms
shouldn't be any trouble.

426
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,830
Bernard Barrows, BBC.

427
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,584
Mr. Wick, has NASA selected
a replacement crew member yet?

428
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,962
Well, I'm, uh, glad you asked
that question.

429
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,589
Ben, you wanna take that one?

430
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:09,882
Yes. Urn, I have made a decision
on our... replacement

431
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:15,095
and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration

432
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,853
is pleased, as I am pleased,

433
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:23,729
to announce the appointment
of astronaut and third crew member

434
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,028
of the historic manned mission
to Mars,

435
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,322
Astronaut Fred Randall!

436
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,098
I'm not ready, Bud.

437
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,187
Fred, in '68, when President Johnson
appointed me chief of operations

438
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,399
for the Apollo mission, he gave me
three commemorative coins.

439
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,235
One for honor,
which I gave to Armstrong.

440
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,154
One for freedom.
I gave that one to Lovell.

441
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,909
And one... for bravery.

442
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,080
It hasn't done me much good.
Maybe it'll mean something to you.

443
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,000
Whoa.

444
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,128
I feel like the Cowardly Lion.

445
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,881

Ha-ha!

449
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,983
How about just saying,
"Thanks for the cool coin, Bud.

450
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,776
"It really means a lot to me"?

451
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,196
Oh, yeah, thanks for the cool coin,
Bud. It real... What was the rest?

452
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,574
You're welcome, Fred.
Go on.

453
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,625
Good luck, Astronaut Randall!

All right, team. Let's kick the tires
and light the fires.

455
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,570
Don't worry, Ulysses.
Everything's gonna be okay.

456
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,489
Nothing to be scared of.
Look, I'm not scared.

457
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,408
There's no reason

00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,909
Randall,
computer navigation systems.

474
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,328
I have to go tinkle!

475
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,206
CNS, check.

476
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,542
- ECLSS.
- ECLSS. Check.

477
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,502
<i>- APUs.</i>
<i>- APUs</i> are go.

478
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,254
<i>- Abort switch.
- Abort switch on.</i>

479
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,467
- Initiating final launch sequence.
- All right, people. Looking good.

480
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,844
T-minus ten. Let's light her up.

481
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,179
No, not yet!

482
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,515
Ten, nine...

483
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,100
<i>- Fifteen! Twenty-nine!
-...eight, seven...</i>

484
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,518
...six...

485
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,522
<i>There's</i> a <i>fly in my helmet!
Look! It just went up my nose!</i>

486
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,691
...two, one.

487
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,543
We have liftoff, 0232 GMT!

488
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,484
Yes!

489
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,279
Oh, my Lord...

490
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,949
I hope I packed him
enough underwear.

491
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,827
I wouldn't worry about that, pumpkin.

492
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,578
He's packin'
his own underwear right now.

493
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,346
Ch, my...

494
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,017
Are you guys seeing this?

495
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,811
My helmet!

496
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,733
Did you see that?

497
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,444
My face went back like this
and then I...

498
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,865
These things flew
out of my mouth and...

499
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,535
Can we do that again?

500
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,789
I like this!

501
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:21,253
Hey, I'm floating up in the air!
Like a little bird, like a crow!

502
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,346
Hey, look. There's a big field
of corn down there everybody!

503
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:31,392
Engaging artificial gravity
in three, two, one.

504
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,237
Hey, Randall,
take a look out the window.

505
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,702
Wow...

506
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,248
It really does look like
a giant blueberry.

507
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,584
Hi, Mom.

508
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,878
Hi, Dad.

509
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,300
<i>Commander, can I call you Bill?</i>

510
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,927
No.

511
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,262
- Are we there <i>yet?</i>
- No.

512
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,473
<i>- Could I drive?</i>
<i>- No!</i>

513
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,141
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

514
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,769
Ulysses, it's yum-yum time!

515
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,691
OW!

516
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,027
Ow, the flesh, it burns!

517
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,947
Ow. Need some burn ointment.

518
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:40,502
You hungry, Ulysses?
Here, you eat the monkey fruitcake.

519
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,589
Now go sit at the table.
Sit at the table.

520
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,509
Randall, where's that dinner?

521
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,803
It's just coming out of the oven, Bill.

522
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,477
Okay, people. Let's eat up. In 20 minutes
we got a broadcast with the president

523
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,936
and the entire free world.

524
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,522
But, if it's all the same
as you guys,

525
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,733
I'm gonna sit that one out.

526
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,025
So, what you make for dinner?

527
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,612
Prime rib with broccoli
and mashed potatoes.

528
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,827
Oh, Julie's doing her
Old Yeller impression!

529
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,747
Please, Pa.
I don't want Yeller to die!

530
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,460
Fred, it's tooth paste!

531
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,431
That's not potatoes.

532
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,432
I'm sorry, what?

533
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,017
This is not...

534
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,772
Oh, man, this is hemorrhoid cream!

535
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,192
Hemorrhoid cream!

536
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,617
Hey, swallow your food there, fella!

537
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,127
Dear Mr. President...

538
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,465
Dear world and Mr. President...

539
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,350
That came out of nowhere.

540
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,605
Oh, look out, Sally!

541
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,276
Be careful you don't
get sucked out when you flush.

542
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,570
- What?
- Happens all the time.

543
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,804
Oh, no, Bud's coin!

544
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,689
Come to papa.

545
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,036
<i>Good evening,
my fellow Americans</i>

546
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,830
and citizens of the world.

547
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,791
Tonight, we are privileged
to be speaking live

548
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,085
with our courageous Mars astronauts.

549
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,045
<i>Good evening, Commander.</i>

550
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,591
Good evening, Mr. President.
Welcome aboard the Aries.

551
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,802
I would like to say
that this mission is intended

552
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,763
to honor
all of the peoples of the world,

553
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,308
for space
is about the highest yearning...

554
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,270
<i>- Are we on?
-...of mank... of mankind.</i>

555
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,231
<i>I don't mean to cut you off, Commander,</i>

556
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,192
but I'm going to,
because I spy Fred Randall there

557
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,902
and I believe that the people
of the world

558
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,906
would like to know just why
he looks like a Smurf tonight.

559
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,159
<i>Officer Randall has some duties
to perform in another...</i>

560
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,285
<i>-in another part of the spacecraft.
- We are on!</i>

561
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,620
<i>If I could just finish this...</i>

562
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,664
-this thought...
- Say <i>hello</i> to the world, son.

563
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,793
Me? Yes, Mr. President...

564
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,298
- I don't think that I...
- Tell them what it's like up here.

565
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,926
Yeah, son, you <i>go</i> ahead.

566
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,805
Mr. President, sir,
from up here I can...

567
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:24,017
Well, I can see the whole world
out that window, and...

568
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,895
Well, I know down there there's
a lot of wars

569
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,732
and people fighting so on and whatnot,

570
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,402
but from up here,
I feel like I could just take

571
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,571
the whole world
and hold it in my hands

572
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,824
just like a ripe blueberry.

573
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,453
I feel like I could...
It's almost like I...

574
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,793
<i>I got the whole world in my hands</i>

575
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,587
<i>I got the whole world in my hands</i>

576
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,175
<i>I got the whole world in my hands</i>

577
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,261
<i>I got the whole world in my hands</i>

578
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:03,098
<i>All right, now the French!</i>

579
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:15,899
Now the Germans!

580
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,827
<i>C'mon. Just the Western Hemisphere!</i>

581
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,705
<i>He's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

582
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:27,957
<i>Come on, Commander!</i>

583
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:32,336
<i>He's got the whole wide world
In his hands</i>

584
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,965
<i>He's got
The whole damn world in his hands</i>

585
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,426
<i>He's got
The whole world in his hands</i>

586
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,553
<i>Everybody, now!</i>

587
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,765
<i>He's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

588
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,196
And now the Chinese!
C'mon, all you Chinese!

589
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,481
- Hey, there's my star.
- What?

590
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:38,606
My star. When I was a kid,
I picked one out of the sky.

591
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,863
Called it Fred's Star.

592
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,907
It was my own special little place
I could go to

593
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,826
and no one could ever find me.

594
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,789
- That is so weird! I did that too.
- You did?

595
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,083
Yes!

596
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,459
Which one is yours?

597
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:59,002
Well, urn, actually, it's that one, see,
just to the right of the North Star.

598
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,051
Kinda flickering over there?

599
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,219
- That's funny.
- Why?

600
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,972
Well, that one's right next to mine.

601
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,979
It's... It's amazing,
isn't it, Julie?

602
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,605
Yeah.

603
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,358
You know, for all
the research I've done,

604
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,403
I still don't really understand
what's out there.

605
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,324
I mean, I believe
that there's something...

606
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,745
I just... lwish... lwish I...

607
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,372
Well, why don't you?

608
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,915
What?

609
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:37,582
Wish. Use your star.
It's like that Jiminy Cricket song.

610
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:43,259
<i>When you wish upon</i> a <i>star</i>

611
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:48,635
<i>Makes no difference who you are</i>

612
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,350
<i>And when you wish</i>

613
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,353
<i>Upon a star</i>

614
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,855
<i>Your dreams</i>

615
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:02,190
<i>Come true</i>

616
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,616
That's Jiminy Cricket.

617
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,167
I don't know
about this hypersleep thing.

618
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,753
It's perfectly safe. Besides,
can't stay awake for eight months.

619
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,463
The boredom would drive you crazy.

620
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:26,756
Eight months? The eye crust alone
could be dangerous! Hey, Commander!

621
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,472
Ah! It burns the flesh!

622
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,142
So anyway, Ford,
wake me up when we get to Mars.

623
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,477
You got it.

624
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,604
Good night, ladies.

625
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,774
So, I'll see you in eight months.

626
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:46,359
Boy, I wish I had 928 dollars for every
time a girl's said that to me.

627
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,907
Good night, Fred.

628
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,536
Good night, Julie Ford.

629
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,466
Well, it's a tale as old as time,
Ulysses.

630
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,885
Boy meets girl,
boy falls for girl...

631
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,638
girl goes into hypersleep.

632
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,810
No, see, you can't be in here
because yours is over there.

633
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,442
This is mine.

634
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,736
Okay, I'm going in here.

635
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,197
You can stay right there

636
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,074
and I'm gonna take yours,
you hairy little bed stealer!

637
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,119
Good night. Gotta close the door.

638
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,414
Just gotta close this...

639
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,503
Gotta close the door...

640
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,333
Oh! Eight-month-old morning breath.

641
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,553
Morning glory and hallelujah,
Commander!

642
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,202
Query. How long have I been asleep?

643
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,413
Thirteen minutes!

644
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,336
Gah! No!

645
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,088
<i>Ha-ha, Fred!</i>

646
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,010
Crazy blanket!
No man could sleep with you!

647
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,697
<i>Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. Go to sleep...</i>

648
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,583
<i>My darling,
what</i> a <i>wonderful evening.</i>

649
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:31,338
You look so beautiful tonight,
so... full of life.

650
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,217
Your hair looks like corn silk,

651
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,845
soft, snowy skin
and your tangerine lips...

652
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,931
And your...

653
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,117
Hi! It's me again!

654
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,869
Whack, whack, whack!

655
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,497
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up, wake up!

656
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,167
<i>Fred. Come out, Fred.
You can't hide forever, Fred.</i>

657
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,879
<i>- They're coming to get me, Fred.
- Bwana! It's me,</i> Fred.

658
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,384
They've taken over the ship.
50, 60 of them!

659
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,679
I've had to hide in the jungle.
Take this down.

660
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:25,058
I need four barrels of gunpowder,
a machete, a goatskin,

661
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,227
a guide that speaks Hutu.

662
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,521
<i>Fred, snap out of it.
Fred, snap out of it.</i>

663
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,898
<i>Fred, snap out of it.
Fred, snap...</i>

664
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,485
<i>It wasn't me!</i>

665
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,329
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

666
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,456
Hello?

667
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,916
<i>Fred?</i>

668
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,460
Can I ask who's calling? Over.

669
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,088
It's Bud.
Go to the private medical channel.

670
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,508
<i>- Bud.</i> Where have you <i>been?</i> Over.
- Why are you awake?

671
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,885
Well, there was a series
of very bad mistakes

672
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,137
that happened all at once,

673
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,638
but everything's fine
and my spirits are high.

674
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,349
<i>The ship is in shipshape,
and by the way,</i>

675
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,727
<i>the Hutu uprising is over. Over.</i>

676
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,939
Forget the "overs." I don't know
how can I'm gonna keep this from Wick.

677
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,234
You don't have to. I've already
reprogrammed the hypersleep monitors.

678
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,444
He doesn't have to know.

679
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,238
Ration your food.
I'll do what I can.

680
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,574
<i>Bud, there's something else,
I've</i> been <i>looking</i>

681
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,119
<i>at the latest
weather surveyor photos from Mars.</i>

682
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,787
What are you talking about?

683
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,581
I can't be sure but I have a feeling
that when we land,

684
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,917
we might run
into some nasty windstorms.

685
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,669
That's impossible.
None of our people picked that up.

686
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,381
<i>I know.
I almost missed it myself.</i>

687
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,801
<i>If you look in sectors five and six
of the Valles Marineris, you'll see tha...</i>

688
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,387
Way too low for this time
of the year. This could be bad.

689
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,013
What do we do?

690
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,557
<i>We do nothing.</i>

691
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,892
<i>If Wick finds out you're awake,
he'll go through the roof.</i>

692
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,978
Let me go to him
with this weather business,

693
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,313
he'll have no choice,
he'll have to reconsider the mission.

694
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,357
Reconsider the mission? Sure.

695
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,776
Hm. Okay, it's still on.

696
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:43,363
Paul, look at these new readouts.
The danger is real!

697
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,156
I don't have to look at anything, Bud!

698
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,744
I've a room full of experts telling me
that everything's just peachy

699
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,038
and you walk up to me and tell me
to reconsider a $40 billion mission

700
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,331
just because you've got a hunch?

701
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,166
- That's right.
-l'm sorry, Bud,

702
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,169
your hunches are worth about
as much as dental floss

703
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,754
at a Willie Nelson concert.

704
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,299
I'll be monitoring this situation
If the data doesn't change...

705
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,761
You'll leave it to me
to make the call, as always.

706
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,938
<i>Voila.</i>

707
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,823
February, March,
April, May, June, July,

708
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,868
August...
Whoopsy. Wake-up time.

709
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:31,995
Hypersleep over.

710
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,248
Come on, Ford. I'm starving!

711
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,584
Randall,
why are you dressed like that?

712
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,378
What have you been doing?

713
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,257
Oh, just making coffee. You know,
I'm a morning person.

714
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,883
Good morning, Julie.

715
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,260
What happened in here?

716
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:52,803
Well, I'll be the first to say it.
It looks like we've got space rats.

717
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:54,810
Space rats?

718
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:56,937
You've been awake!

719
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,732
No! It wasn't me!
It was the hairy one!

720
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,151
Him! The naughty!

721
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,243
Well, it's obvious he's very sorry

722
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,536
and doesn't want
to talk about it anymore.

723
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,415
Oh, my God.

724
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,427
Wow.

725
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,889
Turns out Ulysses
is one of those rare...

726
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,685
genius painting monkeys.

727
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,728
That's food.

728
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,774
You've been awake the whole time,
and you used up all of our food!

729
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,525
- Didn't you? Didn't you?
- No. No.

730
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:48,113
Look at this! What are we supposed
to do now, fish?

731
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,867
This... Look! Look! It's gone!
We're doomed!

732
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,409
-L've got backup supplies.
- You understand me?

733
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,536
I've got lots of backups.

734
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,665
Oh, what have you got here?
Anchovy paste. I love this stuff!

735
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,167
- Creamed liver! This is good.
-lt's good for your gums.

736
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:05,130
Gefilte fish! I'm not eating
gefilte fish for the rest of this trip!

737
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,548
- Bill.
- What?

738
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,383
We're here.

739
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,290
All right, kids. Here we go.

740
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,501
Randall, stop eating
and pay attention.

741
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,421
<i>Houston, we have separation.</i>

742
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,507
<i>Request permission
to engage descent burn.</i>

743
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,092
Roger, Pilgrim.
Confirm separation.

744
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,427
<i>Roger that.</i>

745
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,054
We have separation confirmed.

746
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,680
Pilgrim, you are a-go
for descent burn.

747
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,183
<i>Roger that, Houston.
Commencing decent burn.</i>

748
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:12,238
Pilgrim is through
the high gate at 80 percent.

749
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,157
Status?

750
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,576
Aeroshell deployed.
Deceleration rate, normal.

751
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,579
ECLSS is go.
They have entered Martian atmosphere.

752
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,585
Bill, we've got a problem!
Glide slope increasing!

753
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:26,920
I see it, Ford.

754
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,384
- We're losing stable trajectory.
- Randall, status.

755
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,972
<i>Commander, we need</i> a <i>five percent</i>
Z <i>gimbal correction one percent.</i>

756
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,682
- No, wait, wait...
- I need a number, Randall!

757
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,894
- Ten percent. No, 12!
- Trajectory's eroding!

758
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,522
- Is it ten or 12?
- Twelve, I'm going with 12. I'm sorry.

759
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,483
Initiating 12 percent Z gimbal
course correction.

760
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,364
Communication shutdown
for three minutes.

761
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,876
I knew it was 12.

762
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,719
Holy cow.

763
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,430
Look at that.

764
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,151
Engaging landing thrusters.

765
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,446
It's okay, you little fella.
It's gonna be okay.

766
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,200
Pilgrim, this is Houston.

767
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,954
Pilgrim, this is Houston do you copy?

768
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,708
Pilgrim, this is Houston.
Come in, please.

769
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,798
<i>Houston, this is Planitia Base.
The Pilgrim has landed.</i>

770
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,984
<i>Commander William Overbeck
is the first out of the capsule</i>

771
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,070
<i>and within seconds
will step onto the surface of Mars</i>

772
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,490
<i>and into the history books.
We all eagerly...</i>

773
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,160
This is a very big day for us, Ben.
Very big.

774
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,037
<i>Mr. President,
peoples of the world,</i>

775
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,915
<i>for a poor farm boy
from Iowa, this is one</i>

776
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,709
heck of an honor to be
the first man

777
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,544
to travel to a distant planet...

778
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,546
- Fred, go slowly...
- ...to be the first man

779
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,756
to set foot on the surface of Mars.

780
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:41,971
It wasn't me!

781
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,142
Randall,
I'm gonna kick your butt!

782
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,286
My god!

783
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,330
It's amazing!

784
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,500
We're the first
to ever stand on Mars!

785
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,960
Now you're the biggest idiot
on two planets.

786
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,088
We're the first
to talk on Mars!

787
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,342
Hey, Julie, I'm the first
to walk backwards on Mars!

788
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,097
First to blow a kiss on Mars!

789
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,352
Hey, you're the first
to blush on Mars.

790
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,687
Fred!

791
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,231
How'd you like to be
the first guy to die on Mars?

792
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,985
Well, sorry, Mr. First
To Show Inappropriate Anger On Mars!

793
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,780
I'm not listening, Randall.
I'm turning this radio off.

794
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,908
Well, you're the first
to not listen to me on Mars.

795
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,160
- Na, na, na, na, na.
- Please talk to me.

796
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,832
I wanna get to know you
more for the first time on Mars.

797
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,631
- Are we there yet?
- No.

798
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,800
- Can I drive?
- No!

799
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,094
- You never let me drive!
- Shut up.

800
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:07,432
Hey, there's no airbag.
What if I flying through the windshield?

801
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,809
Randall,
there is no windshield.

802
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:13,562
Oh. Well, what if I go flying
through the front of my helmet?

803
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,773
I'd die happy.

804
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:22,155
Well, this is it. Valles Marineris.

805
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,615
Stop here, Ford.
This'll be perfect.

806
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,286
This is where we plant the flag.

807
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:29,829
Roger.

808
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,373
I'll set up the weather station,
and take the drilling samples

809
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,666
and be back in an hour.

810
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,798
I'll offload this equipment.

811
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:43,885
Rendezvous back here at 1400 hours.

812
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,595
Fourteen hundred hours. Check.

813
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,639
Be careful out there, Ford.

814
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,357
All right, this is the spot.
It's the perfect spot right here.

815
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,944
<i>What you doing, Randall?
Where's that flag?</i>

816
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,863
<i>It's coming, Commander.</i>

817
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,452
Uh-oh, it wasn't me!

818
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,163
But I'll get it!
I think I saw where it went.

819
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:20,838
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no, no.</i>

820
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,924
You moron!

821
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,842
Who are you talking to,
Commander?

822
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,261
You realize
what you've just done?

823
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,723
I waited my whole life
for this moment,

824
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,726
to plant a flag on a distant planet.

825
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,313
Now I'm on a distant planet,
which was the hard part...

826
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,358
and I don't have a flag
'cause you lost it!

827
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,236
Don't worry, Commander!
I've got another flag!

828
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:49,029
A high-flying flag! A proud flag!
A wonderful flag!

829
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,078
What are you doing?

830
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,872
We're making history,
Commander!

831
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,334
<i>Randall.</i>

832
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,797
And, salute!

833
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,218
- Huh?
- Ten-hut!

834
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,679
It's the president.

835
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,018
Why don't I just
throw myself off this cliff?

836
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,647
- Why don't I throw you off?
- Don't worry, they're clean.

837
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,819
Paul, we got a red on Overbeck.

838
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,780
We have a primary oxygen tank leak.
We need to preserve his SOP.

839
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,282
Solution?

840
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,284
Emergency tie line.
We hook him into another suit.

841
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,869
Do it, doc.

842
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,498
Bill, this is Houston. You got
a leak in your primary O2 tank.

843
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,542
<i>I see it. What do we do?</i>

844
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,711
You got an emergency line
in your flix,

845
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,421
hook it up
with Randall's spare vent nozzle

846
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,048
and your share
till you get back to the Pilgrim.

847
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,093
<i>Houston, is that sanitary?</i>

848
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,766
- Hey, Commander?
- Yeah?

849
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,311
Do you believe in UFOs at all?

850
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,437
Sure, I believe in UFOs.

851
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,772
You do?

852
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,692
Yeah. There's one following me.

853
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,738
Huh? Oh, I get it!
You're funny, Commander!

854
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,035
Hey, Commander?

855
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:16,954
Yeah?

856
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,706
When I was a kid...

857
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,168
at night I used to there was
a baker under my bed.

858
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,754
Did you ever have anything
under your bed?

859
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,507
- No.
- Did you ever bend down and look?

860
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,384
No.

861
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,512
Well, how do you know
there wasn't a baker under your bed?

862
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,348
Randall, shut up.

863
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,058
Hey, Commander?

864
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,726
Yeah?

865
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:43,022
I seem to be experiencing these
intense intestinal cramps.

866
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,484
Randall, I'm trying
to conserve oxygen here.

867
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,111
- But they hurt me so.
- Keep it to yourself.

868
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,613
- Ow. Ow.
- Wait a minute.

869
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,951
If we stay on this heading
for another 20 minutes,

870
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,244
we'll see the Pilgrim.

871
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,173
What?
I didn't do anything.

872
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,637
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

873
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,431
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't do that.

874
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,851
No, no. Come on.

875
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:23,312
Oh, man!

876
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,649
Oh!

877
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:27,983
Uh!

878
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:31,070
- It wasn't me.
- What do you mean, it wasn't you?

879
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,281
We're 35 million miles
from the nearest person!

880
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,660
Heart rate up, adrenaline up,
stomach muscles spasming!

881
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,873
- Overbeck's in distress.
- Look at these methane levels.

882
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:46,623
Methane?

883
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,010
Oh! Oh, it's in my mouth!

884
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,846
Hey! He who smelt it, dealt it!

885
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:07,815
What?

886
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,249
Commander,
I'm having trouble breathing.

887
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:29,420
You're having trouble breathing?
My eyes are burning!

888
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,757
Truly, it wasn't me!
Maybe it was Julie.

889
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:35,926
- You dog!
- Hey, miracles can happen.

890
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,512
Blaming this on Julie!

891
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,264
Okay, I admit it was me.

892
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,558
Thank you!

893
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,185
Now that was Julie!

894
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,364
This isn't good, Bill.
I think Fred's right.

895
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,823
Looks like the winds
are coming early.

896
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,994
Maybe two or three days.
Look at these readings I took today.

897
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,578
We should still be all right tomorrow.

898
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,623
Oh no, wait a second. No.
It's not gonna be all right.

899
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,916
My calculations are telling me

900
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,711
that... that these two martian
high-pressure systems

901
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,630
are coming together faster
than any of us could've predicted.

902
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,215
Tomorrow.

903
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,093
When that happens, we're nothing more
than a dust bunny,

904
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,804
stuck in a bag of a vacuum.

905
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,139
You go out there,
you're not comin' back.

906
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,310
What are you doing, Randall?
What are you doing?

907
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,854
What, it's not enough that you broke
every record that I ever set?

908
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:32,066
That you humiliated me
on global television?

909
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,611
That you ruined what should've been
the most important moment

910
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,820
of my life by stepping on Mars first?

911
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,615
That's not enough for you!
You've got to do this!

912
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,618
No, no. This one is mine.

913
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,745
We came to Mars
to gather fossil samples.

914
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,039
We're not leaving here
until I accomplish this!

915
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,874
Wait. Bill...

916
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:53,087
I don't want to abort this mission
any more than you do, but...

917
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:57,925
I know he's right.

918
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:03,055
If we don't leave before
this storm hits, we don't leave.

919
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,393
All right, what do you suggest?

920
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,647
Tomorrow morning, we check
the readings. If they're bad...

921
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,316
we abort.

922
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,194
All right. Fine.

923
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:19,905
Let's get some sleep.

924
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,415
<i>What did Overbeck say?</i>

925
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,085
<i>He said we should wait
till morning. You know, Bud,</i>

926
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:37,423
<i>maybe I was wrong about the winds.
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.</i>

927
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,468
I wanna tell you something,
Fred. About the <i>13</i> mission.

928
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,055
The day before launch,
I... I caught what seemed to be

929
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,723
a minor glitch
in the tank's stirring circuits.

930
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,393
Didn't look serious,
but I went to Wick,

931
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,729
I told him, we needed to postpone until we
could greenlight the system.

932
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,733
He said, there was no way
we were gonna push back the launch date,

933
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,276
he said that I was overreacting,

934
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,778
that I was imagining a problem
when there was none.

935
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,615
So Apollo <i>13</i>
was Wick's fault?

936
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,743
<i>No. I had every right
and authority to stop that launch</i>

937
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,828
<i>but I didn't. I didn't make the call.</i>

938
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,581
<i>And if those three astronauts
hadn't pulled off</i>

939
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,333
a <i>number
of last minute major miracles,</i>

940
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,960
<i>they would have been dead
and it would've been my fault.</i>

941
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,713
<i>I'm not gonna let that happen
this time.</i>

942
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,215
<i>I'm gonna get you guys out of this.</i>

943
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,219
- Hey, Bud.
<i>- What?</i>

944
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,345
I'd be proud to end up like you.

945
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,224
I copy that.

946
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,185
Bud out.

947
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,020
The mushroom <i>people</i>

948
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:37,483
- are coming! Get <i>them</i> away!
- Fred! Wake up! Fred! Fred!

949
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,820
Bill's gone. He took Ulysses
and the spare backpack,

950
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,113
and he is gone.

951
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,282
Sweet mother of meat!

952
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,202
Huh? Uh-oh!

953
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,837
All right, buddy. Here we are.

954
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,591
Go on... Go on.

955
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:10,725
How are they doing up there, Paul?

956
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:13,435
Oh, good morning, sir.
Yes, we're just about to wake the crew.

957
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,479
Would you like this one, sir?

958
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,273
Oh, great.

959
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:21,694
It's over, Paul.

960
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,779
Sir, I'm making the call.
We abort now.

961
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,532
No one's listening to you, Bud.
Don't make me call security.

962
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,992
I'm not gonna stand by
and let another disaster happen!

963
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,288
This man has continually ignored
the warnings of our crew on Mars.

964
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,332
- Security, would you come in here, please?
- Our mission is in serious jeopardy, sir.

965
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,708
Bud...

966
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,757
Don't make this any harder
than it already is.

967
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:45,301
- Don't do this, sir.
- Bud, would you take it easy?

968
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,137
We're all under a lot of stress.
You just need to rest. That's all!

969
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,641
- Ben, those people are gonna die.
- Bud, you have totally lost it.

970
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,269
We haven't had any negative reports.

971
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,479
Get him out of here, please.

972
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,441
Paul, we've got a contact
on emergency frequency.

973
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,612
- On screen.
- Pilgrim, this is Houston.

974
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,448
<i>Houston, the storms are here!
Wind speed at, uh...</i>

975
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,367
<i>- Forty-five.
- ... 45 miles per hour and rising!</i>

976
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,204
<i><i>- Visibility dropping.</i>
<i>- Houston, what should we do?</i></i>

977
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,206
<i>Houston, please advise!</i>

978
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,498
Paul?

979
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,379
Randall, no! That's...
that's impossible.

980
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,422
Our weather pattern analysis...

981
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,090
<i>Mr. Wick, this is bad,
I don't think</i>

982
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:27,009
<i>I've ever seen anything
like this before.</i>

983
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,095
<i>It reminds me of a French Canadian...</i>

984
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,430
<i>Tennis racket stuck
to the back of a...</i>

985
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:32,389
<i>It's no good...</i>

986
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,849
<i>Bubbling out of my sister's...</i>

987
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,142
<i>Brazilian donkey!</i>

988
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,311
<i>I don't think
I can make myself any clearer!</i>

989
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,271
Wick, get 'em off that planet!

990
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,316
Do as he says, Paul.

991
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,277
Ben, we had no way of knowing.

992
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,948
I followed procedure, Ben.

993
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,116
I followed procedure, here!

994
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,952
Paul, unplug and go home.

995
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,038
Unplug and go home?

996
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,332
Nesbitt, you're in command.

997
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,294
<i>Houston, do you copy?
Houston, come in!</i>

998
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,630
Pilgrim we copy.
Please stand by.

999
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,925
Don't stare at me, people!
We got a crew out there!

1000
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,636
Let's bring 'em home.

1001
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,904
<i>Houston, wind speed continues
to increase.</i>

1002
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,824
- This is bad, <i>Paul.</i>
- Ford, it's Bud. Listen carefully.

1003
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,996
If the wind keeps building at this rate,
in 20 minutes, liftoff will be impossible.

1004
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,206
Launch now.

1005
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:43,293
<i>No! Commander Overbeck
and Ulysses are still out there!</i>

1006
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,261
They're lost now. You're not.

1007
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,055
Launch!

1008
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,807
<i>- L'm going after them.
- What?</i>

1009
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,060
Fred? Fred, answer me! Fred!

1010
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,021
<i>Can't hear you!
We're fading out fast!</i>

1011
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,481
Fred!

1012
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,110
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
you've gotta take off without me!

1013
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,945
<i>- Fred!</i>
- You will be back.

1014
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,739
- Twenty minutes and then take off!
<i>- Fred!</i>

1015
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,792
Twenty minutes, right?
Not 15 or anything?

1016
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:24,877
All right.

1017
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,051
Twenty-one is okay too.

1018
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:56,992
Ford, what's going on?

1019
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,370
What's happening?
I'm losing you! Julie!

1020
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,788
Commander!

1021
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,458
Commander Overbeck!

1022
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,170
Ulysses!

1023
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,216
Ulysses!

1024
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,972
Where are you? Answer me!

1025
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,644
There you are!

1026
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,896
How many times have I told you not

1027
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,273
to wander around
in a Martian dust storm!

1028
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,109
We've got to find the commander.

1029
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,657
Where are they?

1030
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,370
Commander!

1031
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,331
Commander Overbeck!

1032
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,208
Randall?

1033
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,502
Commander, is that you?

1034
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,213
- Randall!
- It is you!

1035
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,550
All right, stand back,
little fella. Nothin' to see here.

1036
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,887
- Commander!
- What are you doing here?

1037
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,139
Get back to the ship
and save yourself!

1038
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,557
Sorry Commander,
I can't do that.

1039
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:03,893
That's an order!

1040
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,560
I've got to get you out.

1041
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,606
I can't lift it.

1042
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,983
They say that when
a mother's child is trapped,

1043
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:14,445
the rush of her adrenaline gives her
the strength of 20 men.

1044
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,613
All right, Commander,
call me "Mommy"!

1045
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,158
- What?
- Call me "Mommy," now!

1046
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,245
I'd rather die
in the Martian dirt!

1047
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,123
- Who am I?
- Just lift the stinkin' thing!

1048
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:27,583
Who am I?

1049
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,585
Mommy.

1050
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,753
Say it like you love me.

1051
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:38,802
Mommy.
Please, Mommy, save me.

1052
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,347
- Mommy's coming, little Billy!
- Save me!

1053
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,351
Live, child! Live!

1054
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,398
You're alive, little Billy!

1055
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,025
Don't you ever call me
"Little Billy"!

1056
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,403
That's no way
to talk to your mother!

1057
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:58,906
<i>Houston, this is Ford.</i>

1058
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,407
Julie, where's Fred?

1059
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,452
<i>Still out there.
I'm initiating launch sequence.</i>

1060
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,120
Wait, they still have time
to get back!

1061
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:06,580
<i>Give 'em a chance!</i>

1062
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,456
I know what I'm doing.

1063
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,338
Which way, Commander?

1064
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,675
I don't know. Can't get a reading.
Let's get down behind that rock.

1065
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:19,843
Come on, Ulysses.

1066
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,555
I'm gonna go out there
and take a closer look.

1067
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,934
<i>W's the Pilgrim!</i>

1068
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,687
It's too late! She's taking off!

1069
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:34,024
She's guiding us
with the engines! Come on!

1070
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,902
I'll get Ulysses. Ulysses...

1071
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:39,696
Ulysses.

1072
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,198
The tank's empty!

1073
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:42,908
We'll share air.

1074
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,493
We don't have a spare hose,
remember?

1075
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:49,498
Well, then I'll give him mine.
You don't leave friends behind.

1076
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,333
What are you gonna do?
Hold your breath?

1077
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,043
You'll never make it to the Pilgrim!

1078
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,628
Don't forget, Commander,

1079
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:58,715
I'm the new NASA record holder
for lung capacity.

1080
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:03,137
That was three minutes!
This is, what, four, maybe five?

1081
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,138
What? You ignore me
the whole trip

1082
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,725
and now that I have no air
you wanna chat?

1083
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:09,601
Randall...

1084
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:15,398
Randall? Randall! Randall!

1085
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,364
Oh, no, not now!

1086
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,663
Twenty minutes are up, Julie.

1087
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,040
Wait... I see someone!

1088
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,834
Ford, what's going on?

1089
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:37,337
<i>- Ford who"! got it! J I '</i>
- S <i>It? “we, do You copy?</i>

1090
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,755
<i>Julie?</i>

1091
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,342
<i>Fred, are you there? Fred?
Copy, somebody!</i>

1092
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,803
Bill! Where's Fred?

1093
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,681
He should've been here.
Don't launch.

1094
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,684
There he is!

1095
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,687
Fred...
He's going the other way! Fred!

1096
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,981
Hey! Fred!

1097
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,493
- Get me outta this!
- What are you doing?

1098
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,162
It's empty anyway-

1099
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,916
- He's holding his breath out there.
- Oh, my God!

1100
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,295
If we're not back in five minutes...

1101
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,886
Hurry! Hurry, Bill!

1102
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:37,313
Bill. Bill, is he all right?
ls he okay?

1103
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:40,025
He's not breathing!
Get his helmet off!

1104
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,823
Don't even think about it, Randall!

1105
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,121
<i>Houston, Houston
this is Pilgrim...</i>

1106
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,667
- Carol Ann? Go into the light, honey.
- Houston?

1107
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,209
- Fred...
- Honey, go into the light.

1108
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,419
Houston?

1109
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:04,253
- Oh, it's you! Ulysses!
- No! Julie!

1110
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,801
No. Ulysses needs air!

1111
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,514
<i>Houston! Come in, please!
We're on board.</i>

1112
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,893
<i>- We need go for launch.
- Get the</i> hell <i>out of there!</i>

1113
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,188
<i>Roger that, Houston.
Preparing for launch.</i>

1114
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,106
Not the hairy one! Take me!

1115
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,817
- Priming main thrusters.
- Rocket boosters intact.

1116
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:28,615
Fred? Fred! Fred, he's fine!
He's just resting.

1117
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:33,036
- In the next five, we're ready to go.
- Thrusters go in three, two...

1118
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:34,496
- Hold on.
- ...one.

1119
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,418
We have liftoff.

1120
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,711
Fifty meters.

1121
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,380
One hundred.

1122
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:46,050
- Increasing velocity.
- Two hundred meters.

1123
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:51,221
Course is good.
Nice flying, Uncle Walnut.

1124
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,432
One thousand.
Two thousand.

1125
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,392
Increasing velocity.

1126
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,270
Five thousand.
Six thousand...

1127
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,189
- Eight thousand.
- Just a little higher.

1128
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:02,941
You're almost clear of the storm.

1129
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,276
<i>Ten thousand.</i>

1130
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,573
- All systems green.
- I think we made it.

1131
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,123
What the hell was that?

1132
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,878
- Houston, we've had an impact!
- It wasn't me!

1133
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,672
Navigation controls
are compromised!

1134
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,675
<i>Switching to auxiliary power.
We're losing velocity!</i>

1135
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:29,968
Status!

1136
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:32,137
ECLSS down, OMS down,
visual contact down.

1137
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,472
- They got a total kill here.
- Solutions!

1138
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,058
Randall rewires
the entire operation system circuitry

1139
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,685
in less than two minutes.
End of solutions.

1140
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,103
Bud, what do we do here?

1141
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:41,980
We do nothing.

1142
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,190
Pilgrim is in a freefall.

1143
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,446
Nav controls are out. Randall,
I need the engine computers up now!

1144
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,366
This time it was definitely not me!

1145
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,245
I'm switching to manual.
Randall, check below.

1146
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,917
Randall, how's it look down there?

1147
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:06,046
Like this!

1148
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:07,756
Well, fix it!

1149
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,634
Will you stop this ship from tumbling
and give me about a week?

1150
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,761
I can't stop the tumbling
and you've got two minutes!

1151
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:20,431
<i>To recap the story, the Pilgrim
was caught in a violent sandstorm</i>

1152
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,522
<i>and is now tumbling towards
the Martian surface.</i>

1153
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:27,442
<i>We're standing by to hear what
the latest NASA has to say</i>

1154
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,860
<i>about this terrible incident.</i>

1155
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,990
Forty-five hundred meters,
dropping fast.

1156
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:34,658
Ninety seconds to impact.

1157
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:37,577
Can you tell me straight, Nesbit,
can he do it?

1158
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:41,248
Only a complete genius
or a total fool could pull this off.

1159
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:43,791
Lucky for us he's both.

1160
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,592
Any power yet, Bill?

1161
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,802
I got nothing.
We're in a flat spin.

1162
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,228
Randall, this would be
a terrific time to fix that!

1163
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,188
Any time now would be good!

1164
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,067
60 seconds to impact.
System's still red.

1165
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:10,402
We've established audio link.

1166
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,113
Fred?
Fred, can you hear me?

1167
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:17,242
Bud... I'm down below.
Everything's spinning.

1168
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:20,162
<i>- I don't know what to do!
- Focus, Fred.</i>

1169
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,832
It's like in training.
The rotating chair with the wires.

1170
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,752
- That was a real winner!
- You can do <i>this.</i>

1171
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:28,587
Trust your instincts.

1172
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,217
NQW!

1173
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:41,016
Fred, come on! You can do it.

1174
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,685
Thirty seconds!
Don't give up, Fred!

1175
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:44,978
Come on, Fred!

1176
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,443
Gotta close the circuit.

1177
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,492
- Come on, Fred.
- Fifteen seconds to impact.

1178
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:01,661
Need something decent.

1179
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,622
You're the man, Fred!

1180
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,625
- Come on.
- Ten seconds!

1181
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,670
- Bud's coin!
- Come on!

1182
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,218
Yee-haa!

1183
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,554
<i>L</i> 90f power!

1184
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,185
You did it, Fred!

1185
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,896
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1186
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,611
<i>Put on the porch light, Mama!
We're comin' home!</i>

1187
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:55,089
<i>Oh, Magoo.
You've done it again, sir!</i>

1188
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,607
That little space rock's gonna make you
real famous, Julie Ford.

1189
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,402
So, what's next for you, rocketman?

1190
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:21,195
Well, actually, I was thinking
about asking you to dance.

1191
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,913
Oh, well. Thanks anyway but I think
we've done that before.

1192
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:31,126
Wait a second, I had a little time
on my hands recently,

1193
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:32,502
and I've been practicing.

1194
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:36,547
That and I got a little bit creative
with the space blankets.

1195
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:07,533
<i>When you wish upon</i> a <i>star</i>

1196
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,916
<i>Makes no difference who you are</i>

1197
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:16,630
<i>Anything your heart desires</i>

1198
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:21,176
<i>Will come to you</i>

1199
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:31,182
<i>Like</i> a <i>bolt out of the blue</i>

1200
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,647
<i>Fate steps in</i>

01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:39,398
<i>And sees you through</i>

01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,489

<i>True</i>

1207
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,257
Sweet dreams, lovebirds.

1208
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,136
So, I guess I'll see you
in eight months.

1209
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,514
Goodnight, Fred.

1210
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,156
It's a tale as old as time, Ulysses.

1211
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,283
Boy meets girl.

1212
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,328
Boy falls for girl.

1213
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:32,998
Boy and girl return to home planet,

1214
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,875
get a nice little house
with a white picket fence

1215
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,126
and live happily...

1216
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:38,419
No!

1217
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:43,545
<i>No, not again! Ulysses! No!</i>
