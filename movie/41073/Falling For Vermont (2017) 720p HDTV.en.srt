1
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,144
Yeah, no.

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,646
I know, Brad.

3
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,815
Okay.

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,685
I know, Brad,
I'll be there at 9:00 sharp.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,686
Oh, don't worry,

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,755
the studio sent over a suit
for me to wear.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,157
I guess they didn't trust
my fashion sense.

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,360
Yes, I know what a big deal
this is for us.

9
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,498
No, I won't forget
the signed movie poster.

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,766
I will see you later.

11
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:34,867
Okay, bye.

12
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,346
Angela Young?

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,580
Yes, that's me.

14
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,251
Thank you.

15
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,889
Headed to
the Book Expo?

16
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,590
Yes, I'm an author.

17
00:00:58,626 --> 00:00:59,558
Oh, great.

18
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,492
Anything I'd have heard of?

19
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,261
It's a book series
called "Time Visitor."

20
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,862
They just turned it
into a movie.

21
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,098
Congratulations
on all your success.

22
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,299
Thank you so much.

23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,503
Now all I need is some time
in my schedule to enjoy it.

24
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,218
Are they all
here for you?

25
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,953
Oh, I doubt it.

26
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:28,988
Oh, there's my sister.

27
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,222
I can let myself out.

28
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,323
Okay.

29
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,291
Hey, thank you again.

30
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,292
Have a great weekend.

31
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,327
Thanks, you too.

32
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,527
Thank you.

33
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,098
Hey.

34
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,133
Sorry I'm late.

35
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,066
It's okay,
I'm used to it.

36
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,067
Take this.

37
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,103
Okay.

38
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,403
Ready?
Let's do this.

39
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,871
Yeah.

40
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,773
When did you get here?

41
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,074
About a half hour ago,

42
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,042
I had to drop off
some books

43
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,844
at the TV studio
for your interview later,

44
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,479
and I just
left my car there

45
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,080
and took a cab
over here.

46
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,293
Have I ever told you
you're a great assistant?

47
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,850
About a hundred times.

48
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:58,817
But you can always
say it again.

49
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,121
Oh, my God, wow,
you look amazing.

50
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,422
Oh, can you believe this?

51
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,691
I think this suit
costs more than my car.

52
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,970
Well, you're practically
a celebrity these days.

53
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,793
You've gotta look the part.

54
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,928
How's Brad?

55
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,830
Is he in full
control-freak mode yet?

56
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,499
Yeah, but
that's nothing new.

57
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,766
How are you feeling?

58
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,702
Yeah, you know,
I'm-I'm a little nervous.

59
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,870
Yeah.

60
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,338
Actually, I'm a lot nervous.

61
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,784
The hype behind the movie
is pretty crazy, huh?

62
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,773
Yeah.

63
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,675
I think this is about
to be your new normal.

64
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,514
Aw...

65
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,282
I love your costume.

66
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,318
Athena's my favorite character
in the whole world.

67
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,386
Really?

68
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,954
What do you like most about her?

69
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,990
She's not afraid of anything.

70
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,658
Exactly.

71
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,627
I wish I had her confidence
right about now.

72
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,861
Have fun today, okay?

73
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:43,897
Bye.

74
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,065
Oh, so cute...

75
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,668
Okay, so, uh,
we're here till 11:00,

76
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,137
then at 12:00, you've got
your radio interviews.

77
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,873
3:00, you are pre-taping
for<i> Beantown Today,</i>

78
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:55,807
and then at 6:00,

79
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,521
you and Brad are hopping
on a flight to L.A.

80
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,022
for your big movie premiere
tomorrow night.

81
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,846
Gee, is that all?

82
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,159
I really wish you were coming
with us to Los Angeles.

83
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,148
I know,

84
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,417
but I've got that wedding
to go to on Saturday.

85
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,730
Yeah, I just can't imagine
surviving a red carpet

86
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,053
without you.

87
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,721
I can't do this...

88
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,023
Oh, no, you don't.

89
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,024
What? I just need some air,

90
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,091
and some coffee,

91
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,893
and probably
some more sleep.

92
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,072
I promise I'll be right back.

93
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,196
Uh, yeah, right,

94
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,875
you always try to run
every time you feel overwhelmed.

95
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:19,943
You've been doing it
since we were kids.

96
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,868
Come on, I'm a writer,
I didn't sign up for this.

97
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:23,903
Writing is the hard part.

98
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,270
This is supposed to be fun.

99
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,449
Oh, really?
You wanna trade places?

100
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,706
Not a chance.

101
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,907
But don't worry,

102
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,220
I'll be at the back
of the theatre

103
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,877
watching the entire time.

104
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,113
Take me to my happy place,
take to my happy place...

105
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:39,051
take me
to my happy place.

106
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,762
All right, little man,

107
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,398
looks to me like you are gonna
get to keep those tonsils.

108
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,733
What do you think
of that?

109
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,734
Is that a good thing?

110
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,737
Is he going
to be okay, Doctor?

111
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,739
He is gonna be just fine.

112
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,976
So, his glands
are a little swollen,

113
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,143
his throat's
still inflamed,

114
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,256
but he should be good
by next week.

115
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Thank you.

116
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,146
You're welcome.

117
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,315
Quinn, what do you say
to Dr. Callan?

118
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,317
Thank you, Dr. Cow-man.

119
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,786
You're welcome, cowboy.

120
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,722
Whoa, look at
all that wax in your ear.

121
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,556
Let me get that.

122
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,591
What?

123
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,892
Thank you.

124
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,561
You're welcome.

125
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,596
Okay, see you later.

126
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,936
Hey, guys.

127
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,571
Good morning, sweetheart.

128
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,150
Did you guys have fun
with Nana this morning?

129
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,274
Yeah, it was good.

130
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,910
We went blueberry picking,
and then we made pancakes.

131
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:39,990
What? That sounds like
the perfect start

132
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,513
to the most
perfect day ever.

133
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,282
What about you,
Emily?

134
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,283
What?

135
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,284
Oh, sorry.

136
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,685
Yeah, it was fun.

137
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,420
Alex ate, like,
40 pancakes.

138
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,155
We're going to go
to the bookstore.

139
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,023
Come on, Alex.

140
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,024
Bye, Nana!

141
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,059
Bye, dear.

142
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,330
Wow, do you remember

143
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,010
when she used to ask
permission to go someplace?

144
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,100
Now she just
kind of tells me.

145
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,303
She's growing up,
finding her voice.

146
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,837
Before you know it,
she'll be dating.

147
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:06,638
For some topics,

148
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,018
I prefer to keep
my head in the sand

149
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:08,874
if that's okay with you.

150
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,709
Jeff...

151
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,778
Emily needs
someone younger

152
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,613
who can relate to her
better than I can.

153
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,683
And, more importantly,
you need someone.

154
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,885
Thank you so much
for worrying about me.

155
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,021
I should probably go
check on the kids,

156
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,338
make sure they're not getting
into any trouble down there.

157
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,831
Making yourself
comfortable, I see.

158
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,801
What's on the Callan Family
best-seller list?

159
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,070
I'm reading
a Japanese comic book.

160
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,137
Cool.

161
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,074
Emily, how about you?

162
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,709
The new book
in the Time Visitor series.

163
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,245
I've told you
about it, Dad.

164
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,848
It's about a girl named Athena
who can travel through time.

165
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,982
She's totally amazing.

166
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,517
Cool.

167
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,188
Time-traveling teens?

168
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,758
Who comes up with this stuff?

169
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,671
<i>When the world needed a hero,</i>

170
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,362
<i>Athena would be that hero...</i>

171
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,163
<i>Go!</i>

172
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,737
<i>Athena, it's a superstorm,</i>

173
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:12,916
<i>you've gotta get us outta here!</i>

174
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,050
<i>I'm trying, but the crystal
isn't working!</i>

175
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,040
<i>Well, you'd better
figure something out,</i>

176
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:15,841
<i>because we don't have
much time!</i>

177
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,220
Hey, sorry I'm late,

178
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,733
I got stuck on a call
with the film studio.

179
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,189
You look great.

180
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:31,990
Look at this!

181
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,525
The audience
is loving the movie.

182
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,594
Yeah... I'm kinda
freaking out, Brad.

183
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,028
Are you kidding me?

184
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,475
I always said you were
going to be a big star,

185
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,532
and now it is
actually happening.

186
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,644
Okay, I need Boyfriend Brad
right now, not Manager Brad.

187
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,634
Stop...

188
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,713
Aw, come on, I just need
a little more content

189
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,703
for the website.

190
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,670
Put it down...

191
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:46,750
Okay, phone's going away,
phone's going away.

192
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,906
It's just me and you.

193
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,709
Listen, you've worked so hard
to get to this moment, okay?

194
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,210
All you have to do
is go out there

195
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,645
and be yourself.

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,046
Be funny, be charming,

197
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,548
be... you.

198
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,116
Yeah, well, I'd feel
a lot more like me

199
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,285
if I were behind a laptop

200
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,586
in a coffee shop,

201
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,989
not in front of 400 people
on a stage.

202
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:04,956
You know what, maybe
you just need some food

203
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:05,992
to calm your nerves.

204
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,093
Here, I've got some nuts.

205
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,562
These are delicious.

206
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,908
Brad, how long
have we been dating?

207
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,331
- Hmm?
- I'm allergic to nuts!

208
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,900
- What? Really?
- Yes, Brad.

209
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,134
My throat closes up,

210
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,180
and I just break
into hives.

211
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,336
Ew, that is not
a good look.

212
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,573
Okay, no nuts.
Good to know.

213
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,808
<i>Well, as you know,</i>

214
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,610
<i>we have a very special guest
for you right now.</i>

215
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,079
<i>The author
of the "Time Visitor" books,</i>

216
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,448
<i>Angela Young!</i>

217
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,317
Go get 'em, slugger.

218
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,062
She's got this.

219
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,366
Oh, wow, that is
seriously bright.

220
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,103
Please tell me
there are no more interviews.

221
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,683
Okay, I got a call from
<i>Good Morning America,</i>

222
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,873
and they'd love
to have her

223
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,174
the Tuesday
after the premiere.

224
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,108
No, no, no, no.
No can do.

225
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,043
We've got the opening

226
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,189
of the Time Visitor
pop-up store in Chicago

227
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,213
on Tuesday.

228
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,146
Can they do Wednesday?

229
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,848
Brad, you're supposed
to be on a flight

230
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,815
to Beijing
on Thursday

231
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,851
for the next premiere.

232
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,184
Yeah, I know.
We'll make it work.

233
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,186
She's going to be
really jetlagged.

234
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,120
Hey, we can all rest

235
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,700
after the movie makes
a $100 million, okay?

236
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,656
The better
the movie does,

237
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,058
the more books
we sell, right?

238
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:13,892
Hang on, I gotta grab this.

239
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:14,826
Go for Brad.

240
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,194
Do you remember

241
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,864
when we went canoeing
in Nantucket last fall?

242
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,466
I wish we could
do that again.

243
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,334
Hey, I got it!

244
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,735
Why don't we rent a canoe,

245
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,303
just for a few hours?

246
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,805
Aw, I'm sorry, honey,

247
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,708
You go live on<i> Beantown</i>
in less than an hour.

248
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:30,976
Right.

249
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,844
Okay, the most beautiful
season of the year,

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,912
and I get to see it all

251
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,547
through the limousine window.

252
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,482
You guys aren't
going to believe this.

253
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,028
We just closed the deal
for three more books!

254
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,052
What?

255
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,887
Three more books?

256
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,399
Three? I mean,
how could you not tell me

257
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,467
this deal was in the works?

258
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,869
Listen, I didn't want
to bother you with the details

259
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,058
because I had no idea

260
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,527
the deal would
close this quickly.

261
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,828
Did you know
about this?

262
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,163
I swear, I just found out
when you did.

263
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,199
Congratulations?

264
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,233
Am I missing
something?

265
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,133
I thought
you'd be excited.

266
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,202
Brad, "Time Visitor"
was supposed to be

267
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,436
a three-book series.

268
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,871
Athena's story is over.

269
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,039
I want to tell new stories.

270
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,074
I get that, but, honey,

271
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,219
your publishers
are giving you

272
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,943
a gigantic bonus.

273
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,413
Yes, but it's not about
the money for me, Brad.

274
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,926
I started writing because
I loved telling stories

275
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,716
that would inspire
young people.

276
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,085
But now all I do lately
is go to meetings

277
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,587
about Athena apps
and video games.

278
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,622
And theme parks,

279
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,256
don't forget the theme parks.

280
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,190
Kidding, kidding.

281
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,060
Look, I understand
it's overwhelming, okay?

282
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,129
But come on, this is
every author's dream.

283
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,731
No, Brad,
this is your dream.

284
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,044
Look, how am I even
supposed to be inspired

285
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:28,800
to write something new

286
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,602
when all I do is
go to interviews?

287
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,237
Do you want, like,
a cup of tea, Ange?

288
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,405
No.

289
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
No, I don't want a tea.

290
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,475
I want a break.

291
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,944
For a week.

292
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,779
Okay, just even
for a few days.

293
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,280
I want to see foliage,

294
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,281
I want to go apple picking,

295
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,382
I want to
carve a pumpkin!

296
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,452
It's fall, you guys!

297
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,087
Hey, I love
apple picking, too.

298
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:49,888
I get it,

299
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,057
and I understand
that you're tired,

300
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,736
but we have to strike
while the iron is hot.

301
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,505
Well, that's not the answer
I was looking for.

302
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,295
Hi, Ms. Young,
we need you on set.

303
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,397
Thank you.

304
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,366
Ange, listen.

305
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,079
Okay, look, I am not happy
if you're not happy.

306
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,169
So, talk to me,

307
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,136
what can I do
to make you feel better?

308
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,137
Be spontaneous.

309
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,606
Just this once.

310
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,007
Run away with me
for the weekend.

311
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,241
We can go
to the Berkshires.

312
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,110
No cell phones,
no computers?

313
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,778
What do you say?

314
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,447
Let's do it.

315
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,815
Really?

316
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,850
Sure, why not?

317
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,919
You don't mean today?

318
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,354
Honey, we have
the movie premiere

319
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,155
in L.A. tomorrow night.
We can't miss that.

320
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,458
Right, the movie premiere.

321
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,325
Look, I promise you,

322
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,927
we'll take a trip
after the holidays.

323
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,861
But for now,
all you have to do

324
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,763
is go out there,
do this one last interview,

325
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,264
and we are out of here, okay?

326
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,101
You got this.

327
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,136
You're great.

328
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,479
- Hi.
- Hi.

329
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,480
Nice to meet you.

330
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,515
Nice to meet you, too.

331
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,821
Thank you.

332
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,826
Okay, everyone,
five minutes to air.

333
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,765
Oh, sorry.

334
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,535
Yeah, go for Brad.

335
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,370
Oh, Jennifer,
how are you?

336
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:16,041
Yes, very exciting,
I know, I know...

337
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,110
Okay, we are in L.A.,
so we can make that work...

338
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,181
No, no, Angela
is totally available

339
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,350
and very interested...

340
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,919
Right.

341
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:28,820
That's great,

342
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,855
we wanted to talk
with the guys over there

343
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:31,656
about merchandising.

344
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,224
The dolls were great,
we loved them.

345
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,826
A couple
little changes...

346
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,396
Yeah, just
some little things,

347
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,399
but it's all very exciting,

348
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,001
and Angela is
very much on board.

349
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,839
The amusement park?
Great idea, uh-huh.

350
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,514
I was thinking about
the roller coaster...

351
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,457
Excuse me, I was looking
for that woman

352
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,714
I saw you with
earlier today,

353
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,382
the one with
the blue Pontiac

354
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,184
parked in
the tow-away zone?

355
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,585
It's about to get towed.

356
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,686
Oh, okay, no problem.

357
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,722
It's my sister.

358
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,067
I'm actually headed out
to move it right now.

359
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,091
Thank you.

360
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,860
What? I'm sorry, what?

361
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,895
Just a second.

362
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,609
Have you seen Ms. Young?
We go live in two minutes.

363
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,066
What are you talking about?

364
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,102
She was sitting on set
like, a second ago.

365
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,703
Control room,
our guest is M.I.A.,

366
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,904
we're gonna need
to pinch hit.

367
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,239
What's going on?
Where is Angela?

368
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,207
She pulled
a disappearing act,

369
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,242
is where she is.

370
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,276
What?

371
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,644
Angela? Ange!

372
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,246
Angela!

373
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,149
Ange, they need you on set,
like, right this second.

374
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,051
I am dialing her cell.

375
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,560
Well, wherever she is,
she's not answering.

376
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,629
Maybe she went out for a walk?

377
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,164
Yeah, more like
a long drive.

378
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,477
<i>Sorry,</i>

379
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,100
<i>I just needed time to myself.</i>

380
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,580
<i>Don't worry, I'm fine.
I took Cynthia's car.</i>

381
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,936
Oh, what is
she thinking...

382
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,673
Well, well, Vermont,

383
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,175
it's nice to see you again,

384
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,144
I'm Angela. I'm an Aries.

385
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,945
I like Audrey Hepburn films,

386
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,281
and, uh, salt water taffy,

387
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,517
and talking to myself.

388
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,125
However, I'm not too crazy
about this rain,

389
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,795
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd just... lay off.

390
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,266
Come on, Vermont,
work with me.

391
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,301
It's been a beautiful drive
up until now.

392
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,637
Ooh, wow...

393
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,105
That's bright.

394
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,607
Whoa!

395
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,167
Uh... ma'am?

396
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,670
Excuse me, ma'am?

397
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,705
Are you okay?

398
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,839
Me?

399
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,342
I'm fine.

400
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,146
I'm Kevin Gaines,
the town sheriff.

401
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,215
Uh, what's your name?

402
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,518
My name?

403
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,358
I have no idea.

404
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,165
It's okay,
take it easy.

405
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,266
What happened?

406
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,669
You were in
some sort of accident,

407
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,072
but you don't need
to worry, okay?

408
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,039
I'm a doctor,

409
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,686
in case the lab coat
didn't give that away.

410
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,009
Dr. Callan.

411
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,778
Yes.

412
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,413
How did you... know that?

413
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,882
Your name is on your coat.

414
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,751
Yes, it is.

415
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,719
Glad to see

416
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,921
the cognitive skills are
working, that's good.

417
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,389
Where am I?

418
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,092
Well, you are in Hopedale,

419
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,127
in the fine state of Vermont.

420
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,596
I've never heard of Hopedale.

421
00:14:58,632 --> 00:14:59,564
I didn't think so.

422
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,466
I'm the only doctor
here in this small town,

423
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,945
I figured we would have
crossed paths by now.

424
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,370
Listen, more
importantly,

425
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,538
can you tell me anything
about yourself?

426
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,742
No.

427
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,210
Hmm.

428
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,278
It's too bad

429
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,193
your name wasn't embroidered
on your shirt, huh?

430
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,717
Sorry, that was a bad joke.

431
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,586
Do you have any idea
what's going on with me?

432
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,987
Why can't I remember anything?

433
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,066
Okay, well,
I don't know right now,

434
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,723
but I'm going to guess

435
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,092
that judging from
the little cut on your head,

436
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,327
that you've suffered

437
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,896
some sort of post-traumatic
memory loss.

438
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,064
Now, it's okay,
don't panic.

439
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,766
You didn't have a concussion,

440
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,935
and the memory loss normally
doesn't last that long.

441
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,469
I should have had a purse,

442
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,904
some sort of I.D...

443
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,172
Um, oh, a phone.

444
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,408
We can go
to my recent calls...

445
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,620
You didn't have a bag
or a phone

446
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:45,755
when I found you
this morning.

447
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,178
Just the clothes
you were wearing.

448
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,147
Hello again.

449
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,682
I'm the sheriff.
We met earlier.

450
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,850
Yes, I-I remember that.

451
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:53,818
Thank you for your help
this morning.

452
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,320
No problem.

453
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,601
Listen, if there's anybody
out there looking for you,

454
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,625
Kevin will find them.

455
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,859
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

456
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:02,895
I will be back, okay?

457
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,766
I thought
this kind of thing

458
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,034
only happened
in the movies.

459
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,103
Nope, it's a real thing,
all right.

460
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,706
But as I mentioned to her,
it shouldn't last that long.

461
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,607
So you have no idea
where she's from?

462
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,609
Unfortunately, no.

463
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,478
No one's been reported
missing in the area.

464
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,412
Hmm.

465
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,514
It's like she just
dropped out of the sky

466
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,550
into our little town.

467
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,584
Wow.

468
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,396
Guess you've got
your work cut out for you, huh?

469
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,553
Yeah.

470
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,132
Actually, you mind if I ask her
a few more questions?

471
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,557
You know, she's actually
been through a lot.

472
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,993
Let's just leave it
for now.

473
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,627
Whatever you say, doc.

474
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,996
In the meantime,

475
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:38,997
I'll go file
a missing person's report

476
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,198
and see what we can find.

477
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,065
Okay, I'll see you later.

478
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,500
All right.

479
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:48,973
Hey.

480
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,042
Hi.

481
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:51,909
I don't understand.

482
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,911
I know who
all these celebrities are,

483
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,748
but I can't remember a single
detail about my life?

484
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,916
You are gonna be
just fine, all right?

485
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,232
Your memory will come back soon.

486
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,320
How long is soon?

487
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,322
Well, best-case scenario,
a day or two.

488
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,590
Worst-case scenario?

489
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,658
Well, uh... could be a week?

490
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,893
A week?

491
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:09,894
Okay, don't get upset.

492
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,540
You're only going
to make it worse, all right?

493
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,531
I just need you to relax.

494
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,767
Okay, okay,
so what-what happens next?

495
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,769
Do I, um...

496
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:18,870
do I get a cast?
A sling?

497
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:19,871
Did you break anything?

498
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,672
I don't think so.

499
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,741
Okay, then... no?

500
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,209
Oh.

501
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,344
Tell you what, uh...

502
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,881
Want a lollipop?

503
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,850
Thanks.

504
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,752
Look, I was just going
to get you...

505
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,220
some scrubs

506
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,622
that you can change into,

507
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,689
if you like.

508
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,124
I hope the shoes fit.

509
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,426
They're my nurse's.

510
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,330
I'll leave you with that, okay?

511
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:49,968
Oh, actually,

512
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,969
what should I call you?

513
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,071
Huh?

514
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,072
I was thinking that

515
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,873
we should probably
give you a name, you know.

516
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,575
Oh, right, uh...

517
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,077
Yeah, that makes sense.

518
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,112
Cheryl.

519
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,746
Does that work?

520
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:02,880
Uh...

521
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,083
I don't really feel like
a Cheryl.

522
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,418
Hmm. Um...

523
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,464
this is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

524
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,221
How about...

525
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,589
How about Elizabeth?

526
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,091
Elizabeth.

527
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,892
It's nice to meet you.

528
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,368
Pleased to meet you, too,
Dr. Callan.

529
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,466
Take your time.

530
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,977
Not only
do I feel strange,

531
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,046
but now I look
strange as well.

532
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,448
I promise I won't tell
my nurse you said that.

533
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,028
Oh, right, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to imply...

534
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,985
I'm kidding,
sorry, I was kidding.

535
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,220
There was a reason

536
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,365
I wanted to bring you
into town

537
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,722
so soon after
your injury, though.

538
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,190
The quicker that
we can expose you

539
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,525
to images
you may recognize,

540
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,527
the faster your memory
will return.

541
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,895
So, what do you think?

542
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,829
Look around,
what do you see?

543
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,531
Does anything
ring a bell?

544
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,234
Uh, I see
a post office.

545
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,302
A gazebo.

546
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,037
A banner that says
"Fall Fest,"

547
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,183
but nothing's
ringing a bell.

548
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,208
Okay, stop for a sec,

549
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,343
take a deep breath.

550
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,712
Close your eyes.

551
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,014
What do you smell?

552
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,685
I think I smell apple pie,

553
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,821
cinnamon,

554
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,891
and... a fire

555
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,125
burning off in the distance.

556
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,395
That's...

557
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,997
that's good.

558
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,498
Does that remind you
of anything?

559
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,333
Yeah. My mother.

560
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,502
I don't remember much,

561
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,705
but I know she used to
bake pies this time of year.

562
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,474
That's good.

563
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,210
You feel better?

564
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,111
Yeah, a little.

565
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,045
Thanks.

566
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,380
You bet.

567
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,415
Hey, Jimmy!

568
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,549
You need a hand
with that?

569
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,716
Oh, nah,

570
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,062
this is about as close as I get
to the gym these days.

571
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,020
Hey there.

572
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:49,954
Jimmy Daniels.

573
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,088
I'd shake your hand,

574
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,524
but I'm afraid these boxes
wouldn't survive the fall.

575
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,738
Nice to meet you.
My name is...

576
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,727
Elizabeth.

577
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,628
Elizabeth, right.

578
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,863
Uh...

579
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,198
Is this your store?

580
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,532
Sure is.

581
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:02,711
The Bookery has been
in my family

582
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,268
for over 70 years.

583
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,070
Wanna come in, look around?

584
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,283
Know what, we're just
gonna head to the diner,

585
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,206
but we'll come back after.

586
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,209
Ah, well, feel free
to drop by anytime.

587
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,376
Good to meet you,
Elizabeth.

588
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,412
Nice to meet you.

589
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,781
Everybody seems
so friendly around here.

590
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,417
That's small-town
living for you.

591
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,953
It's nice.

592
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,221
It is.

593
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,592
Can I get you a coffee?

594
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,261
You're really comfortable
around here, huh?

595
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,128
First job I ever had

596
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,064
was right here
at my parents' diner.

597
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,665
Actually, that gazebo
you saw earlier,

598
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,267
that's where
they got married.

599
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,368
The post office you saw,

600
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,605
that's where I found out
I got into medical school.

601
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,405
Yeah, you can say

602
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,407
I know my way
around this place.

603
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,709
Come sit down.

604
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,144
Let's sit here.

605
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,315
You can get some food
if you want.

606
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,783
Hi, honey.

607
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,253
Oh, hello.

608
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,254
Make yourselves
comfortable.

609
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,322
Elizabeth, these are
my parents, Bob and Jane.

610
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,323
This is Elizabeth.

611
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,758
Uh, hi.
How are you?

612
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:01,759
Hi, sweetheart.

613
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,760
So where are you from?

614
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,762
Oh, actually,
your son and I

615
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,664
are both trying to figure
that out right now.

616
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,665
Yeah, Elizabeth
is having

617
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,499
a little trouble
with her memory.

618
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,534
Sheriff Gaines found her
walking alone

619
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,814
on the highway this morning,
all by herself.

620
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,449
And you can't remember
anything before that?

621
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:14,839
Nope.

622
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,406
So, where are you
planning to stay

623
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,774
while you're in town?

624
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,211
Oh, I hadn't even
thought about that.

625
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,446
Is there a hotel
or something nearby?

626
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,482
Oh, I'm afraid our hotel
is full of tourists

627
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,517
this time of year.

628
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,020
But don't be silly,
you can stay with Jeff.

629
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,988
- She can?
- Sure.

630
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,067
You've got that
beautiful guest house

631
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,457
that never gets used.

632
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,358
Oh, no, I wouldn't
want to impose on you

633
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,693
and on your family.

634
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:36,994
It's just Jeff
and the kids.

635
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,462
It's no trouble
at all.

636
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,463
No.

637
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,564
You know what,

638
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,033
that's probably
not such a bad idea.

639
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,068
A head injury,
you know,

640
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,035
I can keep
my eye on you.

641
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,506
As long as it's not
an imposition, then sure.

642
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,684
Sorry about this,

643
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,996
the kids were supposed
to be here by now.

644
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,820
Oh, that's okay.
I don't mind waiting.

645
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,188
Hi, Dad.

646
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,423
Hey, guys.

647
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,324
Where have you been?

648
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,591
Fishing on the dock.

649
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,593
I caught four,
all by myself.

650
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,995
That's impressive, Alex,

651
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,574
but that's not an excuse
for being late, right?

652
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,332
Uh, Dad, you do know

653
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,067
there's a woman
sitting in our truck.

654
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,736
Don't mind him.

655
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,837
Hi, I'm Emily.

656
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,272
Do you work with my Dad?

657
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,106
Guys, this is
Elizabeth, all right?

658
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,841
She's a patient of mine,

659
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,742
she's going to be
staying with us

660
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:25,710
for a little while.

661
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,644
In our house?

662
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,046
Well, she's gonna be
in the guest house.

663
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:30,959
She's having a difficult time
remembering some things,

664
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,018
and we are going
to help her.

665
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,753
- Okay?
- Okay.

666
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,757
So, you lost
your memory?

667
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,392
That's incredible.

668
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,893
Well, I'll tell you what,

669
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,729
it doesn't feel
very incredible right now.

670
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,698
Emily, how was your day?

671
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,400
Pretty good.

672
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,869
I got picked to write
a one-act play for Fall Fest.

673
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,703
It's not a big deal.

674
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:53,804
What?

675
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,772
Come on, are you kidding me?

676
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,040
That's a huge deal.

677
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,808
Congrats, honey.

678
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,077
Fall Fest is all-day
celebration of the season.

679
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:00,945
We have it every year

680
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,380
to raise money
for the kids' school.

681
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,315
It's pretty awesome.

682
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,951
There's games,
every kind of food imaginable.

683
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,487
And there's a really cool
ferris wheel.

684
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:10,287
Wow, that
sounds great.

685
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,123
Favorite day
of the fall, right kids?

686
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,057
Yup.

687
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:13,858
And you got picked

688
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,760
to put up a play
for the entire town?

689
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:16,660
Yeah, but I'm worried

690
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,662
since I only have
two weeks to write it.

691
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,409
Well, I'm sure you'll
rise up to the challenge.

692
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,899
You should come

693
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,112
if you're still here
for Fall Fest.

694
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,168
Honey,

695
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,302
that's 12 days from now.

696
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:28,739
Yeah, I mean, as much as
I would love to see your play,

697
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:29,607
I'm pretty sure my memory
will have be back,

698
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,574
and I'll be home.

699
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,076
Okay.

700
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,383
Home sweet home.

701
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,688
I'm gonna go
empty the dishwasher.

702
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,158
I'm gonna go
clean my room.

703
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,426
Okay.

704
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,163
I thought kids were supposed
to hate doing their chores.

705
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,297
Oh, don't be fooled.

706
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,633
They're only doing it
to get today's Wi-Fi password.

707
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,135
I change it every day

708
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,671
and give it to them
once they finish their chores.

709
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,007
Wow, that seems brilliant
and disturbing

710
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,109
all at the same time.

711
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,218
Yeah, it's not easy raising
two kids on your own, so...

712
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,520
I hope Alex wasn't
bothering you

713
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,721
with his
third degree earlier.

714
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:18,789
Oh, no, of course not.

715
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,459
I mean, I'm a strange woman
in hospital scrubs.

716
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,395
I'd be curious, too.

717
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,630
Yeah, their mom
passed away

718
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,531
a few years ago,

719
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,301
so he gets a little
overprotective of me.

720
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,471
Yeah, of course.

721
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,372
That makes sense.

722
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,674
I'm sorry about your wife.

723
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,375
Thanks.

724
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,711
Here, let me show you around.

725
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,015
Wait, hold on
a second.

726
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,984
What is this?

727
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,019
Oh...

728
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,156
You have a canoe?

729
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,524
I do.

730
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,192
It used to be my grandfather's.

731
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,661
Unfortunately, I've neglected
her over the years, though.

732
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,763
I don't understand,

733
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,600
your kids do their chores
when they're supposed to.

734
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,069
Your property seems
meticulously organized,

735
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,270
and yet you have

736
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:09,773
this amazing 1930
Sullivan Model D

737
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,742
just sitting here
in disrepair?

738
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,578
How do you know so much
about canoes?

739
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:16,914
Oh.

740
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,182
You know what, I...

741
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,417
I have no idea.

742
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,730
That's probably
a good sign, right?

743
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,553
It is a good sign.

744
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:23,554
It'd be a great sign

745
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,967
if you could connect it
to actual memories.

746
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,191
But if you continue
to have those,

747
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,893
your memory will be back
in no time.

748
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,762
Okay, well, at least
I'm starting

749
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,097
with the really
important stuff,

750
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,532
like old canoes.

751
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,134
Come on, let me
show you around.

752
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,202
Okay.

753
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,054
Sorry if it's a little
dusty in here.

754
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,412
We don't get many guests, but...

755
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,281
No, it's lovely.

756
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,448
Thank you.

757
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,152
I think I can take it
from here, Dad.

758
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,855
Okay, great,
she's all yours.

759
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,103
You know, you can join us
for dinner tonight,

760
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,528
or if you're too tired,
you can just go to sleep.

761
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,265
Wow, he's even weirder
than usual.

762
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,341
It's nice having you here.

763
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,101
The only other girl
that comes over

764
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:11,969
is my Aunt Linda,

765
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,671
but she always tries
to take me shopping

766
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,339
for dresses and makeup,

767
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,675
and I don't really care
about that stuff.

768
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,577
What kind of stuff
are you into?

769
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,778
I love books.

770
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,279
Fiction mostly.

771
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,325
Oh, so you must spend
a lot of time

772
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,426
in that bookstore
I saw in town.

773
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,583
Are you kidding,

774
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,351
it's like one of
my favorite places.

775
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,530
Maybe we can go
before you leave.

776
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:29,620
Yeah.

777
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,755
Yeah, that'd be great.

778
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,759
Okay, that's my cue.

779
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,194
See you in the morning.

780
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,629
Thank you.

781
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,333
Bye.

782
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,661
<i>You have almost reached
Angela Young.</i>

783
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,074
<i>Please leave a message,
and I will call you back.</i>

784
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,408
Cynthia, that's,
like, the fifth time

785
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:14,298
you've tried calling her

786
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:14,932
since she left town
a couple days ago.

787
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,200
Aren't you
the one who said

788
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,235
she'd contact us

789
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,235
when she's ready
to come home

790
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,670
like she always does?

791
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,537
No, you're right.

792
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:22,339
I just wanted
to make sure she's okay.

793
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:25,309
I still can't believe
she decided to take a vacation

794
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,655
the day before
the movie premiere.

795
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,711
You know Angela.

796
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,424
That's what she does
when she gets stressed out.

797
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,048
But look
on the bright-side,

798
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,494
you can always look forward
to attending the sequel

799
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,317
in a couple years.

800
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,186
Well, I do like
the sound of that.

801
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,522
So, where do you think
she went this time?

802
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,324
Ooh, if I had to guess,

803
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,359
I'd say she's hiding out
at some spa resort

804
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,527
on the Cape somewhere.

805
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,674
You know, anything to forget
her real life for a while.

806
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,098
Well, it's a good thing
she's got us

807
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,499
to keep her real life going.

808
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:51,869
Are you sure
I can't help?

809
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,103
Nope.

810
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,449
I think I got it
all covered here,

811
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,840
so you go ahead
and sit down, all right?

812
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,915
Hey, Elizabeth, would you like
to play a game later?

813
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,061
We have a whole
closet of 'em.

814
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,551
Dad has to go

815
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,552
to a Town Hall meeting,

816
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,054
so he can't play with us.

817
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,257
You guys, Elizabeth has had
a rough couple days,

818
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,859
so we are going to let her
get some rest, okay?

819
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,228
Actually, you'd be amazed
what 10 hours of sleep

820
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,296
can do for you.

821
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,098
Okay, well, that's
good to hear.

822
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,901
All right, pancakes!

823
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,602
This is one of
my favorite dishes, right?

824
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:26,904
Dad, isn't this

825
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,073
the only dish
you know how to cook?

826
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,441
Okay, come on, you guys.

827
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,276
I'm sure I'll love it.

828
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,577
I'm starving.

829
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:34,645
Can I eat three?

830
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,913
Elizabeth gets
first serving.

831
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,614
She's our guest.

832
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,284
- That's right.
- Thank you, Emily.

833
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,963
Are you going to wear
the same hospital clothes

834
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,654
the entire time?

835
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,422
There called scrubs,
right, Dad?

836
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,423
Yes, they are.

837
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,524
I promise,

838
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,720
I'm going to get new clothes
the minute I get a chance.

839
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,963
You know something,

840
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,899
I'd really like to join you
to that Town Hall meeting,

841
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,067
if that's okay.

842
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,969
Uh, okay,
I mean, I was thinking

843
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,449
you might need a little
more rest today, though.

844
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:01,905
Oh, any more rest,

845
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,540
and I'll never get out
of that bed.

846
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,748
Now, last thing,

847
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,383
the pumpkin-carving
competition.

848
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,430
We still need volunteers
for registration and judging.

849
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:16,420
Sign me up,

850
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:17,521
and Bob, too.

851
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,623
I thought we were taking it
easy this year, Janie.

852
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,258
When you rest,
you rust.

853
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,894
Your mom's
a real spitfire.

854
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,195
You have no idea.

855
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,930
Okay, shifting
to new business...

856
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,398
Jeffrey,
why don't you start?

857
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,868
Yeah, thank you.

858
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,269
Hey, everyone,

859
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,815
I'm sure most of you
have heard by now,

860
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,039
that we have
a new visitor in town.

861
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,243
I'd like you to say hello
to Elizabeth, please.

862
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,047
Now, she's having some
trouble with her memory.

863
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,293
We hope it's going
to come back soon,

864
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,895
but in the meantime,
Sheriff Gaines and I

865
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,786
were hoping
that everybody here

866
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:49,898
could help us cast
a wider net.

867
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:50,922
That's right.

868
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,634
I've been in touch with
the other departments

869
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:53,323
from the surrounding area,

870
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,392
but nothing's
come up yet.

871
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,060
Which is where
you guys come in.

872
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:59,997
I have a couple thousand
Instagram followers.

873
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,065
We could post a pic

874
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,400
and see if anyone
recognizes her?

875
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,302
That's a great idea, Wendy,
let's do that.

876
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,971
Here, Elizabeth,
let me take a photo.

877
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,142
Oh, that's seriously bright.

878
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,848
Are you okay?

879
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,149
Yeah.

880
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,684
Yeah, I think so.

881
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,652
Why don't you sit down?

882
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:22,931
You know, uh, maybe
that's enough for now.

883
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,121
Okay, thanks.

884
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,489
Thanks, Wendy.

885
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,335
Skipping stones?

886
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,548
I haven't done that
since I was a kid.

887
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:41,705
Well then, you're
seriously missing out.

888
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,040
Wanna try?

889
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,942
Sure.

890
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,846
Ooh...

891
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:51,281
Only two bounces, huh?

892
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,317
Oh, I'm sorry,

893
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,952
I didn't realize that
this was a competition.

894
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,488
Ah, come on...

895
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,457
Here we go.

896
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:03,727
Three!

897
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,028
Good one.

898
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,765
You okay?

899
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,540
Just frustrated.

900
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,710
Nothing I'm doing is helping me
bring my memory back.

901
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,423
You know, I was doing
some research this morning,

902
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:22,858
and apparently some people
find it helpful

903
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,848
to write down their experiences.

904
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,150
It helps them kind of
jog their memories.

905
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,685
Anyway, I, uh...

906
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,389
I brought you this.

907
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,492
A journal?

908
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,527
Thank you.

909
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,162
You're welcome.

910
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,431
You know, I also just wanted
to check your vitals

911
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,067
A house call
at your actual house,

912
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:44,902
I'm impressed.

913
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:46,870
Just look at me
for a sec?

914
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,705
Okay.

915
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,440
- Does that hurt at all?
- No.

916
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,675
No.

917
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,710
Okay.

918
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,610
Let me see your hand for a sec.

919
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,212
Just give me your wrist.

920
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,684
Heart rate is a little fast,

921
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,753
but that should normalize
by morning.

922
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:04,855
I'm just going to check
your eyes here, okay?

923
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,694
Okay, looks great.

924
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,197
I mean, yeah,
everything looks good.

925
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:21,104
So, you just relax,
enjoy your time,

926
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,417
and I'll check you out again
in the morning, okay?

927
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,174
Thanks, Doc.

928
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:31,815
Don't worry,

929
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,084
we're going to get you home.

930
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,420
In the meantime, we are happy
to have you here, so...

931
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,688
Thank you.

932
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,109
Hi, uh,

933
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,844
sorry I'm late,
I had to change.

934
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,879
- Did I miss breakfast?
- Good morning.

935
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:36,847
No, I left you
a plate right there

936
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,382
on top of the stove.

937
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,527
Don't worry about being late.

938
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,162
I'm definitely not a stickler
about time, right, kids?

939
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,020
Yeah, right, Dad!

940
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,388
No comment.

941
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,533
So, any luck
with your memory

942
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,124
this morning?

943
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,959
Uh, no, not yet.

944
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,527
Apparently,
my brain's late, too.

945
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,508
So, listen, we're going
to head into town.

946
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,364
Emily's gonna go
to the library

947
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,599
to work on her play,

948
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,445
and Alex is going to go hang out
with my parents at the diner.

949
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,335
Do you want to...

950
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,469
catch a ride in with us?

951
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,625
It's probably better than
hanging around here all day.

952
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,373
Um...

953
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,842
Yeah, sure. Why not?

954
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:09,946
Bye, Dad.

955
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:11,359
We'll meet you
at the diner at 5:00.

956
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,816
Okay, sounds good.

957
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,329
You make sure you get Alex
to Nana's, right?

958
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,218
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

959
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,319
Bye.

960
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:17,154
Are you sure you're going
to be okay by yourself?

961
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,789
You're more than welcome
to come down,

962
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,489
hang out at the office
if you want.

963
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,457
Uh, no, thanks,

964
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,070
I think I'm going to head
over to the library

965
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,460
and do some more research,

966
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,728
see what comes to me.

967
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:25,862
Okay.

968
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,165
You know, just
so you know, uh,

969
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,132
Kevin, the sheriff
you met yesterday,

970
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,001
he's doing all that he can
for you as well.

971
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,202
I know.

972
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,003
I just, I could
barely sleep last night,

973
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:33,804
thinking about

974
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,216
how there could be
somebody out there

975
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,207
looking for me
as we speak.

976
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,041
I completely
understand.

977
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,343
Then again, I could
also be a recluse

978
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,845
that lives alone
somewhere.

979
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,180
Oh, I doubt that.

980
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,748
Either way, I just...

981
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,383
I feel like
I need to do something.

982
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,652
Okay, well, good luck,

983
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:49,898
and if you need to pick up
anything afterwards,

984
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,199
you can find them
on these two blocks.

985
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,400
You've got my office
down there

986
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,024
a thrift store,

987
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,425
farmer's market.

988
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:56,526
Great, okay,

989
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,394
well, I'll take it
from here.

990
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,429
Okay, sounds good.

991
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,699
Oh, except, uh...

992
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:03,934
I don't have any money.

993
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,268
I'm sorry.

994
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,937
I swear, I'll pay you back.

995
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,873
You know what,
don't even worry about it.

996
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:10,707
There you go.

997
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,641
Thanks.

998
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:12,576
Hey, you never know,
maybe I'll find out

999
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,178
that I'm an heiress
to a great fortune.

1000
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,125
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say probably not.

1001
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,748
- You never know.
- No, it's true.

1002
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:19,784
You know what,

1003
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,463
I don't care if you even
have a dime to your name,

1004
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,764
I just want to make sure
you get home safe.

1005
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,054
Amen to that.

1006
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,188
Okay, I'll see you later.

1007
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,224
Bye.

1008
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,110
Hey...

1009
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,380
you're the woman who lost
her memory, aren't you?

1010
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:51,548
Yeah.

1011
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,816
Yes...

1012
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,918
Word travels fast around here.

1013
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,220
Oh, I actually
took your photo at Town Hall.

1014
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,321
Oh, right.

1015
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,389
Hi!

1016
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,424
I'm Wendy.

1017
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:01,324
I'm... Elizabeth.

1018
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,459
Hi.

1019
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,729
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1020
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,830
Oh, you're sweet.

1021
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:10,734
I, um, I've been online
for hours,

1022
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,637
but I think I've officially
run out of things to search for.

1023
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,073
Yeah, how can you
search for yourself

1024
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:18,475
when you don't even know
your name

1025
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,143
or where you came from?

1026
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,612
Yeah, exactly.

1027
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,080
I think I just need
a little break.

1028
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,350
What are you working on?

1029
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,452
I'm starting college
in the fall,

1030
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,955
so I have to fill out
all these housing forms online.

1031
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,256
Oh, that's great.

1032
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,424
What school?

1033
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:35,325
Emerson,

1034
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,626
for Communications.

1035
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,398
The campus is literally
in the heart of Boston.

1036
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,770
In Boston...

1037
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:47,805
Everything okay?

1038
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,340
<i>- Hi!
- Yeah.</i>

1039
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:52,643
Yeah.

1040
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,877
Yeah, I, uh...

1041
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,646
I just realized
I have to be somewhere.

1042
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,480
Good luck with school.

1043
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,949
Thanks.

1044
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,060
Hey!

1045
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,662
Uh, any news on Elizabeth?

1046
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,464
Not yet.

1047
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,366
I sent her DNA
to the lab in Concord,

1048
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,512
but that won't be ready
for a week.

1049
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:18,702
Hmm.

1050
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,981
It doesn't make
any sense, does it?

1051
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,916
She's been missing four days,
and no one's looking for her?

1052
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,418
Well, there could be
a bunch of reasons.

1053
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,874
Maybe she lives alone.

1054
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,987
Yeah, no, I was
thinking about that,

1055
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,043
but then, you know,

1056
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,856
what about like, family,
or friends, or co-workers?

1057
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,680
Well, it's anybody's guess
at this point.

1058
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:31,915
Let's just give it
some time.

1059
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,584
Yeah, I guess
that makes sense.

1060
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,820
I'm just, you know,
trying to figure it out.

1061
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:37,855
Yeah.

1062
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:38,889
I noticed.

1063
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:46,997
Hey, Emily.

1064
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,164
How's it going?

1065
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,599
Not that great.

1066
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:50,567
I can't seem to figure out

1067
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,603
how to turn my story
into a play for Fall Fest.

1068
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,538
Oh, well, maybe I can help.

1069
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,606
What's it about?

1070
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,242
Well, it's set in a school,

1071
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:02,912
and the lead is a popular
13-year-old girl named Erin

1072
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,381
who loses a pair
of concert tickets

1073
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,448
for a show that evening.

1074
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,550
In order
to find the tickets,

1075
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:08,952
she has no choice

1076
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,698
but to ask for the help
of several classmates

1077
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,200
who she's never even
talked to before.

1078
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,624
She doesn't end up
finding the tickets,

1079
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,437
but she does end up
with two new best friends.

1080
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,361
I like it.

1081
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,297
So she ends up gaining
more than she loses.

1082
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,564
Huh?

1083
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,666
Well, in other words,

1084
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,701
the concert would have only
lasted her one night,

1085
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,569
but the friendships
could end up

1086
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,538
lasting her a lifetime.

1087
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:29,472
Oh...

1088
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:30,540
Yes.

1089
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,142
That's it.

1090
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,411
So, in order
to set up the story,

1091
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,313
you can have a scene

1092
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:39,149
where you show Erin
and her popular friends

1093
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,984
not speaking so kindly

1094
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,953
about the two students
who end up helping her.

1095
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,100
That way we can quickly explain
where all the characters stand.

1096
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,457
And at the end,

1097
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,291
they could maybe have a scene

1098
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:49,959
where Erin defends
her new friends

1099
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:50,860
from the popular ones.

1100
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,595
I think you might be
a natural at this.

1101
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,663
And who knows,

1102
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,143
you might be a theatre teacher
in your real life.

1103
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,132
Hmm.

1104
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,668
Well, I'm actually headed
to the thrift shop,

1105
00:38:58,704 --> 00:38:59,669
for a new wardrobe,

1106
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,505
so I'm really hoping
I'm a fashion designer.

1107
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,985
Do you wanna come with me
in case I'm wrong?

1108
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:04,808
Sure, that'd be fun.

1109
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,286
Uh-huh, that's... different.

1110
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,988
Emily, you're allowed
to speak your mind.

1111
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,368
I promise, you won't
hurt my feelings.

1112
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,692
I know, but I want you
to buy what you like.

1113
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,805
You're the one
who's gonna be wearing it.

1114
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,829
That's a good point.

1115
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,874
But I still want your opinion.

1116
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,932
What, I don't get
an opinion?

1117
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,333
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

1118
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,369
Hello, Dr. Callan,

1119
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,769
Are you
checking up on us?

1120
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,382
I just finished work
at the clinic early,

1121
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:35,950
was just walking by,
saw you girls in the window,

1122
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,140
and thought,

1123
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,986
you know, since I have such
an amazing sense of style...

1124
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,211
Yeah, right, Dad.

1125
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,112
What?

1126
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,147
Something tells me

1127
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,892
you're stretching the truth
there, Dr. Callan.

1128
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,015
Maybe just a little.

1129
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,217
Well, good,
since you're here,

1130
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,852
we're going
to put you to work,

1131
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,254
maybe you can help us decide
what my new wardrobe should be.

1132
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,124
Great. Okay.

1133
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,359
Oh, look at this,

1134
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:57,894
how about that?

1135
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:58,929
Dad, are you kidding?

1136
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,864
Elizabeth would never wear
something like that.

1137
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,866
Yeah, Emily's right.

1138
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,234
I don't know
what my identity is,

1139
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,835
but it doesn't involve
that suit.

1140
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,303
Right.

1141
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:09,973
Okay, well, how about
the three of us split up,

1142
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,307
and meet back
at the change rooms

1143
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,675
in, like, 10 minutes?

1144
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:13,977
Okay, sounds like a plan.

1145
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:14,811
Sounds good.

1146
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,846
Good.

1147
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,354
Ooh...

1148
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,055
- Mm-mm, no.
- No?

1149
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,360
Yeah?

1150
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,561
Too much?

1151
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,596
Or, actually,
you know,

1152
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,063
maybe it's
a little too much.

1153
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,900
Oh, that's nice,
but it is pretty shiny.

1154
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,034
Yeah, I don't
think so.

1155
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,604
I think this is it.

1156
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,039
I love it.

1157
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:46,009
Wow, it's, uh...

1158
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,144
it-it looks really good.

1159
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:50,880
It's nice.

1160
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,384
Okay.

1161
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,590
What's for dinner?

1162
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,724
Meatloaf from the diner.

1163
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,293
Nana's secret recipe.

1164
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,129
It's not really
a secret, Dad.

1165
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:09,232
Nana tells everyone
that recipe now.

1166
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,468
Right, okay, well,
I guess I stand corrected.

1167
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:14,704
Well, secret or not,
it smells delicious.

1168
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,651
Alex, bud, can you turn
the TV off for me, please?

1169
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,208
Oh, no worries, I got it.

1170
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,309
Okay, thank you.

1171
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,655
Did you guys put
the utensils out?

1172
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,157
<i>- -Athena, it's a superstorm,
you've gotta get us outta here!</i>

1173
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,258
<i>I'm trying, but the crystal
isn't working.</i>

1174
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:24,948
<i>Well, you'd better
figure something out</i>

1175
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,417
<i>'cause we don't have much time!</i>

1176
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,097
<i>Please
just help us once more!</i>

1177
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,125
You okay?

1178
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,230
I...

1179
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:43,600
I think I just had a memory
from my real life,

1180
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,736
but I don't know
how to connect the dots.

1181
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,805
Okay, you're putting
so much pressure on yourself

1182
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,908
without realizing that
you've been through a trauma.

1183
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,243
So, what do I do?

1184
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:54,511
My suggestion is,

1185
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,179
you stop trying so hard
to remember,

1186
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,281
and trust that
it will all come back to you.

1187
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,520
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better, are you?

1188
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,788
You might be a therapist
in your real life,

1189
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,657
but I'm a practicing MD
in this one.

1190
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:12,462
Now, let's just
go sit down

1191
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,364
and enjoy dinner, okay?

1192
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,665
Okay.

1193
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,533
Give me a minute.

1194
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:17,467
Okay.

1195
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:18,902
Thank you.

1196
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:22,939
Hey, guys...

1197
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:23,740
Is everything okay?

1198
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:24,952
Yeah,
everything's fine.

1199
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,309
Everybody
got on here?

1200
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,477
Yeah.

1201
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:40,356
We went
to the thrift store.

1202
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,625
Lucky...

1203
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,129
And what is
the arc again?

1204
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,531
It's basically
the emotional journey

1205
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,632
of your lead character

1206
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,234
over the course
of the play.

1207
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:54,137
So it's when I take a character
from being mean

1208
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,405
to compassionate

1209
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,906
by the end the story?

1210
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,641
Yeah, that's right.
You got it.

1211
00:42:58,677 --> 00:42:59,976
This is so helpful.

1212
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,177
Good, I'm glad.

1213
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:03,980
Hey.

1214
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,259
What are you guys
doing up so early?

1215
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,382
Hey, Dad.

1216
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,085
Elizabeth is helping me
with my play for Fall Fest.

1217
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,399
She didn't wake you,
did she?

1218
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:12,463
- No, no, I was up.
- Okay.

1219
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,360
Has Prince Alex graced us
with his presence yet?

1220
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,428
Not yet,

1221
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,174
but I heard him playing
video games this morning.

1222
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,332
Okay. Alex,
time for breakfast, bud!

1223
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,834
Are you sure you're okay
taking these two?

1224
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,903
Because I can drive them down,
drop them off...

1225
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,404
Oh, no,
it's the least I can do.

1226
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,372
Well, you say that now,

1227
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,074
but wait till you try
to get him to do...

1228
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,241
well, anything.

1229
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,610
We'll be fine.

1230
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:34,944
All right.

1231
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,081
Well, this is my cell phone,

1232
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,048
work number,

1233
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:39,916
and if you need my dad,

1234
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,851
he'll be here
within minutes, okay?

1235
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,120
This is very
professional, Dr. Callan.

1236
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,456
You mean annoyingly organized?

1237
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:47,857
I prefer responsible.

1238
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:48,858
Whatever.

1239
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:49,959
Whatever you!

1240
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,038
You just be good, all right?

1241
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:51,961
Okay.

1242
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:52,862
You know
where to reach me.

1243
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:53,897
Okay.

1244
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,873
Hey, what's up?

1245
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:07,888
Looks like we have
the whole day together.

1246
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:08,745
What do you wanna do?

1247
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:14,617
Okay, well,
you're obviously busy.

1248
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,597
I just came by to see
if you wanted to help me out

1249
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,721
with this secret mission
I'm about to start,

1250
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:20,957
but, um, we could each do
our own thing today

1251
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,992
if you want.

1252
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,699
What kind of secret mission?

1253
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,345
This is
the secret project?

1254
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,347
Yeah, it's a surprise
for your dad.

1255
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:46,182
All she needs
is some oil, some varnish,

1256
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,751
and a few holes patched.

1257
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,953
Sounds like a lot
of work to me.

1258
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:51,954
Well, it won't be easy,

1259
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,089
but if we work together,

1260
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,491
we can get this done in no time.

1261
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:56,767
You know what the best part is?

1262
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:59,429
It's great for fishing.

1263
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,797
Really?

1264
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,198
Mm-hmm.

1265
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,400
Unless you have to get back
to your video game?

1266
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,003
Nah, the game can wait.

1267
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,604
Great, okay.

1268
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,341
Okay, go around that way.

1269
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,113
That sounds terrific.

1270
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:19,026
So, when do you think
we can expect a new outline

1271
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,616
from Angela?

1272
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:21,884
Oh, uh...

1273
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,387
I'd say, probably
within a few weeks?

1274
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,455
Great.

1275
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,690
Because if the film
takes off,

1276
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,826
the demand for the next book
will be extraordinary.

1277
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:30,861
Amazing.

1278
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,061
And not to worry,

1279
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,163
Angela knows
this is a top priority.

1280
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,131
Thank you guys so much
for coming in.

1281
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,132
Appreciate it.

1282
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:37,600
Thank you.

1283
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:40,870
Thanks.
Good to see you.

1284
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:41,971
Love those glasses.

1285
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,172
Okay, man.

1286
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,240
I trust you.

1287
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,007
Always a pleasure,
thank you.

1288
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,309
Bye, thank you.

1289
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,210
See you later.

1290
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,245
Bye.

1291
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,480
Bye.

1292
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,216
Brad, it's been
four days

1293
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,684
without
any communication.

1294
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,819
She has never gone this long
without talking to me.

1295
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,666
Wait, aren't you the one
who said, "Stop worrying, Brad,

1296
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,970
she just needs some time alone"?

1297
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,492
I think we should go
to the police.

1298
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:04,405
Whoa, Cynthia, Cynth,
calm down, she's fine, okay?

1299
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,394
And actually,

1300
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,497
we're getting a lot
more work done without her.

1301
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,065
I'm sorry, but I cannot
keep pretending

1302
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,333
like it's business as usual.

1303
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,200
Okay, I hear you.

1304
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,535
I hear you.

1305
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,581
How about this, how about,

1306
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,505
if we don't hear anything
in the next 48 hours,

1307
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,272
we go the police?

1308
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,907
But until then,
let's just assume

1309
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,943
that she's at
a relaxation spa somewhere,

1310
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:23,746
getting a seaweed wrap
or something.

1311
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,161
So I'm curious,

1312
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:40,062
why did you guys stop
using the canoe?

1313
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,064
I remember
my dad and mom

1314
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,466
used to take it
out on the water

1315
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,501
to watch the sunsets.

1316
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,137
Maybe it just reminds him of her
too much.

1317
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,383
That must have been
a really tough time

1318
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:50,473
for everybody.

1319
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:52,875
Yeah, our Nana and Grandpa
stayed a lot back then,

1320
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:55,878
and I remember we made
lots of cookies.

1321
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:57,814
Well, hopefully this
surprise will do the trick.

1322
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:59,415
Yeah, he's gonna love it!

1323
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,995
Well, we've been
working on it for three days,

1324
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,251
he'd better love it.

1325
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,459
Hey.

1326
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,694
Hey, uh, any new
developments

1327
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,396
on Elizabeth?

1328
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,109
Actually, I was following up
on a missing persons lead

1329
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,299
out of Tallahassee,

1330
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,867
but it turned out to be
someone else.

1331
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,135
Hmm.

1332
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,937
But for now,
you and the kids

1333
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:21,904
like having her
at the house, right?

1334
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,805
Yeah.

1335
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,374
No, she's been great.

1336
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,242
This morning,

1337
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,588
she was helping Emily
with her play,

1338
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:28,444
and Alex, well,

1339
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,912
Alex hasn't put her
in a closet yet,

1340
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:30,880
so that's
a good thing, right?

1341
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,318
Yeah. Yeah, I'd say
that's progress.

1342
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,787
I tell you though, man,
it's crazy

1343
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:38,866
ever since she's been
staying with us,

1344
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,123
it's like we're just...
happier than we've been

1345
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,258
in a long time, you know?

1346
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,460
What's so crazy about that?

1347
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:45,261
That's a good thing.

1348
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:46,729
I know.

1349
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:47,830
That's the problem.

1350
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:48,831
I worry about the kids,

1351
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:52,001
you know, when she eventually
has to leave.

1352
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,769
Jeff, you and I go way back.

1353
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,304
Take my advice.

1354
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,106
Don't worry about it so much.

1355
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,442
Just enjoy the time
you do have with her.

1356
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:01,410
You're right, you're right.

1357
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:03,579
And besides, right,

1358
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:04,925
she's got some friends
and family out there

1359
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,449
that are looking for her
right now,

1360
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:07,416
and that's a good thing, so...

1361
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,417
Yeah.

1362
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:09,418
Thanks, buddy.

1363
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,989
Watch your step.
Don't look...

1364
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,324
This is a little
dramatic, don't you think?

1365
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,592
Are you kidding?

1366
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:19,039
It is not nearly dramatic enough
for what you're about to see.

1367
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,329
Okay, why do get the feeling

1368
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:21,609
I'm about to walk
into the water...

1369
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,132
Okay, no more
talking, Doctor.

1370
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,200
All right.

1371
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,334
Keep your eyes
closed.

1372
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,103
Okay, on the count
of three...

1373
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,204
Don't look.

1374
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,205
One...

1375
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,206
Two...

1376
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,474
Three!

1377
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,109
Surprise!

1378
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:38,916
Wow.

1379
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:42,318
It's pretty cool, right, Dad?

1380
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,656
Oh, no...

1381
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:47,691
you don't like it.

1382
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,227
Oh, I shouldn't have done
any of this...

1383
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,539
- I'm-I'm so sorry...
- No, no, no...

1384
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,530
No, it's...

1385
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,165
it's beautiful.

1386
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,000
It's...

1387
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,069
exactly like when
my grandfather brought it home

1388
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,203
for the first time.

1389
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,406
Well, it turns out

1390
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,641
I probably know
quite a bit about canoes

1391
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:06,842
in my real life.

1392
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:08,177
But honestly,

1393
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:10,313
I could not have done it
without Emily and Alex.

1394
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,817
This brings back
so many memories.

1395
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:15,852
Well...

1396
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:19,355
maybe it's time for you
to make some new ones.

1397
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,691
Why don't you take Alex out
for her first test drive?

1398
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,526
What do you say, bud,
you want to do that?

1399
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,327
- Yeah!
- Okay.

1400
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:26,195
But you gotta go next
with me, okay?

1401
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,831
- Okay.
- All right.

1402
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:31,267
Should I go get
the life jackets?

1403
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,168
Do that.

1404
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:33,803
I'll come with you.

1405
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:36,839
Thank you.

1406
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:44,280
It is beautiful out here,
huh, son?

1407
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,681
Yeah.

1408
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:47,249
Oh, man, I miss
being out here,

1409
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,018
that's for sure.

1410
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,466
They look pretty good
out there, huh?

1411
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,522
Yeah.

1412
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,091
They look happy.

1413
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,093
Yeah.

1414
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,195
See that spot
right over there?

1415
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,796
Uh-huh.

1416
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,376
That's where your Uncle Jordan
and I got stuck

1417
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,632
when we were kids.

1418
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:04,533
What, really?

1419
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:05,946
Yeah.
Got in trouble that day.

1420
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,603
I like it here, Dad.

1421
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:10,172
Yeah, me too, son.

1422
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,079
Whoa, did you see
that fish jumping?

1423
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:18,080
Where?

1424
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,081
Right there.

1425
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,586
Okay.

1426
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,023
Ah, it's beautiful.

1427
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:32,973
Emily, what does this
remind you of?

1428
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:34,463
The picnic at Fisher Cove?

1429
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:35,731
Exactly.
Remember that?

1430
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,067
With the ants all over
our sandwiches?

1431
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:39,246
Oh, my gosh,
we ate cookies for lunch!

1432
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,469
That was the best.

1433
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:41,537
Okay, for the record,

1434
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,472
we don't normally get
to eat cookies for lunch,

1435
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:44,974
but it was
a last resort.

1436
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:46,689
Oh, don't worry,
I believe you, Dr. Callan.

1437
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:48,632
What's that
supposed to mean?

1438
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,614
Well, you just seem like

1439
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:54,283
a predictably
"by-the-books" kinda guy,

1440
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:55,484
that's all.

1441
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,352
Okay, first of all,

1442
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,287
I am not a by-the-books
kind of guy.

1443
00:50:58,322 --> 00:50:59,255
Oh, really?

1444
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,290
What?

1445
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,657
I can be spontaneous.

1446
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:04,493
Yeah, right, Dad.

1447
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:05,294
What? I can!

1448
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:06,595
Okay.

1449
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:07,791
Okay, why don't you prove it?

1450
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,633
Okay, I will.

1451
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,337
What? Now?

1452
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:16,373
Mm-hmm.

1453
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,874
Okay.

1454
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,342
Um...

1455
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,011
All right.

1456
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,479
You ready for this?

1457
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,782
Whoa, Dad...

1458
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:28,495
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Where are you going?

1459
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:29,530
You're just kidding, right?

1460
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:30,486
Dad...

1461
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:31,521
What are you doing?

1462
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:32,988
No way,
he's just kidding.

1463
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,464
Oh, my gosh!

1464
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,398
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1465
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,332
Yes, Dad!

1466
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,402
You see?

1467
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,479
Well...

1468
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,214
this is me.

1469
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,049
Yup.

1470
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,395
Oh, here, let me
give you your jacket.

1471
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:03,219
Oh, no, you, uh,
you keep it.

1472
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,488
I know where to find you.

1473
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,661
Thanks again for today, Jeff.

1474
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:15,564
I honestly
wouldn't change a thing.

1475
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,001
Me neither.

1476
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:22,938
Hey, Dad!

1477
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:25,875
Can I have
a snack before bed?

1478
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,010
Alex, it's past your bed...

1479
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:32,715
Yeah, I'll be right in!

1480
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,916
Okay.

1481
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,051
I should probably go.

1482
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:38,053
Yeah, of course.

1483
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:39,555
Sleep well.

1484
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,190
You too.

1485
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:08,717
Hey.

1486
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:09,753
Hi!

1487
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,893
Elizabeth, can I
talk to you about something?

1488
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:18,894
Yeah.

1489
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:19,762
Sure.

1490
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,397
What's up?

1491
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,934
Here's the thing.

1492
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:26,168
I like you.

1493
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,636
The kids like you,
that's obvious.

1494
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:28,737
But first and foremost,

1495
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,606
I'm your doctor,
you are my patient,

1496
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,107
and as long
as that is the case,

1497
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:35,911
I have a code of ethics
that I live by,

1498
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,491
which includes not getting
romantically involved

1499
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,014
with anyone under my care.

1500
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,950
Right.

1501
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:43,519
Yeah, no, I-I agree.

1502
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,954
100%.

1503
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:47,656
Good. That's great.

1504
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:48,624
- Good. 'Kay?
- Yup.

1505
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,692
Yup.

1506
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,527
I mean, as we both know,

1507
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,597
I could have a boyfriend
or a husband.

1508
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:56,532
Who knows, I may even
have kids of my own.

1509
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,635
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
that-that's true.

1510
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,470
Well, good so it's settled,

1511
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,139
From now on, we'll just
keep everything very...

1512
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:05,341
professional.

1513
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:06,408
Yeah.

1514
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:07,788
I think that's probably
for the best, you know?

1515
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1516
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,480
So, I assume
you're going to go to work?

1517
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:12,548
Yup.

1518
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,449
I'll, uh,
I'll stay here,

1519
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:15,618
and I'll help the kids
with Fall Fest.

1520
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:16,619
Yeah, good, that sounds great.

1521
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:17,686
All is well, so...

1522
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:19,333
Oh, right, 'cause tonight's
the final rehearsal

1523
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:20,467
before the big show tomorrow.

1524
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,390
Is Emily so excited?

1525
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,192
Emily is so excited.

1526
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:30,299
Well, go to work...

1527
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,345
- Yes, I'll just go.
- Yeah.

1528
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,501
I think that makes...

1529
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,836
- It makes...
- It'll help.

1530
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:34,871
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

1531
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,816
So, what do
we do first?

1532
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,852
Well, we're going
to, um,

1533
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,488
re-trace every
single step they made

1534
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,934
since the minute
you came into school today.

1535
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:54,857
Good luck,

1536
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,059
I can barely remember
what I had for lunch.

1537
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:58,661
I'm sorry,

1538
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,396
would my character
even say that?

1539
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:02,531
Sabrina, can you just
please stay in character?

1540
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,066
I hate to say it, but, um...

1541
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,502
I was kind of thinking
the same thing,

1542
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:08,203
Emily.

1543
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:11,875
I didn't do anything.

1544
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,612
So, now what am I
going to do?

1545
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,547
Maybe it's not working.

1546
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,549
I don't know.

1547
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:21,617
You know what,

1548
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,786
why don't we take
a little break.

1549
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,254
Emily and I will work
on the script,

1550
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,600
and we'll get you
a new one tonight, okay?

1551
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:27,923
- Okay.
- Bye.

1552
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:31,026
Hey, don't worry,

1553
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:32,528
you still have time
to fix this.

1554
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:33,563
Not really.

1555
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:35,698
The play is tomorrow.

1556
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:37,599
What am I even doing?

1557
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:38,635
I'm gonna
embarrass myself

1558
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,202
in front of
the entire town.

1559
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,037
No. No, you're not.

1560
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,706
You're gonna be great,
you'll see.

1561
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:48,243
Thanks.

1562
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:49,790
I don't know how would
have done all of this

1563
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,046
without your help.

1564
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:52,748
Aw... that's sweet.

1565
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,283
No, I'm serious.

1566
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,330
It's important to me that
you're gonna be here tomorrow

1567
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:57,219
to help me get through this.

1568
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,254
Okay?

1569
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,822
Of course.

1570
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,457
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1571
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:09,732
So, you say

1572
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:12,768
Ms. Young has done
something like this before?

1573
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,069
Yeah, a...

1574
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:15,105
a few times,

1575
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:16,338
but only to unwind.

1576
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,073
And just for, like,
a weekend or so.

1577
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:19,775
Okay.

1578
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,077
Let's see...

1579
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:24,446
I have Angela Young,

1580
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:27,616
5'7", 126 pounds?

1581
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:30,085
Green eyes,
dark-brown hair,

1582
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:32,654
last seen
leaving in a blue Pontiac,

1583
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,756
October 3rd,

1584
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,157
Tuesday.

1585
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,692
Is there
anything else?

1586
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,538
We mentioned that she's
a very successful author,

1587
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:39,595
right?

1588
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,796
Yes, sir, you did,

1589
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,097
several times, yeah.

1590
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:43,866
Is there anything else
we can do on our end

1591
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,701
to help?

1592
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,770
No, just let us get this
missing person's report

1593
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,004
into the system,

1594
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:49,938
and we'll see what pops up.

1595
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:50,974
Okay?

1596
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,008
And don't worry.

1597
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,375
We're doing everything we can.

1598
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,476
Great.

1599
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:55,477
Thank you.

1600
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:56,812
Yeah, no problem.

1601
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,320
Are you hard at work,

1602
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:06,989
or hardly working
over here?

1603
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,991
Oh, neither.

1604
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,059
I'm just writing in my journal,

1605
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,061
hoping that I'd trigger
a memory or two.

1606
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,963
Sounds like
you deserve a break.

1607
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:18,133
Well, you don't
have to ask me twice.

1608
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:21,503
Mm, something
smells delicious.

1609
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22,304
That's good timing, Hon'.

1610
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,683
I just popped them
out of the oven.

1611
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:26,008
Mm. Oh, my gosh,

1612
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,509
these are heaven.

1613
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,477
Mm-hmm.

1614
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:29,244
The salty caramel...

1615
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,879
Are these, um,
are these pecans?

1616
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,514
Yes.

1617
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,516
They're absolutely, um...

1618
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,322
Elizabeth, what's wrong?

1619
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:42,090
I don't know, um...

1620
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,392
Yeah, my throat
just feels...

1621
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:44,427
Here, have some water.

1622
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:48,730
Call Jeff.

1623
00:57:58,876 --> 00:57:59,842
Elizabeth...

1624
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,176
She's alive!

1625
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:02,845
She's awake.

1626
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,413
What happened?

1627
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,915
Well, you had
an allergic reaction

1628
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:08,851
to the nuts
in my mom's brownies.

1629
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:10,919
Well, Nana
does say

1630
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,454
they're to die for.

1631
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,457
Okay, why don't you
go up to the house

1632
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:16,725
and get ready
for the festival

1633
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,893
with your sister,
okay?

1634
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:19,294
See you later,
Elizabeth.

1635
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,864
Bye.

1636
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,103
You gave us quite
the scare last night.

1637
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,905
How are you feeling?

1638
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,873
I'm okay.

1639
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:33,075
I have a headache,

1640
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,143
and my throat's really itchy.

1641
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,445
Yeah, that's normal.

1642
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,713
It should be gone shortly.

1643
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,551
Thank you
for taking care of me.

1644
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:43,586
Again.

1645
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:45,921
Not a problem.

1646
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,589
Part of the job.

1647
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,392
Is that all it is?

1648
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,830
No.

1649
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,531
It's not.

1650
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:05,440
I'll go make some coffee, okay?

1651
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:06,642
Okay.

1652
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,277
We've got a big day
ahead of us.

1653
00:59:23,494 --> 00:59:24,593
I decided

1654
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,995
I am going to say something
here on stage at the end.

1655
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,997
But do you think
a speech is too much?

1656
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,299
No, not at all.

1657
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:31,800
You're the voice
of the story.

1658
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:33,769
And you're
pretty adorable,

1659
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:35,382
but I don't know,
I might be a little biased.

1660
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,471
Dad!

1661
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:37,439
Get over here, kiddo.

1662
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:38,307
Yeah!

1663
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,709
See, the whole gang
is here, right?

1664
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,344
What are you doing
here so early?

1665
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:43,490
Yeah, I thought
you couldn't come

1666
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:44,514
until after work.

1667
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:45,447
I don't know,

1668
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:46,415
I guess I thought
I'd take the day off work

1669
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,051
and spend it with
my favorite people, right?

1670
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,787
Besides, I've got the office
forwarding my calls,

1671
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:52,999
so technically
I'm still at work.

1672
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,624
Well, I guess we'll take
what we can get.

1673
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:57,726
Listen, I was just about
to go help your mom.

1674
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,962
Are you going to stick
around here for a bit?

1675
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,663
I'm not going anywhere today.

1676
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:02,965
Okay.

1677
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,732
Well, I'll be right back then.

1678
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:04,866
Okay.

1679
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:11,974
What are you guys
smiling about?

1680
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,408
You.

1681
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,243
What?

1682
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,678
A guy's not allowed to smile?

1683
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:18,647
Come on,
we know, Dad.

1684
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:19,982
You know what?

1685
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:21,850
What's going on
with you and Elizabeth.

1686
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:22,985
You like her.

1687
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,252
It's totally obvious,

1688
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:25,648
the way you smile
all the time now.

1689
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:28,724
It's cool, Dad.
We like her, too.

1690
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:31,526
Okay... listen.

1691
01:00:31,562 --> 01:00:33,996
Guys, I-I know that everybody
really likes Elizabeth,

1692
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:36,531
but you've got to remember
that, you know,

1693
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:38,200
she's not from here,

1694
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,001
and her memory's going
to come back,

1695
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,213
and she's going
to have to leave,

1696
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:41,403
okay?

1697
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:42,871
You never know.

1698
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,673
Yeah, you both said
she would be gone by now,

1699
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,907
but here we are,

1700
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,442
almost two weeks later
at Fall Fest,

1701
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:48,877
and she's still here.

1702
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:50,523
Okay, I just want you
to be prepared, though,

1703
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:51,513
just in case...

1704
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:52,414
You worry to much, Dad.

1705
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:55,050
Trust us, everything's
gonna work out.

1706
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,252
All right.

1707
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:58,287
Get in here.

1708
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,990
Yeah.

1709
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:03,759
Hey...

1710
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:04,760
I thought you'd be
up to your eyeballs

1711
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,194
in pumpkins by now.

1712
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,162
They're still carving.

1713
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:09,231
I'm trying to enjoy the quiet
while I can.

1714
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,799
Good for you.

1715
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:11,900
Do you mind if I join you?

1716
01:01:11,935 --> 01:01:13,669
No, of course.

1717
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,141
Look at you,

1718
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,742
you've been
writing up a storm.

1719
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:21,910
Oh, this?
Yeah, I know,

1720
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:23,812
I'm running out
of pages.

1721
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:24,958
I just want to
write everything down

1722
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:25,647
before I forget.

1723
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,382
Maybe we need to add "writer"

1724
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:29,384
to your list
of possible professions.

1725
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,386
Yeah, I guess anything
is possible.

1726
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,901
Ah, it's a pretty special town,
Hopedale, isn't it?

1727
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,091
It is, indeed.

1728
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,393
I couldn't imagine living
anywhere else.

1729
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:40,829
You're not the first person
I've heard say that.

1730
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,831
It's true.

1731
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,566
Look, whatever happens,

1732
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,902
I'm glad you're here,
sweetheart.

1733
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,170
Thank you.

1734
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,471
Sorry to interrupt,

1735
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,239
but have either of you
seen Emily?

1736
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,153
Steve's having some trouble
hanging up the backdrop,

1737
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:54,943
and he needs some direction.

1738
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,479
Oh, well, that's my cue
to go find Emily.

1739
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:58,514
I'll see you later, Jane.

1740
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:59,614
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1741
01:02:15,749 --> 01:02:17,783
Kevin, what's up?

1742
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:20,018
Well, we've got a lead, buddy.

1743
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:22,254
I'm down in the ravine
up the 146,

1744
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:23,967
about a half mile away from
where we found Elizabeth.

1745
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,792
<i>Some kids were hiking</i>

1746
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:27,759
and found an abandoned car

1747
01:02:27,795 --> 01:02:29,394
smashed into a tree.

1748
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,629
We ran the plate,

1749
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,764
<i>and it belongs to the sister
of a Boston woman</i>

1750
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,433
<i>who's on
the Missing Person's list.</i>

1751
01:02:34,468 --> 01:02:36,368
Looks like it's our girl, Jeff.

1752
01:02:36,403 --> 01:02:38,036
Wow, that's...

1753
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:40,806
That's great.

1754
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:41,773
Yeah, I'll follow up
with Boston

1755
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:42,874
and get back to you.

1756
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,276
Of course, yeah.

1757
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:45,577
That-that sounds good.

1758
01:02:45,612 --> 01:02:47,712
Uh... good work, Kevin.

1759
01:02:47,748 --> 01:02:49,214
<i>All right, bye.</i>

1760
01:03:00,594 --> 01:03:03,094
Hello?

1761
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:04,130
Yes?

1762
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,066
They found the car.

1763
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:10,669
Uh-huh.

1764
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,404
Yeah, okay, uh,
thank you.

1765
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:13,638
We're on our way.

1766
01:03:13,674 --> 01:03:14,639
What? Is she okay?

1767
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:15,841
They only
found the car,

1768
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:16,775
but a woman showed up

1769
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:17,987
in the nearby town
of Hopedale, Vermont,

1770
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:19,088
with amnesia
two weeks earlier.

1771
01:03:19,112 --> 01:03:20,412
Grab your stuff.

1772
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:21,413
Vermont?

1773
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:42,100
- Hey, Elizabeth!
- Hey.

1774
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:43,668
You finally came by the store.

1775
01:03:43,704 --> 01:03:45,344
Yeah, I don't know
what took me this long.

1776
01:03:45,372 --> 01:03:46,505
Have you seen Emily?

1777
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,039
I think she's in the back.

1778
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,107
Ah, thank you.

1779
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:06,691
"Time Visitor..."

1780
01:04:09,663 --> 01:04:12,464
"Angela Young grew up
in Cape Cod, Massachusetts..."

1781
01:04:16,904 --> 01:04:21,006
"Angela has always seen Athena
as a reflection of herself."

1782
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,708
That's me.

1783
01:04:23,744 --> 01:04:26,011
This is my book.

1784
01:04:26,046 --> 01:04:27,012
<i>Angela Young!</i>

1785
01:04:27,848 --> 01:04:30,348
<i>Ms. Young, we need you on set.</i>

1786
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:37,622
I'm Angela Young.

1787
01:04:38,692 --> 01:04:40,025
Elizabeth?

1788
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,060
Elizabeth!

1789
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,462
Hi.

1790
01:04:45,432 --> 01:04:46,731
Hi, I, uh,

1791
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:48,567
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1792
01:04:48,602 --> 01:04:50,201
How did you find me?

1793
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:52,170
Well, you...

1794
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:53,872
you said this was
your favorite place.

1795
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:56,575
What are you reading?

1796
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,877
The "Time Visitor" series.

1797
01:04:58,912 --> 01:04:59,912
Have you heard of them?

1798
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:02,013
Yeah...

1799
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:04,449
Yeah, I think so.

1800
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,217
Big movie coming out, right?

1801
01:05:06,253 --> 01:05:08,053
I love these books.

1802
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:09,808
They make me want to become
a better writer.

1803
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:13,391
You are a good writer, Emily.

1804
01:05:13,427 --> 01:05:16,027
And you're about to stage
your very first play,

1805
01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:17,963
so why are you hiding
in a bookstore?

1806
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,864
The whole town's
gonna be there.

1807
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:20,799
What if they hate it?

1808
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,134
No...

1809
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,136
Look, I know
you feel vulnerable,

1810
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,706
but you did the very best
you could,

1811
01:05:27,741 --> 01:05:29,741
and now it's time
to share it with everyone.

1812
01:05:29,776 --> 01:05:31,543
What if I forget all my lines?

1813
01:05:31,578 --> 01:05:32,989
Oh, you're not going
to forget your lines.

1814
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,879
This will be
an amazing experience for you.

1815
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:36,948
Oh, sure, then how about
we trade places?

1816
01:05:36,984 --> 01:05:38,583
Hah! Not a chance.

1817
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:40,885
But I will be right there
with you the whole time.

1818
01:05:42,322 --> 01:05:43,855
Come on, let's go.

1819
01:06:05,646 --> 01:06:07,479
Dad, what do you think?

1820
01:06:07,514 --> 01:06:08,213
Wow, it kind of
looks like me

1821
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:09,347
in the morning,
doesn't it?

1822
01:06:10,651 --> 01:06:12,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

1823
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:13,351
Um, I was
looking for you.

1824
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:14,452
Is everything okay?

1825
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:15,854
Yup, yup, crisis averted.

1826
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,856
Emily's back on stage now.

1827
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:18,757
Elizabeth,

1828
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,136
look at my pumpkin.
What do you think?

1829
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,760
I love it!
It's great.

1830
01:06:21,795 --> 01:06:22,827
Good work.

1831
01:06:22,863 --> 01:06:23,863
Hey, bud,
listen, uh,

1832
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,608
I just need to talk
to Elizabeth for a minute.

1833
01:06:25,632 --> 01:06:26,643
Would you mind just
giving us a moment?

1834
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,566
Good luck.

1835
01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:31,970
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you...

1836
01:06:32,005 --> 01:06:33,138
Wait, hold on,

1837
01:06:33,173 --> 01:06:34,806
me first.

1838
01:06:37,144 --> 01:06:38,621
You know, I've been hearing
about Fall Fest

1839
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:39,645
ever since I got here,

1840
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,781
and so far, it's living up
to my expectations.

1841
01:06:42,816 --> 01:06:44,215
Good.
That's great, um...

1842
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,251
Wait, Jeff.

1843
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:49,187
You've been my doctor
for the past two weeks,

1844
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:50,967
and I have done everything
you asked me to do,

1845
01:06:50,991 --> 01:06:51,956
haven't I?

1846
01:06:51,992 --> 01:06:53,324
You have.

1847
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,993
Okay, well...

1848
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:57,896
it's my turn now.

1849
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:01,366
I have something very important
to tell you, too,

1850
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:04,402
but I want us to wait.

1851
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:05,882
Let's just have a few hours
to ourselves

1852
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:08,239
before we say
what we need to say.

1853
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:09,507
Deal?

1854
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:12,844
Deal.

1855
01:07:12,879 --> 01:07:13,978
Okay.

1856
01:07:14,014 --> 01:07:15,380
Okay, let's go...

1857
01:07:15,415 --> 01:07:16,514
let's go
have some fun.

1858
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,349
Okay.

1859
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,053
Three, two, one...

1860
01:07:22,089 --> 01:07:23,655
Oh, you ready?

1861
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:37,736
No, you have to
get in there...

1862
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:39,003

1880
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,834
No matter what happens,

1881
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,435
this is how I want
to remember

1882
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:46,671
my time here in Hopedale.

1883
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,741
This is how I want
to remember you.

1884
01:08:49,776 --> 01:08:52,644
I feel the same.

1885
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:55,313
Have a seat.

1886
01:09:02,155 --> 01:09:04,022
You know, having you here
the past couple weeks

1887
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:07,358
has been wonderful
for the kids, but...

1888
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:09,494
it's also pulled me
out of a shell

1889
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:12,797
that I'd built
around myself.

1890
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,768
I'll always be thankful
that you came here.

1891
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:23,474
Oh, look up,

1892
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,343
you're gonna miss
the surprise.

1893
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:36,354
Wow.

1894
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,288
This is just...

1895
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:38,957
This is amazing.

1896
01:09:38,992 --> 01:09:41,192
It is.

1897
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,333
I have to tell you something.

1898
01:09:48,368 --> 01:09:49,400
Wait, hold that thought.

1899
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:50,501
It's time
for Emily's play.

1900
01:09:50,537 --> 01:09:52,537
- Oh!
- We have to go.

1901
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:17,195
If they were
my real friends,

1902
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,162
they wouldn't
have ditched me,

1903
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:19,163
I'm glad I met you.

1904
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,267
Sorry we didn't end up
finding those tickets.

1905
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:24,769
I think I found something
much more important.

1906
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,853
In the end,

1907
01:10:41,888 --> 01:10:44,455
Erin's dilemma would allow her
to meet two people

1908
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:46,824
that she would end up knowing
for the rest of her life.

1909
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,494
She would also learn
one of life's greatest lessons.

1910
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:51,296
Never judge a book by its cover.

1911
01:10:54,534 --> 01:10:56,734
Thank you all
for coming to my first play.

1912
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,636
Hopefully, it won't be
my last play.

1913
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:03,808
But I also want to thank
Elizabeth for all her help.

1914
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,510
I could not have
done this without her.

1915
01:11:05,545 --> 01:11:06,656
Elizabeth, can you
please come up here

1916
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,413
and say a few words?

1917
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:11,516
I don't think
you have a choice.

1918
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,055
Here you go.

1919
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:19,657
Hello, everyone.

1920
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:20,725
Um...

1921
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,028
I'm not much
of a public speaker,

1922
01:11:24,064 --> 01:11:28,433
but, uh...
I'd like to thank all of you

1923
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:30,168
for the incredible support
you've shown me

1924
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,669
since I arrived.

1925
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:34,605
And I'd especially
like to thank Emily,

1926
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:36,507
and her amazing family...

1927
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:41,346
for opening your home
and your hearts to me.

1928
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,581
I'll never forget you.

1929
01:11:46,653 --> 01:11:49,854
But I have something
important to tell you,

1930
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,923
something I just learned
about myself.

1931
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:58,629
Earlier today, my memory
finally returned,

1932
01:11:58,665 --> 01:12:00,732
and it turns out
that my real name is...

1933
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,767
Angela!

1934
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:05,103
Angela, it's me!

1935
01:12:13,113 --> 01:12:15,913
Oh, we missed you,
sweetie!

1936
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:17,415
Angela?

1937
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,549
Are you ready
to come home?

1938
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:19,417
Yes, of course.

1939
01:12:19,452 --> 01:12:20,585
Hi!

1940
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:30,061
Uh, hi, everyone.

1941
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,397
Sorry for interrupting
the festivities,

1942
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,298
but my name is Brad Thompson,

1943
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:36,234
and this is actually
my girlfriend,

1944
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,335
Angela Young,

1945
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,170
and she's been missing
for two weeks,

1946
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:40,538
but we finally
found her.

1947
01:12:45,879 --> 01:12:47,211
I'll talk to you later.

1948
01:12:53,186 --> 01:12:55,286
Hey.

1949
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:56,654
Hey.

1950
01:12:58,358 --> 01:13:00,024
How long did you know?

1951
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,260
Just before I met you
at the festival.

1952
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,295
I'm sorry.

1953
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:05,496
It's okay.

1954
01:13:05,532 --> 01:13:07,298
I've known since
Sheriff Gaines told me

1955
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:09,634
that they found your car
earlier this afternoon.

1956
01:13:11,571 --> 01:13:12,571
I guess we both knew

1957
01:13:12,605 --> 01:13:14,283
that it was going to happen
eventually, right?

1958
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,940
Yeah.

1959
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:18,509
Jeff, I never meant...

1960
01:13:18,545 --> 01:13:19,545
Don't.

1961
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,346
Me neither.

1962
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:28,130
Make sure you say
goodbye to the kids

1963
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,520
before you leave, yeah?

1964
01:13:29,556 --> 01:13:31,389
Yeah. I will.

1965
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:33,524
Maybe name
a couple characters after us.

1966
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:50,041
Are you
really leaving?

1967
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:53,411
Yes, Alex.

1968
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:55,947
It's time for me
to go home.

1969
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,525
I always wanted
a signed copy.

1970
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,694
You bet.

1971
01:14:23,743 --> 01:14:26,844
You take care of
your dad for me, okay?

1972
01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:34,318
So good to meet you.

1973
01:14:36,923 --> 01:14:38,556
Thank you for everything.

1974
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:40,424
You be good.

1975
01:14:43,329 --> 01:14:44,228
You ready?

1976
01:14:44,264 --> 01:14:45,296
Yeah.

1977
01:14:45,331 --> 01:14:46,364
All right.

1978
01:15:03,149 --> 01:15:05,149
This is great.
We got you.

1979
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:08,819
We are getting so many
interview requests.

1980
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:09,754
Are you getting this
Cynthia?

1981
01:15:09,789 --> 01:15:11,822
Yeah, my phone is
seriously blowing up.

1982
01:15:11,858 --> 01:15:12,790
Oh, hang on a sec.

1983
01:15:12,825 --> 01:15:13,791
Yeah, go for Brad.

1984
01:15:13,826 --> 01:15:15,893
Uh-huh, yeah,
no, she's back.

1985
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:16,761
Uh-huh.

1986
01:15:16,796 --> 01:15:18,596
Tomorrow, yeah,
I think we can do that.

1987
01:15:18,631 --> 01:15:19,631
Let me just, uh...

1988
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,065
I'm gonna transfer you
to Cynthia,

1989
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,400
'cause I'm getting
another call.

1990
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,401
Can you take this?

1991
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,402
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1992
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:26,304
Hey, it's Cynthia.

1993
01:15:26,339 --> 01:15:27,805
Gail, how are you?

1994
01:16:00,073 --> 01:16:01,305
Hey!

1995
01:16:01,341 --> 01:16:04,308
So, you go live
in five minutes.

1996
01:16:04,344 --> 01:16:06,611
Terrific.

1997
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,023
Why do I even have to do
this interview?

1998
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:09,714
They don't care
about my work.

1999
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:10,993
All they want to talk about
is Vermont.

2000
01:16:11,017 --> 01:16:12,516
Exactly.

2001
01:16:12,552 --> 01:16:14,785
"Best-selling author
loses memory after accident"?

2002
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,454
It's a great story!

2003
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,167
Yeah, but I don't want
to exploit what happened to me

2004
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:19,457
just to sell more books.

2005
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,891
Angela, you're a storyteller.

2006
01:16:20,927 --> 01:16:22,960
You can't leave out
the best part of the story.

2007
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:26,130
Look, just a couple
more interviews, okay?

2008
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:27,999
You promise?

2009
01:16:28,034 --> 01:16:29,433
I promise.

2010
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:34,338
Hey...

2011
01:16:34,374 --> 01:16:35,640
I really missed you.

2012
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,341
You did?

2013
01:16:37,377 --> 01:16:38,442
Of course.

2014
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:42,346
Let's do this.

2015
01:16:49,489 --> 01:16:50,933
Now, Angela,
we've talked about the books

2016
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:52,023
and the movie,

2017
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:55,693
but we haven't heard about
what happened in Vermont.

2018
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:57,795
Well, I'm still trying
to figure that out myself.

2019
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,264
I mean, you lost your memory.

2020
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,866
What was it like?

2021
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:05,403
After the accident,
and the amnesia that followed,

2022
01:17:05,438 --> 01:17:08,706
I was consumed only with
figuring out who I was,

2023
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:11,375
and how to get home.

2024
01:17:11,411 --> 01:17:13,778
But with the help
of some very special people

2025
01:17:13,813 --> 01:17:15,246
in Hopedale,

2026
01:17:15,281 --> 01:17:17,615
I soon learned to make
the most of the experience

2027
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:18,683
while it lasted.

2028
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,618
What an extraordinary
story.

2029
01:17:20,653 --> 01:17:21,385
Any message

2030
01:17:21,421 --> 01:17:23,921
for the people
who helped you?

2031
01:17:23,956 --> 01:17:26,257
I, uh...

2032
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:30,428
Well, I, um...

2033
01:17:30,463 --> 01:17:32,663
<i>I just hope they realize</i>

2034
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:35,232
<i>what an impact they've had
on my life.</i>

2035
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:39,470
<i>That's it.</i>

2036
01:17:46,646 --> 01:17:48,779
Ange, you were amazing!

2037
01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:49,613
Can you believe that

2038
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:50,759
they already want you
back on the show

2039
01:17:50,783 --> 01:17:51,816
in a month?

2040
01:17:51,851 --> 01:17:53,095
Oh, be sure to mention
your Twitter handle next time,

2041
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:54,452
so we can promote
the new book.

2042
01:17:54,487 --> 01:17:55,764
We really want those
Amazon sales to spike...

2043
01:17:55,788 --> 01:17:57,132
I'm not doing
the show tomorrow, Brad.

2044
01:17:57,156 --> 01:17:58,289
What?

2045
01:17:58,324 --> 01:18:00,024
Oh, uh, no problem.

2046
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:01,025
No problem,

2047
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,538
we can save it all
for<i> The Today Show.</i>

2048
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:04,128
No, I'm not doing
any more interviews.

2049
01:18:04,163 --> 01:18:06,197
I can't do this anymore.

2050
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:07,398
Got it. You need a break.

2051
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,944
We can finally... we can take
that trip to the Berkshires.

2052
01:18:08,968 --> 01:18:10,279
You can write
from the road, I can...

2053
01:18:10,303 --> 01:18:12,803
No, I can't do this...

2054
01:18:12,839 --> 01:18:14,205
anymore.

2055
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,241
Oh.

2056
01:18:18,978 --> 01:18:20,945
I see.

2057
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:24,615
Brad, you are so good
at managing my career.

2058
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:27,251
We have the perfect...

2059
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,719
business relationship.

2060
01:18:28,755 --> 01:18:31,155
But let's be honest,

2061
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:32,890
you care more
about selling books

2062
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,358
than being my boyfriend.

2063
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,161
Look, Ange,
I'll be the first to admit

2064
01:18:37,196 --> 01:18:40,464
our relationship,
it could use some work, but...

2065
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,133
overall, we make
a pretty good team,

2066
01:18:42,168 --> 01:18:44,635
don't we?

2067
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:46,537
Something happened in Vermont.

2068
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:51,776
I finally figured out
who I was,

2069
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:54,578
and who I truly
want to be with,

2070
01:18:54,614 --> 01:18:56,847
and as much as I try to go back
to the way things were,

2071
01:18:56,883 --> 01:18:58,616
I just, I just can't.

2072
01:19:00,553 --> 01:19:02,787
I'm sorry.

2073
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:04,255
It's okay,

2074
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,991
I knew something had changed

2075
01:19:07,026 --> 01:19:08,826
the day we picked you up
in Hopedale.

2076
01:19:08,861 --> 01:19:10,828
I... I could see it
in your eyes.

2077
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:17,101
I want you to be happy, Ange.

2078
01:19:17,136 --> 01:19:18,169
You deserve it.

2079
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,941
You took me places I never
even dreamt for myself.

2080
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:29,814
I'll always remember
what you did for me.

2081
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,725
Hey, promise me
one thing.

2082
01:19:41,761 --> 01:19:43,427
Don't stop writing.

2083
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:56,140
Oh, Cynthia!

2084
01:19:56,175 --> 01:19:57,074
I don't have time to explain,

2085
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:58,220
but I need to borrow
your car.

2086
01:19:58,244 --> 01:19:59,143
What? Again?

2087
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:00,377
Come on, it's brand-new,

2088
01:20:00,413 --> 01:20:01,245
and we have clearly established

2089
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,713
that you're not
a very good driver.

2090
01:20:02,748 --> 01:20:04,068
I promise,
I will never ask again.

2091
01:20:05,184 --> 01:20:06,917
Okay, don't hold me to that.

2092
01:20:06,953 --> 01:20:08,586
You're going back to Vermont,
aren't you?

2093
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:10,054
Yeah, how'd you know?

2094
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:12,424
- Is it that obvious?
- Mm-hmm.

2095
01:20:15,094 --> 01:20:16,494
Thank you.
I love you, sis.

2096
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:18,095
I love you, too.

2097
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:19,130
Oh, hang on!

2098
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,833
Give me your arm.

2099
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:23,869
Oh...

2100
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,339
"Angela".

2101
01:20:29,642 --> 01:20:31,876
You know, just in case.

2102
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,043
Thank you.

2103
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,045
- Bye.
- Bye.

2104
01:20:46,392 --> 01:20:48,592
Okay, toss it back.

2105
01:20:50,997 --> 01:20:52,463
Angela!

2106
01:20:52,498 --> 01:20:54,298
Hi!

2107
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:55,866
- Angela!
- Hi!

2108
01:20:58,004 --> 01:20:59,570
We thought we'd never
see you again.

2109
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,739
I know, I'm sorry I left
in such a rush.

2110
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,307
So dramatic, right?

2111
01:21:03,342 --> 01:21:04,419
Like something
out of your books.

2112
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,110
Ah, speaking of...

2113
01:21:06,145 --> 01:21:09,613
I started working
on a new series.

2114
01:21:12,018 --> 01:21:13,551
The Discovery."

2115
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,788
"Dedicated to
Emily, Alex, and Jeff,

2116
01:21:17,823 --> 01:21:19,657
who helped me find my way."

2117
01:21:19,692 --> 01:21:20,591
That's us!

2118
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:21,759
Yup.

2119
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:22,660
It's only the first
few chapters,

2120
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:24,273
but I would love for you
to give it a read,

2121
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:25,729
get your thoughts.

2122
01:21:25,765 --> 01:21:26,697
You know,
writer to writer.

2123
01:21:26,732 --> 01:21:30,467
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna read it right now.

2124
01:21:32,772 --> 01:21:34,672
Hey, kids!

2125
01:21:34,707 --> 01:21:36,674
Want ice cream?

2126
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:37,908
Thanks!

2127
01:21:40,212 --> 01:21:42,580
Hi.

2128
01:21:42,615 --> 01:21:44,348
Hi.

2129
01:21:44,383 --> 01:21:46,350
What are you doing here?

2130
01:21:46,385 --> 01:21:48,152
What are you doing here?

2131
01:21:48,187 --> 01:21:50,020
I thought
you got out of work at 6:00.

2132
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:52,756
I decided to loosen
my schedule when you left,

2133
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:53,991
you know, to spend more time

2134
01:21:54,026 --> 01:21:55,459
doing the things
that make me happy.

2135
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,729
Yeah, me too.

2136
01:22:01,968 --> 01:22:03,934
I saw your interview on TV.

2137
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,303
You did?

2138
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:07,371
I was awful, wasn't I?

2139
01:22:07,406 --> 01:22:10,174
No, it was good.

2140
01:22:13,913 --> 01:22:15,646
Did we really have an impact
on you?

2141
01:22:16,649 --> 01:22:18,549
Yeah.

2142
01:22:18,584 --> 01:22:20,317
Yeah, you did.

2143
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,187
Look, Jeff...

2144
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:28,225
I didn't know who I was

2145
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,060
or where I belonged

2146
01:22:30,096 --> 01:22:33,330
when I first got here...

2147
01:22:35,501 --> 01:22:37,201
But I do now.

2148
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:40,204
What about your real life?

2149
01:22:43,943 --> 01:22:45,943
This is my real life.

2150
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:01,091
Hey.

2151
01:23:02,928 --> 01:23:04,328
Go sit down...
