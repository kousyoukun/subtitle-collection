3
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,115
- Shh!

4
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,235
- You're up early.

5
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,108
What's all this?

6
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,546
- For the
shower. It's today.

7
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,809
- Isn't
that a little strange?

8
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,681
- What?

9
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:42,640
- Throwing your own baby shower.

10
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,209
- It's just because I
need it to be perfect.

11
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:50,648
It's- it's barely anything,
just people from work,

12
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,650
and Caroline's helping.

13
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:53,738
- Mm-hmm.

14
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,524
- What?
- Nothing.

15
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,092
- Stop making that head.

16
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,748
- You mean that face?

17
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,750
What face should
I make? This face?

18
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:07,622
This face?
- I hate you.

19
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,101
- This face.

20
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:11,234
- Stop making fun of me!

21
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,409
You're frightening me!

22
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,803
- Come here, you.

23
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:15,978
- Are you crazy? Stop!

24
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,458
Careful. I'm gonna break this.

25
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,026
- You're crazy.

26
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,464
Now I can't move.

27
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,336
I can't move.

28
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,037
Much easier.

29
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,735
No, no, no, no.

30
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:34,997
No.

31
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,609
I can't, I can't move.

32
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:42,004
I'm like a turtle
on its, on its back.

33
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,005
- You're like a turtle?

34
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,485
- I'm like a turtle-

35
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,704
- A turtle?
- on its back.

36
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,707
- Hi, turtle.

37
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,421
- Oh my god! Would you come
down from there, please?

38
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:08,552
- I'm fine.

39
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,684
- Come on. I'll help you down.

40
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,902
Yeah, it,

41
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,122
it's done.
- Oh, there it is.

42
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,255
- It's done.
- Thank you.

43
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,519
Okay, what do you think?

44
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,086
- Nice.

45
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,787
Now it's perfect.

46
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,576
- Jo!

47
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,361
This place is amazing!

48
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,580
And it was such a quick
drive from the city.

49
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:37,973
I can't believe it.

50
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,540
Whoa! Oh my god.

51
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,238
Okay.

52
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,588
- Hi! Hello!

53
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,111
Wow!

54
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,070
Jo.

55
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,245
How have you been?

56
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,077
- There we go.

57
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,948
Anybody else want
some sparkling cider?

58
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,036
- Sure, whatever.

59
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,603
- Sure.

60
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:04,042
- To Jo. Can you
please stand up for us?

61
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,217
Yes.
- Come on.

62
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,219
- Yes, yes.

63
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:10,092
To the best boss lady ever.

64
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,790
You are an entrepreneur,

65
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,705
a leader.

66
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,446
You tripled our readership
this year. It's true.

67
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,363
You launched the online
shop, you moved upstate,

68
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:23,235
you did this insane
renovation, by the way,

69
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,803
all the while answering
every single one

70
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,675
of our readers'
comments personally.

71
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,417
And oh, by the way, you
know, making a human.

72
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,421
We would all hate you if we
did not absolutely love you.

73
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,596
- Ugh!

74
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,075
- I feel just so grateful

75
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,555
to be part of the "Love,
Josephine" family.

76
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,122
- Aw!

77
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,342
- Cheers!

78
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,648
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Oh no!

79
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,215
- I know, I know, I said, I
told myself I was not gonna cry,

80
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,738
but I'm really gonna miss you.

81
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,088
- Oh, thanks, but I'm
not going anywhere.

82
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,830
Nothing's going to be any
different. It's just a baby.

83
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,529
How big are they even, you know?

84
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,227
It's like a little, a little,

85
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,055
a little donut,
a little brioche.

86
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,623
- Cheers.

87
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:03,624
- Cheers, Jo.

88
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,629
Bye!

89
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,554
- What do you think?

90
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,904
- I think it's a
little small for me.

91
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,296
- But it's your color, no?

92
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,473
- It is my color, but,

93
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,694
this is better, no?

94
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,135
- Oh!

95
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:08,488
Oh, Spencer, look at this
sweater. It's perfect.

96
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,144
- When's the big day?

97
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,234
- What?

98
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:17,235
- The baby.

99
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,109
- Oh, uh, any day now.

100
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,632
- Aw!

101
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:23,807
Are you scared?

102
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:25,896
- Should I be?

103
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,336
Can I, can I see your baby?

104
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,470
- No.

105
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,167
You never wake a sleeping baby.

106
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,093
- And she stops my hand.

107
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,573
She stops my hand like I'm,

108
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,184
like I'm radioactive
or something.

109
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,927
- Ah.
- Just a sip.

110
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,061
Ah, I wonder that could be.

111
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,889
- Ah, shh. She's just lonely.

112
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:02,846
- Ah, no!

113
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:05,632
- Ah.

114
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,944
- Mom, hi.

115
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,380
- Hi, honey. I
don't want to intrude.

116
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,947
I was just driving by.

117
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,514
- No, no,
it's fine. Come on in.

118
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:19,646
- Oh, no,
no, no, I couldn't.

119
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,821
- Okay.
- Hi.

120
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:21,996
Hi, Jo.

121
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,214
- Hi!

122
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,607
- I made these for you.

123
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,044
For the cravings.
- Ah.

124
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,045
- Try one.

125
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,310
- What's in it?

126
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,356
- Secret recipe.

127
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,488
Magic bars.

128
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,099
Okay, fine.

129
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,492
Peanut butter, coconut,
butterscotch, chocolate,

130
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,931
crushed maraschino
cherries, and bacon bits.

131
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,194
Who knows? Maybe
they'll induce labor.

132
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,326
- Thank you.

133
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,633
- All right. Well, I'm off.

134
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,550
You two enjoy your
last precious moments.

135
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:58,249
- Sit down, Doris. Just join us.

136
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:02,036
- Oh, Jo, I've told
you a million times,

137
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,298
call me Mom.

138
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:08,695
Speaking of which,
I was thinking,

139
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:12,089
Grandma doesn't
feel right to me.

140
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,743
Maybe

141
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,572
Gaddy

142
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,530
or Giddy,

143
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:22,622
Momo or Mimi or Moomoo or
Googoo or Gigi or Geegaw.

144
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,630
- "Can't wait..."

145
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:55,350
Oh, settle down in there.
Mommy's trying to concentrate.

146
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,577
- God. Are you okay?

147
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,839
- Yeah.

148
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:50,797
I'm fine.

149
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:52,799
Just...

150
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,845
Oh.

151
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,673
- Ah, Jesus
- Something's weird.

152
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,153
- Do you think, uh...

153
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,634
- Ah, yeah, I
think it's happening.

154
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:07,814
- Okay.

155
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,381
- No, please!

156
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,209
- Okay, honey.

157
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,082
- Get the
fuck away from me!

158
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,306
- Five.

159
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,354
Two.

160
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,008
One.

161
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,676
- Everything
okay in here?

162
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,939
- Yes.

163
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:14,114
- Yeah, of course.

164
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,637
- Have you pooped yet?

165
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,466
- No.

166
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,772
- You can't
leave until you poop.

167
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,356
- Thank you.
- Ah, you too.

168
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,445
- Thank you so
much for everything.

169
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:25,663
Oh, you too.

170
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:26,838
- Thank you so much.

171
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,840
- Oh, can we get a photo?

172
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,059
- Yeah, yeah. Photo, photo.

173
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,714
- Will you get one of us?

174
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,499
- This will
be her first photo.

175
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,071
Thank you. Thank you so much.

176
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,333
Thank you, thank you.

177
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,205
Okay, bye.
- Goodbye.

178
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,388
- Wait!

179
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,520
You forgot the placenta!

180
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,480
Better than forgetting
the baby, right?

181
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,177
I thought you wanted to eat it.

182
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,658
- The baby?

183
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,268
- The placenta.

184
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,270
It's all nutrients.

185
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,057
Thank you.

186
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,145
- Good luck.

187
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,242
- Ah.

188
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,331
- Okay,
I think she's in.

189
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,551
You ready?
- Yeah.

190
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,599
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,863
It's just, I wish
my mom were here.

192
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,221
- Okay.

193
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:00,410
- You can go faster
than two kilometers per hour.

194
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,457
- Well, I have precious cargo.

195
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,285
- I hope fatherhood is
not going to turn you

196
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,156
into a nervous old lady.

197
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,550
- Now, why would
you say that, deary?

198
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,508
I'm your Giddy, your Gaddy,

199
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:14,903
your Googoo, your Gaga, your-

200
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,035
- Look at the road.

201
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,427
Where are we?

202
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,950
- Home.

203
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,413
- Shh.

204
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:31,588
Shh.

205
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,343
Shh.

206
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:50,172
Shh.

207
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,088
Shh.

208
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,441
Shh.

209
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,973
- Well,
this says they like

210
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,324
to suck, swaddle, and swing.

211
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,587
- I don't need
some book, Spencer.

212
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:18,548
- Well, it says, "Over one
million copies sold, so."

213
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,855
- It's a cliche advice.

214
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,726
I can do this.

215
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,164
I can do this perfectly.

216
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:27,949
Shh.

217
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:49,971
Look.

218
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,193
See?

219
00:19:58,893 --> 00:19:59,720
Well.

220
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,169
Fuck!

221
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:15,736
Who is ringing the doorbell

222
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,259
in the middle of
the fucking night?

223
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,005
- We're here for the gutters.

224
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,965
- Yes, Yes. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

225
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,750
Sorry, sorry, I'm here.

226
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,708
Um, I'm Caroline.
I'm the assistant.

227
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:34,058
We'll set you up
right over there.

228
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,625
Right over there.

229
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:38,149
- Hi.

230
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,934
- Just the guys here
to work on the house.

231
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,153
We'll be outside. We
won't disturb you at all.

232
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,720
And hey, I think our followers

233
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:46,157
are still waiting on a baby pic.

234
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,158
- Yeah.

235
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:49,944
- It's been been a month.

236
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,123
- Oh, uh, I'll get to it.

237
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,820
- I could help you

238
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,213
if it's easier.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

239
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,867
- And I also had some-

240
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,104
- Uh, Jo.

241
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,456
Jo, I think she's hungry again.

242
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:29,810
Shit.

243
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,247
Okay.

244
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,510
Okay.

245
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:35,468
Shh.

246
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,210
Okay.

247
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,387
Yeah.

248
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:44,781
Good girl.

249
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:45,782
Okay.

250
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,742
Here we go.

251
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,960
Here we go.

252
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,484
Okay.

253
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:55,009
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

254
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:56,184
Here we are.

255
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:58,578
Hey.

256
00:21:58,752 --> 00:21:59,535
- Look.

257
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,932
Look how perfect she is.

258
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,194
- Yeah.

259
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,848
Well,

260
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,415
you made her.

261
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:10,720
- We made her.

262
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,425
- Okay.

263
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:42,578
- Ah! Spencer!

264
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:43,840
- What's going on, jo?
- Ruby!

265
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,015
- What's going on?

266
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:50,194
- Of course, I
completely forgot.

267
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,632
I put Ruby up in her
crib hours before.

268
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,939
I mean, the look
on Jo's face was...

269
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:01,554
- I knew all along. You
were more scared than I was.

270
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:02,946
He's nervous about everything.

271
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,905
- I am not.

272
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,256
- First-time parents. The
fears are very, very normal.

273
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,390
Oh, one more question,
though, if I may ask.

274
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,043
The bone was who's?

275
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,481
- Spencer's a butcher.
An artisanal butcher.

276
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,221
- I'm not an artisanal...

277
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,832
I'm a butcher.

278
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:22,052
You know, free range, He
mainly killed no waste.

279
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:25,229
- Anyway, the point is that
we, we were very tired-

280
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,580
- So we thought that maybe
this was the time to, you know,

281
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:31,061
come in and just check in
and just get a little help.

282
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,021
- No, we don't, we don't
really need help, but just to-

283
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,414
- Just to
check in, you know.

284
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:36,763
- Just to check in.

285
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,765
- She cries a lot.

286
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:42,290
- Well, the good news
is she looks fantastic.

287
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,379
Nothing to worry
about whatsoever.

288
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,163
Babies cry.

289
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,165
It's tough, but,

290
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,124
you know,

291
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,908
wait till she's 18.

292
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,955
That's really hell.

293
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,174
Ah.

294
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:59,655
Look at you!

295
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,005
Oh, aren't you the
sweetest little thing?

296
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,792
She's adorable.

297
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,753
- I think she looks a
little thin. Is she too thin?

298
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,190
- The doctor said
she's perfectly normal.

299
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,888
- Maybe she's hungry.

300
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:22,461
Oh!

301
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:26,639
She's got quite a strong suck.

302
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:27,640
- Shh.

303
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,599
- You know, people always
say that new babies are cute.

304
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,558
I think they all look like ET.

305
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,255
I mean, some people
thought ET was cute,

306
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,518
but I just thought
he was a creepy alien

307
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:37,824
that should stay
on his own planet

308
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,869
and leave the rest of us alone.

309
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:46,615
Anyway, if it's any consolation,
I understand how you feel.

310
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,749
Spencer was a crier.

311
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:50,924
- Oh, he was?

312
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,839
- Oh yeah.

313
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,275
- Mom, don't talk
her ear off. She's tired.

314
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,319
- I'm fine.
- Thank you, dear.

315
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,278
I'm parched.

316
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,802
- We're just hearing about
how Ruby takes after you.

317
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,325
- Mom, what have
you been telling her about?

318
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,632
- Nothing. You
were a crier, you were.

319
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,199
- I was an infant.
- So?

320
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,767
Take some responsibility
for your own behavior.

321
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,464
- Mom, you
take some responsibility

322
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,466
for your behavior.
- I did take responsibility

323
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,598
for my behavior.
- So why do you blame-

324
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:13,860
- Why are you arguing?

325
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,514
I told you, this
is .

326
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:16,558
- I'll go upstairs.

327
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,170
- Uh, will you be okay?

328
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,868
- Will you?

329
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:29,223
Well.

330
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,333
Shh.

331
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,259
Shh.

332
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,047
Shh.

333
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:12,962
Shh.

334
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,054
It's okay, Ruby.

335
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:23,756
It's okay.

336
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:29,631
Shh.

337
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,231
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:05,232
Ruby!

339
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,019
Ruby?

340
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,414
Baby. You're okay?

341
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:58,851
- Are you okay?

342
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,113
- Oh, yeah, she's fine.

343
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:01,897
- Oh my God.
- I didn't,

344
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:02,898
I didn't see it.

345
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,160
- Oh, look, she's fine.

346
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,032
Oh. People are such idiots.

347
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,337
They completely fly down
the street. It's terrifying.

348
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,948
- I didn't, I didn't see it.

349
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:10,776
- I know, I know. It's so scary.

350
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,951
But that's why we strap them in.

351
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,779
- You sure, you sure she's fine?

352
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,259
- Yeah, she, l-
look at her. She's beautiful.

353
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,218
Oh.

354
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,702
- Wait, I, I saw you
at the baby store.

355
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,923
- That's right, yes,
I do remember you. Hi.

356
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:29,795
- I had the baby.

357
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,579
- Well, congratulations.

358
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,580
- Thank you.

359
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:34,364
It's great.

360
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,368
It, it really, it really is.

361
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,078
- Hey, guys.

362
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:52,861
- Hey.

363
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:56,082
- I want you guys to meet, um...

364
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,912
Oh my god, I didn't even
catch your name. I'm so sorry.

365
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:00,913
- Jo.

366
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,697
- This is Jo, you guys.

367
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,481
- I know you.

368
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,135
"Love, Josephine."

369
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,658
- The French girl style.

370
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,661
The cheese souffle that
broke the internet.

371
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,839
- Oh my god! I cannot
believe that's you.

372
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,102
I'm such a fan. You're amazing.

373
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:19,061
I tried to make your
souffle for like a month.

374
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,237
- Oh, it's easy.
It's easy, truly.

375
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,543
- "It's easy, truly."

376
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,242
- I know. She's so chic, right?

377
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,853
- I haven't seen
your baby online yet.

378
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,463
Maybe I missed it?

379
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:32,161
- No, I haven't, I
haven't posted yet.

380
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:36,905
It's just, uh, I'm not
sure with the babies.

381
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:39,603
How do you do anything?

382
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,909
Ruby cries

383
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,085
a lot.

384
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,348
And I know, I know
babies cry. I know that.

385
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,481
But sometime it's just,

386
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,700
it's too much, no?

387
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,486
And you guys look so happy

388
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,445
and relaxed and rested,

389
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,841
and your, your babies
are, are so quiet.

390
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,888
They don't even cry.

391
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,193
What's your secret?

392
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,151
I mean...

393
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,981
- Trust your instincts.

394
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,117
- I'm not sure about the outfit.

395
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,901
- I don't think we should go.

396
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,729
- Come on.

397
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,689
It's just dinner.
Ruby will be fine.

398
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,953
- It's too much for your mother.

399
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:10,433
- Well, she raised me, right?

400
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:11,957
Look how great I turned out.

401
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,353
It's nice for her
to feel needed.

402
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,053
Besides, are we never
gonna have dinner again

403
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,489
alone for the rest of our lives?

404
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:23,838
- That was my plan?

405
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:29,800
- We need this.

406
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,248
- Oh, yes, you are.

407
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:47,427
Oh, she smiled at me.

408
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,299
Has she smiled before?

409
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,303
Oh, you had your first smile.

410
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,132
Ruby, you're so
smart. She's so smart.

411
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,004
- I missed it.

412
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,527
- Okay, well, there's
gonna be plenty of chances

413
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,790
to see her smile
and frown and cry

414
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:06,402
and roll her eyes in complete
disgust at her idiot parents.

415
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,709
So come. We're gonna be late.

416
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:09,666
Thanks, Mom.

417
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,277
- Okay.

418
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,800
- The, the, the
milk is in the fridge.

419
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,367
Just warm it up and
make sure to test it.

420
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,196
- We'll be fine. Just
go on, you lovebirds.

421
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:52,274
- You were right.
This is, this is nice.

422
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:56,017
- You see? Every now and
again, I have a good idea.

423
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,411
Not often. Like once a year.

424
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:00,500
On leap years.

425
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:10,640
Hey, what's up?

426
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:16,907
- I kind of feel like
I'm, I'm disappearing.

427
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,216
- Um...

428
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,785
Well, this is temporary.

429
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,831
You know, pretty soon,
you'll be back to work,

430
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,400
photo shoots of diapers,
baby food sponsorships.

431
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,708
You'll be moving a mile
a minute. Trust me.

432
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:36,188
Everyone goes through this.

433
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

434
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,888
You know, Freddy from work,
after his kid was born,

435
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,629
his wife got so freaked out,

436
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,935
she just picked lint
off the carpet all day.

437
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,286
Uh-huh, and Jim, Jim's
wife started buying

438
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,637
all kinds of tiny, crazy
cat figurines online.

439
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,726
- I haven't bought one tiny cat.

440
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,641
- I know.

441
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,948
Because you're gonna
be a great mom.

442
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,082
- You have puke on your jacket.

443
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,257
- I have what on my jacket?

444
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,432
- You have puke on your jacket.

445
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:04,390
- I have what on my jacket?

446
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:05,521
- Wait, I-

447
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:07,393
- What are you doing?

448
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,090
- Give it to me.
- No, no.

449
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:09,873
- Just put a little bit of-
- Control freak.

450
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,832
No. I'll get it.

451
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:13,964
Love you.

452
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:45,909
- Sweet, sweet Ruby.

453
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,654
Ruby.

454
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:55,702
Ruby.

455
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,791
Ruby.

456
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,670
- Pick up the fucking.

457
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,542
Doris, pick up
the fucking phone!

458
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:10,978
Sorry, I I...

459
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,762
- Whoa, whoa, what's happening?

460
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:15,200
- The monitor, the moni-

461
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,723
It's probably nothing-
- Jo, what's going on?

462
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,594
- but I just have
to go check on Ruby.

463
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:19,552
Give me the keys to the car.
- What are you talking-

464
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,119
- The key to the car!

465
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,555
- Jesus.

466
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:26,167
- Oh my god!
- Out of my way!

467
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,255
- I'm so sorry.

468
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,127
Jo, wait!

469
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,307
- It's okay. It was our
first time away from her.

470
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,612
We'll get better at it.

471
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,704
- What do you think it was?

472
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,666
- You know, I think it's
what my mom said it was.

473
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,059
I think she was, um,
putting a blanket on Ruby,

474
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,671
and she kicked over the iPad.

475
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:54,674
- But I heard whispering.

476
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:57,894
- Yeah, it's just my
mom whispering to Ruby.

477
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,115
- What was she telling her?

478
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:04,858
- Um...

479
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,774
"Sleep tight," probably.

480
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:13,519
- I'm...

481
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:15,956
I'm okay now.

482
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:16,957
- I know.

483
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:19,525
I know.

484
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,703
- I'm just gonna
go check on Ruby.

485
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,096
Okay?

486
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,292
Oh, sorry, Ruby.

487
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:49,729
It's okay.

488
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,165
It's just

489
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,166
Mommy.

490
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:57,867
Shh.

491
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,522
I won't leave you
again, I promise.

492
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,570
Okay? I won't leave you again.

493
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,224
I won't

494
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,183
ever leave you again.

495
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,098
Never.

496
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,194
Ow!

497
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,730
You bit me.

498
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:50,398
- Impalement,
strangulation, suffocation.

499
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,139
You sure that thing's secure?

500
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,972
I would not want that to fall
on her. Crush her like a bug.

501
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,975
I don't love the look at
these corners, and obviously,

502
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:04,194
you're gonna need to get
this construction cleaned up.

503
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,893
- We are close. I dunno
what's taking them so long.

504
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,373
- Total death trap.

505
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,896
- I know she's a little young

506
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,593
to worry about
all this now, but-

507
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,508
- Never too early
to start baby proofing.

508
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:16,381
- Yeah, and she,
she's very advanced.

509
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,034
She, she already has teeth.

510
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:23,779
Well, uh, I, I really want
our home to be safe from her.

511
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,128
- Safe for her.

512
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,087
- Yeah.

513
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,787
What did I say?

514
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,268
- It's
okay, I get it.

515
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:35,356
We had twins.

516
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,359
They almost killed me.

517
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,235
- Whoa! Come on, slowpoke!

518
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,762
- Oh, fuck, fuck!

519
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:17,806
Ruby!

520
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm sorry baby.

521
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,114
- Oh my god, Runaway
Ralph! Here you go.

522
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,463
- Oh, oh, thank you.

523
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,465
- You okay?
- God!

524
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,385
I need, I need a cigarette.

525
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,214
- Don't worry. It
gets so much easier, I promise.

526
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:36,346
- Running or the baby?

527
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,698
- Oh, you poor thing. Is
Ruby still crying a lot?

528
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:42,004
- Yeah, it's, it's strange, she,

529
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:46,008
she doesn't do it around other
people, but she, she cries.

530
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,575
- It's classic, right?

531
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:49,882
- Do you...

532
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:56,323
Do you ever feel like you're
baby's angry with you?

533
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,805
- I mean, when I take
more than five seconds

534
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,284
to do her bidding for her, yes.

535
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,286
She's completely
pissed all of the time.

536
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,768
- I mean more like
punishing you.

537
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:10,163
- Punishing me for what?

538
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,211
- I don't, I don't know.

539
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,737
- You know what I think?

540
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,784
I think that you really
need to go out and, like,

541
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:25,004
dance and get your
old self back.

542
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,919
We're actually all going
out for mom drinks later,

543
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,094
and I swear it's not

544
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,182
as terrible as it sounds.

545
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,705
- No, I can't.

546
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,533
That's exactly what
makes her angry.

547
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,143
- Where are you going Jo?

548
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:37,016
- Home. I, I need
to focus on home.

549
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,452
I'll see you around.

550
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:32,462
- Jo.

551
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,464
- I'm busy, Caroline.
Can't you see?

552
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,554
- Sorry, it's just that, um,

553
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:38,773
Ruby's crying.

554
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:41,646
- Babies cry.

555
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,085
- She's been crying
for over an hour.

556
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:51,481
- Fine.

557
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,396
- I'll get her, okay?

558
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:55,964
Fine, Ruby.

559
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,445
If that's what you
want, I'm coming.

560
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:04,364
I am not going to let you win.

561
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,279
I am not going

562
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:08,411
to let you win.

563
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,848
Do you hear me?

564
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:14,026
I'm not gonna let you win, Ruby.

565
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,419
I'm not gonna let you win.

566
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,421
I'm not gonna let you win!

567
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:26,952
- Hey.

568
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,867
What's the occasion?

569
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,999
- Nothing. I cooked.

570
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,306
- What is it?
- A surprise.

571
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,615
- Where's Ruby?

572
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,010
Jo?

573
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,542
Jo, wait, please. Come on, wait.

574
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:55,067
- Do you really think I'm crazy?

575
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:59,027
- No, I don't. I
don't think you're crazy.

576
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,987
Look, this is hard on me,
too. I'm fucking exhausted.

577
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:04,032
- Oh, I'm
sorry, but did,

578
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:07,949
did you make an entire
person inside your own body?

579
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:12,432
Don't you understand
that she's killing me?

580
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:15,217
- And I'm saying
that I wanna help.

581
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,875
I'll go.
- I'm fine.

582
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:23,443
- No. Let me, just this once.

583
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:27,360
- Okay. You see how you do.

584
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:28,361
Go.

585
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:49,774
Okay, Ruby.

586
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:36,690
- Okay, uh...

587
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,127
- I'm going out. You're
so good with Ruby.

588
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,999
You handle her for a night.

589
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,783
- Okay, well, can you tell
me where you're going.

590
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,046
- Out, I said.

591
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,527
- Jo, I, I don't think
you should go out.

592
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,181
- Why not?

593
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,487
Afraid to be alone with her?

594
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,054
- I'm dying to be
alone with her.

595
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,448
- So then, what's
the problem, hmm?

596
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:58,451
Dinner's on the stove, but you
already know that, I think.

597
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:01,367
There is pumped milk in the
fridge for when Ruby's hungry.

598
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,369
But be careful
when you feed her.

599
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,371
She bites.

600
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:34,400
- Ruby.

601
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,057
- You came!

602
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:42,712
- Yeah.

603
00:46:42,887 --> 00:46:44,018
- Hi!

604
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,629
- I needed to get out.

605
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,936
- Your hair looks so cute.

606
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,416
- It's falling out.

607
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:52,766
- Hormones are a bitch.

608
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,466
- Ruby.

609
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:01,340
- Jo!

610
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,953
Is it true that in France
the government pays for you

611
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,173
to rehab your vagina
after you have a baby?

612
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:09,870
- Oh, yes.

613
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,394
We, we have physical
therapy, yes.

614
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:14,614
- Tell us about your
childcare policies,

615
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,529
because they're
incredible, right?

616
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:20,359
- Yes, yeah, we have, uh,
we do have childcare, yes.

617
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:21,839
- This country-
- I can't even imagine.

618
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,797
- Hey! This country's bullshit.

619
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:24,972
- Yeah.
- Everyone, note it.

620
00:47:25,146 --> 00:47:26,452
- I thought you all, I mean,

621
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,193
you seem like you're
doing so well.

622
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,412
- Yeah,
we're miserable.

623
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:32,588
We are zombies.

624
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:34,068
We are furious.

625
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,026
- Uh-huh.

626
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,638
- Honestly, the thing
that really helped me

627
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:41,510
through all of this
was eating my placenta.

628
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:42,947
I made it into a bolognese.

629
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,906
- You're scaring her!

630
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,907
- I'm not!

631
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:47,995
- I forgot mine.

632
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:49,518
- Let's dance!

633
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,433
- Mine is still
in the freezer.

634
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:08,450
- Pump and dump, baby!

635
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:09,669
- Yeah! Whoo!

636
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:52,799
- Okay.

637
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:07,248
I can't.

638
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,253
Give me a minute. Give
me a minute, please.

639
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:24,744
- What is that?

640
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,923
- It's Ruby.

641
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,075
- Hey, Jo, it's Shelly.

642
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:52,990
Where were you tonight?

643
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,730
I thought, um, you were
gonna come to mom drinks.

644
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:55,993
We really missed you.

645
00:49:57,255 --> 00:50:00,214
- Fuck.

646
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,059
- Where were you?

647
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,018
- I fell asleep
in a parking lot.

648
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:26,197
Yeah, I wanted to go to a
bar to have a drink, and I,

649
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:28,808
I fell asleep before
I even came inside.

650
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:33,291
I slept for the
first time in ages.

651
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,164
- You couldn't even call?

652
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,992
- I fell asleep, like I said.

653
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,866
Where's Ruby?

654
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,433
- She's upstairs in her crib.

655
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:47,348
She's fine. Don't go
up there and wake her.

656
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,350
We actually had a really
nice night together.

657
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:50,308
- Good.

658
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:52,658
I'm happy for you.

659
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:53,659
- Yeah.

660
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:56,749
Well, it was nice to get
some time with her, finally.

661
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:58,359
- Okay, well, I shouldn't,

662
00:50:58,533 --> 00:50:59,882
I shouldn't have come
back at all, then.

663
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,580
- Yeah, okay, that's
not what I meant.

664
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:05,236
I'm going to work. Someone
around here has to.

665
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:16,638
- This is typical man.

666
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:19,206
You like to spend time
with her on your terms,

667
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,078
but then you leave whenever
it becomes inconvenient.

668
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:22,601
- All I said was
it was nice, okay?

669
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:24,168
You're the one who
left all night.

670
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,387
- I got tired, okay? I
made a mistake one time.

671
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:27,649
- Was it?

672
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:28,650
A mistake?

673
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:30,957
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

674
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,132
You seem pretty unhappy.

675
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,090
- I love her.

676
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:36,441
You don't believe me?

677
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,400
Hey, do not walk away
from me, Spencer!

678
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,836
Talk to me!

679
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,360
- Great. You
fucking woke her up!

680
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:43,317
- Ah!

681
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:47,234
It's okay, Ruby, I
heard you. Just stop.

682
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:58,202
There you go.

683
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,159
Oh.

684
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:03,511
Sorry.

685
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:05,774
Sorry, baby.

686
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:06,775
I'm sorry.

687
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,008
- Well, the great news
is she's grabbing.

688
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,010
That's a big milestone.

689
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,186
It's time to get one
of those activity gyms

690
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,535
so that she can grab things that

691
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:29,407
don't cause you bodily harm.

692
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:32,192
- So there's nothing
wrong w- with her?

693
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:33,672
- She's perfectly fine.

694
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:36,109
- Uh, I'm sure you
saw, but she has teeth.

695
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,851
- Well, it's a little
early for that,

696
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:40,548
but all babies are different.

697
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:43,160
- And she she doesn't
seem angry to you?

698
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:47,425
- What about?

699
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,036
- No, nothing, I just, I mean...

700
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,475
I would understand if
she's disappointed.

701
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,825
- In what? She's a baby.

702
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,959
She's not old enough
to be disappointed.

703
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:04,224
Um...

704
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:07,706
I'm gonna be right back.

705
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:10,448
- Wait, w- where are you going?

706
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:13,451
- Turns out she's
due for some shots.

707
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,104
This will only take a minute.

708
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:55,710
- "What is your baby
trying to tell you?"

709
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,800
"What is your baby
trying to tell you?"

710
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:02,151
- Oh, she's
completely lost her marbles.

711
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,284
I worry that she
might .

712
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:15,208
- Hey, it's okay,
it's okay. Shh.

713
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,646
- Hey, hey,
you can't leave!

714
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,258
- Uh, it's, it's not a good
time, really. We'll come back.

715
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:36,969
I was wrong.

716
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:38,318
- Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing here?

717
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:39,580
- About everything.
- Jesus.

718
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,103
Ah, I'm sorry.

719
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,584
- Shh.
- She's not angry with me.

720
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,934
Of course she's not
angry. She's not.

721
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:49,373
That was completely insane.
There's nothing wrong with her.

722
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:51,375
She's, she's not
trying to hurt me.

723
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:52,941
- Yeah.
- She,

724
00:54:53,115 --> 00:54:55,248
she's trying to
tell me something.

725
00:54:57,032 --> 00:55:00,862
It makes sense, you know,
understanding your baby's cues.

726
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:04,039
The, the, the
crying, the grabbing.

727
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:08,870
She's trying desperately
to communicate with us,

728
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:10,655
and the only way she can-

729
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:12,874
- So what is she
trying to communicate?

730
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,399
- I don't know.

731
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:16,704
I don't know.
- Uh-huh?

732
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,926
- I think she, she may
be trying to warn us.

733
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,232
- What did the doctor say?

734
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,454
- I didn't tell him about this.
He'll just think I'm crazy.

735
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:31,328
- Yeah, I'm gonna
take you home, Jo.

736
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:35,506
Uh, I don't want
her here, and, uh,

737
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,640
when we, when we get back,
maybe we can figure this out,

738
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:41,773
and maybe you can get
a little rest, hmm?

739
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,690
- I don't need to rest.

740
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:47,779
- Well, you can't figure this
out when you're exhausted.

741
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:48,736
- I'm not.

742
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:52,305
- Hey, look at me.

743
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:55,352
I love you.

744
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:57,702
- I love you too.

745
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:01,880
- Okay.

746
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:06,711
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

747
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:09,148
It's okay. Good girl.

748
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:12,760
Good girl.

749
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:28,559
- Hi.

750
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,735
I thought I would
bring you some tea.

751
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:35,609
- Spencer shouldn't have
bothered you, really.

752
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,699
I can take care of Ruby myself.

753
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:43,225
- Ruby isn't the only one
who needs taking care of.

754
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,226
- Thanks.

755
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:49,710
- Oh, that's a classic.

756
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:52,887
- Yeah, I, I didn't think
I'd need these books, but-

757
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:54,323
- I know.

758
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:55,847
It's hell.

759
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:56,848
- What?

760
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,982
- Well, I told you about
when Spencer was a baby.

761
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:02,680
- Yes. You said he was a crier.

762
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,725
- Oh, much worse than that.

763
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:07,772
You know, this was back in my
day. Men didn't do anything.

764
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:12,124
I was all alone, and
everybody kept saying,

765
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:16,258
wasn't I so happy, and wasn't
my baby a miraculous thing,

766
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,259
and I,

767
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:19,261
I felt so

768
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:23,352
guilty because of
course I loved him,

769
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,920
but also,

770
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:30,795
I hated him.

771
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:34,799
I would dream about
all the terrible things

772
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:36,757
that could happen to him,

773
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:37,889
and at first I thought it
was because I was scared.

774
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,065
I mean, all moms are scared.

775
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,372
But then I realized

776
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,725
I

777
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:48,769
wished for it.

778
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:53,992
I did.

779
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,563
And one night, Spencer's
father was on another

780
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,610
business trip, and Spencer
was crying and crying,

781
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,047
and I tried everything,
but nothing worked.

782
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,659
And I was hot.

783
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:13,968
Summer. It was dark outside,
middle of the night.

784
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,405
And I,

785
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,842
I remember I just,

786
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:22,324
I prayed to God
for someone to come

787
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,979
and just take this
baby away from me

788
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:28,940
so that I could go back
to being who I was before.

789
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:30,332
But also, I knew,

790
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,075
I knew that wasn't gonna happen.

791
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:35,076
I was,

792
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:37,252
I was trapped.

793
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:42,823
I put Spencer in his crib,

794
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:45,391
and he was crying and crying
and crying and crying,

795
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:49,308
like a hammer, like,
um, in my head,

796
00:58:49,482 --> 00:58:50,309
and I,

797
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:57,316
I went down into the kitchen
and I got our sharpest knife.

798
00:58:58,273 --> 00:58:58,926
- To kill yourself?

799
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,884
- To kill him.

800
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,236
I went back upstairs,

801
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:06,847
and

802
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,762
he was

803
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:09,720
just-

804
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:12,200
- Stop.

805
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:13,201
Just stop.

806
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:17,075
- Well, obviously,
I came to my senses.

807
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,729
I mean, I didn't do anything.

808
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:20,165
- You have to stop.

809
00:59:22,384 --> 00:59:23,821
- Yes, and that's the problem.

810
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:28,042
We can't talk about these
things, not even to each other.

811
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:31,568
We can't admit it. We
can't even look at it.

812
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:35,223
And so

813
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,272
it grows stronger.

814
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:09,170
- Ruby.

815
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:13,348
- Hey, hey, um, my mom's
staying over, so you can...

816
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:50,559
- Voila.

817
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,431
- I'm not that hungry.

818
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:56,478
- Well, it's croissant, but
we have to keep you fed.

819
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,959
Oh, and your friend
dropped by, Shelly.

820
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,266
She dropped off a loaf cake.

821
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,661
You're looking more
rested already.

822
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:07,141
- I didn't hear Ruby
wake up in the night.

823
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:08,447
I guess she slept through.

824
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:11,058
- Good job, Ruby!

825
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,844
- You didn't hear her, did you?

826
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,324
- Not a a peep.

827
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:18,500
Of course, I'm downstairs
on the sofa, so.

828
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,024
Not that I'm complaining.

829
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:23,027
I just get a little
twinge in my back.

830
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,376
I know the guest
room isn't finished,

831
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:27,161
but I would love a

832
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:28,772
firmer mattress.

833
01:01:28,946 --> 01:01:30,164
- I was thinking how
helpful you've been

834
01:01:30,338 --> 01:01:32,950
that first night
Spencer and I went out.

835
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,995
- I know, you were so worried.

836
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:37,432
- What was in those magic bars?

837
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:40,653
I went into labor
at the very night.

838
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:42,916
- I hope you don't think-

839
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:46,093
- Oh, what would I think? Just
a typical nervous mom, no?

840
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:50,576
- I promise you,
there's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

841
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,318
I keep a very watchful eye.

842
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:55,755
- So do I.

843
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,152
- Jo, the guys are finally
done with the gutters,

844
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:03,371
if you wanna go give
it a quick look.

845
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,069
- I'll watch Ruby.

846
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,592
- I'll be back in two minutes.

847
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,333
Don't take her out of the swing.

848
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:22,521
Do you want me to go up there?

849
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:24,653
- No, no, no, I just-

850
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:25,829
Oh my god!
- Sorry.

851
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,308
- That was a complete accident.

852
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:29,658
What is wrong with you idiots?

853
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,530
- Is everything okay?

854
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:34,315
- All is well. I'll just
take Ruby out for a walk.

855
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:37,971
- It's okay.

856
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:41,061
Let her go.

857
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,635
- Hey,
this is Spencer.

858
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,377
I can't make him on
the phone right now.

859
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:55,510
- Shelly.

860
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,164
Shelly!

861
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:58,165
Oh god.

862
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,038
- Are you okay?

863
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,605
What is going on?

864
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:07,131
- Just close, close the
door. Close it quickly.

865
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:08,959
They may be following me.

866
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:10,351
Oh fuck.
- Shit.

867
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,658
Is this about Spencer? Shit!

868
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,529
Did he find out?

869
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:16,967
Jo, please tell me
you didn't tell him.

870
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,404
- Tell him what?

871
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:20,622
- Tell him what?

872
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,450
Were you too drunk to remember,

873
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:24,670
or was it just
that insignificant?

874
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,324
- I thought that was a dream.

875
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:28,935
It was not a dream?

876
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,677
- A dream? Should I be
taking that as a compliment?

877
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,635
I texted you and texted you,

878
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,507
and then I baked you a loaf
cake and I leave you a card,

879
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:37,944
and you just
completely ghosted me.

880
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:39,424
- I'm sorry, I didn't-
- And it's like,

881
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:41,034
you know what, I get
it, because I'm married.

882
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,167
I don't wanna blow up my
life over this, either.

883
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,082
But you're French. I thought
we could be French about it.

884
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,954
Like, what's the big
fucking deal? Fuck!

885
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:50,304
I'm just in a really, like,
vulnerable place right now

886
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:52,350
with my sexuality
and my femininity,

887
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:54,831
and I feel like fucking
shit all the time,

888
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:56,441
and you doing that to me
makes me feel even worse,

889
01:03:56,615 --> 01:03:58,312
and I don't even have
anyone I can talk to

890
01:03:58,486 --> 01:04:00,358
about how I'm feeling right now.

891
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:03,622
- I do really wanna talk about
this. I really apologize.

892
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:06,407
But I need to make a
quick, quick phone call.

893
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,934
- Seriously? Just be quiet,
because my baby's asleep.

894
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:14,024
- Hey,
this is Spencer.

895
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,373
I can't make it to
the phone right now,

896
01:04:15,547 --> 01:04:16,853
so leave your message
after the beep.

897
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:19,333
- Hey, it's me. I
need to talk to you.

898
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:22,293
R- Ruby is in danger.
I am in danger.

899
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:26,863
Please just, just send
everyone away, and let us talk.

900
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:11,385
Can I see?

901
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:12,604
- No.

902
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:13,779
- What's your secret?

903
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,913
- Just your instincts.

904
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:18,958
- There were no babies.

905
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:24,007
There were never any babies.

906
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:02,088
What are you doing in there?

907
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:03,698
- Nothing.

908
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,178
Nothing, I just...

909
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:07,441
Just

910
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,488
give me my baby.

911
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,404
- Oh my god, she's so perfect.

912
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:18,365
She's really just a
perfect little angel, Jo.

913
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:22,282
- Why did you come up to me

914
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:25,720
that first day at
the baby store?

915
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,592
- What are you talking about?

916
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:29,246
- I was a good target, huh?

917
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,031
Clearly had no idea
what I was in for.

918
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,121
Now,

919
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:37,863
you give her back to me.

920
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:41,214
- Jo, let's be honest.

921
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:46,045
She's ruining your life.

922
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:51,833
- Give her back to me.

923
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:52,834
- No.

924
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,011
No.

925
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:56,882
- Give her back to me.
- No.

926
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:58,666
And you have to be careful.
You don't wanna break her.

927
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,407
- Give me my baby.

928
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:01,887
- No!
- Give me-

929
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:03,454
- Ow, shit!

930
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:06,674
She fucking bit me!

931
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:19,687
- Good job, Ruby. Good job.

932
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:20,775
You did it.

933
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,039
We did it.

934
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:24,866
I won't let them take you.

935
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:37,966
- Are you okay?

936
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,490
- I'm okay, for now.
- Yeah?

937
01:07:39,664 --> 01:07:41,318
Okay, thank God.
I was so worried.

938
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,102
- We don't have much time.
- Okay, that's okay.

939
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:44,364
I was so worried,
I thought that you-

940
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:46,018
- They want Ruby.

941
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:48,064
- Who wants her.
- They want,

942
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,717
they want her, I
don't know what for.

943
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:51,545
- Okay, I don't understand.

944
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,286
- I can't explain you,
but you have to trust me.

945
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,246
- Okay, okay. Who wants Ruby?

946
01:08:05,646 --> 01:08:07,387
- You're still
wearing your apron?

947
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:10,216
- Yeah, well, your message
said you were in danger,

948
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,827
so I came as fast as I could.

949
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,091
And she's okay,

950
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:18,442
so no more sneaking around
where you don't belong.

951
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,185
Stay here. I'm gonna go
upstairs and get cleaned up.

952
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,841
You're gonna stay right here,

953
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:31,846
and then, when I come back
down, we can talk, okay, mm-hmm?

954
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:33,674
You gonna be okay?

955
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:34,762
- Yes, sure.

956
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:38,549
- Good.

957
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,946
Stay here.

958
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,214
- Oh!

959
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:52,693
I'm sorry, Jo.

960
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:54,565
I'm so sorry to barge in.

961
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:57,394
I drove all the way home and
realized that I forgot my keys.

962
01:08:58,395 --> 01:08:59,787
Are you all right?

963
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:02,442
- No, I'm, uh, I'm
fine.

964
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:06,185
I'm fine. I was, uh, I was
just about to make dinner.

965
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,405
- Oh, good, I'm starved.
Here, I'll watch her.

966
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,276
Here. Come on, little on.

967
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,364
Come to Googoo.

968
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,236
Oh!

969
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,890
Hi. She's
getting so big.

970
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,110
She's getting such a big girl.

971
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:56,061
Oh.

972
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,631
- This is the best
bolognese I have ever had.

973
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:05,897
- Yeah, well, you'll have
to give her the recipe.

974
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,900
- Oh, it's pretty simple.

975
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,294
All you have to do is
throw yourself into it.

976
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,567
- Jo, we,
uh, we need to talk.

977
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,222
- You don't like it?

978
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,050
- You need a rest.

979
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:31,923
A longer rest.

980
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:34,186
- Maybe a few weeks away.

981
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,927
Some professional help.

982
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:38,103
There's medications
you can take and, uh,

983
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:41,541
yeah, Ruby will be fine.

984
01:10:41,715 --> 01:10:42,847
Mom's offered to help.

985
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:48,679
- It's true that
I, I've been really

986
01:10:50,507 --> 01:10:51,769
struggling and I,

987
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:57,470
I didn't realize, nobody
helps mothers in this country.

988
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,822
- We're gonna
get you the help you need.

989
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:04,434
- Professionals
are coming.

990
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:07,698
They're on their way now
to meet you and take you-

991
01:11:07,872 --> 01:11:08,829
- Without Ruby?

992
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,178
- You said it yourself.

993
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:12,659
Ruby's in danger.

994
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,794
So they're gonna take you
to a place you can rest.

995
01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:19,100
We'll bring all your things.

996
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:32,810
- Can I...

997
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,684
Can I at least say
goodbye to her?

998
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,604
- Of course.

999
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,827
- Ruby, say goodbye to Mommy.

1000
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:55,136
Say bye to Mommy.

1001
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,576
I'm gonna miss you.

1002
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:10,804
I'm gonna miss you.

1003
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:15,418
Don't move!

1004
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:16,462
Just don't.

1005
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:20,858
You think you can get
rid of me so easily?

1006
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,732
You want me to believe
that I'm crazy,

1007
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:29,083
but I know what you're doing.

1008
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:30,563
I know the truth.

1009
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:32,478
I know.

1010
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:36,352
A mother's instincts never lie.

1011
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:41,574
How could you? How
could you do this to us?

1012
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:44,664
Your own daughter.

1013
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:47,145
I hate you.

1014
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,887
I don't know what this is.

1015
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,019
I don't know what
you want her for.

1016
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:55,458
But I promise this, you
will never have her.

1017
01:12:56,981 --> 01:13:00,114
I will never, never
let her go. Never.

1018
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:10,081
Shit.

1019
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:20,613
- Jo, open the door!
Open the fucking door!

1020
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,486
Jo, open the door!

1021
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,791
Open the door!

1022
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:27,228
Jo! Come on, come on!

1023
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,187
Don't fucking do this, Jo!

1024
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:30,841
Jo, open the door!

1025
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,626
Come on, come on!

1026
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,454
Don't fucking do this, Jo!

1027
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:37,543
Stop the fucking car, Jo!

1028
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:40,416
Stop, stop the
fucking car! Stop!

1029
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:42,505
Jo!

1030
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:43,810
Come on!

1031
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:45,725
Stop the car. Come on!

1032
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:46,683
Jo!

1033
01:13:50,774 --> 01:13:52,993
- Shh. It's okay, Ruby.

1034
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,995
It's, it's okay.

1035
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:56,475
It's okay, Ruby.

1036
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:57,433
Shh.

1037
01:13:58,303 --> 01:13:59,826
Shh.

1038
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,611
It's okay, Ruby.

1039
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:08,531
Shh.

1040
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:38,952
We're okay.

1041
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:40,824
We're okay.

1042
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:10,462
Ruby?

1043
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,440
Where is Ruby?

1044
01:15:48,456 --> 01:15:49,283
Ruby.

1045
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:53,113
Ruby?

1046
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:54,201
Where is Ruby?

1047
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,986
- She's okay.

1048
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,423
She's okay.

1049
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,992
You just get well now, okay?

1050
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:04,603
- I thought...

1051
01:16:04,777 --> 01:16:07,432
- I know.
- I thought she was...

1052
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:08,781
I thought that you were,

1053
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:11,915
you were n- not...

1054
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:14,918
I don't know anymore.
- Shh.

1055
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:16,615
You just rest up, okay?

1056
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:51,824
- The
visions, psychotic episodes?

1057
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:52,782
- Gone.

1058
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:05,795
Auditory hallucinations?

1059
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:06,665
The crying in your head?

1060
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,232
- No.

1061
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:16,849
- Paranoia?
Conspiracy theories?

1062
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,155
- I think we're
gonna go to the park.

1063
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:19,591
We can all go to the park.

1064
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:21,898
- Monsters?

1065
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:28,252
- Only me.

1066
01:17:30,733 --> 01:17:32,909
It all seemed so real.

1067
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:35,041
- It is real.

1068
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:37,217
Postpartum is real.

1069
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,177
And it's not your fault.

1070
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:45,051
- And if they come back?

1071
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,837
The visions?

1072
01:17:48,011 --> 01:17:50,143
- I
know you're afraid.

1073
01:17:50,317 --> 01:17:52,668
Just take it moment by moment.

1074
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:55,453
You get through the first
night, and then the next,

1075
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:58,412
and then it gets easier.

1076
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,376
- Ready.

1077
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,465
- Okay.

1078
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:13,471
I'll get this.

1079
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:18,258
Wait till you see Ruby.

1080
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:21,261
She's scooting across the
floor on her little bum bum.

1081
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:25,831
And no words yet, but she's
just babbling away.

1082
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:28,268
And finally, she is
sleeping through the night,

1083
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:31,707
which was such a
relief, obviously.

1084
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:35,885
- Thanks.

1085
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:37,713
- For what?

1086
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:40,019
- Ruby.

1087
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:45,721
I, I don't know what we
would've done without you.

1088
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,812
- It's nothing.

1089
01:18:57,689 --> 01:18:59,169
- My mother died; I was,

1090
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:01,780
I was only a baby.

1091
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,435
- I know.

1092
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:08,831
- So I couldn't call you Mom.

1093
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,357
And I still can't.

1094
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:17,361
- It's okay.

1095
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:19,755
It's okay.

1096
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:45,389
- Go ahead.

1097
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:47,695
It's all right.

1098
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:08,194
- Uh, I have to go unpack.

1099
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:56,286
- Ruby should
go through the night.

1100
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,855
- I'll spend some time
with her in the morning.

1101
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:04,816
- She loves you.

1102
01:21:07,688 --> 01:21:09,299
- How?

1103
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:10,996
After all I've done?

1104
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:12,955
- You're her mother.

1105
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:17,829
You know,

1106
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,877
when the police arrived at
the scene of the accident,

1107
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:23,400
you were barely conscious.

1108
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:27,317
Car was crushed.

1109
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:32,148
Nobody knows how, but somehow,

1110
01:21:33,671 --> 01:21:35,499
you managed to crawl
out of your seat.

1111
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,025
You crawled back to Ruby.

1112
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,115
And when they found you,

1113
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,728
you were covering her,

1114
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:50,340
protecting her.

1115
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,127
- I'm scared.

1116
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,001
- Then...

1117
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:11,100
Let's just get through tonight.

1118
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:24,765
- Hey.

1119
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,950
I'm coming, Ruby.

1120
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:08,592
- Ruby.

1121
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,183
- Everything's gonna be okay.

1122
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:35,271
Shh.

1123
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:39,710
Shh.

1124
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,756
It's okay, Ruby.

1125
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,236
It's okay, Ruby.

1126
01:23:45,194 --> 01:23:46,369
All right.

1127
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:47,326
Shh.

1128
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,286
All right. Shh.

1129
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:53,724
Everything's gonna be okay.

1130
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:57,467
Everything's gonna be okay.

1131
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,995
That's what you wanted.

1132
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:10,958
Just give me one minute
to make your bottle.

1133
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:14,527
Yeah, it will just
be a minute, Ruby.

1134
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:17,487
Everything is gonna
be okay, Ruby.

1135
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:33,677
Please, Ruby.

1136
01:24:35,374 --> 01:24:37,898
Please. You can do this.

1137
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:52,391
Yeah, Ruby can be patient.

1138
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:54,741
Yeah.

1139
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,615
Shut up, Ruby!

1140
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:01,792
You just stop your crying.

1141
01:25:01,966 --> 01:25:04,534
You stop fucking crying!

1142
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:05,926
Make it stop.

1143
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,112
Hey!

1144
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:18,765
Hey!

1145
01:25:18,939 --> 01:25:20,158
Ruby!

1146
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,511
Hey!

1147
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:28,427
Hey!

1148
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,301
Stop!

1149
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,578
Ruby!

1150
01:25:53,844 --> 01:25:54,671
Ruby!

1151
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:58,153
No!

1152
01:25:59,197 --> 01:26:00,198
No!

1153
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:02,722
No!

1154
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:34,493
You can't have her.

1155
01:26:41,892 --> 01:26:44,547
You're a terrible mother.

1156
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:48,551
She doesn't want you

1157
01:26:49,987 --> 01:26:51,162
as her mother.

1158
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:56,428
- I'm not afraid of you.

1159
01:27:05,176 --> 01:27:06,395
I'm not afraid.

1160
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:08,875
I'm not.

1161
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:10,877
Come here.

1162
01:27:12,618 --> 01:27:13,402
Come.
