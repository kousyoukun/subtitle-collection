It's-it's barely anything, just people from work, and Caroline's helping.

10
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:53,824

你是说那张脸?
You mean that face?

14

我应该做什么表情?这张脸吗?

这张脸吗?我恨你。

这张脸。

17
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:11,234
别再取笑我了!

00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:15,978
你疯了吗?停!
Are you crazy? Stop!

21
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,458
小心。我要打破这个。
Careful. I'm gonna break this.

我动不了。
I can't move.

25
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,037
容易得多。
Much easier.

26
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,735
不，不，不。
No, no, no, no.

27
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:34,997
不。
No.

28
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,609
我动不了了。
I can't, I can't move.

29
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:42,004
我就像一只倒立的乌龟。
I'm like a turtle on its, on its back.

30
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,005
你像只乌龟?
You're like a turtle?

31
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:46,704
我就像乌龟-乌龟?-在它的背上。
I'm like a turtle- - A turtle? - On its back.

32

33
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,571
我的天啊!你能从那里下来吗?

来吧。我扶你下来。

-结束了。-谢谢。
- It's done. - Thank you.

38
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,519
好吧，你觉得怎么样?
Okay, what do you think?

39
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,086
好了。
Nice.

40
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,787
现在完美了。
Now it's perfect.

41
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,576
乔!

而且离市区开车非常快。

我简直不敢相信。
I can't believe it.

45
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,540
哇!我的天啊。
Whoa! Oh my god.

46
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,238

还有人想喝气泡苹果酒吗?

乔。你能帮我们一下吗?

57
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,219
是的,是的。

58
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:10,092
敬有史以来最好的女老板。

你是一个企业家，一个领导者。

61

You launched the online shop, you moved upstate, you did this insane renovation, by the way, all the while answering every single one of our readers' comments personally.

62
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,417
对了，你知道的，造一个人。
And oh, by the way, you know, making a human.

63
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,571
如果我们不是绝对地爱你，我们都会恨你。
We would all hate you if we did not absolutely love you.

64
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,596

我知道，我知道，我告诉自己我不会哭，但我真的会想你的。
I know, I know, I said, I told myself I was not gonna cry, but I'm really gonna miss you.

70
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,088
谢谢，但我哪也不去。
Oh, thanks, but I'm not going anywhere.

71
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,830
没有什么不同。它只是个婴儿。
Nothing's going to be any different. It's just a baby.

72
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,529
你知道他们到底有多大吗?
How big are they even, you know?

73
00:05:55,703 --> 00:06:00,055
就像一点，一点，一点甜甜圈，一点奶油蛋糕。
It's like a little, a little, a little donut, a little brioche.

77
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,554
你怎么看?
What do you think?

78
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,904
我觉得它对我来说有点小。
I think it's a little small for me.

79
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,296
但这是你的颜色，不是吗?
But it's your color, no?

80
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,473
这是我的颜色，但是，
It is my color, but,

81
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,867
这样好多了，不是吗?
this is better, no?

82
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,178
哦!
Oh!

83
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:08,488
斯宾塞，看看这件毛衣。它是完美的。
Oh, Spencer, look at this sweater. It's perfect.

84
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,144
大日子是什么时候?
When's the big day?

85
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,234
什么?
What?

婴儿。

哦，呃，随时都有可能。
Oh, uh, any day now.

88
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,632
哦!
Aw!

89
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:23,807
你害怕吗?
Are you scared?

90
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,026
我应该害怕吗?
Should I be?

91
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,336
我能看看你的孩子吗?
Can I, can I see your baby?

92
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,470
不。
No.

93
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,167
你永远不会吵醒熟睡的婴儿。
You never wake a sleeping baby.

94
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,093
她拉住我的手。
And she stops my hand.

95
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:53,184
她拉住我的手，好像我有放射性似的。
She stops my hand like I'm, like I'm radioactive or something.

96
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,927
——啊。-就一小口。
- Ah. - Just a sip.

97
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,061
啊，我想知道会是这样。
Ah, I wonder that could be.

98
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,889
啊,嘘。她只是寂寞。
Ah, shh. She's just lonely.

99
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,063
啊,不!
Ah, no!

100
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:05,848

我只是开车路过。
I was just driving by.

104
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,514
不，不，没关系。请进。
No, no, it's fine. Come on in.

105

107
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:21,996
嗨,乔。
Hi, Jo.

108
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,214
这就跟你问声好！
Hi!

109
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,607
我为你做了这些。
I made these for you.

110
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,044
为了满足欲望。啊。
For the cravings. Ah.

111
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,218
一个尝试。
Try one.

112
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,310

花生酱，椰子，奶油糖，巧克力，樱桃碎，培根碎。
Peanut butter, coconut, butterscotch, chocolate, crushed maraschino cherries, and bacon bits.

117
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,194
谁知道呢?也许他们会引产。
Who knows? Maybe they'll induce labor.

118
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,326
谢谢你！
Thank you.

119
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,633
好吧。好了，我要走了。
All right. Well, I'm off.

120
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:54,550
你们好好享受你们最后的宝贵时光吧。
You two enjoy your last precious moments.

121

坐下，多丽丝。加入我们吧。

122
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:03,298
乔，我跟你说过无数次了，叫我妈妈。
Oh, Jo, I've told you a million times, call me Mom.

123
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:12,089
说到这个，我在想，我觉得奶奶不舒服。
Speaking of which, I was thinking, Grandma doesn't feel right to me.

Maybe Gaddy or Giddy, Momo or Mimi or Moomoo or Googoo or Gigi or Geegaw.

125
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,630
“等不及了……”
"Can't wait..."

126
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:55,350
哦，在里面坐好。妈妈在努力集中注意力。
Oh, settle down in there. Mommy's trying to concentrate.

127
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,577

00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,637
你拉屎了吗?
Have you pooped yet?

你忘了胎盘!
You forgot the placenta!

159
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,480
总比忘记孩子好吧?
Better than forgetting the baby, right?

160
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,177
我以为你想吃呢。
I thought you wanted to eat it.

161
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,658
婴儿吗?
The baby?

都是营养物质。

你的速度可以超过每小时两公里。

我有珍贵的货物。

00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:07,156
我希望当父亲不会让你变成一个神经质的老太太。
I hope fatherhood is not going to turn you into a nervous old lady.

175
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,550
亲爱的，你为什么这么说?
Now, why would you say that, deary?

这上面写着他们喜欢吮吸，襁褓和荡秋千。
Well, this says they like to suck, swaddle, and swing.

186
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,587
我不需要什么书斯宾塞
I don't need some book, Spencer.

187
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:18,548
上面写着"销量超过一百万册，所以。"
Well, it says, "Over one million copies sold, so."

188
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,855
这是个陈词滥调的建议。
It's a cliche advice.

189

好。

谁他妈大半夜的按门铃啊?
Who is ringing the doorbell in the middle of the fucking night?

197
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,005
我们是来排水沟的。

只是来装修房子的人。

我们会在外面。我们不会打扰你的。

206
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:46,157
我想我们的粉丝还在等宝宝照呢。
And hey, I think our followers are still waiting on a baby pic.

207
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:47,332

I could help you if it's easier. No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

211

乔，我想她又饿了。
Jo, I think she's hungry again.

214
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:29,810
大便。

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
好的。
Okay.

216

00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,415
是你逼她的。
Well, you made her.

232
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:10,720
我们创造了她。
We made her.

233
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,425
好的。
Okay.

234
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:42,578
啊!斯宾塞!
Ah! Spencer!

235
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:43,912
-怎么了，乔?——Ruby !
- What's going on, jo? - Ruby!

236
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,015
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

237
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:50,194
当然，我完全忘了。
Of course, I completely forgot.

238
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,632
我几个小时前就把露比放在婴儿床上了。
I put Ruby up in her crib hours before.

239
00:22:52,806 --> 00:23:01,554
我是说，乔脸上的表情…我一直都知道。你比我还害怕。
I mean, the look on Jo's face was... I knew all along. You were more scared than I was.

240
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:02,946
他对一切都很紧张。
He's nervous about everything.

241
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,905
我不是。
I am not.

00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,256
第一次的父母。恐惧是非常非常正常的。
First-time parents. The fears are very, very normal.

243
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,390
如果我可以问的话，还有一个问题。
Oh, one more question, though, if I may ask.

244
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,043
骨头是谁的?
The bone was who's?

245
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,481
斯宾塞是个屠夫。手工屠夫。
Spencer's a butcher. An artisanal butcher.

246
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,832
我不是手艺人……我是个屠夫。
I'm not an artisanal... I'm a butcher.

247
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:22,052
你知道，放养，他主要杀的是废物。
You know, free range, He mainly killed no waste.

248
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:31,061
不管怎样，重点是我们，我们很累，所以我们想也许现在是时候，你知道，进来看看，得到一点帮助。
Anyway, the point is that we, we were very tired- - So we thought that maybe this was the time to, you know, come in and just check in and just get a little help.

249
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:35,414
不，我们不需要，我们不需要帮助，只是。-只是来看看。
No, we don't, we don't really need help, but just to- - Just to check in, you know.

250
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:36,763
只是来登记一下。
Just to check in.

251
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,765
她经常哭。
She cries a lot.

252
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:42,290
好消息是她看起来棒极了。
Well, the good news is she looks fantastic.

253
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,379
没什么好担心的。
Nothing to worry about whatsoever.

254
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,163
婴儿哭了。
Babies cry.

255
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:51,908
这很难，但是，你知道的，等她18岁吧。
It's tough, but, you know, wait till she's 18.

256
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,955
那真是地狱。
That's really hell.

257
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,347
啊。
Ah.

258
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:59,655
看看你!
Look at you!

259
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,005
你真是个可爱的小家伙?
Oh, aren't you the sweetest little thing?

260
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,792
她是可爱的。
She's adorable.

261
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,753
我觉得她看起来有点瘦。她太瘦了吗?
I think she looks a little thin. Is she too thin?

262
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,190
医生说她完全正常。
The doctor said she's perfectly normal.

263
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,888
也许她饿了。
Maybe she's hungry.

264
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:22,634
哦!
Oh!

265
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:26,639
她有很强的吸力。
She's got quite a strong suck.

266
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:27,813
嘘。
Shh.

267
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,749
你知道吗，人们总是说新生儿很可爱。
You know, people always say that new babies are cute.

268
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,558
我觉得他们看起来都像外星人。
I think they all look like ET.

269
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:39,869
我的意思是，有些人认为ET很可爱，但我只是认为他是一个令人毛骨悚然的外星人，应该呆在自己的星球上，不要打扰我们其他人。
I mean, some people thought ET was cute, but I just thought he was a creepy alien that should stay on his own planet and leave the rest of us alone.

270
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:46,615
不管怎样，如果这能安慰你的话，我理解你的感受。
Anyway, if it's any consolation, I understand how you feel.

271
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,749
斯宾塞爱哭。
Spencer was a crier.

272
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:50,924
哦，是吗?
Oh, he was?

273
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:52,839
噢,是的。
Oh yeah.

274
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,425
妈妈，别跟她唠叨个没完。她是累了。
Mom, don't talk her ear off. She's tired.

275
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,470
-我没事。-谢谢，亲爱的。
- I'm fine. - Thank you, dear.

276
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,278
我干枯。
I'm parched.

277
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,802
我们刚听说露比很像你。
We're just hearing about how Ruby takes after you.

278
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,476
妈妈，你都跟她说了些什么?
Mom, what have you been telling her about?

279
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,632
没什么。你是个爱哭的人，真的。
Nothing. You were a crier, you were.

280
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,199
-我当时还是个婴儿。——所以呢?
- I was an infant. - So?

281
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,767
为自己的行为负责。
Take some responsibility for your own behavior.

282
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:13,860
妈妈，你要为自己的行为负责。我确实为自己的行为负责。那你为什么要责怪你为什么要吵架?
Mom, you take some responsibility for your behavior. I did take responsibility for my behavior. So why do you blame Why are you arguing?

283
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,514
我告诉过你，这是。
I told you, this is.

284
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:16,688
我上楼去。
I'll go upstairs.

285
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,170
呃，你没事吧?
Uh, will you be okay?

286
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,868
你会吗?
Will you?

287
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:29,396
好。
Well.

288
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,506
嘘。
Shh.

289
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,606
嘘。
Shh.

290
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,220
嘘。
Shh.

291
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,135
嘘。
Shh.

292
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,054
没事的，鲁比。
It's okay, Ruby.

293
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:23,972
没关系。
It's okay.

294
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:29,848
嘘。
Shh.

295
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,231
不，不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

296
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:05,405
Ruby !
Ruby!

297
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,235
Ruby ?
Ruby?

298
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,414
婴儿。你明白吗?
Baby. You're okay?

299
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:58,851
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

300
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,113
哦，是的，她很好。
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

301
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,898
-天啊。-我没，我没看见
- Oh my God. - I didn't, I didn't see it.

302
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,160
看，她很好。
Oh, look, she's fine.

303
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,032
哦。人们都是白痴。
Oh. People are such idiots.

304
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,487
他们完全在街上乱飞。这是可怕的。
They completely fly down the street. It's terrifying.

305
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,948
我没有，我没有看到。
I didn't, I didn't see it.

306
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:10,776
我知道，我知道。太可怕了。
I know, I know. It's so scary.

307
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,101
所以我们才把他们绑起来。
But that's why we strap them in.

308
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,779
你确定她没事吗?
You sure, you sure she's fine?

309
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,259
是啊，她，我，看看她。她是美丽的。
Yeah, she, I- look at her. She's beautiful.

310
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,391
哦。
Oh.

311
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,702
等等，我在婴儿用品店见过你。
Wait, I, I saw you at the baby store.

312
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,923
没错，是的，我记得你。嗨。
That's right, yes, I do remember you. Hi.

313
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:29,924
我生了孩子。
I had the baby.

314
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,579
好,祝贺你。
Well, congratulations.

315
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,753
谢谢你！
Thank you.

316
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:34,537
太棒了。
It's great.

317
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,368
真的，真的，真的。
It, it really, it really is.

318
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,078
嘿,家伙。
Hey, guys.

319
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:53,252
嘿。
Hey.

320
00:28:54,341 --> 00:29:00,026
我想让你们认识一下…天啊，我还不知道你叫什么。我很抱歉。
I want you guys to meet, um... Oh my god, I didn't even catch your name. I'm so sorry.

321
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:00,913
乔。
Jo.

322
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,697
这是乔，伙计们。
This is Jo, you guys.

323
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,481
我了解你。
I know you.

324
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,135
“爱,约瑟芬。”
"Love, Josephine."

325
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,658
法国女孩的风格。
The French girl style.

326
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,661
爆红网络的奶酪舒芙蕾。
The cheese souffle that broke the internet.

327
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,839
我的天啊!真不敢相信那是你。
Oh my god! I cannot believe that's you.

328
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,102
我是你的超级粉丝。你真了不起。
I'm such a fan. You're amazing.

329
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:19,061
我花了一个月时间给你做蛋奶酥。
I tried to make your souffle for like a month.

330
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,237
哦，很简单。这真的很简单。
Oh, it's easy. It's easy, truly.

331
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,543
“这很简单，真的。”
"It's easy, truly."

332
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,242
我知道。她很时髦，对吧?
I know. She's so chic, right?

333
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,896
我还没在网上看到你的孩子呢。
I haven't seen your baby online yet.

334
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,463
也许我错过了?
Maybe I missed it?

335
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:32,161
不，我还没有，我还没有发布。
No, I haven't, I haven't posted yet.

336
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:36,905
只是，孩子的事我不太确定。
It's just, uh, I'm not sure with the babies.

337
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:39,603
你怎么做事情?
How do you do anything?

338
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,085
鲁比经常哭。
Ruby cries a lot.

339
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,348
我知道，我知道婴儿会哭。我知道。
And I know, I know babies cry. I know that.

340
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:49,700
但有时候，这太过分了，不是吗?
But sometime it's just, it's too much, no?

341
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:59,841
你们看起来很开心，很放松，休息得很好，你们的宝宝也很安静。
And you guys look so happy and relaxed and rested, and your, your babies are, are so quiet.

342
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,888
他们甚至都不哭。
They don't even cry.

343
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,193
你的秘诀是什么?
What's your secret?

344
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:08,981
我的意思是……相信你的直觉。
I mean... Trust your instincts.

345
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,117
我对这身衣服不太确定。
I'm not sure about the outfit.

346
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,901
我觉得我们不应该去。
I don't think we should go.

347
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,902
来吧。
Come on.

348
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,689
只是晚餐而已。Ruby会没事的。
It's just dinner. Ruby will be fine.

349
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,953
你妈妈受不了了。
It's too much for your mother.

350
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:10,433
她养大了我，对吧?
Well, she raised me, right?

351
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:11,957
看看我现在有多棒。
Look how great I turned out.

352
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,353
她觉得被需要是件好事。
It's nice for her to feel needed.

353
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,507
再说了，我们这辈子都不能单独吃晚饭了吗?
Besides, are we never gonna have dinner again alone for the rest of our lives?

354
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:23,838
这就是我的计划?
That was my plan?

355
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:29,843
我们需要这个。
We need this.

356
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,248
哦，不，你是。
Oh, yes, you are.

357
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:47,427
哦，她对我笑了。
Oh, she smiled at me.

358
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,299
她以前笑过吗?
Has she smiled before?

359
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,303
你第一次笑了。
Oh, you had your first smile.

360
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,132
露比，你真聪明。她很聪明。
Ruby, you're so smart. She's so smart.

361
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,004
我错过了。
I missed it.

362
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:06,402
好吧，会有很多机会看到她微笑，皱眉，哭泣，翻白眼，对她的白痴父母表示完全的厌恶。
Okay, well, there's gonna be plenty of chances to see her smile and frown and cry and roll her eyes in complete disgust at her idiot parents.

363
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,709
所以。我们要迟到了。
So come. We're gonna be late.

364
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:09,666
谢谢,妈妈。
Thanks, Mom.

365
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,277
好的。
Okay.

366
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,931
牛奶在冰箱里。
The, the, the milk is in the fridge.

367
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,517
只要把它加热一下，一定要测试一下。
Just warm it up and make sure to test it.

368
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,196
我们会没事的。走吧，你们这对小情侣。
We'll be fine. Just go on, you lovebirds.

369
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:52,274
你说得对。这，这很好。
You were right. This is, this is nice.

370
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:56,017
你看到了什么?我时不时会有个好主意。
You see? Every now and again, I have a good idea.

371
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,411
不是很经常。大概一年一次。
Not often. Like once a year.

372
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:00,716
在闰年。
On leap years.

373
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:10,813
嘿，怎么了?
Hey, what's up?

374
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:16,907
我感觉我在消失。
I kind of feel like I'm, I'm disappearing.

375
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:24,785
嗯…好吧，这是暂时的。
Um... Well, this is temporary.

376
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:31,400
你知道吗，很快你就会回去工作，拍尿布的照片，赞助婴儿食品。
You know, pretty soon, you'll be back to work, photo shoots of diapers, baby food sponsorships.

377
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:34,708
你会以一分钟一英里的速度移动。相信我。
You'll be moving a mile a minute. Trust me.

378
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:36,188
每个人都会经历这些。
Everyone goes through this.

379
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,362
——真的吗?-是的。
- Really? - Yeah.

380
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:44,935
同事弗雷迪，他孩子出生后，他妻子吓坏了，她整天都在捡地毯上的线头。
You know, Freddy from work, after his kid was born, his wife got so freaked out, she just picked lint off the carpet all day.

381
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,637
还有吉姆，吉姆的妻子开始在网上买各种疯狂的迷你猫雕像。
Uh-huh, and Jim, Jim's wife started buying all kinds of tiny, crazy cat figurines online.

382
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,726
我一只小猫都没买过。
I haven't bought one tiny cat.

383
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,641
我知道。
I know.

384
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,948
因为你会是个好妈妈。
Because you're gonna be a great mom.

385
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,082
你的夹克上有呕吐物。
You have puke on your jacket.

386
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,336
我夹克上有什么?
I have what on my jacket?

387
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,582
你的夹克上有呕吐物。
You have puke on your jacket.

388
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:04,390
我夹克上有什么?
I have what on my jacket?

389
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:07,393
等等，我-你在做什么?
Wait, I- - What are you doing?

390
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,090
-给我。-不，不。
- Give it to me. - No, no.

391
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:09,873
-放一点。-控制狂
- Just put a little bit of- - Control freak.

392
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,832
不。我去拿。
No. I'll get it.

393
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:13,964
爱你。
Love you.

394
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:45,909
亲爱的，亲爱的露比。
Sweet, sweet Ruby.

395
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,654
Ruby。
Ruby.

396
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:55,702
Ruby。
Ruby.

397
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,791
Ruby。
Ruby.

398
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,670
把该死的捡起来。
Pick up the fucking.

399
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,542
多丽丝，快接电话!
Doris, pick up the fucking phone!

400
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:12,762
对不起，我…哇，哇，发生什么事了?
Sorry, I I... Whoa, whoa, what's happening?

401
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:16,873
监视器，莫尼-可能没什么-乔，怎么了?
The monitor, the moni- It's probably nothing- - Jo, what's going on?

402
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,594
但我得去看看露比。
But I just have to go check on Ruby.

403
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:21,119
把车钥匙给我。你在说什么车钥匙!
Give me the keys to the car. What are you talking The key to the car!

404
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,555
耶稣。
Jesus.

405
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:26,167
-我的天啊!-让开!
- Oh my god! - Out of my way!

406
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,341
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

407
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,127
乔,等等!
Jo, wait!

408
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,457
没关系。这是我们第一次离开她。
It's okay. It was our first time away from her.

409
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,612
我们会做得更好。
We'll get better at it.

410
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,704
你觉得是什么?
What do you think it was?

411
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,666
我觉得就像我妈妈说的那样。
You know, I think it's what my mom said it was.

412
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,671
我想她是在给露比盖毯子，然后踢翻了iPad。
I think she was, um, putting a blanket on Ruby, and she kicked over the iPad.

413
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:54,674
但我听到了耳语。
But I heard whispering.

414
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:57,894
没事，只是我妈在跟露比耳语。
Yeah, it's just my mom whispering to Ruby.

415
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,115
她对她说了什么?
What was she telling her?

416
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:07,774
嗯…可能是“睡个好觉”。
Um... "Sleep tight," probably.

417
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:16,042
我…我现在好了。
I'm... I'm okay now.

418
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,130
我知道。
I know.

419
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:19,698
我知道。
I know.

420
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,703
我去看看露比怎么样了。
I'm just gonna go check on Ruby.

421
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,270
好吗?
Okay?

422
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,292
哦，对不起，露比。
Oh, sorry, Ruby.

423
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:49,858
没关系。
It's okay.

424
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:52,339
是妈妈。
It's just Mommy.

425
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:57,867
嘘。
Shh.

426
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,522
我不会再离开你了，我保证。
I won't leave you again, I promise.

427
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,570
好吧?我不会再离开你了。
Okay? I won't leave you again.

428
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,183
我再也不会离开你了。
I won't ever leave you again.

429
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,271
从来没有。
Never.

430
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,194
噢!
Ow!

431
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,860
你咬了我。
You bit me.

432
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:50,398
刺穿，勒死，窒息。
Impalement, strangulation, suffocation.

433
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,139
你确定那东西安全吗?
You sure that thing's secure?

434
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,972
我可不想让她承担这个责任。把她像虫子一样碾碎。
I would not want that to fall on her. Crush her like a bug.

435
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:04,269
我不喜欢这些角落的样子，而且很明显，你得把这个建筑清理一下。
I don't love the look at these corners, and obviously, you're gonna need to get this construction cleaned up.

436
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,893
我们很接近了。我不知道他们怎么这么久。
We are close. I dunno what's taking them so long.

437
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,373
完全是死亡陷阱。
Total death trap.

438
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:13,508
我知道她现在担心这些有点小，但是-开始婴儿防护永远都不嫌早。
I know she's a little young to worry about all this now, but- - Never too early to start baby proofing.

439
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:16,381
是的，她，她很先进。
Yeah, and she, she's very advanced.

440
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,034
她，她已经长牙了。
She, she already has teeth.

441
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:23,779
我真的希望我们的家不受她的伤害。
Well, uh, I, I really want our home to be safe from her.

442
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,128
对她来说很安全。
Safe for her.

443
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
是的。
Yeah.

444
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,787
我说什么来着?
What did I say?

445
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,268
没关系，我明白。
It's okay, I get it.

446
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:35,442
我们有一对双胞胎。
We had twins.

447
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,359
他们差点杀了我。
They almost killed me.

448
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,235
哇!来吧，慢性子!
Whoa! Come on, slowpoke!

449
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,762
哦，操，操!
Oh, fuck, fuck!

450
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:17,936
Ruby !
Ruby!

451
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,417
对不起，宝贝。
I'm sorry baby.

452
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,151
天啊，逃跑的拉尔夫!给你。
Oh my god, Runaway Ralph! Here you go.

453
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,463
哦，哦，谢谢。
Oh, oh, thank you.

454
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,465
-你还好吗?——上帝!
- You okay? - God!

455
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,385
我需要，我需要一支烟。
I need, I need a cigarette.

456
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,214
别担心。我保证，事情会变得简单很多。
Don't worry. It gets so much easier, I promise.

457
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:36,346
跑步还是孩子?
Running or the baby?

458
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,698
哦，可怜的家伙。鲁比还经常哭吗?
Oh, you poor thing. Is Ruby still crying a lot?

459
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:46,008
是啊，很奇怪，她不在别人面前哭，但她会哭。
Yeah, it's, it's strange, she, she doesn't do it around other people, but she, she cries.

460
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,575
这很经典，对吧?
It's classic, right?

461
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:50,098
你……
Do you...

462
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:56,323
你有没有觉得你的宝宝在生你的气?
Do you ever feel like you're baby's angry with you?

463
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,284
我是说，当我花了超过五秒钟的时间替她办事，是的。
I mean, when I take more than five seconds to do her bidding for her, yes.

464
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,286
她一直都很生气。
She's completely pissed all of the time.

465
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,768
我是说更像是惩罚你。
I mean more like punishing you.

466
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:10,163
惩罚我什么?
Punishing me for what?

467
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,211
我不，我不知道。
I don't, I don't know.

468
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,737
你知道我怎么想吗?
You know what I think?

469
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:25,004
我觉得你真的需要出去，跳舞，找回原来的自己。
I think that you really need to go out and, like, dance and get your old self back.

470
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:29,268
我们待会要一起出去喝妈妈的酒，我发誓没听起来那么糟糕。
We're actually all going out for mom drinks later, and I swear it's not as terrible as it sounds.

471
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,705
不，我不能。
No, I can't.

472
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,533
这正是让她生气的地方。
That's exactly what makes her angry.

473
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,143
乔，你要去哪里?
Where are you going Jo?

474
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:37,016
家  我，我得把注意力放在家里。
Home. I, I need to focus on home.

475
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,452
回头见。
I'll see you around.

476
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:32,462
乔。
Jo.

477
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,464
我很忙，卡罗琳。你看不出来吗?
I'm busy, Caroline. Can't you see?

478
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,859
抱歉，只是露比在哭。
Sorry, it's just that, um, Ruby's crying.

479
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:41,732
婴儿哭了。
Babies cry.

480
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,085
她已经哭了一个多小时了。
She's been crying for over an hour.

481
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:51,481
很好。
Fine.

482
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,396
我去找她，好吗?
I'll get her, okay?

483
00:42:54,528 --> 00:42:55,964
很好,Ruby。
Fine, Ruby.

484
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,445
如果这是你想要的，我就来。
If that's what you want, I'm coming.

485
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:04,364
我不会让你赢的。
I am not going to let you win.

486
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:08,411
我不会让你赢的。
I am not going to let you win.

487
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,848
你听到了吗?
Do you hear me?

488
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:14,026
我不会让你赢的，露比。
I'm not gonna let you win, Ruby.

489
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,419
我不会让你赢的。
I'm not gonna let you win.

490
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,421
我不会让你赢的!

491
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:26,952
嘿。
Hey.

492
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,867
是什么场合?
What's the occasion?

493
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,999
没什么。我煮熟的。
Nothing. I cooked.

494
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,306
-什么事?-一个惊喜。
- What is it? - A surprise.

495
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,615
Ruby在哪儿?
Where's Ruby?

496
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,183
乔?
Jo?

497
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,542
乔，请等一下。来吧，等等。
Jo, wait, please. Come on, wait.

498
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:55,067
你真的认为我疯了吗?
Do you really think I'm crazy?

499
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:59,027
不，我不喜欢。我不认为你疯了。
No, I don't. I don't think you're crazy.

500
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,137
听着，这对我来说也很难。我他妈的累死了。
Look, this is hard on me, too. I'm fucking exhausted.

501
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:07,949
不好意思，你在自己身体里造了一个完整的人吗?
Oh, I'm sorry, but did, did you make an entire person inside your own body?

502
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:12,432
你不明白她在杀我吗?
Don't you understand that she's killing me?

503
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:15,217
我是说我想帮忙。
And I'm saying that I wanna help.

504

我去。我很好。

505
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:23,443
不。让我，就这一次。

506
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:27,360
好的。你看你是怎么做的。
Okay. You see how you do.

507
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:28,534
走了。
Go.

508
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:49,774
好的,Ruby。
Okay, Ruby.

509
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:39,127
好吧,呃…我要出去。你和露比相处得真好。
Okay, uh... I'm going out. You're so good with Ruby.

510
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,999
你来照顾她一晚上。
You handle her for a night.

511
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,933
好吧，那你能告诉我你要去哪吗。
Okay, well, can you tell me where you're going.

512
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,046
出去，我说。
Out, I said.

513
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,527
乔，我觉得你不该出去。
Jo, I, I don't think you should go out.

514
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,181
为什么不呢?
Why not?

515
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,487
害怕和她单独在一起?
Afraid to be alone with her?

516
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,054
我太想和她单独在一起了。
I'm dying to be alone with her.

517
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,448
那么，还有什么问题呢?

518
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:58,451
晚饭在炉子上，但我想你已经知道了。
Dinner's on the stove, but you already know that, I think.

519
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:01,367
冰箱里有奶，露比饿了可以喝。
There is pumped milk in the fridge for when Ruby's hungry.

520
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,369
但喂她的时候要小心。
But be careful when you feed her.

521
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
她咬。
She bites.

522
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:34,400
Ruby。
Ruby.

523

它掉出来了。
It's falling out.

529
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:52,766
荷尔蒙是个婊子。

530
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,509
Ruby。
Ruby.

00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:01,513
乔!

532
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:08,173
在法国，政府真的会在你生完孩子后为你的阴道修复买单吗?
Is it true that in France the government pays for you to rehab your vagina after you have a baby?

533
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:09,870
哦,是的。
Oh, yes.

534
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,394
是的，我们有物理治疗。
We, we have physical therapy, yes.

535
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:16,529
跟我们说说你们的育儿政策吧，因为它们太不可思议了，对吧?
Tell us about your childcare policies, because they're incredible, right?

536
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:20,359
是的，是的，我们有孩子，是的。
Yes, yeah, we have, uh, we do have childcare, yes.

537
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:21,989
-这个国家-我简直无法想象
- This country- - I can't even imagine.

538
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,797
嘿!这个国家就是扯淡。

539

-是的。-大家注意。

540
00:47:25,146 --> 00:47:28,193
我以为你们，我是说，你们看起来都很好。
I thought you all, I mean, you seem like you're doing so well.

541
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,412
是的，我们很痛苦。
Yeah, we're miserable.

542
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:32,588
我们是僵尸。

00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:34,068
我们非常愤怒。
We are furious.

544
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,242
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

545
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:41,510
说实话，真正帮我度过这一切的是吃我的胎盘。
Honestly, the thing that really helped me through all of this was eating my placenta.

546
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:42,947
我把它做成了肉酱面。
I made it into a bolognese.

547
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,906
你吓到她了!
You're scaring her!

548
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,907

好的。
Okay.

561
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:07,465
我不能。
I can't.

562
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,253
给我一分钟。请给我一分钟。
Give me a minute. Give me a minute, please.

563
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:24,744
那是什么?
What is that?

564
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,923
Ruby。
It's Ruby.

565
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,075
嗨，乔，我是雪莉。
Hey, Jo, it's Shelly.

566
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:52,990
你今晚去哪儿了?
Where were you tonight?

567
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,880
我以为，你会来陪妈妈喝酒。
I thought, um, you were gonna come to mom drinks.

568
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:55,993
我们真的很想你。
We really missed you.

569
00:49:57,255 --> 00:50:00,214
他妈的。
Fuck.

570
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,059
你在哪里?
Where were you?

571
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,018
我在停车场睡着了。
I fell asleep in a parking lot.

572
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:28,808
是啊，我想去酒吧喝一杯，我还没进门就睡着了。
Yeah, I wanted to go to a bar to have a drink, and I, I fell asleep before I even came inside.

573
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:33,291
这么多年来我第一次睡着了。
I slept for the first time in ages.

574
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,164
你连个电话都不能打?
You couldn't even call?

575
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,992
我说了，我睡着了。
I fell asleep, like I said.

576
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,866
Ruby在哪儿?
Where's Ruby?

577
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,433
她在楼上她的婴儿床里。
She's upstairs in her crib.

578
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:47,348
她很好。别上去吵醒她。
She's fine. Don't go up there and wake her.

579
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,350
我们昨晚在一起过得很愉快。
We actually had a really nice night together.

580
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:50,524
好。
Good.

581
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:52,658
我为你感到高兴。
I'm happy for you.

582
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:53,832
是的。
Yeah.

583
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:56,899
好吧，终于有时间和她在一起了。
Well, it was nice to get some time with her, finally.

584
00:50:56,923 --> 00:51:00,033
好吧，我不应该，我根本就不应该回来。
Okay, well, I shouldn't, I shouldn't have come back at all, then.

585
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,580
好吧，我不是这个意思。
Yeah, okay, that's not what I meant.

586
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:05,236
我要去工作了。总得有人知道。
I'm going to work. Someone around here has to.

587
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:16,638
这就是典型的男人。
This is typical man.

588
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:21,228
你喜欢按照自己的方式和她在一起，但一旦不方便，你就会离开。
You like to spend time with her on your terms, but then you leave whenever it becomes inconvenient.

589
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:22,612
我只是说这很好，好吗?
All I said was it was nice, okay?

590
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:24,168
是你一整晚都没来。
You're the one who left all night.

591
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,387
我累了，好吗?有一次我犯了个错误。
I got tired, okay? I made a mistake one time.

592
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:27,649
是吗?
Was it?

593
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:28,823
一个错误?
A mistake?

594
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:30,957
-什么意思?-我不知道。
- What do you mean? - I don't know.

595
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,132
你看起来很不开心。
You seem pretty unhappy.

596
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,306
我爱她。
I love her.

597
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:36,441
你不相信我?
You don't believe me?

598
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,400
别离开我，斯宾塞!
Hey, do not walk away from me, Spencer!

599
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,836
跟我说话!
Talk to me!

600
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,360
太好了。你他妈的把她吵醒了!
Great. You fucking woke her up!

601
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:43,534
啊!
Ah!

602
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:47,234
没事，露比，我听到了。停下来。
It's okay, Ruby, I heard you. Just stop.

603
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:58,202
好了。
There you go.

604
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,376
哦。
Oh.

605
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:03,684
对不起。
Sorry.

606
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:05,774
对不起,宝贝。
Sorry, baby.

607
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:06,948
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

608
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,008
好消息是她在抓人。
Well, the great news is she's grabbing.

609
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,010
这是一个重大的里程碑。
That's a big milestone.

610
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:29,407
是时候买一个健身房了，这样她就可以拿一些不会对你身体造成伤害的东西。
It's time to get one of those activity gyms so that she can grab things that don't cause you bodily harm.

611
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:32,192
所以她没有什么问题?
So there's nothing wrong w-with her?

612
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:33,672
她很好。
She's perfectly fine.

613
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:36,109
你肯定看到了，但她有牙齿。
Uh, I'm sure you saw, but she has teeth.

614
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,548
现在说这个有点早，但每个宝宝都不一样。
Well, it's a little early for that, but all babies are different.

615
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:43,160
她她在你看来不生气吗?
And she she doesn't seem angry to you?

616
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:47,425
关于什么?
What about?

617
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:54,475
不，没什么，我只是…如果她失望了，我能理解。
No, nothing, I just, I mean... I would understand if she's disappointed.

618
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,825
在什么?她是个婴儿。
In what? She's a baby.

619
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,959
她还没到失望的年龄。
She's not old enough to be disappointed.

620
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:04,224
嗯…
Um...

621
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:07,706
我马上就回来。
I'm gonna be right back.

622
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:10,448
等等，你要去哪?
Wait, w-where are you going?

623
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:13,451
结果她要去打针了。
Turns out she's due for some shots.

624
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,104
这只需要一分钟。
This will only take a minute.

625
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:55,710
“你的宝宝想告诉你什么?”
"What is your baby trying to tell you?"

626
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,800
“你的宝宝想告诉你什么?”
"What is your baby trying to tell you?"

627
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:02,151
哦，她完全失去理智了。
Oh, she's completely lost her marbles.

628
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,284
我担心她会。
I worry that she might.

629
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:15,208
嘿，没事，没事。嘘。
Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Shh.

630
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,646
嘿，嘿，你不能走!
Hey, hey, you can't leave!

631
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,258
现在，现在不是时候，真的。我们会回来的。
Uh, it's, it's not a good time, really. We'll come back.

632
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:36,969
我错了。
I was wrong.

633
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:38,468
哇，哇，你在这里做什么?
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing here?

634
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:39,580
-什么都说。——耶稣。
- About everything. - Jesus.

635
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:41,103
啊，对不起。
Ah, I'm sorry.

636
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,584
——嘘。-她没有生我的气。
- Shh. - She's not angry with me.

637
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,934
她当然不生气。她不是。
Of course she's not angry. She's not.

638
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:49,373
这简直是疯了。她没有什么问题。
That was completely insane. There's nothing wrong with her.

639
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:51,375
她，她不是想伤害我。
She's, she's not trying to hurt me.

640
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:55,248
-是的。-她，她想告诉我一些事
- Yeah. - She, she's trying to tell me something.

641
00:54:57,032 --> 00:55:00,862
理解宝宝的暗示是有道理的。
It makes sense, you know, understanding your baby's cues.

642
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:04,039
哭啊，抓啊。
The, the, the crying, the grabbing.

643
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:12,874
她拼命地想和我们交流，而她唯一能。-那她想和我们交流什么?
She's trying desperately to communicate with us, and the only way she can- - So what is she trying to communicate?

644
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,399
我不知道。
I don't know.

645
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:16,704
我不知道。Uhhuh吗?
I don't know. Uhhuh?

646
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,926
我觉得她可能是想警告我们。
I think she, she may be trying to warn us.

647
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,232
医生怎么说?
What did the doctor say?

648
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,454
我没有告诉他这件事。他只会认为我疯了。
I didn't tell him about this. He'll just think I'm crazy.

649
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:31,328
我送你回家，乔。
Yeah, I'm gonna take you home, Jo.

650
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:41,773
我不希望她在这里，等我们回来，也许我们能解决这个问题，也许你也能休息一下，好吗?
Uh, I don't want her here, and, uh, when we, when we get back, maybe we can figure this out, and maybe you can get a little rest, hmm?

651
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,690
我不需要休息。
I don't need to rest.

652
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:47,929
当你筋疲力尽的时候，你是想不出答案的。
Well, you can't figure this out when you're exhausted.

653
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:48,953
我不是。
I'm not.

654
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:52,305
嘿，看着我。
Hey, look at me.

655
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:55,525
我爱你。
I love you.

656
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:57,918
我也爱你。
I love you too.

657
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,053
好的。
Okay.

658
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:06,711
嘘，嘘，嘘。
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

659
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:09,148
没关系。好姑娘。
It's okay. Good girl.

660
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:12,760
好姑娘。
Good girl.

661
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:28,559
嗨。
Hi.

662
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,735
我想给你带点茶。
I thought I would bring you some tea.

663
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:35,609
斯宾塞不该打扰你的，真的
Spencer shouldn't have bothered you, really.

664
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,699
我可以自己照顾鲁比。
I can take care of Ruby myself.

665
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:43,225
露比不是唯一需要照顾的人。
Ruby isn't the only one who needs taking care of.

666
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
谢谢。
Thanks.

667
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:49,710
哦，那是经典。
Oh, that's a classic.

668
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:54,323
是啊，我以为我不需要这些书，但是-我知道。
Yeah, I, I didn't think I'd need these books, but- - I know.

669
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:55,847
这是地狱。
It's hell.

670
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,021
什么?
What?

671
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,982
我跟你说过斯宾塞小时候的事。
Well, I told you about when Spencer was a baby.

672
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:02,680
是的。你说他爱哭。
Yes. You said he was a crier.

673
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,725
哦，比那糟多了。
Oh, much worse than that.

674
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:07,772
这是我年轻的时候。男人们什么也没做。
You know, this was back in my day. Men didn't do anything.

675
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:25,920
我孤身一人，每个人都在说，我是不是很幸福，我的孩子难道不是一个奇迹吗，我感到很内疚，因为我当然爱他，但同时，
I was all alone, and everybody kept saying, wasn't I so happy, and wasn't my baby a miraculous thing, and I, I felt so guilty because of course I loved him, but also,

676
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:30,924
我恨他。
I hated him.

677
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:38,039
我会梦见所有可能发生在他身上的可怕的事情，起初我以为这是因为我害怕。
I would dream about all the terrible things that could happen to him, and at first I thought it was because I was scared.

678
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,065
我是说，所有的妈妈都很害怕。
I mean, all moms are scared.

679
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,372
但后来我意识到
But then I realized

680
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,899
我许了个愿。
I Wished for it.

681
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:54,165
我做到了。
I did.

682
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:06,047
一天晚上，斯宾塞的父亲又出差了，斯宾塞哭个不停，我试了各种方法，但都没用。
And one night, Spencer's father was on another business trip, and Spencer was crying and crying, and I tried everything, but nothing worked.

683
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,659
我很热。
And I was hot.

684
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:13,968
夏天。半夜的时候，外面很黑。
Summer. It was dark outside, middle of the night.

685
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,842
我记得我只是，
And I, I remember I just,

686
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:28,940
我向上帝祈祷，希望有人能把这个孩子从我身边带走，这样我就能变回以前的我。
I prayed to God for someone to come and just take this baby away from me so that I could go back to being who I was before.

687
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:34,075
但我也知道，我知道那是不可能的。
But also, I knew, I knew that wasn't gonna happen.

688
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:37,252
我被困住了。
I was, I was trapped.

689
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:57,316
我把斯宾塞放在他的婴儿床上，他一直哭啊哭啊哭，就像锤子一样，在我脑子里，然后我，我下楼去厨房拿了我们最锋利的刀。
I put Spencer in his crib, and he was crying and crying and crying and crying, like a hammer, like, um, in my head, and I, I went down into the kitchen and I got our sharpest knife.

690
00:58:58,273 --> 00:58:58,926
自杀?
To kill yourself?

691
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,100
杀了他。
To kill him.

692
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:12,200
我回到楼上，他就。-别说了。
I went back upstairs, and he was just- - Stop.

693
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:13,374
停下来。
Just stop.

694
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:17,075
显然，我恢复理智了。
Well, obviously, I came to my senses.

695
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,729
我什么都没做。
I mean, I didn't do anything.

696
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:20,165
你必须停下来。
You have to stop.

697
00:59:22,384 --> 00:59:23,821
是的，这就是问题所在。
Yes, and that's the problem.

698
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:28,042
我们不能谈这些事，甚至不能对彼此说。
We can't talk about these things, not even to each other.

699
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:31,568
我们不能承认。我们甚至不能看它。
We can't admit it. We can't even look at it.

700
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:35,396
所以
And so

701
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,272
它变得更强大。
it grows stronger.

702
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:09,170
Ruby。
Ruby.

703
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:13,348
嘿，嘿，嗯，我妈妈在这过夜，所以你可以…
Hey, hey, um, my mom's staying over, so you can...

704
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:50,559
瞧。
Voila.

705
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,431
我没那么饿。
I'm not that hungry.

706
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:56,478
是牛角面包，但我们得让你吃饱。
Well, it's croissant, but we have to keep you fed.

707
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,959
你朋友来过了，谢莉。
Oh, and your friend dropped by, Shelly.

708
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,266
她扔下一块大蛋糕。
She dropped off a loaf cake.

709
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,661
你看起来休息得好多了。
You're looking more rested already.

710
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:07,141
我没听见露比在夜里醒来。
I didn't hear Ruby wake up in the night.

711
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:08,447
我猜她睡过头了。
I guess she slept through.

712
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:11,058
做得好，鲁比!
Good job, Ruby!

713
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,844
你没听到她说的话吧?
You didn't hear her, did you?

714
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,324
一点动静也没有。
Not a a peep.

715
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:18,500
当然，我在楼下沙发上，所以。
Of course, I'm downstairs on the sofa, so.

716
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,024
我并不是在抱怨。
Not that I'm complaining.

717
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:23,027
我只是后背有点刺痛。
I just get a little twinge in my back.

718
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:28,772
我知道客房还没装修好，但我想要个结实点的床垫。
I know the guest room isn't finished, but I would love a firmer mattress.

719
01:01:28,946 --> 01:01:32,950
我在想我和斯宾塞约会的第一个晚上你帮了我多大的忙。
I was thinking how helpful you've been that first night Spencer and I went out.

720
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,995
我知道，你很担心。
I know, you were so worried.

721
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:37,432
那些魔法棒里有什么?
What was in those magic bars?

722
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:40,653
那天晚上我就分娩了。
I went into labor at the very night.

723
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:46,093
我希望你不会认为。-我会怎么想?就是个典型的紧张妈妈，不是吗?
I hope you don't think- - Oh, what would I think? Just a typical nervous mom, no?

724
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:50,576
我向你保证，没什么好担心的。
I promise you, there's absolutely nothing to worry about.

725
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,318
我一直保持警惕。
I keep a very watchful eye.

726
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:55,755
我也是。
So do I.

727
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:03,371
乔，排水沟终于清理完了，你想去看看吗。
Jo, the guys are finally done with the gutters, if you wanna go give it a quick look.

728
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,069
我来照看鲁比。
I'll watch Ruby.

729
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,592
我两分钟后回来。
I'll be back in two minutes.

730
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,333
别带她离开秋千。
Don't take her out of the swing.

731
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:22,546
你想让我上去吗?
Do you want me to go up there?

732
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:25,829
不不不，我只是-天啊!——对不起。
No, no, no, I just- Oh my god! - Sorry.

733
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,308
那完全是个意外。
That was a complete accident.

734
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:29,658
你们这些白痴怎么了?
What is wrong with you idiots?

735
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,530
一切都好吗?
Is everything okay?

736
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:34,315
一切都很好。我就带露比出去走走。
All is well. I'll just take Ruby out for a walk.

737
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,014
没关系。
It's okay.

738
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:41,061
让她走。
Let her go.

739
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,635
我是斯宾塞。
Hey, this is Spencer.

740
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:52,377
我现在没法让他接电话。
I can't make him on the phone right now.

741
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:55,510
雪莱。
Shelly.

742
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,164
雪莉!
Shelly!

743
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:58,338
哦,上帝。
Oh god.

744
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,038
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

745
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,605
这是怎么回事?
What is going on?

746
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:07,131
关上，把门关上。赶快关上。
Just close, close the door. Close it quickly.

747
01:03:07,305 --> 01:03:08,959
他们可能在跟踪我。
They may be following me.

748
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:10,351
哦,他妈的。大便。
Oh fuck. Shit.

749
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,658
是因为斯宾塞吗?狗屎!
Is this about Spencer? Shit!

750
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,529
他发现了吗?
Did he find out?

751
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:16,967
乔，拜托告诉我你没告诉他。
Jo, please tell me you didn't tell him.

752
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,404
告诉他什么?
Tell him what?

753
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:20,622
告诉他什么?
Tell him what?

754
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,670
你是醉得不记得了，还是这事无关紧要?
Were you too drunk to remember, or was it just that insignificant?

755
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,324
我以为那是个梦。
I thought that was a dream.

756
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:28,935
这不是梦吗?
It was not a dream?

757
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,677
一场梦吗?我该把这当成是恭维吗?
A dream? Should I be taking that as a compliment?

758
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:37,944
我不停地给你发短信，还给你烤了个蛋糕，给你留了张卡片，而你就像幽灵一样把我消失了。
I texted you and texted you, and then I baked you a loaf cake and I leave you a card, and you just completely ghosted me.

759
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:41,184
-我很抱歉，我没有-你知道吗，我懂了，因为我结婚了
- I'm sorry, I didn't- - And it's like, you know what, I get it, because I'm married.

760
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,167
我也不想因为这件事毁了我的生活。
I don't wanna blow up my life over this, either.

761
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,232
但你是法国人。我以为我们可以像法国人一样。
But you're French. I thought we could be French about it.

762
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:47,954
这有什么大不了的?他妈的!
Like, what's the big fucking deal? Fuck!

763
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:56,591
我现在真的很脆弱因为我的性取向和女人味，我一直觉得自己糟透了，你这么对我让我感觉更糟，
I'm just in a really, like, vulnerable place right now with my sexuality and my femininity, and I feel like fucking shit all the time, and you doing that to me makes me feel even worse,

764
01:03:56,615 --> 01:04:00,358
我甚至找不到一个可以倾诉我现在感受的人。
and I don't even have anyone I can talk to about how I'm feeling right now.

765
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:03,622
我真的很想谈谈这件事。我真的很抱歉。
I do really wanna talk about this. I really apologize.

766
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:06,407
但我得打个非常非常快的电话。
But I need to make a quick, quick phone call.

767
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,934
严重吗?安静点，我的孩子睡着了。
Seriously? Just be quiet, because my baby's asleep.

768
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:14,024
我是斯宾塞。
Hey, this is Spencer.

769
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:16,987
我现在不方便接电话，请在哔的一声后留言。
I can't make it to the phone right now, so leave your message after the beep.

770
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:19,333
嘿，是我。我需要和你谈谈。
Hey, it's me. I need to talk to you.

771
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:22,293
露比有危险。我有危险。
R- Ruby is in danger. I am in danger.

772
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:26,863
求你了，让大家都走吧，我们好好谈谈。
Please just, just send everyone away, and let us talk.

773
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:11,515
我能看看吗?
Can I see?

774
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:12,604
不。
No.

775
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:13,779
你的秘诀是什么?
What's your secret?

776
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,913
只是你的直觉。
Just your instincts.

777
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:18,958
没有婴儿。
There were no babies.

778
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:24,007
从来没有孩子。
There were never any babies.

779
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:00,043
♬你的小女孩，你的小女孩♬
♪ Your little girl, your little girl ♪

780
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:02,088
你在里面做什么?
What are you doing in there?

781
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:03,698
什么都没有。
Nothing.

782
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:10,488
没什么，我只是…把我的孩子还给我。
Nothing, I just... Just give me my baby.

783
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,404
天啊，她太完美了。
Oh my god, she's so perfect.

784
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:18,365
她真是个完美的小天使，乔。
She's really just a perfect little angel, Jo.

785
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:25,720
第一天在婴儿店你为什么要来找我?
Why did you come up to me that first day at the baby store?

786
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,592
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

787
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:29,246
我是个好目标，对吧?
I was a good target, huh?

788
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,031
显然不知道我要做什么。
Clearly had no idea what I was in for.

789
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:37,863
现在，把她还给我。
Now, you give her back to me.

790
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:41,214
乔，说实话吧。
Jo, let's be honest.

791
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:46,045
她毁了你的生活。
She's ruining your life.

792
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:51,833
把她还给我。
Give her back to me.

793
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,008
不。
No.

794
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,011
不。
No.

795
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:56,882
-把她还给我——没有。
- Give her back to me. - No.

796
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:58,816
你必须小心。你不会想伤害她的。
And you have to be careful. You don't wanna break her.

797
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,407
把我的孩子还给我。
Give me my baby.

798
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:03,454
——不!-给我-该死!
- No! - Give me- Ow, shit!

799
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:06,674
她他妈的咬了我!
She fucking bit me!

800
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:19,687
做得好，鲁比。好工作。
Good job, Ruby. Good job.

801
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:20,861
你做到了。
You did it.

802
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,039
我们做到了。
We did it.

803
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:24,866
我不会让他们带走你的。
I won't let them take you.

804
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:37,966
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

805
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,490
-我暂时还好。——是吗?
- I'm okay, for now. - Yeah?

806
01:07:39,664 --> 01:07:41,318
好的，感谢上帝。我很担心。
Okay, thank God. I was so worried.

807
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,252
-我们时间不多了。-好吧，没关系。
- We don't have much time. - Okay, that's okay.

808
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:46,018
我很担心，我以为你。-他们想要露比。
I was so worried, I thought that you- - They want Ruby.

809
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:49,717
-谁要她。-他们要，他们要她，我不知道为什么
- Who wants her. - They want, they want her, I don't know what for.

810
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:51,545
好吧，我不明白。
Okay, I don't understand.

811
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,436
我无法向你解释，但你必须相信我。
I can't explain you, but you have to trust me.

812
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,246
好吧,好吧。谁想要鲁比?
Okay, okay. Who wants Ruby?

813
01:08:05,646 --> 01:08:07,387
你还穿着围裙?
You're still wearing your apron?

814
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:12,827
是啊，你留言说你有危险，所以我尽快赶来了。
Yeah, well, your message said you were in danger, so I came as fast as I could.

815
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:18,442
她也没事，所以别再偷偷摸摸去不该去的地方了。
And she's okay, so no more sneaking around where you don't belong.

816
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,185
待在这里。我上楼去梳洗一下。
Stay here. I'm gonna go upstairs and get cleaned up.

817
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,841
你就待在这里
You're gonna stay right here,

818
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:31,846
等我回来的时候，我们可以谈谈，好吗?
and then, when I come back down, we can talk, okay, mm-hmm?

819
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:33,674
你没事吧?
You gonna be okay?

820
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:34,848
是的,当然。
Yes, sure.

821
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:38,722
好。
Good.

822
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,120
待在这里。
Stay here.

823
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,214
哦!
Oh!

824
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:52,693
对不起，乔。
I'm sorry, Jo.

825
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:54,565
我很抱歉闯进来。
I'm so sorry to barge in.

826
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:57,394
我一路开车回家，发现我忘了带钥匙。
I drove all the way home and realized that I forgot my keys.

827
01:08:58,395 --> 01:08:59,787
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

828
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:02,442
不，我，我很好。
No, I'm, uh, I'm fine.

829
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:06,185
我很好。我，我正准备做晚饭。
I'm fine. I was, uh, I was just about to make dinner.

830
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,405
太好了，我饿死了。来，我看着她。
Oh, good, I'm starved. Here, I'll watch her.

831
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,276
在这里。加油，加油。
Here. Come on, little on.

832
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,450
来咕咕吧。
Come to Googoo.

833
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,890
你好。她长这么大了。
Hi. She's getting so big.

834
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:18,110
她要养这么大的女儿了。

835
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,631
这是我吃过的最好吃的肉酱面。
This is the best bolognese I have ever had.

836
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:05,897
好吧，你得把秘方给她。
Yeah, well, you'll have to give her the recipe.

837
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,900
哦，很简单。
Oh, it's pretty simple.

838
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,294
你要做的就是全身心投入。
All you have to do is throw yourself into it.

839
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,567
乔，我们得谈谈。
Jo, we, uh, we need to talk.

840
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,222
你不喜欢吗?
You don't like it?

841
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,050
你需要休息。
You need a rest.

842
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:31,923
更长的休息时间。
A longer rest.

843
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:34,186
也许几周后。
Maybe a few weeks away.

844
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,927
一些专业的帮助。
Some professional help.

845
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:41,541
你可以服用一些药物，露比会没事的。
There's medications you can take and, uh, yeah, Ruby will be fine.

846
01:10:41,715 --> 01:10:42,847
妈妈愿意帮忙。
Mom's offered to help.

847
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:57,470
的确，我一直在努力，我没有意识到，在这个国家，没有人帮助母亲。
It's true that I, I've been really struggling and I, I didn't realize, nobody helps mothers in this country.

848
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,822
我们会给你提供你需要的帮助。
We're gonna get you the help you need.

849
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:04,434
专业人士来了。
Professionals are coming.

850
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:08,872
他们正在来接你的路上-没有露比吗?
They're on their way now to meet you and take you- - Without Ruby?

851
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,178
你自己也说过。
You said it yourself.

852
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:12,702
露比有危险。
Ruby's in danger.

853
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,794
他们会带你去一个可以休息的地方。
So they're gonna take you to a place you can rest.

854
01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:19,100
我们会把你的东西都拿来。
We'll bring all your things.

855
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:32,983
我可以……
Can I...

856
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,684
至少让我跟她说声再见吧?
Can I at least say goodbye to her?

857
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,604
当然。
Of course.

858
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,827
露比，跟妈妈说再见。
Ruby, say goodbye to Mommy.

859
01:11:53,178 --> 01:11:55,136
跟妈妈说再见。
Say bye to Mommy.

860
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,576
我会想你的。
I'm gonna miss you.

861
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:10,804
我会想你的。
I'm gonna miss you.

862
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:15,418
不要动!
Don't move!

863
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:16,592
只是不喜欢。
Just don't.

864
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:20,858
你以为你能轻易摆脱我吗?
You think you can get rid of me so easily?

865
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:29,083
你想让我相信我疯了，但我知道你在做什么。
You want me to believe that I'm crazy, but I know what you're doing.

866
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:30,563
我知道真相。
I know the truth.

867
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:32,695
我知道。
I know.

868
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:36,352
母亲的直觉从不说谎。
A mother's instincts never lie.

869
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:41,574
你怎么能这样?你怎么能这样对我们?
How could you? How could you do this to us?

870
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:44,664
你自己的女儿。
Your own daughter.

871
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:47,145
我恨你。
I hate you.

872
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,887
我不知道这是什么。
I don't know what this is.

873
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,019
我不知道你找她做什么。
I don't know what you want her for.

874
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:55,458
但我保证，你永远得不到她。
But I promise this, you will never have her.

875
01:12:56,981 --> 01:13:00,114
我永远，永远不会让她走。从来没有。
I will never, never let her go. Never.

876
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:10,254
大便。
Shit.

877
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:20,613
乔，开门!他妈的把门打开!
Jo, open the door! Open the fucking door!

878
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,486
乔，开门!
Jo, open the door!

879
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,791
开门!
Open the door!

880
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:27,228
乔!加油，加油!
Jo! Come on, come on!

881
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,187
别这样，乔!
Don't fucking do this, Jo!

882
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:30,841
乔，开门!
Jo, open the door!

883
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,626
加油，加油!
Come on, come on!

884
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,454
别这样，乔!
Don't fucking do this, Jo!

885
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:37,543
停下该死的车，乔!
Stop the fucking car, Jo!

886
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:40,416
停车，他妈的停车!停!
Stop, stop the fucking car! Stop!

887
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:42,505
乔!
Jo!

888
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:43,810
来吧!
Come on!

889
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:45,725
停车。来吧!
Stop the car. Come on!

890
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:46,899
乔!
Jo!

891
01:13:50,774 --> 01:13:52,993
嘘。没事的，鲁比。
Shh. It's okay, Ruby.

892
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,995
没关系，没关系。
It's, it's okay.

893
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:56,475
没事的，鲁比。
It's okay, Ruby.

894
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:57,649
嘘。
Shh.

895
01:13:58,303 --> 01:13:59,826
嘘。
Shh.

896
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,611
没事的，鲁比。
It's okay, Ruby.

897
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:08,747
嘘。
Shh.

898
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:11,838
♬啦啦啦啦啦♬
♪ La la la la la ♪

899
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:15,625
♬啦啦啦啦啦，啦啦啦啦♬
♪ La la la la la, la la la la la ♪

900
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:19,977
♬啦啦啦啦啦，啦啦啦啦♬
♪ La la la la la, la la la la la ♪

901
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:38,952
我们好了。
We're okay.

902
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:40,824
我们好了。
We're okay.

903
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:10,462
Ruby ?
Ruby?

904
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,440
鲁比在哪里?
Where is Ruby?

905
01:15:48,456 --> 01:15:49,456
Ruby。
Ruby.

906
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:53,113
Ruby ?
Ruby?

907
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:54,287
鲁比在哪里?
Where is Ruby?

908
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,986
她是好的。
She's okay.

909
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,423
她是好的。
She's okay.

910
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,992
你现在就好，好吗?
You just get well now, okay?

911
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:14,918
我以为……-我知道。-我以为她…我以为你，你不是…我也不知道了。嘘。
I thought... - I know. - I thought she was... I thought that you were, you were n-not... I don't know anymore. Shh.

912
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:16,615
你好好休息，好吗?
You just rest up, okay?

913
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:51,824
幻觉，精神病发作?
The visions, psychotic episodes?

914
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:52,998
一去不复返了。
Gone.

915
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:05,795
幻听?
Auditory hallucinations?

916
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:06,665
你脑袋里的哭声?
The crying in your head?

917
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,232
不。
No.

918
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:16,849
偏执?阴谋论?
Paranoia? Conspiracy theories?

919
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,305
我想我们要去公园。
I think we're gonna go to the park.

920
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:19,591
我们可以一起去公园。
We can all go to the park.

921
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:21,898
怪物吗?
Monsters?

922
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:28,425
只有我。
Only me.

923
01:17:30,733 --> 01:17:32,909
这一切似乎都是那么真实。
It all seemed so real.

924
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:35,084
它是真实的。
It is real.

925
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:37,217
产后是真实的。
Postpartum is real.

926
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,177
这不是你的错。
And it's not your fault.

927
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:45,051
如果他们回来了呢?
And if they come back?

928
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,837
愿景?
The visions?

929
01:17:48,011 --> 01:17:50,143
我知道你很害怕。
I know you're afraid.

930
01:17:50,317 --> 01:17:52,668
慢慢来。
Just take it moment by moment.

931
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:58,412
你熬过了第一个晚上，然后是下一个晚上，然后就变得容易了。
You get through the first night, and then the next, and then it gets easier.

932
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:05,376
准备好了。
Ready.

933
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,465
好的。
Okay.

934
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:13,471
我来接。
I'll get this.

935
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:18,258
等着看露比吧。
Wait till you see Ruby.

936
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:21,261
她用她的小屁股在地板上滑来滑去。
She's scooting across the floor on her little bum bum.

937
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:25,831
还没说话，但她一直在喋喋不休。
And no words yet, but she's just babbling away.

938
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:31,707
最后，她能睡个安稳觉，这显然让她松了一口气。
And finally, she is sleeping through the night, which was such a relief, obviously.

939
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:36,101
谢谢。
Thanks.

940
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:37,886
为了什么?
For what?

941
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:40,236
Ruby。
Ruby.

942
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:45,721
我真不知道没有你我们该怎么办。
I, I don't know what we would've done without you.

943
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,812
没什么。
It's nothing.

944
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:01,780
我母亲去世了;我当时只是个婴儿。
My mother died; I was, I was only a baby.

945
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,435
我知道。
I know.

946
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:08,831
所以我不能叫你妈妈。
So I couldn't call you Mom.

947
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,357
但我还是做不到。
And I still can't.

948
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:17,361
没关系。
It's okay.

949
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:19,755
没关系。
It's okay.

950
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:45,475
去做吧。
Go ahead.

951
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:47,695
没关系。
It's all right.

952
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:08,194
我得去收拾行李了。
Uh, I have to go unpack.

953
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:56,286
露比应该熬过今晚。
Ruby should go through the night.

954
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,855
我明早会陪她的。
I'll spend some time with her in the morning.

955
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:04,816
她爱你。
She loves you.

956
01:21:07,688 --> 01:21:09,299
如何?
How?

957
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:10,996
在我做了这么多之后?
After all I've done?

958
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:12,997
你是她妈妈。
You're her mother.

959
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:23,400
你知道吗，当警察到达事故现场时，你几乎没有意识。
You know, when the police arrived at the scene of the accident, you were barely conscious.

960
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:27,317
汽车被压碎了。
Car was crushed.

961
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:35,499
没人知道你是怎么爬出来的，但你还是爬出了座位。
Nobody knows how, but somehow, you managed to crawl out of your seat.

962
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,025
你爬回露比身边。
You crawled back to Ruby.

963
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,115
当他们找到你的时候
And when they found you,

964
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:50,340
你在掩护她，保护她。
you were covering her, protecting her.

965
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,127
我很害怕。
I'm scared.

966
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,001
然后……
Then...

967
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:11,100
让我们熬过今晚。
Let's just get through tonight.

968
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:24,939
嘿。
Hey.

969
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,950
我来了，露比。
I'm coming, Ruby.

970
