1
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,498
Hold on a minute.

2
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,582
- What the fuck?
- Hold on a minute!

3
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,941
- Yo, what the fuck?

4
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,987
Quit playing with your fucking self!
Open the door!

5
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,349
Fuck, man.
Who the fuck is you, nigga?

6
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,909
Where are you going?

7
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,184
-Backstage. I'm in the battle.
-You can't.

8
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,023
-I got a stamp on my hand.
-Go around front.

9
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,704
-Man, you just seen me--
-I didn't see nothing.

10
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,748
You just fucking seen me.
I went to the bathroom.

11
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,139
- He has a problem with me.
- Shut up.

12
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,743
He's straight, dawg.

13
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,582
-He with you?
-Yeah.

14
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,909
Okay. Cool, Future. But your boy
got an attitude problem.

15
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,868
Come on. You're crazy,
trying to fight bouncers.

16
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:47,182
The guy's obviously got something
against me. I go to the bathroom--

17
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,341
Rise above that bullshit.

18
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,746
Hold on, man.

19
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,789
You fucking threw up on yourself?
Come here!

20
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:58,624
- Hey, Rabbit.
- I know you're ready, Rabbit.

21
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,379
- Where you goin'?
- He hurled on his shirt.

22
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,300
- Let me see.
- Get the fuck off me.

23
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,749
What are you doing, man?

24
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:09,982
Come on, it's deal time.

25
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,188
Our clica will be on the map
after you whup some ass tonight.

26
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,265
Me and Janeane broke up.

27
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,899
- What, again?
- I left her the car.

28
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,344
Come on, Rabbit.

29
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,031
She said she's pregnant.

30
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:26,587
She's gonna need the car
if she's pregnant.

31
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,390
I'll need a place to crash.

32
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,310
You going to stay at your mum's?

33
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,907
Can I get some fucking privacy here?

34
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,744
All right, come on.

35
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,107
My bad, man.

36
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:47,025
If something's gonna happen with
this shit, it needs to happen now.

37
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,183
I feel you. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

38
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:53,268
All right, come on, man.
How you feeling?

39
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,104
- I feel good.
- You feel good?

40
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:56,949
- Sure?
- I'm ready.

41
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:01,183
Ready, baby. I want to see you
rip that shit, all right?

42
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:06,063
Let these motherfuckers know, man.
It's all you, baby. Three One Third.

43
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:08,829
Your lyrics are shitty
like when I cop a squat

44
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:11,347
Who told you to fuck
with the mighty Papa Doc?

45
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:13,822
For stepping onstage
I should rock your knot

46
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,222
Don't get too close
or you might get shot

47
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:18,702
You need to call your momma
and tell her come get ya

48
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:21,431
If she knew him, she could bring
your midget pops with her

49
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,868
I put a hole in your head
Like a 12 gauge

50
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:26,592
Lookin' like Kris Kross
Jiggity jump yo' ass offstage

51
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,909
I'm a grown man, son
I'll slaughter you

52
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:31,507
Make your ma wish
her fat-ass aborted you

53
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:37,633
A lot of hostility at the end
of the 45 seconds. Let me get the mike.

54
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,705
Open up a little bit.
Let everybody see Future.

55
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:42,784
How y'all feel about Shorty Mike?

56
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,467
Kinda mediocre love?

57
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,625
Just all right for Shorty Mike?

58
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,466
All right, what about Papa Doc?

59
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:55,550
All right, Papa,
you go to the next round.

60
00:05:57,234 --> 00:06:00,783
Next up is my man Bunny Rabbit...

61
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:01,869
and Lil' Tic.

62
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:06,709
Come on, bring your asses onstage.
We ain't got all day.

63
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,310
All right, enough of the fanfare.

64
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,386
-Heads or tails?
-Heads.

65
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,906
Tails. Choose.

66
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:20,910
You first.

67
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,989
Lil' Tic, set it off.
DJ, 45 seconds.

68
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,270
Spin that shit.

69
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:28,634
I'ma murder this man!

70
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,631
He's the type to lose
a fight with a dyke

71
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,593
They don't laugh 'cause you wack
It's 'cause you white with a mic

72
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:38,150
You're a laughingstock
When will this laughter stop?

73
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,624
When you and Everlast
bitch-ass get popped

74
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:43,225
You a wigga
that invented rhyme for money

75
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:46,148
Watch Lil' Tic spit kick
the Energizer Bunny

76
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,669
Rip the Rabbit head off
Toss it to Hugh Hefner

77
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:51,269
'Cause I don't play, boy
Tell me who's fresher

78
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:54,109
LT, that's right
Cock the heat and shoot ya

79
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,790
I'll punish Rabbit
or obsolete Future

80
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:59,153
My paws love to maul an MC

81
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,836
'Cause he's faker than a psychic
with caller ID

82
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,632
So that bullshit,
save it for storage

83
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,434
'Cause this is hip-hop
You don't belong, you're a tourist

84
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,064
Put your hockey sticks
and baseball bat away

85
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:14,115
This here's Detroit
16 Mile Road is thataway

86
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,071
Whoa, whoa, okay,
45 seconds, very nice.

87
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,712
You did a good job, Lil' Bitch.
I mean, Lil' Tic. My bad.

88
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,071
All right, next up
is my boy Bunny Rabbit.

89
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:28,831
Hey, talk that shit if you want,
but I vouch for this motherfucker.

90
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,986
He's a motherfuckin' genius.

91
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,547
Hit that shit. Forty-five seconds.
DJ, kick it.

92
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,112
Hey, yo.

93
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,225
Boo!

94
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:52,668
Where'd y'all find this nigga at?

95
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:56,670
Come on, Rabbit!

96
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:01,225
Come on, Rabbit! Come on!

97
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,749
Choke! Choke!

98
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,554
Yo, Jimmy.

99
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,633
Hold up.

100
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:50,229
Don't worry about it, dawg.
I'll call you tomorrow.

101
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,879
I got to go back inside.

102
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,679
Stay strong, my brother.

103
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,672
You'll rip 'em next time.

104
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,872
-Yep.
-Yeah. Next time.

105
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,755
Peace out, Rabbit!

106
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,310
What the fuck?

107
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,119
- Oh, shit, Rabbit.
- Oh, God.

108
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:31,391
You okay, baby?

109
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:38,517
Don't you think
you should have called or...

110
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,759
knocked first or something?

111
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,516
Phone's disconnected.

112
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:45,556
I know that, Rabbit.

113
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,834
I gotta get down
to the phone place tomorrow.

114
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:52,922
I've been busy, you know.

115
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,514
Rabbit, what are you doing here?

116
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,118
How about knocking?

117
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:04,561
Me and Janeane just broke up.

118
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,122
I'm sorry, honey.

119
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:09,432
I thought you had
a good thing going with her.

120
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:11,798
- Sleeping with someone else?
- No.

121
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,755
I got work in the morning, so....

122
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:19,518
You and Future still
at that Little Caesars in Warren?

123
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,831
No. I'm at New Detroit Stamping now.

124
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:25,921
That's good. What?

125
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,195
He got fired from a pizza place.

126
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:32,162
-At least I got a fucking job.
-Okay, stop it.

127
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:36,124
Only ex-cons and welfare mums work
at that plant.

128
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:38,793
Baby...

129
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:41,239
are you staying here for a while
or what?

130
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:47,363
Just for a couple weeks, till I can
save enough to get my own place.

131
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,483
Just like Bob Zurowsky.

132
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,557
All your friends still living
at home, aren't they?

133
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:56,195
What a bunch of fucking losers.

134
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:58,639
- Fuck you!
- What's your problem?

135
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,522
What's your problem, bitch?
Don't kick my clothes!

136
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:04,437
-Don't fucking judge me!
-Why don't you grow up!

137
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,276
- Stop it!
- It's him, not me!

138
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,083
I've fought guys bigger than you.

139
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:10,076
- Fucking punk.
-Stop it!

140
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,680
Hey, Lily.

141
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,804
Hey, baby.
What are you still doing up?

142
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,718
You woke me up.

143
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,438
Yeah, I'm sorry, baby.

144
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:23,634
What'd I do?

145
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,875
- Go back to bed.
- Will you sing to me?

146
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,838
Yeah. Of course I will. Come on.

147
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:32,322
I know this girl

148
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,603
Her name is Lily

149
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,002
And it's past her bed

150
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,881
T-l-M-E

151
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,803
She goes to sleep

152
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,682
And she can just dream

153
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,117
And not have to be

154
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:52,365
In a stinky trailer with me

155
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,083
So when I feel blue

156
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,837
Don't know what to do

157
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,764
I look at you

158
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,354
And I just say

159
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:10,564
Good night, baby. Go to sleep.

160
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:19,235
If you're going to live here,
you have to get along with Greg.

161
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,121
He started it.

162
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,802
You can't fuck this up
for me, baby.

163
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,437
-You just can't.
-Whatever.

164
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,316
No milk.

165
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,357
Can I get a ride to work
in the morning?

166
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:42,442
Where's your car?

167
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,206
I left it for Janeane.

168
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:55,838
You're going to let me
borrow your car?

169
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:57,762
Nope.

170
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,726
It's your birthday present.

171
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,120
My birthday's not for two weeks.

172
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:04,683
I know.

173
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:10,244
But you're still
my little Rabbit, right?

174
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:12,842
I need to get to sleep.

175
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,560
Bunny! What up, doe?

176
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,842
Heard about you and Janeane.

177
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:44,122
-I thought you might be back home.
-This ain't my home.

178
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,084
Why you up so early?

179
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,767
Up, man? I ain't even been to bed.
I came to talk to you--

180
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,530
I don't got time to talk right now.
I'm late for work.

181
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,085
-Can you give me a ride?
-My ma's got the car.

182
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,925
Don't tell nobody
I'm living back here, man.

183
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,242
What happened last night?
I heard you got caught out.

184
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,366
People are saying fucked up shit.

185
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,848
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

186
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,161
Why are you still going to
The Shelter?

187
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,925
There's nobody there but clowns
who ain't got deals and never will.

188
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,843
You need to stay at home.
You know Wink's got you.

189
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,047
-Whatever, man.
-I'm telling you, I'm on my way.

190
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,924
I'm taking you with me.
You're the franchise, baby.

191
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,807
-The franchise?
-Yeah.

192
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,319
I'm taking a fucking bus to work.

193
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:29,967
Look, I was just on the horn
with my man Roy Darucher.

194
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,884
-The promo guy?
-Yeah.

195
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:34,007
Roy's all hooked up at 98.

196
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:36,569
So what's he need you for?

197
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:40,439
What's he need me for? Talent, dawg.
You know that's my specialty.

198
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,282
I'm the one
that tipped him on Big O...

199
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:45,169
and got that fat man out of
flipping burgers at Mickey D's.

200
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:48,204
Roy liked what he heard,
paid for the nigga's demo...

201
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,204
and boom, just like that,
Big O got a deal, all because of me.

202
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,724
- Roy paid for Big O's demo?
- Every penny.

203
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,320
If they thought Big O was hot,
wait till they hear B-Rabbit.

204
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,810
I'm building an empire
and I'm taking you with me.

205
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:03,879
You're next.

206
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,325
- All right.
- All right.

207
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:06,731
I'll talk to you later.

208
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:08,325
- Call me later.
- Okay.

209
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,443
Up!

210
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:34,370
Down!

211
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:51,684
Up!

212
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:53,249
Down!

213
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,205
-What up, Manny?
-You was late today, Smith.

214
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:18,169
Yeah, it wasn't my fault.
My car wouldn't start--

215
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,855
It ain't never your fault.
I don't want to hear it.

216
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:25,693
I guess this isn't the best timing,
but I need some extra shifts.

217
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,248
Are you shittin' me?

218
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:29,724
You just started working here.
Hey, Dutton.

219
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:32,848
- He shittin' me?
- What?

220
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,527
You late again and you're fired.

221
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:39,848
-I'm looking for John Latourno.
-I can take you.

222
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:42,284
I don't think so, Smith.
Right this way.

223
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:43,845
Thank you.

224
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:10,925
Big wheels keep on turnin'

225
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,246
-Who the fuck is that?
-Greg Buehl.

226
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:17,415
That dude is practically
living with my fucking mum.

227
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:19,845
They met at bingo.

228
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:21,885
Wait.

229
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:23,966
Greg Buehl?

230
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:25,935
He went to our school, right?

231
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:31,530
I got to save up some money
and get the hell out of here.

232
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:33,410
This shit is ridiculous.

233
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:39,170
Well, Jimmy moved in
with his mother

234
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,612
'Cause he ain't got no place to go

235
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:48,656
Now I'm right back in the gutter

236
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:53,291
With a garbage bag
that's full of clothes

237
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:54,613
Bust it.

238
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,410
You live at home in a trailer

239
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:02,449
What the hell you gonna do?

240
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:07,378
'Cause I live at home in a trailer

241
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:12,047
Mom, I'm coming home to you

242
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:13,328
Break it down.

243
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:16,053
My name is Jimmy,
his name's Greg Buehl

244
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,727
Me, him and you
we went to the same school

245
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,810
This ain't cool
I'm in a rage

246
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:23,254
He's tappin' my mom
We're almost the same age

247
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,611
On the microphone,
I drop bombs

248
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,168
Look at this car!
Thanks a lot, Mom

249
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,610
''Here, happy birthday, Rabbit

250
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:32,849
''Here's a brand new car,
you can have it!''

251
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,136
A 1928 Delta

252
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,729
This shit won't even get me
to The Shelter

253
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,055
And I can't even say I'm from Motown

254
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,335
'Cause I'm back in the 810 now

255
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,378
'Cause I live at home in a trailer

256
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,531
Mom, I'm coming home to you

257
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,896
You know
there's another battle next week?

258
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,574
I don't want to hear shit about it.
I'm signing you up.

259
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,379
-Man, don't.
-Come on, man. You got to battle!

260
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,859
Future, I'm not you, dawg.

261
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,133
- Look at me.
- Listen.

262
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,053
Once they hear you,
it won't matter what colour you are.

263
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,293
You win some battles...

264
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,940
Three One Third will have
the street credit we need.

265
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,692
With you and me as the anchors.

266
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,455
Did you hear that Wink
has been talking to that promo guy?

267
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,851
Yeah, I heard that bullshit.
Wink is scandalous, dawg.

268
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,055
Could be a shot.

269
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,417
You know I'm trying to get straight
with the Lord...

270
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:26,971
so I don't like bringing too much
negative into my positive world...

271
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:30,371
but Wink is just talking shit.
There'll be no action, just talk.

272
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:34,654
Sweet home Alabama

273
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:38,696
Got a cigarette?

274
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,495
-The dude mentally ill?
-Car accident, man.

275
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:53,413
He's supposed to get some big
settlement cheque soon or some shit.

276
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,059
Will you hurry up with that thing?

277
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,536
Try it now.

278
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:03,897
Give it some gas.

279
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,450
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
We're going out tonight.

280
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:17,854
- Tonight?
- Yeah....

281
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,851
Fuck last night. Okay? Forget it.

282
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,573
What about being straight
with the Lord?

283
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:30,297
Come on man, it's Saturday. I can
get straight with him on Sunday.

284
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:35,891
Hey, B, I got these new beats, man.

285
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:40,251
You know how much I like your mum--

286
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:43,380
Shit, I really, really like
your momma, Rabbit.

287
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:46,341
But she did you no favour
when she left you this car.

288
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:48,135
Fuck you. Get out and walk.

289
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:50,254
Hey, man, at least the radio plays.

290
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:53,976
What's up with this whole
East CoastlWest Coast thing?

291
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:57,738
- We got to put Mo on the map.
- Yeah. Talking about the1.

292
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:01,699
Man, nobody even knows
Detroit is the1.

293
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:03,296
1!

294
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,619
You're from 810, fathead.

295
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:09,542
We gotta make our own sound.
Fuck everybody else.

296
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:13,616
Yeah, then we get a deal,
go platinum, get cheesed out...

297
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:16,338
and get all the bitches!

298
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:17,742
All the hoes.

299
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:21,222
Do you think I have a big head?

300
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:32,660
Why'd you bring
that damn thing, man?

301
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:34,579
Oh, man!

302
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:36,939
Shoot it.

303
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,413
Pinkeye, bitch!

304
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,417
Let me see.

305
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:45,183
Let me show you motherfuckers
how to shoot something.

306
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:46,583
Do it, do it.

307
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:51,737
Okay. Here we go.
Here it is, here it is.

308
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:57,212
Take the wheel, man.

309
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:59,457
-The gas, too.
-I got the gas.

310
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:03,015
Hey, Rabbit,
get back in the car, man.

311
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:06,182
Hit the bus! Hit the bus!

312
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,457
Man, give me my fucking gun.

313
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:17,657
What the fuck is wrong with you?

314
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,174
Oh, shit.

315
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:24,414
Fuck!

316
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:27,373
-Toss the weed, Cheddar!
-Toss the fucking weed!

317
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,138
-What the fuck are you doing?
-The fucking car just died.

318
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,863
Oh, come on, man.

319
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:37,825
I told you stupid-ass niggas
not to be doing this shit.

320
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:56,335
That rifle ain't mine.
I don't want to go to jail.

321
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:57,541
Shut the fuck up!

322
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,499
I'm fucking serious.
I get claustrophobic.

323
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:12,142
- You were scared!
- You were scared!

324
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,296
No, you were scared, motherfucker!

325
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:18,419
Do you know how many abandoned
buildings we have in Detroit?

326
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:20,857
How can you have pride
in your neighbourhood...

327
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,619
with shit like that next door?

328
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:24,265
Does the city tear them down?

329
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:27,544
They're too busy building casinos
and taking money from people.

330
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:30,779
Shut your preaching ass up.
Nobody care about that shit.

331
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,938
Did you care
when the crackhead raped that girl?

332
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:35,667
You think it would've happened
without an abandoned house?

333
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:37,579
- They caught him, right?
- Yeah.

334
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:40,104
Dumb motherfucker
went back to the house.

335
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,826
How stupid could a nigga be.

336
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:46,097
- What's happening under that hood?
- It's a just a short. Chill out.

337
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:49,419
I ain't getting back in that
piece of shit. It's a death-trap.

338
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,464
I think Jimmy's mum's
trying to kill him.

339
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,540
Yeah, she's so goddamn fine,
she could kill me.

340
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:58,059
Don't be saying shit
about my mum or my fucking car, man.

341
00:25:58,469 --> 00:25:59,618
I hear everything.

342
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:02,778
He a ninja now.

343
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,143
- B-Rabbit!
- Okay, it's about time.

344
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:09,659
Money under the hood
Money on the mic

345
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,622
Freaky girls, here we come

346
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:12,983
Yo, let me get a light, DJ.

347
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,704
Oh, shit.
What the fuck's going on out here?

348
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,826
-What's up, man? You all right?
-I'm cool.

349
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,468
-You sure?
-Yeah.

350
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,144
You the man, Rabbit.

351
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,260
My voice spits the fiery reign

352
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,339
Try and refrain

353
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,388
Come on, baby, it's redemption time.
Come on, man.

354
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,700
I be the nigga in The Shelter
Eyein' your chain

355
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,179
313 area
Bomb and bury you with vengeance

356
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,546
My rhyme sentences will end
your resistance with a rigorousness

357
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,099
Niggas, I'm serious, delirious
'Cause a curious

358
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:17,465
Pause the fury 'cause

359
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:19,906
Throw my jaws
from devouring y'all raw

360
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:24,146
Three One Third, we in the house.
Mac Mitten's finest.

361
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,904
DJ Iz, let me get that beat, baby.
Give me that beat.

362
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,141
Hip-Hop Shop, baby. Come on.

363
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:33,943
You forced to listen to
the individual, the metaphysical

364
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:36,750
The Mac Mitten rhyme ritual
Heterosexual

365
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:39,425
Syllables sound complex to you
Lines perplexing you

366
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:42,309
With words that put a hex on you
Snap that neck on you

367
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:44,985
Murder you, boil you
We keep a white boy or two

368
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:48,103
Let my man grab the mic
See how Bunny Rabbit do

369
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:49,380
Come on, man.

370
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:52,386
Come on, man.
Kick that shit, baby. Come on.

371
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:54,827
Come on.

372
00:27:56,952 --> 00:27:58,670
Watch that nigga kick this shit.

373
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:01,950
Speed it up a little bit, Iz.

374
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:04,181
Come on, baby.

375
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:08,626
All right, look. Yo. Yo.

376
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:13,472
Your style's generic
Mine's authentic made

377
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:16,186
I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid

378
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:18,952
My technique's bizarre and ill
I scar and kill

379
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,592
You were a star until
I served you like a bar and grill

380
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:24,630
As I cook and grill ya
That's all it took to kill ya

381
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:27,272
You better recognize me
like I look familiar

382
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,024
Want to battle?
You beat around the bush

383
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:32,070
Like you're scared to lick pussy
so you eat around the tush

384
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:35,031
I need a clown to push
Someone I can bully

385
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,547
Wait, I don't think
you understand fully

386
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,988
Me without style
Is like mustard without Heinz

387
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:42,633
I lead the new school
You're a Busta without the Rhymes

388
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:44,192
I'll crush the shit out your lines

389
00:28:44,353 --> 00:28:46,708
I'm the Da Sheki
Smokin' da leaky leaky

390
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,307
Ten freaky girls
inside the Chin Tiki

391
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,782
Girl, when you see me,
You better believe me

392
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:54,307
This ain't a game
And pimpin' ain't easy

393
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:56,827
Anything goes when it comes to hoes

394
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,342
I'm the kingpin
when it comes to flows

395
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,901
You better ask someone
if you don't know

396
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:04,427
When you see me, girl
say ''What up, Doe?''

397
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,032
Ten freaky girls

398
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,671
Ten, ten, ten freaky girls

399
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:13,506
Shit. Look, man.

400
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:19,103
Listen up now.

401
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:21,469
Leadaz Of Tha Free World
in the motherfuckin' house.

402
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,392
Me and Papa Doc
will battle any motherfuckers here.

403
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,823
-Yeah.
-Told you they were talkin' shit.

404
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:28,912
- Fuck Tha Free World.
-Yeah.

405
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,908
Fuck Tha Free World!

406
00:29:31,954 --> 00:29:33,182
Fuck Tha Free World?

407
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:36,264
You Three One Third bitches is wack.

408
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:37,983
Yo, fat-ass!

409
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:39,553
Talking about your man Sol

410
00:29:39,754 --> 00:29:42,632
I kick you in the chest
Pork chops fall out your asshole

411
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,310
You cats is pussy
Soft like wet flowers

412
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:48,028
Leadaz Of Tha Free World
Here to smash you cowards

413
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:50,231
-Look at Future--
-Don't start, nigga.

414
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,111
What are you going to do, faggot?

415
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:55,113
-Who you calling a faggot?
-Don't play yourself, bitch.

416
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:58,269
Hold on. Yo, Elvis.
You don't want to step to this.

417
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:01,587
You need to take that white ass rap
back across 8 Mile.

418
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:04,470
Caught your choke act
at The Shelter last night.

419
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:09,950
Oh, shit!

420
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,754
What are you doing?
Put the shit down.

421
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:21,270
- Come on.
- Pull out!

422
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:24,391
Be cool. Chill, chill. Come on.

423
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:27,114
Yo, Iz, it's cool. It's cool.

424
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:28,674
Yo, come on, man. Let's go.

425
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:31,784
Come on.
I should fuck you up, Cheddar.

426
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:39,795
What the fuck were you thinking?
''Fuck Tha Free World''?

427
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:40,791
Future said it!

428
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:46,588
It's at the Hip-Hop Shop.
Leadaz Of Tha Free World.

429
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,910
Hip-Hop Shop, Wednesday night.
Come on down.

430
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,796
It'll be your only opportunity
to blow both of us.

431
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:01,704
After we go platinum, you won't
be able to get to me and Future.

432
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:05,554
Why do they call you Future?

433
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,514
I had a lot of names,
the most conceited kind.

434
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:13,707
I was Maximum, Brimstone,
Godfather D, Devastatin' D.

435
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,431
Big D, that has a double meaning.

436
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:18,989
But none of them worked...

437
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,627
till I started hosting the battles
at The Shelter.

438
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,428
One day somebody said,
''You know what?

439
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,516
''You are the future
of hip-hop in Detroit.''

440
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,511
So you see, baby...

441
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:33,108
sometimes you got to find your name
and other times...

442
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,030
your name finds you.

443
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,196
Want to smoke some ganja?

444
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,186
That's our problem. If we don't
respect our sisters, who will?

445
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:44,670
We're doing it to ourselves.

446
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:47,953
He's my brother.
He don't like pussy.

447
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:53,794
Rabbit, teach me to write rhymes.
That's how to get the ladies, right?

448
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,308
Let me out.

449
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,830
Hold on. Yo, I'm sorry, dawg.

450
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,911
I didn't know Papa and LC were
on their bullshit until tonight.

451
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,032
I wouldn't be with them...

452
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,587
except I'm promoting a show
with them at Hip-Hop Shop.

453
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,112
Those Free World bitches?

454
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:17,277
See what I'm talking about?

455
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,869
Look, they're just one of the acts.

456
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,192
If you want, I'll step out.

457
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,275
You're my friend.
I don't want you mad.

458
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,917
Man, do what you want to do.

459
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,671
Yeah, do what you want to do.

460
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,752
Respect yourself, sister.

461
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,632
Goddamn. Don't you ever shut up?

462
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,038
Why you got to push me?

463
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,235
Damn, Future.

464
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,791
What the hell is his problem?

465
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,075
- Future?
- Yeah.

466
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,757
He thinks sometimes you talk shit.

467
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,997
Who's he to say what's real?
'Cause he hosts the battles?

468
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,113
Ain't that Janeane?

469
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,678
- I thought she was pregnant.

470
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,235
- Pregnant?

471
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,480
I'm out. I'll be outside.

472
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:12,070
By myself.

473
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,510
Here's your chance, girl. Go ahead.

474
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:41,474
You're Jimmy Smith, Jr.

475
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:44,750
My name's Alex.

476
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,552
You find the guy
you was looking for?

477
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,753
-What guy?
-At the plant.

478
00:33:51,402 --> 00:33:53,962
That was my brother.
I was borrowing a car.

479
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,393
I hear you're a real dope rapper.

480
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:01,393
-A ''dope'' rapper?
-Yeah.

481
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:03,195
Who told you that?

482
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:04,715
You know, it's around.

483
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:08,479
If you're so dope,
why are you at Dead End Stamping?

484
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,600
- Your brother works there.
- My brother's a loser.

485
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:13,917
And you?

486
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:17,232
I work at Intermezzo,
saving enough to get out of here.

487
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,915
Bussin' dishes is much better
than pressing bumpers.

488
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:21,832
I won't be there long.

489
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:23,799
-Where are you going?
-New York.

490
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:26,471
I won a modelling contest.

491
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:29,952
A judge said he'd help me out.
I just have to get a book together.

492
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:31,955
What if he ain't for real?

493
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,080
All I'm looking for is a ticket.

494
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:39,200
Rabbit! You and your friend want
to bounce to an after-hours spot?

495
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:41,797
''Rabbit.''

496
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,082
Let me ask my friends.

497
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:55,556
Where are we going?

498
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:56,951
My house.

499
00:34:57,682 --> 00:34:59,912
-What about your mum?
-Working nights.

500
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:02,441
That's the after-hours spot?

501
00:35:02,723 --> 00:35:03,599
Heck, yeah.

502
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:07,401
Can some of us ride with you?

503
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:15,961
-Why do they call you Rabbit?
-He's fast and likes to fuck a lot.

504
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,276
Get your hand off my balls!

505
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:22,236
Why are you being so ignorant?

506
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:23,559
Jimmy!

507
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,716
-What's wrong with you?
-My bad, you guys.

508
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,113
Are you signed?

509
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:35,042
Not yet, but I'm working on
something for him.

510
00:35:36,243 --> 00:35:37,881
He'll record a demo at MCA.

511
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:41,118
-Really?
-Yeah, but I was--

512
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:45,077
If you want to see Jimmy flow,
come to the battle at The Shelter.

513
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:46,879
He's the best!

514
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:48,714
Shut up.

515
00:35:48,804 --> 00:35:50,556
-When is it?
-Friday night.

516
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:51,639
Yeah?

517
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:53,320
Can I come?

518
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm not battling next Friday, dawg.

519
00:35:56,685 --> 00:35:58,835
You will if she's there.

520
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,123
You want to be the man.

521
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:03,516
All right. Just don't push.

522
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:05,641
We all need to be pushed sometimes.

523
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:09,078
My bad. I'm sorry.

524
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,123
You gonna let him push you?

525
00:36:12,324 --> 00:36:13,677
You can't catch me
and you never will!

526
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,203
Out of my way, freaky girl!

527
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:19,199
Wipe your feet. Hey, wipe your feet!

528
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:29,201
You like?

529
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,522
She's getting out of the D, though.

530
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:34,994
Negro, please.
That's what they all say.

531
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:38,201
No, I think she's different.

532
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,842
That chick
really blew both you guys?

533
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:45,598
I'm a sinner, James.

534
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,677
Come to church with me
in the morning.

535
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:57,516
I saw you talking to Papa Doc
in the Chin Tiki.

536
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,554
-How do you know him?
-You mean Clarence?

537
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:04,560
He went to Cranbrook
with Christine's brother.

538
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,957
- You want to dance?
- Not right now.

539
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,601
Fucking Wink.
Trying to keep us in division...

540
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,997
with that fake-ass
Big Willie wannabe talk.

541
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:20,157
-Nothing wrong with a free demo.
-Free comes with a dick up your ass.

542
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:23,285
Three One Third is real.
What Wink is talking about is wack.

543
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:26,325
Another example of people's needs
being denied by the city.

544
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,443
The media should be all over this.

545
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:31,564
It'll happen again.
The city don't give a fuck.

546
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,880
What is he talking about?

547
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,606
The abandoned house
where the girl got raped.

548
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,923
It's called
an ''attractive nuisance.''

549
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:43,245
It wouldn't still be standing if
it were on the other side of 8 Mile.

550
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,441
It could have been Lily.

551
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:57,516
Burn this shit down to the ground.

552
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:59,127
That's what I mean.

553
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,761
Fuck, yeah, man!

554
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:04,279
Burn this fucking thing down!

555
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:07,964
This is the definition
of an attractive nuisance.

556
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,400
- Come on, let's burn this bitch.
- Right behind you.

557
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:14,487
That's what I mean.

558
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:16,647
I thought I had matches.

559
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,002
You got my lighter?

560
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,000
- I gave it back.
- I got one.

561
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,125
Wait, what are you doing?

562
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:23,397
No!

563
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,007
What the fuck, you guys!

564
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,042
I'm gonna fuck you up, Cheddar!

565
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,326
Burn!

566
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:11,598
Hey! I burned the house down!

567
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,130
- The roof, the roof

568
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,486
The roof is on fire

569
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,199
We don't need no water
let the motherfucker burn

570
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,851
Burn, motherfucker, burn!

571
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,764
It's almost beautiful.

572
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:36,962
When I was little, I wanted to live
in a house like this.

573
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,409
You know, how it used to be.

574
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:41,884
You live with your family?

575
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,766
I got out of there
as quick as I could.

576
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,044
I left home when I was 17.

577
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:49,967
What about you?

578
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:53,530
Sort of the same.

579
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,249
When you record your demo...

580
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,090
I'd really love to be there.

581
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,680
Hey, girl! Is it hot enough for you?

582
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:18,244
You're going to be great.

583
00:40:19,932 --> 00:40:21,684
I got a feeling about you.

584
00:40:22,492 --> 00:40:23,481
Let's go, Alex.

585
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,485
I'll see you.

586
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:28,162
See you.

587
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:33,608
Cheddar, bring your ass on!
Come on!

588
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:44,684
Pesky mosquito!

589
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:45,887
Let's see.

590
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:49,130
Oh, yeah. ''And the mirror said,
'Not you, Queenie.'''

591
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:50,367
Shit!

592
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:51,807
What's wrong?

593
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:55,771
We're being evicted. God damn it!

594
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,800
Come on, Mum. Not in front of Lily.

595
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:03,124
I can't let Greg find out.

596
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:06,969
Fuck Greg.

597
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:12,921
I'm three months late.

598
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:18,088
- We've got 30 days to get the money.
- ''We''?

599
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:21,166
If you want to live here,
you got to start chipping in.

600
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:24,211
Where's Greg's settlement cheque?
Get the money from him.

601
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:25,443
I can't.

602
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:29,651
He's going to ask me and Lily
to move away with him.

603
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:32,282
Some place nice real soon.
I can't freak him out--

604
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,329
Mum, stop living
your life like this!

605
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:38,646
If you cared about Lily, you'd get
a job and quit fucking around.

606
00:41:39,974 --> 00:41:42,204
I got to go. I'll be late for work.

607
00:41:47,095 --> 00:41:50,053
What are you doing with your life
that's so great, Rabbit?

608
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:02,167
Wink's working on a deal...

609
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:04,446
where I can get free studio time...

610
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:06,248
to record my demo.

611
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:09,364
Yeah.

612
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,649
Right.

613
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,569
'Bye, baby.

614
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,853
Alex Latourno
Hotter than an inferno

615
00:42:19,254 --> 00:42:20,687
Hotter than a crack house

616
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,044
Burn internal

617
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:41,571
Up!

618
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:42,850
Down!

619
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:48,488
Why does Manny give me
so much shit all the time?

620
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:52,046
Maybe because
you give him reason to.

621
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:54,210
Stick to the plan, man.

622
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:58,646
Just do your work
and shut the fuck up.

623
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:02,413
Up!

624
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:05,166
Down!

625
00:43:15,538 --> 00:43:16,936
Why haven't you called?

626
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:20,452
Janeane, I can't talk here.
You'll get me fired.

627
00:43:20,577 --> 00:43:21,851
I'm your girlfriend.

628
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:26,014
No, you're not. We broke up.
I'll call you later.

629
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,094
You just left without saying a word.

630
00:43:28,378 --> 00:43:29,492
I left you the car.

631
00:43:30,137 --> 00:43:31,969
Was it 'cause I said I was pregnant?

632
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:34,815
I know why you said that bullshit.

633
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:37,487
-You have to go.
-I didn't know what else to do.

634
00:43:37,577 --> 00:43:39,967
Tell me why you left
and I'll leave you alone.

635
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:43,687
It's not you, okay? It's me.
It's my shit. I had to go.

636
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:44,814
Why?

637
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:46,855
-What are you running from?
-Nothing!

638
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:48,212
Would you just go!

639
00:43:53,738 --> 00:43:56,252
Everyone's calling you a loser
from the other night.

640
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:58,727
-Who is?
-Everybody's talking about it.

641
00:43:59,379 --> 00:44:01,290
How you froze up
and got booed offstage.

642
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:02,698
Fuck you! Go home.

643
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,093
What was that all about?

644
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:12,098
Sorry, Manny. It wasn't my....

645
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:14,767
It won't happen again.

646
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,372
Good. Don't be bringing that shit
around here.

647
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,618
Now get back to work.

648
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:26,689
Rakim was the first rapper
with complex lyrics.

649
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:30,254
But as far as beats and lyrics go,
Biggie is the bomb.

650
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:34,696
I can't believe y'all talk about
complex shit and leave out 2Pac.

651
00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:35,814
Fuck 2Pac!

652
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:38,857
Nigga, you crazy? Pac's the only
lyrical motherfucker out there!

653
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,578
He's right. His shit has emotion.

654
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,651
-What about the Beasties?
-Fuck them.

655
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,731
How can you even bring them
in the mix?

656
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:46,776
They bust some serious shit.

657
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,897
Those white boys are
more like busters on serious shit.

658
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,459
I won't bump no Beasties.

659
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,451
But it's always easier
for whites to succeed...

660
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,370
in a black man's medium. Right, B?

661
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:58,613
Word up. It's true.

662
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,297
- What are you doing, man?
- Rabbit!

663
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:08,660
Oh, shit.

664
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:11,692
Don't worry, Rabbit.
I got your back!

665
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:18,573
Hey, what's up, B?

666
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,374
You want to fuck with us?

667
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,569
Get off me.

668
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,011
What the fuck you gonna do?

669
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:39,290
Come on, man!

670
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,011
Let him go.

671
00:45:51,222 --> 00:45:52,860
You want to fuck with us?

672
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,217
Fuck with us, yeah?

673
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:57,338
What the fuck are you doing?
Where'd you get that shit?

674
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,536
It's my mum's.

675
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:02,819
Put it away
before you fucking kill somebody!

676
00:46:03,382 --> 00:46:04,610
Papa Doc had one!

677
00:46:04,702 --> 00:46:05,771
Put it away!

678
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:08,856
Man, put it down.

679
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:10,011
Come on.

680
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:13,817
Okay.

681
00:46:14,982 --> 00:46:16,255
- Fuck, man.
- Shit!

682
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:17,860
What the fuck?

683
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:19,818
Oh, shit!

684
00:46:20,223 --> 00:46:21,576
Let's get out of here.

685
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:23,371
- Shit!

686
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,454
We got to get him to a hospital.

687
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:27,976
- Where are the keys?
- Get the car!

688
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:32,621
I got to put pressure on it.
Try not to think about it.

689
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,170
My God.
He shot his fucking dick off.

690
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:37,538
-Did I?
-Man, shut the fuck up!

691
00:46:38,302 --> 00:46:40,657
-Take Gratiot to McDougal.
-I live here, too.

692
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:42,574
- I know how to get there!
- Do it!

693
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:44,654
Rabbit's going to teach me
to write rhymes.

694
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:46,619
What were you doing with a gun?

695
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:49,092
What were you doing
with those fuckers?

696
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,059
I have a show with them!

697
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:53,179
Calm the fuck down, y'all!

698
00:46:53,302 --> 00:46:54,291
MC Bob.

699
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:56,735
- What?
- MC Bob.

700
00:46:57,302 --> 00:46:59,454
- What do you mean?
- Is it a good name?

701
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,217
What's wrong with Cheddar Bob?

702
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:03,056
I like MC Bob. Right?

703
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:05,815
Yeah. MC Bob.

704
00:47:06,463 --> 00:47:09,023
I got that fat man
out of Mickey D's.

705
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:13,335
Roy's going to interview him
at JLB and I'll be there.

706
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:15,295
It's gonna be on!

707
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:18,501
The doctor said he hit an artery,
but he'll be okay.

708
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:20,376
That's good, man.

709
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:21,896
Where were you?

710
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:24,020
Praying. Is he all right?

711
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:26,577
Let's go, man.

712
00:47:27,103 --> 00:47:29,458
Wink told us how he got in
with Roy Darucher.

713
00:47:29,744 --> 00:47:31,223
That shit's hot, man.

714
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,256
He's doing an interview down at JLB.

715
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:41,022
Why are you listening to this clown?

716
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:42,580
What?

717
00:47:42,705 --> 00:47:44,535
You heard me. Clown.

718
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:49,620
Why you got to be like that?

719
00:47:49,905 --> 00:47:52,260
This is a good deal for him.
It's for real.

720
00:47:53,345 --> 00:47:54,539
It's for real?

721
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:57,185
Like the time you said
your cousin worked for Dr. Dre?

722
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:59,017
Or the time you were real tight...

723
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:01,897
with the intern
in Russell Simmons' office?

724
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:04,263
-Or how about--
-Shut the fuck up!

725
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:06,783
Why are you always giving me shit?

726
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:09,783
Is it because I'm making moves?

727
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:13,336
Or because your ass is stuck
hosting battles for two years.

728
00:48:13,705 --> 00:48:15,057
You're a fucking loser.

729
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:17,579
- Who are you calling--
- Yo, chill!

730
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:20,941
What the fuck? How can you
fight about this shit now?

731
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,220
I know what you're trying to do
to our group.

732
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:24,294
Suck a dick!

733
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,104
You little bitch!

734
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:27,374
Back down!

735
00:48:27,745 --> 00:48:31,182
Cheddar's in the hospital
and you fight about this?

736
00:48:31,986 --> 00:48:33,385
So fucking stupid!

737
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:46,139
Forget this car, B.

738
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:50,302
I'll give you a ride to work
in the morning.

739
00:48:51,226 --> 00:48:52,898
You've made a mistake.

740
00:48:52,987 --> 00:48:55,103
I don't have any coloured girl
in my class.

741
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:58,422
There's Sarah Jane.
There's my baby.

742
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:00,340
You mean Sarah Jane Johnson?

743
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:02,418
Yes, ma'am. I'm Mrs. Johnson.

744
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:06,623
Sarah Jane?
I brought you these....

745
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:13,346
You win at bingo tonight?

746
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,782
No.

747
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:17,706
You record your demo yet?

748
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:21,375
What happened to you?

749
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:25,217
Cheddar Bob had an accident,
but he's fine. I'm fine.

750
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:28,215
You and your friends.

751
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,141
Mum, don't start, please.

752
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:33,018
It's been a long fucking night.

753
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:34,427
Tell me about it.

754
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,101
Me and Greg are having problems.

755
00:49:38,548 --> 00:49:40,220
He found out about the eviction?

756
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:41,218
No.

757
00:49:41,988 --> 00:49:44,628
-The settlement cheque ain't coming.
-No, it's coming.

758
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:47,738
It's our sex life.

759
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:50,260
I don't want to hear this shit.

760
00:49:50,428 --> 00:49:52,499
I mean, it's good. It's real good.

761
00:49:53,588 --> 00:49:54,816
But he won't--

762
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,421
I don't want to hear this!

763
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:57,827
Greg won't go down on me.

764
00:49:58,068 --> 00:49:59,104
Mum!

765
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:17,738
Hey, Sol.

766
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,144
Ever wonder at what point
you got to say, ''Fuck it''?

767
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:27,269
When you got to stop living up here
and start living down here?

768
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,066
It's 7:00 in the morning, dawg.

769
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,419
-Thank your mum for the car.
-All right.

770
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:58,024
I'm getting so sick and tired
of fucking with this steel

771
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:00,870
They only give us 30 minutes
to eat lunch and chill

772
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:04,061
My body aching
just to get a buck

773
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:06,789
I'm sick of eating shit
off this fucking lunch truck

774
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:10,311
Nasty-ass food
I'm in a nasty-ass mood

775
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,985
Should have called in sick
Shit, I had somethin' to do!

776
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:16,109
I can't believe I'm hearin'
all this ravin' and rantin'

777
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:19,263
From Vanessa up here
at New Detroit Stampin'

778
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:22,423
Need to get your food
and take your ass back to work

779
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,389
You're dreamin' if you think
them corny-ass raps'll work

780
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:28,908
Look at y'all standin' here
freezing like dumb-fucks

781
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,624
Rappin' and waitin' for food
off this raggedy lunch truck

782
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,941
Who want what?
Who pumped up to get rolled up?

783
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:36,824
I spit venom in every direction
Soak some up

784
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:40,460
Look at this fat-ass nigga
Sloppy sucka

785
00:51:40,672 --> 00:51:43,788
You a ugly motherfucker
Your pops should've wore a rubber

786
00:51:43,951 --> 00:51:46,306
Stop rhyming
Keep your day job, Vanessa

787
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,826
Next time leave that bullshit
home on the dresser

788
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:51,984
Speakin' of dresses
Take a look at Paul the fruitcake

789
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:55,391
When you travel
you pack panties in your suitcase

790
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:57,621
Made out of lace
from Victoria's Secret

791
00:51:57,712 --> 00:52:00,226
If 10 men came in a cup,
you'd probably drink it

792
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:07,346
Okay, folks
Enough with the gay jokes

793
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,547
Especially from a gay,
broke bitch yourself

794
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:10,701
Eh, loc?

795
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:12,746
His style's doo-doo

796
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:15,904
You've worked here longer than me
and I get paid more than you do

797
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:17,587
Dawg, take a seat

798
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:20,511
Why's this guy standing in line?
He ain't got money to eat

799
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,185
Check this out
Yo, yo

800
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,822
He cashed his whole check
And bought one Ho Ho

801
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:29,632
Fucking homo, little maggot
You can't hack it

802
00:52:30,033 --> 00:52:31,830
Paul's gay
You're a faggot

803
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:33,790
Least he admits it,
don't even risk it

804
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:36,672
This guy's starving to death
Someone get him a biscuit

805
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:39,710
I don't know
what they told you, Mike

806
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:42,069
You musta had them cornrows
rolled too tight

807
00:52:42,313 --> 00:52:44,668
This job
You want to quit, but you can't

808
00:52:44,752 --> 00:52:47,313
You've worked at this plant so long
You're a plant!

809
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:49,866
Look at your goddamn boots

810
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:52,308
For Christsakes
They're starting to grow roots!

811
00:52:53,953 --> 00:52:55,467
On this mic, you get faded

812
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,746
You look like a pissed-off rapper
who never made it

813
00:52:59,034 --> 00:53:01,150
Hey, why you fuckin'
with the gay guy, G?

814
00:53:01,234 --> 00:53:03,701
When really you're the one
who's got the HIV

815
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:06,670
Man, I'm done with this clown
He's soft

816
00:53:06,993 --> 00:53:09,110
Fuck it
I'll let homegirl finish you off

817
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:14,826
A guy like you
would never get a real woman

818
00:53:14,913 --> 00:53:17,587
Jackass, go jack off
That's the only way you comin'

819
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:20,152
Looking for your brother?

820
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:21,268
I was.

821
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:27,111
You want to do something tonight?

822
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:30,188
Are you asking me out on a date,
Jimmy Smith, Jr.?

823
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:33,588
As a matter of fact, I am.

824
00:53:35,235 --> 00:53:37,146
Why don't you take me somewhere now?

825
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:41,983
Come on.

826
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,028
Where are we going?

827
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,311
You were so good outside.

828
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,193
In line at the lunch truck?

829
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,675
And at the Chin Tiki
the other night.

830
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,758
And that demo thing with Wink.

831
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,592
You're going to get a deal soon.

832
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,430
You was in the parking lot
the other night?

833
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,238
My friends think you're crazy.

834
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,072
Your friends don't even know me!

835
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,188
Ain't nobody here.

836
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,356
I can't believe
he got sent home already.

837
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,398
No insurance, the medical
establishment will fuck you.

838
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,552
Where else would he be?

839
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:57,193
Just thank God he's alive.

840
00:56:57,521 --> 00:57:00,034
No, thank God
he didn't shoot his dick off.

841
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,360
That's why brothers
need to get a deal.

842
00:57:03,441 --> 00:57:06,034
Record labels
supply niggas with benefits.

843
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,637
Dawg, we get a deal,
you can take the fucking benefits.

844
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:12,918
We'll have Bentleys and Benjamins,
not Blue Cross.

845
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,952
I don't give a fuck about that.

846
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:17,271
I just want to hear Three One Third
on the box.

847
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,874
One of them songs on JLB.

848
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:22,237
We need to save,
put it into savings bonds...

849
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,639
and build our own studio.

850
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,916
- Savings bonds?
- Let me ask you something.

851
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:27,960
How are we brothers?

852
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:31,432
We need fine bitches and phat rides,
not savings bonds.

853
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:33,513
All we ever do is talk shit!

854
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:36,518
''We need fine bitches
and phat rides.''

855
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:38,752
''We need to invest
in savings bonds.''

856
00:57:38,841 --> 00:57:41,071
''We need to get our songs on JLB.''

857
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:43,591
Shut the fuck up!
And we never do shit.

858
00:57:43,682 --> 00:57:46,071
We're still broke
and live at home with our mums.

859
00:57:48,562 --> 00:57:50,553
I'm out of here. Catch you later.

860
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,191
Get your mad, rambling ass
in the car.

861
00:57:54,402 --> 00:57:56,279
I hope you get
a new ride soon, Rabbit.

862
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:58,591
Maybe for that
birthday tripping ass.

863
00:57:59,281 --> 00:58:02,115
I'll call your momma.
See what I can work out.

864
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:04,595
I got shotgun, Shabba.

865
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:08,515
Get in the back, Farrakhan.

866
00:58:46,363 --> 00:58:48,115
Why are you pretending
to be asleep?

867
00:58:49,364 --> 00:58:51,002
I seen you out the window, Bob.

868
00:58:53,004 --> 00:58:54,403
I didn't feel like talking.

869
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:56,799
Why not?

870
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:02,560
I didn't want them making fun of me.

871
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,761
You know what I'm saying, Rabbit?

872
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:07,033
Yeah.

873
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:09,232
You do?

874
00:59:10,323 --> 00:59:11,312
MC Bob.

875
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:36,161
Like you see in magazines.

876
00:59:37,405 --> 00:59:38,394
What up?

877
00:59:38,684 --> 00:59:40,960
Hey, Rabbit. Where have you been?

878
00:59:41,284 --> 00:59:42,798
You call him Rabbit, too?

879
00:59:44,045 --> 00:59:45,523
I gave him that nickname.

880
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:48,557
-Stop it.
-I did, when he was little.

881
00:59:48,645 --> 00:59:52,001
He had buckteeth and big ears.

882
00:59:52,085 --> 00:59:53,996
He was so cute.

883
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:58,273
Like a little rabbit.
Right, baby?

884
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:24,595
I got good news.

885
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,995
You brought her to my mum's?
What the fuck?

886
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:29,999
I invited her to my show.
She said we had to come get you.

887
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:31,486
What was I supposed to do?

888
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:34,767
I've been helping Al
find a photographer for her book.

889
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,883
All she keeps saying
is how much she likes you.

890
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:41,606
Damn! Now check this, dawg.

891
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,564
I heard from my man Roy today...

892
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,763
that he's gonna be
at JLB tomorrow night...

893
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:47,327
for the interview with Big O.

894
01:00:47,408 --> 01:00:48,999
- So what?
- So what?

895
01:00:49,088 --> 01:00:52,796
I told him about your skills!
I said, ''Rabbit's your man.''

896
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:55,959
He said, ''Bring him down.
Let me see what he can do.''

897
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:59,756
If it goes well, you could be
flowing at 54 Sound next week.

898
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:03,718
Can you get
your shit together in time?

899
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:08,723
I can do it.

900
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:13,203
-My bad, man.
-No problem, dawg.

901
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:15,323
Big time, Jimmy.

902
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:18,156
Why'd you take off?

903
01:01:19,368 --> 01:01:20,595
I don't really live here.

904
01:01:20,687 --> 01:01:22,917
So? Why'd you take off?

905
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:24,917
I just....

906
01:01:31,728 --> 01:01:34,083
Don't be embarrassed
about where you live.

907
01:01:34,168 --> 01:01:35,284
I don't live here.

908
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:39,407
What's up with you and Wink?

909
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:41,766
He's helping me
get my book together.

910
01:01:43,248 --> 01:01:44,523
Using his connections.

911
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:46,846
Same way he's helping you out.

912
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:51,003
So....

913
01:01:52,889 --> 01:01:54,800
You have to stay home tonight?

914
01:01:58,809 --> 01:01:59,958
Yeah, I should...

915
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:02,445
work on some songs for my demo.

916
01:02:03,288 --> 01:02:04,277
Okay.

917
01:03:33,611 --> 01:03:35,091
Your mum's getting evicted.

918
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:38,887
It says right here.

919
01:03:40,091 --> 01:03:42,242
''Tenant must vacate the premises...

920
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:44,892
''due to non-payment of rent.''

921
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:47,006
You know about this?

922
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:48,365
'Morning.

923
01:03:49,812 --> 01:03:51,245
Sweetie, you want cereal?

924
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:56,044
I was talking to your precious son
about this eviction situation.

925
01:03:58,012 --> 01:03:59,809
Did you plan on informing me?

926
01:03:59,892 --> 01:04:01,847
Honey, that's a mistake.

927
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:03,843
-You're a fucking liar.
-Hey, man!

928
01:04:04,613 --> 01:04:06,012
Stay out of this, Rabbit.

929
01:04:06,452 --> 01:04:09,171
-Don't worry. I'm taking care of it.
-Don't.

930
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:14,004
Fuck, man! What is your problem?
Don't touch my mother!

931
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:15,606
Stay out of it!

932
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:21,242
I'm out of here. I can't go out
with someone like you.

933
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:23,289
You gonna let him say that to you?

934
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:25,204
With two homeless kids.

935
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:26,772
Motherfucker!

936
01:04:29,653 --> 01:04:30,722
Rabbit!

937
01:04:32,253 --> 01:04:34,209
Jimmy! Please!

938
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,204
Stop it!

939
01:04:39,332 --> 01:04:40,287
Stop!

940
01:04:40,372 --> 01:04:41,408
Fuck you!

941
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:45,651
Rabbit, stop!

942
01:04:45,734 --> 01:04:48,452
- Fuck you!
- Stop it!

943
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,251
Oh, my God. Lily.

944
01:05:06,454 --> 01:05:07,488
Come here, baby.

945
01:05:10,093 --> 01:05:11,048
It's okay.

946
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:14,003
Come here, baby.

947
01:05:18,093 --> 01:05:19,162
It's okay.

948
01:05:27,574 --> 01:05:30,168
It's over, baby.

949
01:05:48,735 --> 01:05:49,962
What up, dawg?

950
01:05:52,174 --> 01:05:53,574
Alex just called.

951
01:05:54,215 --> 01:05:57,446
I got a friend to take pictures
of her when she gets off work.

952
01:05:57,895 --> 01:06:01,011
She needs a ride, that's why
she called. Can you drive?

953
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,565
- I'll drive.
- The others'll be here soon.

954
01:06:03,656 --> 01:06:08,048
Sol's mum's dropping them off.
I hear you're battling tomorrow.

955
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:09,206
I'm doing what?

956
01:06:10,336 --> 01:06:12,771
Someone told me Future signed you up
at The Shelter.

957
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:14,006
Who told you that?

958
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:25,131
What up?

959
01:06:26,177 --> 01:06:27,291
Wipe your feet.

960
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,765
Nobody's wiping their feet
for your junky basement.

961
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:31,289
Where your momma at?

962
01:06:32,097 --> 01:06:33,052
Working.

963
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:34,251
Dear momma!

964
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:36,851
Tell her to hang this shit upstairs.

965
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:39,814
Did you sign me up to battle
tomorrow night?

966
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,938
You heard me.
Don't play fucking stupid. Did you?

967
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:48,651
Papa Doc won last week,
so he'll be defending his title.

968
01:06:49,418 --> 01:06:53,251
You got to take it from him!
You win battles, you get respect.

969
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:54,532
I don't give a fuck!

970
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:56,813
I'm sick of you thinking
you know what's best!

971
01:06:56,898 --> 01:06:59,253
You ain't my fucking father!
I'm a grown man.

972
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:01,169
Look, Jimmy--
''Look'' nothing!

973
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:03,334
Fuck you!
I told you not to sign me up!

974
01:07:03,537 --> 01:07:05,289
So you want to fight me now?

975
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:08,416
You ain't the future of shit.
You're just David fucking Porter.

976
01:07:10,338 --> 01:07:11,612
Hey, come on, fellas.

977
01:07:16,218 --> 01:07:17,570
You know what?

978
01:07:18,378 --> 01:07:20,015
Do what the fuck you want to do.

979
01:07:22,098 --> 01:07:24,009
I don't give a shit anymore.

980
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:28,852
I really fucking don't!

981
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:43,252
You coming to JLB tonight?

982
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:45,373
I don't know, man.

983
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:55,768
I look like crap.

984
01:07:56,179 --> 01:08:00,411
If I knew it was today, I wouldn't
have gone drinking after the show.

985
01:08:00,498 --> 01:08:03,094
- I can reschedule.
- No, I'll do it.

986
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,535
- You will?
- I'll always do it.

987
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,180
When will we see your pictorial
in a magazine?

988
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:10,933
Pictorial's in Playboy.
In fashion, it's editorial.

989
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,931
Shut up, Frederick Douglass.

990
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,580
It's for her book,
so she can get a job.

991
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,651
That's one book I'd definitely read.

992
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,013
 It'd be the only one.

993
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:35,616
- Don't forget this.
- Thanks, guys.

994
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,379
Want me to come up?

995
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:43,256
That's okay.

996
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:05,896
Mum.

997
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:10,533
Mum, come on, get up.

998
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,009
Come on.

999
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:18,414
Greg left me.

1000
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,050
Greg left me.

1001
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:25,536
Damn!

1002
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,415
Get up.

1003
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,021
It's okay, Lily.

1004
01:09:29,142 --> 01:09:30,177
It's okay, honey.

1005
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:37,219
His settlement cheque came.

1006
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,213
His settlement cheque came in.

1007
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:43,732
And now that he's got money...

1008
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:46,496
he can't be with
somebody like me anymore.

1009
01:09:49,222 --> 01:09:52,577
It's Thursday. I got to go to bingo.

1010
01:09:52,862 --> 01:09:54,500
Maybe he'll be there.

1011
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:57,580
You ain't going nowhere.
You're better off without him.

1012
01:09:58,222 --> 01:10:00,418
Stop it! It's your fault he left me!

1013
01:10:00,503 --> 01:10:03,700
You ruined it!
You fucked it all up for me!

1014
01:10:06,663 --> 01:10:08,062
Who's gonna want me now?

1015
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:12,415
Where are we gonna live?
We don't have any money!

1016
01:10:12,703 --> 01:10:15,580
We don't have anything!
What am I gonna do?

1017
01:10:16,143 --> 01:10:17,895
What am I gonna do?

1018
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:21,061
What are you gonna do?
Lily's out there by herself!

1019
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:24,101
Why do you have to be like this?
What'd we ever do to you?

1020
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:27,812
Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out of my house!

1021
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:30,812
Get the fuck out of my house!

1022
01:10:33,823 --> 01:10:35,814
Come on, baby. Put your coat on.

1023
01:10:38,423 --> 01:10:39,902
We're going next door, okay?

1024
01:10:40,664 --> 01:10:42,062
We're getting out of here.

1025
01:11:13,864 --> 01:11:15,661
-What floor is JLB on?
-Twenty-eighth.

1026
01:11:15,744 --> 01:11:17,018
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1027
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:19,980
When we look at Big O,
what are we looking at?

1028
01:11:20,065 --> 01:11:23,102
I'm giving you poverty, slums.
That's where I'm from.

1029
01:11:23,184 --> 01:11:25,096
So I put it all in the music.

1030
01:11:25,224 --> 01:11:27,455
-I'm looking for Wink Harris.
-Who?

1031
01:11:27,545 --> 01:11:29,297
He should be here with Roy Darucher.

1032
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,340
I think they're all in Studio B.

1033
01:11:31,545 --> 01:11:32,500
Thank you.

1034
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:35,383
I did anything I could for free,
just for the exposure.

1035
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:38,976
No doubt. Big O, big ups
and congratulations...

1036
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:40,738
playboy player.

1037
01:11:40,825 --> 01:11:44,181
You finally got your record
on the radio. How do you feel?

1038
01:11:44,264 --> 01:11:47,302
Much love, man.
I want to thank you and WJLB...

1039
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:49,660
for looking out for me like that.
That was much love.

1040
01:11:49,745 --> 01:11:53,054
I'm just trying to put Detroit,
the East Side, on the map, you know?

1041
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:55,703
We're gonna do it for real, man.

1042
01:11:55,786 --> 01:11:57,457
I hope we'll get a pipeline
through here...

1043
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:00,015
and the industry will look at us
and sign us.

1044
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,176
We'll all be eating.

1045
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:06,782
Stop it!

1046
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:12,057
I've seen you flippin' burgers!

1047
01:12:12,386 --> 01:12:13,581
Yeah, I did that.

1048
01:12:13,707 --> 01:12:16,460
I thought I recognised your face.
I know you been....

1049
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:21,420
Stop it! Please, Jimmy, stop!

1050
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:26,540
-How long you been in the game?
-Roughly 15 years.

1051
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:35,576
It's an honour for me to come on
and have you do this for me.

1052
01:12:35,787 --> 01:12:38,063
- I really appreciate it.
- No problem.

1053
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:39,866
We're here to represent the D...

1054
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:42,256
take care of our artists
and take care of home.

1055
01:12:42,348 --> 01:12:44,908
I hope you have
a successful career...

1056
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:46,626
'cause I know
you're puttin' it down.

1057
01:12:46,707 --> 01:12:48,938
You represent real hard for the1.

1058
01:12:49,028 --> 01:12:50,904
I'm doing it for y'all, man.

1059
01:12:50,988 --> 01:12:53,058
This is for Detroit,1, baby!
Love!

1060
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:40,382
- Thanks, Mrs. Helgeland.
- Any time.

1061
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:41,697
Have a good night.

1062
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:46,105
You have fun?

1063
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:48,217
Yeah, I know.

1064
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,304
I want you to go inside
and lock the door, okay?

1065
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,345
Listen to me.

1066
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,422
Go in, lock the door
and I'll be in in a minute.

1067
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,900
-Okay.
-Okay, go.

1068
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:14,299
Go!

1069
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,859
What up, bitch?

1070
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,462
Ready to get knocked out, dawg?

1071
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,300
Wink said you lived in a trailer
with your mum.

1072
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,789
But we didn't believe him.

1073
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,228
Come on, Elvis. Get up.

1074
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,266
Get up, bitch.

1075
01:14:38,991 --> 01:14:40,902
Get your faggot ass up and fight!

1076
01:14:47,671 --> 01:14:49,945
What? What the fuck you looking at?

1077
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:00,820
Jimmy!

1078
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:14,498
Get the fuck up.

1079
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,348
Stop it!

1080
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:20,343
Fight me, you punk-ass bitch!

1081
01:15:30,712 --> 01:15:34,864
I could end your shit right now
and nobody would even miss your ass.

1082
01:15:36,592 --> 01:15:38,662
No, no. Don't do this.

1083
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:40,741
Come on.

1084
01:15:41,272 --> 01:15:42,261
He's done.

1085
01:15:48,352 --> 01:15:50,024
Free World, motherfucker.

1086
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:59,466
Don't forget to come
to The Shelter tomorrow night.

1087
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:03,142
You little faggot.
I mean, little Rabbit.

1088
01:16:31,312 --> 01:16:32,382
Jesus.

1089
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:35,669
-What happened to you?
-I fell.

1090
01:16:37,074 --> 01:16:38,189
You fell?

1091
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:40,789
I fell.

1092
01:16:43,513 --> 01:16:45,744
Come in.
I'll make you something to eat.

1093
01:16:46,314 --> 01:16:47,383
What?

1094
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:49,783
I'm your mother.

1095
01:16:49,874 --> 01:16:52,593
I want to make you something to eat.
What's the big deal?

1096
01:17:08,513 --> 01:17:10,266
I thought you wanted me out.

1097
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,672
You want the fucking pancakes?

1098
01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:18,348
What's gotten into you?

1099
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:20,985
- We're not getting evicted.
- Why not?

1100
01:17:21,915 --> 01:17:22,950
I went to bingo.

1101
01:17:25,195 --> 01:17:26,389
And I won!

1102
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:31,152
$, 200!

1103
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:34,590
-You're kidding me.
-Nope!

1104
01:17:35,355 --> 01:17:37,710
Our luck's finally changing
around here.

1105
01:17:41,515 --> 01:17:43,984
Did you mean it
about doing the demo with Wink?

1106
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:50,945
No.

1107
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:53,996
I'm gonna do it on my own.

1108
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:02,714
You know, Rabbit,
I think that's the best way.

1109
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:28,152
Hey, Smith!

1110
01:18:30,597 --> 01:18:31,996
Hey, Smith!

1111
01:18:41,077 --> 01:18:42,591
Are you all right?

1112
01:18:42,758 --> 01:18:44,111
I fell down some steps.

1113
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:48,915
You been doing much better here.

1114
01:18:49,118 --> 01:18:50,948
Still want the extra shifts?

1115
01:18:51,037 --> 01:18:51,948
Yeah.

1116
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:55,396
You got them. I need you
to work tonight. I'm a man short.

1117
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:57,353
Tonight?

1118
01:18:57,518 --> 01:18:59,429
-Is that a problem?
-No problem.

1119
01:19:00,398 --> 01:19:01,353
Good.

1120
01:19:02,478 --> 01:19:04,036
Get back to work.

1121
01:19:09,118 --> 01:19:10,153
Manny!

1122
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,274
Thanks.

1123
01:19:21,759 --> 01:19:22,873
What up?

1124
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,519
Shit. Waiting on this slow-ass ride.

1125
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,357
What are you still doing here?

1126
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:31,349
Someone's sick, so I'm filling in.

1127
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,112
She ain't waiting on me.

1128
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:45,748
I'll be back.

1129
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,635
What do you want?

1130
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,949
I wanted to say goodbye.
I'm going to New York.

1131
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:05,230
Yeah? And....

1132
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,435
Can I give you a ride or something?

1133
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:13,349
No, I'm cool.

1134
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,073
I'm working overtime.

1135
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,877
Saving up for something special?

1136
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,797
Yeah, studio time.

1137
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,748
Good.

1138
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,274
Good for you.

1139
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,391
I was hoping to see you
at The Shelter tonight.

1140
01:20:33,321 --> 01:20:34,720
But, if you're afraid--

1141
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:36,314
I ain't afraid of them guys.

1142
01:20:38,761 --> 01:20:40,034
I didn't say you were.

1143
01:20:45,081 --> 01:20:46,069
'Bye.

1144
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,069
Paul, would you mind covering for me
for a couple hours?

1145
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:00,634
I can do that.

1146
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:02,958
Thanks, man. I owe you.

1147
01:21:14,362 --> 01:21:15,999
It's Rabbit! Hey!

1148
01:21:17,962 --> 01:21:19,077
Rabbit, wait up!

1149
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:24,797
What's up, man?

1150
01:21:26,322 --> 01:21:27,755
What happened to you?

1151
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:30,310
- You straight? Look at your eye.
- I'm fine.

1152
01:21:30,401 --> 01:21:33,997
Wink said you blew up 'cause
Roy Darucher said no to your demo.

1153
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:36,276
He also said crazy shit
about him and Alex.

1154
01:21:36,362 --> 01:21:38,114
We gonna jump those guys again?

1155
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:41,910
Fuck that. I'm gonna battle them.

1156
01:21:44,162 --> 01:21:45,231
For real?

1157
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:47,591
Yeah.

1158
01:21:57,243 --> 01:21:58,596
You guys coming or what?

1159
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:04,561
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred

1160
01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:07,521
Cheddar cheese
There's not a better MC than me

1161
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:08,797
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch

1162
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:11,271
Sting like a bee,
float like a butterfly

1163
01:22:11,363 --> 01:22:13,672
What am I?
So what if I cut a guy?

1164
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:15,794
Did I s-s-stutter, guy?

1165
01:22:15,883 --> 01:22:18,271
Leave you punch drunk
From lunch truck to Shelter

1166
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:20,399
You never felt the wrath
of Helter Skelter

1167
01:22:20,483 --> 01:22:23,758
Melt ya, got the belt
for the welterweight champ

1168
01:22:24,123 --> 01:22:25,841
You got in with a fake stamp

1169
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:29,075
Garbage bag full of clothes
Still pullin' ho's

1170
01:22:29,204 --> 01:22:31,764
Rip you from head to toe
From leg to bullet hole

1171
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:33,521
Next gun, pull it slow

1172
01:22:33,644 --> 01:22:35,838
Aim at Tha Free World
'fore you let it go

1173
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,478
Instead of,
''Oh, I just shot my dick head!''

1174
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:40,914
Yes, you do got a big head

1175
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:43,074
I can't call it
Cheddar, where's your wallet?

1176
01:22:43,164 --> 01:22:45,597
You're so drunk,
you can outdrink the ''Alkaholiks''

1177
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:48,273
Make 'em say, ''Damn,
Cheddar's the man!''

1178
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:51,283
He needs a can
surgically removed from his hand

1179
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,158
You again?

1180
01:22:57,284 --> 01:23:01,163
It looks like a handicap convention
in here. Crippled motherfuckers.

1181
01:23:02,364 --> 01:23:03,353
Don't shoot!

1182
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:17,199
Yo, let's get the fuck out of here.

1183
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,041
I need to get some privacy, guys.

1184
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:34,955
Can I come?

1185
01:23:43,005 --> 01:23:43,916
Hey, man...

1186
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:47,278
-I apologise for--
-Stop it.

1187
01:23:47,806 --> 01:23:48,922
Don't do it.

1188
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:51,035
I didn't even trip.

1189
01:23:52,647 --> 01:23:54,126
Just make sure...

1190
01:23:54,767 --> 01:23:57,964
you flip the script
on this shit tonight.

1191
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:00,121
You understand me?

1192
01:24:06,847 --> 01:24:07,802
Thank you.

1193
01:24:08,007 --> 01:24:09,406
It's on tonight, Rabbit.

1194
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:14,880
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

1195
01:24:20,687 --> 01:24:21,802
All right, all right!

1196
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:25,559
How y'all feeling out there?
You feeling all right?

1197
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:30,366
All right!
Next up is LC, Lyckety-Splyt...

1198
01:24:30,968 --> 01:24:32,083
Slaughter him.

1199
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,363
...and my man B-Rabbit.
B-Rabbit, where you at?

1200
01:24:35,008 --> 01:24:36,885
B-Rabbit, come to the stage!

1201
01:24:39,128 --> 01:24:40,880
Where the fuck is B-Rabbit?

1202
01:24:43,168 --> 01:24:45,523
- Where's he at?
- They're calling you!

1203
01:24:45,608 --> 01:24:47,963
You drew Lyckety-Splyt
in the first round.

1204
01:24:48,128 --> 01:24:50,197
- You okay with that?
- Yeah.

1205
01:24:51,688 --> 01:24:53,280
I don't give a fuck who it is.

1206
01:24:55,447 --> 01:24:56,483
Okay.

1207
01:24:57,407 --> 01:24:58,887
Where the fuck is B-Rabbit?

1208
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:02,599
Come to the stage.
You got everybody waiting.

1209
01:25:03,728 --> 01:25:06,606
It's gonna be blazin'
in this bitch tonight.

1210
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:09,960
We got a lot of dope rappers,
and at the end of the night...

1211
01:25:10,049 --> 01:25:13,086
one will battle last week's winner,
Papa Doc.

1212
01:25:13,729 --> 01:25:16,368
This shit will be off the hook,
so stick around.

1213
01:25:16,448 --> 01:25:20,203
Come to the stage, Rabbit.
Come to the stage!

1214
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:24,129
B-Rabbit, where you at?
There he is. Come on.

1215
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:27,118
Make way for the Rabbit.
Let him through.

1216
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:30,839
Let the artist
get to the motherfucking stage.

1217
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:34,438
Come on, B-Rabbit.

1218
01:25:34,649 --> 01:25:35,877
Let him up.

1219
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:37,678
You good?

1220
01:25:38,328 --> 01:25:39,318
Choose.

1221
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:40,479
Heads.

1222
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:44,444
You got it.

1223
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:47,800
I'll go first
against this choke artist.

1224
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:51,519
You got enough confidence.
Do your thing! Forty-five seconds.

1225
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,965
Spin that shit!

1226
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:55,999
Free World, nigga.

1227
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:59,049
I'll tell you something

1228
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,169
Check this out

1229
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,639
This guy's a choke artist
You catch a bad one

1230
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:11,483
You better off shootin' yourself
with Papa Doc's handgun

1231
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,408
Climbing up this mountain
You're weak

1232
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:16,209
I leave you lost without a paddle
Floating up shit's creek

1233
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:18,962
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D
You the New Kid on the Block

1234
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,200
'Bout to get smacked
back to the boondocks

1235
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,042
Fucking Nazi,
your squad ain't your type

1236
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:25,964
Take some real advice
Form a group with Vanilla Ice

1237
01:26:26,051 --> 01:26:28,087
What I tell you,
you better use it

1238
01:26:28,171 --> 01:26:30,765
This guy's a hillbilly
This ain't Willie Nelson music

1239
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:33,001
Trailer trash
I'll choke you to your last breath

1240
01:26:33,091 --> 01:26:35,889
Have you look foolish like
Cheddar Bob when he shot himself

1241
01:26:35,971 --> 01:26:37,801
Silly Rabbit,
I know why you called that

1242
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:40,689
You follow Future
Like he got carrots up his ass crack

1243
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,761
When you acted up,
You got jacked up

1244
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:45,490
Left stupid like Tina Turner
when she got smacked up

1245
01:26:45,571 --> 01:26:46,845
I'll crack your shoulder blade

1246
01:26:46,931 --> 01:26:50,002
You'll drop so hard
Elvis'll turn in his grave

1247
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:52,287
I don't know why
they let you out in the dark?

1248
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:55,010
Take your white ass
across 8 Mile to the trailer park

1249
01:27:00,571 --> 01:27:02,687
Okay, okay.

1250
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:05,525
Very nice, very nice.
Let me get the mike.

1251
01:27:05,612 --> 01:27:08,490
Pretty good. Hip-hop 101.

1252
01:27:08,572 --> 01:27:11,086
Bunny Rabbit, it's your turn, baby.

1253
01:27:11,652 --> 01:27:12,971
Forty-five seconds.

1254
01:27:13,052 --> 01:27:14,882
Let this motherfucker feel it!

1255
01:27:15,932 --> 01:27:17,251
DJ, spin that shit!

1256
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:23,411
Come on, Rabbit!

1257
01:27:23,732 --> 01:27:25,051
Don't choke this time.

1258
01:27:32,412 --> 01:27:33,845
All right, look.

1259
01:27:34,572 --> 01:27:36,130
He's choking!

1260
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:44,047
Hey, yo

1261
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:47,369
This guy raps
like his parents jerked him

1262
01:27:47,453 --> 01:27:50,206
He sounds like Erick Sermon
The generic version

1263
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:52,131
This crowd looks suspicious

1264
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:54,646
It's all dudes here,
except for these bitches

1265
01:27:55,493 --> 01:27:57,449
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay

1266
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:59,728
You look like a fuckin' worm
with braids

1267
01:27:59,853 --> 01:28:01,684
These Leadaz Of Tha Free World
rookies

1268
01:28:01,773 --> 01:28:04,082
Lookie
How can six dicks be pussies?

1269
01:28:05,132 --> 01:28:06,646
Talkin' about shit's creek?

1270
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:09,201
You could be up piss creek
with paddles, this deep

1271
01:28:09,293 --> 01:28:10,646
You're still gonna sink

1272
01:28:10,733 --> 01:28:11,529
You're a disgrace

1273
01:28:11,613 --> 01:28:13,922
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race

1274
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:16,010
He can't get with me,
spittin' this shit

1275
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:17,287
Wickedly lickin' these shots

1276
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:19,204
To spiggy, spiggity
split lickety

1277
01:28:20,213 --> 01:28:22,090
Now I'm gonna turn around
with a great smile

1278
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:24,688
And walk my white ass
back across 8 Mile

1279
01:28:30,654 --> 01:28:33,088
Say no more!
That's what I'm talking about.

1280
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:34,402
It's unanimous!

1281
01:28:34,814 --> 01:28:36,805
Bunny Rabbit goes to the next round!

1282
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:39,646
Lyckety, tell your momma
I'll be over later.

1283
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:41,367
She can save me a plate.

1284
01:28:42,014 --> 01:28:45,086
- You killed him. Good shit.
- That's what I'm saying.

1285
01:28:45,174 --> 01:28:46,653
Hold up, hold up.

1286
01:28:46,734 --> 01:28:48,485
Next up, we got...

1287
01:28:49,134 --> 01:28:52,762
Ox and Strike.
Come to the stage, motherfuckers.

1288
01:28:52,854 --> 01:28:53,923
Yo, Rabbit!

1289
01:29:10,415 --> 01:29:12,370
Okay, B-Rabbit. Call it.

1290
01:29:12,455 --> 01:29:13,410
Heads.

1291
01:29:14,455 --> 01:29:16,047
Heads. Choose.

1292
01:29:17,214 --> 01:29:19,730
Lotto, it's on you, baby. You first.

1293
01:29:20,536 --> 01:29:22,367
- Don't matter.
- DJ, spin that shit!

1294
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:28,685
- He's always taking his shirt off.
- I'm gonna smash this bastard.

1295
01:29:31,896 --> 01:29:33,852
Free World
in the motherfuckin' house.

1296
01:29:34,295 --> 01:29:37,368
It's time to get rid of this coward
once and for all.

1297
01:29:38,856 --> 01:29:40,414
I'm sick of this motherfucker.

1298
01:29:40,496 --> 01:29:42,612
Rip him, Lotto! Rip him, baby!

1299
01:29:46,737 --> 01:29:48,648
I'll spit a racial slur, honky
Sue me

1300
01:29:48,817 --> 01:29:50,011
This shit is a horror flick

1301
01:29:50,097 --> 01:29:52,166
But the black guy
doesn't die in this movie

1302
01:29:52,257 --> 01:29:54,293
Fuckin' with Lotto
You got to be kiddin'

1303
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:56,977
That makes me believe
you've no interest in livin'

1304
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,812
You think these niggas
gonna feel the shit you say?

1305
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:02,371
I got a better chance
joining the KKK

1306
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:04,527
On some real shit, though?
I like you

1307
01:30:04,617 --> 01:30:07,734
That's why I didn't want to be
the one you commit suicide to

1308
01:30:07,817 --> 01:30:09,614
Fuck Lotto
Call me your leader

1309
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:12,773
I feel bad I gotta murder
that dude from Leave it to Beaver

1310
01:30:13,097 --> 01:30:15,974
I used to like that show
Now I'm in fight-back mode

1311
01:30:16,057 --> 01:30:18,013
Oh, well
If you got to go, you got to go

1312
01:30:18,257 --> 01:30:20,487
I hate to do this
I'd love for this shit to last

1313
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:23,775
I'll take pictures of my rear end
So you won't forget my ass

1314
01:30:23,858 --> 01:30:25,371
All's well that ends okay

1315
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:29,007
So I'll end this shit with
''Fuck you, but have a nice day!''

1316
01:30:35,538 --> 01:30:37,449
Whoa, okay, okay.

1317
01:30:38,378 --> 01:30:40,414
Can't be mad, can't be bad.

1318
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:42,375
You killed that fucked-up white boy.

1319
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:43,652
That ain't shit.

1320
01:30:44,777 --> 01:30:47,291
Settle down.
Give the man a chance.

1321
01:30:47,737 --> 01:30:50,456
Bunny Rabbit's up next.
All right, B-Rabbit.

1322
01:30:51,258 --> 01:30:54,614
You got the mike. It's on you.
You know what to do.

1323
01:30:54,817 --> 01:30:56,376
DJ, spin that shit!

1324
01:31:01,738 --> 01:31:03,296
You got something?

1325
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:07,292
You can't fuck with us!

1326
01:31:08,459 --> 01:31:09,972
Let's see what you got.

1327
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:14,170
- Come on, Rabbit!
- Get him!

1328
01:31:19,698 --> 01:31:22,338
"Ward, I think you were
a little hard on the Beaver"

1329
01:31:22,539 --> 01:31:25,099
So was Eddie Haskell,
Wally and Miz Cleaver

1330
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:27,888
This guy keeps screaming
He's paranoid

1331
01:31:27,979 --> 01:31:30,368
Quick, someone get his ass
another steroid

1332
01:31:30,579 --> 01:31:33,046
Blah-biddy, bloo-blah
blah-blah-biddy, bloo-blah

1333
01:31:33,139 --> 01:31:35,892
I ain't hear a word you said
Hippety hoo-plah

1334
01:31:36,299 --> 01:31:38,335
Is that a tank top or a new bra?

1335
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:40,848
Look, Snoop Dogg
just got a fuckin' boob job

1336
01:31:40,939 --> 01:31:43,010
Didn't you listen to
the last round, meathead?

1337
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,488
Pay attention
You're saying the same shit he said

1338
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,298
Matter of fact, dawg
Here's a pencil

1339
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:50,848
Go home, write some shit
Make it suspenseful

1340
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:53,693
Don't come back
'til something dope hits you

1341
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:56,294
Fuck it
You can take the mic home wit' you

1342
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,737
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you

1343
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:01,499
Tank top screaming,
''Lotto, I don't fit you!''

1344
01:32:02,019 --> 01:32:03,975
You see how far
them white jokes get you

1345
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,448
Boys like,
''How's Vanilla Ice gon' dis you?''

1346
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,938
My motto.;
Fuck Lotto

1347
01:32:09,019 --> 01:32:11,818
I'll get the seven digits from your
mother for a dollar tomorrow

1348
01:32:22,701 --> 01:32:24,612
It's real as it feels!

1349
01:32:25,981 --> 01:32:30,054
Hold on! That was some close shit.
Let's see what's poppin'.

1350
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,091
How y'all feel about Lotto?

1351
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,821
Okay! B-Rabbit?

1352
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:43,975
Let's do it again.
It's hard to judge.

1353
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:45,700
We'll start with Lotto.

1354
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:53,019
Okay, lotta love, lotta love!

1355
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:55,089
What about B-Rabbit?

1356
01:32:58,821 --> 01:33:00,301
Say no more!

1357
01:33:01,982 --> 01:33:04,449
B-Rabbit advances to the next round!

1358
01:33:04,582 --> 01:33:07,176
He goes to the finals
against Papa Doc!

1359
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:09,134
That's the way it's going down.

1360
01:33:09,462 --> 01:33:12,738
Okay, check this.
15-minute intermission.

1361
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:16,260
Make sure you tip the bartenders.
15 minutes.

1362
01:33:16,702 --> 01:33:18,613
You did your thing, man.

1363
01:33:18,702 --> 01:33:22,172
That's okay, 'cause Wink got more
than seven digits from your bitch!

1364
01:33:26,942 --> 01:33:28,216
You did it, kid.

1365
01:33:32,422 --> 01:33:34,936
Fuck him. Fuck Lyckety, man.

1366
01:33:37,742 --> 01:33:40,052
That Beaver line almost killed me.

1367
01:33:40,143 --> 01:33:41,496
But you flipped it.

1368
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:44,336
You got it, man.
You're a fucking genius.

1369
01:33:44,783 --> 01:33:47,502
Make sure you serve this clown
in the next round for me.

1370
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:50,654
-Whip Papa Doc's ass!
-He's got no vocabulary.

1371
01:33:50,743 --> 01:33:52,495
You worried about what he'll say?

1372
01:33:53,783 --> 01:33:54,818
What do you mean?

1373
01:33:54,903 --> 01:33:57,736
About Wink and that Alex bitch
getting it on...

1374
01:33:57,863 --> 01:34:01,094
and them beating you up
and giving you a black eye and shit.

1375
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:03,180
- Cheddar!
- Fuck that. Listen to me.

1376
01:34:03,663 --> 01:34:05,301
You're making history tonight.

1377
01:34:05,382 --> 01:34:07,578
Yeah, he ain't nothing. You got it!

1378
01:34:09,503 --> 01:34:10,777
You got this.

1379
01:34:22,384 --> 01:34:25,342
All right.
You know what's happening.

1380
01:34:25,424 --> 01:34:28,973
It's the championship round.
Yes, believe it's real.

1381
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:32,622
It's time. We got Papa Doc...

1382
01:34:34,464 --> 01:34:35,976
and we got B-Rabbit.

1383
01:34:37,064 --> 01:34:39,658
I don't have to stress
how important this is.

1384
01:34:40,304 --> 01:34:41,703
It's the championship.

1385
01:34:41,784 --> 01:34:44,582
This motherfucker
is what we came to see.

1386
01:34:45,703 --> 01:34:47,456
That's why the fuck we're in the D.

1387
01:34:47,543 --> 01:34:49,933
We represent. We at The Shelter.

1388
01:34:50,264 --> 01:34:52,333
It's real. I hope you're all ready.

1389
01:34:52,424 --> 01:34:55,257
This shit is about to be
crackolatin' in here.

1390
01:34:55,663 --> 01:34:57,096
Hold on.

1391
01:34:57,944 --> 01:34:59,503
Let's do the coin toss.

1392
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:03,578
As Papa Doc is defending champion,
you get to choose.

1393
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:05,418
What do you want, heads or tails?

1394
01:35:05,585 --> 01:35:06,621
Heads.

1395
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:11,575
Okay. Who goes first?

1396
01:35:12,026 --> 01:35:13,698
Let that bitch go first.

1397
01:35:16,106 --> 01:35:18,939
I can't believe my ears.
A lot of hostility.

1398
01:35:19,066 --> 01:35:20,863
Papa's got a lot of anger.

1399
01:35:20,946 --> 01:35:24,621
All right, check this out.
We got new rules.

1400
01:35:24,826 --> 01:35:28,262
Being it's the championship round,
each of these cats...

1401
01:35:29,066 --> 01:35:31,022
gets a minute and a half apiece.

1402
01:35:31,426 --> 01:35:33,018
I don't know what'll happen!

1403
01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:34,585
B-Rabbit...

1404
01:35:35,866 --> 01:35:37,265
you know what to do.

1405
01:35:37,346 --> 01:35:38,223
DJ, kick that shit.

1406
01:35:57,667 --> 01:35:59,498
Now everybody from the 313

1407
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:02,147
Put your motherfuckin' hands up
and follow me

1408
01:36:02,667 --> 01:36:06,137
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up

1409
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:07,580
Look, look

1410
01:36:08,147 --> 01:36:09,375
Now while he stands tough

1411
01:36:09,467 --> 01:36:11,741
Notice this man
did not have his hands up

1412
01:36:12,347 --> 01:36:14,383
This Free World's got you gassed up

1413
01:36:14,547 --> 01:36:16,616
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?

1414
01:36:16,906 --> 01:36:19,103
One, two, three and to the four

1415
01:36:19,188 --> 01:36:21,701
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four

1416
01:36:21,788 --> 01:36:24,018
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one

1417
01:36:24,107 --> 01:36:26,542
You're Pac, he's Pac,
you're Pac none

1418
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,018
This guy's no motherfuckin' MC

1419
01:36:29,188 --> 01:36:31,701
I know everything
he's got to say against me

1420
01:36:31,788 --> 01:36:33,857
I am white
I am a fuckin' bum

1421
01:36:34,027 --> 01:36:36,462
I do live in a trailer with my mom

1422
01:36:36,668 --> 01:36:38,704
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom

1423
01:36:38,788 --> 01:36:40,699
I do got a dumb friend
named Cheddar Bob

1424
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:43,183
Who shoots himself in his leg
with his own gun

1425
01:36:43,348 --> 01:36:46,101
I did get jumped
by all six of you chumps

1426
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:48,140
And Wink did fuck my girl

1427
01:36:48,228 --> 01:36:50,821
I'm still standing here screaming
''Fuck Tha Free World''

1428
01:36:51,268 --> 01:36:53,020
Don't ever try to judge me, dude

1429
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,338
You don't know what the fuck
I've been through

1430
01:36:55,428 --> 01:36:57,659
But I know something about you

1431
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:00,298
You went to Cranbrook
That's a private school

1432
01:37:01,028 --> 01:37:03,099
What's the matter, dawg?
You embarrassed?

1433
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:05,702
This guy's a gangsta?
His real name's Clarence

1434
01:37:05,829 --> 01:37:07,820
Clarence lives at home
with both parents

1435
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:10,423
Clarence's parents
have a real good marriage

1436
01:37:10,509 --> 01:37:12,420
This guy don't wanna battle
He's shook

1437
01:37:12,509 --> 01:37:15,228
'Cause ain't no such thing
as halfway crooks

1438
01:37:15,469 --> 01:37:16,424
He's scared to death

1439
01:37:16,509 --> 01:37:18,784
He's scared to look
in his fucking yearbook

1440
01:37:18,869 --> 01:37:20,302
Fuck Cranbrook

1441
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:23,940
Fuck a beat

1442
01:37:24,028 --> 01:37:25,098

01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:29,342
Fuck y'all if you doubt me

1446
01:37:29,429 --> 01:37:32,307
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash
I say it proudly

1447
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:35,018
Fuck this battle
I don't want to win, I'm outtie

1448
01:37:35,108 --> 01:37:37,988
Here, tell these people something
they don't know about me

1449
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:52,065
Papa Doc, what are you gonna do?

1450
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:54,467
DJ!

1451
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:57,470
A minute and a half! Spin that shit!

1452
01:37:57,950 --> 01:37:59,144
Spin that shit!

1453
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:06,148
Crook!

1454
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,545
Yo.

1455
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:40,869
We got a new champion!

1456
01:38:41,351 --> 01:38:43,467
B-Rabbit!

1457
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:48,590
Let's roll, man.

1458
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,906
Fuck Free World!!

1459
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:08,105
B-Rabbit!

1460
01:39:16,511 --> 01:39:18,069
Three One Third is in the house!

1461
01:39:18,832 --> 01:39:20,902
Don't get it twisted,
this is my man here!

1462
01:39:21,072 --> 01:39:23,381
This is my man right here.

1463
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:25,064
Where we headed, Rabbit?

1464
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:26,671
We're on our way.

1465
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:30,950
We're gonna get that big deal soon!
Then we'll get all the bitches!

1466
01:39:31,072 --> 01:39:32,390
All the bitches.

1467
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:37,105
Where are we going?

1468
01:39:37,233 --> 01:39:38,871
I'm going back to work.

1469
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:40,261
Work?

1470
01:39:41,073 --> 01:39:43,223
Get out of here.
You ain't going to work.

1471
01:39:43,913 --> 01:39:45,823
You the man now.
You ain't got to work.

1472
01:39:45,953 --> 01:39:48,308
Fuck Wink! Fuck Tha Free World!

1473
01:39:48,593 --> 01:39:50,345
We are the shit!

1474
01:39:55,233 --> 01:39:56,461
What's up?

1475
01:39:56,553 --> 01:39:57,587
Hold on.

1476
01:39:58,193 --> 01:39:59,546
Man, I've been thinking.

1477
01:40:00,913 --> 01:40:04,383
We should host the battles together,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1478
01:40:07,273 --> 01:40:09,389
No. That's you, dawg.

1479
01:40:10,633 --> 01:40:13,591
Come on. Tell me
you don't want to host with me.

1480
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:16,390
You'll have everybody
looking up to you...

1481
01:40:16,874 --> 01:40:18,511
everybody'll know who you are.

1482
01:40:20,234 --> 01:40:21,303
Yeah, but...

1483
01:40:22,953 --> 01:40:25,263
I think I need to just
do my own thing, man.

1484
01:40:28,554 --> 01:40:29,589
You know?

1485
01:40:32,594 --> 01:40:34,663
Yeah, I think I do.

1486
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,187
All right, Rabbit.

1487
01:40:53,436 --> 01:40:54,789
Peace out, Rabbit!
