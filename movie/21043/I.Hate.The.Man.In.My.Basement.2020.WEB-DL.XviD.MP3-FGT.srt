No.

Just a meeting.

Tomorrow night, though,

don't go fucking
    bailing on me this time.

It'll be good for you.

00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,870
Who knows, you might
      even like this chick.

17
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,371
Nah, probably not.

18
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,841
She's kind of hot,
        though, you know?

19
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:52,244
Hot in that kind of,
 keep her eyes open during a BJ

20
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,479
kind of way, feel me?

21
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,748
-I better get going.
           -All right.

Here.

What is that, six in a row?

24
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,291
Eight.

25
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,594
[Riley chuckling] Yeah, well,
         whatever, dick,

26
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,795
I'm coming for you next month

           of the day.

30
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,181
-Sure, no problem.
             -Okay.

31
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,550
[Tattianna] Is everything good?
          Are you okay?

Yeah.

Wasn't any help.

Said she hadn't
       seen him in months,

38
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,737
not sure she'd
       tell us if she had.

39
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,607
What about a roommate?

40
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:00,445
Girlfriend?
I mean, somebody has to have
 seen him at some point, right?

41
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,315
The problem is,
  when they've been this close
   to the bottom for so long,

42
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,851
it makes it easier
    to stay under the radar.

While we appreciate
      you wanting to help,

45
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,264
it's best you let us handle it.

46
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,867
Do what you can to move on.

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,470
Hey, I know, okay?

48
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,471
I know.

49
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,341
But you got to take it from me,

50
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,910
this shit
     will eat you up inside.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,667
you really shouldn't eat these.
      Honestly, I wouldn't
    even feed them to a dog.

156

   -Um, maybe, maybe just some

157
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,872
-Ibuprofen or--
       -Yeah, no problem.

158
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:08,974
I'll grab something.

159
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,242
Or just a ride home
         would be nice.

160
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,145
She's on your way,
    you should take her.

161
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,750
Sure, yeah, no problem.

Uh, well, we're here.

  -[Riley chuckling] All right,
           here we go.

Let's go, come on.

170
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,842
[Soria giggling]
     Ah, well that's usually
  the problem though, isn't it?

171
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,412
But I am a pretty good
       judge of character.

172
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,914
I can tell a person's appearance
    just by looking at them.

173
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,117
-That's impressive.
             -Yeah.

174
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,154
What I can't seem to tell is
 whether they're married or not.

175
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,257
The last two, oh,
   maybe three relationships?

176
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,393
All married guys.
      Can you believe that?

177
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:09,234
I don't know, maybe it's just
they're pent-up primal desires
     that I'm attracted to?

178
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,370
Or maybe I just have this scent
   that attracts married guys?

179
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,338
I don't know.

180
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,440
Is this it?

181
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,343
Oh, yeah.

182
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,414
Are you in a hurry?

183

[Soria] Oh, shit. Ah!

      we just power through

      -Okay, I'll put you--

       Oh, well, whatever.

Can we talk about
    that instructor, though?

 please stop poking me with that
thing? What is your problem?"

you're just such a sexy dancer!"

       She didn't buy it.

Oh, it was nice.

301
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,311
Super quick, though.
  Um, just in, out... [popping]
      right on her stomach.

302
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,846
-Ugh, how do you, how do you--
             -What,

303
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,448
oh, dude,
    that shit goes both ways.

304
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,883
Trust me, that's why it works.

305
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,453
I promise you,
   as far as she's concerned,

306
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,655
I was Channing fucking Tatum
        digging her out,

307
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,325
going deep, giving her
       the old Magic Mike.

308
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,194
[grunting] I don't care.

309
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,598
You know, you,
    you are like some kind of

310
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,870
poetic yet filthy savant,
         you know that?

311
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,472
Whoa, I like that.

312
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,475
Come on, ask her out.

313
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,413
-Not happening.
       -Ugh, come on dude,
        I know it's weird

314
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,215
and there's some unwritten rule,

315
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,384
but I, I got to say man,
   half the time I don't know

316
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,785
what to say or
     how to act around you.

317
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,756
In fact, what I do know
    is that I am of zero help

318
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,459
or comfort to you most
   of the time, all the time!

319
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,163
Ugh, dude, you are
       fucking miserable.

320
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,566
And she wouldn't
       want it like that.

321
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,368

Claude, right?
      Friend of the Rileys?

334
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,621
Yeah, that's me, yeah.

335
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,725
So, can I help you?

336
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,996
Yes, yeah, um, yeah,
          I, I was, um,

337
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,734
I was thinking about, um,
  getting back in to it, maybe?

338
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,270
You know, uh, just, just, uh,
    just a couple of lessons.

339
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,572
Lessons, you want salsa lessons?

340
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,976
Yeah or, um, you know
 I-- I've always been interested

341
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:49,914
in the, um, the foxtrot.

342
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,881
Foxtrot?

343
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,520
-Uh, that's a shame.
             -It is?

344
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,757
Yeah, I mean after you
    pussed out the other day

345
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,860
and did that whole duck
   and cover drive away thing?

346
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,330
I thought maybe this time
      you'd, uh, sacked up
         to ask me out.

347
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,032
[chuckling] What?

348
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:12,036
No, I didn't,

351
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:27,818
um, would you, would you like
     to have dinner with me?

352
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,592
Sometime, um,
   in the, in the near future?

353
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,661
Yeah, I would.

354
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,031
Sometime in the near future.

355
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,834
Okay.

-You got her.
-I wonder if I could talk to you
     about your son, Logan?

371
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,651
Look, I done told you,
         motherfuckers,
       I haven't seen him.

372
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,187
I'm not with the motherfuckers.

373
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,456
You're a real
       funny asshole, huh?

374
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:19,890
I just want to talk.

[ashtray rattling]

I'm sure you're not
   fucking shocked to find out

377
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:30,501
that I wasn't the most
    nurturing of mothers, hm?

-[lighter clicking]

Tough love, you know?
       It's good for kids.

380
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,044
What about the, uh, his dad?
       Is he still around?

381
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,111
You're fucking kidding, right?

382
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,881
Is this some sort
    of talk show shit?

383
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:47,785
-You're right.
     -Just line them up and
  point and, uh, there you go.

Call Maury. Congratulations,
       you are the father.

385
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,125
What about as a kid?

-What was he like?
   -What was he like as a kid?

I don't fucking know.
      He was a fucking kid!

388
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:04,535
What are you writing, uh,
  a biographical or something?

389
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,639
Hm? You, you got some
         rich guy guilt?

What are you after?

I--

I don't know.

395

What, are you lonely?

396
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,823
Because that's maybe
   something I can help with.

397
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,759
No.

398

401
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,303
You are a funny asshole.

402
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,607
You still haven't told me
   why you're looking for him.

They really, really are.

445
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,262
[Kyra laughing]
        I got the feeling

446
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:49,233
that I was the subject
 of some masturbatorial ritual.

447

-Is that a word?
         -I, I think so,
        yeah. [chuckling]

       and, uh, you were.

449
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:01,845
Oh, God, it's flattering, right?

450
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,081
I don't know, I, you know, he,

451
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,184
he masturbates to those, um,

452
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,886
to those hamburger commercials,

453
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,187
-Oh, my God.
              -so--

454
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,393
Okay.

455

-[chuckling]
 -You know, my ex was like that.

456
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,930
I used to catch him,
     like, every other day.

457
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,801
-Really?
 -Really. We used to go through
   paper towels by the dozen.

458
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,035
Always in front of a mirror.

459
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:29,840
-Fetish thing.
        -Fetish, um, the,
        the paper towels?

460
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,842
No... [chuckling] the mirrors.

461
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,244
A nightmare in fitting rooms.

462
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,046
Yikes.

463
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,082
It was cato-something-philia.

464
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,218
Married and divorced
         within a year.

465
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,956
How about you, ever married?

466
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,361
Yeah.

467
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,130
Okay and?

468
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,400
You know all about
       my pud whacking ex.

469
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,401
-[chuckling]
          -Out with it.

470
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:58,969
What, divorced?

471
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,038
Did it get ugly?

472
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,107
Oh, lesbian?

473
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,343
Come on, please
     tell me she went taco!

474
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:11,348
Yes? So, what did she go butchy
     or like TV porn pretty?

475
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,817
She passed away.

476
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,321
Um.

477
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,958
Oh, shit. Ah, shit.

478
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,794
I don't, I don't know what--
    I don't what to say, um--

479
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,165
Tell me you're joking, you--

480
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,000
You're fucking with me?

481
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,504
Oh, my God.

482
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,541
Um, how long?

483
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,877
Eight months.

484
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,845
Eight? This, uh--

485
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,315
Is, is that enough time?

486
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,286
-Oh.
   -Well, I, I don't know. Um.

487
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,988
I don't know
     if there's uh, like a,

488
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,159
you know a set, like a set
       or, or definitive.

489
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,961
No, no, no, no, okay, I'm sorry.

490
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,897
I'm sorry, I, I'm just
       really bad at this.

491
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,833
And I, and I, um...

492
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,204
Could we, could we
      just get out of here?

493
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,507
Okay, yeah, yeah, no problem.

494
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,043
No, no, no, no,
    I, I still want to hang.

495
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,547
I mean if you do. [chuckling]

496
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,515
It's just, I, I fucked this up,

497
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,984
-and, and the smell
         of this fusion.
       -[Claude laughing]

498
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,354
-And, and the lesbian
          thing, and--
     -Yeah, honestly, look,

499
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,257
um, there's, there's no way
      you could have known.

500
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,526
Okay. [chuckling]

501
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:34,064
Um, I'm sorry, you,
 you had something else planned?

502
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:37,868
Um.

503
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,238
Yeah, I, yeah.

504
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,874
-Get out of here though.
         -[bell dinging]

505
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:50,147
As a kid, when I'd get
        all messy, my dad

506
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,216
would always like lick a napkin

507
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,017
and wipe my face with it.

508
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,986
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
          And the, uh,

509
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,290
this smell of his own spit.

510
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,558
And, ugh.

511
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,128
-[laughing]
    -It must be like a...

512
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,998
A weird,
  instinctual dad thing, yeah?

513
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,333
-Hm.
             -Yeah.

Yup, that's it!

518
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,881
Thank you very much for
 helping me relive that trauma.

519

[Kyra laughing]

520
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:30,320
This date, bad food, ice cream,

521
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,189
[laughing] I feel like I'm 15
     and you're going to try

522
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,423
and feel me up at any minute.

523
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:39,663
Nah, I, I, I thought, um, a bit
of nostalgia would be fun.

524
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,499
Mm-hm. So, what's next,
    putt putt and making out

525
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,068

       the Dinosaurs ride?
        -[both laughing]

Ah, second date.

527

Hm, that's usually
    when I go for boob, too.

528
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,074
So, you're safe tonight.

529
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,175
-Hm.
             -Yeah.

530
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:03,553
Wow, that you know,
  it used to take me like hours

531
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,155
to work up
    to that kind of courage.

532
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,590
I feel so cheap.

533
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,458
-I'm sorry.
              -No.

534
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,559
Here you go.

535

Go on.

-Mm-hm.
           -That's it?

542
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,150
How was it?

543

Small little bee sting.

She was there, and...

...she's on my lap,

746
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:56,572
and all I can think
         about was her.

Yeah.

748

[chuckling] You know the, um,
 the first girl I ever got with

749
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,468
was this red-haired
    chick named Martha.

750
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:30,673
And normally I-- I am not into
  shit like that, but you know,

751
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:34,043
but Martha she was like,
           like, damn.

752
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,079
And I was like, whoa.
           [chuckling]

753
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:39,982
Skin all creamy and shit.

754
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,619
And I-- I didn't know
        what I was doing,

755
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:47,323
but you know,
  Martha she knew some things.

756
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:50,693
[chuckling]
   Yeah, she knew some things.

757
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,466
But like ever since her
     it's all been downhill.

758
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:01,103
It was like
     nobody is good enough.

You know, nobody
      has that magic touch.

760
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:08,411
So, finally I just,
     I started asking girls

761
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,146
to do things
      like Martha would do.

762
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:14,517

      to get him a present

if you were to show up with me.

Look at you.

   the golf kid and now this.

       if you came with me

Okay then.

      really like you, too.

 things he might do to himself.

started going, I didn't ask her.

I've been taking your advice.

1513
01:38:49,391 --> 01:38:50,356
Good.

1514
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,659
How's your hand?

1515
01:38:56,298 --> 01:38:57,263
Better.

1516
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,465
Hm, taking a break.

1517
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:02,669
Hitting the bag, right?

1518
01:39:04,005 --> 01:39:04,971
Right.

1519
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:07,974
Can I see it?

1520
01:39:11,212 --> 01:39:13,546
-The bag, yeah. [chuckling]
             -Yeah.

1521
01:39:14,049 --> 01:39:15,214
Follow me.

1522
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:17,517
[lock rattling]

1523
01:39:30,398 --> 01:39:31,631
No gloves.

1524
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,040
Think I could get
        a glass of water?

1525
01:39:42,577 --> 01:39:43,643
Yeah.

1526
01:39:47,515 --> 01:39:49,082
How long you two been, uh?

1527
01:39:50,085 --> 01:39:51,651
-Not long.
         -A few months.

1528
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:54,988
[Detective McGee] That's good.

1529
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,491
-Detective--
         -Can I ask you
   where you were last night?

1530
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:02,128
Yeah, we went out to
     dinner and then a film.

1531
01:40:02,564 --> 01:40:03,629
Where?

1532
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:09,202
High Misty and they were playing
  "Dirty Dancing" at the park.

1533
01:40:11,106 --> 01:40:12,238
Anyone else with you?

1534
01:40:14,242 --> 01:40:16,075
Yeah, my friends, the Rileys.

1535
01:40:16,077 --> 01:40:18,745
Mitch, what is this all about?

1536
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,481
Found Logan Kirby's
        body last night.

1537
01:40:23,084 --> 01:40:24,484
Shot twice in the chest.

1538
01:40:27,322 --> 01:40:29,622
Seems like we weren't
 the only ones looking for him.

1539
01:40:29,624 --> 01:40:31,324
[suspenseful music]

1540
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:38,398
Weird thing was, though,
     it seemed like he was,

1541
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,400
I don't know, tortured.

1542
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,137
You know anything about that?

1543
01:40:47,675 --> 01:40:48,641
No?

1544
01:40:50,512 --> 01:40:51,677
How about you?

1545
01:40:52,347 --> 01:40:53,312
No.

1546
01:40:54,682 --> 01:40:56,649
Well, all that is
         what it is now.

1547
01:40:57,318 --> 01:40:59,252
I mean, these
    types get themselves

1548
01:40:59,254 --> 01:41:00,720
into all sorts of trouble.

1549
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:09,362
But murder,
    that's a different game.

1550
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:13,099
Lord knows I'd understand,
        but I got to ask.

1551
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,136
Did you murder Logan Kirby?

1552
01:41:17,839 --> 01:41:19,572
[suspenseful music]

1553
01:41:28,516 --> 01:41:29,749
I wanted to.

1554
01:41:34,823 --> 01:41:36,322
But I couldn't do it.

1555
01:41:36,858 --> 01:41:39,292
[suspenseful music]

1556
01:41:43,131 --> 01:41:44,530
Have a good vacation.

1557
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,573
You okay?

1558
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,149
[Kyra sniffling]

1559
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:09,555
[Kyra crying]

1560
01:42:13,161 --> 01:42:15,428
[Kira trembling]

1561
01:42:17,899 --> 01:42:20,399
[dramatic music]

1562
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:57,370
[dramatic music]
