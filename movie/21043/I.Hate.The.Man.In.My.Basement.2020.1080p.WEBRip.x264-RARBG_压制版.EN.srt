{\r原文字幕}Where are you taking me to lunch?

10
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,620
{\r原文字幕}I have to head over to midtown.

11
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,850
{\r原文字幕}They find something?

12
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,550
{\r原文字幕}No.

13
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,060
{\r原文字幕}Just a meeting.

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,190
{\r原文字幕}Same shit.

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,260
{\r原文字幕}All right, all right.

16
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,590
{\r原文字幕}Tomorrow night, though,

17
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,680
{\r原文字幕}don't go fucking bailing on me this time.

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,510
{\r原文字幕}It'll be good for you.

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,070
{\r原文字幕}Who knows, you might even like this chick.

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,370
{\r原文字幕}Nah, probably not.

21
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,840
{\r原文字幕}She's kind of hot, though, you know?

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,240
{\r原文字幕}Hot in that kind of, keep her eyes open during a BJ

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,670
{\r原文字幕}kind of way, feel me?

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,940
{\r原文字幕}- I better get going. - All right.

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,980
{\r原文字幕}Here.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,320


10027
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,520
{\r原文字幕}What is that, six in a row?

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,290
{\r原文字幕}Eight.

29
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,590
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, well, whatever, dick,

30
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,790
{\r原文字幕}I'm coming for you next month

31
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,060
{\r原文字幕}and you owe me lunch.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,340
{\r原文字幕}Oh, um... I'm going to be unavailable for the rest of the day.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,180
{\r原文字幕}- Sure, no problem. - Okay.

34
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,750
{\r原文字幕}Is everything good? Are you okay?

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,980
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,890
{\r原文字幕}Finally tracked down the mother.

37
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,820
{\r原文字幕}Molly Kirby.

38
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,990
{\r原文字幕}Wasn't any help.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,270
{\r原文字幕}Said she hadn't seen him in months,

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,930
{\r原文字幕}not sure she'd tell us if she had.

41
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,800
{\r原文字幕}What about a roommate?

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,130
{\r原文字幕}Girlfriend?

43
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,550
{\r原文字幕}I mean, somebody has to have seen him at some point, right?

44
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,050
{\r原文字幕}The problem is,

45
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,510
{\r原文字幕}when they've been this close to the bottom for so long,

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,050
{\r原文字幕}it makes it easier to stay under the radar.

47
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,860
{\r原文字幕}While we appreciate you wanting to help,

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,460
{\r原文字幕}it's best you let us handle it.

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,060
{\r原文字幕}Do what you can to move on.

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,470
{\r原文字幕}Hey, I know, okay?

51
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,670
{\r原文字幕}I know.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,540
{\r原文字幕}But you got to take it from me,

53
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,620
{\r原文字幕}this shit will eat you up inside.

54
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,790
{\r原文字幕}Consume you all together if you let it.

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,840
{\r原文字幕}Didn't think people actually ate these.

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,420
{\r原文字幕}Apparently.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,130
{\r原文字幕}You know, we have an organic section now, it's--

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,350
{\r原文字幕}you really shouldn't eat these.

59
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,180
{\r原文字幕}Honestly, I wouldn't even feed them to a dog.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,570
{\r原文字幕}Not that I don't like dogs, but like, you know.

61
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,440


62
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,110
{\r原文字幕}That's nice.

63
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,360
{\r原文字幕}Good to see you!

64
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,070
{\r原文字幕}Yes, it's always good to see you, Claude.

65
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,490
{\r原文字幕}- Do you salsa? - Hi everyone, I'm Kyra!

66
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,190
{\r原文字幕}- Hi. - Welcome.

67
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,790
{\r原文字幕}- Waiting on one more? - Yes.

68
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,660
{\r原文字幕}- You must be Rylee. - Yes!

69
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,170
{\r原文字幕}Oh, Riley with an I, Y two E's.

70
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,670
{\r原文字幕}- Oops. - I know, right?

71
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,730
{\r原文字幕}This is Claude.

72
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,640
{\r原文字幕}- Hi. - Hi.

73
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,060
{\r原文字幕}So sorry I'm late you guys.

74
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,630
{\r原文字幕}One of the little bastards pissed himself,

75
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,970
{\r原文字幕}so I can't freaking even,

76
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,430
{\r原文字幕}how are you?

77
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
{\r原文字幕}- Hi! - I'm good.

78
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,600
{\r原文字幕}Huh, both of you.

79
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,820
{\r原文字幕}- Hi, delicious. - So good to see you!

80
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,620
{\r原文字幕}Good to see you, too!

81
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,040
{\r原文字幕}Soria, this is Claude.

82
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,450
{\r原文字幕}Claude, this is Soria.

83
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,750
{\r原文字幕}Claude.

84
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,960
{\r原文字幕}Rylee has told me everything,

85
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,250
{\r原文字幕}and it's just so... awful.

86
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,800
{\r原文字幕}It's terrible.

87
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,340
{\r原文字幕}So, no pressure, let's just do a little dance,

88
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,760
{\r原文字幕}have a little fun, get down tonight!

89
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,740
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah? - Okay, let's get started.

90
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,010
{\r原文字幕}No, go back I think.

91
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,650
{\r原文字幕}Okay, better.

92
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,110
{\r原文字幕}Maybe just try and feel the music,

93
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,150
{\r原文字幕}don't worry so much about the steps.

94
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,980
{\r原文字幕}Or rhythm.

95
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,220
{\r原文字幕}Not bad.

96
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,680
{\r原文字幕}Not great, either.

97
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,560
{\r原文字幕}Okay, okay, maybe let's just do a little spin.

98
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,930
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah? - Yeah.

99
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,530
{\r原文字幕}So we're going to step out

100
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,470
{\r原文字幕}and spin into our partner's arms. Okay?

101
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,280
{\r原文字幕}Nice.

102
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
{\r原文字幕}Just that easy, ready?

103
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,810
{\r原文字幕}- Yes. - Okay.

104
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,280
{\r原文字幕}Oh, oopsie, oh, sorry.

105
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,850
{\r原文字幕}And five, six, seven, eight.

106
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,650
{\r原文字幕}- Fuck! - Oh, you, ah, yeah, that's…

107
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,850
{\r原文字幕}oh, shit, shit, are you all right?

108
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,090
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, fine, fine, fine.

109
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,160
{\r原文字幕}- Are you all right? - Ah, yeah, s-- shit.

110
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,810
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I think I just, uh, she went a little fast

111
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,770
{\r原文字幕}- and I missed my count. - Yeah, get her up.

112
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,730
{\r原文字幕}- We'll get you up. - No, you guys, stop.

113
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,970
{\r原文字幕}Up, up, up, up, there we go.

114
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,780
{\r原文字幕}Okay, keep going.

115
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,990
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, God. - It's okay.

116
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,140
{\r原文字幕}Let's get you to sit down.

117
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,280
{\r原文字幕}- Okay, ah! - That looks bad.

118
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,080
{\r原文字幕}- You're so strong. - Oh, yeah.

119
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,290
{\r原文字幕}We're going to put you right here.

120
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,620
{\r原文字幕}There we go.

121
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,340
{\r原文字幕}Get it, oh, there we go.

122
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,060
{\r原文字幕}I'm fine. I'm fine you guys.

123
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,430
{\r原文字幕}I-- Can I help? Can I get you some ice or something?

124
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,030
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no, no.

125
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,550
{\r原文字幕}Thanks.

126
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,810
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

127
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,140
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, jeez. - Um, maybe, maybe just some Ibuprofen or--

128
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,940
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, no problem.

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,170
{\r原文字幕}I'll grab something.

130
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,910
{\r原文字幕}Or just a ride home would be nice.

131
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,390
{\r原文字幕}She's on your way, you should take her.

132
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,950
{\r原文字幕}Sure, yeah, no problem.

133
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,810
{\r原文字幕}Rain check?

134
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,860
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

135
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,820
{\r原文字幕}How about you two, you want to finish up?

136
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,090
{\r原文字幕}Uh, well, we're here.

137
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,490
{\r原文字幕}What do you say, Ry Ry, huh?

138
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,590
{\r原文字幕}Olé!

139
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,380
{\r原文字幕}- Here you go. - All right, here we go.

140
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,580
{\r原文字幕}Let's go, come on.

141
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,040
{\r原文字幕}Ah, well that's usually the problem though, isn't it?

142
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,560
{\r原文字幕}But I am a pretty good judge of character.

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,110
{\r原文字幕}I can tell a person's appearance just by looking at them.

144
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,310
{\r原文字幕}- That's impressive. - Yeah.

145
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,150
{\r原文字幕}What I can't seem to tell is whether they're married or not.

146
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,490
{\r原文字幕}The last two, oh, maybe three relationships?

147
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,590
{\r原文字幕}All married guys. Can you believe that?

{\r原文字幕}You know, just, uh, hustling the streets.

540
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,280
{\r原文字幕}Trying to earn that dollar.

541

{\r原文字幕}and to impress girls.

543

544
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,030
{\r原文字幕}- Is it working? - A little bit.

545
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,630
{\r原文字幕}Yeah?

546
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,100
{\r原文字幕}Good, you know, because usually,

547
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,200
{\r原文字幕}actually after I, um, after I do something like that

548
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,910
{\r原文字幕}I'm like, "yo girl, you want to freak this?"

549
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,910


550
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,070
{\r原文字幕}Freak?

551
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,110

00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,710
{\r原文字幕}Oh, yeah, hm.

553
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,310
{\r原文字幕}Hold that thought.

554
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,750
{\r原文字幕}See what you got.

555
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,580
{\r原文字幕}Mm, yeah, get in there.

556
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
{\r原文字幕}Does freaking always make you this hungry?

557
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,980
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, it's why I was so fat in high school.

558
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,280
{\r原文字幕}Huge.

559
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,760
{\r原文字幕}I'm just glad they didn't have that intervention show back then.

560
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,620
{\r原文字幕}You know, because my family would have been like,

561
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,790
{\r原文字幕}"Claude, we love you,

562
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,660
{\r原文字幕}but we're worried about your freaking.

563
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,630
{\r原文字幕}It's really gotten out of hand."

564
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,200
{\r原文字幕}Same here, but mine would have been for anal.

565
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,770
{\r原文字幕}My mom was pretty protective.

566
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,400
{\r原文字幕}No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

567
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,370
{\r原文字幕}She didn't care. Loved the butt stuff.

568
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,080
{\r原文字幕}No.

569
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,970
{\r原文字幕}Well, again, sorry about that.

570
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,410
{\r原文字幕}That's all right.

571
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,710
{\r原文字幕}Now we know why I choose restaurants and the movies.

572
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,310
{\r原文字幕}Deal.

573
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,220
{\r原文字幕}Coming in, you weirdo?

574
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,190
{\r原文字幕}I'm all out of Boone's Farm.

575
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,360
{\r原文字幕}Regular wine okay?

576
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,030
{\r原文字幕}Ha, perfect, yeah.

577
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,050
{\r原文字幕}So, how long have you had the studio for?

578
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:53,280
{\r原文字幕}I have had the studio for two years, Claude.

579
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:01,230
{\r原文字幕}And is it, um, something, you, you, always wanted?

580
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,400
{\r原文字幕}Yeah. Yeah, I always wanted to own a shitty

581
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,000
{\r原文字幕}little dance studio since I was a little girl.

582
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,830
{\r原文字幕}Life goal, complete.

583
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,580
{\r原文字幕}So, it's going well? Um, you

584
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,000
{\r原文字幕}Just stop.

585

{\r原文字幕}That's plenty. You can just.

586
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,880
{\r原文字幕}Are you okay?

587
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,820
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry.

{\r原文字幕}Oh, my God, are you, are you?

{\r原文字幕}Oh, my.

{\r原文字幕}How's the book?

592
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,980
{\r原文字幕}It's not bad now that I'm getting' used to it.

593
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,520
{\r原文字幕}It's a book that she was reading when I saw her.

594
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,260
{\r原文字幕}The book, um, the first time I saw her, she was reading it.

595
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,830
{\r原文字幕}That, that book.

596
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,240
{\r原文字幕}Well, you know, this, this is the first book that I ever read.

597
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,210
{\r原文字幕}As in like, the first time I ever read any book.

598
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
{\r原文字幕}You know, that wasn't like a kiddie book or something.

599
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,110
{\r原文字幕}It felt like I was, uh, cheating on her.

600
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,260
{\r原文字幕}She was there, and...

601
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,530
{\r原文字幕}...she's on my lap,

602
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,570
{\r原文字幕}and all I can think about was her.

603
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,240
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

604
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,930
{\r原文字幕}You know the, um, the first girl I ever got with

605
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,460
{\r原文字幕}was this red-haired chick named Martha.

606
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,670
{\r原文字幕}And normally I-- I am not into shit like that, but you know,

607
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,040
{\r原文字幕}but Martha she was like, like, damn.

608
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,070
{\r原文字幕}And I was like, whoa.

609
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,980
{\r原文字幕}Skin all creamy and shit.

610
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,610
{\r原文字幕}And I-- I didn't know what I was doing,

611
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,320
{\r原文字幕}but you know, Martha she knew some things.

612
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,690
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, she knew some things.

613
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,460
{\r原文字幕}But like ever since her it's all been downhill.

614
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,100
{\r原文字幕}It was like nobody is good enough.

615
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,040
{\r原文字幕}You know, nobody has that magic touch.

616
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,410
{\r原文字幕}So, finally I just, I started asking girls

617
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,140
{\r原文字幕}to do things like Martha would do.

618
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,650
{\r原文字幕}You know, I, I wouldn't say like,

619
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,510
{\r原文字幕}"Hey, do it like Martha's doing it."

620
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,180
{\r原文字幕}But I would like kind of instruct them.

621
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,720
{\r原文字幕}But, you know, Martha was always there,

622
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:30,190
{\r原文字幕}in my head when I was with the others.

623
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,530
{\r原文字幕}So.

624
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:11,070
{\r原文字幕}Yo, I think you got problems.

625
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,440

803
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,240
{\r原文字幕}and, technically, I don't have to get him a present

804
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,650
{\r原文字幕}if you were to show up with me.

805
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,840
{\r原文字幕}Look at you.

806

807
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,140
{\r原文字幕}and now this.

808
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,050
{\r原文字幕}And I'd really like it if you came with me

809
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:59,320
{\r原文字幕}and I got to spend another night hanging out with you.

01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:01,850
{\r原文字幕}Okay then.

811
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,760
{\r原文字幕}Damn it. I must really, really like you, too.

812
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,030
{\r原文字幕}Because I've had actual nightmares about him

813
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,190
{\r原文字幕}and the things he might do to himself.

814
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,020
{\r原文字幕}Then thank you.

815

{\r原文字幕}Peace out.

816
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:56,670

819
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,360
{\r原文字幕}- Yeah. - Nice.

820
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,310

{\r原文字幕}that you are quite the dancer.

826

{\r原文字幕}She's exaggerating.

827
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,480
{\r原文字幕}- No, I'm not. - Yeah, she is.

828
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,350
{\r原文字幕}You have moves.

829
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,090

833
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,830
{\r原文字幕}- Riley, why don't you come join me? - What?

834
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,940
{\r原文字幕}I've got two hands and we need four drinks, so.

835
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,110
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

836
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:00,900

838
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,920
{\r原文字幕}Oh, no, we're just chilling. You know, with his stuff.

839
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,220
{\r原文字幕}Oh, my god, I know. And he's like the best.

840
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,150
{\r原文字幕}Like, literally the best guy ever. Like, literally...

841
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,420
{\r原文字幕}and his wife...

842
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,530
{\r原文字幕}...so super-duper great, too.

843
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,540
{\r原文字幕}- Oh, you, you knew her? - Mm-hm.

844
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:35,810
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, we, we haven't really talked about it.

845
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,040
{\r原文字幕}I think it's too much for him.

846
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,750
{\r原文字幕}Well, I just hope they find that fucker.

847
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,280
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, what? Uh, who?

848
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,880
{\r原文字幕}The guy, you know?

849
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,490
{\r原文字幕}They haven't caught him yet.

850
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,090
{\r原文字幕}To think he's still out there.

851
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,250
{\r原文字幕}Claude is like an angel,

852
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:54,990
{\r原文字幕}because I would be out there

853
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,830
{\r原文字幕}with a gun like, seriously.

854

{\r原文字幕}Ladies.

855
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,350
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

856
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,070
{\r原文字幕}I think I spilled on myself.

857
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,310
{\r原文字幕}At least now, you know, we'll both be having nightmares.

858
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,020
{\r原文字幕}Honestly, I've never even seen them like hold hands,

859
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,280
{\r原文字幕}let alone doing whatever they were doing.

860
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,230
{\r原文字幕}- You okay? - For sure.

861
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:31,820
{\r原文字幕}Are you sure?

862
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,210
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, I just, uh,

863
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,140

864
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,870
{\r原文字幕}I am so sorry.

865
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,010
{\r原文字幕}Well, you could have just asked me.

866
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,650
{\r原文字幕}No, I didn't, she just started going, I didn't ask her.

867
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,490
{\r原文字幕}Right.

868
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:03,030
{\r原文字幕}I wanted you to know that I want to be here.

869
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:07,330
{\r原文字幕}However long it takes you,

870
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:10,200
{\r原文字幕}I want this.

871
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,400
{\r原文字幕}Yeah?

872
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,410
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

873
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,250
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

874
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,570
{\r原文字幕}Can we just, um,

875
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,510
{\r原文字幕}can we just talk about Riley for like, one more second?

876
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,650
{\r原文字幕}Please?

877
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,520
{\r原文字幕}I'm sorry, I didn't want to think about him just now.

878
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,420
{\r原文字幕}I really didn't, but it's just what he pulled back there,

879
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,590
{\r原文字幕}it's just come on.

880
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:07,290
{\r原文字幕}- Come on, drink up.  - Ah, God bless you.

881
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,990
{\r原文字幕}- You'll feel much better.  - Was it embarrassing?

{\r原文字幕}What would you have me do? I…

1016
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,730
{\r原文字幕}I didn't know what to do!

1017
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,130
{\r原文字幕}I didn't know, please.

1018
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,600
{\r原文字幕}What am I supposed to say to that, Claude?

1019
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,700
{\r原文字幕}What?

1020
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,800
{\r原文字幕}I'm supposed to be flattered?

{\r原文字幕}Kyra.

1025

{\r原文字幕}Kyra.

1026
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:26,080

1027
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,710
{\r原文字幕}- Look, I didn't say anything. - What did you say?

1028
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,310
{\r原文字幕}I swear to God, I didn't say anything to her!

{\r原文字幕}...took her from me.

1039

{\r原文字幕}You want to talk about it?

1040

{\r原文字幕}Really try to channel the artist's vision.

1045
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,720
{\r原文字幕}I think I'm going to jump off the bridge.

1046
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,020
{\r原文字幕}Capture his determination.

1047
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,290
{\r原文字幕}This was supposed to be fun.

1048
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,730
{\r原文字幕}His passion.

1049
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,990
{\r原文字幕}Why did he choose this subject?

1050
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,870
{\r原文字幕}Why are you here, right now recreating it?

1051
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,800
{\r原文字幕}Sipping wine.

1052
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,080
{\r原文字幕}- Powerful. - I thought so myself.

1053
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,350
{\r原文字幕}Are you done? Are you done?

1054
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,650
{\r原文字幕}Good. Uh, that is a

1055
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:54,140
{\r原文字幕}very interesting strategy

1056
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,450
{\r原文字幕}and considering that

1057
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:59,890
{\r原文字幕}I am absolutely confident that you are way too

1058

01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,940
{\r原文字幕}I know, I know, he's never there.

1074
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,000
{\r原文字幕}I don't know what that,

1075
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,500
{\r原文字幕}oh, that's weird, it's a check.

1076
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,560
{\r原文字幕}Did you put that in?

1077
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,600
{\r原文字幕}- No. - No, okay, that's weird.

{\r原文字幕}There's no suspense, look, this person has had a rough year.

1094
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,480
{\r原文字幕}Right, we, we can all acknowledge that. I mean,

1095
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,550
{\r原文字幕}he's been through some things

1096
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,550
{\r原文字幕}that we can't even imagine, and...

1097
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,060
{\r原文字幕}...the thing is he, he persevered, you know?

1098
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:45,960
{\r原文字幕}And he showed up every single day and he kicked some ass,

1099
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,400
{\r原文字幕}and that's-- that deserves some applause.

{\r原文字幕}Great job.

1118
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:48,070
{\r原文字幕}Who would have thought it'd take something like this

1119
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:49,120
{\r原文字幕}for me to get clean, huh?

1120
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:57,230
{\r原文字幕}I can't even remember the last time.

1121
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,320
{\r原文字幕}I needed money, I wanted--

1122
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,660
{\r原文字幕}I wanted money.

1123
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,030
{\r原文字幕}To score.

1124
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,230
{\r原文字幕}It was-- It was getting pretty bad.

1125
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,700
{\r原文字幕}We were, we were supposed to be in and out.

1126
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,220
{\r原文字幕}And I saw her standing there

1127
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,070
{\r原文字幕}off to the side.

1128
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:39,070
{\r原文字幕}She didn't look scared, or nothing.

1129
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,150
{\r原文字幕}She had nice stuff.

1130
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,320
{\r原文字幕}You know, big bag, big rings.

1131
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,090
{\r原文字幕}So I walked over to her.

1132
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,030
{\r原文字幕}She was real pretty.

1133
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:03,300
{\r原文字幕}I snatched her bag and I say, "Give me the fucking rings."

1134
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,100
{\r原文字幕}She wouldn't do it.

1135
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,270
{\r原文字幕}She wouldn't do it, she--

1136
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,680
{\r原文字幕}It just made me mad.

1137
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:17,710
{\r原文字幕}She made me real fucking mad, man, so I said,

1138
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,480
{\r原文字幕}"Give me the fucking rings,"

1139
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,550
{\r原文字幕}and I'm pointing my gun in her face.

1140
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:29,360
{\r原文字幕}I was just trying to scare her, man.

1141
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,730
{\r原文字幕}I swear to God I was just trying to fucking scare her.

1142
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,800
{\r原文字幕}Fuck.

1143
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,240
{\r原文字幕}Hey, well, fuck it, you know.

1144
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:52,180
{\r原文字幕}There are no, there are no excuses.

1145
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,220
{\r原文字幕}Do what you got to do, man.

1146
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,860
{\r原文字幕}I get it.

1147
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,830
{\r原文字幕}Do what you got to do.

1148
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,900
{\r原文字幕}I'm just going to take some time.

1149
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,500
{\r原文字幕}Maybe use those tickets.

1150
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,440
{\r原文字幕}-Good. - There's just a--

1151
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:25,710
{\r原文字幕}a few things I've been pushing off for a little too long.

1152
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:26,260
{\r原文字幕}You're right, well,

1155
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,250
{\r原文字幕}And you know what, maybe even a bigger one.

1156
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,220
{\r原文字幕}I appreciate that.

1157
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,860
{\r原文字幕}Next time not next to the shitter.

1158

{\r原文字幕}Okay. We're still going to chill, right?

1164

{\r原文字幕}She's clean, she drives pretty well, she's a little banged up,

1170
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,970
{\r原文字幕}but, uh, you want to take her for a test drive?

1171
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,880
{\r原文字幕}Hey, look at you!

1172
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,780
{\r原文字幕}I'm so proud.

1173
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:42,990
{\r原文字幕}Thank you.

1174
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,570
{\r原文字幕}I need you to listen to me.

1175
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,680
{\r原文字幕}As far as I know, you died in that basement.

1176
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:34,270
{\r原文字幕}Thank you for...

1177
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:37,810
{\r原文字幕}...not calling anyone.

1178
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,310
{\r原文字幕}I didn't know how to...

1179
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:45,980
{\r原文字幕}...tell you,

1180
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:54,670
{\r原文字幕}that I-I-I had my...

1181
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,860
{\r原文字幕}wife's...

1182
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:01,130
{\r原文字幕}...murderer.

1183
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:08,300
{\r原文字幕}You know, or what you'd think of me if I did.

1184
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,840
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, tough one.

1185
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,280
{\r原文字幕}I thought about calling.

1186
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,250
{\r原文字幕}You, not the police or anything.

1187
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,650
{\r原文字幕}That's not true, I almost called.

1188
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,860
{\r原文字幕}It's hard to digest.

1189
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:33,030
{\r原文字幕}I mean I tried to understand it.

1190
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,730
{\r原文字幕}And then I just think that you're an insane person.

1191
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,670
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1192
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,140
{\r原文字幕}Been there.

1193
01:34:56,450 --> 01:34:57,420
{\r原文字幕}And?

1194
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,720
{\r原文字幕}He's gone.

1195
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,030
{\r原文字幕}I-I-I let him go.

1196
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,870
{\r原文字幕}The Rileys came in for another lesson.

1197
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,140
{\r原文字幕}Got in a fight and left.

1198
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:22,580
{\r原文字幕}I mean, they bought

1199
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,460
{\r原文字幕}like a dozen lessons, so.

1200
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,350
{\r原文字幕}I think she might get--

1201
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:30,720
{\r原文字幕}I got these tickets and stuff to Hawaii.

1202
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,720
{\r原文字幕}I won them at work.

1203
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:41,000
{\r原文字幕}It's seven days, and massages, the whole works.

1204
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:45,500
{\r原文字幕}Fish, scuba.

1205
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:51,370
{\r原文字幕}I'm thinking about going next week.

1206
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,380
{\r原文字幕}Next week?

1207
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,150
{\r原文字幕}I've never been to Hawaii.

1208
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,390
{\r原文字幕}Me neither.

1209
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:09,860
{\r原文字幕}- Sounds nice. - Yeah.

1210
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,300
{\r原文字幕}Are you-- are you asking me to go to Hawaii with you?

1211
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,370
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1212
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:33,010
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1213
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:35,320
{\r原文字幕}Okay?

1214
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,820
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1215
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,470
{\r原文字幕}-They match. - Absolutely not.

1216
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:54,570
{\r原文字幕}- What? - No, no.

1217
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:56,470
{\r原文字幕}-It's Hawaii. - Don't be that guy.

1218
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,110
{\r原文字幕}What, should I pack my grass skirt?

1219
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,020
{\r原文字幕}Point taken.

1220
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,640
{\r原文字幕}Okay, you know, if you did have

1221
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,980
{\r原文字幕}a coconut bra, though,

1222
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,980


1223
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:05,850
{\r原文字幕}I think I'd be interested in that.

1224
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:06,850
{\r原文字幕}Oh, yeah?

1225
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:08,280
{\r原文字幕}Hm, no room.

1226
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:10,080
{\r原文字幕}It was that or the edible panties.

1227
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,890
{\r原文字幕}Good choice, because I get hungry on planes.

1228
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,210
{\r原文字幕}I get swamp ass.

1229
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:18,830
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, we're going to beeline straight for the water, then.

1230
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:18,830


1231
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,260
{\r原文字幕}- Okay. - Yeah.

1232
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:23,260
{\r原文字幕}Oh, hey, do you have any of those, um...

1233
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,290
{\r原文字幕}...masky tubey things?

1234
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:26,970
{\r原文字幕}Masky tubey things? Snorkels?

1235
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:29,170
{\r原文字幕}- Snorkels, yes! - Yeah, I think I got, um--

1236
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:32,570
{\r原文字幕}- Get new ones? - Let's get new ones.

1237
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,980
{\r原文字幕}- Mm-hm. - Yeah, okay, cool.

1238
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,410
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, new ones. Okay.

1239
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:37,150
{\r原文字幕}Let's get out of here, ready?

1240
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,350
{\r原文字幕}- You ready? - Yes.

1241
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,620
{\r原文字幕}Okay.

1242
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:47,360
{\r原文字幕}Morning.

1243
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:49,990
{\r原文字幕}Good morning.

1244
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:51,290
{\r原文字幕}I, uh...

1245
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:57,030
{\r原文字幕}Going on a trip?

1246
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:58,970
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1247
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,370
{\r原文字幕}Uh, Hawaii.

1248
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:05,070
{\r原文字幕}Uh, Detective McGee, this is, this is Kyra.

1249
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:08,480
{\r原文字幕}Uh, Kyra this is, um, Detective McGee.

1250
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:11,250
{\r原文字幕}He's handling, uh, uh, the case.

1251
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:12,950
{\r原文字幕}Hi, nice to meet you.

1252
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:16,020
{\r原文字幕}You got a minute?

1253
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,490
{\r原文字幕}Okay, sure, yeah.

1254
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:21,460
{\r原文字幕}Please.

1255
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,170
{\r原文字幕}How you been?

1256
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:38,470
{\r原文字幕}Fine.

1257
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,180
{\r原文字幕}Never called.

1258
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,380
{\r原文字幕}I've been taking your advice.

1259
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:50,350
{\r原文字幕}Good.

1260
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,650
{\r原文字幕}How's your hand?

1261
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:57,260
{\r原文字幕}Better.

1262
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,460
{\r原文字幕}Hm, taking a break.

1263
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:02,660
{\r原文字幕}Hitting the bag, right?

1264
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,970
{\r原文字幕}Right.

1265
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,970
{\r原文字幕}Can I see it?

1266
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:13,540
{\r原文字幕}The bag, yeah. Yeah.

1267
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,210
{\r原文字幕}Follow me.

1268
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:31,630
{\r原文字幕}No gloves.

1269
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,040
{\r原文字幕}Think I could get a glass of water?

1270
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:43,640
{\r原文字幕}Yeah.

1271
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:49,080
{\r原文字幕}How long you two been, uh?

1272
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,650
{\r原文字幕}- Not long. - A few months.

1273
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:54,980
{\r原文字幕}That's good.

1274
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:58,490
{\r原文字幕}- Detective-- - Can I ask you where you were last night?

1275
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:02,540
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, we went out to dinner and then a film.

1276
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,620
{\r原文字幕}Where?

1277
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:09,200
{\r原文字幕}High Misty and they were playing "Dirty Dancing" at the park.

1278
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:09,200


1279
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,230
{\r原文字幕}Anyone else with you?

1280
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,070
{\r原文字幕}Yeah, my friends, the Rileys.

1281
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:18,740
{\r原文字幕}Mitch, what is this all about?

1282
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,480
{\r原文字幕}Found Logan Kirby's body last night.

1283
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,480
{\r原文字幕}Shot twice in the chest.

1284
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,230
{\r原文字幕}Seems like we weren't the only ones looking for him.

1285
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:38,390
{\r原文字幕}Weird thing was, though, it seemed like he was,

1286
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,400
{\r原文字幕}I don't know, tortured.

1287
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,130
{\r原文字幕}You know anything about that?

1288
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:48,640
{\r原文字幕}No?

1289
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:51,670
{\r原文字幕}How about you?

1290
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:53,310
{\r原文字幕}No.

1291
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:56,640
{\r原文字幕}Well, all that is what it is now.

1292
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:59,800
{\r原文字幕}I mean, these types get themselves

1293
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,470
{\r原文字幕}into all sorts of trouble.

1294
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:09,360
{\r原文字幕}But murder, that's a different game.

1295
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,090
{\r原文字幕}Lord knows I'd understand, but I got to ask.

1296
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,130
{\r原文字幕}Did you murder Logan Kirby?

1297
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:29,740
{\r原文字幕}I wanted to.

1298
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:36,320
{\r原文字幕}But I couldn't do it.

1299
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:44,530
{\r原文字幕}Have a good vacation.

1300
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,570
{\r原文字幕}You okay?
