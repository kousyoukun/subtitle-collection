1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,368
SUDDEN RAIN

2
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,701
"Winter Cooking: 15 Hot-Pot
Recipes"

3
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,474
Whats for dinner?

4
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,460
I haven't decided yet.

5
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:32,019
Cook me something good, wont you?

6
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:39,361
Almost forgot my medicine.

7
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:56,877
Lets go for a walk, but maybe
it's a bit late.

8
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:59,460
We can still go to Tamagawa or
Inogashira.

9
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:01,673
Still behaving like a child at
your age.

10
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:03,809
That’s not too bad.

11
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,675
How much money do you have?

12
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:12,554
It's like this every Sunday,
what a drag.

13
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:17,317
16, 17, 18, 19

14
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:25,145
If were going, we should start
getting ready after dinner.

15
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:30,381
Yes. But first we must decide
where to.

16
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,348
How about visiting Mr. Kawakami?

17
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,704
Come on.

18
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:52,138
No.

19
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:01,319
Stop this! I heard you.

20
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:07,155
I see him everyday in the office.

21
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:12,203
It's not so bad staying home on
a Sunday.

22
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:16,217
I really don’t know what I'm
doing here.

23
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:17,872
Whats wrong?

24
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:23,338
Nothing.
I just don’t understand you.

25
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:27,739
Well what is it?

26
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:32,910
You just to whatever I'm doing.

27
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:40,859
I pick up a newspaper, and you
start knitting.

28
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,022
I sigh, and you sigh.

29
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:49,314
I yawn, and you yawn.

30
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:53,685
That's why I suggested going out,
but you're always against it.

31
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:58,918
We didn't get married to go out.

32
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:05,266
It's not so bad staying home on
Sundays, to enjoy family life.

33
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,656
That explains why you never say
anything.

34
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,678
Whats there to say?

35
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,850
People make conversation for it's own sake,

36
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,863
not because they have or
don't have things to say.

37
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:20,620
So you want to talk philosophy!
Okay, people make conversation.

38
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,125
But you hardly start one yourself.

39
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,871
Because you always say I'm
nagging you.

40
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,792
Because you talk when I reading
the paper.

41
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,080
Also when you are sleeping.

42
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,164
I was tired.

43
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:53,590
Please only cut out the cooking section
after I've done with the newspaper.

44
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,917
I'm afraid I've forget...
and I thought you've finished.

45
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:00,919
But you don't use the recipes.

46
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:04,989
They all cost too much.

47
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,436
Green beans are 35 yen a jar.

48
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:15,824
And a piece of salmon costs 15 yen.

49
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:20,518
Where are you off to?

50
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,563
Be right back.

51
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:25,867
Is that so?

52
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,776
I'm not going to Kawakami's.

53
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,443
It doesn't matter if you do.

54
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,624
Are you mad?

55
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:42,344
Whats going on?

56
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,543
Now I understand.

57
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,370
Understand what?

58
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,602
I’m sorry.

59
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,870
How strange.

60
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,467
Post this letter for me on your way.

61
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,890
So Ayako's gone on her honeymoon.

62
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,041
I suppose she and her husband are taking
a walk in Kyoto right now.

63
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,743
Now is the time.

64
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:14,694
Men should leave early and come
home late.

65
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:19,560
But other women like their husbands
to stay out.

66
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:23,393
Strange. But now I understand.

67
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:37,126
Lets move this.

68
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,790
Hey, give me a hand.

69
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,966
It's rather heavy.

70
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:25,722
Welcome.
Take a look at our toasters.

71
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,977
How much is this?

72
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,070
Cheap. Only 1,500 yen.

73
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,304
What about blenders?

74
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,874
We also have a big selection.

75
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,718
They're very good for mixing salad
dressing or bean paste.

76
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,704
A great help to patients and
old people.

77
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,346
And also people with stomach
problems.

78
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,631
Yes, do come in.
I'll give you a discount.

79
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,289
But it must cost over ten thousand yen.

80
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,551
There're less expensive models.

81
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,084
But no, thank you.
Come by another time.

82
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:27,373
Excuse me.
Is this household at home?

83
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,794
The missus maybe somewhere
in the neighborhood

84
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,517
The one who just went out with
a green basket.

85
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:36,338
The one who just went out with
a green basket.

86
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,056
Thank you.

87
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:54,319
Ayako,
why did you come back alone?

88
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,561
I got your postcard yesterday.

89
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:56,392
Oh yes?

90
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,105
I was waiting for you.

91
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,957
But you said you’d be gone for
a week.

92
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,909
I got back early.
Let me open the door for you.

93
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,170
I'll just come in through the
kitchen.

94
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,367
You just came back from your honeymoon
come in through the door.

95
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,278
No, that wont be necessary.

96
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,928
It's a mess. Please be careful.

97
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,069
Where did you go?

98
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,221
A dog.

99
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:44,875
A tramp. You feed him once and
he becomes a regular.

100
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,960
Well of course.

101
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,234
Still better than a human being.

102
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:57,909
You must be tired.

103
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:07,069
Sit down, and stop laughing.

104
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:17,206
What happened?

105
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:24,470
I'll tell you later. Wheres uncle?

106
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,658
Gone out.

107
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,014
I thought you always go out
on Sunday.

108
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:40,347
I suggested it.
But the old thing wouldn’t go.

109
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,764
So what happened?

110
00:11:51,930 --> 00:12:00,493
I'll never understand if you just
keep on crying.

111
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,836
So what did he do?

112
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,655
I’m sorry. I didn't want to cry.

113
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:14,533
I didn’t want to mention it.
But it's really too much.

114
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:19,321
I’m going home. It's so disgusting.

115
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,461
What is so disgusting?

116
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:21,584
Everything.

117
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,765
Anybody home?

118
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,578
My name is Imasato. I’m your
new neighbor

119
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,681
How do you do?

120
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:01,839
Here're some coupons from the
noodle shop. Please accept them.

121
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,722
You’re too kind.

122
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,099
Sorry to have troubled you.

123
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,059
Goodbye.

124
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,888
Let's get back to our conversation.
You had a fight, didn’t you?

125
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:25,114
It's much worse. I don't think it's working.

126
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:32,082
It took you three years of marriage
to learn this?

127
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:34,534
But it's really too much.

128
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:35,812
What happened before all this?

129
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,809
I said he didn't have any manners.

130
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:39,907
Is that it?

131
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:45,274
It's not just manners, other things too.

132
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,342
Disgusting.

133
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:49,584
Men are all like this.

134
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:57,198
He yawned in front of my mother
when he visited me at home.

135
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,759
Mother was furious.

136
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,281
But compared to all the other things...

137
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,127
Yawning was nothing.

138
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,197
But that’s something biological,
isn't it?

139
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,110
No, it has to do with love.

140
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:18,653
The moment he gets on the train, he
puts up his legs and falls asleep.

141
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:22,897
He didn’t say anything?
Like asking if you're tired?

142
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:27,918
Never. I don’t know why we
went on a trip.

143
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:31,146
He sleeps with his mouth wide open,
and wont cover it with a handkerchief.

144
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,032
Maybe the wedding was too tiring.

145
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:40,431
I was wearing that stupid wig and
heavy belt.

146
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,365
But you’re a woman.

147
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:47,173
Auntie really. Coming from you.

148
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:50,327
But...

149
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:58,616
And he flirted with the waitress
at the hotel.

150
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:04,889
I was really embarrassed
And the language he used.

151
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:10,314
"Are you from Tokyo?
You look swell in country clothes."

152
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:15,978
And the waitress said,
"And you, are you also from Tokyo?"

153
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:23,263
Tickling and teasing him,
a horrendous sight.

154
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:26,406
Disgusting. Isn’t it?

155
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:34,776
Men say different things to
different people.

156
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,773
Is uncle the same?

157
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,057
Pretty much.

158
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:43,598
No, not uncle.

159
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:51,392
What he said later was
even more outrageous.

160
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,997
I asked him where Kawa County was.

161
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:58,068
And he said make a guess. Auntie,
do you know where it is?

162
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:05,294
I said it's in Mie, and he started
laughing.

163
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:10,246
Whats so funny about it?
He was making fun of me!

164
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:16,290
Then he asked me to draw a map,
and point it out to him.

165
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:23,577
I said I hated being examined like
a high school pupil.

166
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:29,195
And he brought out pencil and
paper and made me do it.

167
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:35,229
He was such a pain. So I started
drawing one, from memory.

168
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,123
Could you?

169
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,826
He said it looked like a cucumber,
before I even finished.

170
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,526
He said it looked like a cucumber.

171
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,852
That’s too rude.

172
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,750
Why did I marry such a man?

173
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,610
A brute who knows nothing about tenderness...

174
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:05,023
I brought some local products for you.

175
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,668
Thank you. Are you hungry?

176
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,538
No, thank you.

177
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,882
We have coupons from the noodle shop.

178
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:15,258
No, I don’t want any.

179
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:16,597
They are a present.

180
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:21,133
It's alright. I'll get some noodles.

181
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,024
The drug store outside has just
installed a pay phone.

182
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:26,204
I'll be back soon.

183
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,032
Anybody home?

184
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:58,973
Excuse me.

185
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:04,075
I ordered noodles, but got udon
by mistake.

186
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,594
That’s alright. Come on, eat.

187
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:17,938
Your judgments are perhaps
premature. In fact men...

188
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,427
I’ve had enough of your advice.

189
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:24,067
Who actually decides what men
are like?

190
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,134
It seems that auntie's been tamed.

191
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:31,212
It's not that I can't stand up
for myself.

192
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:35,986
It's just that I never thought it
was a big problem.

193
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:41,031
He asked you to draw a map, but that
doesn’t mean he didn't love you.

194
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:45,808
There're even harder things to
explain between husband and wife.

195
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:51,432
Older people and younger people
have different ways.

196
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,540
Be loved or not be loved, and that’s
secondary?

197
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:58,436
What?

198
00:18:58,962 --> 00:18:59,984
The most important question is...

199
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:01,129
Is me.

200
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,890
Is whether I feel happy.

201
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:10,248
Eat, before it turns cold.

202
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:16,488
You’re too happy; you won't understand.

203
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:25,219
Since that’s the case, I'll tell you
everything.

204
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,328
I cant stand it any more.
it's going to shock you.

205
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:36,743
Calm down. Certain things are
better left unsaid.

206
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:46,486
Once they come out there’s no return.
So think about it.

207
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:49,553
I only want to know the facts.

208
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,807
You make it really hard for me
to speak my mind.

209
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:53,376
Better not say it.

210
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,384
But if I don’t,
people will never understand.

211
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:59,290
Anyway, they’re not problems
that can be solved.

212
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:00,902
Are they that kind of problems?

213
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,191
Yes.

214
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,993
Welcome.

215
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:23,303
How're you?

216
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:28,407
Luckily I didn't send out the postcard.

217
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:29,905
I did.

218
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,427
Fool.

219
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:36,550
Men are like this; they are never wrong.

220
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:40,745
I’m hungry.

221
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,819
Have you had lunch?

222
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:46,319
No.

223
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:51,266
Udon or noodles?
A present from our neighbor

224
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,115
She's really nice. Please.

225
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:18,105
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

226
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:26,380
The shoes were lined up like this.

227
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:31,678
A child in the neighborhood saw your
stray dog carrying a shoe in It's mouth.

228
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:36,013
So I thought I might find it here.

229
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,356
I’m terribly sorry.
I´ll look for it right away.

230
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:49,974
My husbands favorite shoe,
custom-made.

231
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:52,575
I am sorry.

232
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:58,419
Earlier, the childrens toys.

233
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:03,506
And Celluloid were all damaged.

234
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:06,751
That dog is not registered, is it?

235
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:11,601
But that’s not our dog.

236
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,595
Maybe you should put him to sleep.

237
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,291
I'll think of something.

238
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:23,019
You don’t have children, you can't
understand.

239
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:27,957
Children can get rabies if they’re
bitten.

240
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,392
Then it’ll be too late.

241
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:33,558
Id do my best.

242
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:38,220
If you want to keep a dog, you have
to go through all the procedures.

243
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,152
Don’t make trouble to one.

244
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,130
I am terribly sorry.

245
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,080
Excuse me, uncle.

246
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,107
What nonsense.

247
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:57,479
Give me a hand when you’ve
finished eating.

248
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:01,153
Sundays are a pain.

249
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:04,746
Auntie deals with these things
everyday.

250
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,936
That’s woman’s work.

251
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:11,212
A man has to find somebody’s
shoe on a Sunday?

252
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:12,708
Forget it.

253
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:14,424
That’s outrageous.

254
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,064
But this is our family’s business.

255
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:21,416
Never mind out business. Lets
hear yours.

256
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:27,132
Precisely, what is most important?

257
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:32,679
What is the most tedious, the most
unbearable?

258
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:36,183
I was going to keep quiet.

259
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,609
But since you don’t understand,
I may as well say it...

260
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:44,637
Last night,
he met a friend at the hotel.

261
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,526
Someone hes never mentioned before.

262
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:51,950
They started drinking from late
afternoon.

263
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:56,312
They got drunk and were making
all these noises.

264
00:23:57,008 --> 00:24:02,213
I didn’t want to disturb other people,
and asked them to be considerate.

265
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:12,777
And I got scolding.
Then the two of them went out.

266
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:20,323
I waited and waited, and he only
came back in the morning.

267
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:36,582
Bring me my medicine. And then?

268
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:44,525
I was silent for a while. Then I said
I wanted to go back to Tokyo.

269
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,612
He asked me if I was angry.

270
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,108
I said I wanted to go back to Tokyo.

271
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:53,829
Please let me leave first.

272
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,399
He said then we should leave together.

273
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:04,365
But he made the point that he was
leaving for my sake.

274
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,357
He seemed so righteous.

275
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,677
But even if he had apologized,
I wouldn’t have accepted it.

276
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,060
And if fact he was justifying himself
making excuses.

277
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,898
So I asked him if he was ashamed.

278
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:20,502
What did he say?

279
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:28,089
"I’ve done nothing wrong. You just
go ahead and suspect me".

280
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:32,846
I wasn’t suspecting him of anything.

281
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,250
But what he did made me feel
insulted.

282
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,690
And he had shamed himself.

283
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:42,869
Of course I wasn’t that clear at
that time.

284
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:48,704
I was so broken-hearted, I couldn’t
say a word.

285
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:54,295
Is that everything?

286
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:57,753
How do you feel?

287
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,904
A bit rough.

288
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:08,097
Must be more than just a bit.
Then what did he say?

289
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:15,611
Not a word until we got into
Tokyo station.

290
00:26:16,753 --> 00:26:19,952
Then just "I’m going home" and
we left each other.

291
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:26,103
If sister is still alive,
shell surely ask you to come back.

292
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:29,424
Ayako, men are...

293
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,634
No more advice, please.

294
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:33,871
Why?

295
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:37,565
I was going to and he refused.

296
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:42,296
You cant understand men like this.

297
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:46,223
If you have an opinion, tell me.

298
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:50,908
Just don’t be too serious.

299
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:56,271
You have to look behind the surface
evidence and understand his motives.

300
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,777
But...

301
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:15,092
Listen to me.,
let me try to explain for him.

302
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:22,632
He met a friend, and was surely
teased for getting married.

303
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,466
And surely he was embarrassed

304
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:32,292
And he was afraid of being called
a henpecked husband.

305
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:34,826
Afraid of what?

306
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:38,708
Listen to me.
The other guy would say.

307
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:43,858
He was dying to spend the night
with his wife.

308
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:49,101
That guy was really annoying.

309
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:53,256
So he decided to show him how
free and easy he was.

310
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:57,838
And had dinner and a few drinks
with him.

311
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:03,532
So that he wouldn’t say I´mm only
interested in my wife.

312
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,974
You...

313
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:14,139
And he believed that his intelligent
wife would understand.

314
00:28:15,017 --> 00:28:19,809
But that guy was really too much.

315
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,374
He wouldn’t let him go home,
and made fun of him being lonely.

316
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:31,511
It was only in the morning that
he managed to get away.

317
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:35,931
As he suspected,
his wife had cried her eyes out.

318
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:40,993
If he was [illegible], he’d sweet-talk
his wife.

319
00:28:41,624 --> 00:28:44,470
To make her happy.

320
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,240
That’s quite enough.

321
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:57,184
But in such situations,
all Japanese men could do is traverse.

322
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:08,418
That’s quite a speech. I've listened
enough.

323
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,789
Ayako, right?

324
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:20,544
It's just a small misunderstanding.

325
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:25,547
The important thing is to make up.

326
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,487
It's not as simple as that.

327
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,952
To insult a woman to save his face.

328
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:37,447
I absolutely cannot tolerate
such behavior.

329
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:43,838
Marriage means seeing your partner
in a new light.

330
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:47,075
Which also means discovering
each others shortcomings.

331
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:50,471
But that’s only my experience.

332
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,778
It's the same with men.

333
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:59,585
You only find out the truth about
your partner after?.

334
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,998
In other words, disillusionment.

335
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,343
But women are usually more giving.

336
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:08,398
How so?

337
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,708
They always bend themselves backwards
for men.

338
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:15,897
On the surface, naturally.

339
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:20,088
They even make sacrifices.

340
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,222
Like what?

341
00:30:24,303 --> 00:30:28,264
Like giving up ones own interest
for the husband's.

342
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,183
Are we talking about music?

343
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:34,616
Not only music.

344
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:37,023
Oh, that.

345
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,371
What? What is that?

346
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,349
How could you bring this up before
other people?

347
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,940
That’s history.

348
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,529
You cant criticize me.

349
00:30:58,352 --> 00:31:01,587
Ayako is here.
Will you behave yourself.

350
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:31,408
He spent his honeymoon sleeping
in the train.

351
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,527
Who?

352
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:41,375
He left Ayako alone;
and he slept with his mouth open.

353
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,904
An ugly nose hes got.

354
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,938
And ill-mannered too.

355
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:52,018
He flirted with the waitress right
in front of Ayako.

356
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:56,070
His table manners are dreadful.

357
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:01,793
That’s not the worst.

358
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,979
The worst is he simply wasn’t
interested in anything.

359
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,544
I suggested sightseeing,
and he said he was tired.

360
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:17,849
I suggested food,
and he complained about the taste.

361
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,294
Maybe he has stomach problems.

362
00:32:21,121 --> 00:32:27,902
And lazy too.
He combs his hair with his fingers.

363
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:36,672
And bossy too, a show-off.

364
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:44,059
He asked Ayako to draw a map
of Japan.

365
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,163
Before she finished,
he said it looked like an eggplant.

366
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:51,223
Auntie, It's cucumber.

367
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,834
Yes. He said cucumber.

368
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:56,224
Is that so.

369
00:32:56,706 --> 00:33:03,064
What a drag.
How're they going to go on?

370
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:10,422
Well what do you think? Should
they separate?

371
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:16,068
What would you do if it was you?

372
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,690
I think I've made a mistake in
talking to you.

373
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,095
I should have made my very own
decision.

374
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:30,251
But I was afraid you’d disapprove if
I didn't listen to your advice.

375
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,453
So I told you everything.

376
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,850
It's been a very rewarding day.

377
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,593
Ma’am, it raining.

378
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:52,917
Thank you.

379
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,060
I’m sorry.

380
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,594
Let me do it myself.

381
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:16,510
Nenkichi, what're you doing?
The luggage is still outside.

382
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,882
Excuse me.

383
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,690
Sorry to trouble you.

384
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:40,783
Good morning.

385
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:42,315
Good morning.

386
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:50,930
The weather forecast has been
remarkably accurate lately.

387
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:57,769
Don’t bank on it.
It was supposed to rain last night.

388
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:01,383
Galoshes depress me.

389
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:05,007
True. They don’t look like shoes.

390
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:06,978
It’d
closer to the station.

391
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:08,576
Yes.

392
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:33,415
What kind of toothpaste do you use?
Before I used Silver.

393
00:35:33,894 --> 00:35:34,656
After marriage I used Diamond.

394
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,023
I’m exactly the opposite.
Your wife changed to Diamond?

395
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,792
I forgot when we changed.

396
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,315
Your wife’s very young.

397
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,955
I really shouldn’t have married
a young wife.

398
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:53,091
I have to take care of here all the time.

399
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,614
Better someone dependable,
someone I can rely on.

400
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:58,660
But shes so healthy and so
naturally beautiful.

401
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,521
Stop kidding.

402
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:03,695
Yours wife’s so gentle. You're a
lucky man.

403
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:06,910
Stop kidding.
We’ve been married four years.

404
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:12,980
We’ve just come to know each
other very well.

405
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:16,270
You don’t say.

406
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:23,275
For a start she gets up earlier
than her husband.

407
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,841
That, of course.

408
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,911
She never brings an umbrella to the
station when it rains.

409
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:36,279
And says she knows It's going to
rain when I get home.

410
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:42,575
You spoil her because shes adorable.

411
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:44,268
You think so?

412
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:50,469
Hot waters ready.

413
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:53,926
Hot water! Excellent!

414
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:56,492
I'll wash my face.

415
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:06,047
Good morning.

416
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:07,852
Good morning.

417
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,586
Feeding the dog?

418
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:21,402
I just leave it here and hell come.

419
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:32,949
Whose dog is it? It's damaged again.

420
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,147
I’m sorry.

421
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:37,070
Yours?

422
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:43,503
I’m really sorry.

423
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:46,050
That’s okay.
In any case, hats are out of fashion.

424
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:46,821
But...

425
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,837
The dog is not guilty.

426
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:56,693
Whats up? Are you still not ready?

427
00:37:57,657 --> 00:38:00,761
Sorry. Good morning.

428
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,924
Good morning. Please hurry.

429
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:32,238
Stay in line. You can go on your
own when we get to the park.

430
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,144
Show some spirit.

431
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:41,910
Going on a hike?

432
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:47,036
Too Oak Tree Hill. I’m already
exhausted.

433
00:38:48,397 --> 00:38:50,544
Kiiko. How nice!

434
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:52,836
They have monkeys there.

435
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:54,751
Really?

436
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:58,743
Thank you for the present.

437
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:00,077
Don’t mention it.

438
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,049
Going shopping?

439
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:02,838
Yes, to the train station.

440
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:04,119
See you.

441
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:05,689
See you.

442
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:15,830
That was Mrs. Amayama.
Shes been sick for quite some time.

443
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:17,340
She looks quite young.

444
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:22,991
It's the medicine.
it's turned her hair white.

445
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:31,673
The butcher shop was okay.

446
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:36,968
But they weren’t that friendly if
you didn't buy a lot.

447
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,016
50 yen is just too much for two persons.

448
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,846
They bragged about their customers
who own Alsatians.

449
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:49,623
And gave us the third degree because
we only spend 20 or 30 yens.

450
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,697
I’ve decided never to set foot in
that shop again.

451
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:54,309
It's just too much.

452
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,616
The one behind the train station
is better.

453
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,880
Behind the train
station is better.

454
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,921
Kenkichi can pick some up on
his way home.

455
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,946
Your husband is brilliant.

456
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:12,410
But he looks so dumb, he drives
me nuts.

457
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,550
I searched everywhere to look
for your shoe...

458
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:26,445
If it isn't in the house, you'll never
find it.

459
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:32,888
I’m sorry. This is Imasato,
our new neighbor

460
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,436
The one in the promotion business.

461
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,472
Pleased to meet you.

462
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:43,826
I myself teach flower arrangement.
Pleased to meet you.

463
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,284
My name is [illegible].

464
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,729
This is Mrs. [illegible],
a big shot at the company.

465
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:50,200
Oh please...

466
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,758
This is a good film.

467
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:57,117
There’s a discount coupon in the
newspaper, let's see it.

468
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:58,735
It's very touching.

469
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:01,800
That’s how I felt.

470
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:07,229
It could have happened in real life.

471
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:12,050
You just cant depend on your
children these days.

472
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:16,784
All the toil and work to bring up
a child, why bother?

473
00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:21,420
The children leave home,
the husband cheats on her, poor woman.

474
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,307
That Mr. Amayama seems to be
having an affair.

475
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:27,210
Was that her?

476
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:35,376
It's so terrible when a woman gets sick,
and she has to bear children.

477
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:38,165
[illegible]

478
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,749
She cant. There're side effects...
I´mm going to get some threads.

479
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,393
I have to pick up some vegetables
for lunch.

480
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,726
I have to go get cotton balls.

481
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:48,984
Goodbye.

482
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,018
Goodbye.

483
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:15,059
Here you are. You’re really early
today. This morning...

484
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:18,590
The guy next to us forgets his pass.

485
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:20,572
Here you are.

486
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:21,728
Sorry to keep you waiting.

487
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,988
That’s alright.

488
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:26,169
It's great to be home early.

489
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:28,779
It's good enough to be home on time.

490
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:31,515
You’re getting a big bonus,
aren't you?

491
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:35,110
To fight for our New Year stipend,
we have to wait.

492
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:38,932
If we go on like this, the company
will fold.

493
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:41,189
You’re kidding.

494
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:42,944
I’m serious.

495
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,250
Your wife showed me this shop
this morning.

496
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:47,787
Really?

497
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:50,712
I’m going the other way.

498
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:56,580
Do you like movies?

499
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,332
I used to go to the cinema
every week.

500
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,235
You like foreign movies,
don't you?

501
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:05,432
It's terrible here. The smell from
the toilet ruins everything.

502
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,677
You’re home. For once you're
early and you have to complain.

503
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:36,658
You should have told me.
Here're the keys.

504
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,864
I’ve made an appointment with
your husband.

505
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:43,560
To see a movie on Sunday.
It's all settled.

506
00:43:48,345 --> 00:43:49,663
Open up!

507
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:19,876
You’re so bad.

508
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:23,887
You should be glad when other
people are happy.

509
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:31,385
From now I’m not going to
take you anywhere.

510
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:38,248
Sorry. I just cant help it.

511
00:44:39,602 --> 00:44:41,985
A question of the lack of simplicity.

512
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:48,610
If you’re not going, tell them quickly.

513
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:53,155
I don't even have a clean pair of socks.

514
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:57,112
I told you they're not dry. Size 22.

515
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,841
Herringbone.
They don't last very long.

516
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:03,065
I don’t get it.

517
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:07,865
Hurry. The third shop before the
train station.

518
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:14,974
They’re so keen on having us.
it's hard to decline now.

519
00:45:15,815 --> 00:45:17,623
Why don’t you go by yourself.

520
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:21,987
I don’t want to twist your arm,
that'll upset you.

521
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:27,108
You have to do something about your
personality.

522
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:36,471
I was never interested in going out.

523
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:42,873
My sister and I would have a date
to go see Sumo wrestling.

524
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:46,978
And I would take out the kimono
and still didn’t want to go.

525
00:46:04,122 --> 00:46:08,703
I suddenly have an headache.
I don’t know what to do.

526
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:12,508
Lets call it off.

527
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:16,824
If Mr. Namiki doesn’t mind,
why don't you go.

528
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:20,779
Since your husband is also not going...

529
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,317
What a Sunday. What a drag.

530
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,853
You go by yourself.

531
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:29,240
It's alright.
I´mm fine one way or another.

532
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:33,743
Sorry to trouble you. He doesn’t
understand, he just complains.

533
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,129
In that case, I’m going.

534
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:36,306
Don’t be too late.

535
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,319
I’m so glad.

536
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,212
Such fine weather.

537
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:44,093
Such fine weather.

538
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:45,398
Excuse me.

539
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:56,637
Missus... I'll bring back some
local products.

540
00:46:57,622 --> 00:46:58,902
Don’t be in a hurry.

541
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:13,625
They are made of the Chinese Parasol
of Aizu, where they come from.

542
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:17,908
With real clog tracks. Please take
a look.

543
00:47:18,898 --> 00:47:26,392
There're more than 10 tracks on a clog
and only 120 yen a pair.

544
00:47:27,273 --> 00:47:32,958
A real bargain.
Please take a good look.

545
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,852
Real quality clogs, well worth
the price.

546
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:41,199
And now only 200 yen for two pairs.

547
00:47:42,715 --> 00:47:48,613
290 yen for three pairs.

548
00:47:57,092 --> 00:48:01,776
The clog shop over there will cost
you more than 300 yen a pair.

549
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:02,987
I'll take that pair, please.

550
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:04,479
Thank you.

551
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:25,832
A hot bath is nice.

552
00:48:27,453 --> 00:48:30,478
The ox spleen from day before
yesterday has gone bad.

553
00:48:32,475 --> 00:48:34,155
Are you upset?

554
00:48:37,672 --> 00:48:38,843
Forget it.

555
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:43,436
I didn’t get drunk that last time
I was with you.

556
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:47,700
It's not that bad to go with you
once in a while.

557
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:52,969
How understanding you are.
I’m sorry for yesterday.

558
00:48:54,857 --> 00:48:57,950
I had a good dream last night.

559
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:02,961
The happiest dream in my life.

560
00:49:04,246 --> 00:49:08,898
I dream I was a millionaire.

561
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,049
Did you get your traveling
allowance yet?

562
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:17,372
I spent it all yesterday.

563
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:19,735
Really?

564
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:24,469
Two three thousand yen they don’t
last very long. Where're...?

565
00:49:25,123 --> 00:49:26,912
I forgot this morning.

566
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,478
You forgot. That’s swell.

567
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:34,134
All the ugliness, all the sorrow.

568
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:36,950
I really forgot.

569
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:43,908
And today’s rice.
I almost broke my gullet.

570
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,908
It could also be good exercise for
my stomach...

571
00:49:52,248 --> 00:49:55,223
You fool. It's not working because
you don't dream.

572
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,231
Dreams are fun, you know.

573
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:00,505
But...

574
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:08,912
In last nights dream, a 16
or 17-year-old.

575
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:14,718
Walks into a big forest. She is
not frightened,

576
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:20,086
...only sad. Suddenly, she is overcome
by the thought of suicide.

577
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,999
Listen, when she is about to
kill herself...

578
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:25,575
Who?

579
00:50:26,692 --> 00:50:29,737
Lets drop it.
I was just in the middle of it.

580
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:36,075
And then? There got to be people
flying in dreams.

581
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,970
You really don’t have a poets
sensitivity.

582
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:43,668
I was just going to hang myself...

583
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:48,544
I’m not going out today.
Where're my socks?

584
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:55,080
All of a sudden,
a teenage girl touched me.

585
00:50:56,641 --> 00:51:00,569
A really familiar face.
She asked me what I was doing.

586
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:06,000
I said I was making a swing,
and she gave me her belt.

587
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:08,349
What a drag.

588
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,936
The two of us were swinging...

589
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:16,037
Her hair caressed my face...

590
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:26,554
Finish it tonight. I’m late.

591
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,191
Guess who she is.

592
00:51:31,176 --> 00:51:33,981
Yesterday I...

593
00:51:35,016 --> 00:51:37,320
That young girl...

594
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:39,574
Whoever she is.

595
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:40,852
Looks like you.

596
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,006
Really?

597
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:44,154
How can you be so calm.

598
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,933
Someone picked my wallet yesterday.

599
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:51,827
Where?
How much money did you have?

600
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,237
Good morning.

601
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:14,171
Thank you for inviting my wife
to dinner.

602
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,811
The dog. It belong to that family,
doesn’t it?

603
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:32,252
We lost a short-legged chicken
recently.

604
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,188
Were sure the dog had it.

605
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:36,462
We keep chickens to educate
our children.

606
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:39,206
That’s really too much.

607
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:48,182
Excuse me.

608
00:53:32,862 --> 00:53:37,129
Mimi main store. Yes.

609
00:53:40,781 --> 00:53:43,647
Yes. I understand.

610
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,137
Fujita, come over here.

611
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:58,352
I've just been refused an advance.

612
00:53:58,850 --> 00:53:59,572
Is that so?

613
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:02,491
The old man is coming in from the
countryside. Bad news.

614
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,816
A pickpocket got my wife’s wallet.

615
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:09,334
Really, this woman.

616
00:54:10,722 --> 00:54:15,569
Were having meeting at 11:45.

617
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:24,940
Everybody please be present and
on time.

618
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:30,093
What is it?

619
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:33,040
Can't be any good.

620
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:43,306
For the purpose of expansion,
the Tsukijirushi Company...

621
00:54:43,936 --> 00:54:48,180
...will deploy one third of it's
staff here.

622
00:54:48,982 --> 00:54:50,675
What does it mean?

623
00:54:51,309 --> 00:54:52,736
Dismissal.

624
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:58,972
Please listen carefully. As the sales
department is particularly important.

625
00:54:59,648 --> 00:55:07,756
The company is therefore sending
four employees over.

626
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:15,915
And hoping four employees here will
resign.

627
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:23,771
On top of a severance pay, the company
will contribute another 100.000 yen.

628
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:31,898
If no one resigns,
the company will make the decision.

629
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:39,018
The bonus, however, will be withdrawn.

630
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:44,677
Please consider the offer carefully.

631
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,180
In other words, it mean laying off.

632
00:55:51,852 --> 00:55:52,935
Just as I expected.

633
00:55:53,382 --> 00:55:54,784
100.000 yen.

634
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,689
Four from the sales department.

635
00:55:58,335 --> 00:56:01,196
Five years. How much severance
pay does it worth?

636
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:04,554
It's more than 5 years.

637
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:22,848
I win!

638
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:24,229
Take!

639
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,006
Running a lucky streak.

640
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,447
Winning back what your wife lost,
aren’t you?

641
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,652
Not yet...

642
00:56:41,717 --> 00:56:44,820
100.000 yen bonus.

643
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:47,787
100.000 yen!

644
00:56:55,131 --> 00:56:56,900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

645
00:56:57,486 --> 00:56:58,834
Lets eat.

646
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:01,190
Yes.

647
00:57:01,939 --> 00:57:04,377
Is Mr. Namiki not eating?

648
00:57:04,894 --> 00:57:05,713
His stomach is not well.

649
00:57:06,081 --> 00:57:06,899
Really?

650
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:17,228
I know a very good doctor.

651
00:57:54,443 --> 00:57:55,729
Roast yam!

652
00:57:57,363 --> 00:57:58,637
How're you?

653
00:57:59,616 --> 00:58:00,696
It's 20 yen.

654
00:58:01,287 --> 00:58:04,776
Thank you. It's freezing.

655
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:14,549
Good morning.

656
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:16,182
Good morning.

657
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,147
Good morning, Ma’am.

658
00:59:35,147 --> 00:59:36,438
Good morning.

659
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,611
Your husband just called.

660
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:45,549
He asked you to come to the
roof of the Shiraki building.

661
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,424
Shiraki.

662
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:49,565
He's waiting for you there.

663
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:51,165
The roof...

664
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,175
Excuse me.

665
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:56,126
Thank you for your trouble.

666
00:59:56,566 --> 00:59:59,143
Have your husband gone to work?

667
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:03,197
It's early.

668
01:00:11,247 --> 01:00:15,919
From here those expensive cars
look insignificant.

669
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:24,115
Supposedly there’s a big safe
inside the Nihon Bank.

670
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:28,186
Standing here,
everything look like junk.

671
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:31,821
Do you come here often?

672
01:00:32,371 --> 01:00:34,329
I often come on the roof.

673
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:36,939
I rarely...

674
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:38,880
What a coincidence.

675
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:49,238
Where do you work?

676
01:00:49,935 --> 01:00:53,132
The sales department of Mimi
cosmetics.

677
01:00:53,802 --> 01:00:57,194
Expensive stuff.
I believe your wife will know.

678
01:00:57,857 --> 01:01:00,257
A good business.

679
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:08,075
Just getting by, two meals and
a roof.

680
01:01:09,256 --> 01:01:11,903
What about foreign literature?

681
01:01:13,975 --> 01:01:16,217
We also ship to Thailand and India.

682
01:01:16,848 --> 01:01:19,624
Foreign languages also come in
handy.

683
01:01:26,087 --> 01:01:27,949
Are you looking at my shoes?

684
01:01:28,555 --> 01:01:33,975
That’s okay.
No shame in wearing broken shoes.

685
01:01:34,912 --> 01:01:38,450
Of course. But before you wouldn’t
even explain.

686
01:01:40,146 --> 01:01:41,909
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

687
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:43,539
Did you get everything?

688
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:49,830
Someone is bringing them to the car.
Your wife’s still not here?

689
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,506
We were planning to eat together...

690
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,960
I was just saying my stomach isn’t
feeling too good...

691
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:02,497
Something light wont do any harm.

692
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:04,671
Welcome everybody.

693
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:10,534
Mr. Kato of High School 1.

694
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:25,417
Please go to refreshment on the
third floor.

695
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:41,528
The clock stopped;
and I didn’t sleep very well last night.

696
01:02:43,285 --> 01:02:46,981
Eveything's wrong since I lost
my wallet.

697
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:51,057
You fool. The company is in trouble.

698
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,574
You'll get your money back from
mah-jong.

699
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:01,697
It looks really bad.

700
01:03:04,387 --> 01:03:06,450
Whats the problem?

701
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:08,416
Are you hungry?

702
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:12,573
I can't eat anything
maybe some red bean soup.

703
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:14,509
Red bean soup.

704
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:17,746
Welcome.

705
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:22,733
What can I get you?

706
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:23,839
Soup.

707
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:27,057
Soup. Soup and soda.

708
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:28,316
Yes.

709
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:33,585
That was your old friend?

710
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:39,200
Inherited the family business;
he's got it good.

711
01:03:40,427 --> 01:03:43,268
I could be as good if I went back
to my village.

712
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:53,225
I hate people who look down
on others.

713
01:03:54,276 --> 01:03:55,824
It's rather embarrassing.

714
01:03:56,858 --> 01:03:59,184
Are you going back to your village?

715
01:03:59,498 --> 01:04:04,993
Just to have a look, then I'll decide.

716
01:04:06,136 --> 01:04:08,666
The old man's no longer young.

717
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:13,745
Treat your stomach to an x-ray.

718
01:04:16,373 --> 01:04:18,184
Sorry to keep you waiting.

719
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:30,534
Severance pay and bonus,
altogether 200,000 yen.

720
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:35,051
Spend it on your children's education,
retire to your village.

721
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:41,417
No more worries about making a living.
But you don't like village life?

722
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:48,330
It's good for your health.

723
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:56,235
Sticky rice and crowded trains.

724
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,526
What a life!

725
01:05:00,149 --> 01:05:02,167
Sticky rice?

726
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:07,008
Bread is also bad for the stomach.

727
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:10,172
So is mah-jong.

728
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:16,585
Don't be so careless.
Do you have enough presents?

729
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,074
Mrs. Namiki.

730
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:38,650
How´re you?

731
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:44,341
The principal of the kindergarten
said you ordered it.

732
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:46,707
He insisted on leaving it here.

733
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:49,712
And he said he´s done everything
he could to bring it back to life.

734
01:05:50,378 --> 01:05:51,086
Really?

735
01:05:51,665 --> 01:05:53,754
Please take over quickly.

736
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:57,369
How much?

737
01:05:58,139 --> 01:05:59,856
500 yen.

738
01:06:00,419 --> 01:06:03,866
Annual production is 369 eggs.

739
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:07,246
For an hour he repeated the same
thing over and over again.

740
01:06:07,845 --> 01:06:09,657
I´m truly sorry.

741
01:06:10,442 --> 01:06:14,054
And say I should be careful living
in the neighborhood.

742
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:15,754
Sorry.

743
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,626
And said both master and mistress
of the house are unfriendly.

744
01:06:19,157 --> 01:06:22,741
That they pretend not to see you
when you meet them on the street.

745
01:06:24,755 --> 01:06:28,488
I go out when I hear the bell of
roast yam at night.

746
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:31,651
I only had them once.

747
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:35,120
I only have cheap bean curd...

748
01:06:35,812 --> 01:06:40,629
My husband has stomach problems.
Bean curd!

749
01:06:41,008 --> 01:06:41,860
Yes.

750
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:44,860
What´s his business.

751
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,449
Really.

752
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:58,699
The problem with the stomach
is not just food.

753
01:06:59,285 --> 01:07:02,059
It´s a nervous disorder, an urban
ailment.

754
01:07:02,755 --> 01:07:05,695
A friend of mine has removed 2/3
of his stomach.

755
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:10,638
Another has removed 3/4.

756
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:16,501
They say they feel better this way.
Why don´t you do the same?

757
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:20,438
I´m thinking about it.

758
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,675
If I were single I´d have something
to do.

759
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,352
Single won´t do.

760
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:38,854
My professor has retired and is
devoting himself to writing.

761
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:45,877
He´s looking for someone to run errands,
no special knowledge required.

762
01:07:46,657 --> 01:07:52,092
The hours are 9 to 4, lunch is provided;
and he pays 9,000 yen a month.

763
01:07:52,564 --> 01:07:53,898
Comparable to a clerical position.

764
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:54,899
He´s looking for a man.

765
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:56,279
No, a woman.

766
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,858
Oh, a woman.

767
01:07:58,299 --> 01:08:02,039
I thought your wife might...

768
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:03,769
Did my wife ask you to look for
a job for her?

769
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,572
It´s not that. I was just thinking...

770
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:07,392
That won´t be necessary.

771
01:08:08,659 --> 01:08:10,740
Have an operation...

772
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:14,224
That´s my stomach.

773
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,292
You´re back.

774
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:30,402
Who is it?

775
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:33,920
You´re back.

776
01:08:34,274 --> 01:08:35,393
We´ve been waiting
for you.

777
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:36,947
What is it?

778
01:08:37,482 --> 01:08:40,676
Kawakami has something to discuss
with you.

779
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:46,575
This is my neighbor Komori.
He´s a painter.

780
01:08:46,951 --> 01:08:48,175
How do you do?

781
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,077
Come over here.

782
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:55,258
Please go ahead.

783
01:09:01,214 --> 01:09:02,370
A chicken?

784
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:04,719
The kindergarten chicken.

785
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:05,813
What?

786
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:11,255
It was bitten by the stray dog
yesterday, it just died.

787
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,849
The meat will be rough.

788
01:09:14,312 --> 01:09:16,392
The kindergarten chicken.

789
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,358
I forgot to get eggs, and wine too.

790
01:09:19,605 --> 01:09:20,690
Money?

791
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:26,817
Pardon me.

792
01:09:27,126 --> 01:09:28,746
What did the doctor say?

793
01:09:28,746 --> 01:09:32,480
Remove it, make things simple.

794
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:36,222
So you´ll delay your trip back to
the village.

795
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,506
I have more pressing business.

796
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:42,505
About what?

797
01:09:42,827 --> 01:09:44,930
I have a good idea.

798
01:09:48,419 --> 01:09:51,388
Did you get my chicken?

799
01:09:52,347 --> 01:09:57,917
My husband just came back.
I still don´t have money.

800
01:09:59,179 --> 01:10:03,529
You can pay me later.

801
01:10:04,058 --> 01:10:08,606
To promote understanding among
neighbors.

802
01:10:08,926 --> 01:10:11,635
I´m inviting everybody to attend
a meeting.

803
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:17,158
Please come to the kindergarten
at 7:30 this evening.

804
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:20,590
It´s not against you.

805
01:10:21,038 --> 01:10:24,379
Better talk about things in the
open than behind people´s back.

806
01:10:24,379 --> 01:10:29,024
We can discuss and make improvements.

807
01:10:29,736 --> 01:10:34,649
It´s all for the good of the neighborhood.

808
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,186
Remember, 7:30.

809
01:10:47,632 --> 01:10:49,059
Please.

810
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,541
A frugal meal.

811
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:09,493
This chicken has laid too many eggs.

812
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:15,935
It´s not bad if you really taste it.

813
01:11:21,941 --> 01:11:23,940
Opening a yakitori shop?

814
01:11:24,509 --> 01:11:28,779
Listen to me.
Komori is good with deep fry.

815
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:32,851
He can do Java or Sumitra deep fry.

816
01:11:33,509 --> 01:11:35,625
I can do the decoration.

817
01:11:36,173 --> 01:11:38,157
A fashionable cafe or a bar is
more profitable.

818
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:39,569
So?

819
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:46,519
In other words, the four of us, our
total pension fund comes to 1 million yen.

820
01:11:47,815 --> 01:11:49,125
That I know.

821
01:11:49,897 --> 01:11:52,897
It´ll be a waste not to start a business.

822
01:11:53,413 --> 01:11:54,157
That I understand.

823
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,154
Jintaro has started a business.

824
01:11:56,775 --> 01:12:00,273
What people call a merger is in
fact sharing the debts.

825
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:04,066
And people come fighting for it.

826
01:12:04,874 --> 01:12:07,039
It´s always like this.

827
01:12:08,013 --> 01:12:10,348
So they moved to the wooden
factories in Wakayama.

828
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:11,732
A most fitting burial ground.

829
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:14,772
Mimi´s cleansing lotion is not
too good.

830
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:17,299
There´re always new products.

831
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:19,268
What are ours plans?

832
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:20,128
Yes.

833
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,235
What should we do?

834
01:12:21,914 --> 01:12:24,907
Fashionable and elegant...

835
01:12:28,198 --> 01:12:30,646
Just like Mrs. Namiki.

836
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:32,850
What?

837
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:37,067
Different from an ordinary bar.

838
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:39,408
It should have the feeling of
Mrs. Namiki.

839
01:12:39,963 --> 01:12:41,007
Lively but emotionally fragile.

840
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:43,269
Exactly.

841
01:12:45,255 --> 01:12:47,156
Stop kidding.

842
01:12:47,915 --> 01:12:50,933
Don´t egg him on.
He´ll think he´s some big shot.

843
01:12:51,886 --> 01:12:56,316
You are the bartender, be more
generous.

844
01:12:57,395 --> 01:12:58,617
No.

845
01:13:00,011 --> 01:13:03,392
He´s not important; if you´re in it.

846
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:06,587
About sharing profit's,
that we can discuss later.

847
01:13:07,254 --> 01:13:11,219
Both Tada and I have jobs,
so this is only a side-line.

848
01:13:12,092 --> 01:13:15,257
Your stomach is not well.

849
01:13:16,011 --> 01:13:18,430
You should first make you wife
a uniform.

850
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:21,009
Uniforms are very important.

851
01:13:21,612 --> 01:13:22,788
Western style is better.

852
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:25,174
Contemporary Japanese is fine.

853
01:13:25,817 --> 01:13:32,087
Mrs. Namiki, are you interested?

854
01:13:37,137 --> 01:13:39,864
Could be very hard for just
one person.

855
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:42,571
But there must be a home atmosphere...

856
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:47,536
Everything has to be proper.

857
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:55,630
Two persons take charge of the cooking,
and we´ll hire an assistant.

858
01:13:56,387 --> 01:13:59,602
Mrs. Namiki will take care of the
customers...

859
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,048
Whose idea is it anyway?

860
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:04,946
Ours. We really worked on it.

861
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,197
And we found someone willing
to loan us the capital.

862
01:14:07,918 --> 01:14:10,310
We can decide on the amount after
talking to Mrs. Namiki.

863
01:14:11,018 --> 01:14:12,413
What?

864
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,745
Time´s changed. Men are now useless.

865
01:14:20,392 --> 01:14:23,010
That´s not true.

866
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:25,955
It´s a woman´s world.

867
01:14:26,642 --> 01:14:30,850
You have to use yours looks.

868
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:36,109
It´s hard to make a living.
You can´t close yourself up.

869
01:14:39,077 --> 01:14:40,053
Is that so?

870
01:14:40,957 --> 01:14:42,236
Shut up!

871
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:47,570
What is it? It´s all out of good will.

872
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:50,781
For your health´s sake...

873
01:14:51,352 --> 01:14:53,232
That won´t be necessary.

874
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:00,231
Sorry to have disturbed you.

875
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:05,390
I´m going out for a while.
Please enjoy the meal.

876
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:06,745
Thank you.

877
01:15:13,962 --> 01:15:16,596
Everyone´s waiting for you.

878
01:15:17,823 --> 01:15:19,220
I´m sorry.

879
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:24,598
What meeting? A war has just started.

880
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:29,827
My wife said someone was going to
use it to run an election campaign.

881
01:15:31,012 --> 01:15:37,006
Dogs are smarter than people.
But they need training.

882
01:15:43,559 --> 01:15:46,529
Please sit down.
I´ve invited her along.

883
01:15:47,264 --> 01:15:49,305
Sorry I´m late.

884
01:15:51,962 --> 01:15:57,473
Please express your opinions in
this meeting.

885
01:15:58,155 --> 01:16:03,318
So we can make improvements.
We´re just talking about dogs.

886
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:08,054
There´s a 20 yen fee,
but we´ll collect that later.

887
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:11,994
Who was talking?

888
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:14,494
I was. I think dogs must be leashed.

889
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:29,059
You´re walking down the street in the evening
and a dog jumps at you out of nowhere.

890
01:16:29,778 --> 01:16:36,308
Mrs. Taneda, you don´t put your Alsatian
on leash, do you?

891
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:41,553
For safety, also for exercise.

892
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:47,189
But people can get hurt.

893
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:57,088
My little Mary is also afraid of
dogs in the evening.

894
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:01,737
He´s really noisy.

895
01:17:04,616 --> 01:17:09,789
He wakes up my children all
the time.

896
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:14,296
But your children and their friends.

897
01:17:15,112 --> 01:17:17,846
Are always making all this noise
outside my study.

898
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:21,390
I just can´t write.

899
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:23,269
Really? I´ll teach them.

900
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:32,479
So the problem is children?

901
01:17:33,071 --> 01:17:34,381
No, it´s dogs.

902
01:17:35,473 --> 01:17:42,553
Let me bring up an even more
important issue.

903
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:48,798
On a rainy day, when you turn into the
little streets here from the main road.

904
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:53,043
It´s really troublesome.

905
01:17:54,122 --> 01:17:58,815
That we have to talk to the
landowner or the government.

906
01:17:59,621 --> 01:18:03,978
Also, please set up a time table
for piano practice.

907
01:18:03,978 --> 01:18:06,249
It´s always the same tune.

908
01:18:06,913 --> 01:18:09,735
Are you talking about my Chieko?

909
01:18:10,527 --> 01:18:16,070
You talk about noise,
and I´ll talk about smell.

910
01:18:16,828 --> 01:18:22,544
I can smell it from my sitting room
when you fertilize your garden.

911
01:18:23,348 --> 01:18:25,733
Can you use odorless fertilizer?

912
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:30,402
Everybody,
let me get the issues in order.

913
01:18:31,246 --> 01:18:33,667
The issue is dogs.

914
01:18:41,191 --> 01:18:48,072
The chicken always dig out
the seeds.

915
01:18:49,003 --> 01:18:53,311
The principal´s chicken always
dirty my walls.

916
01:18:54,215 --> 01:18:55,422
Really?

917
01:18:57,665 --> 01:19:02,677
Also,
who said my wife wears her clothes

918
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:08,375
like wearing a hat on a finger?

919
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:19,542
She was really upset about it,
and instructed me bring this up.

920
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:23,182
A hat on a finger.

921
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:33,710
I´ve been criticized for not
greeting others...

922
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:38,920
That´s just because I was thinking.

923
01:19:51,613 --> 01:19:54,328
Don´t let these things upset you.

924
01:19:54,939 --> 01:19:57,834
We´ve come to no conclusions
whatsoever.

925
01:19:58,649 --> 01:20:04,627
In any case,
dogs and chickens must be unleash.

926
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:08,426
I have to go first.

927
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,695
Good night.

928
01:20:27,231 --> 01:20:28,313
Good night.

929
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:42,584
Is everybody gone?

930
01:20:43,289 --> 01:20:44,670
I threw them out.

931
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:48,480
What happened?

932
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,237
What is it?

933
01:20:56,132 --> 01:20:59,574
They were talking about such things,
and you didn´t do anything.

934
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:02,326
What things?

935
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:06,586
You fool. The yakitori shop.

936
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:10,259
I think that's rather amusing.

937
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:12,861
How?

938
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:15,557
Well isn´t it?

939
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:19,467
People look down on us.

940
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:24,225
You have a problem. Why can´t
I work?

941
01:21:24,852 --> 01:21:25,952
Why don´t you let me work?

942
01:21:32,746 --> 01:21:37,350
A working wife makes her husband
lose face?

943
01:21:38,084 --> 01:21:39,915
What nonsense!

944
01:21:42,214 --> 01:21:45,309
I don´t want my wife to support me.

945
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:51,569
Who´s supporting you?
I only want each of us to make money-

946
01:21:52,293 --> 01:21:57,995
You´re still providing the meals.
We spend what we earn.

947
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:03,353
Are you serious?

948
01:22:33,591 --> 01:22:35,911
Come here. I have to talk to you.

949
01:23:19,376 --> 01:23:24,698
I haven´t had lunch.
I´m so hungry I could cry.

950
01:23:29,512 --> 01:23:31,478
What a drag.

951
01:23:51,248 --> 01:23:54,579
Do you know what I want to
talk about?

952
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,432
What?

953
01:23:58,724 --> 01:24:02,507
I thought you were ignoring me.

954
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,392
Why are you so angry?

955
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:11,867
You can do what you please.

956
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:17,135
I´m going back to the village
to farm.

957
01:24:21,286 --> 01:24:25,340
You´re not used to life in the
country, better stay here.

958
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:32,376
Good. I see what you mean, you...

959
01:24:33,262 --> 01:24:34,582
It´s too much trouble.

960
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:40,775
Listen.
You always say you´re going back.

961
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:44,911
But your younger brother is already
there, farming.

962
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:53,978
You can´t just go back and eat
even if you´re the eldest son.

963
01:24:54,937 --> 01:24:59,997
Is 100,000 yen really that important?

964
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:05,217
You´ve become a mouse for a little
money. How dreadful.

965
01:25:06,312 --> 01:25:07,032
Mouse?

966
01:25:10,678 --> 01:25:13,282
If you make 5,000 yen a month
it´ll just take you two years.

967
01:25:13,995 --> 01:25:16,727
10,000 yen a month and it´s even
less than a year.

968
01:25:17,377 --> 01:25:20,519
Even I can do that.

969
01:25:22,023 --> 01:25:26,169
In that case, it´s alright to separate.

970
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:30,819
Well, do you want to separate?

971
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,863
I see no other way.

972
01:25:34,759 --> 01:25:39,184
I thought I was having a serious
discussion with you.

973
01:25:40,196 --> 01:25:44,585
You´re so feudal,
no wonder Ayako is mad at you.

974
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:50,501
You think everything will be there
for you in the village.

975
01:25:51,303 --> 01:25:54,628
You ruin your stomach and you´ve
become a coward.

976
01:27:30,055 --> 01:27:34,248
"My husband took this picture.
We are fine."

977
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:39,158
"Don´t worry about me. Will visit
you later."

978
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,560
"Ayako."

979
01:28:26,913 --> 01:28:29,066
Uncle, balloons.

980
01:28:47,325 --> 01:28:50,894
Okay?... Oh...

981
01:29:19,227 --> 01:29:20,342
Get hold of it.

982
01:29:21,554 --> 01:29:22,986
Damn it.

983
01:29:23,652 --> 01:29:24,962
Harder.

984
01:29:25,544 --> 01:29:26,635
That´s it.

985
01:29:27,941 --> 01:29:29,909
Keep going.

986
01:29:33,623 --> 01:29:36,848
Damn... not yet.

987
01:29:38,103 --> 01:29:39,947
They were fighting last night.

988
01:29:40,557 --> 01:29:42,944
Just look at them!
