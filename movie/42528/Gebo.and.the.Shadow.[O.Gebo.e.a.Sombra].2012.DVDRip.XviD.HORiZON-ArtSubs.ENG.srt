1
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,205
GEBO AND THE SHADOW
based on the play by

2
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,723
Adapted and directed by

3
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,568
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!

4
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,011
Poor old man, he'll be freezing.

5
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,688
It's been raining all day.

6
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,722
A lifetime of bad weather.

7
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,489
It's difficult to see anything out there.

8
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,240
Mother, could you give us
a bit more light?

9
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,486
Ah! His old rug and slippers!
Or he'll complain...

10
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,124
It's been so many years!

11
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,923
- Father's late. Could he have taken ill?
- He'll be chatting with the neighbours.

12
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,849
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

13
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,450
Call me when he arrives!
He'll have news today.

14
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,561
News from who?

15
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,086
From Joéo, your husband, my son.

16
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,004
You're always the same!

17
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,802
Don't forget the old rug
and the shoes...

18
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,811
On the chair. I've got them,
didn't you see?

19
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,687
Everything's ready.

20
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,450
Except the books.
He doesn't like us touching them.

21
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,522
Good.

22
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,889
It's already so dark!

23
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,563
Always this illusion!

24
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,284
We can't even weep...
so that she can keep her illusion.

25
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:13,609
She gets on with life, forgets, while
we spend hours mulling, fretting...

26
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,440
That's his voice, his footsteps.

27
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,246
He's coughing.
He's talking to someone.

28
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,122
Mother, he's here!

29
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,961
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

30
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,804
Who's he talking to?

31
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,449
Father's coming!

32
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,409
He's knocking.

33
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,401
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

34
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,400
How he talks!

35
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,041
I'm coming...

36
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,485
- Come in. No need to knock.
- "Ladies... "

37
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,609
I didn't know, Doroteia.
Won't you come in, Chamigo?

38
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,443
Not now, Gebo. The orchestra
is giving me a lot of work.

39
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,041
Nothing but the bass drum!
How the bass drum annoys me...

40
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,924
No one cares about art any more!

41
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,769
Goodbye.

42
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,850
Goodbye.
See you later, or tomorrow.

43
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,646
Come early so we can talk.

44
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,400
- I'm chilled to the bone!
- I know, I know...

45
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,243
I could feel you coming...

46
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,882
Sit here behind the kitchen door.
You'll be warmer there.

47
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,882
It's been so cold this year!

48
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,761
The last time I remember
a year like this was...

49
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,525
- Take off your boots. Here are your slippers...
- Thank you!

50
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,043
So did you see him?

51
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,126
Did you see him?

52
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,810
See him?
Who?

53
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,487
The fellow who writes to our son!
Did you speak to him?

54
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,246
Didn't you say that you'd bring
news of our son today?

55
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,249
I saw him, yes!

56
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,965
You bring this up out of the blue!

57
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,607
You don't give me time to think.
Of course I saw him.

58
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,766
He sends his regards.

59
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,449
- Is he well?
- He's fine!

60
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,002
You used to talk such a lot,
too much, even.

61
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,885
Now it's like getting
blood out of a stone.

62
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,449
<i>I'll go and see if the coffee's ready.</i>

63
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,406
Then I want all the details.

64
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,280
Don't upset yourself, father.

65
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,762
It's my fault. I'm so forgetful...

66
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,602
You should have reminded me.

67
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,328
Poor thing... If she knew!

68
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,250
If she had any idea!

69
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,129
Do you have any news?

70
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,045
Yes, I do.
News, yes...

71
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,809
- I think I saw him.
- You saw Joéo?

72
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,571
I saw a shadow in the night.

73
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,368
If she hears of it!

74
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,200
She's already suffered enough.

75
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:18,608
Lie, Gebo, deceive her.
Lie today, tomorrow, always,

76
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,165
spend your whole life lying, Just
don't let her suspect. Not ever!

77
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,045
Let her live her last days happy...

78
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,088
Yes, happy...

79
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,887
And you...

80
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,561
We left everything behind,
went far away,

81
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,606
moved to another part of the country
so she wouldn't find out...

82
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,962
Always telling her... always...

83
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,124
Yes. Always lying to her.

84
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,610
If you knew how hard that's been!

85
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,324
Worse than writing a serial
every evening.

86
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,329
I don't even know what to say
any more.

87
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,925
Stick it out, old man, stick it out...
so she doesn't ever find out.

88
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,802
So you saw him?
If he ever comes round here, father...

89
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,721
Round here? No.

90
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,446
If ever...
No, it can't have been him.

91
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,162
Just a shadow
that vanished into the night...

92
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,126
It's been eight years...

93
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,963
The wretch!
Forget him, lass.

94
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,851
A terrible life.
A different life...

95
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,641
A quite different life...

96
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,245
Yes, a wretched life...

97
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,085
Say it, father... say it...

98
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,887
He won't come. Don't worry.
I'd already seen him...

99
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,923
Did you speak to him?

100
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,765
It was over a year ago,
in a street far from here...

101
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,523
It was evening and...

102
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,171
I felt myself
being pulled into a dark corner...

103
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,286
Was it him?

104
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,841
He didn't speak.
I could only see his eyes.

105
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,845
But I recognised him right away.

106
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,690
Perhaps it was the hands.
They were frozen...

107
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,489
I recognised him right away

108
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,245
I gave him all the money I had on me

109
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,289
We didn't say anything to each other.

110
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,131
But I understood
even without speaking...

111
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,644
He's been gone many years.

112
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,522
But recently I sense I'm being followed

113
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,490
like being engulfed by a shadow...

114
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,441
A shadow?

115
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,400
A shadow, father?

116
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,929
It can't have been him...

117
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,727
But it was him, it was!

118
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,842
Oh, if she ever finds out that
the son she raised...

119
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,444
Father, tell me everything...

120
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,045
No. We have plenty
of time to talk.

121
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,041
I'd rather enter these accounts
in my book...

122
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,169
This is a great business,
Ramires 8. Ramires!

123
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,050
Just look at the balance for August,

124
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,846
ten contos and seven hundred and fifty
thousand reis. Not bad, huh?

125
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,245
Twenty thousand reis a month

126
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,169
and I still have to work at night so we don't
starve to death.

127
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,161
What do you say to that?

128
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,846
Nothing. I'm just thinking.

129
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,527
Brooding about our misfortune.
about that other life he leads...

130
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,161
Why does he lead such a wretched life,
such pain and hunger?

131
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,164
There's so much I'd like to know.
- Come on.

132
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,127
0, 0, 5... Band 7...
15. And 6 makes 21...

133
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,888
The light is good today.
Was it you that did the lamp?

134
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,843
It was me!

135
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,524
Here's your coffee.

136
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,443
We depend on your eyes.

137
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,244
Would you go and look
at the stove?

138
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Here I am, every day,
waiting to hear you..

139
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,803
I've got a lot to do this evening.

140
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,761
Don't get irritable.
Age tans the hide.

141
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,483
Let me cover your feet.

142
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,361
You can tell me everything
over coffee. Don't write.

143
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,089
So, you went into his house, that
fellow that writes to our son...

144
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,047
I did.

145
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,609
- And he read you the letter from our son?
- He did.

146
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,606
What did it say?

147
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,530
It said... it said...

148
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,244
He sends greetings.
As usual...

149
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,000
And he asked after his mother.

150
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,962
He did?

151
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,602
Why didn't you say right away?
You know I live for that...

152
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,001
I love to hear you so much! Go on, talk.
And next?

153
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,850
Next?
Goodness!

154
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Next... Well, we talked about this
and that, etc, etc.

155
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Etc?
You treat me so harshly!

156
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,250
Here I am waiting every day
just to hear you.

157
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,960
For years that's all I've had...

158
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,650
And then you come home and
don't say a word to make me suffer.

159
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,485
Doroteia!
What do you want me to say?

160
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,207
I don't know what else to invent...
I don't know... I can't...

161
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,087
In the business world, we don't
usually discuss family matters.

162
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,890
You always say the same,

163
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,528
half a dozen words.

164
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,323
And God knows, I have no
joy whatsoever in my life.

165
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,004
We live in this terrible poverty,

166
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,808
which gets more unbearable
by the year.

167
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,968
But I don't have
anything to say...

168
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,804
What there is I know very well!

169
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,208
Perhaps you don't even
know yourself...

170
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,561
And you've not noticed that gradually
I've changed into someone else...

171
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,370
someone full of pain and despair.

172
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,242
I've become another person,
without you even noticing,

173
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,931
in the silence of someone
that can't take any more.

174
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,891
Speak!
Speak!

175
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,529
For years I've been waiting for you
to tell me what I want to know!

176
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,322
Oh, Doroteia, know what?
What do you want to know?

177
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,167
Always misery, misfortune!
And me here waiting...

178
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,087
Leave me alone...

179
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,923
Could you get me some more coffee?

180
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,841
Yes, of course.

181
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,285
<i>If you don't speak, I'll die.</i>

182
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,888
If I didn't know you were my friend,
I would doubt you.

183
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,840
You know this is the only happiness
I have... you are taking it from me!

184
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,722
Don't torment me, listen...

185
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,563
You and Sophia, nothing affects you!
But me! Oh, how I've wept!

186
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,961
Poor thing! She's suffered a lot too,
we have to spare her.

187
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,844
Just like me.

188
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,802
She's his wife and
she hasn't seen him again.

189
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,685
Think what that must be like,
suffering in silence never complaining.

190
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,449
Have you ever
heard her complain?

191
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,963
What about me? All I've
been through! Eight years!

192
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,965
For what it's worth, I've
swallowed so many tears.

193
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,886
And when I want to talk
about our son, you go dumb.

194
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:18,211
You plunge into your books
so she won't go without.

195
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,010
It's as if she were
our daughter...

196
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,920
What wouldn't we give
to see them both happy?

197
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,769
We gave them everything.

198
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,368
With life this hard, I've
often thought about dying!

199
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,328
- About what?
- Dying, yes!

200
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,201
We almost want to die.

201
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,930
It was you and her
that bound me to life.

202
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,809
Listen to you!

203
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,848
I like talking
about our daughter.

204
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,444
I remember when she arrived,
still little, after my brother died.

205
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,130
Then she grew up and
we married them...

206
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,323
But you never talk about our son,
you don't say a word about him.

207
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,807
You've always loved her
more than him.

208
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,566
Because he went away, didn't
want to put up with this life we lead,

209
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,520
because he's ambitious.
He takes that after me.

210
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,322
A double-edged sword...

211
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,129
You think it's better to be like you,
doing nothing to get on in life?

212
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,842
They laugh at you. You're pitiful.
Everyone despises you.

213
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,725
Your friends all got rich, while
you're a bill-collector for a company,

214
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,568
always the same salary
and the same problems.

215
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,400
In the office, everyone says:
"Poor Gebo"...

216
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,050
And you take it!
- What else can I do?

217
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,088
"But Gebo is honest".

218
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,842
You never took the chance
to get rich when you could...

219
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,686
I always did my duty.
I did what I could.

220
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,409
I did everything for you.

221
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,243
Yes, I've done my part!

222
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,249
I'm an honest man.

223
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,961
Look at the others!
They got rich, they're happy...

224
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,804
Only God knows that!

225
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,570
While we, poor wretches...

226
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,245
Did you leave the stove on?
We need to make more coffee.

227
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,050
<i>I'll make some more later
so we don't have to heat it up.</i>

228
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,844
Very well.
I've got to work till late.

229
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,564
And it's bitterly cold.

230
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,090
My son...

231
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,008
What?
What?

232
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,607
I can't get him out of my mind.
Sometimes I feel like running away,

233
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,369
like leaving everything and
going out into the world.

234
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:42,686
And 7 makes 14... Going off
just like that? And 7 makes 21

235
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,444
So do I.
Life is always the same.

236
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,089
Like the rain falling outside
onto the eaves, drop by drop.

237
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,088
Always that
monotonous sound of the rain...

238
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,002
Life is always the same thing.

239
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,809
Our life, yes.

240
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,483
We wear the same old clothes,
darn them, wear them again.

241
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,330
- 'What if something happens to us?
- 'What kind of thing?

242
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,966
Good fortune in life is
when nothing happens.

243
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,922
So good fortune is routine?!

244
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,523
Perhaps. Good fortune is
always doing the same work,

245
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,329
saying the same words.

246
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,290
Like the rain.
Not thinking about it.

247
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,126
Not thinking about it!
I think all the time.

248
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,930
<i>Even when I'm in my grave
I'll be thinking!</i>

249
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,322
Is there just this one kind of life?
Just one?

250
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,249
All lives are like this.

251
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,003
My life is so monotonous,
so cold it's unbearable!

252
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,769
Sometimes,
I wonder if I'm alive or dead.

253
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,481
Not even my dreams
matter any more:

254
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,443
they're all spent.

255
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,043
And is there no other life but this?

256
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,806
For me, when I finish work,
and sit down here,

257
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,642
with my books at my side,

258
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,569
listening to the rain...

259
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,291
How it falls, this rain!...
... I'm not unhappy.

260
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,085
Quite the opposite. I feel fine
with you both near me...

261
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,961
We've been

262
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,602
doing the same thing
for the last forty years,

263
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,644
in poverty, humility.

264
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,571
And my dreams have all worn out,
spoilt by life...

265
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,002
Is there no other life for us?

266
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,524
We have lived our lives,
done our duty.

267
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,322
I don't know if we were put
into this world to be happy...

268
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:56,650
If this is all there was to life, the
same actions, the same words,

269
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,604
I would die.
I couldn't live.

270
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,287
All that saves me

271
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,168
is my dreams,
what remains of them.

272
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,928
Closed-in, alone,
the more alone the better,

273
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,930
I can dream of my son.

274
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,490
For you, your son
is less than a stranger.

275
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,408
God help me!

276
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,969
It's true! He changed towards me
the moment he married.

277
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,044
Doroteia!
That's enough!

278
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,850
I need to talk. I need
to get it off my chest!

279
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,488
As if that weren't enough, it was her
that turned you against him.

280
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,410
Mother!
Mother!

281
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,846
You're ungrateful, Doroteia. If only
you knew how ungrateful...

282
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,641
- What?
- Nothing!

283
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,769
I know! I know!

284
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,523
We took her in,
looked after her.

285
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,321
Without us she would have starved.
No one wanted anything to do with her.

286
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,922
And in exchange, she took our
son's affection away from us.

287
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,728
For God's sake,
shut up now!

288
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,446
But it doesn't matter.
I love him enough for both of you.

289
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,845
And the less you love him,
the more I do.

290
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,807
Ah! So you heard?
All the better.

291
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,324
I'm going to bed,
But I won't sleep.

292
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,927
<i>I'll be thinking about him.
I spend my nights thinking.</i>

293
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,644
Aren't you going
to say anything?

294
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,488
Aren't you going to say anything?

295
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,450
Don't cry, lass.
Don't cry.

296
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,083
Let her cry. I've also shed
a great many tears.

297
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,805
My son only has me.

298
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,401
Are you crying?
Serves you right.

299
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,883
It's the unhappiness
that has made her so bitter.

300
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,651
She's worn herself out thinking,
suffering.

301
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,165
'What's wrong with you?
'What's the matter?

302
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:30,090
Nothing, father.
I'm afraid!

303
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,928
So aml!

304
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:43,370
We're living under a shadow.
I can't take it. I'm afraid.

305
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,001
It's my son,
he's a miserable wretch!

306
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:58,562
Maybe the police are after him.
Maybe he has nowhere to sleep.

307
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,564
The day before yesterday, I thought
I saw him at the corner of the road.

308
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,330
I wondered if he had food...

309
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,440
If he was hungry!

310
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,008
If she hears of this,
she'll die.

311
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,768
Listen...

312
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,569
That's her.

313
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,488
She's in the bedroom...
talking to herself... mulling it over.

314
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:39,130
Now go to bed. I'm going to
stay up working till late.

315
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,604
- All right. Good night, father.
- Good night.

316
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,249
Poor thing...

317
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,124
So silent and so sad.

318
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,648
Always in this hole,
embroidering.

319
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,602
I know you so well.

320
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,250
You get worked up! So worked up!
But you never say a word.

321
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,845
Pray for me, do you hear? For all of us
and for him most of all.

322
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,604
For him, yes.
Don't forget.

323
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,846
Good night.

324
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,243
Come on, now Gebo...
you've got a bit of peace.

325
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,809
Peace?

326
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,724
As I remember, I only have that
when I'm asleep.

327
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,682
Only then can I forget!

328
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,240
There are people in this world
that are so happy!

329
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,240
8 and 7... 15, and 6 makes 21...
Carry 2... 7... 15... 90...

330
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,289
Cast out the nines, zero.
No, that won't work.

331
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,360
So 1... 2... 3...
Carry 5... carry 5... carry 5...

332
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,531
Half past nine already!
Time passes...

333
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,163
So 1... 2... 3...

334
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,487
You!

335
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,483
Hello, father!

336
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,567
I hear footsteps in the courtyard.
It must be Chamigo.

337
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,563
It must be him.
He never misses his coffee.

338
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,211
Sometimes you can see in his eyes
that he's dying for coffee.

339
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,130
If I didn't give him any,
he'd cry.

340
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,849
He's not doing too well, the old man.
God knows how he gets by.

341
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,563
Sometimes it pains me.

342
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,447
Here he is.

343
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,808
- Would you allow an artist...?
- Please come in.

344
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,525
You're a little late.

345
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,363
Come in and sit down.

346
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,248
- Sit down.
- Madam...

347
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,881
Well, Mr Chamigo... what do think
about this cold weather?

348
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,842
It's bitter.

349
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,523
<i>I'll get you a coffee.</i>

350
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,608
And how's business going, Chamigo?

351
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,444
So-so.
Could be better.

352
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,170
But now the management has decided to
put on another play, a fairy tale..

353
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,926
Oh, yes...
Is it well staged?

354
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,721
You can imagine... with Torres.

355
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,683
Ah, Torres!

356
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,561
So 7 and 8 makes 15 and 6, 21...

357
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,323
Torres, yes...
And have you had big audiences?

358
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,042
The fairground tent
does us a disservice.

359
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,682
And the weather doesn't help...
Rain... And a shortage of money.

360
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,610
Everyone's complaining about
the same thing, my friend.

361
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,484
But why don't they put
the show on at night?

362
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,445
Too expensive...
The lighting alone...

363
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,249
- Guess how much the lighting costs?
- I've no idea.

364
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,725
For the oil alone, 820. Imagine!
You see. Torres can't.

365
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,600
Ah!... 8 and 8 makes 16, and 1...

366
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,450
8 and 8, 16, carry 1.

367
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,127
May I?

368
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,923
What a surprise!

369
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,842
Today was the Sousas' day.

370
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,689
But the Sousas are away.
Their uncle's ill...

371
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,364
So here am I!
- Very good!

372
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,162
Good evening, my dear!

373
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,009
Hello, Candidinha.

374
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,002
Sit down!
Coffee's almost ready.

375
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,960
Do you want a drop?

376
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,769
- Ah, yes! With pleasure.
- Ah! Here's the coffee...

377
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:47,087
Coffee gives me palpitations.
It'll take me to an early grave.

378
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,045
The cups, Sofia?
- I've got no illusions.

379
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,766
Only yesterday I said to the Teles:

380
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,888
"My grave is dug...

381
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,691
My burial clothes are all laid out ready.
I don't want to put anyone out. "

382
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,527
Ruthless, eh?

383
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,206
Yes, dear, that's a bit ruthless.

384
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,044
Here's your coffee.

385
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,724
It smells so good!

386
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,806
The smell is not bad for you...

387
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,806
Quite the reverse.

388
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,006
It's boiling!

389
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,526
Do you mind if I drink it like this?
- Go on, drink up, drink up.

390
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,523
Give him a bit more coffee.

391
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,090
So your son's finally arrived?

392
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,848
Coffee always warms me up.

393
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,761
Sorry to be rude,

394
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,530
but before I devoted myself to the arts,
I was a soldier...

395
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,563
Goon... goon...

396
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,164
Who's the lucky fellow
that will receive that, eh?

397
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,131
It's got no owner yet.

398
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,691
And 7 makes 49...

399
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,566
Oh, Chamigo,
such manners!

400
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,450
Madam!
I don't believe it!

401
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,284
In my time, that token
would've been for me.

402
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,204
You wouldn't have got away...

403
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,247
Did you have a secret?

404
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,202
Don't laugh,

405
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,964
I was very successful.
Yes, I had a secret.

406
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,729
I played the flute!

407
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,484
That was how I seduced them!

408
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,403
Playing the flute!

409
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,371
That's right, my dear man. That was
how I won over my dead missus.

410
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,129
There's nothing that expresses love
better than music!

411
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,803
And you didn't whisper
sweet nothings to each other?

412
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:59,204
And at the end, I'd get up, and I'd say:
"Good night, Serafina".

413
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,161
Nothing more?

414
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,841
I didn't have to. She'd already
taken the bait...

415
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,367
Do you hear? How the rain beats
against the glass!

416
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,806
- There's thunder again...
- The sky was all black when I got here.

417
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,047
Hark how it rumbles!

418
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,402
So long as I'm warm...

419
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,241
But it reminds me...

420
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,362
Of what, my love?

421
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,971
The great flood.

422
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,681
Here's more coffee. Nice and hot,
with this cold weather.

423
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,524
So, my dear,

424
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,523
you're all pleased
now your son's here?

425
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,441
Yes, I am!

426
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,327
Give me some.

427
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,927
Your husband's brought
a lot of money, it seems!

428
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,001
I think so.

429
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,886
Another drop, father?

430
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,569
Yes, fill it up!

431
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,444
What a winter!

432
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,163
Is this how you spend your evenings?
Every night? Always?

433
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,929
We talk, we work...

434
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,008
Yes, we talk and we work.

435
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,649
Do you hear?
A lovely march.

436
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,847
I like it...

437
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,409
What I'd like is to have the time
to invent my own things.

438
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,166
But the rehearsals,
and days busy playing:

439
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,044
<i>Put your little foot here</i>

440
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,121
It's disheartening.

441
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,684
That's all the public wants.

442
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,763
No one has any taste any more.
We're heading towards the abyss.

443
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,563
Oh, art!

444
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,483
When I think about art...

445
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,045
When I think about art...

446
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,921
I suffocate. I've felt a great weight
on me since I came in here.

447
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,844
I start thinking about art
and I get sad.

448
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,522
Who doesn't feel that?

449
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,322
So I start playing all on my own,
any old thing...

450
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,127
In front of my window is a blank wall, a
massive blank wall with no openings in it.

451
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,847
I look at that blank wall
and I play...

452
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,449
and the darkness goes away...

453
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,563
Art is a great consolation.

454
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,203
To me, everyone looks deformed...

455
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,043
Like different people...
- Different people?

456
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,845
Those with petty useless lives...

457
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,848
There's nothing like art.

458
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,561
I was born for it...
to live from my art.

459
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,089
I feel that, if they let me,
I would create, write...

460
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,201
Write what?

461
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,963
What, my dear friend?

462
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,886
Why, a march!

463
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,684
<i>I'll just say this:
perhaps I'll write a march.</i>

464
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,727
Bravo!

465
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,443
Would you have any biscuits,
by any chance?

466
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,201
I'm feeling a little weak. I think the
palpitations might be coming on.

467
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,207
<i>I'll go and get them.</i>

468
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,644
What a dark night! With all these
crimes you see in the papers...

469
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,405
You must have read about them...
I'm always afraid when I go home.

470
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,210
And you're just down the road.
- Crimes, eh?

471
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,250
Yes,

472
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,162
Horrible crimes. Sends a
shiver down your spine.

473
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,888
Everyone commits crimes.

474
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:42,962
Now this!

475
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,764
At least in their thoughts...

476
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,723
Everything you say here is useless.

477
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,328
You don't know what life is!

478
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,328
Life...
- Shut up!

479
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,085
Not everyone can
live the same life.

480
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,962
You have to be soulless
to commit a crime.

481
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,890
But there are some
that refuse to be trampled on...

482
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,361
Some are like sheep, others rebel...

483
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,522
They see the world in a different way.

484
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,927
Bravo!

485
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,170
Some, like my father,

486
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,044
were born to kiss
the hand that feeds them.

487
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,081
That's what I've always said!

488
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,403
- Others...
- Others?

489
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,409
It was for them that jails were made.

490
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,443
But there's a time before jail!

491
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,168
And in jail you also eat bread.

492
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,208
"Better dead
than be buried alive!"

493
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,127
Son!

494
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,804
Let me talk...

495
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,649
Everyone commits crimes.

496
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,723
Serious crimes are committed
every day,

497
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,451
crimes of lying, servility.

498
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,641
Serious crimes,

499
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,245
and sometimes there's nothing
stopping us from killing.

500
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,287
Shut up!

501
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,804
One night...

502
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,729
a night like this

503
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,768
I was wet through to the bone
and I was hungry.

504
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,369
It was after midnight.

505
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:28,129
I saw the street all deserted and I decided
that I wasn't going to die of hunger.

506
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,321
Hunger!

507
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,807
A moment of anguish and despair...
Blackness all around me...

508
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,567
Not just the blackness of the night and
of the huge wall next to me...

509
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,521
but bigger, thicker.
It was the blackness of my soul.

510
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,281
I felt there was no one in the world
more wretched than me.

511
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,970
I stuck close to the wall.
I was alone,

512
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,606
or at least I thought I was
that night...

513
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,403
Just me and despair,
just me and the blackness.

514
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,290
The first man that passed, I would
grab him round the neck with my hands...

515
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,163
I heard footsteps
at the end of the deserted street

516
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,091
and I hid in the darkness
ready to attack...

517
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,606
The figure approached.

518
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,487
Then I saw at my side
two huge disembodied hands,

519
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,326
in the lamplight.

520
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:48,006
And they suddenly clenched in the air,
squeezed, suffocating...

521
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,729
Then there was a thud
as a body fell...

522
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,727
I ran off into the night crying:
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

523
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,368
How horrible!
How horrible!

524
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,281
Horrible?

525
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,162
That soul
that everyone despised,

526
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,846
that being
that was once a man,

527
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:21,404
and who had been brought to crime by others,
through their selfishness and indifference,

528
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,081
a man like other men
who was hungry and wanted to live...

529
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,045
A soul... Wasn't it you
that was just talking about a soul?

530
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,800
Something that knows no limits to its pain
and its dreams...

531
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,564
You've no idea what it is!

532
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,369
My Soul!

533
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,084
I don't know what my soul is.

534
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,883
It's very deep!

535
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,888
If I look carefully...

536
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,521
Have you thought about that? You that live
to repeat the same things over and over again?

537
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:19,011
If I look carefully, I see in the depths
shadows that scare me...

538
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,884
the soul of a creature
that can't stand life,

539
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,801
this life

540
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,683
that you all put up with so well!

541
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,643
A soul that cries out and dreams

542
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:41,291
and can't stand this world of terror,
wretchedness and pain!

543
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,930
Don't you know there are
criminals with a soul

544
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,649
and men that don't have one?

545
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:57,409
You are all buried alive...

546
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,289
<i>I'll tell you something else...</i>

547
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,167
If each one of us committed the murders
we've dreamed about,

548
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,164
out of hatred, ambition
or for gain,

549
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,765
it'd be a bloodbath.

550
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,761
That's true!

551
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:25,530
Any one of us could commit a crime
tomorrow.

552
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,683
Yes, it's funny!
That's a funny thing...

553
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,728
Joéo, shut up!
Shut up!

554
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,407
As you wish!

555
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,244
Are you intending to kill her?

556
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,048
Kill us?

557
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,048
Oh, you always make such a fuss!

558
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,886
I'm getting palpitations now.

559
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,569
Do you think he's been to jail?

560
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,521
He could have been,
judging by his demeanour.

561
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,521
What are you saying?

562
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,321
Did I miss something?

563
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,121
Nothing,

564
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,924
a joke. That's all.

565
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,765
Whew! It's hot.

566
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,770
Hot!
With this cold!

567
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,406
I wouldn't call it hot.
So-so.

568
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,524
So what's new?

569
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,928
In politics, it just gets worse.
We need a man with a firm hand.

570
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,086
Another Marquis of Pombal.

571
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,687
A biscuit?

572
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,801
No, thanks.

573
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Well, then...
79 and 9, that's 88, carry...

574
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,166
and carry...

575
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,963
Now I don't know how much it was!

576
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,680
A great shortage of money!

577
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,644
But this...

578
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,688
this is a lot of money.

579
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,485
Yes! Almost one come.

580
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,325
Seven thousand reis.

581
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,290
- At the end of the year, there's a lot to collect.
- There's no more coffee!

582
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,203
And it's heavy!

583
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,006
<i>One come'.!</i>

584
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,690
I've got no idea what it would be like
to have so much money.

585
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,451
A thousand reis is a lot.

586
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,609
So seven thousand reis!

587
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,963
Joéo?

588
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,287
Are you coming?

589
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,963
Imagine everything
that's in here!

590
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,011
Silk dresses, sweets,
everything.

591
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,645
It must be marvellous
to have so much money.

592
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,567
It even gives off heat!

593
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,205
Able to order everyone about:

594
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,207
"Do this! Don't do that!
Get out! Get out of my sight!"

595
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,810
I wish I had someone
I could order about!

596
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,729
I wouldn't think twice.

597
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,521
To say that here inside...
I don't know! Everything!

598
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,364
It must be really nice
to have a lot of money!

599
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,124
Seven hundred reis
right under our noses!

600
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,843
Think what's inside!

601
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,929
So much money
right under our noses!

602
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,966
I'm used to it.

603
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,722
I don't even remember
that it's money!

604
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,522
Zero...

605
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,331
Do you hear?
Half past nine.

606
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,327
Already?

607
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,169
It's the clock on the tower.

608
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,840
Right, old friend. Time to go.
Goodbye. Thank you!

609
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,763
<i>I'll go too.</i>

610
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,648
The rain's cleared a bit.

611
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,327
Thanks!

612
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,246
So much money!

613
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,889
Careful with the step.

614
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,763
- Yes, thanks.
- Thanks!

615
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,641
Just down here.

616
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,529
Goodbye

617
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,521
Good night.

618
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,884
They've gone.

619
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,089
I'm feeling worn out tonight.

620
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,166
Are you going to bed?

621
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,963
Yes.
I'm going now.

622
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,841
Are you coming, Doroteia?

623
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,603
No, I'm going to stay here talking
to my son.

624
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,286
Son...

625
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,167
Yes?

626
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,963
There are some things
I'd like to ask you.

627
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,850
You should tell me everything.
I'm your mother.

628
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,562
Yes?

629
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,407
Wait.

630
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,369
Let me look at you.

631
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,243
If you knew how much I've suffered!

632
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,161
Don't get annoyed.

633
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,844
I wanted to ask you...

634
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,801
I have to say...

635
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,445
there's something
I don't know about you...

636
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,442
Just now. I was almost afraid.

637
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,322
It was difficult for me to find
your other face...

638
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,929
My other face?

639
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,488
The one you had
when you were little.

640
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,445
There's something
I want you to tell me.

641
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,291
Leave me alone... Leave me alone...
now leave me alone...

642
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,083
I need to be alone.

643
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,928
I've got used to solitude.

644
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,724
There are times when people
all seem monstrous,

645
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,846
different.

646
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,601
You can't understand.

647
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,401
You upset me!

648
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,241
It's also hard for me
to find my other face,

649
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:23,762
the one I always knew,
the one I've always dealt with.

650
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,644
Son!

651
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,647
But wait.

652
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,284
You love me...

653
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,326
So speak!

654
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,201
You're my dear mama after all.

655
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,011
Son, I can feel something...

656
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,691
I don't know what, but I can feel it.
You're miserable.

657
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:04,244
Yesterday I dreamt that I saw you
all ragged and thin

658
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,249
in a road with no end.

659
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,804
You were hungry and
you were looking at me.

660
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,808
I stretched out my arms
with a cry

661
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,721
but I couldn't hold you back.

662
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,523
You went off down that road
with no end

663
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,560
to a destiny full of pain.

664
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,089
Pain?

665
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,085
Despair.

666
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,845
You have to tell me
about your life...

667
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,766
My life...

668
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,401
Many times
I believed you dead,

669
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,362
many times I was cold

670
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,128
when I thought
you were cold.

671
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,121
Tell me everything...

672
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:10,486
In those wretched days you always
appeared to me as you did when I was small.

673
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,283
And then...
- Then...

674
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,401
The night came again.

675
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,210
Talk. I don't get tired
listening to you.

676
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,731
We can stay here
the whole night talking...

677
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:35,409
- I never forgot you.
- I never forgot you either.

678
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:42,400
Even on the darkest days
I saw you and heard you.

679
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,011
Sometimes you spoke to me
as if from the bottom of a grave...

680
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,604
But it was me that was dead.

681
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,569
Poor wretch!

682
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,489
Poor wretch!

683
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,290
Maybe I know more
than you think.

684
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:12,922
Maybe I guess...
- I'm not like other people!

685
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,047
I'm different.

686
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,644
Dominated by something
much stronger.

687
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,530
Maybe I don't even
command myself.

688
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,481
I am...

689
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,049
Go and sleep now.

690
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,080
Heading for misery?

691
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,683
Pitilessly.

692
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,525
I am he that causes suffering

693
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,289
and laughs.

694
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,289
Listen.

695
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,164
Maybe I know more
than you think.

696
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,851
Talk to me!
- Later.

697
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,041
Go to bed.

698
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,563
I've waited years.

699
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,369
Now leave me alone.

700
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,124
Leave me alone.

701
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,849
They won't hear.

702
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:31,644
I understand if you don't tell them
anything, but I'm your mother...

703
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,563
Are you cold?

704
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,442
I've put my shawl
on your bed.

705
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,366
Good night.

706
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,890
I've got to tidy up the kitchen.
Do you want to come?

707
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,006
No, thanks.

708
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,688
All right.
I won't be long.

709
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,211
This drains my strength away.

710
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,086
I don't know why,
even the night upsets me...

711
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,687
I knew an old man, who
when night came,

712
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,530
would go to the bars
to breathe in deeply...

713
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:45,204
Deep down those that kill
are the ones with the biggest hearts...

714
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,287
'What's the matter?

715
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,170
Almost ten... Aren't you going to bed?
- Let me breathe!

716
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,041
'What's the matter?

717
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,680
When night comes,
another life comes over me.

718
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,407
On some nights, the deepest ones,
I feel that I've become someone else.

719
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,811
If you could see me!

720
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,091
A being so different
from what you know!

721
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:41,805
A stranger whose name I don't know
who takes control of me and takes me

722
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,766
by force.

723
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,807
By force.

724
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:51,447
Shut up! And please,
could you close the window? I can't.

725
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,523
I surprise even myself.

726
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,448
A living being,
not a dead man...

727
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,290
When others cry,
I laugh.

728
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,602
Now we have found each other again.

729
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,365
Wretch...
Wretch!

730
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,330
Wretch,
she called me that too.

731
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,160
It's you
that are the wretches.

732
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,128
Do you really think this is living?

733
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,126
Spending your days here

734
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,770
always starting over
in the same way in this hole?

735
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,650
- And dying? Dying?
- And then dying.

736
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:07,249
You live like blind men. But there are
other things... other living beings.

737
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,162
To work like Gebo!
Be him!

738
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,844
I'd rather rebel
and then die.

739
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,688
Look how my hands are cold...

740
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,366
Let the night in.

741
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,121
Now go.

742
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,809
Shut up and go.

743
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,887
What are you doing?

744
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,530
I can't take it any more, Joéo.
I'm going to scream!

745
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,402
Just as well.

746
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,607
What are doing?

747
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,442
You know I'm a thief,
you know

748
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,209
- Yes.
- A thief.

749
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,082
Do you want
to run away with me?

750
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,004
Shouldn't you be by my side
for better or for worse?

751
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,927
I'm your wife.

752
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,370
I'm alone in the world
but I know things you don't.

753
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,285
I know what hunger is,
what it is to kill and to die.

754
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,801
There are nights when I flee
like a hunted animal,

755
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:34,525
and there are times when I feel in myself
something else, something immense...

756
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,360
I can see people cry, see them scream...
Thief!

757
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,963
Being a thief!

758
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,889
You're our curse.

759
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,845
Are you going to kill them both? Is that
what you want? Old father and mother?

760
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,444
I have no father or mother,
I have no one.

761
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,291
What are you saying?
What are you doing?

762
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,488
- I'm stealing.
- Joéo...

763
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,287
Joéo!

764
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,851
Speak more quietly!

765
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,803
You'll lose yourself
and you'll lose us!

766
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,804
You'll be the end of the old man!
No! No! No!

767
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,683
Father! Father!
Come! Help!

768
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,448
Kill me!
You're not getting through!

769
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,807
Son! Stealing!
If she finds out...

770
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,610
What's going on?
What's that noise?

771
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,569
Nothing, it's nothing.

772
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,446
An argument between them.

773
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,206
So don't cry.
It's not worth it.

774
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,924
I give you my word of honour!
They're arguing... that's all.

775
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,766
These things happen...
Nothing more...

776
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,810
- And Sofia?
- She's gone after him.

777
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,645
Here he comes.
Finally...

778
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,283
No one has seen him,
no one.

779
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,161
This umbrella was so good!

780
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,803
How quickly things spoil!

781
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,846
It didn't used to be like this.

782
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,401
Don't worry about the umbrella.
Tell me if you found him?

783
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,201
I've told you,
no one's seen him.

784
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,169
I asked everyone.

785
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,049
You see this tear!

786
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:55,604
How can you go to work
with this weather?

787
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,488
I think the papers are
forecasting good weather...

788
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,444
Has my director sent a message?
- No.

789
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,080
They'll be around soon
And then...

790
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,009
either he or I...

791
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,127
Who?

792
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,965
No one. I'm talking about
the weather. It's going to change.

793
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,688
We're going to have a very
dry winter, you'll see.

794
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,447
As for going to work...
It's been three days!

795
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,160
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know...

796
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,009
And the money, father?
The money?

797
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,490
Is she crying?

798
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,087
Yes...

799
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,369
She's crying.

800
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,082
She who kept saying

801
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,201
"When my son comes, you'll see!
Our misery will be over".

802
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:05,809
"It'll all be over", yes...
Her whole life living this illusion.

803
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:12,563
For me, I don't mind,
We can get used to anything. But her...

804
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,441
Is she crying?

805
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,364
Yes. But...

806
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,170
she's not the only one that suffers.
What will become of us all now?

807
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,926
She can't find out!
It's her last hope.

808
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,531
It looks like I'm wet...

809
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,366
On my face,
on my face too.

810
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,324
It must be from the rain.

811
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,288
Look, you've got me crying now!

812
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,240
Such a good umbrella!

813
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,965
Everything's so expensive,
and the money's gone...

814
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,846
Where's this all going to end?

815
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,483
That's what I wonder too...

816
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,403
But...
Maybe she knows everything...

817
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,081
No! If she knew everything,
she would have died.

818
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:55,686
"I wish to...

819
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,531
"inform you...

820
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,250
"that the money...

821
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:12,964
"collected...

822
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,800
"seven hundred
and fifty escudos...

823
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,167
"and seventy five reis...

824
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:42,721
"belonging to
the Auxiliary Company...

825
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:50,361
"Limited...

826
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,204
"was stolen...

827
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:03,763
"the night before last...

828
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,567
"in my house.

829
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,207
"The thief

830
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:20,171
is unknown".

831
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,766
"The thief
is unknown".

832
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,561
But they're so rich!
Wouldn't they forgive you?

833
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,761
Forgive?

834
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,368
When money's involved,
no one ever forgives.

835
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,203
I was forgetting the date!

836
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,286
- But father...
- Yes.

837
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:49,809
So our duty is to be poor
to be miserable our whole lives?

838
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,565
It's better to confess everything.
- No!

839
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,449
Let's go and bang on the door
and shout: "Your son... "

840
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,642
No, no.
Never!

841
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,284
Speak quietly.

842
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,323
Inside, all I do is scream

843
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,086
and yet I speak softly
so she doesn't hear,

844
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,043
so no one hears.

845
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,884
The more I say
"Don't upset yourself"

846
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:21,603
<i>she says "If you take him from me,
now that I've seen him... I'll die. "</i>

847
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,405
It's my fault the house
was mortgaged and sold.

848
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:35,121
She's got lost
in a bitter useless dream...

849
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,609
If everything we do
is useless,

850
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,606
if we die deluded,
there'll be no future life!

851
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,563
But what do you want me
to do, lass?

852
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,045
I can't be anything else.

853
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,050
If you knew
how much I've suffered!

854
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,850
Who's going to give me work
after what's happened?

855
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,202
For a long time the Company
had me there out of pity...

856
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,162
Charity?

857
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,128
Out of charity, father?
- Yes.

858
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,762
We've been silent,
for eight years!

859
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,482
You should shout out the truth.

860
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,403
That would be killing her
with my own hands.

861
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:39,121
I'd rather die
than tell her the truth.

862
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,326
My duty is something else.

863
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,049
Always duty...

864
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,962
Can you hear her?

865
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,000
Yes.
She's crying.

866
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,529
Just crying.

867
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,529
A man should be just
and honest above all else.

868
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,244
Or... should he want
to get rich?

869
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,201
So you have doubts too?

870
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,848
None of us knows himself.

871
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,729
I can't take any more!

872
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,524
Daughter!

873
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,129
I'm afraid of him!

874
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,126
I'm afraid of him!

875
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,048
I'd rather not
see him again!

876
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,646
If you had seen
what I saw!

877
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,569
If you'd heard!

878
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,521
But he's your husband.

879
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,085
In another life, which isn't
even his nor ours.

880
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,006
Another bigger life...

881
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,843
Maybe the truth!

882
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,807
In heaven?

883
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,441
In this world many people suffer,
and does anyone hear their cries?

884
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:20,041
Wait... Evil?
Evil is impossible!

885
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,083
Wait while I try to understand...

886
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,887
See!

887
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,888
If we could see!

888
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,609
In this horrible world
it's natural that

889
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,126
those that reach
a poor old age...

890
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,049
Old and poor...

891
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,043
Old and poor...

892
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,880
are trodden on
by those they most love.

893
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,728
No, father, no!

894
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,282
See...
Yes, see!

895
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,005
Yes, I want to see!
I want to see!

896
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,170
No! No!

897
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,687
No!

898
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,769
This hurts so much!

899
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,247
Run away...
could we run away?

900
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,367
Run where?

901
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,326
No one can escape misery.

902
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,929
We'd be better off dead!

903
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,889
I've always lied to her,

904
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:48,362
we've spent our whole lives like this,
me lying, her crying and dreaming.

905
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,010
Don't cry, daughter.
Don't cry...

906
01:24:54,280 --> 01:25:01,880
<i>Go to her and tell her.
- No. I'll never leave you.</i>

907
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,724
What's needed
on these occasions

908
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,400
is for each one
to know his duty.

909
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,326
That's the truth.

910
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,160
I hear it
but I don't understand it.

911
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,569
If we run away and abandon our
principles, we'll be in his hands.

912
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,322
Now I'm in the way,
that's all there is to it.

913
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:41,245
Maybe he'll repent
and remember his duty.

914
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,970
Go to your mother.

915
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,764
If it wasn't for duty,
I wouldn't even have raised you.

916
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,763
You were one more mouth to feed...

917
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,646
Can you hear her?

918
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,450
Yes.
She's still crying.

919
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,124
Just crying.

920
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,920
The most important thing is that
she doesn't find out anything. Ever!

921
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,290
My duty is something else.

922
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,924
Don't cry, please,
it's all sorted out.

923
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,927
Father!

924
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,529
Yes, it's all sorted out.

925
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,285
Don't cry any more,
do you hear me?

926
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,322
But how, father?

927
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,283
Now leave me.

928
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,891
Go and calm her.

929
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,849
Go and calm her.

930
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,290
How this hurts me.
How this hurts me.

931
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,281
It's them!

932
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,969
Don't open it!

933
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,008
Wife!
Daughter!

934
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,762
Wait!

935
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,767
Here they are!

936
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,441
Here they are!

937
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,241
No!
Father!

938
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,043
- It's him! It's him!
- It's the thief! It's the thief!

939
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:23,480
Yes,
I'm the thief.

940
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,208
It was me that stole it.
