2
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,815
Why'd you stop?

3
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,760
It's the Booth House.

4
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,935
You know, a family used to live
here a while back, right?

5
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,037
Yeah, I heard they went missing.

6
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,906
Because of the curse.

7
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:42,974
What curse?

8
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:47,178
A witch used to live here, man.
Now this place is cursed.

9
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,646
Wait,
you haven't heard about this?

10
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:54,752
Well, she and her daughter lived
here when this place was first built.

11
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,021
When her daughter died,
she was blamed for it.

12
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,156
They say, she locked
herself in the basement,

13
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,125
and eventually,
she killed herself.

14
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,995
Dude, no.
That's not even close to what I heard.

15
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:07,664
I heard the guy who used to live
here, Mr. Booth, was a monster.

16
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,233
He went crazy,
killed his whole family,

17
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,500
and then shot himself.

18
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,671
Yeah, but what about the bodies?
The bodies were never found.

19
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,008
They say, he hid the bodies
somewhere inside the house,

20
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,909
that's why their ghosts
are stuck here.

21
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,679
I guess no one
really knows, then.

22
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:23,646
Yeah.

23
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,287
Dude, it's late. We should go.

24
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,193
Where are you going?

25
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,078
Dude, what are you doing?

26
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,938
What is wrong with you?

27
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:24,341
Why you're always such a wuss?

28
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,243
You always say you want
to do something scary,

29
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:28,645
but only when it's made up.

30
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:29,980
- Shut up.
- Gosh...

31
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,023
Dude, up there!

32
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,792
What?

33
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,136
Let's get out of here!

34
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,398
<i>Every house has a story.</i>

35
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:26,270
<i>A story that lives inside it,</i>

36
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,805
<i>like a memory in a brain.</i>

37
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:31,842
<i>The characters
of these stories are the ghosts</i>

38
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:34,378
<i>of the people who once
inhabited these places.</i>

39
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,681
<i>Who lived out their narratives
only to forget</i>

40
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,951
<i>and be forgotten
by the passage of time.</i>

41
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:47,258
<i>But in some places,
these stories are never quite finished,</i>

42
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,996
<i>leaving the spirits to wander
aimlessly like a spinning wheel.</i>

43
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,198
And I think...

44
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:57,168
that's what's been going on
at the Booth House

45
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,402
for the last 30 years.

46
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:04,942
The horrors that happened to the
missing family have been buried here,

47
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:08,212
hidden in the darkness
behind closed doors.

48
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,949
I think there's a story here,
waiting to be told.

49
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:14,717
And that's why I'm here.

50
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,353
<i>Welcome back!</i>

51
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,256
<i>You're listening to 94.9,</i>

52
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,425
<i>Witching Season Radio!</i>

53
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,795
<i>Midnight is here,
you know what that means?</i>

54
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:00,864
<i>Halloween is officially upon us!</i>

55
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,468
<i>The veil is thin and the world
of the dead and living</i>

56
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,171
<i>are almost interchangeable.</i>

57
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:09,206
<i>To celebrate, stick with me</i>

58
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,443
<i>as we broadcast
for the next 24 hours.</i>

59
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,107
Hello?

60
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:42,099
I'm here at the,
the Booth House.

61
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,837
This place is exactly
as I pictured it would be.

62
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:53,844
Doesn't look
like anyone is here.

63
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,625
Everything is covered in sheets.

64
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:26,270
It's a locked door.

65
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:30,974
Maybe it leads to the basement?

66
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,549
Hello?

67
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,460
Jesus.

68
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,293
I found the study.

69
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,464
And a really nice writing desk.

70
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:46,104
And of course I already broke
something so, there's that.

71
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,606
- God, Dani!
- Dad!

72
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:25,810
What's your problem?

73
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,277
I thought you were asleep.

74
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,596
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

75
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,339
What the hell?

76
00:15:57,274 --> 00:15:58,208
Watch your mouth.

77
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:00,477
You say it all the time.

78
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:09,821
So I thought
someone was meeting us here?

79
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:14,759
You know, uh...

80
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:18,395
you don't even worry about it,
we're good to go.

81
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,342
Where the hell
is the thermostat?

82
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,012
Watch your mouth.

83
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,851
So what's in there?

84
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,921
Oh, uh, ghosts.

85
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:46,958
There're ghosts?

86
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,394
No.

87
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,729
They're
the friendly ghosts, okay?

88
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:54,664
So, so, they're like the...

89
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:58,468
what's that dumb...
like, they're like the Casper,

90
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:01,404
they're, they're friendly, they're
not going to, they're not going to...

91
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,675
There's no ghosts,
alright? I'm...

92
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:06,610
So...

93
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,312
I was... it was just a...

94
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:10,413
God, damn it.

95
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:17,554
Wow.

96
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:22,459
Looks like the one
Grandma and Grandpa gave us.

97
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:45,983
Dad.

98
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:48,485
No. Stop it!

99
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:14,045
<i>When that school
bell rings tomorrow at 2:30,</i>

100
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:17,647
- <i>officially Halloween has begun.</i>
- Alright, here we go.

101
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,050
<i>This year,
with Halloween landing...</i>

102
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,085
I don't want to watch TV.

103
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,120
- <i>...officials have urged...</i>
- Why?

104
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:25,056
They always have
the best stuff on in October.

105
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,457
- <i>...children. This is...</i>
- <i>Hey folks, come on down</i>

106
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,093
<i>to McKade's Pumpkin Patch
and Corn Maze!</i>

107
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,594
<i>There's still
plenty of time to pick up</i>

108
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:31,996
<i>your Halloween Jack O'Lantern!</i>

109
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,764
<i>And, of course,
if you stay after dark,</i>

110
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,399
<i>the corn maze becomes
the "Haunted Corn Maze."</i>

111
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,177
<i>Hey,
where do you want me to come out from?</i>

112
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,778
- <i>Uh, just...</i>
- <i>They super glued the coffin lid up.</i>

113
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:49,113
<i>Just the curtain
and the coffin right...</i>

114
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:50,147
See?

115
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:53,516
- <i>Here?</i>
- <i>No, no, no, other side of the coffin.</i>

116
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,553
<i>Yeah, but,
I'll knock shit over if I come out here.</i>

117
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:59,723
- <i>No, the right... Your right side of the coffin.</i>
- <i>Oh, here?</i>

118
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:01,158
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Okay, got it.</i>

119
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,894
- This is lame.
- <i>Welcome everyone</i>

120
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,594
<i>to "Count Spookula's Horrific...</i>

121
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:06,998
- It's not lame, it's Spookula.
- <i>...Spookula...</i>

122
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:08,833
- <i>...be your host tonight...</i>
- He is lame.

123
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:09,934
<i>...and take you
through a journey...</i>

124
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,468
Ah, come on, he is great.

125
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:13,503
I, I grew up
watching this, okay?

126
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,072
- Me and your mo...
- <i>We've got professional,</i>

127
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:17,808
<i>we've got semi-professional,</i>

128
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:19,542
- <i>and we've got...</i>
- It's Spookula.

129
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,778
It's, it's not bad.

130
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,880
<i>...Todd made last week.</i>

131
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:25,415
<i>Okay, Count, just,
just stick to the script, okay?</i>

132
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:29,987
- What are we doing here?
- <i>You told me to promote local films,</i>

133
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:31,756
- <i>I'm promoting local films.</i>
- <i>Yeah, but...</i>

134
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,858
<i>Todd worked his ass off!</i>

135
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:37,161
Came for work, sweetie.
You know that.

136
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:41,165
But why here?

137
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:42,732
In this house.

138
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,509
You know, sometimes it's...

139
00:19:56,914 --> 00:19:58,515
Sometimes it's hard for...

140
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:00,918
for people to...

141
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,089
for me, to be creative.

142
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,059
And I guess that's everyone,
it's hard,

143
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,027
it's hard
for anyone to be creative...

144
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:14,799
after something
bad has happened.

145
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:19,971
I find that, uh...

146
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:25,910
that sometimes
a change of scenery,

147
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:26,844
uh...

148
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,215
doing something new, can help.

149
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:41,125
And I guess I figured
that it would be good for me.

150
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,059
I mean...

151
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,161
good for us.

152
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,865
With everything that's going on.

153
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,675
Sweetheart, I know that...

154
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:10,988
I know this isn't what you want.

155
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,966
Maybe when we're done though, I...
we can go camping or something?

156
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,667
Really?

157
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,037
Yeah.

158
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,570
Go up to the lake?

159
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:29,040
- Yes!

Are you okay here for a minute?
I got to make a phone call.

162
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:41,152
- Mm-hmm.

Yeah, hi. Uh, it's me, um...

Probably not, no.

242

Mom always took me
trick or treating.

Okay, look.

But, let me get through that,

01:03:01,465 --> 01:03:04,769
What do I spend my days
doing Dani? Huh?

323
01:03:04,802 --> 01:03:07,839
I spend my days carrying you
from one spot to another,

324
01:03:07,872 --> 01:03:09,807
cooking for you, feeding you.

325
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:15,145
Do you realize that you're
not the only one who lost her?

326
01:03:15,178 --> 01:03:16,480
Like,
does that even occur to you?

327
01:03:16,513 --> 01:03:18,515
That maybe you're
the reason she's gone.

328
01:03:19,884 --> 01:03:22,553
And now I'm the one
who gets to carry you around,

329
01:03:22,586 --> 01:03:24,856
I'm the one who gets
to clean you and dress you,

330
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:27,624
and take care of you all day!

331
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:35,299
I'm sorry.

332
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:41,773
No. I'm sorry.

333
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:44,809
Okay? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

334
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:58,288
This is me.
This is on me. Not you.

335
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:05,262
The shortcomings we have as
a family are not your fault.

336
01:04:05,295 --> 01:04:07,164
It's my failure as your dad.

337
01:04:08,231 --> 01:04:09,299
All of this was...

338
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:13,805
just me trying
and, like usually,

339
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:15,472
I couldn't do it right.

340
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,647
Okay? I love you, Dani, so much
and I'm, I'm sorry for...

341
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:27,250
for what I put you through.

342
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:29,252
This place...

343
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:31,789
it's not good for us.

344
01:04:37,227 --> 01:04:38,695
It's just time we go home.

345
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,334
Are you okay?

346
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:47,604
I got to go pee.

347
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:37,287
Hey, Dani.

348
01:05:39,656 --> 01:05:41,458
- Dani.
- What?

349
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,927
Hey, you almost done?

350
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,661
In a minute.

351
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:47,698
Okay. I'll be ready
in just a few minutes, okay?

352
01:05:47,731 --> 01:05:48,632
Okay.

353
01:06:20,932 --> 01:06:22,934
<i>I know what you're looking for.</i>

354
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,339
<i>It's in this house.</i>

355
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:13,104
Jesus.

356
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:32,823
Dani?

357
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,441
Dani!

358
01:09:54,912 --> 01:09:55,813
Dani!

359
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:14,564
Dani!

360
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:40,985
Dani.

361
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,244
Dani!

362
01:12:57,428 --> 01:12:59,330
<i>Every house has a story.</i>

363
01:13:00,431 --> 01:13:04,034
<i>A story that lives inside it,</i>

364
01:13:04,068 --> 01:13:05,769
<i>like a memory in a brain.</i>

365

369
01:13:20,918 --> 01:13:25,222
<i>But in some places,
these stories are never quite finished,</i>

370
01:13:25,256 --> 01:13:29,760
<i>leaving the spirits to wander
aimlessly like a spinning wheel.</i>

01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:31,862

372
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:34,798

377
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:50,080
<i>I think there's a story here, waiting to be told.</i>

378
01:14:55,846 --> 01:14:56,880
Oh, shit!

379
01:17:35,506 --> 01:17:36,473
Is this a dream?

380
01:17:42,513 --> 01:17:43,680
It has to be a dream.

381
01:17:47,117 --> 01:17:48,385
Ho... how do I wake up?

382
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:52,389
Does this feel like a dream?

383
01:17:54,992 --> 01:17:55,894
This can't be real.

384
01:17:57,528 --> 01:18:00,230
None of this, it can't be real,
it just...

385
01:18:06,737 --> 01:18:08,071
How do I wake up?

386
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:12,142
This is still your story.

387
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,580
You've got to finish
what you've started.

388
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:23,053
There is no story.

389
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:31,195
I lost her.

390
01:18:34,364 --> 01:18:36,467
I can't get out,
I don't know how to get out.

391
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:39,970
I don't know where to go.

392
01:18:43,607 --> 01:18:44,975
I lost Dani.

393
01:18:46,076 --> 01:18:48,512
I lost Dani. I don't know,
I've looked everywhere.

394
01:19:22,446 --> 01:19:23,680
What happened here?

395
01:22:34,839 --> 01:22:35,940
Welcome back.

396
01:22:40,044 --> 01:22:41,278
What did you say?

397
01:22:47,051 --> 01:22:48,418
She's not here.

398
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,729
- Who?
- Who you think?

399
01:22:58,763 --> 01:23:00,430
Little one, the girl, Dani.

400
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:05,402
How do you know her name?

401
01:23:07,772 --> 01:23:10,775
Do you ever get tired
of doing the same thing

402
01:23:10,808 --> 01:23:12,877
over and over and over?

403
01:23:15,545 --> 01:23:17,314
Where is she?

404
01:23:20,317 --> 01:23:22,787
- She took her.
- Who?

405
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,788
Who took her?

406
01:23:25,823 --> 01:23:27,925
The bitch from your story.

407
01:23:27,959 --> 01:23:30,393
The one who
always gets away over again.

408
01:23:32,997 --> 01:23:34,598
Where are they?

409
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:39,036
That's, that's pretty funny.

410
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:41,605
Where?

411
01:23:46,643 --> 01:23:47,577
Well...

412
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,680
I guess it's time
for you to die again.

413
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:55,219
Jesus Christ!

414
01:28:58,756 --> 01:28:59,656
Dani!

415
01:29:03,027 --> 01:29:05,362
No, no, no, no, no...

416
01:29:08,099 --> 01:29:08,999
God. Listen.

417
01:30:55,806 --> 01:30:56,974
You found her.

418
01:31:00,077 --> 01:31:00,978
What?

419
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:11,956
Isn't she beautiful?

420
01:31:16,193 --> 01:31:17,094
You.

421
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:21,031
You did this.

422
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:23,733
Yeah.

423
01:31:32,142 --> 01:31:34,111
Now, now you're free.

424
01:31:56,467 --> 01:31:57,368
No.

425
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:02,239
No, don't, don't be upset.
No, I did this for us.

426
01:32:03,974 --> 01:32:06,277
Oh, it's okay.

427
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:08,946
No, it's okay.

428
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:11,215
It's okay, it's okay.

429
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,384
It's okay.

430
01:33:54,952 --> 01:33:56,320
Jesus Christ.

431
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,211
<i>911 emergency.</i>

432
01:34:23,313 --> 01:34:24,214
<i>Hello?</i>

433
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:27,418
<i>Is there someone on the line?</i>

434
01:34:31,555 --> 01:34:32,456
<i>Hello?</i>

435
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:36,160
They're both dead.

436
01:34:38,362 --> 01:34:39,363
<i>Who is dead, sir?</i>

437
01:34:41,031 --> 01:34:44,001
Yes, they're,
they're both dead. I...

438
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:50,040
<i>Okay, sir. I'm going to need you
to answer some questions.</i>

439
01:34:50,073 --> 01:34:51,442
<i>Can you start
from the beginning?</i>

440
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,414
The beginning?

441
01:35:11,728 --> 01:35:13,130
I was away.

442
01:35:14,331 --> 01:35:16,700
For work, on a trip.

443
01:35:19,336 --> 01:35:22,473
Try... trying to...
trying to finish my story.

444
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:30,714
I left Dani alone with Cynthia.

445
01:35:35,753 --> 01:35:38,589
I should... should've,
should've been there.

446
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:42,192
Sho... should've...

447
01:35:42,226 --> 01:35:44,127
Shou... should've been there
for both of them.

448
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:50,334
When I came home...

449
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:55,005
I found Dani dead.

450
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:01,078
Cynthia drowned her in the tub.

451
01:36:09,286 --> 01:36:10,554
Cynthia...

452
01:36:10,587 --> 01:36:12,389
So I came down the downstairs...

453
01:36:13,557 --> 01:36:15,058
and I stabbed her to death.

454
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:20,497
I just stabbed her...
