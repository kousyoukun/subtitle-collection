[ominous music]

11
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,935
You know, a family used to live
here a while back, right?

12
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,037
Yeah, I heard they went missing.

13
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,906
Because of the curse.

14
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:42,974
What curse?

15
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:47,178
A witch used to live here, man.
Now this place is cursed.

16
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,646
Wait,
you haven't heard about this?

17
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:54,752
Well, she and her daughter lived
here when this place was first built.

18
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,021
When her daughter died,
she was blamed for it.

19
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,156
They say, she locked
herself in the basement,

20
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,125
and eventually,
she killed herself.

21
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,995
[grunts] Dude, no.
That's not even close to what I heard.

22
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:07,664
I heard the guy who used to live
here, Mr. Booth, was a monster.

23
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,233
He went crazy,
killed his whole family,

24
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,500
and then shot himself.

25
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,671
Yeah, but what about the bodies?
The bodies were never found.

26
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:17,008
They say, he hid the bodies
somewhere inside the house,

27
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,909
that's why their ghosts
are stuck here.

28
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,679
I guess no one
really knows, then.

29
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:23,646
Yeah.

Why you're always such a wuss?

39

You always say you want
to do something scary,

<i>Every house has a story.</i>

658
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:50,007
<i>A story that lives inside it,</i>

659
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:51,541
<i>like a memory in a brain.</i>

660
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:55,579
<i>The characters
of these stories are the ghosts</i>

661
01:39:55,612 --> 01:39:58,015
<i>of the people who once
inhabited these places.</i>

662
01:39:59,382 --> 01:40:02,385
<i>Who lived out their narratives
only to forget</i>

663
01:40:02,419 --> 01:40:04,789
<i>and be forgotten
by the passage of time.</i>

664
01:40:06,924 --> 01:40:11,328
<i>But in some places,
these stories are never quite finished,</i>

665
01:40:11,361 --> 01:40:15,665
<i>leaving the spirits to wander
aimlessly like a spinning wheel.</i>

666
01:40:16,934 --> 01:40:17,969
<i>And I think...</i>

667
01:40:19,203 --> 01:40:20,872
<i>that's what's been going on
at the Booth House</i>

668
01:40:20,905 --> 01:40:22,439
<i>for the last 30 years.</i>

669
01:40:23,707 --> 01:40:25,709
<i>The horrors that happened
to the missing family</i>

670
01:40:25,742 --> 01:40:28,045
<i>have been buried here,</i>

671
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:30,815
<i>hidden in the darkness
behind closed doors.</i>

672
01:40:31,816 --> 01:40:35,519
<i>I think there's a story here,
waiting to be told.</i>

673
01:40:37,054 --> 01:40:38,488
<i>And that's why I'm here.</i>

674
01:40:40,657 --> 01:40:42,692
