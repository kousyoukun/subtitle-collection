1
00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:02,906
(static humming)

2
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:05,989
(tone reverberating)

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:11,199
(electronic tone twanging)

4
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:21,496
(birds chirping)

5
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:24,579
(car doors clunking)

6
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,952
(engine revving)

7
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:36,808
- I was calling to find out about,

8
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:37,987
I believe it was Detective Purvis

9
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,575
that came out and spoke with Candy.

10
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,641
I was wondering if you knew whether there

11
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,037
had been any warrants
issued for (bleeping).

12
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,729
Mm-hmm, no, he knows where
the shelter is, here.

13
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,577
He told her, "I know where the shelter is,

14
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:53,084
"I know how to find, I
know where to find you."

15
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:54,589
This is pretty serious.

16
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,672
(car engine passing)

17
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,422
- Even though I choose to by
around him, when I shouldn't.

18
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:04,801
And I know that I shouldn't,
but it's only because

19
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,975
of the fact that I'm scared.

20
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:11,142
And I feel like if I don't
do anything he asks of me,

21
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:17,550
like come when he calls, or
stop everything I'm doing

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,883
just to be there, that he would hurt me.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,760
(keyboard clacking)

24
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:29,528
(door hinge squeaking)

25
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:34,177
- So what, tell me what just happened?

26
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,472
- He text me, he's saying
he's on his way to Clapp's.

27
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,114
Car wash, here in Pittsboro.
- Here?

28
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:44,523
Alright, I'm gonna call
Ed right now and tell him.

29
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:45,372
Okay?
- 'Kay.

30
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,451
- You okay with that?

31
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:50,528
- So-so, I guess, I don't
want to involve the law,

32
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,537
but he just needs to leave me alone.

33
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:54,225
- You understand that
that's not gonna happen

34
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:57,019
unless law enforcement intervenes.

35
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,749
- Yeah.
- To make it stop.

36
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:02,082
- Hey, Buddy, I have a question for you.

37
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:06,302
One of the residents at the shelter,

38
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:10,818
her abuser keeps calling
her on her cell phone.

39
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,500
She was gonna text him back,
and say, "Where are you?"

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,977
And then call the Pittsboro PD and say,

41
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,357
"Here's where he says he is."

42
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:21,024
Is that some kind of entrapment?

43
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:24,935
Not entrapment.

44
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,440
- Now you do it, baby,
how 'bout text him back

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,113
and say, "Where are you at?"

46
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:30,640
Where are you at, okay, good.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,379
Let's see how long it takes.
- Okay.

48
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,614
-  Oh, oh, here we go.

49
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:40,947
- Just left Elizabeth's Pizza.
- Alright.

50
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,697
- Hey, he just texted her and said he just

51
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:50,101
left Elizabeth's Pizza.
(camera shutter clicking)

52
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,649
Do you want to text him back and say,

53
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:55,072
"I will me you at
Clapp's in five minutes."

54
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,655
- Okay.
- She's texting him now.

55
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,102
- Police everywhere.

56
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,274
-  He said,
"Police is everywhere."

57
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:05,857
That's what he, so.
- Oh my god.

58
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:11,549
-  Swarm me, did you do this?

59
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:12,825
(Kit gasping)

60
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,183
- He just texted her and said,
"Swarm me, did you do this?"

61
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:17,742
Did they get him?

62
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:20,380
That's what he, he just,
- License check.

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,047
- Oh, he was in a license check.

64
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,438
If they just did a fucking
license check, why?

65
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,467
-  It should be in the system, so.

66
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,634
- On my way to Al's Diner.

67
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,165
He's on his way to Al's.

68
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,579
- He says, "On my way to Al's Diners."

69
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,420
Tell him, be there in five, you text,

70
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,587
be there in five minutes.

71
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,832
- Okay.
(buttons clicking)

72
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,318
- Alright, alright, bye.
- Are they gonna go get him?

73
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,994
- Yeah, he said just be
vigilant and keep documenting.

74
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:03,494
(Candy sobbing intensely)

75
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:14,089
- It's not your fault.

76
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,428
You know, it's not your fault.

77
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:24,595
His choices and the things that
he did are what caused this.

78
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,355
Okay? I did it.

79
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,688
I made the call.

80
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:35,553
I did it, okay?

81
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:43,879
(cell phone ringing)

82
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:49,125
- This is Ed, hello?

83
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:58,054
Right next door, not
right up from the shelter?

85
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,184
- Salisbury?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,786
- That's a half block from here.

87
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:03,875
Less than half a block.
- Ed thinks

88
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,625
that's where he's at.

89
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:10,496
Check to see where she is.

90
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,734
Oh my god.

91
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,805
Oh my god, please, please, please, please.

92
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,305
Woo, yes, oh yeah!

93
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,119
Oh, thank you, Ed.

94
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,482
You sure they got him?

95
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,469
Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.

96
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,375
Thank you, I hope they set his
bond high enough to where he

97
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,542
can't get out, 'cause he
is gonna be one pissed off.

98
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:53,962
Thanks (laughing emotionally).

99
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:56,336
Yes, I'm so happy!

100
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:02,733
Whew.
(door creaking)

101
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,503
(Kit clapping)
(advocates cheering)

102
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:06,503
- Woo!
- Yay.

103
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,915
(Candy sobbing)

104
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,415
-  It's okay.

105
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:25,354
- You alright, sweetie?
- Yeah, I'm good.

106
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:26,854
-  It's okay.

107
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,157
-  It's so hard.

108
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:34,624
-  Yes, it's hard.

109
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,791
Yes it is, it's very hard.

110
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,256
-  I feel like it's my fault.

111
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,676
-  It's not your fault.

112
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,426
It is not your fault.

113
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,553
You didn't make him who he is.

114
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:49,886
If it wasn't you, it'd be somebody else.

115
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:56,258
- It's Charlotte Talks on
listener-funded 90.7 WFAE

116
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:58,903
and 90.3 WFHE, I'm Mike Collins.

117
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:00,761
We're talking about domestic violence.

118
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,016
Kit Gruelle is also a
survivor, so she has worked

119
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:05,922
with California POST, that
state's effort to train

120
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:09,234
law enforcement officers to
deal with domestic violence.

121
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:12,191
And she is known nationally as an advocate

122
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,562
and community educator on this topic.

123
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,522
And you brought a stack of files here.

124
00:07:16,522 --> 00:07:18,261
- These are all restraining orders

125
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,790
from one year in North Carolina.

126
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,287
Now these are not all
the restraining orders

127
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:24,577
that were issued, there's
probably 45 or 50 orders here.

128
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,679
And every single one of the
women who went to obtain

129
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,157
these orders of protection was murdered.

130
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,834
In precisely the ways that
they said they were gonna be.

131
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,924
So I sometimes refer to restraining orders

132
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:37,619
as the Last Will and Testament.

133
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:41,530
Because battered women are the
experts in what's happening

134
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,215
in their relationship, and
we need, society, we need

135
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,518
to treat them like the
experts that they are.

136
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:49,856
When she says, "He's going to kill me."

137
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:51,500
Or, "He's going to kill my family."

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,775
Or, "He's going to kill my
cousin if he can't get to me."

139
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,390
We have got to step on
the brakes and slow down

140
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,358
and take that whole thing seriously.

141
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,759
And then, when there's a
restraining order violation,

142
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,900
our judicial officials
have to understand that he

143
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,926
is showing contempt for the court system.

144
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:11,917
And he truly is a risk to her
and to community at large.

145
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:16,542
- If you're not being hit, if
you're not being threatened

146
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,882
with a knife, or some kind of a weapon.

147
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,891
If it's just words, if it's intimidation,

148
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:25,266
if it is belittling,
how do you recognize it?

149
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,694
How do others recognize it?

150
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:31,624
How do you then get others
to say, to help you stop it?

151
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,729
- When I do the hostage
negotiations class, this is one

152
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,471
of the things that I bring
up with the negotiators.

153
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,998
My late husband was a
freak about food intake.

154
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,249
He was trying to gain muscle weight,

155
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:44,675
so he wanted a lot of protein calories.

156
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:48,508
And so every night before he went out,

157
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:51,430
he wanted a bowl of ice
cream, and on the ice cream,

158
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,628
he wanted peanuts, because
peanuts are so high in protein.

159
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,257
So when I went to grocery store,

160
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:59,157
I had to buy salted peanuts.

161
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:02,112
Put them in a colander, rinse
them off and pat them dry.

162
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:05,726
And put the rinsed-off
peanuts on the ice cream.

163
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:08,185
And while he was eating his
ice cream, if he came across

164
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:10,948
salt on the peanuts, he would
beat me up, because he said

165
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,501
I didn't do a good enough
job washing the peanuts.

166
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,933
So when I go out and do the
negotiations class, I say to

167
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,540
these cops, what happens
when you show up on the scene

168
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,863
and you get her out there in
the back of the patrol car,

169
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,239
and she's saying to you over
and over and over again,

170
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,843
"I should have done a better
job washing the peanuts."

171
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,549
And when women say stuff like that,

172
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:29,713
it's not because they're crazy,

173
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:31,518
it's because the way
they're really living.

174
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:34,518
(slow guitar music)

175
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,721
Our criminal justice system requires

176
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:53,721
that she be beaten enough
to satisfy the system.

177
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,234
And by the time it gets to that point,

178
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:01,260
she's already been so worn
down, psychologically,

179
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,983
and physically and emotionally,
that's when it's really

180
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,353
time for advocates to really step up.

181
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:09,590
And begin to treat her
like she has some value.

182
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,190
Because she's been told now,
systemically, that she doesn't.

183
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,368
The courts have told her
that she doesn't have value.

184
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,122
And her partner has told her
that she doesn't have value.

185
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,251
Perhaps family and friends have done that

186
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,095
through their actions with her.

187
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:23,758
And all that strips away from her.

188
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,622
So I think another thing
that advocates do is,

189
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:29,789
instead of stripping away,
we try to build back up.

190
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:42,814
You know, a lot of times
battered women leave.

191
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:45,526
Four or five, six, seven, eight times.

192
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:47,982
And people start to get tired of it.

193
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:51,265
They see a woman leave an
abuser and then go back.

194
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,384
It's complicated.

195
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:58,199
Leaving an abuser is not
an event, it's a process.

196
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,346
And this is where advocates come in.

197
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,643
It's not our job to say to
her, "We're gonna be your

198
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:05,244
"advocate, when you leave the
first time, when you leave

199
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,025
"the second time, when
you leave the third time.

200
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:07,897
"But on that fourth time,

201
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,131
"we're not working with you anymore."

202
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:12,167
That's not how it goes.

203
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,643
If we're going to be effective
advocates, we're going

204
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:18,027
to recognize that each
woman's case is unique.

205
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,552
And each woman's case is special.

206
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,070
Anybody have any experiences
with the boyfriend

207
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,120
or the husband?

208
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,746
You've had that experience.

209
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:29,579
- It went on for nine years.
- Wow.

210
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:36,037
- I went back, I left and
went back three times.

211
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:37,954
And I won't, this time.

212
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:43,419
And this last time, he almost killed me

213
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,007
in front of my daughter.

214
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,590
And now I have had 23 seizures,

215
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,112
and my daughter has seen

216
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,695
every one of them and
she takes care of me.

217
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,736
- But what happened to
you shouldn't happen

218
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,171
to anybody, ever.

219
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,338
- I know that and that's
why I'm here (sniffling).

220
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:11,278
- What do your parents
have to say about it?

221
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,611
- Why didn't you just leave?

222
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,610
- Did he ever threaten to kill you?

223
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,443
- Yeah, lots of times.

224
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:24,444
My mom called the police
officers, and one of the officers

225
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,861
said that he knew my husband.

226
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:31,005
And that he knew he was violent person.

227
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:35,132
But he wasn't violent
enough to kill someone.

228
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:39,299
They came, I filed charges for
the abuse that I went through

229
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:43,899
because it happened in another state.

230
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,843
So I'm left to just live with it.

231
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,869
(tense music)

232
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,667
- It's very hard in Deanna's
case, to see a woman get so

233
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:22,684
hideously beaten and then,
essentially, to have the local

234
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:26,170
courts say, "Well, we're
sorry that happened to you,

235
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,845
"but we're really, we're
just gonna let it go."

236
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,815
We just can't let this go.

237
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:33,898
Something has to be done.

238
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,733
I do this work because

239
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,535
I survived a really violent relationship.

240
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:45,532
Jack punched me really hard in the face.

241
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:48,004
One time, punched me like I was a man.

242
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:51,981
And it was the whole thing,
with doing flips off the porch,

243
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:56,586
and seeing stars and birdies,
and I remember thinking,

244
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,971
wow, this is, it's
really like the cartoons.

245
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,574
And for four days, I stayed on the couch,

246
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,714
with a blanket pulled up over my face.

247
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:05,993
Because I didn't want the boys to see me,

248
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,098
because I looked so bad.

249
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,181
But then, I couldn't eat,

250
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:14,615
and I was having a hard
time even swallowing stuff,

251
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,769
so I knew that I needed
to get it looked at.

252
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,478
And Jack drove me down to see my OB/GYN.

253
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:25,343
And he walked in the room
and looked at my face,

254
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:27,493
and immediately looked away.

255
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,410
And I just remember feeling sort of

256
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:34,162
a whole new layer of isolation,

257
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,539
because my doctor wouldn't
look me in the eye

258
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,206
and say, "What happened to you?"

259
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,195
- Alright, so I got one on my
face, where you slapped at me.

260
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,190
Okay, so we were going at it.
- Wait, does that make sense

261
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,753
though, let's think about this.

262
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,216
- Let me see.
- This.

263
00:14:57,216 --> 00:15:00,966
- You scare me.
- Okay, alright, that'll work.

264
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,926
Are you, okay, you want
me to do this again?

265
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:05,176
- You need some more, yeah.

266
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:12,456
(knocking on door)

267
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,677
-  I don't know why
you always gotta be thinking

268
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,625
I'm cheating on you.

269
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,361
- Well, what was that phone number?

270
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,002
(knocking on door)
- Who cares what the phone

271
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,024
number was, you ain't got
no business going through my

272
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,219
damn phone to begin with.
- I don't care, why don't,

273
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:23,636
stop it, stop it.

274
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:26,146
(thudding loudly)

275
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:26,979
- It's just some girl
that lives down here,

276
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,503
- Who is that person, you're not supposed

277
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,698
to be seeing someone.
- Come on, Kit, shut up.

278
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:30,781
Just shut up.

279
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,886
What?
- How you doing today, sir?

280
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:34,765
- I'm alright.

281
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:38,889
- Is it alright if I come
in and take a look inside?

282
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,968
Mind if we talk to y'all separately?

283
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:42,982
- No, that's fine, or you can talk

284
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:44,417
to us together.
- Alright.

285
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:48,084
- Pardon me, sir, can
I talk to you outside?

286
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,154
- Yeah, sure.

287
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,693
- How are you doing, Ma'am?

288
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,576
- Have you seen the way he looked at me?

289
00:15:58,576 --> 00:15:59,704
(training officer drowned out by crashing)

290
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:00,537
- What uh,

291
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:01,881
- Did you see the way
he just looked at me?

292
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,994
- Yes, ma'am, what seems to be going on?

293
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:07,494
- She starts flipping out, she's bi-polar,

294
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,693
I mean, she's got her issues.

295
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,809
And when she gets that way,
she gets really physical,

296
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,087
and everything, she's scratched me.

297
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,681
- He grabbed me by the throat.

298
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,181
- Do you have any marks or anything?

299
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:21,683
- I don't know if I do
or not, I don't know.

300
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:25,780
- Have you considered
trying staying somewhere?

301
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,731
Over the night, seeing if it'll cool down?

302
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:32,448
- Mm, what's going on?
- Nothing, just finished up

303
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:34,015
my getting his statement.

304
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:35,555
So maybe it's play it safer,

305
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:36,830
just split them up for the night.

306
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,113
- Yeah.
- Come back in the morning.

307
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,996
- Yeah.
- See if we can't make

308
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:43,405
heads or tails of this,
who's lying, who's not.

309
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,676
- Thought they were done.

310
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:47,325
It's always police shit.

311
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,329
(Kit laughing)

312
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:52,049
- You're a good roller.
- Yeah, I know.

313
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:54,137
- As far as the whole,
splittin' them up, or taking one

314
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:57,065
of them to jail, I mean, what
should have been the call?

315
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:59,768
- You've got injuries on her neck.

316
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,065
Hers are more serious than mine.

317
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:05,347
Mine look like they
could be defensive marks.

318
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:07,644
You're probably walking away
from here with me in cuffs,

319
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:08,477
at that point.

320
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:09,920
- Since we couldn't establish
the primary aggressor,

321
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,421
we figured we'd err on the side of caution

322
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,781
and just split you up for the night.

323
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:15,647
- How do you feel like they did?

324
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,343
- I think you did fine.

325
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:20,241
One thing that, when we
was walking out the door,

326
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,872
didn't I say to you, "Did
you see how he looked at me?"

327
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:25,997
- I did.
- But, like he could,

328
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,741
Or she could.
- That was not so subtle.

329
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:32,024
- One of the other can,
- I saw you glance back,

330
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,397
especially when we came in.
- Oh, it was about

331
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:36,168
a five second stare, before
I walked out the door.

332
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,663
Basically, giving her notice.

333
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:39,025
- So what does he want to do?

334
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,927
What does this abuser want to do?

335
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,225
He wants to maintain
control over the situation.

336
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:45,567
So he's gonna have a
variety of different tactics

337
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:49,204
that he's gonna use, some
won't be obvious at all.

338
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:51,632
Some will be things like
the look, or maybe the way

339
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:54,150
he closes the door a little
bit harder, things like that.

340
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,861
And these are things
that she'll key off of,

341
00:17:56,861 --> 00:18:00,412
he'll key off of, but I just ask y'all

342
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,060
to keep your eyes and ears open.

343
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,305
Because there could be
behaviors like that,

344
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:06,305
that will shut her down.

345
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,792
(slow guitar music)

346
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,023
(door creaking)

347
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,190
- Hello.
- Hey.

348
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:38,178
- Hello.
- Hello.

349
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:41,960
- How do you feel about telling people

350
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,479
about what happened in your case?

351
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,204
- Oh, it doesn't bother me too much.

352
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:48,871
- Mm-hmm.
- I feel like it helps.

353
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,022
- So let's start at the beginning.

354
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:56,225
What was it like when you
all first started dating?

355
00:18:56,225 --> 00:19:00,142
- For the first two
months, he was really sweet

356
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:06,259
and nice, and then he kinda questioned

357
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:10,560
what I had done in the past.

358
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,940
And wanted to know who my friends were

359
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,273
and what I'd done with them.

360
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:20,538
And then, it started from there.

361
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,274
- This is Robbie?

362
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:25,941
- Yes, and that's
Martina's first Halloween.

363
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:32,560
On Halloween, he told me that I had to go

364
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,385
with him on his trucking trip.

365
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:38,718
And I told him no, that I had to work.

366
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,968
And he said I was gonna go,

367
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,913
that he wasn't gonna leave
me there to cheat on him.

368
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,913
And so he made me go and

369
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:55,642
when we got in Tennessee is
when he started beating me.

370
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:01,928
Martina, just, she
asked him over and over,

371
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:05,246
"Why are you doing it to my,
why are you hurting my mama?"

372
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,753
And he would tell her,
"She doesn't love you,

373
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:12,429
"and she doesn't love me,
it's okay to hurt Mommy."

374
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,846
And he would hit me with the flash light.

375
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,617
He hit me in the head, on
the shoulders, the elbows.

376
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:25,871
He would hit my knees so
hard that I could hardly

377
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:28,399
bend my legs.
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:32,524
- He would put, while he was
beating me, there was a little

379
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:36,607
mirror, about that big,
on the side of the truck.

380
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:42,339
And he would hit me, and
then he get me by the hair,

381
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,876
and pull me up and make
me look in that mirror

382
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,016
and ask me if it was worth it.

383
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:51,906
We stopped at one truck stop
to get him some meatballs.

384
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:55,214
And Martina said she wanted some.

385
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,286
And he said, "No, you can't have some

386
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,375
"until your mommy tells me the truth."

387
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,283
And he said, "And you can tell your mommy

388
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:06,360
to tell me the truth if you want some."

389
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,162
And so she started crying,
because she was really hungry,

390
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:13,493
and she told me to tell
her daddy the truth.

391
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:17,769
And I told her that I
had, and she was screaming

392
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:21,216
and begging me,"Please
tell Daddy the truth."

393
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:22,966
And that was so hard.

394
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,641
Robbie got one of them out of the pack,

395
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:30,367
and he looked at Martina,
and he held it in her face,

396
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:32,942
and he said, "Look, this
is gonna be so good."

397
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:35,628
And he took a bite of it and
was going, "Mmm, Martina,

398
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,636
"this is so good, and
just think, if your mommy

399
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:41,313
"had told me the truth,
you could had some."

400
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,418
It was just all I could take.

401
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:48,152
And I grabbed the flashlight,
and I was just gonna beat it.

402
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:50,625
I just couldn't stand
it, and I was just bound

403
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,368
and determined I was gonna beat him.

404
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,708
And when he saw me grab the flashlight,

405
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,604
he dropped the meatballs.

406
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,937
And when he did,

407
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:05,427
I grabbed the meatballs
and let him beat me

408
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:10,157
with the flashlight and while
I fed the meatballs to her.

409
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:13,216
And I didn't care how hard he hit me.

410
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:15,830
As long as she got those meatballs.

411
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,754
I didn't care, the whole time
that I fed those meatballs

412
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,587
to her, he hit me that flashlight.

413
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,371
And I could feel my knees
swelling, it was so hard

414
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:31,251
to hold on to them, but I
was bound and determined

415
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,834
that I was going to, and I did.

416
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,933
I wasn't gonna let my baby
starve because of him.

417
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:44,164
- He wasn't arrested until,
when was it, November 9th?

418
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:50,321
The charges were just
filed, assault on a female.

419
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:53,091
I just felt like why wasn't
there attempted murder?

420
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:54,583
- Mm-hmm.
- Deanna and I had met with

421
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,354
That DA, I think a week
or two before that.

422
00:22:58,354 --> 00:22:59,978
- Mm-hmm.
- And he had told us

423
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,984
that she didn't have a very strong case.

424
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:04,524
Because most of her stuff
happened out of state.

425
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:07,684
The DA said that the Grand
Jury would ask Deanna why she

426
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:12,155
left, what was her reason
for leaving the county him?

427
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:14,965
Because at first, it was willing,

428
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:17,491
they would say she left willingly.

429
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:19,472
It was after she left North Carolina

430
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,984
that the beatings start.

431
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,012
So that they would completely
just turn back on her.

432
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,055
- Mm-hmm.
- And, basically,

433
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,601
he was gonna get off, on a state level,

434
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:30,962
for what had happened to her.

435
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:33,379
(slow music)

436
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:46,266
- I've seen cases like
this over and over again.

437
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,643
Where women are severely
beaten, sometimes shot,

438
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:51,330
and sometimes stabbed, and
the offender is charged

439
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,114
with assault on a female, or
assault with a deadly weapon.

440
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:57,871
Both charges charged as misdemeanors.

441
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:02,038
But we have a law on the books
that says that if you steal

442
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,993
a bale of pine straw, that's a felony.

443
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:08,740
Despite the fact that we'd
like to think that those laws

444
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,907
are outdated, the belief
systems behind those laws

445
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,256
are still very much a part
of the way things get played

446
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,816
out in court every day,
across the country.

447
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:23,816
(slow guitar music)

448
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,314
- So, it's kind of busy today.

449
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:43,272
- It is, this this an extremely busy day.

450
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:44,808
-  They're bringing
the guy over from jail.

451
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:46,994
- That's this one.
- Is that for

452
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:48,464
a restraining order violation?

453
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:51,259
- He was arrested for the same
incident that she took out

454
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,465
the DVP for.
- Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

455
00:24:53,465 --> 00:24:57,432
- Yes, sir.
- I met with the DA's office

456
00:24:57,432 --> 00:24:59,515
down the security report.

457
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:02,999
-  Thank you and we will come back

458
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,941
for this matter shortly,

459
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:07,557
and thank you for your
patience in that regard.

460
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:10,097
So that completes the call
of our Civil Calender,

461
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,403
is there anybody?

462
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:12,803
- So we're just trying to explain to her

463
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,618
what may happen today.

464
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:17,244
- Mm-hmm, what do you want to have happen?

465
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:19,946
- I just want him to stay
away from me that's all.

466
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,460
He gets out today, so I just want him

467
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,454
to stay away from me.

468
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,901
- Did he get picked up on Friday?

469
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,500
- No, he got picked up a week before last,

470
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,833
- It was Thursday,
- March 1st, and,

471
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,451
- Does he have a long history?

472
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:31,183
- Oh yeah, he's a felon, a big felon.

473
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:34,409
And this is third offense
assault on a female.

474
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,551
- With you, or with other women?

475
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:36,696
- Other women.

476
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:39,882
-  And just with her
case, there are three or four

477
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:42,117
felony charges.
- Three felonies.

478
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,015
- Do you have family close by?

479
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:45,920
- Yeah.
- So you feel,

480
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,223
when you're at home, you
feel like you're pretty safe?

481
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:49,745
- No (laughs).
- No.

482
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,149
- He's got it all.
- He's got friends.

483
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,790
- My worry is he's gonna get
- Her worry is more who he

484
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,545
knows or is going to ask.
- Some other people,

485
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:58,164
'cause his cousin lives
less than a mile from me.

486
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,966
- Does the judge know all this?

487
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,036
- No, not at all.
- No, she hasn't had a chance

488
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:02,433
to talk to him yet.

489
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,236
- Make sure that he knows all this stuff,

490
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:07,543
because the restraining
order's supposed to say

491
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:09,437
no third party contact, too.

492
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,770
- Yeah.
- So the, this sounds

493
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,943
fairly serious, don't be
afraid to say anything.

494
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:23,637
It's not your job to fix broken men.

495
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:28,183
- No, tell me about it.
(both laughing)

496
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:30,999
- A lot of us think that
it is, but it's not.

497
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,332
- Yeah, well (mumbling)

498
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:37,867
- I'm sorry.
- Well, thank you.

499
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,554
- Well, it was nice to meet you.

500
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:44,304
- Thank you, you too.

501
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:49,077
- All rise.
- Alright, we're here today

502
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:52,825
to address the matter of
a civil restraining order,

503
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:55,874
that would bar you from
having any contact.

504
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:58,502
What would you like to do,
would you like a moment

505
00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:00,310
to talk to Ms. Kennabrou?

506
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,669
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,051
-  Alright, thank you, yes, ma'am.

508
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:07,164
- It was a concern of Ms.
Morgan's that third party,

509
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:09,993
no third party contact be
allowed, and that'd be entered,

510
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:10,881
-  That would be the condition

511
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:12,298
of a DVPM.
- Okay

512
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:24,909
-  He turned
around and looked at me,

513
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,576
with that, his look.

514
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:32,048
(slow music)

515
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:03,454
- Yes, ma'am, what's up?

516
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,065
- So, I wanna talk with you
a little bit about this case

517
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:12,476
in Ashe County, involving
a woman who was kidnapped.

518
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:13,837
Pretty severe beating.

519
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,233
- And when you say kidnapped, do you mean?

520
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,938
- Kidnapped.
- Okay, held against her will,

521
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,248
- Held against her will,

522
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:20,148
She and her daughter,
- Transported.

523
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:24,315
- She and her daughter were
taken out of the state,

524
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:28,559
and driven all the way to
California, and halfway back.

525
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,241
And the truck was stopped in Oklahoma.

526
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,245
This was in an 18-wheeler.
- Okay.

527
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:34,751
- And he beat her for 4 1/2 days.

528
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:37,918
- What kind of injuries does she have?

529
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,388
Holy crap.
- So, this is the injuries.

530
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,240
- What'd he use?
- His fists,

531
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,990
a Maglite flashlight, he bit her.

532
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:56,159
- Any internal injuries?

533
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,690
Or is it all, is it all tissue injury?

534
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,996
Soft tissue injury?

535
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,089
- Well, he also strangled her.

536
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:04,274
- Okay, do we have any
medical doctor who's gonna say

537
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:06,524
these are serious injuries?

538
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:11,804
'Cause in state court,
that's the tough part.

539
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:15,083
Is when we're talking
about soft tissue injuries,

540
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:18,622
when you don't have damage to
the spleen, internal injuries,

541
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:21,122
or cuts that require stitches.

542
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,855
Concussions can be serious injury.

543
00:29:25,855 --> 00:29:29,245
- The local prosecutor called
this a misdemeanor assault.

544
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:31,438
- Okay, no.
- Yes.

545
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,529
- Okay, no, I would push felony charges,

546
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:38,723
probably for kidnapping,
if it's a Maglite,

547
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:42,511
a Maglite's a deadly weapon,
assault with a deadly weapon,

548
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:44,351
inflicting serious injury.

549
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,442
It's all about getting a medical
doctor to say on the stand,

550
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:49,888
"Yes, this is serious injury."

551
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,748
Is it serious bodily injury?

552
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,603
Sure, is it protracted pain and suffering

553
00:29:55,603 --> 00:29:59,429
that she has suffered, yeah, I think so.

554
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:02,634
But even if we succeed on all levels,

555
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,524
what I'm telling you, Kit, is
that you may not be satisfied

556
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:08,948
with the amount of time
that they're gonna get

557
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:10,109
at the state level.

558
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,232
- If he was convicted only
of misdemeanor assault

559
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:14,748
on a female, even with doing this.

560
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:16,008
- Yep.
- What would he

561
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:17,340
be looking at as far as time?

562
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,637
- The most he could receive
is 150 days in jail.

563
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:22,430
- 150 days in jail for this.
- That's it.

564
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,568
So that's what I'm saying,
you have a clearer case

565
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:28,261
where he's transporting a
woman across state lines,

566
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:31,462
for the purpose of terrorizing
and assaulting her.

567
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,640
That is a federal case, all over.

568
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,624
And so what we need to do,
or what you need to do,

569
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:40,989
since it's not in my
county, is really push

570
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:44,772
and talk to the federal
prosecutor in that area.

571
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:47,303
In that district, which would
be the Western District.

572
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,514
And say, this is the case,
and get them interested in it.

573
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,369
I think they will be.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

574
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,351
- I think they will be.
- Yeah.

575
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:56,768
(slow music)

576
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:16,155
- That's basically where
everything started that night.

577
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:19,322
Robbie just pulled up to the hospital,

578
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:26,025
in one of the lower parking lots.

579
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:29,891
He said if I screamed, the
security guards couldn't hear me.

580
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:33,058
And that's where he started his abuse.

581
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:47,221
I separated from him
because he was hitting me.

582
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:53,214
And then, he convinced
me, along with others,

583
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,502
that he had changed.

584
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:01,445
And I wanted to believe it.

585
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:05,855
And for my sake, and for Martina's sake,

586
00:32:05,855 --> 00:32:09,938
I wanted Martina to have
a daddy, she missed him.

587
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:14,799
Let him back into our lives, and it was

588
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,466
the biggest mistake I ever made.

589
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:21,903
My parents are scared for me, really.

590
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:26,419
I feel they're scared for
me to be with anybody.

591
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,419
They don't, they're just
too overprotective now.

592
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:36,456
They were then, but now it's worse.

593
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:40,373
They're afraid Robbie's
family's gonna hurt me.

594
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:43,529
But I don't, I don't like

595
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,051
feeling like I'm pitied.

596
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:53,522
(slow music)

597
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:14,126
- Since you are the
nation's foremost expert

598
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:17,838
on strangulation assaults,
this looks to me like she

599
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:19,724
was pretty seriously assaulted.

600
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:23,891
- (coughing) Okay, so give
me a 30 second overview,

601
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:29,250
beginning with the fact, that
she is still living, correct?

602
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,854
- She's still alive, she and her daughter

603
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:34,206
were kidnapped by her husband.

604
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:38,181
He beat her from North
Carolina to California.

605
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,824
The truck was stopped in Oklahoma.

606
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:45,024
Now he was not arrested,
by the Oklahoma police.

607
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,926
They just told him that he
had to find his own way back

608
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:49,373
to North Carolina and that was it.

609
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:51,941
I mean, when you look
at Deanna's photographs,

610
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:55,524
as a strangulation
expert, what do you see?

611
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,412
- Alright (sighing).

612
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:07,632
Well, it's bad.

613
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:13,645
It's bad, one has to
immediately go to the petechiae

614
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:17,714
around her left eye and,
to a certain extent,

615
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:19,529
around her right eye.

616
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,779
The white part of her eye,
the sclera, looks bloody

617
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:24,959
towards the middle part, and
that even looks more like

618
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,429
a subconjunctival hemorrhage.

619
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,670
So that's the tiny little
capillaries in the white part

620
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,837
of your eye actually bursting
from the choke hold itself.

621
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,968
Any emergency physical would
be thinking, "Could she

622
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:42,812
have been strangled?"
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:46,729
- And that's in addition
to the other elements.

624
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,272
- Now, one of the things
that she has said to me

625
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:55,439
is that she had a seizure
disorder that was in check.

626
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:59,040
Until she was assaulted like this.

627
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,018
- If you're cutting off all
the blood supply to the brain,

628
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,995
which is one of the reasons you pass out

629
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,977
when you're strangled, if
you have a seizure disorder,

630
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:12,144
it's going to start evidencing
it's pathology again.

631
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:20,491
There should be a lot less
here, that would have even been

632
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:25,059
prosecuted with a third of this pathology,

633
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:28,566
a tenth of this pathology.

634
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:39,639
I can't process that, I can't.

635
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,056
(slow music)

636
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,520
(people chattering)

637
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,480
- Do you want a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich?

638
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,313
- Hmm?
- Do you want a

639
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:18,312
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

640
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:21,145
- I'm gonna make some tuna.
- Okay.

641
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,636
- (laughs) Good girl.

642
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:27,994
- And then the bitch calls,
- Yep.

643
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:32,283
- The social worker called,
and wants to cover for Mike.

644
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:35,644
It was a miscommunication,
a fuckin' miscommunication,

645
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:37,741
my ass, is what went through by brain.

646
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:39,177
But, yes, Ma'am, I understand,
(people laughing)

647
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:42,582
thank you very much, I'll
see you in court on Thursday.

648
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:45,287
I've already called my
attorney, thank you.

649
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,050
- As the special order want.

650
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,983
- Let me ask you something.
- Okay.

651
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:50,908
- I felt fuckin' wonderful.

652
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,920
- What brought you home,
what brought you back here?

653
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,675
- That, one, you let me
come back home after I had

654
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:01,052
that nervous breakdown
that I had last weekend.

655
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,951
You let me come back home,
and you believed in me,

656
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,284
and you believed in me.

657
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:07,492
And these girls believed in me.

658
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:11,329
- That's right, and we believe in you.

659
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,305
- I'm able to stay sane.

660
00:37:13,305 --> 00:37:14,804
- It's 'cause you're worth it,

661
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:17,834
don't ever let anybody tell you otherwise.

662
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,584
- I refuse to.
- Good.

663
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,916
- That's right.
- Fuck 'em.

664
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,507
- You know I'll say it.
- Be happy she is.

665
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,340
- That's why I'm here.

666
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:32,054
(rain spattering)
(wipers rocking)

667
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,094
- Here we go, North Carolina thunderstorm.

668
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:42,636
This case that I'm working
on right now involves a woman

669
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:46,469
who killed her abuser,
after a number of years

670
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,223
of real severe domestic violence.

671
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:54,324
What I'm gonna do today is go
down and meet with her sister.

672
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:57,752
And her sister, Regina, has
photographs of what Latina

673
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:01,919
looked like before she got
together with her boyfriend.

674
00:38:03,493 --> 00:38:07,114
During the time that she was
with him, he puncher her in

675
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:10,793
the eye so many times that she's
now blind in her right eye.

676
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:13,923
And then I just wanna get a
sense of what we can all do

677
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:16,006
to try to support Latina.

678
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,936
She's charged with first-degree
murder, so she's looking

679
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:22,001
at spending the rest
of her life in prison.

680
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:25,001
(door clunking)
Hi.

681
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,962
When were these pictures taken?

682
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:39,222
- Those pictures are like
eight or nine years ago.

683
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:40,941
- From eight or nine years ago.

684
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:43,049
Do you mind if I snap
pictures of this picture

685
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,882
with my phone?
- Mm-mm.

686
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,608
You've been to see her in jail, right?

687
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:52,117
- Mm-hmm.
- So you see

688
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:54,720
how beautiful she was here.
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,396
And then now, her eye looks like it does.

690
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,498
So she's told me several
times that she really

691
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:01,537
loved him a lot.
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:05,408
Because every time he beat up
on her, she still went back.

693
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,491
And we just asked her why

694
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:13,327
you wanna go through things like that.

695
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:14,892
- What'd she say?
- She said she love him.

696
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:19,017
- Uh-huh, your mom mentioned
to me that she'd gone through

697
00:39:19,017 --> 00:39:20,693
a lot of stuff with your dad.

698
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:24,420
- Mm-hmm, my sister, she
told me that is why she is

699
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,972
the way she is right now,
because my dad used to beat up

700
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:30,952
on my mom all the time.

701
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,853
That's why she feel like she
don't want to leave Woody,

702
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:37,604
because she knows it's not
normal, but, in her mind,

703
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,364
it's normal to her, you
know what I'm saying?

704
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:41,678
- Mm-hmm.
- I kept telling my sister,

705
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:45,009
If you don't leave, he
gonna end up killing you.

706
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,243
And it was just shocking to know

707
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:49,826
that it happened the other way.

708
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,958
Because we cried plenty
of times on the phone,

709
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:59,125
talking about this, that he's
gonna kill her and all that.

710
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:06,531
I was hurt, because when
things like that happen,

711
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,561
you gotta survive.

712
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:17,426
- That's why he kept
that business so much.

713
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:20,986
Yeah, she was always scared
because he would always throw

714
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,275
that fist out, he done shot at her.

715
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:26,773
He done shot at her and my
cousin at the same time.

716
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:30,147
'Cause my cousin was sticking
up for her when he was about

717
00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:32,313
to beat her up, and she
said, "No, you're not fittin'

718
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,607
"to beat her up in front of me."

719
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:35,773
So then he started shooting at them.

720
00:40:35,773 --> 00:40:38,789
- Your cousin?
- My cousin, and they're

721
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:41,780
running down the path.
- See, this is the stuff.

722
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,102
- They're running down the pathway.

723
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:47,269
- This little stuff like this,
what's your cousin's name?

724
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:52,347
And see, if he'd have ever been arrested,

725
00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:55,489
and gone to jail for what he was doing,

726
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:58,818
then maybe that would given her a break.

727
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:02,985
- I was thinking that, yeah,
one of the time, the last time,

728
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:07,112
when he beat her up
like really, really bad,

729
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:10,363
that he messed up her eye,
her ribs and all that.

730
00:41:10,363 --> 00:41:13,023
I think he had a warrant
for his arrest for that.

731
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:16,926
- Right, right, but then he
was killed before they ever got

732
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:19,038
a chance to do anything with that.

733
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:20,819
- Yeah.
- Right.

734
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:24,986
If you can think of anybody
else that has, like this woman

735
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,761
that was with Latina when he
shot at them, please send me

736
00:41:28,761 --> 00:41:30,483
that information, so that,
- Okay.

737
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:33,051
- we just, I wanna make
sure that when it's time

738
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:35,890
to go to court, that
everybody's real clear about how

739
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,161
dangerous he was, okay?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

740
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,994
(rain spattering)

741
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:51,741
- So the Harnett County
judicial buildings are coming

742
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:53,560
up on the right-hand side.

743
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,654
The detention center's
back behind the courthouse,

744
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:57,904
and that's where Latina is.

745
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:04,180
Where she's been since last,
the end of last November.

746
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:08,870
And I've worked other cases
with women who have killed

747
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,010
their abusers and they've
told me that they feel safer

748
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:16,598
in prison than they ever felt
out in the world, with him.

749
00:42:16,598 --> 00:42:20,765
Because he was so predatory and
the courts just didn't care.

750
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,257
I mean, I can think of all kinds of women

751
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:26,532
that I've talked to.

752
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:29,516
And they have told me that once
she killed him, and she went

753
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:33,683
to prison, that was the first
time in years she felt safe.

754
00:42:34,603 --> 00:42:38,770
(rain spattering)
(wind rustling)

755
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,764
- In general, when we're
thinking about accepting a case,

756
00:42:49,764 --> 00:42:52,914
one of the things we think
about, one of the things I think

757
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:56,509
about, is, how am I gonna prove this case?

758
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,099
And if it has to go to trial,

759
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,436
how am I gonna prove the case at trial?

760
00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:04,751
What is my evidence gonna be
at trial and how will the jury

761
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,168
be affected by that evidence.

762
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,896
I mean, the pictures are just,

763
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:13,063
they say it better than any words can.

764
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:18,791
The fact that it seemed to
be a very good, viable case

765
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,653
A Violence Against Women Act case.

766
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:22,557
The interstate domestic
violence, we had the crossing

767
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:26,724
of the state lines, it seemed
like if we didn't do it,

768
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:29,214
nobody else was going to.

769
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:30,748
Because there were a lot of times

770
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:32,754
she didn't know where she was.

771
00:43:32,754 --> 00:43:36,747
So she didn't know whether a
particular assault happened

772
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:40,302
in Oklahoma or New Mexico,
but we knew that she had

773
00:43:40,302 --> 00:43:42,821
been forcibly taken from here.

774
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:46,461
So we could prosecute it here,
and if we didn't prosecute

775
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:49,525
it here, it may not have been
prosecuted any place else.

776
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:52,929
Because we didn't know where
the assaults were taking place.

777
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:55,622
So that also made it
compelling, if we weren't gonna

778
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:58,876
do anything, then maybe
nothing was gonna be done.

779
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:00,341
And something had to be done.

780
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:03,341
(slow guitar music)

781
00:44:19,304 --> 00:44:20,468
- Hey there, we're just about there,

782
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:22,836
we're like five minutes away.

783
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:26,836
Alright, I'll see you in
a few minutes, bye-bye.

784
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:33,504
We're gonna go talk with
Deanna about how she's feeling

785
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,805
about court and about what's
it going to mean to her,

786
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:39,480
to be able to take the witness stand.

787
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,647
And say out loud what Robbie
did to her, and to Martina.

788
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:50,469
Are you nervous about testifying

789
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:52,038
or do you feel okay about it?

790
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:55,031
So what are you doing to prepare yourself?

791
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:58,654
- Just keep telling myself
that I know I can do it.

792
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,249
And I've got a lot of
people backing me up.

793
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:05,832
This is Deanna's thick
file, her case file.

794
00:45:09,823 --> 00:45:13,858
District Attorney said that
a juror or defense attorney

795
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:18,025
may ask why she didn't call
someone and ask for help.

796
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:21,508
And Robbie had told her
not to pick up a phone

797
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:23,611
at the truck stop.

798
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:26,823
Stated that, many would
argue that she had the chance

799
00:45:26,823 --> 00:45:29,357
to get away in Virginia,
when they stopped at

800
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:32,422
a truck stop for several hours.

801
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:36,900
- What do you think you'll
say when his defense attorneys

802
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,872
try to say things to you
like, "Why didn't you try

803
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:40,890
to get away?" Or, "Why
didn't you call the police?"

804
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,807
Or something like that?

805
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:47,574
- I was too scared.

806
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:51,641
There was lots of things,
ways, running through my mind.

807
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:55,123
Of how I could get away,
but I couldn't do it.

808
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:57,140
I was afraid I would wake him up,

809
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,259
if Martina had made a noise.

810
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,556
He would have instantly woke up.

811
00:46:02,556 --> 00:46:06,639
And she had coloring books
and crayons, I thought

812
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:12,648
about tearing the back out
of one of the coloring books

813
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:17,527
and writing help me, and
sticking it behind the curtain.

814
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:21,013
Maybe people passing by on
the interstate would see it.

815
00:46:21,013 --> 00:46:25,180
And call the law, and then,
again, I was afraid he would

816
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,075
see it and if he did see
it, he would probably have

817
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:33,185
instantly killed me.

818
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:37,261
And I never knew what
would happen to Martina.

819
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,907
-  There were so many injustices

820
00:46:38,907 --> 00:46:42,000
that I felt like happened with her.

821
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,667
Martina was removed in
Oklahoma from Deanna.

822
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,604
And that just, that really angered me.

823
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,175
- What was it like when
they came and took Martina?

824
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:56,062
- It destroyed me.

825
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:57,645
It took everything.

826
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:02,521
It was the hardest
moment in my whole life.

827
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:05,327
-  I bet, and how
often did you see Martina,

828
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:07,501
in the time that she
was taken away from you?

829
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:09,834
- Twice a week, for an hour.

830
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:13,622
(slow music)

831
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,867
- Come here, come here.

832
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:26,034
(squealing) Piggyback,
piggyback (squeals).

833
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,556
- Where are we going how?

834
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:45,723
I could talk to her on
the phone every night.

835
00:47:45,723 --> 00:47:47,659
-  What kinds of
things did she say to you?

836
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,744
- Wanted to know why I gave her away.

837
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:55,109
And that, that was hard,
that was really hard.

838
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:57,685
I would tell her that she was staying

839
00:47:57,685 --> 00:48:01,721
with the foster parents
so they could protect her.

840
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:04,388
(both laughing)

841
00:48:10,217 --> 00:48:12,528
- I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

842
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:15,890
- She still asks me,
now, she still asks me

843
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,425
why I gave her away.

844
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:19,842
- So she remembers it.
- Yeah.

845
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:27,004
Wait up, wait up (laughs) wait up.

846
00:48:37,138 --> 00:48:39,888
(birds chirping)

847
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:45,517
-  You don't
understand, I'm not over it.

848
00:48:45,517 --> 00:48:47,148
I'm not over y'all coming 'round there,

849
00:48:47,148 --> 00:48:49,486
and they thought they're
gonna testify against me.

850
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:51,535
I'm not over that shit.

851
00:48:51,535 --> 00:48:56,505
I can't understand why my
daughters would go against me.

852
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:58,848
Don't ever go against me!

853
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:01,759
You understand what I'm saying?

854
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:03,381
(crashing)

855
00:49:03,381 --> 00:49:04,974
Fucking go against me!

856
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,473
Never go!
(thudding)

857
00:49:06,473 --> 00:49:09,409
Never fucking!
(thudding)

858
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:11,570
Never! Never, Never!
(smacking)

859
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,832
Fucking go against me!

860
00:49:12,832 --> 00:49:14,489
Don't ever go

861
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,577
(smacking loudly)
fucking against me!

862
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:17,783
- Okay.
- You understand

863
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:20,045
what I'm saying?
- Yes.

864
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:21,240
-  I
kept having to get you

865
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,971
or my daughters, God damn it,
I'd never do that to my dad.

866
00:49:25,971 --> 00:49:28,290
What's wrong with y'all?

867
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,622
Now am I a person that you fuck with?

868
00:49:30,622 --> 00:49:32,510
I mean, seriously,
- No.

869
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,116
-  I
mean, look, look at me.

870
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:35,941
Just look at my face.

871
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:37,525
(smacking)
Is that a motherfucker

872
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:38,358
that you fuck?

873
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:39,560
(smacking)

874
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,328
Is that a fucker that you fuck with?

875
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:42,360
-  No.

876
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,576
- Is it?
- No.

877
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:45,772
- Who's gonna take care of you?

878
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:47,248
-  You are.

879
00:49:47,248 --> 00:49:48,093
-  Who's
gonna fucking provide?

880
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:48,926
-  You are.

881
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:50,583
Who's the son of a bitch

882
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,491
that's stands in front
of the fucking monster

883
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,868
and keeps them from raping y'all?

884
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,534
-  You did.

885
00:49:58,534 --> 00:50:01,716
- I get calls from battered
women all over the country.

886
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:04,788
And emails, and this one
happens to be from a woman

887
00:50:04,788 --> 00:50:07,979
who's married to a doctor,
a very prominent physician.

888
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:09,896
And they made this tape

889
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,308
not long after there was a
restraining order hearing,

890
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:20,714
but the female judge, who
knew that he was a doctor,

891
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:22,465
said, "Just let him come home,

892
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:24,422
"your house is big
enough for both of you."

893
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:28,589
And so it's just so frustrating
because we don't know

894
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:34,830
what's going on in
these gated communities,

895
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,997
in these expensive homes, until
something like this happens.

896
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:43,158
So I tore this up.

897
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:50,783
I tore this up, because
I was so angry about it.

898
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:54,395
It's a rough draft of a paper
that I turned it recently.

899
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:58,992
And the professor wrote
a note across the bottom.

900
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:01,216
So it made me mad and I tore it up.

901
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:04,104
(tape tearing)

902
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:07,455
Now I'm gonna put it back together again.

903
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,431
Kit, a very interesting discussion.

904
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:12,619
I have two recommendations,
first, you say in the beginning

905
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:14,063
that domestic violence, quote,

906
00:51:14,063 --> 00:51:16,111
"touches all socio-economic groups."

907
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:18,322
I am not an expert in this field,

908
00:51:18,322 --> 00:51:20,965
but my impression is that
domestic violence is more

909
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:24,190
common among poor, less educated people.

910
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,347
Most middle-class
persons, such as doctors,

911
00:51:26,347 --> 00:51:28,183
lawyers and professors, et cetera,

912
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:31,266
do not beat their wives and children.

913
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:35,596
Nice, nice, but I'm going to save this.

914
00:51:39,817 --> 00:51:43,403
Because this is a reminder
to me, that we have a long,

915
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,153
long, long way to go.

916
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:53,210
(both laughing)
(bike tires grinding)

917
00:51:54,538 --> 00:51:56,205
- Whee! Whoa!
- Good.

918
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,707
This was my favorite photo of Martina.

919
00:52:12,435 --> 00:52:16,602
It did have Robbie in it,
and of course, I cut it out.

920
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,127
It's just her, now, so.

921
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:30,075
Read it,
- First soccer practice.

922
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,947
Halloween, okay, I can't read that.

923
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,243
- Beware of ghosts and goblins.

924
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:48,437
-  Beware of ghosts and goblins.

925
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:52,604
(slow music)
(people chattering)

926
00:52:58,263 --> 00:52:59,930
- Halloween of 2008.

927
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:06,230
Deanna and her husband were separated.

928
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,869
There had been a domestic
violence incident earlier

929
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:12,583
in the summer, they were living apart.

930
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:16,115
But, it was Halloween, and
Deanna decided that she was gonna

931
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:19,840
ask Robbie if he wanted
to go along with her

932
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,784
and their daughter,
trick-or-treating in downtown

933
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:24,367
West Jefferson, North Carolina.

934
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,232
They drove down, together,
to the downtown area.

935
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:30,183
But for some reason, Robbie didn't want

936
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:31,662
to get out of the car.

937
00:53:31,662 --> 00:53:34,538
So Deanna took their
daughter trick-or-treating.

938
00:53:34,538 --> 00:53:38,705
And when she came back to the
car, he was focused on the

939
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:42,465
fact that she may have been
talking to another male

940
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:46,441
while they were trick-or-treating,
and he became jealous.

941
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:48,486
And as the night progressed,

942
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:51,903
he was getting more angry and more angry.

943
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:57,969
He drove them down to a
secluded area of a parking lot

944
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,917
outside of the local hospital.

945
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:03,343
And so he was confronting
her, and hitting her,

946
00:54:03,343 --> 00:54:05,621
and he eventually got out his lighter

947
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:09,015
and was hitting her ears with the lighter.

948
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:12,736
Basically trying to force her to confess

949
00:54:12,736 --> 00:54:15,382
that she was involved with another man.

950
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:17,100
All the while, the daughter was asleep

951
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,183
in the back of the truck.

952
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:23,290
(mellow guitar music)

953
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,233
Finally, in the morning,
the daughter woke up,

954
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:28,281
and Robbie announced
that they were all taking

955
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,531
a cross-country truck trip.

956
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,150
He had a cousin who
co-drove the truck with him,

957
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,373
so the arrangement was that
he would meet his cousin,

958
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:41,849
John, to deliver this load to California.

959
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:45,453
They were being secret about
this because the truck company

960
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:49,073
had a policy against unauthorized riders.

961
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:51,969
And Deanna and the daughter
would be unauthorized riders.

962
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:55,542
(engine sputtering)
They eventually all get in

963
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,401
to this tractor trailer.

964
00:54:57,401 --> 00:54:59,839
They drove across the
line from North Carolina

965
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,920
to Virginia, stopped at a truck stop.

966
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,708
Where, for a couple of
hours, Robbie and John played

967
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:08,598
the video poker machines,
while Deanna and the daughter

968
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:11,015
walked around the truck stop.

969
00:55:12,415 --> 00:55:15,892
Deanna had no money, no cell
phone, didn't know anybody

970
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:19,393
up there, so she didn't alert anyone

971
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:21,436
that she was there against her will.

972
00:55:21,436 --> 00:55:25,629
She got back into the truck,
they drove down into Tennessee.

973
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:29,225
And, again, Robbie becomes
obsessed with this idea

974
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:33,392
that she's cheating on him, so
he has John drive the truck.

975
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:37,767
He gets back in the cab, he
just started beating on her

976
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:42,438
and it was like the night
before, where he wanted to beat

977
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,299
her into confessing to cheating on him.

978
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,243
And, initially, she was
saying, "No, I'm not.

979
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:47,473
"I'm not cheating on you."

980
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:48,973
And he would beat her some more.

981
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:51,606
Well, finally, she decided
that that wasn't working,

982
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:54,455
so she was gonna admit to cheating on him,

983
00:55:54,455 --> 00:55:56,921
hoping that that would get
him to stop beating her.

984
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,621
So she started saying, "Yes,
yes, I did cheat on you."

985
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:03,015
And then he started saying,
"Well, who, with who?

986
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:04,406
Gimme some names."

987
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:07,155
And so she just started
spouting off names of people

988
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:11,894
that they knew, so he
forced her to use his phone.

989
00:56:11,894 --> 00:56:15,024
To call these people, that she was naming,

990
00:56:15,024 --> 00:56:16,645
back home in North Carolina.

991
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:18,595
And so, people back in
North Carolina were getting

992
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:21,638
phone calls, in the middle of
the night, where she admitted

993
00:56:21,638 --> 00:56:24,474
that she had cheated on Robbie.

994
00:56:24,474 --> 00:56:28,246
She called a husband
and wife named the Guys,

995
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:31,525
told the wife, Hope, that
she had cheated with Mike.

996
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:35,976
But eventually Hope could tell
that something wasn't right.

997
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:40,378
Deanna's tone on the phone
calls, she sounded robotic.

998
00:56:40,378 --> 00:56:44,696
Hope got the impression that
something was not right.

999
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,987
While the truck is traveling
west, and Robbie is continuing

1000
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,182
to beat Deanna, and accuse
her of cheating on him,

1001
00:56:51,182 --> 00:56:54,403
people back home are starting
to figure out that something

1002
00:56:54,403 --> 00:56:56,906
is wrong, and they call
the trucking company.

1003
00:56:56,906 --> 00:56:59,061
And eventually alert them that there

1004
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:01,418
are unauthorized people on the truck.

1005
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,733
Well, 'til that happens,
they get to California,

1006
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:07,983
drop off the load, they head back east.

1007
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,971
John's driving, they're
heading towards Oklahoma.

1008
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:16,138
And Robbie just, this is the
absolute worst beating of all.

1009
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:24,744
-  He headed me back
to the sleeper, of the truck,

1010
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:28,151
and that's when he started
hurting me the worst.

1011
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:32,318
And Martina was sitting there,
and he kept covering my face

1012
00:57:33,177 --> 00:57:36,446
with the pillow and he was
telling me that I wasn't gonna

1013
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:39,267
make it back to West Jefferson.

1014
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:43,252
And I couldn't breathe, and
when he realized that I wasn't

1015
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,718
moving, he pulled the
pillow off of my face.

1016
00:57:46,718 --> 00:57:48,451
And he started laughing and he said,

1017
00:57:48,451 --> 00:57:52,414
"I almost got you that time, didn't I?"

1018
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:56,015
And it was right after
that, that I started having

1019
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:59,309
I had seizures, and I had three seizures.

1020
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,240
And I could hear Martina screaming.

1021
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,575
I couldn't see anything, I
could just hear her screaming.

1022
00:58:06,575 --> 00:58:09,658
And when I did stop, he pulled me up,

1023
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:13,844
next to Martina, and I went to sleep.

1024
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:17,880
And that was the first
time, the entire trip,

1025
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,963
that I was able to sleep.

1026
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,586
- Finally, the folks back
at home had gotten in touch

1027
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,601
with the trucking company, and
they arranged for the truck

1028
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:31,434
to be stopped.
(siren blaring)

1029
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:37,148
It was pulled over by law
enforcement in Oklahoma,

1030
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:42,007
but as the blue lights were
turned on, Robbie told Deanna

1031
00:58:42,007 --> 00:58:44,018
that they were gonna
tell the police when they

1032
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:47,192
were stopped that he saved
her, from a boyfriend back in

1033
00:58:47,192 --> 00:58:50,025
North Carolina who had beaten her.

1034
00:58:51,463 --> 00:58:54,282
- I had received a call
that had a child in danger,

1035
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:57,392
and we needed to do a
traffic stop on a semi.

1036
00:58:57,392 --> 00:58:59,557
So that's what I did.

1037
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:01,137
And when I found what I found inside,

1038
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,054
was the little girl and the mother.

1039
00:59:09,715 --> 00:59:12,519
In the 15 years I've been
a law enforcement officer,

1040
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:14,429
I've never seen anybody
that's been in a car wreck

1041
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:17,310
that was beat up as bad as that girl was.

1042
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,536
Even if they was throwed out
of the vehicle, mangled up

1043
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:22,677
in the vehicle, they still,
I've never seen anybody

1044
00:59:22,677 --> 00:59:25,752
that was in that kind of shape.

1045
00:59:25,752 --> 00:59:27,923
I truly believe if I hadn't
had stopped the vehicle,

1046
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:31,673
I don't think they would
have ever come home.

1047
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:35,407
The reason he wasn't detained
is because I didn't have

1048
00:59:35,407 --> 00:59:37,949
no proof of where it
had actually happened.

1049
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,779
I had no paperwork
stating anything was out

1050
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:43,393
of the ordinary or anything.

1051
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,466
She wouldn't tell us who done it,

1052
00:59:45,466 --> 00:59:47,080
because of the fear factor.

1053
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,529
I think she feared more for the child

1054
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:50,547
than she did her own life.

1055
00:59:50,547 --> 00:59:52,714
That's why she didn't say.

1056
00:59:54,977 --> 00:59:57,210
- Once they were separated,
once she was in the car,

1057
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,514
and away from him, she
told them that, in fact,

1058
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:03,049
Robbie had been the
one who had beaten her.

1059
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:07,137
The police could tell that
she was very badly beaten,

1060
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:10,737
they took her to the hospital in Oklahoma.

1061
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:12,618
- Deanna Howell presented
at my Emergency Room

1062
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:16,831
in Anadarko Hospital,
in Anadarko Oklahoma.

1063
01:00:16,831 --> 01:00:21,391
When I first saw her, I was
horrified by her appearance.

1064
01:00:21,391 --> 01:00:24,291
Obviously, with every
movement that she made,

1065
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,841
she was experiencing pain.

1066
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:29,733
Initially, it was important
for us to clean her up,

1067
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:32,594
as she was covered in dried blood.

1068
01:00:32,594 --> 01:00:35,494
And when I felt her
hair, it was very sticky

1069
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:38,073
and very soiled, and I asked her,

1070
01:00:38,073 --> 01:00:40,605
at that point, what was in her hair.

1071
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:42,519
Which she shared with me at that time,

1072
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:45,019
it was Mountain Dew and urine.

1073
01:00:46,664 --> 01:00:48,331
And when I asked her

1074
01:00:51,028 --> 01:00:52,291
how that came to be,

1075
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:55,846
she stated that he would throw his soda,

1076
01:00:55,846 --> 01:00:59,110
her ex-husband would throw
his soda in her face.

1077
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:02,110
And that whenever he had to urinate,

1078
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:08,197
he would hold her by the
ears and urinate in her face.

1079
01:01:10,464 --> 01:01:12,234
I took photos of Deanna
in the Emergency Room,

1080
01:01:12,234 --> 01:01:16,254
she obviously was still
in fear of her ex-husband.

1081
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:19,885
And when I went out and asked
the officer, could he please

1082
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,669
tell me where her was
ex-husband was located,

1083
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:25,361
with the intent of finding out where he

1084
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:28,368
was incarcerated, and being held at.

1085
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:31,172
When he piped off to me that,
"He's somewhere between here

1086
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:33,966
and North Carolina, I guess."

1087
01:01:33,966 --> 01:01:36,489
- Robbie was left at the
side of the road in Oklahoma

1088
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:40,760
because she hadn't told
police before he left

1089
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,546
that he was the one who beat her,

1090
01:01:42,546 --> 01:01:44,894
and he made his way
back to North Carolina.

1091
01:01:44,894 --> 01:01:46,778
Once he got back to North
Carolina, he was interviewed

1092
01:01:46,778 --> 01:01:51,448
by law enforcement, and
admitted to beating her so badly

1093
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:54,531
that he almost broke his fingers, so.

1094
01:01:57,763 --> 01:02:00,763
(telephone ringing)

1095
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:14,313
- Mm-hmm, I just wonder if
somehow his cousin got to her.

1096
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:24,822
Because, with his cousin not
charged, he's really free

1097
01:02:24,822 --> 01:02:29,061
to do whatever, to intimidate
you, or intimidate her.

1098
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,328
And I just wonder if that's part of,

1099
01:02:31,328 --> 01:02:32,971
if that's part of what's happening.

1100
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:36,804
I mean, it might not be,
but it also might be.

1101
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,067
So how's Martina?

1102
01:02:45,893 --> 01:02:47,507
-  She's doing good (mumbling)

1103
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:49,265
- Yeah, and that's gonna make it hard.

1104
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:53,279
But, maybe what you can do
is you can take those strong

1105
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:57,070
feelings that you've got,
and just really use those

1106
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,016
to be crystal clear in court.

1107
01:02:59,016 --> 01:03:00,849
To just say the things

1108
01:03:04,571 --> 01:03:06,236
that you need to say, so the court

1109
01:03:06,236 --> 01:03:08,819
understands what he did to you.

1110
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,073
Alright, well, Deanna,
have a really good day,

1111
01:03:12,073 --> 01:03:14,843
and I'm glad you called,
and I'll talk to you

1112
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:16,354
in the next couple days, okay?

1113
01:03:16,354 --> 01:03:19,094
- Alright.
- Alright, bye, Deanna.

1114
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:20,344
-  Bye.

1115
01:03:21,378 --> 01:03:22,795
- Fucking Robbie.

1116
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:29,794
(wind chimes tinkling)
(birds chirping)

1117
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:34,657
Even with all the, there's
a lot of dark things

1118
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:38,407
that happen up here,
like Deanna's case, but.

1119
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,537
I do love these mountains.

1120
01:03:51,845 --> 01:03:55,012
That's Jack and Jason, that's October.

1121
01:03:55,869 --> 01:03:58,800
And he died the next August,
cleaning up an oil spill

1122
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,773
in the Gulf of Mexico.

1123
01:04:00,773 --> 01:04:04,940
I look at that picture of
his hair shining in the sun.

1124
01:04:06,136 --> 01:04:08,399
And that was one of my jobs,
was to take care of his hair,

1125
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:11,523
to make sure he didn't have split ends.

1126
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:15,141
So that when he went out
(clearing throat) to go pick

1127
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:17,912
up women, that one of the
things that would draw women

1128
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:21,196
to him was his long, blonde hair.

1129
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:23,279
He had a beautiful smile.

1130
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,639
-  You stayed with this guy.

1131
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,773
- Yeah, I didn't have choice.

1132
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:32,611
I mean, he told me, and I absolutely,

1133
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:36,841
that's the part that always,
it's so interesting to me.

1134
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:40,187
When it's like, the standard
question, why didn't you leave?

1135
01:04:40,187 --> 01:04:41,428
Why didn't you leave,
why didn't you leave?

1136
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:43,911
Well, he was trained by the
United States Marine Corps

1137
01:04:43,911 --> 01:04:45,717
to hunt people down and kill
them, and he told me if I left,

1138
01:04:45,717 --> 01:04:47,007
he would hunt me down and kill me.

1139
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,638
That's why I didn't leave.

1140
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:51,514
I used to pull what he would
call my disappearing acts.

1141
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:55,596
And that would be, I would
get the boys and get out.

1142
01:04:55,596 --> 01:04:59,450
Because it just was getting too intense.

1143
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,091
But I would always go back,

1144
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:03,651
because at least I knew where he was.

1145
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:08,520
At least I knew the routine,
I knew what to expect.

1146
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,762
But it's a terrible way to live to always

1147
01:05:12,762 --> 01:05:15,262
be looking over your shoulder.

1148
01:05:17,088 --> 01:05:20,568
He also had good sides,
too, I mean, I remember,

1149
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:25,228
being in the funeral
home looking at his body.

1150
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:30,174
And starting at the top of
his head, and going down,

1151
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:32,426
and thinking, looking at
his hands and thinking

1152
01:05:32,426 --> 01:05:36,256
that his hands were both
a weapon, and it was also

1153
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:40,346
with his hands that he
taught me how to garden.

1154
01:05:40,346 --> 01:05:43,346
So it's not clean, it's complicated.

1155
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:49,217
There's just a lot more
to it than people willing

1156
01:05:49,217 --> 01:05:51,300
to give women credit for.

1157
01:05:53,554 --> 01:05:55,877
This picture, that picture
right there, that picture

1158
01:05:55,877 --> 01:05:58,467
was taken the last day that he was nice.

1159
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:00,390
On that one day, it was
a beautiful fall day,

1160
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,695
and he said, "Let's go
ride up on the parkway."

1161
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:05,169
And it was just so out of the ordinary.

1162
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:09,604
But I was thrilled, that we
were gonna have a good day.

1163
01:06:09,604 --> 01:06:11,207
And it was a great day.

1164
01:06:11,207 --> 01:06:15,374
(slow music)
(birds chirping)

1165
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:34,959
- It was just confirmed
that we were still on

1166
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:38,805
and I'm told to be there at 8:30.

1167
01:06:39,944 --> 01:06:42,444
I am nervous about testifying.

1168
01:06:44,603 --> 01:06:48,770
I don't know, really, what,
I don't know what's going on.

1169
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:53,301
I guess I'll find out this morning.

1170
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:57,384
Everybody's telling me to
be strong, be truthful.

1171
01:07:00,757 --> 01:07:04,113
And that they're praying for me.

1172
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:08,280
Yesterday, when I got up,
there was just something inside

1173
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:14,148
of me, just this feeling
that I had, that I needed to,

1174
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:20,111
after the trial is over, give
Robbie a picture of Martina.

1175
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:26,013
I just want him to know,
pretty much, what he's missed.

1176
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:31,082
And that he's missed a
lot in the last two years.

1177
01:07:32,242 --> 01:07:36,159
I mean, his daughter is
really growed up a lot.

1178
01:07:37,264 --> 01:07:41,232
And if he hadn't had done what he did,

1179
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:43,562
he would have been there for it.

1180
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:46,062
(tense music)

1181
01:07:55,074 --> 01:07:58,157
(footsteps clanking)

1182
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,847
(light piano music)

1183
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:20,153
I'm not gonna let him get
away with what he done to me,

1184
01:08:20,153 --> 01:08:24,513
my daughter, to other
women out there, who have,

1185
01:08:24,513 --> 01:08:26,596
I'm sure he's done it to.

1186
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:32,476
Nobody should get away with this, nobody.

1187
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,981
(door slamming)

1188
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:51,981
(slow guitar music)

1189
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,900
- I'm reading from a portion
of the trial transcript.

1190
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,589
The defense lawyer stated in
his opening statement that what

1191
01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:12,812
really happened here was
they went on a family trip.

1192
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:14,722
And it was a trip that she was willing

1193
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:17,539
to go on, and happy to go on.

1194
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:21,185
The government, I, argued that
it wasn't a voluntary trip.

1195
01:09:21,185 --> 01:09:24,247
That she was kidnapped
and beaten along the way.

1196
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:26,914
And that the jury should find
him guilty of both counts,

1197
01:09:26,914 --> 01:09:31,081
the kidnapping and the
interstate domestic violence.

1198
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:36,114
The government called the nurse
who saw Deanna in Oklahoma,

1199
01:09:36,114 --> 01:09:39,314
several of the people who had
received strange phone calls

1200
01:09:39,314 --> 01:09:41,688
from Deanna during the trip.

1201
01:09:41,688 --> 01:09:44,105
Deanna, of course, testified.

1202
01:09:46,503 --> 01:09:47,548
-  When Deanna
took the witness stand,

1203
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:49,127
my heart was pounding.

1204
01:09:49,127 --> 01:09:52,397
Because I understood the
consequences of this trial.

1205
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,480
If he were to be found not
guilty, he'd be back out on

1206
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:59,927
the streets, and he'd be
a threat to her again.

1207
01:09:59,927 --> 01:10:03,669
But when I see what Deanna
has done, that she's faced

1208
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:06,373
her abuser, she's walked
into federal court,

1209
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,378
she's taken the witness stand.

1210
01:10:08,378 --> 01:10:12,211
I'm just completely
astonished at her courage.

1211
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:27,416
- The jury made their decision
of guilty on both counts,

1212
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,629
and I feel absolutely awesome (laughs).

1213
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:36,809
I could feel the tears coming,
they didn't actually start

1214
01:10:36,809 --> 01:10:40,726
falling, but I could feel them coming.

1215
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:43,571
They wanna come now (laughs).

1216
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:44,738
I am so happy.

1217
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:52,420
I will be glad to get home to Martina.

1218
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,021
- I'll be glad for you
to get home to Martina,

1219
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:55,424
I know she wants her mom home.

1220
01:10:55,424 --> 01:10:57,341
- Yes, she does.
- Yeah.

1221
01:10:58,657 --> 01:11:03,497
Robbie was sentenced to almost
21 years in federal prison.

1222
01:11:03,497 --> 01:11:06,720
But the sad and tragic
reality, is that the majority

1223
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,055
of the time he serves will
be for kidnapping Deanna,

1224
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,722
not for beating her.

1225
01:11:12,362 --> 01:11:14,952
I can't help thinking about
the fact that, after Robbie

1226
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:17,686
kidnapped Deanna, and almost killed her.

1227
01:11:17,686 --> 01:11:20,458
That when she came back, she
had to listen to the DAs,

1228
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,149
to the police, to the defense attorney,

1229
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:27,316
and even her own family ask
her why she didn't just leave.

1230
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:30,963
When, in reality, that's
precisely what she did do.

1231
01:11:30,963 --> 01:11:34,948
She left, and he retaliated
by kidnapping her,

1232
01:11:34,948 --> 01:11:37,652
and beating her for 4 1/2 days.

1233
01:11:37,652 --> 01:11:41,208
So she did what everyone wanted her to do.

1234
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:44,625
And she almost paid for it with her life.

1235
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,551
(slow guitar music)

1236
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:02,065
I've been training advocates
for a lot of years.

1237
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:04,398
Since the early, since 1990.

1238
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:08,291
And I'm always so astonished

1239
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:13,332
and moved at the people who
want to come into this movement,

1240
01:12:13,332 --> 01:12:16,601
and do this work, because
it's not easy work.

1241
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:19,905
It can be heartbreaking and frustrating,

1242
01:12:19,905 --> 01:12:23,307
but it can also be unbelievably uplifting.

1243
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:25,375
And you see things, and hear things

1244
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,510
that you couldn't make up.

1245
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:31,093
And you witness victims
shedding that skin,

1246
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:38,122
and just leaving the violence behind.

1247
01:12:41,407 --> 01:12:43,074
It's just wonderful.

1248
01:12:56,675 --> 01:13:00,842
- We are at a place that I'm
looking at hoping to rent.

1249
01:13:02,842 --> 01:13:05,175
A new step, a new beginning.

1250
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:09,077
Getting out of my parents house.

1251
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:11,577
And starting over, a new life.

1252
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:18,846
- The inside the house.

1253
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:22,397
That blind does not pull straight anyway.

1254
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:25,040
Well, the lady said to
tell you she's packing up,

1255
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,466
moving, so there's stuff sitting around.

1256
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:31,485
This is the bedroom,
stuff sitting in here.

1257
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:33,957
And the chest of drawers.

1258
01:13:33,957 --> 01:13:37,957
And self-cleaning oven,
you have a refrigerator,

1259
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:41,697
washer and dryer, commode.

1260
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:44,943
Big, good shower, tub.

1261
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:51,053
That's it, plus the beautiful view.

1262
01:13:51,053 --> 01:13:53,938
- Yes, I've already saw that, I love it.

1263
01:13:53,938 --> 01:13:56,119
- Parkway that way,
Grandfather Mountain, that way.

1264
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:57,646
You can see Grandfather Mountain today.

1265
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,972
Some days you can't see
it, when it gets real hazy,

1266
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:02,931
but you can see it good today.

1267
01:14:02,931 --> 01:14:04,681
-  I love it.

1268
01:14:09,095 --> 01:14:10,542
It's perfect.

1269
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:13,709
(mellow guitar music)

1270
01:14:43,556 --> 01:14:46,389
(uplifting music)

1271
01:17:10,536 --> 01:17:14,671
(tone reverberating)
(static huming)
