1
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:41,402
Nina!

2
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:57,721
Dax!

3
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:20,234
The hacienda of Jaime Xenos,
attorney at law.

4
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,373
A traitor.

5
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,880
You'll find all his family there.

6
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:30,082
Wife, Vera Xenos,
daughter, Teresa Xenos, age 16...

7
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,082
son, Dax Xenos, age 10.

8
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:35,724
They're all traitors.

9
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,929
- You understand?
- I understand, Col. Gutierrez.

10
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,342
Quickly, Dax. Come.

11
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,470
- They shot Nina.
- Come, close the gate.

12
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:56,540
Come on.

13
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,622
Soldiers. Quick, bolt the windows and doors.

14
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:16,130
Everybody in the cellar. Come on.

15
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,364
Go!

16
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:24,604
Hurry!

17
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,774
But, Mama...

18
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,483
- Here's Teresa.
- Close the door. Come on.

19
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:34,213
- Come on, Mama.
- Get down!

20
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:36,648
Now be quiet.

21
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,402
Where's Papa?

22
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:55,373
He'll come. Just be quiet, he'll come.

23
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,888
Don't be afraid, I am here.

24
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,853
Be quiet. They'll kill us.

25
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:10,108
Mama!

26
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,744
Animal!

27
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:17,943
Dax! Run. For God's sake, run! Find Papa!

28
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,516
- The chickens are dead.
- Where's your mother?

29
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,887
And my dog, Nina.

30
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,582
Your mother, boy.

31
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,624
She is dead. All are dead.

32
00:08:58,718 --> 00:08:59,810
Vera.

33
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,386
It's all safe now. Papa's here.

34
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,627
It is my duty to read to you
the following pronouncement.

35
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,336
"The Revolutionary Tribunal...

36
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:27,138
"for the Provisional Government
of the Republic of Corteguay...

37
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:30,473
"established on
the twenty-first day of March...

38
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,018
"1945...

39
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:38,416
"under the Presidency of His Excellency,
Gen. Rojo...

40
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,221
"charged with crimes...

41
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:44,555
- "with crimes against... "
- Guilty.

42
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,030
Death.

43
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,539
You, Jaime...

44
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,107
your wife, your daughter.

45
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,044
I am not an executioner.

46
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,721
- Let me kill them.
- No.

47
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,023
- I will.
- He's a child.

48
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,221
There are no children in war, only men.

49
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,457
Come here, boy.

50
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,741
Now, look at them.

51
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,414
Now say, "For Corteguay...

52
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:40,316
"for my mother, for my sister,
for Corteguay. "

53
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:44,314
"For my mother, for my sister,
for Corteguay. "

54
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,335
Gutierrez!

55
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,210
Gutierrez and more of his dogs. Many more.

56
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:44,010
- We ride.
- The boy?

57
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,277
To my family in the mountains. Fat Cat!

58
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,125
Take the boy to my hacienda.

59
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,663
Be brave, Dax.

60
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,631
I am not a child anymore.

61
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,334
No. You are not a child anymore.

62
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,901
Bless you, my son.

63
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,675
- Take care of my boy.
- With my life, señor.

64
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,580
Thank you.

65
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,813
Come.

66
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,989
Condor, we ride!

67
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:52,546
- Why are you always looking?
- We must be careful.

68
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,846
We do not want to meet that man Gutierrez.

69
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,522
This man, Gutierrez,
did he kill my mother and my sister?

70
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,016
Yes.

71
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,621
Then, one day, I shall kill him.

72
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,594
- Are you hungry?
- No.

73
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,764
One of the women of the farm
give me the breakfast.

74
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:12,669
- She was crying.
- Women always cry.

75
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,404
I don't cry.

76
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:19,377
Cry? You? You are a man. Men do not cry.

77
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,912
Papa cried at the graveside.

78
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,244
- I cried, too.
- Well, that was permissible.

79
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,286
Even I cried, but now we are men again.

80
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,649
Yes.

81
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,558
Sometimes it is not always easy
being a man.

82
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:39,864
But come, you follow me.
I will lead you safely through the mountains.

83
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,679
- Fat Cat. It's a great day.
- Why?

84
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:59,115
The General rides on Curatu.
Everywhere the people are with us.

85
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,146
Soon no more revolutions...

86
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,688
- because the way will be ours.
- Good.

87
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:25,004
Dax.

88
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:29,276
Yes, Dona Maria. His sister and mama...

89
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:31,913
Come here.

90
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,313
Poor little boy.

91
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,756
This is my son, Roberto.

92
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:43,561
Amparo, this is Dax. Señor Xenos' son.

93
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,688
You may kiss me.

94
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,741
Amparo, show Dax to his room
and then you both can play until dinner.

95
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,108
- Play?
- Games.

96
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:08,345
Games? I don't play games.

97
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:39,184
Petrucha says you've got rubber legs.

98
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,977
Better than a wooden head.

99
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:43,082
What are you doing?

100
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,986
I'm watching for Gutierrez.

101
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,998
It's Fat Cat.

102
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,874
- What are they doing?
- Playing.

103
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,397
- What are they doing now?
- I suppose he's raping her.

104
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,559
- Raping?
- He rapes her and she rapes him.

105
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:35,073
- Let's do it.
- No. You are too young.

106
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,800
And I think I have to kill you afterwards.

107
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,374
Fat Cat!

108
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,580
Mama.

109
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,036
Amparo!

110
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,745
Dax!

111
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:56,480
I want Mama.

112
00:18:57,216 --> 00:19:00,413
- Mama. Where is my Mama?
- Come on!

113
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,286
Amparo!

114
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,998
Mama!

115
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,638
What are they doing to Mama?

116
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,975
Nothing. Don't look.

117
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,283
They're all dead, Col. Gutierrez.

118
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:35,954
Gutierrez.

119
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:39,756
So much for the traitor, Diablo Rojo.

120
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,422
The rebels are advancing on Curatu.
Collect your men.

121
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:03,579
We must go.

122
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,480
I want Mama and Roberto.

123
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,782
We must go to Curatu. Come on.

124
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,356
Soldiers.

125
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,774
Petrucha.

126
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,748
Petrucha is dead. We must bury her.

127
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:49,649
God keep Petrucha...

128
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,756
Mama and Roberto.

129
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:20,745
Come to bed.

130
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:23,248
But we are not married.

131
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,754
All right, I marry you.

132
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,150
But now we go to sleep.

133
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,724
Is that all there is?

134
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,066
That's all.

135
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:40,804
Go to sleep.

136
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,117
Curatu.

137
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,720
Dax!

138
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:48,562
Amparo. Dax.

139
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,730
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

140
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,107
I thought you were both dead.

141
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,145
Why aren't you in the Palace?

142
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,409
How could I have faced them?

143
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,182
Come, I will take you to your fathers.

144
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:08,651
- Right.
- Come.

145
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,431
My dear friends...

146
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:34,376
now we will build a new Corteguay
for the people of Corteguay.

147
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,914
Food for all, justice for all, peace for all.

148
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,747
Yes. But at what cost?

149
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,591
- Daddy!
- Dax.

150
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:53,130
Amparo. My child.

151
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:59,198
Fat Cat, you didn't die.

152
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:02,196
I do not think so, señor.

153
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,538
How did you escape the massacre?

154
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:07,639
I...

155
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:11,547
He hid us from the soldiers,
and walked us all the way here.

156
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,244
No, it...

157
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:15,878
And he killed two men with his bare hands...

158
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:20,084
and there was snakes and scorpions
and he saved us from them.

159
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:24,289
We stole chickens, Papa, we ate grass.

160
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,296
Well, I could not get word to you.
They might have been caught.

161
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,459
In that case I would have had you shot.

162
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,231
Of course, General.

163
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:34,738
Thank you, Fat Cat.

164
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,704
Get them to bed, as soon as possible.

165
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:59,562
This time you took me safely
through the mountains...

166
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:02,228
I will never forget that.

167
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,230
How do you feel, Son?

168
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:15,172
There are great plans ahead, Dax.

169
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,081
We are going to Europe, to Italy.

170
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,281
I'm to be Ambassador of Corteguay in Rome.

171
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,217
- And Fat Cat?
- He'll come, too.

172
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,689
And Col. Gutierrez...

173
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:31,287
when can I kill him?

174
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,892
Dax, the fighting's over.

175
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,162
There will be no more violence.

176
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,668
I can't forget what he did.

177
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,503
You must.

178
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:47,304
We have to think now
only of Corteguay as it will be.

179
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:52,005
When you come back,
you won't be a boy anymore.

180
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,251
You'll be a man.

181
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:00,449
Now, good night, Dax.

182
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:02,688
And dream of Rome.

183
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:07,463
Good night, Papa.

184
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:26,506
- What are you doing here?
- I listened. You're going away.

185
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:29,586
Yeah, I'm going away forever.

186
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:34,024
No, you're not.
You'll come back and I'll marry you properly.

187
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,585
I'm never going to marry anyone.

188
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,156
I don't want a wife and family...

189
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,563
because the soldiers will come and kill them.

190
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,992
- Señor Xenos?
- Yes.

191
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:45,186
We've been expecting you.
My name is Marcel Campion.

192
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:49,222
I'm the Senior Clerk here. Please.

193
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,862
Signor Barone...

194
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,567
His Excellency Jaime Xenos,
our new Ambassador.

195
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,935
Your Excellency, il Barone de Coyne...

196
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,380
President of the de Coyne Bank.

197
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,214
My son, Dax.

198
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,386
I know of all you've done
for my country, Barone.

199
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:10,682
I'm deeply grateful.

200
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:12,279
No need, señor.

201
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:16,753
My family haven't achieved
an international reputation as bankers...

202
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,295
being philanthropic.

203
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:21,561
Here in Italy, the de Coyne bank...

204
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,898
invested money in Corteguay
as a matter of good business.

205
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,402
There are times
when one wonders, of course.

206
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,936
Your predecessor was frightened,
Your Excellency, and greedy.

207
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,205
- There is nothing left.
- No funds?

208
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,510
The de Coyne Bank has confidence
in your new regime, señor.

209
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:41,081
It would be a breach of faith
to withdraw our support now.

210
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:42,586
You are very kind.

211
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:45,917
Have you any plans for your son's schooling?

212
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:48,284
- I hadn't thought.
- Leave it to me then.

213
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,655
He shall go to the Institute della Rocca
with my son.

214
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:54,893
- I will make all the arrangements.
- I am overwhelmed.

215
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,524
Come and see me tomorrow.

216
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,161
We'll discuss the future of your son
and of Corteguay.

217
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,568
Thank you.

218
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:05,835
You'll continue to work here, Campion,
and keep me informed.

219
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,845
Unless I am offered something better.

220
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:11,410
This will encourage you to stay,
at least for the time being.

221
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:14,008
Of course, Signor Barone, thank you.

222
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:27,824
Robert.

223
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,000
How are you?

224
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,169
Robert, this is Dax. Look after him.

225
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,007
- Hello there, Robert.
- Hello, Sergei.

226
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,081
Prince Paul Nikovitch, Señor Xenos.

227
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:48,414
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

228
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,852
Sergei Nikovitch, a friend of Robert's.

229
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,651
Can we go now, Father?

230
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,282
Of course. Run along.

231
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,994
Goodbye, Father.

232
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,899
Goodbye, Father.

233
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:13,071
Fat Cat.

234
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,315
But why do I have to fight any of you?

235
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,982
To see whose room you share.

236
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:29,287
If you win, you could choose who you like.

237
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,386
All right then, I'll fight you.

238
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:34,389
Sergei wins all his fights.

239
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,492
Why not fight me? I always lose.

240
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,327
Thanks. But I have chosen already.

241
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:43,201
- Boxing or free-for-all?
- Free-for-all.

242
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,036
I choose you. For my roommate.

243
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,581
Sergei, take them in.

244
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:35,819
Robert, take them out.

245
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,714
Dax doesn't play polo, he wages war.

246
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,051
Isn't he wonderful, Father?

247
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:57,834
Bravo!

248
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,543
Come on, leave me alone.

249
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,713
- Hello, Father.
- Would you like champagne?

250
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:12,984
- Sergei.
- Hey, señor, Dax.

251
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:14,251
Thank you, Robert.

252
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:19,923
- Did you enjoy the match?
- You play a hard game.

253
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,260
I play to win.

254
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,868
Dax, I have to go to Corteguay.

255
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:27,234
- For long?
- Two or three weeks perhaps.

256
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:29,296
- I'll come with you.
- Not this time.

257
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:31,239
Stay young as long as you can.

258
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,970
Is there trouble in Corteguay?

259
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:36,406
There are rumors. I must see for myself.

260
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:40,106
You worry too much, Father.
You work too hard.

261
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,618
I love my country.

262
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,081
The revolution.
I live to see its promises fulfilled.

263
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:48,825
A toast. To patriotism.

264
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:52,055
No. To horses and pretty girls.

265
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,498
Go, and enjoy yourself.

266
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,867
- Thank you. See you later.
- Bye.

267
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,505
I'll give you a drink.

268
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,595
My father is away.
Let's have a party at the villa!

269
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,969
The last car at the villa,
the girl in it must pay a forfeit.

270
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,864
Why do you drive so fast?

271
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:16,007
Are you afraid I'll have to pay
the forfeit if you get there last?

272
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,947
I couldn't care less. I drive to win.

273
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,025
Beautiful, isn't it?

274
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,361
Like a dream.

275
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,036
One doesn't always have beautiful dreams.

276
00:38:58,383 --> 00:38:59,782
Come and swim.

277
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,016
- In five minutes at the pool.
- Yes.

278
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:48,320
Would you say...

279
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:51,827
it's quite in character
to leave me at the polo field...

280
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,394
bring that girl back here
to my father's house...

281
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:58,901
and then in the morning
make love to me, too?

282
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,333
Why not?

283
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:07,006
Why you don't feel a twinge of guilt
or of old-fashioned remorse?

284
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:09,706
Why feel guilt or remorse about love?

285
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:13,784
- Love?
- Well, about making love.

286
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:16,409
Love's just a word to you, isn't it?

287
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:20,380
But the way you behave can hurt.

288
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:22,886
I know bullets hurt.

289
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:26,088
- Knives hurt.
- And that's all?

290
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:28,758
You want me to apologize
for bringing that girl back?

291
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,097
- No, that's not the point.
- Then?

292
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:35,803
Well, I'd like to know what it is
you really care about.

293
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,366
You see, it isn't girls.

294
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,903
You don't make love to girls,
you make love at them.

295
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,342
If I could understand what you're saying.

296
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:48,010
Dax.

297
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:50,752
I love you.

298
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:58,760
If you could tell me what it feels like
to love.

299
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:31,522
You will appreciate, Signor Barone,
I felt it my duty.

300
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,658
I don't wish to cause trouble.

301
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:18,174
You'll wake her.

302
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,103
- Father?
- Yes.

303
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,281
Sergei.

304
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:51,474
Where is your sister?

305
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,114
Is she here?

306
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:00,346
No, she didn't come.

307
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:01,982
You disgrace me.

308
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:04,211
You disgrace the family.

309
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:08,523
Dax Xenos, Sergei, the rest of them
turning my house into a brothel.

310
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:12,654
I'll give you a last chance.
Get rid of them. All of them.

311
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,496
The whole pack.
Any more of this, I am finished.

312
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:21,468
Your credit, your allowance, finish.
Do you understand me?

313
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:30,106
You will speak of this to no one, Campion.

314
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:32,615
You may trust me implicitly, Signor Barone.

315
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:34,373
You mentioned...

316
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:37,080
you might find a better position
for me in your bank.

317
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:39,884
From Monday you'll be in charge
of the Shipping Department.

318
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:41,515
Thank you, Signor Barone.

319
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,552
My dear Jaime, welcome home.

320
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:19,355
An unexpected honor, Señor Presidente.

321
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:20,987
For an unexpected visit.

322
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,128
How's Dax?

323
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:28,462
He lives his own life.

324
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:33,736
That one will always make his own rules.
He's not afraid to walk alone.

325
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:35,711
And Amparo, how is she?

326
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:37,737
She's well...

327
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:40,183
at a convent school in the country.

328
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,183
But tell me more about Dax.

329
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:46,587
He's mad about polo.
I think he may play for Italy.

330
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:19,521
Viva Rojo!

331
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:28,264
- The old Palace of Justice.
- Now obsolete.

332
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,060
The new palace of the President.

333
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:34,195
But there were houses, streets,
the marketplace.

334
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:38,267
All swept away.
Now the Plaza del Presidente Rojo.

335
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:41,209
The people voted unanimously
to give it my name.

336
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:44,047
Including the people who lived there?

337
00:46:44,482 --> 00:46:46,074
The people have no gratitude.

338
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:49,313
I give them progress and what do they do?

339
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:52,449
You heard that El Condor
is now against me?

340
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:54,188
El Condor?

341
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:57,957
- But El Condor was our friend.
- No, Jaime.

342
00:46:58,462 --> 00:47:01,260
Ask a man to be your friend
and he feels indebted to you.

343
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:05,290
I don't trust friends.
But enemies, real enemies...

344
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,497
I trust them implicitly.

345
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:10,739
Magnificent, huh?

346
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:16,006
Take this old man, El Condor.

347
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:19,444
I know what he wants. To destroy me.

348
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:22,642
If he tries, he knows what I shall do.

349
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,279
We understand each other. We're enemies.

350
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:28,223
There's no pretense, but with a friend...

351
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:44,931
The Cabinet Room.

352
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,107
Magnificent, huh?

353
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:51,908
Was all the money I begged
for Corteguay poured into this?

354
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:55,713
My dear friend, we did not fight for this.

355
00:47:56,353 --> 00:47:59,447
Our wives and children did not die for this.

356
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:02,690
This is not worth one drop
of their precious blood.

357
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:05,194
I see you learned nothing in Rome.

358
00:48:06,463 --> 00:48:08,522
A nation's glory is in its architecture.

359
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,126
Then build houses for the people,
not palaces for yourself.

360
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:15,036
And how many houses do you think
I could've built for them?

361
00:48:15,105 --> 00:48:17,505
A few thousand for some of the people.

362
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:18,699
No!

363
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,468
I built one palace for all the people.

364
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:28,750
But you're here on holiday. You need a rest.

365
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:31,444
How long do you intend to stay?

366
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,990
I'm at your service, Señor Presidente.

367
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:37,589
But I'd like to go to my hacienda
to visit my wife's grave.

368
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,685
Of course.

369
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:10,824
El Condor.

370
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,024
Thank you for coming, Jaime.

371
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:17,226
But nobody knows you're here?

372
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:19,434
- Nobody.
- You've seen Rojo?

373
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:23,568
- Yes.
- Then you've seen the devil.

374
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,539
He's 10 times worse than the last.

375
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:30,543
Palaces, roads, guns, soldiers...

376
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:32,972
and the people starve.

377
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,381
I've seen them.

378
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:37,648
Have you seen the prisons,
the execution yards...

379
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:41,083
the bodies rotting in the pits,
a feast for vultures?

380
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:44,723
I told the President he was wrong.

381
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,492
You told him?

382
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:50,158
And you are wrong to take up arms again.

383
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:53,665
Hasn't this poor country
seen enough of civil war?

384
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:56,365
Enough? No, not enough.

385
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,574
Are we women to be beaten and oppressed?

386
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:01,076
- There are legal ways.
- There's only one way.

387
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:05,570
Have you forgotten the things
we once fought for, Jaime Xenos?

388
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:08,174
We fight for justice with justice.

389
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:12,948
You mustn't use the weapons of tyranny
even against a tyrant.

390
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:15,355
How else can you destroy him?

391
00:50:18,395 --> 00:50:20,522
So long as Rojo rules by force...

392
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:23,462
I will oppose him by force.

393
00:50:40,984 --> 00:50:42,747
Sit down, Gutierrez.

394
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:44,618
Thank you.

395
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:55,256
Well?

396
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,591
Friendship is a wonderful thing,
Señor Presidente.

397
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:00,068
Friendship?

398
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,503
- You're not my friend.
- No indeed.

399
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:11,175
Just an old enemy.
Too useful not to be employed.

400
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:14,350
Must you always play games, Colonel?

401
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:17,715
I am naturally devious, Señor Presidente.

402
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:22,989
However, you had a friend, Jaime Xenos.

403
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:27,191
- Had?
- He's gone to see another old friend.

404
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:30,028
They're talking, reminiscing no doubt...

405
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:32,201
as old friends will.

406
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,764
What friend?

407
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:36,703
El Condor.

408
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:47,010
Jaime Xenos and El Condor.

409
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:59,422
Why do you always bring bad news,
Gutierrez?

410
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:02,557
A Chief of Security never brings good news.

411
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:04,567
There's no gratitude, Gutierrez.

412
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:07,334
They envy me.

413
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,040
I who made this country great.

414
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,804
They envy me, my position in history.

415
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:18,110
Jaime Xenos and El Condor.

416
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:22,881
A bandit alone is nothing but a bandit.

417
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:24,921
A bandit and a lawyer...

418
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,455
is a revolution.

419
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,825
The honor conferred on me
by El Presidente in allowing me...

420
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:35,262
to open the cable line to Mirados...

421
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:39,530
and be the first to cross
this great chasm with his greetings.

422
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,336
El Presidente is the head of our nation...

423
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:46,940
but the body, the hands, the heart,
and the soul are our people...

424
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:51,413
and I take their greetings to the people
of Mirados in the sure conviction...

425
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:56,848
that we shall march together
to a bright future of peace and prosperity.

426
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:58,612
Thank you.

427
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:42,119
Breathe in.

428
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:45,922
Good, you'll live.

429
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,822
Yes?

430
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:50,529
Just a minute.

431
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:55,368
God, 3:00.

432
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:58,036
Morning or afternoon?

433
00:54:58,642 --> 00:54:59,904
Morning.

434
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,938
Fat Cat, do you know what time it is?

435
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:10,375
All right. I'll come.

436
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:15,586
When am I going to see you again?

437
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:18,586
When I call you.

438
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,653
Fire!

439
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:27,254
I should have gone with him.
He was the last.

440
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:37,591
Dax.

441
00:57:48,044 --> 00:57:49,944
Don't you remember me?

442
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:53,073
We were children together.

443
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,478
Amparo.

444
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:58,452
So long ago, but I don't forget.

445
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,442
I loved him.

446
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:27,544
Tragedy.

447
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,450
Something no one could have foreseen.

448
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,148
It might have happened to me,
I shall never forget that.

449
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:34,520
I feel...

450
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:36,820
a responsibility to you.

451
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:40,286
You've always been like a son to me.

452
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:44,960
Dax, your father gave his life for Corteguay.

453
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:47,733
I want you to take his place.

454
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:49,704
I'm not fit to take his place.

455
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,168
That's not true.

456
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:55,606
You're a Corteguayan. A Xenos.

457
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,973
I'm a Corteguayan who lives in Rome.

458
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:02,812
A Xenos, yes,
the last of my family and the least.

459
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:04,979
A man should never condemn himself...

460
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:07,888
there are always others
who are willing to do it for him.

461
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:21,629
Did your father ever speak to you
of El Condor?

462
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,764
I know who you mean.

463
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:28,873
Once our comrade, still a rebel.

464
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:33,974
I've tried everything
to make peace with him.

465
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:37,510
Offered him amnesty.

466
00:59:40,257 --> 00:59:42,248
Dax, now I want you to try.

467
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:45,388
Give him anything he asks for.

468
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:48,929
A free pardon, safe conduct for his men.

469
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:51,730
Food and medicine
for the women and children.

470
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:55,494
You're a Xenos, he'll listen to you.

471
00:59:58,141 --> 01:00:00,302
I'm not a politician, Señor Xenos.

472
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:03,379
I'm only a simple murderer.

473
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:06,441
But this I do know.

474
01:00:07,284 --> 01:00:10,776
I don't want my son to spend
the rest of his life in these hills.

475
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:13,254
Hunted day and night.

476
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:18,418
El Presidente guarantees peace.

477
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:21,459
You'll be a respected citizen of Corteguay.

478
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,225
Once I had eight sons and three daughters.

479
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:29,395
They're all dead now.

480
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,374
All but this one.

481
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:34,767
No one will be harmed.

482
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:37,039
El Presidente promised it.

483
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:39,539
These are Rojo's promises.

484
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,584
He asks you to trust him, El Condor.

485
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:43,948
There will be no reprisals.

486
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,348
An honorable peace.

487
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:49,122
If you will guarantee the safety of my son...

488
01:00:49,826 --> 01:00:51,316
you personally...

489
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,628
swearing on the soul of your father
and on the cross...

490
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:57,658
then I will accept El Presidente's offer.

491
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,032
I swear it.

492
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:07,139
Very well then.

493
01:01:07,944 --> 01:01:11,175
Tell Rojo I'll meet him in Asiento
on the last day of this month.

494
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:14,478
There will be no more war between us.

495
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:23,626
My father's very pleased with you.
You know that?

496
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:26,661
The question is what now?

497
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:28,826
You mean do you stay?

498
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,030
Do you want to?

499
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:34,931
I don't know. I don't feel involved.

500
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:37,600
Come with me.

501
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,857
When you were a child,
you killed seven men with that gun.

502
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:00,793
I remember that.

503
01:02:02,832 --> 01:02:05,062
I pleaded with your father to let me do it.

504
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:08,101
Like it or not, Dax, you are involved.

505
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:12,936
All right. I'll be involved with the future...

506
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,377
but not the past.

507
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:20,745
The past has its uses, too, you know.

508
01:02:21,217 --> 01:02:22,241
No.

509
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:25,113
None.

510
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:32,988
Do you remember when you dragged me,
complaining across the mountains?

511
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:35,063
Yeah, I remember that.

512
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:36,826
And we slept in the forest?

513
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:40,992
And you made me marry you.

514
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:47,576
- Yes.
- And before that we sat in the reeds.

515
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:51,046
Fat Cat was in the stream
with one of the maids.

516
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:53,646
You asked me what they were doing.

517
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,775
And I said "He rapes her. "

518
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:58,443
"And she rapes him. "

519
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,053
- That's right.
- We were very young.

520
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:09,985
Viva!

521
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:30,942
Viva El Condor!

522
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:18,492
Diablo Rojo.

523
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:21,255
I have come in response to your request.

524
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:24,325
I accept your offer of amnesty.

525
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,197
Let there be peace between us.

526
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:58,863
In the name of Corteguay, I pledge my faith.

527
01:05:59,402 --> 01:06:02,838
In the name of Corteguay,
I hope you keep it.

528
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:15,279
You see, I've kept my word.

529
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:19,284
Now Jose can go to school
and learn to behave like a gentleman.

530
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:22,458
Well, at least he can learn
to read and write.

531
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:24,891
Come inside, my friend,
and have some champagne.

532
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:29,122
Give me the red wine of Corteguay.
And keep that cat's piss for the women.

533
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:49,471
I'm sure the good God will be glad to see
his house put to useful service again.

534
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:42,561
No!

535
01:09:58,241 --> 01:09:59,572
Gutierrez.

536
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:33,105
Dax Xenos.

537
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:36,742
I have my orders.

538
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:38,707
He was a traitor.

539
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:55,127
I have no orders to kill you.

540
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:59,566
But if I must, I will.

541
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:27,383
I heard guns firing.

542
01:12:42,872 --> 01:12:44,362
You did this.

543
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:47,333
- You!
- No.

544
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:49,467
I didn't know.

545
01:12:49,779 --> 01:12:52,748
You promised him! And you lied!

546
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:56,109
- Believe me, I didn't know.
- You lie!

547
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,315
Some day I shall kill you for this.

548
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,351
- Jose!
- No.

549
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:09,458
Let him go. Back to the mountains
where he'll be safe.

550
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:16,630
Gutierrez, explain Gutierrez.

551
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:21,672
He was there carrying out your orders.

552
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:25,545
- No.
- He said so.

553
01:13:27,116 --> 01:13:28,310
Then he lied.

554
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:31,284
He lied, Dax, and he shall answer for it.

555
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:34,254
He has answered, to me.

556
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:37,051
I see.

557
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:45,691
Do you deny he was working for you...

558
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:50,004
the man who killed
most of your family and mine?

559
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:55,702
- You employed him.
- Yes, I did.

560
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:58,913
And me?

561
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,010
Did you employ me, too?

562
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,710
To lie for you? Betray for you?

563
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:08,550
A man must use what weapons he can
to defend his country, Dax.

564
01:14:08,624 --> 01:14:10,922
- Treachery?
- Treachery is a weapon.

565
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,621
- You admit you used me?
- I've loved you, Dax.

566
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:16,455
As a boy and as a man.

567
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,264
What is love but the use
of one person by another?

568
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:24,298
No.

569
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,271
- Then, for the love of Corteguay.
- Words.

570
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:33,538
Words with no meaning to them.

571
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:42,947
I trusted you.

572
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:48,687
I would have done anything for you!

573
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:51,965
And you?

574
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:58,234
I leave...

575
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:03,505
- I leave for Europe tomorrow.
- Yes, go.

576
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:07,580
I order you to go.

577
01:15:08,517 --> 01:15:10,348
And understand this, Dax.

578
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:14,154
Until you've learned that evil and politics
must tolerate each other...

579
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,054
there's no place for you here.

580
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:18,722
Please, Dax, take me with you.

581
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:21,486
No.

582
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:25,730
Your place is here with me.

583
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:27,432
Not anymore.

584
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:31,598
I've seen too much suffering and misery.

585
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:35,302
- And now this.
- You are my daughter.

586
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:38,504
A daughter of the President.

587
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:41,545
You expect me to take pride in that?

588
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:43,579
I expect nothing of you.

589
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:47,146
I order you to stay. You stay.

590
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:51,120
And you go, Dax...

591
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:54,219
while you can.

592
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:35,428
Such a small country, and so much blood.

593
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:41,209
I should have brought Amparo with me.

594
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:45,004
She was all I had left of my childhood.

595
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:48,777
You know...

596
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:51,818
I have nothing now.

597
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:54,820
No money, nothing.

598
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:58,455
You are alive and I am still here.

599
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:01,053
Yes.

600
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,192
And someday when you are rich again,
you can come back.

601
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:05,824
To more bloodshed?

602
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:08,763
- More misery?
- To put an end to it.

603
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:11,162
There will come a day.

604
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,503
Do you think I care
about that patch of scrub?

605
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:19,372
- Yes.
- Yes, maybe I do.

606
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:24,517
But if I ever come back,
it won't be to help Rojo.

607
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:27,884
I'll have money.

608
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:30,486
I'll do anything to get money.

609
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:33,995
Money and power,
and then I shall I come back.

610
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:05,190
Capt. Dax reporting, sir.

611
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,286
What time do you call this?
I'm starving. Is this all?

612
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,107
- You've spilt wine on my suit.
- Our suit.

613
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,848
This chicken's over-cooked.

614
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:35,822
You're lucky to get anything.
We had trouble at the restaurant.

615
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:37,381
The Baron stopped Robert's credit.

616
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:40,326
- How did you pay?
- We didn't. The girls did.

617
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:43,493
- Good.
- No, you don't seem to realize.

618
01:18:43,799 --> 01:18:46,199
My father has disowned me.
Now we're really broke.

619
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:47,929
How about your father?

620
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:51,461
I can try, but he's done too much already.
He's not rich, you know.

621
01:19:14,063 --> 01:19:15,257
Sergei.

622
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:21,632
- Papa.
- I am indeed privileged.

623
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,601
It's rare to see you.

624
01:19:23,672 --> 01:19:25,196
Still scrawling away?

625
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:28,107
- I'm still designing clothes.
- Which never get made.

626
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:30,005
Not yet.

627
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:31,903
When I left Russia...

628
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:35,609
I slaved to give you the education
an aristocrat deserves...

629
01:19:36,085 --> 01:19:39,020
but you don't even seem able to make
a success of dress-making.

630
01:19:39,088 --> 01:19:40,851
- Designing.
- Yes.

631
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:46,391
If I had some capital, Papa...

632
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:50,762
No. I don't want money from you.

633
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,802
Nonsense. I never see you unless you do.

634
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:58,003
Thank you.

635
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:02,007
I have to go now. I'm on duty.

636
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:06,111
Duty is an older coinage than money.

637
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:10,741
When I was a young man
at the court of Czar Nicholas...

638
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,083
I learned the meaning of both.

639
01:20:14,623 --> 01:20:15,954
Yes, Papa.

640
01:20:26,602 --> 01:20:27,762
There.

641
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:31,096
A title needs a good uniform,
don't you think?

642
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:32,504
Yes, Papa.

643
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,651
- Hello there.
- Hello, Marcel.

644
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:49,153
- April.
- Hi, Marcel.

645
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:52,193
You haven't met Dax.
Robert de Coyne. Sergei.

646
01:20:52,294 --> 01:20:53,488
- Hello.
- April Stavronis.

647
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:54,824
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

648
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:56,888
April and I are engaged to be married.

649
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:58,794
Married?

650
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,392
- Since when?
- Last night.

651
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,698
Congratulate us.

652
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:04,502
- We do.
- We do.

653
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:05,835
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

654
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:08,172
- You're a lucky man, Marcel.
- I know that.

655
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,874
Darling, will you give me five minutes?

656
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:13,278
Yes. I have to go down and change anyhow.

657
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:15,082
Well, I'll see you later.

658
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,208
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

659
01:21:16,285 --> 01:21:17,684
See you later.

660
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,846
My God, Marcel. She's a dog.

661
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:23,449
But a rich dog.
You've heard of Stavronis Munitions.

662
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:26,154
You should do the same, my boy.

663
01:21:26,995 --> 01:21:29,987
As a matter of fact,
that's why we asked you to meet us, Marcel.

664
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:32,158
We are going into business, all of us.

665
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:34,600
- A dress salon.
- What a good idea.

666
01:21:34,803 --> 01:21:38,034
We'll start with a fabulous show
in some ancient Roman setting.

667
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,266
Who's financing you?

668
01:21:39,341 --> 01:21:41,536
That's where we need your advice, Marcel.

669
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:44,602
All we need is some capital
to get us started.

670
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:47,843
- And what do you offer as collateral?
- Collateral?

671
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:51,619
As security against the loss of the money
advanced to you.

672
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:56,385
In business there is no such thing
as a loan without collateral.

673
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:15,567
There's your capital and no collateral.

674
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:27,779
There are plenty more like her in Rome.

675
01:22:28,223 --> 01:22:31,852
Americans, tourist, rich, lonely, bored.

676
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,319
I know of one or two likely prospects.

677
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:38,125
I could introduce you.

678
01:22:38,967 --> 01:22:40,195
Sergei?

679
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:43,133
It's disgusting. I like it.

680
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:47,664
Dax?

681
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:52,106
Robert?

682
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:55,107
Look, I am sorry,
I don't think this is for me.

683
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:57,344
- Why?
- Well, it's just that...

684
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:01,612
- You don't mind, do you?
- It's all right.

685
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:07,252
That will cost you thirty-three
and one-third percent of anything you get.

686
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,533
-15%.
-25%.

687
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:14,862
Done!

688
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,165
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

689
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:18,672
Four champagne cocktails.

690
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:22,335
And put them on Miss Stavronis' bill.
Room 409.

691
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,945
A little kiss?

692
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,022
You're very handsome, you know that?

693
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:37,456
Then we must be
the best-looking couple in Rome.

694
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:42,530
Your husband is in business
in Chicago, Mrs. Erickson?

695
01:23:42,597 --> 01:23:44,224
Yeah, he's a meat baron.

696
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,895
- Sounds impressive.
- It's disgusting.

697
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:49,459
Raw, red meat, that's all he's interested in.

698
01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:52,632
Then we'll go to a restaurant
that serves the best fish in Rome.

699
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:54,773
Wonderful.

700
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,709
You need some money?

701
01:23:57,512 --> 01:23:58,809
If you like.

702
01:24:04,886 --> 01:24:06,012
Thank you.

703
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,988
- Enough?
- Yes, for the taxi.

704
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:09,650
Funny boy.

705
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:14,286
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

706
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,570
Thank you.

707
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:58,936
Good evening. Mrs. Hadley?

708
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:01,166
Yes, that's me.

709
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:03,873
You must be...

710
01:25:05,113 --> 01:25:06,444
Dax Xenos.

711
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:08,780
Won't you come in?

712
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:39,170
Marcel has told me all about you.

713
01:25:39,714 --> 01:25:41,011
Has he?

714
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:48,454
Really, it's just that
I don't know anyone in Rome and...

715
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:52,689
You need someone
to show you the sights and...

716
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:53,989
That's right.

717
01:25:55,197 --> 01:25:58,325
I mean, not the Coliseum and St. Peter's.

718
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,767
I'm not quite as provincial as that.

719
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,102
I can see you are not.

720
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:13,577
Maybe this whole thing's a little ridiculous?

721
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:20,185
Why don't we have a drink
and then decide that?

722
01:26:22,057 --> 01:26:23,388
All right.

723
01:26:26,628 --> 01:26:28,960
- Scotch?
- Yes, please.

724
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:32,929
- On the rocks?
- Straight.

725
01:26:33,768 --> 01:26:35,030
Straight.

726
01:26:42,677 --> 01:26:46,340
- Where do you come from, Mrs. Hadley?
- California.

727
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:50,780
My husband's in oil.

728
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:54,716
That must be very uncomfortable for him.

729
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:06,166
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

730
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:28,115
You look five years younger this morning.

731
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:30,621
That makes 15 years in three days.

732
01:27:30,692 --> 01:27:34,219
By the time I go home...
I don't want to think about that.

733
01:27:34,563 --> 01:27:35,825
Nor do I.

734
01:27:36,264 --> 01:27:39,256
- Do you mean that?
- Yes. I mean it.

735
01:27:40,502 --> 01:27:42,299
Then I'm happy again.

736
01:27:47,576 --> 01:27:49,635
Good morning, Baron. Nice to see you.

737
01:27:50,045 --> 01:27:51,239
Indeed?

738
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:52,946
Allow me to introduce...

739
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:56,209
Il Barone de Coyne, Mrs. Deborah Hadley.

740
01:27:56,651 --> 01:27:58,084
Glad to meet you, Baron.

741
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:01,683
Mrs. Hadley is over here on vacation
from the States.

742
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:04,156
I hope you're enjoying your visit, signora.

743
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:07,752
Indeed I am. But who could not
in Rome on a day like this?

744
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:10,930
True. And now, if you'll excuse us?

745
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,802
Baron, who is that man?

746
01:28:23,311 --> 01:28:25,279
Pretty girl, who is she?

747
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,777
He's nothing.

748
01:28:26,915 --> 01:28:29,042
If you meet him again, please ignore him.

749
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:31,079
He's a very dangerous man.

750
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:36,756
Sue Ann Daley.

751
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:40,394
They say before long she's going to be
the richest girl in the world.

752
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:44,462
Now, what would you like to do
this afternoon?

753
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:57,471
Only one more day.

754
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:02,339
Then we won't waste it.

755
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,045
I was never young in America.

756
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:11,582
But you're going home.

757
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:16,686
To your family,
to things that really matter to you.

758
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,868
How do you know what matters to me?

759
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,633
I can't go back.

760
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,107
Of course you can.

761
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,179
You have to.

762
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,381
Don't make it difficult for me, too.

763
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:45,024
All my married life, there was no one else.

764
01:29:46,928 --> 01:29:48,486
And now...

765
01:29:58,006 --> 01:29:59,803
I've got a present for you.

766
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:17,021
Thank you.

767
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:23,153
It's beautiful.

768
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:44,442
The most beautiful cigarette case
I have ever possessed.

769
01:30:47,188 --> 01:30:48,314
Thanks.

770
01:33:12,834 --> 01:33:15,530
Thank you, signore, signori.

771
01:33:15,603 --> 01:33:17,662
I must tell you, signore, signori...

772
01:33:17,739 --> 01:33:20,105
that none of this
would have been possible without...

773
01:33:20,174 --> 01:33:23,473
the generous assistance
of Mrs. Lafayette Erickson.

774
01:33:23,544 --> 01:33:25,068
Mrs. Erickson?

775
01:33:29,717 --> 01:33:32,777
And I must also thank
my friend and partner...

776
01:33:32,854 --> 01:33:35,345
Dax Xenos, who has worked so hard...

777
01:33:35,423 --> 01:33:38,017
and so enthusiastically
to make this show a success.

778
01:33:38,259 --> 01:33:39,351
Dax?

779
01:33:43,064 --> 01:33:46,932
Lastly, I would like to thank Julius Caesar
for the loan of the hall. Thank you.

780
01:33:48,036 --> 01:33:50,163
I don't know what you see
in that young man.

781
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:52,331
If you ask me he's a goddamned fairy.

782
01:33:59,781 --> 01:34:01,271
The wedding dress. We'll buy it.

783
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:04,716
For the wedding of the year,
the bride must have the dress of the year.

784
01:34:04,786 --> 01:34:06,481
I'm sure she can afford it.

785
01:34:10,124 --> 01:34:13,560
I met a divine painter in London,
and we put on this show for him.

786
01:34:13,628 --> 01:34:16,324
He was terrific,
he'd put a little squiggle here...

787
01:34:16,397 --> 01:34:18,160
Do you know Sue Ann Daley?

788
01:34:18,933 --> 01:34:20,230
Only by sight.

789
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:22,667
My father's one of her trustees.

790
01:34:22,737 --> 01:34:24,500
We were friends at school.

791
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:28,971
The way you are looking at her,
you won't be friends much longer.

792
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:33,077
Excuse me.

793
01:34:38,886 --> 01:34:42,720
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm Dax Xenos.

794
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:45,087
I know.

795
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:49,594
I'm told you're the kind of person
who's only interested in my money.

796
01:34:50,431 --> 01:34:52,331
- Is that true?
- Of course.

797
01:34:52,967 --> 01:34:55,492
A hideous girl like you,
what else could it be?

798
01:34:56,938 --> 01:34:59,805
Anyway, I didn't say I was interested.

799
01:35:01,175 --> 01:35:03,837
- Hello.
- Is it a success?

800
01:35:03,911 --> 01:35:06,971
Yes, I think so,
but nobody except Marcel bought anything.

801
01:35:07,048 --> 01:35:08,811
I'd like to buy.

802
01:35:08,883 --> 01:35:11,681
- Buy what, Miss Daley?
- Everything.

803
01:35:12,253 --> 01:35:14,813
Everything? The collection?

804
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:17,290
Everything and the collection.

805
01:35:18,326 --> 01:35:21,295
Well, thank you, I'm honored and rich.
Thank you.

806
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:27,658
Who's that man who keeps following you?

807
01:35:28,536 --> 01:35:29,901
Big Dennis.

808
01:35:30,138 --> 01:35:32,436
- Detective?
- Nanny.

809
01:35:34,976 --> 01:35:36,307
Three weeks more.

810
01:38:33,521 --> 01:38:35,148
Good evening, Baron.

811
01:38:35,223 --> 01:38:38,056
Madame, sir. You have a beautiful home.

812
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:41,094
You are too kind.
I have heard so much about you.

813
01:38:41,162 --> 01:38:45,030
As Miss Daley's Trustees, we are happy
to welcome her friends tonight.

814
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,166
But I'm not aware that you were invited.

815
01:38:48,236 --> 01:38:50,761
Thank you. I'm delighted to be here.

816
01:38:51,038 --> 01:38:52,903
- Hello, Caroline.
- Hello.

817
01:38:59,981 --> 01:39:02,882
- Congratulations, darling, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

818
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,713
- Hello, Sue Ann.
- Hi.

819
01:39:06,721 --> 01:39:08,621
- Sue Ann.
- Yeah.

820
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:11,621
- Hi.
- Hello.

821
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:19,156
- You look wonderful tonight.
- Thanks.

822
01:39:22,303 --> 01:39:23,600
You know what?

823
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:25,366
For the first time in my life...

824
01:39:25,973 --> 01:39:27,804
I'm actually refusing food.

825
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:32,737
Maybe for the first time in your life,
you're happy.

826
01:39:32,913 --> 01:39:34,107
Maybe.

827
01:39:38,452 --> 01:39:41,182
Big Dennis, your time's running out,
you know.

828
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:43,448
Good evening.

829
01:39:49,563 --> 01:39:51,224
I might rather miss him.

830
01:39:53,701 --> 01:39:56,329
- Suppose I get lonely?
- I'll be here.

831
01:39:57,672 --> 01:39:58,832
Will you?

832
01:40:04,512 --> 01:40:05,672
Hello.

833
01:40:06,847 --> 01:40:09,611
Let's talk about my next collection.
And dance.

834
01:40:28,369 --> 01:40:30,894
- Marriage suits you, April.
- I'm very happy.

835
01:40:31,205 --> 01:40:33,571
- You should try it.
- No, thank you.

836
01:40:33,908 --> 01:40:37,002
Marriage is one of the few temptations
I've always resisted.

837
01:40:37,211 --> 01:40:40,738
Why don't you let yourself go for once
and marry me?

838
01:40:41,515 --> 01:40:44,006
Unfortunately,
your father doesn't approve of me.

839
01:40:44,118 --> 01:40:47,815
You mean he wouldn't keep you in the
style to which you've become accustomed?

840
01:40:48,155 --> 01:40:49,417
Possibly.

841
01:41:18,386 --> 01:41:19,876
Happy birthday!

842
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:39,934
I'm free!

843
01:41:41,642 --> 01:41:44,167
- Tell me.
- No, you tell me.

844
01:41:44,245 --> 01:41:45,507
- I love you.
- What?

845
01:41:45,579 --> 01:41:46,944
I love you.

846
01:41:55,856 --> 01:41:57,824
Many happy returns!

847
01:43:34,822 --> 01:43:36,847
As Miss Daley's Trustees...

848
01:43:37,157 --> 01:43:40,024
we will authorize the payment of $400,000...

849
01:43:40,194 --> 01:43:42,754
and an allowance of $4,000 a month...

850
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:45,697
both to take effect
after the wedding ceremony.

851
01:43:50,304 --> 01:43:54,263
I don't really think I could make Miss Daley
very happy on a pittance like that.

852
01:43:54,341 --> 01:43:56,400
Then what do you think you should have?

853
01:44:01,215 --> 01:44:03,683
When a man's wife is heiress
to $80 million...

854
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:06,151
he can't walk around
with pennies in his pocket.

855
01:44:06,921 --> 01:44:09,651
What kind of an impression
would that make?

856
01:44:09,723 --> 01:44:13,523
Would $500,000 and $5,000 a month
make a better impression?

857
01:44:17,131 --> 01:44:18,393
Slightly.

858
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:21,663
If you multiply it by two.

859
01:44:21,735 --> 01:44:23,703
- By two.
- Nonsense.

860
01:44:24,972 --> 01:44:27,463
We are totally opposed
to this marriage, Xenos.

861
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:29,641
We know what you are.

862
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:32,543
And it's our duty to protect Miss Daley
as far as we can.

863
01:44:32,846 --> 01:44:35,644
$500,000 and $5,000 a month
is our last offer.

864
01:44:36,584 --> 01:44:38,176
Well, that's a pity.

865
01:44:40,688 --> 01:44:44,818
It looks so bad for the heir to one of
the largest fortunes in the world...

866
01:44:45,192 --> 01:44:46,591
to be a bastard.

867
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:48,491
Heir? What heir?

868
01:44:52,566 --> 01:44:55,364
From Miss Daley's gynecologist.

869
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:34,630
I'm sorry.

870
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:42,544
Now, take it easy. He'll be here, I promise.

871
01:45:42,616 --> 01:45:43,981
Well, where is he then?

872
01:45:48,255 --> 01:45:49,813
Damn him. He's so late.

873
01:45:49,890 --> 01:45:51,721
Where was he last night?

874
01:45:51,859 --> 01:45:54,589
The stag party went on until breakfast, so...

875
01:45:55,663 --> 01:45:57,961
This is really humiliating.

876
01:46:00,601 --> 01:46:02,967
Well, it's the last time he marries me.

877
01:46:06,373 --> 01:46:08,933
- I'm beginning to feel hungry again.
- No.

878
01:46:28,429 --> 01:46:29,657
Oh, God.

879
01:46:34,201 --> 01:46:35,600
Where have you been?

880
01:46:40,774 --> 01:46:42,241
Come along, will you?

881
01:47:30,657 --> 01:47:33,353
Fat Cat. Welcome back.

882
01:47:38,899 --> 01:47:41,959
Dax will be so glad to see you.
He's missed you.

883
01:47:42,603 --> 01:47:43,900
Sit down.

884
01:47:51,378 --> 01:47:52,675
Where is he?

885
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:59,783
You've known Dax most of his life,
haven't you?

886
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:06,456
You don't think I can make him happy,
do you?

887
01:48:06,827 --> 01:48:10,160
Do you think you can, signora?
That is what matters.

888
01:48:10,564 --> 01:48:11,929
I don't know.

889
01:48:13,433 --> 01:48:16,231
I want him to feel for me
as I do for him, but...

890
01:48:18,138 --> 01:48:20,971
Dax does not feel things like other men.

891
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:22,440
For women, you mean?

892
01:48:22,843 --> 01:48:24,572
Women. Everything.

893
01:48:24,845 --> 01:48:27,006
He just does not feel.

894
01:48:28,248 --> 01:48:29,545
That's why...

895
01:48:33,287 --> 01:48:36,222
When the baby comes
that'll make a difference, won't it?

896
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:39,420
It could.

897
01:48:40,027 --> 01:48:41,517
Yes, it could.

898
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,737
- You'll get me all wet, you.
- Where have you been all these weeks?

899
01:48:56,810 --> 01:48:59,836
Well, you think I cannot get along
without you?

900
01:49:00,581 --> 01:49:01,980
- Here.
- What?

901
01:49:02,049 --> 01:49:05,485
I've brought this for you to see.
From my cousin in Corteguay.

902
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:07,013
Read it.

903
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:14,184
- Pretty bad, huh?
- Well...

904
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:17,663
the sugar crops are ruined
by storms every year.

905
01:49:18,665 --> 01:49:22,863
And the Secret Police,
the curfew, and the prison camps.

906
01:49:24,371 --> 01:49:25,838
That is Corteguay.

907
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,171
It always will be.

908
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:30,906
Until someone stops it.

909
01:49:33,814 --> 01:49:35,281
It can't be stopped.

910
01:49:38,785 --> 01:49:40,582
- Dax.
- Yes?

911
01:49:40,654 --> 01:49:42,315
Come push me, Dax.

912
01:49:48,595 --> 01:49:50,187
Push me higher, Dax.

913
01:49:58,872 --> 01:50:00,237
Higher.

914
01:50:09,716 --> 01:50:11,115
Higher now.

915
01:50:15,789 --> 01:50:16,915
Sue Ann.

916
01:50:23,063 --> 01:50:24,621
Are you all right?

917
01:50:26,633 --> 01:50:27,998
I think so.

918
01:50:36,276 --> 01:50:37,937
Oh, no.

919
01:50:52,693 --> 01:50:55,321
They've told you, haven't they,
that I lost the baby?

920
01:50:56,697 --> 01:50:57,823
Yes.

921
01:51:00,033 --> 01:51:02,433
When you get out of here,
we'll go away somewhere.

922
01:51:06,473 --> 01:51:07,940
I should like that.

923
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:11,572
Forgive me.

924
01:51:14,481 --> 01:51:15,948
I'm so sorry.

925
01:51:17,918 --> 01:51:19,180
I know.

926
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:23,018
You wanted it to be a boy.

927
01:51:24,224 --> 01:51:25,623
So did I.

928
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:32,291
We'll try again.

929
01:51:34,134 --> 01:51:36,364
And next time we'll have a perfect baby.

930
01:51:38,538 --> 01:51:40,369
I'll nurse myself like an invalid.

931
01:51:40,807 --> 01:51:43,640
I won't swim. I won't dance.

932
01:51:44,878 --> 01:51:46,846
I won't even sit on a swing.

933
01:51:48,515 --> 01:51:51,643
And I'll present you with
the fattest little Dax you ever saw.

934
01:51:52,652 --> 01:51:54,119
That's right.

935
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,154
No.

936
01:52:02,462 --> 01:52:03,986
I'm lying.

937
01:52:05,065 --> 01:52:07,556
I'm lying, Dax, I'm not telling you the truth.

938
01:52:11,938 --> 01:52:13,803
I can never have another baby.

939
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:15,735
I know.

940
01:52:17,277 --> 01:52:18,608
They told you?

941
01:52:22,382 --> 01:52:24,179
Why did you let me go on?

942
01:52:26,019 --> 01:52:27,748
You mustn't upset yourself.

943
01:52:28,989 --> 01:52:30,820
I've let you down, haven't I?

944
01:52:31,425 --> 01:52:33,484
No, of course not.

945
01:52:34,294 --> 01:52:35,625
Yes.

946
01:52:38,432 --> 01:52:41,162
You married me for my money, Dax,
I know that.

947
01:52:42,669 --> 01:52:46,230
Well, I'm rich.
I can give you everything you want.

948
01:52:48,241 --> 01:52:49,936
Everything except...

949
01:52:51,445 --> 01:52:53,345
The baby was so important.

950
01:52:54,848 --> 01:52:56,611
It would have kept us together.

951
01:53:00,187 --> 01:53:02,849
- I'm afraid now, Dax.
- No.

952
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:07,388
You mustn't be afraid. Nothing's changed.

953
01:53:09,162 --> 01:53:10,993
Nothing's different.

954
01:53:15,669 --> 01:53:17,364
Please, don't leave me.

955
01:53:22,976 --> 01:53:24,705
You must sleep now.

956
01:54:18,431 --> 01:54:22,333
A rich man with a wife he doesn't love,
who can't give him children.

957
01:54:22,669 --> 01:54:24,694
What happens to him, Fat Cat?

958
01:55:31,838 --> 01:55:33,066
El Lobo.

959
01:55:35,809 --> 01:55:38,539
- It's almost time.
- We're ready for them, El Lobo.

960
01:55:39,379 --> 01:55:40,573
Listen.

961
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:54,226
Two flight arrivals in one week. A record.

962
01:55:55,095 --> 01:55:57,996
Military aid.
These two are loaded with arms.

963
01:55:58,064 --> 01:55:59,759
Presidente is getting nervous.

964
01:56:14,147 --> 01:56:15,375
Ride!

965
02:00:35,308 --> 02:00:36,673
Excuse me.

966
02:00:36,876 --> 02:00:40,676
Mr. Xenos, I'd like to ask you
a few questions. I'm from Teen magazine.

967
02:00:41,381 --> 02:00:43,645
Well, we all have our cross to bear.

968
02:00:45,218 --> 02:00:48,153
Is it true that you've made love
to every woman in this room?

969
02:00:48,454 --> 02:00:49,751
Not yet.

970
02:00:52,058 --> 02:00:53,992
You've been married three times?

971
02:00:54,527 --> 02:00:57,052
And I've been co-respondent three times.

972
02:00:57,463 --> 02:01:00,694
Why have all your wives been
among the richest women in the world?

973
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:04,567
It was a deeply emotional experience.
Did I ever tell you about...

974
02:01:04,637 --> 02:01:05,831
Thank you.

975
02:01:07,073 --> 02:01:10,634
Did you take the key to my apartment
last night? I can't find it anywhere.

976
02:01:13,012 --> 02:01:15,879
- See you tonight.
- I'm sorry. I have to go home with Sue Ann.

977
02:01:16,316 --> 02:01:18,250
Sue Ann.

978
02:01:18,885 --> 02:01:20,978
I don't know why you always have to...

979
02:01:22,755 --> 02:01:26,156
I'm sorry, I forgot.
She's been your wife, too.

980
02:01:28,461 --> 02:01:29,951
How is Sue Ann?

981
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:33,627
- I haven't spoken to her yet.
- I haven't even seen her today.

982
02:01:33,933 --> 02:01:37,596
You can always tell an old married couple
by the way they avoid each other.

983
02:01:37,937 --> 02:01:38,995
Yes.

984
02:01:39,672 --> 02:01:41,299
Excuse me, Dax, will you?

985
02:01:46,379 --> 02:01:48,404
Is that my husband making his getaway?

986
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,380
How are you?

987
02:01:55,121 --> 02:01:56,349
You look marvelous.

988
02:01:57,256 --> 02:01:59,690
I haven't stopped eating for six months.

989
02:01:59,993 --> 02:02:02,587
- I'm sorry.
- That's the way it goes.

990
02:02:03,329 --> 02:02:05,661
Perhaps I shouldn't have married
either of you.

991
02:02:06,165 --> 02:02:08,759
- Would I have been happier then?
- No.

992
02:02:09,902 --> 02:02:11,028
Just fatter.

993
02:02:13,473 --> 02:02:15,031
Where did you go this year?

994
02:02:16,109 --> 02:02:17,770
Oh, around.

995
02:02:18,311 --> 02:02:21,678
- Morocco, Italy.
- Mexico?

996
02:02:22,415 --> 02:02:24,940
To divorce Kiki.
You're working faster than me.

997
02:02:26,786 --> 02:02:28,981
You don't mind me still wearing your ring?

998
02:02:31,424 --> 02:02:33,517
- Just one more.
- This way, please. Thank you.

999
02:02:33,593 --> 02:02:36,289
Please may I have your autograph,
Miss Leonardi?

1000
02:02:36,362 --> 02:02:38,830
I saw your Traviata at La Scala, Milan.

1001
02:02:38,965 --> 02:02:41,763
It was a deeply emotional experience.

1002
02:02:41,834 --> 02:02:44,029
- It was meant to be.
- Thank you.

1003
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:50,568
Since when have you been interested
in opera, Marcel?

1004
02:02:50,643 --> 02:02:52,873
Since I bought her recording company.

1005
02:02:58,484 --> 02:02:59,849
Excuse me.

1006
02:03:01,554 --> 02:03:03,749
Are the phones always busy
at Teen magazine?

1007
02:03:04,090 --> 02:03:06,456
Not if you dial BR-98700.

1008
02:03:08,861 --> 02:03:11,227
It's special from the Embassy.
Must be important.

1009
02:03:11,297 --> 02:03:14,266
- Embassy?
- The Corteguayan Embassy.

1010
02:03:15,802 --> 02:03:19,363
"El Presidente is pleased to invite you
to the unveiling of a memorial...

1011
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:21,031
"to Jaime Xenos.

1012
02:03:21,641 --> 02:03:23,575
"Patriot and freedom fighter. "

1013
02:03:27,814 --> 02:03:29,839
You will not refuse to go?

1014
02:03:30,583 --> 02:03:32,107
That's why I don't like it.

1015
02:03:33,352 --> 02:03:34,842
I can't refuse.

1016
02:04:46,959 --> 02:04:49,484
If only we were celebrating
a more happy occasion.

1017
02:04:50,530 --> 02:04:52,862
But your poor father
would have been delighted.

1018
02:04:53,232 --> 02:04:56,167
Señor, my poor father
would have been disgusted.

1019
02:04:57,336 --> 02:04:58,667
He was a man of peace.

1020
02:05:10,082 --> 02:05:11,515
I can't help myself.

1021
02:05:12,151 --> 02:05:14,619
So long as there are still bandits
in the hills...

1022
02:05:15,021 --> 02:05:17,421
and this one who calls himself El Lobo.

1023
02:05:37,376 --> 02:05:39,037
Do you think I'd want all this?

1024
02:05:39,612 --> 02:05:43,173
No, houses, Dax, hospitals, schools...

1025
02:05:43,249 --> 02:05:47,049
food, tractors, a five-year plan.

1026
02:05:49,455 --> 02:05:50,615
What do you think?

1027
02:05:50,823 --> 02:05:52,984
It will be very good to be a Corteguayan...

1028
02:05:54,026 --> 02:05:55,254
in five years' time.

1029
02:06:16,449 --> 02:06:18,883
You've been away from your country
too long, Dax.

1030
02:06:18,951 --> 02:06:20,782
I didn't sentence myself to exile.

1031
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:33,424
A new Corteguay. Modern, progressive.

1032
02:06:34,433 --> 02:06:35,900
But how to pay for it?

1033
02:06:36,669 --> 02:06:40,366
Where is the country
that will lend us the money? America?

1034
02:06:42,441 --> 02:06:44,773
That's where you got your money,
isn't it, Dax?

1035
02:06:46,112 --> 02:06:49,013
Three American wives.
Three American bank accounts.

1036
02:06:49,315 --> 02:06:51,715
Did you bring me here
to discuss my profession?

1037
02:06:52,685 --> 02:06:53,913
Sit down, Dax.

1038
02:06:55,021 --> 02:06:56,818
Over there, beside me.

1039
02:07:03,863 --> 02:07:05,091
That's better.

1040
02:07:07,566 --> 02:07:09,329
Now, Dax, I'll be frank with you.

1041
02:07:09,969 --> 02:07:12,267
- I need your help.
- Don't ask, señor.

1042
02:07:13,139 --> 02:07:16,233
In America, there is an organization
sponsored by the Government.

1043
02:07:16,309 --> 02:07:18,140
The Overseas Aid Committee.

1044
02:07:18,511 --> 02:07:19,773
Now, if Dax Xenos...

1045
02:07:19,879 --> 02:07:23,542
the famous Dax Xenos were to
approach a member of that committee...

1046
02:07:24,383 --> 02:07:27,045
- You have the wrong man.
- No, I have the right man.

1047
02:07:27,954 --> 02:07:31,117
The man who loves his country
and who will fight for his country.

1048
02:07:33,192 --> 02:07:34,454
Dax...

1049
02:07:35,261 --> 02:07:36,626
will you try?

1050
02:07:38,364 --> 02:07:40,093
Well, at least consider it.

1051
02:07:42,168 --> 02:07:44,659
We can talk again.
You don't have to decide at once.

1052
02:07:49,008 --> 02:07:50,339
All right.

1053
02:07:52,645 --> 02:07:54,135
I'll consider it.

1054
02:07:57,950 --> 02:08:01,511
You know, it seems so natural to have
you sitting there at my right hand.

1055
02:08:02,555 --> 02:08:04,147
I wish, well...

1056
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:06,023
One day, perhaps.

1057
02:08:06,592 --> 02:08:09,060
Champagne? We both need it.

1058
02:09:15,928 --> 02:09:19,329
First of all, when I heard
you were coming to Corteguay...

1059
02:09:20,499 --> 02:09:22,160
I felt I couldn't meet you.

1060
02:09:22,735 --> 02:09:24,168
Were you afraid?

1061
02:09:24,437 --> 02:09:26,302
Of you? No.

1062
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,632
You're safe here, anyway.

1063
02:09:30,543 --> 02:09:33,205
It had to be here. I'm not allowed to leave.

1064
02:09:34,113 --> 02:09:36,638
- You are a prisoner?
- Yes.

1065
02:09:37,516 --> 02:09:39,245
But I stay willingly now.

1066
02:09:40,152 --> 02:09:43,053
The nuns are kind. They're my friends.

1067
02:09:45,057 --> 02:09:47,184
Your father did this to you?

1068
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:50,020
Yes. But I have accepted it.

1069
02:09:51,097 --> 02:09:52,860
He kills his enemies.

1070
02:09:53,466 --> 02:09:56,833
Here I've learned to love them.
I'm quite happy.

1071
02:09:57,103 --> 02:09:58,570
But you're not free.

1072
02:09:59,004 --> 02:10:00,767
Not as you mean it, no.

1073
02:10:01,507 --> 02:10:04,601
- Because you are the President's daughter.
- Yes.

1074
02:10:07,346 --> 02:10:09,211
But for that, you and I...

1075
02:10:12,017 --> 02:10:13,609
Sometimes I hear of you.

1076
02:10:14,386 --> 02:10:17,048
Your wives, the parties...

1077
02:10:17,723 --> 02:10:20,055
in Paris, Rome, New York.

1078
02:10:21,227 --> 02:10:23,695
I imagine I'm there with you instead of here.

1079
02:10:27,066 --> 02:10:29,534
You and I, it was a long time ago.

1080
02:10:30,002 --> 02:10:31,526
For me it was yesterday.

1081
02:10:32,371 --> 02:10:34,134
Yesterday never happens again.

1082
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:35,964
No?

1083
02:10:37,343 --> 02:10:38,367
No.

1084
02:10:44,817 --> 02:10:46,375
Before you go...

1085
02:10:50,356 --> 02:10:52,449
There's something I must show you.

1086
02:10:59,165 --> 02:11:00,325
Hello.

1087
02:11:03,402 --> 02:11:04,562
Hello.

1088
02:11:12,711 --> 02:11:13,871
Look.

1089
02:11:14,914 --> 02:11:17,542
Butterfly. Butterflies.

1090
02:11:17,683 --> 02:11:19,014
Don't you know him?

1091
02:11:34,466 --> 02:11:37,196
- What's your name?
- Marcus Phillipe.

1092
02:11:37,703 --> 02:11:38,965
Phillipe?

1093
02:11:40,005 --> 02:11:41,199
Phillipe Xenos.

1094
02:11:42,508 --> 02:11:44,135
Do you have any kisses for me?

1095
02:11:44,210 --> 02:11:46,235
- Only one left.
- What, only one?

1096
02:11:54,420 --> 02:11:55,648
You went away.

1097
02:11:56,722 --> 02:11:59,350
Married. Became rich.

1098
02:11:59,758 --> 02:12:01,988
You got to go away for good?

1099
02:12:05,364 --> 02:12:06,888
Now I'm richer.

1100
02:12:11,370 --> 02:12:13,304
You'll take good care of him?

1101
02:12:13,973 --> 02:12:15,167
Always.

1102
02:12:17,309 --> 02:12:19,243
May I see you again when I come back?

1103
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:23,172
Will you come back?

1104
02:12:25,017 --> 02:12:28,509
Whatever I decide, I shall come back.

1105
02:12:30,956 --> 02:12:32,981
It's not easy for me, Dax.

1106
02:12:33,993 --> 02:12:35,756
- It hurts.
- I know.

1107
02:12:38,764 --> 02:12:40,026
But yes.

1108
02:12:40,766 --> 02:12:42,165
Whenever you like.

1109
02:12:46,472 --> 02:12:47,734
I hope.

1110
02:14:01,013 --> 02:14:04,847
Dax, you know I can't take this kind
of music. Why did you bring me?

1111
02:14:05,184 --> 02:14:07,118
I'm wondering that myself.

1112
02:14:13,425 --> 02:14:15,518
Who are all these strange people?

1113
02:14:15,594 --> 02:14:17,562
Well, you did ask me to invite them.

1114
02:14:17,629 --> 02:14:19,597
- Hello, Marcel.
- Hi.

1115
02:14:19,665 --> 02:14:21,098
I want to talk to you.

1116
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:24,494
Is there somewhere quiet? Private?

1117
02:14:24,570 --> 02:14:27,733
Private? Why yes. Come along.

1118
02:14:28,607 --> 02:14:30,097
Dax, what do I do?

1119
02:14:31,009 --> 02:14:33,534
Enjoy the music, darling. Enjoy the music.

1120
02:14:49,728 --> 02:14:51,696
Is she that loud in bed?

1121
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:58,260
Don't just stand there, Robert.
Get drinks for the guests.

1122
02:15:17,956 --> 02:15:19,548
What the hell's going on?

1123
02:15:42,815 --> 02:15:44,578
It's very funny.

1124
02:15:46,952 --> 02:15:48,647
At last we've got...

1125
02:15:49,288 --> 02:15:51,779
At last we've got something in common.

1126
02:15:52,825 --> 02:15:54,292
It's very funny.

1127
02:15:59,264 --> 02:16:00,356
Sue Ann?

1128
02:16:04,369 --> 02:16:05,427
Yes.

1129
02:16:16,982 --> 02:16:19,450
Somewhere quiet. Somewhere private.

1130
02:16:29,862 --> 02:16:32,729
Some of my best deals have been made
in these rooms.

1131
02:16:40,439 --> 02:16:43,306
- But who comes here? Your wife?
- April?

1132
02:16:44,443 --> 02:16:46,468
She doesn't even know the place exists.

1133
02:16:47,279 --> 02:16:48,837
Very few people do.

1134
02:16:52,885 --> 02:16:56,116
Well, what do you want to talk to me about?

1135
02:16:57,289 --> 02:16:58,415
Corteguay.

1136
02:16:59,191 --> 02:17:01,182
They need money. A loan.

1137
02:17:02,761 --> 02:17:04,092
When have they not?

1138
02:17:05,297 --> 02:17:06,594
How much do they want?

1139
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:09,089
About $60 million.

1140
02:17:09,635 --> 02:17:12,968
For tractors, medical equipment,
that sort of thing.

1141
02:17:13,505 --> 02:17:15,405
And you have to raise this loan?

1142
02:17:15,974 --> 02:17:17,305
I said I'll try.

1143
02:17:18,210 --> 02:17:19,472
Makes sense.

1144
02:17:19,745 --> 02:17:22,441
Have you any contact
with the Overseas Aid Committee?

1145
02:17:23,482 --> 02:17:25,780
Overseas Aid Committee? Let's see.

1146
02:17:27,085 --> 02:17:29,986
James Hadley. Vice Chairman.

1147
02:17:30,556 --> 02:17:32,023
He'd be your best bet.

1148
02:17:32,291 --> 02:17:34,054
- You know him?
- Yes.

1149
02:17:34,393 --> 02:17:35,655
He's an oil man.

1150
02:17:36,128 --> 02:17:38,392
I helped him with a merger last year.

1151
02:17:40,165 --> 02:17:42,793
- Can you fix a meeting?
- I could try.

1152
02:17:43,368 --> 02:17:44,960
That will be great.

1153
02:17:48,073 --> 02:17:49,836
Just like the old days.

1154
02:17:50,275 --> 02:17:52,004
With the same old 15%?

1155
02:17:53,545 --> 02:17:55,274
Not on a deal of this size.

1156
02:17:56,648 --> 02:17:58,912
-3%.
-7.5%.

1157
02:18:01,153 --> 02:18:02,245
5%.

1158
02:18:02,754 --> 02:18:05,314
Okay. I'm a philanthropist.

1159
02:18:05,891 --> 02:18:08,223
Well, Dax, my boy, I must say this...

1160
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:11,593
when Campion first told me
who was sponsoring this loan...

1161
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:13,363
I had my doubts.

1162
02:18:13,432 --> 02:18:17,266
After all, you do have, shall we say,
a certain reputation?

1163
02:18:17,469 --> 02:18:18,959
I know that, Mr. Hadley.

1164
02:18:20,472 --> 02:18:23,805
Now that I've talked with you,
I must admit. I'm impressed.

1165
02:18:24,076 --> 02:18:26,271
- Thank you.
- Most impressed.

1166
02:18:26,545 --> 02:18:28,308
Maybe just a little envious, too.

1167
02:18:33,452 --> 02:18:36,319
My wife.
Just back from a little shopping trip.

1168
02:18:45,097 --> 02:18:48,157
You'll be able to say hello,
then fly right back to the airport.

1169
02:18:48,233 --> 02:18:51,327
- I'm most grateful for your hospitality.
- Not at all.

1170
02:18:51,837 --> 02:18:54,806
About the loan, I'll put it before
my committee on Wednesday.

1171
02:18:54,873 --> 02:18:57,137
I've little doubt they'll see it my way.

1172
02:19:02,681 --> 02:19:05,844
It means a great deal to me, Mr. Hadley.
And to my country.

1173
02:19:05,917 --> 02:19:07,544
That I know, boy, that I know.

1174
02:19:08,086 --> 02:19:09,348
Hiya, sweetie.

1175
02:19:12,157 --> 02:19:15,058
- How was Frisco?
- Fine, just fine.

1176
02:19:21,066 --> 02:19:23,125
I have a little surprise for you, honey.

1177
02:19:23,201 --> 02:19:25,897
You're just in time to meet
my friend, Dax Xenos.

1178
02:19:27,739 --> 02:19:29,400
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Hadley.

1179
02:19:29,608 --> 02:19:31,542
Dax flew in from New York yesterday.

1180
02:19:32,077 --> 02:19:34,136
We're fixing up a little deal together.

1181
02:19:34,413 --> 02:19:36,506
And now you're going, Mr. Xenos?

1182
02:19:36,581 --> 02:19:39,015
I'm afraid so. I have to be back.

1183
02:19:39,918 --> 02:19:41,681
The White House on the line, sir.

1184
02:19:41,853 --> 02:19:43,946
Y'all excuse me, I'll be right back.

1185
02:19:44,389 --> 02:19:46,914
And, honey, don't you listen
to a word he says.

1186
02:19:47,225 --> 02:19:49,386
He tells the same thing to all the wives.

1187
02:19:51,596 --> 02:19:52,961
Thank you, Dax.

1188
02:19:53,865 --> 02:19:55,332
You haven't changed.

1189
02:19:55,567 --> 02:19:59,435
Heavier. Thicker around the middle.
The all-American matron.

1190
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:03,107
Still beautiful. Still Deborah.

1191
02:20:03,175 --> 02:20:04,972
You remember that much.

1192
02:20:05,043 --> 02:20:07,307
One forgets the bad things, not the good.

1193
02:20:07,546 --> 02:20:08,808
I'm glad.

1194
02:20:09,047 --> 02:20:11,106
Maybe we both found happiness in Rome.

1195
02:20:11,483 --> 02:20:14,941
But I was the lucky one.
I brought my happiness back here.

1196
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:16,848
And kept it.

1197
02:20:17,189 --> 02:20:19,089
- We shall meet again.
- Of course.

1198
02:20:19,624 --> 02:20:21,524
I hope you'll come and see us often.

1199
02:20:22,894 --> 02:20:25,556
Yes. Cigarette?

1200
02:20:34,005 --> 02:20:37,270
I promised myself, I'd never smoke again.

1201
02:20:40,746 --> 02:20:42,509
You two, getting along all right?

1202
02:20:43,515 --> 02:20:45,210
Dax, call me on Thursday.

1203
02:20:45,317 --> 02:20:48,286
- I might have a little word for you by then.
- I'll do that.

1204
02:20:48,353 --> 02:20:49,843
Goodbye, Mrs. Hadley.

1205
02:20:51,189 --> 02:20:54,090
- It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Xenos.
- And for me, too.

1206
02:20:59,631 --> 02:21:01,565
- Goodbye, Mr. Hadley.
- Have a good trip.

1207
02:21:01,633 --> 02:21:02,657
Thanks.

1208
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:44,602
I guess that's the last of the crates
from here, mister.

1209
02:21:44,676 --> 02:21:46,371
And the rest is being loaded in Miami?

1210
02:21:46,444 --> 02:21:47,877
That's right, on Thursday.

1211
02:21:47,946 --> 02:21:50,176
Tractors, cultivators, harvesters...

1212
02:21:50,248 --> 02:21:52,011
- grain and fertilizers.
- Fine.

1213
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:57,088
Well, are you satisfied?

1214
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:01,459
Now, you belong to Corteguay.

1215
02:22:02,527 --> 02:22:05,325
- Will you go back soon?
- I've done my job.

1216
02:22:06,164 --> 02:22:07,597
I'm not needed there.

1217
02:22:09,434 --> 02:22:12,164
I think there are some of those
who do need you.

1218
02:22:14,139 --> 02:22:16,937
Well, maybe. Maybe some day.

1219
02:22:30,322 --> 02:22:33,450
Miss Daley, do you have
any immediate plans after your divorce?

1220
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,685
Are there any plans
after your divorce, Miss Daley?

1221
02:22:43,635 --> 02:22:44,727
Hi.

1222
02:22:44,803 --> 02:22:46,430
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.

1223
02:22:49,474 --> 02:22:53,001
For two people about to get a divorce,
you look very close.

1224
02:22:53,511 --> 02:22:55,672
Well, I promised him a holiday afterwards.

1225
02:22:55,747 --> 02:22:57,840
- We are flying to Mexico tonight.
- Yes?

1226
02:22:57,916 --> 02:23:00,111
We might even fall in love all over again.

1227
02:23:00,218 --> 02:23:01,480
And we might not.

1228
02:23:02,587 --> 02:23:03,713
We can try.

1229
02:23:04,089 --> 02:23:08,048
Prince Nikovitch, will you come with me?
The hearing commences in a few moments.

1230
02:23:08,493 --> 02:23:10,290
I don't think you met my wife.

1231
02:23:11,029 --> 02:23:12,894
Darling, this is...

1232
02:23:16,801 --> 02:23:18,701
Don't stay. It's quite unimportant.

1233
02:23:20,105 --> 02:23:22,630
At the end of it
we shall still be the same people.

1234
02:23:31,516 --> 02:23:33,814
- Goodbye, Dax.
- Bye.

1235
02:23:48,633 --> 02:23:50,260
It's like a public lavatory.

1236
02:23:51,069 --> 02:23:54,004
I'm rather fond of it. I've been here before.

1237
02:23:57,475 --> 02:24:00,467
And I suppose I'll go on coming here
for the rest of my life.

1238
02:24:01,246 --> 02:24:03,771
No. You'll find somebody.

1239
02:24:07,519 --> 02:24:11,785
I'm the richest girl in the world.
I don't find people, they find me.

1240
02:24:12,958 --> 02:24:15,085
All I can afford to do is lose them.

1241
02:24:20,465 --> 02:24:22,023
All rise.

1242
02:24:32,277 --> 02:24:34,472
I thought I'd throw my own party here.

1243
02:24:34,546 --> 02:24:36,571
A kind of going-away party.

1244
02:24:36,648 --> 02:24:37,945
Just you and me.

1245
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:41,446
What's the matter with you, Robert?
Are you sick?

1246
02:24:42,554 --> 02:24:45,455
- No.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

1247
02:24:46,491 --> 02:24:48,391
I've been thinking.

1248
02:24:48,626 --> 02:24:52,187
How much you and Sergei and Marcel
have all changed.

1249
02:24:52,731 --> 02:24:55,564
How different you all are
from those early days in Rome.

1250
02:24:56,668 --> 02:24:58,067
How little I've changed.

1251
02:24:59,304 --> 02:25:03,798
I'm still the same schoolboy
who loses all his fights.

1252
02:25:04,109 --> 02:25:06,475
Is that all you brought me out here
to tell me?

1253
02:25:06,711 --> 02:25:07,769
No.

1254
02:25:09,414 --> 02:25:11,780
It's the ship. Your ship.

1255
02:25:12,517 --> 02:25:14,712
It didn't dock in Miami on Thursday.

1256
02:25:14,953 --> 02:25:17,751
Didn't dock? Why, what happened?

1257
02:25:18,123 --> 02:25:20,853
- It docked in Panama on Sunday.
- Panama?

1258
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:24,890
- It had no business in Panama.
- Yes, it had.

1259
02:25:25,663 --> 02:25:29,759
It took on a cargo of arms, tanks,
artillery, and ammunition.

1260
02:25:30,268 --> 02:25:31,735
Who did this?

1261
02:25:32,404 --> 02:25:34,872
Marcel. Marcel and Rojo.

1262
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:36,232
When?

1263
02:25:36,574 --> 02:25:38,906
Right after you had agreed to raise the loan.

1264
02:25:38,977 --> 02:25:41,275
Marcel flew to Corteguay and fixed the deal.

1265
02:25:41,346 --> 02:25:42,779
How long have you known?

1266
02:25:44,049 --> 02:25:46,415
- I've known.
- And you didn't warn me?

1267
02:25:47,552 --> 02:25:50,578
I couldn't. Marcel made sure I couldn't.

1268
02:25:52,524 --> 02:25:55,687
You see, I've never had
very much courage, Dax.

1269
02:25:56,361 --> 02:25:59,455
And Marcel introduced me to something
which gave me courage.

1270
02:26:00,031 --> 02:26:01,794
Oh, you bloody fool.

1271
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,127
Worry about your ship, not about me.

1272
02:26:04,469 --> 02:26:07,404
I'm a dead man.
As soon as Marcel knows, anyway.

1273
02:26:07,806 --> 02:26:09,569
I'll take care of Marcel.

1274
02:26:10,742 --> 02:26:12,209
What are you going to do?

1275
02:26:12,544 --> 02:26:13,977
You'd better hurry, Dax.

1276
02:26:14,779 --> 02:26:16,269
There's not very much time.

1277
02:26:30,595 --> 02:26:32,790
I never can fix the last button, you know.

1278
02:26:34,199 --> 02:26:35,427
You were saying?

1279
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:37,629
The poor always suffer the most.

1280
02:26:38,369 --> 02:26:40,667
They have the least
to defend themselves with.

1281
02:26:41,039 --> 02:26:43,234
- This damn tie.
- May I help?

1282
02:26:43,308 --> 02:26:44,502
Please.

1283
02:26:44,876 --> 02:26:46,867
You are an intelligent man, Marcel.

1284
02:26:47,212 --> 02:26:50,409
Tell us, how can El Rojo
defeat the guerillas?

1285
02:26:50,949 --> 02:26:52,780
By killing them, I suppose.

1286
02:26:54,052 --> 02:26:56,145
And how are those people killed, Marcel?

1287
02:26:58,189 --> 02:26:59,656
With guns, of course.

1288
02:27:00,258 --> 02:27:02,419
And who sells those guns to Rojo?

1289
02:27:04,596 --> 02:27:06,587
Who gets paid by Rojo?

1290
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:10,964
Who made the double-cross to Mr. Xenos?

1291
02:27:16,407 --> 02:27:18,238
You'll talk to us, Marcel.

1292
02:27:19,544 --> 02:27:20,704
Now.

1293
02:27:35,293 --> 02:27:38,160
You could never resist a deal, Marcel,
could you?

1294
02:27:40,665 --> 02:27:41,757
Come on.

1295
02:27:45,170 --> 02:27:46,194
No!

1296
02:27:46,871 --> 02:27:49,669
No, Dax. Please.

1297
02:27:50,408 --> 02:27:52,433
Dax. No.

1298
02:27:53,011 --> 02:27:54,638
- Let me go.
- Take him.

1299
02:27:57,949 --> 02:27:59,143
Dax, please.

1300
02:27:59,217 --> 02:28:01,947
Just one more deal now, Marcel. With me.

1301
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:03,881
No.

1302
02:28:14,566 --> 02:28:18,093
What do you want? Dax, I know nothing.

1303
02:28:30,949 --> 02:28:31,938
Now.

1304
02:28:33,184 --> 02:28:35,516
Where is that shipment of arms
to dock, Marcel?

1305
02:28:35,954 --> 02:28:37,114
I don't know.

1306
02:28:37,589 --> 02:28:39,181
Honestly, I don't.

1307
02:28:47,298 --> 02:28:49,789
The boat, where will it stop?

1308
02:28:50,535 --> 02:28:52,662
Only Rojo knows that, I swear.

1309
02:28:58,076 --> 02:28:59,236
Where?

1310
02:29:00,878 --> 02:29:03,176
Puerto San Pablo on the north coast.

1311
02:29:03,815 --> 02:29:05,282
When will it dock?

1312
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:07,215
I don't know. It's not certain.

1313
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:14,550
Nobody can hear you, Marcel. When?

1314
02:29:20,798 --> 02:29:21,992
No.

1315
02:29:24,836 --> 02:29:25,928
When?

1316
02:29:27,171 --> 02:29:31,073
Tomorrow night. Then by train to Curatu.

1317
02:29:35,046 --> 02:29:36,070
No.

1318
02:29:43,087 --> 02:29:45,351
So uncivilized, isn't it?

1319
02:29:49,827 --> 02:29:52,694
Dax! Please!

1320
02:29:53,097 --> 02:29:54,826
You can't leave me like this.

1321
02:29:55,133 --> 02:29:56,964
No. Please.

1322
02:29:57,235 --> 02:29:58,998
Come back, Dax!

1323
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:01,670
Fat Cat, help me!

1324
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:04,768
Help me, I'll give you anything! Anything.

1325
02:30:05,410 --> 02:30:08,243
Don't leave me like this. Don't make me...

1326
02:30:55,827 --> 02:30:57,385
I begin to believe you.

1327
02:30:58,329 --> 02:30:59,728
Why should I lie?

1328
02:31:00,598 --> 02:31:03,590
El Condor once trusted you.
If this is another trap...

1329
02:31:04,202 --> 02:31:05,430
There is no trap.

1330
02:33:26,978 --> 02:33:28,570
Viva El Lobo.

1331
02:33:41,859 --> 02:33:43,156
Can I help you?

1332
02:33:44,629 --> 02:33:45,653
No.

1333
02:33:46,364 --> 02:33:47,661
What is it?

1334
02:33:47,732 --> 02:33:49,256
Don't you recognize me?

1335
02:33:51,536 --> 02:33:53,163
The boy of El Condor.

1336
02:33:54,605 --> 02:33:56,573
- You are El Condor's son?
- Yes.

1337
02:33:57,708 --> 02:33:59,107
I don't forget you.

1338
02:33:59,810 --> 02:34:01,334
I shall never forget you.

1339
02:34:01,779 --> 02:34:03,178
You need help.

1340
02:34:04,916 --> 02:34:07,248
Not from you. I'd rather die.

1341
02:34:12,123 --> 02:34:13,488
It's a great day.

1342
02:34:14,292 --> 02:34:15,691
Rojo is finished.

1343
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:17,689
Tomorrow, we attack the capital.

1344
02:34:18,262 --> 02:34:19,854
Have you lost many men?

1345
02:34:19,931 --> 02:34:21,398
Yes, but they lost more.

1346
02:34:23,734 --> 02:34:26,202
I know what you are thinking,
but you are wrong.

1347
02:34:26,804 --> 02:34:29,204
My men aren't a rabble.
They obey my orders.

1348
02:34:29,407 --> 02:34:32,774
There will be no massacres, no raping
and pillaging in this revolution.

1349
02:34:32,843 --> 02:34:34,970
We'll fight to bring life to Corteguay...

1350
02:34:35,046 --> 02:34:36,172
not death.

1351
02:34:39,617 --> 02:34:40,982
Get on the train.

1352
02:34:49,427 --> 02:34:50,758
On to Curatu!

1353
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,365
Rebel tanks.

1354
02:36:38,502 --> 02:36:39,594
Fire!

1355
02:36:44,442 --> 02:36:45,534
Fire!

1356
02:37:56,046 --> 02:37:57,274
Machine guns!

1357
02:37:57,948 --> 02:37:59,040
Fire!

1358
02:38:06,891 --> 02:38:08,381
Charge!

1359
02:38:30,948 --> 02:38:33,439
The situation is looking very satisfactory.

1360
02:38:33,784 --> 02:38:34,842
Sir.

1361
02:38:40,291 --> 02:38:41,519
General!

1362
02:38:44,195 --> 02:38:46,686
The rebels are in the suburbs.
What do you say to that?

1363
02:38:46,764 --> 02:38:49,824
I say that they will be held
and thrown back, Señor Presidente.

1364
02:38:50,734 --> 02:38:52,793
And I say the rebels are in the suburbs.

1365
02:39:30,474 --> 02:39:31,463
Amparo.

1366
02:40:13,684 --> 02:40:15,481
- What happened?
- Gone.

1367
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:17,551
Where have they gone?

1368
02:40:17,621 --> 02:40:21,148
I have six children,
they are always hungry, señor.

1369
02:40:22,192 --> 02:40:23,352
Where?

1370
02:40:23,661 --> 02:40:26,459
Curatu, to the Convent of Santa Maria.

1371
02:40:26,664 --> 02:40:28,154
I know where it is, come on.

1372
02:41:08,472 --> 02:41:09,530
That door.

1373
02:42:17,374 --> 02:42:18,568
Amparo.

1374
02:42:22,012 --> 02:42:23,172
Dax.

1375
02:42:30,788 --> 02:42:33,154
- Phillipe?
- Yes.

1376
02:42:43,367 --> 02:42:47,064
Pillage. Rape. Destruction. Death.

1377
02:42:48,939 --> 02:42:50,463
It's always the same.

1378
02:42:51,975 --> 02:42:53,567
Not only in Corteguay.

1379
02:42:55,512 --> 02:42:56,843
Other countries learn.

1380
02:42:57,247 --> 02:42:58,874
Slowly, but they do learn.

1381
02:42:59,283 --> 02:43:01,547
- But we have nothing.
- No.

1382
02:43:02,786 --> 02:43:04,276
They can have more.

1383
02:43:05,689 --> 02:43:07,987
And you can have more, too.
You and Phillipe.

1384
02:43:09,293 --> 02:43:11,921
We'll go to Rome. When this is over...

1385
02:43:12,863 --> 02:43:16,526
I'll go to the Palace,
see El Lobo and arrange it.

1386
02:43:18,302 --> 02:43:19,963
And what about my father?

1387
02:43:21,672 --> 02:43:23,071
I'll do what I can.

1388
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:31,474
Rome.

1389
02:43:32,883 --> 02:43:34,407
Is it possible?

1390
02:43:36,854 --> 02:43:38,913
El Lobo can't refuse to let us go.

1391
02:43:40,524 --> 02:43:42,219
He owes me more than that.

1392
02:43:42,292 --> 02:43:44,453
And in Rome, what then?

1393
02:43:45,896 --> 02:43:47,386
Will you leave me?

1394
02:43:49,032 --> 02:43:51,557
Don't save me just to leave me, Dax.

1395
02:43:54,771 --> 02:43:56,033
No, Amparo.

1396
02:44:01,578 --> 02:44:04,513
You and I and Phillipe...

1397
02:44:08,285 --> 02:44:10,185
we are all that's left of...

1398
02:44:13,056 --> 02:44:14,250
You're my family.

1399
02:44:17,928 --> 02:44:19,395
Oh, God.

1400
02:44:20,831 --> 02:44:22,389
You are my future.

1401
02:44:25,602 --> 02:44:26,796
Is that enough?

1402
02:44:28,839 --> 02:44:30,272
Yes.

1403
02:44:31,575 --> 02:44:33,304
Yes, it's enough.

1404
02:44:40,184 --> 02:44:41,845
I must go to the Palace.

1405
02:44:42,619 --> 02:44:45,315
When it's safe, I'll send Fat Cat to fetch you.

1406
02:45:37,207 --> 02:45:39,175
The Government is in full command.

1407
02:45:39,977 --> 02:45:41,774
The revolution will be crushed...

1408
02:45:42,079 --> 02:45:44,104
for the people do not want the revolution.

1409
02:45:58,729 --> 02:46:01,721
Campesinos, farmers, workers...

1410
02:46:02,366 --> 02:46:04,732
this is El Lobo, the voice of the revolution.

1411
02:46:05,235 --> 02:46:07,760
Put down your arms. The fighting is over.

1412
02:46:07,838 --> 02:46:09,806
Corteguay belongs to the revolution.

1413
02:46:10,374 --> 02:46:12,934
Corteguay will always belong
to the revolution.

1414
02:46:50,881 --> 02:46:52,041
Aim!

1415
02:47:00,657 --> 02:47:01,715
Fire!

1416
02:47:06,897 --> 02:47:07,989
Fire!

1417
02:47:51,908 --> 02:47:55,400
Where is Rojo? Where is Diablo?

1418
02:47:55,645 --> 02:47:57,510
Where is Rojo?

1419
02:48:17,901 --> 02:48:19,630
You hear how they roar for him?

1420
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:22,304
The tyrant is more popular than ever.

1421
02:48:24,608 --> 02:48:26,041
What will you do to him?

1422
02:48:27,778 --> 02:48:29,837
The voice of the people must be obeyed.

1423
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:32,675
They want him, they must have him.

1424
02:48:33,150 --> 02:48:34,777
They'll tear him to pieces.

1425
02:48:36,987 --> 02:48:39,922
You promised justice. At least a quick death.

1426
02:48:40,791 --> 02:48:43,021
He will get the same justice he gave.

1427
02:48:43,093 --> 02:48:44,390
I am a soldier.

1428
02:48:45,395 --> 02:48:46,692
Gen. Rojo.

1429
02:48:46,763 --> 02:48:48,731
There's no more Rojo in Corteguay.

1430
02:48:48,799 --> 02:48:50,289
I demand a soldier's death.

1431
02:48:55,906 --> 02:48:57,874
I taught you to kill. Remember?

1432
02:48:59,242 --> 02:49:01,005
I steadied the gun in your hands.

1433
02:49:02,179 --> 02:49:03,669
Kill me. Now.

1434
02:49:06,716 --> 02:49:07,774
No.

1435
02:49:09,453 --> 02:49:10,681
I can't.

1436
02:49:11,188 --> 02:49:14,089
Dax, I loved you.

1437
02:49:19,896 --> 02:49:22,694
Take him. Take him out of my Palace.

1438
02:49:25,402 --> 02:49:27,427
Dax, your father! Your father!

1439
02:49:30,941 --> 02:49:32,169
I killed him.

1440
02:49:35,245 --> 02:49:37,145
He was killed on my orders, Dax.

1441
02:49:45,388 --> 02:49:46,719
I murdered him.

1442
02:50:36,039 --> 02:50:38,337
The plane is waiting for you at the airfield.

1443
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:40,169
For us.

1444
02:50:41,244 --> 02:50:43,269
- Dax, what is it?
- I have to stay.

1445
02:50:44,581 --> 02:50:47,516
Not for long,
but I can't come with you now.

1446
02:50:47,951 --> 02:50:50,715
But why? The revolution's over.

1447
02:50:51,421 --> 02:50:53,651
The fighting's over. That's all.

1448
02:50:54,357 --> 02:50:55,619
What else is there?

1449
02:50:55,692 --> 02:50:58,320
- You can't do any more to help, Dax.
- Help?

1450
02:50:59,396 --> 02:51:02,229
Who have I helped? Corteguay?

1451
02:51:03,633 --> 02:51:06,101
To kill one tyrant
and put another in his place.

1452
02:51:08,705 --> 02:51:10,730
You can't change that now.

1453
02:51:12,909 --> 02:51:14,137
I can try.

1454
02:51:15,579 --> 02:51:16,978
El Lobo respects me.

1455
02:51:17,147 --> 02:51:19,274
If I'm here, I can control him.

1456
02:51:19,449 --> 02:51:22,179
- In a few weeks, I...
- No, Dax, you promised.

1457
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:26,486
Amparo, for my sake and Phillipe.

1458
02:51:28,158 --> 02:51:29,557
You must go.

1459
02:51:39,402 --> 02:51:40,960
You'll be safe in Rome.

1460
02:51:42,739 --> 02:51:44,229
Fat Cat will look after you.

1461
02:51:44,407 --> 02:51:46,272
I'll join you as soon as possible.

1462
02:51:49,613 --> 02:51:50,841
Fat Cat.

1463
02:51:53,850 --> 02:51:55,977
I stay with you, always.

1464
02:51:56,052 --> 02:51:59,180
Not this time.
They need you more than I do.

1465
02:51:59,723 --> 02:52:02,021
My father wanted me to care as he did.

1466
02:52:02,459 --> 02:52:04,757
Well, now at last I do care.

1467
02:52:09,799 --> 02:52:13,166
I'm asking you, my friend, to help me.

1468
02:52:19,809 --> 02:52:21,299
You have changed.

1469
02:52:22,712 --> 02:52:24,543
Now you are like your father.

1470
02:52:38,628 --> 02:52:40,391
Promise you will come soon.

1471
02:52:41,498 --> 02:52:42,829
I promise.

1472
02:52:43,833 --> 02:52:45,425
I found you yesterday.

1473
02:52:46,136 --> 02:52:48,434
- Today...
- Don't think of today, Amparo.

1474
02:52:49,506 --> 02:52:50,905
Only tomorrow.

1475
02:52:57,781 --> 02:52:59,248
Goodbye, Dax.

1476
02:53:00,083 --> 02:53:01,607
Until tomorrow.

1477
02:53:18,368 --> 02:53:20,029
Take care of my son.

1478
02:53:20,136 --> 02:53:21,694
As if he were you.
