00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,580
‘Seolgyeong’<i>is a weaponized<i>
<i>‘talisman’<i>that seals vile spirits<i></i></i></i></i></i>

2
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:00,916
with Buddhist sutras and patterns.<i></i>

3
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:38,748
Dong-woo!

4
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,292
Grandpa…

5
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:48,580
I’m here, don’t worry.

6
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,748
<i>You’ve reached your destination.</i>

7
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:19,124
<i>This is a no parking zone,</i>
<i>don’t park here.</i>

8
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,456
How did you wake up on cue?
Were you pretending to be asleep?

9
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:24,708
Man…

10
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,248
I heard the GPS say we’re here.

11
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,292
In-bae, I mean, Apprentice Kang.

12
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,748
It’s our first gig in a while,
let’s do it right.

13
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,000
Stop with that Apprentice Kang,

14
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
a technician should
stick to technical things!

15
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:47,208
I know all about
your technical prowess,

16
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:51,164
startups like us
have to wear many hats.

17
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,664
I’m not asking for the impossible,

18
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,872
Apprentice Kang is capable
of multi-tasking,

19
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:59,708
so, you’re the only one
whom I fully trust.

20
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,416
Multi-tasking?

21
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:03,456
What’s wrong with the madame here?

22
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:06,792
She said her daughter’s
possessed or something.

23
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,332
A middle schooler.

24
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,664
Are you allowed to park there?

25
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:11,916
They can’t tow that.

26
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:15,748
Holy cow…

27
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,916
I got a half basement room
with 3-year savings,

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I’ll have to work 250 years
to live in a place like this.

29
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:27,792
I’d be so old in 250 years.

30
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,500
That again?

31
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:37,208
Why bother ringing that?
it never rings…

32
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,792
In-bae, be quiet.

33
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:46,624
Nothing much here.

34
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,040
No need to get nervous,
stick to what we do.

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,040
Stupid concept and freaks,
you live tough lives.

36
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,500
It looked so fake on YouTube.

37
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,208
You must be the middle schooler.

38
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:57,164
Hey!

39
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,540
What are you doing there?!

40
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,208
Where are your manners?

41
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,208
Allow me to apologize.

42
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,580
She’s usually…

43
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:07,792
She’s usually not like that,
but she changed suddenly.

44
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,416
It’s as if she’s possessed.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,332
Do you feel anything
seeing her in person?

46
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:13,080
Shhh!

47
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,708
The child is not the problem.

48
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:25,000
Stench is all over the house.

49
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,664
Stench of rotting corpse…

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,580
is piercing my nose right now...

51
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,164
Morons, what a load of shit.

52
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,832
It’s coming from inside too,

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
let’s all go inside.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,956
Apprentice Kang, make preparations.

55
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,580
Never cross…

56
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:11,540
this straw rope, please.

57
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,832
Mister, this is all bullshit, right?

58
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,456
You’re embarrassing us!

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,208
I’m the one embarrassed!

60
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,292
Shit!

61
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:29,624
Did you know what this was
before putting it here?

62
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:38,456
I was told it's a totem from a noble
house protecting its boundaries...

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,708
It did belong to a noble family,
but not home…

64
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,664
it’s for a tomb.

65
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,540
As in grave?

66
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:54,792
Yes.

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,792
This is called a tomb totem.

68
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,456
A totem that protects the deceased.

69
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,500
This totem is

70
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:08,208
creating the stench,

71
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,080
and turning this home
into a grave!

72
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,000
That’s why you’re restless in bed!

73
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:13,748
That’s right…

74
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,624
When you lie down, your legs itch
as if bugs crawl all over them,

75
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:18,456
pit of the stomach feels stuffy,

76
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,040
and even when you fall asleep,

77
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,000
you wake up from bad dreams!

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,292
- Yes!
- Yeah!

79
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:25,956
The business is booming,
but income is down!

80
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,000
- Yes, yes…
- Moron!

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,832
Hiking and golfing all weekend,
but he’s always sick…

82
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:30,456
- That’s right!
- So right!

83
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,456
And the daughter suddenly
became bitchy,

84
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,124
not only that, her grades
are dropping, am I right?!

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,832
What are you staring at?

86
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,000
You’re right, so right,
how could you be so accurate?

87
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,080
This is all because of the totem!

88
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,872
What should I do, doctor?

89
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,164
What else?!

90
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,580
We must exorcise
the spirit from the totem.

91
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:59,040
Raise the god of the five directions!

92
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:03,372
Drive god of the South and the East,
help us get rid of this vile spirit!

93
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,664
Put your phone down!

94
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:05,748
Go away!

95
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,624
Vile spirit, go away!

96
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,624
Holy shit…

97
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,416
Did you see that?
He stabbed it…

98
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:13,500
He stabbed it…

99
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,580
Phone down!

100
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,372
No way.

101
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,292
Oh gosh…

102
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
Enough!

103
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,916
It was haunted by a rude spirit!

104
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,372
What the hell?!

105
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:53,624
Gosh!

106
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,872
You’ll be fine behind the rope.

107
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,832
The spirit shall return
to the afterlife!

108
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:21,832
It has stopped.

109
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,792
Return at once!

110
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:27,708
Return!

111
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,124
- Did it return?
- Eh?

112
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:35,040
Divine wifi, divine wifi,
wifi, wifi…

113
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,248
- What is it?
- Come on!

114
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:38,332
What happened…

115
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:42,164
Get down!

116
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:55,124
Do you see it?

117
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:57,624
Pardon?

118
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,416
What should have gone that way,

119
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,540
came this way instead.

120
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,540
These are what pulled the totem.

121
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,124
You have a very strange taste.

122
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:12,208
That’s why you’re intrigued by these.

123
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:17,040
From here on, if something
intrigues you, avoid it at all costs.

124
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,456
If you get the urge to buy,
let your wife decide.

125
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,872
Yes, I’ll take that to my heart.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,124
Respect.

127
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,292
Very well.

128
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,124
Because of recent events,

129
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,708
your daughter’s feelings were hurt,

130
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:36,832
let her take it easy for 2 weeks.

131
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,664
Don’t let her go to school
or other tutors,

132
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,372
and just let her do
whatever she wants.

133
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:46,792
I’m so sorry for not realizing your
greatness and calling you fakers!

134
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,332
Oh my…

135
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:59,248
Anyway, these should be cleaned up...

136
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:08,040
Please get rid of them
as you see fit.

137
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:09,708
Apprentice Kang?

138
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,208
Sure.

139
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:14,164
Buddha, are you okay?

140
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,832
It’s not an easy task,
but I’ll do it at no charge.

141
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:30,248
Only peace will remain
in this household.

142
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:45,540
DR. CHEON AND THE LOST TALISMAN<i></i>

143
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:50,872
In-bae, parking…

144
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:53,080
How could they tow that?

145
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:57,500
And go easy with explosives,
that’s all money!

146
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,040
How could a technician not
control a rock properly?

147
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Are you possessed by
the totem spirit?

148
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,792
I gotta control the music,
explosion, theatrics,

149
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,624
and tug all heartstrings
as Apprentice Kang…

150
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,580
I can’t do this alone,
hire someone!

151
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,708
In-bae, I really was going to
hire someone this time,

152
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:16,916
but I’m too nervous to do it,
look at what happened today,

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm too busy cleaning up your mess,
how can I handle another newbie.

154
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,040
You should've gone with
an easy target.

155
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,916
There were so many light things,
why pick this heavy rock?

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,332
You see?

157
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,580
You’re not ready for an assistant.

158
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,624
What’s this?

159
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:36,040
This is the kid’s Instagram,
a birthday party a month ago.

160
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:37,500
Good, next question,

161
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,372
how is that different
from today’s?

162
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,164
Did she cut her hair?

163
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,416
The totem’s not there!

164
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,164
<i>The color of the dirt on it is different,</i>

165
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:54,164
<i>and moss is on the side</i>
<i>facing the sun.</i>

166
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:57,080
<i>It hasn’t been a few weeks</i>
<i>since it was bought.</i>

167
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:01,872
<i>Then why keep a new totem</i>
<i>out of view?</i>

168
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:05,664
<i>Because it was an eye sore</i>
<i>for the madame.</i>

169
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:09,416
<i>She must’ve hated seeing</i>
<i>her husband’s things.</i>

170
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:17,372
So, you used the totem
as an excuse to make her happy,

171
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,708
and keep her at bay

172
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:22,332
from that weird looking husband
and bratty kid?

173
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,372
Right.

174
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:30,664
According to DSM-4 of
American Psychiatric Association,

175
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,248
Koreans suffer from 2 disorders
stemmed from culture-bound syndrome.

176
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,456
One is ‘anger syndrome’
and the other…

177
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,124
Hey, be careful!

178
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,416
Buddha, sorry.

179
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,208
The other must be
ancestral spirit possession, S-H-I-N…

180
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:42,292
Very good.

181
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:44,164
Anyway, you're saying that
we don't deal with ghosts,

182
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:45,456
but a person's mind, soul, etc...

183
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, yes, yes.

184
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:50,708
The ghosts we tackle are in...

185
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,540
Gosh.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,248
Our divine toad.

187
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:09,080
Hold on tight.

188
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,956
Shit, goddamn rock…

189
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,208
Very nice.

190
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Jeez.

191
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:41,292
I know the market price for gold,
don't even try.

192
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:45,500
Melting and molding it
will cost me quite a bit.

193
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,372
You can put it there
sell it as is.

194
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,664
You’ll go to hell
if you scam me too often.

195
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:55,040
You’ll go to prison before hell
when you sell things with seals.

196
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:58,792
Is that all for today?

197
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,580
This damn rock is too heavy!

198
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,080
You guys raid tombs now?

199
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:07,792
Was this really guarding a grave?

200
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,372
I saw tons of these at
restaurant gardens.

201
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,208
Dr. Cheon, how long will you
live like this?

202
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,500
Why do you continue
scamming people?!

203
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,000
I told you, it’s psych treatment,
not scams.

204
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,624
Do you honestly think, if I tell

205
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:23,372
my clients that there aren’t
any ghosts, would they just nod?

206
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,164
They’ll curse at me,
and run to the next shaman.

207
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:31,748
I’m preventing them from losing
tens of thousands of dollars.

208
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,372
How did the grandson
of a chief shaman...

209
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:45,164
Always with that chief shaman crap…

210
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,832
That’s ancient history,

211
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,500
why do you still bring that up?

212
00:14:56,124 --> 00:15:00,164
Why are you so desperate
to bring that up again?

213
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,124
What happened to the gold price?

214
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:15,000
Reminder, reminder,
they sure can sniff money.

215
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,080
So many reminders…

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Doc, I got gifts for you.

217
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,792
Are we good?

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,248
Are you the boss?

219
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:32,080
Stop worrying and focus on editing.

220
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:33,748
Hurry up!

221
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:38,080
There’s my reminder.

222
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,416
Medical License<i></i>

223
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,956
Pyeongchang-dong<i></i>

224
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,832
Madame Song<i></i>

225
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:30,664
Yeah, mom.

226
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:32,916
The deaconess showed you what?

227
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:38,540
Heavenly Cheon TV’s apprentice?
I said that bastard’s not me, prick!

228
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,332
I’m not cursing at the deaconess.

229
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:45,748
Don’t you know where
your son works at?

230
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,580
I work at a very specialized
high-tech psychiatry.

231
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,664
<i>Why turn me into a cult fanatic</i>
<i>when I have a perfectly ordinary job?</i>

232
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:57,248
<i>And why is a church deaconess</i>
<i>watching Heavenly Cheon TV?</i>

233
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,372
Mom, I may have a date
on Christmas, I gotta go.

234
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,832
What a load of crap…

235
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,332
Apprentice Kang?

236
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:21,708
Yes, I’m Apprentice Kang.

237
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,040
You can just call me In-bae.

238
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:28,124
Kang In-bae.

239
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,000
Pardon me.

240
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:35,580
We’re fully booked for the year.

241
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:37,416
Sorry about that.

242
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,164
What a load of crap…

243
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:43,956
One sec, I’m the VP here,
I’ll talk to him.

244
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,124
Doc, we had bookings?

245
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,624
Get it together, Apprentice Kang.

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,624
I’m very much together,
thanks to her.

247
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,208
This is definitely a pro bono case.

248
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,292
Our company isn’t UNICEF.

249
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,664
Didn’t you see her diamond ring?
It’s gotta be at least 2 carats.

250
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,748
If it’s on the left hand,
is it a wedding ring?

251
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,708
That’s the right hand.

252
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:07,208
I told you not to miss details.

253
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,292
She wore it out of anxiety.

254
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,248
<i>It’s an old design and wrong size.</i>

255
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,748
Handed down from her mother,
she’s wearing it like a talisman.

256
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,040
In-bae.

257
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,916
I told you we shouldn’t
take on lonely and desperate…

258
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:20,748
You see?

259
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:21,872
Stop!

260
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,164
I heard you charge
$10,000 per job.

261
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:27,248
It’s not the money
that I chase, pursuing…

262
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:31,416
$50,000 for coming with me now,

263
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:33,208
another $50,000 after the job.

264
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:34,248
Miss!

265
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,208
Hm?

266
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:38,708
Where is the job?

267
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,872
Hm?

268
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,372
Gwechun, Chungcheong province.

269
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,540
Gwechun County<i></i>

270
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,580
Do you want to flirt with her
or get rejected?

271
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:07,832
Yoo-kyung is the first person
to offer her hand to me.

272
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:11,792
Yoo-kyung is also the first person
to unload

273
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,292
that much money on me.

274
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:17,792
In her 20s, dad’s car,
mom’s ring,

275
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,956
no parents in sight.

276
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:22,748
<i>Resides in the country.</i>

277
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,708
Looks like a student,
maybe taking some time off?

278
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:36,248
No, no, look…

279
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,124
Dozing off behind the wheel?

280
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:47,832
I should've driven that car for her…

281
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:57,500
Fog?

282
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,292
I got the thumbnail title,
‘The Lady in the Fog’.

283
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,416
Great concept,
I got a good feeling.

284
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,124
Beautiful eyes,
I sense a ton of views.

285
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,124
Good.

286
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,124
Is everyone moving out?

287
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:21,708
Is he a shaman?

288
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,832
Funerals everywhere,
this feels weird...

289
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,540
What happened here?

290
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:59,124
Who is that?

291
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,456
They came to give us
a quote for the move.

292
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:15,832
You look terrible,
make sure to eat.

293
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,500
Always call me
if you need my help.

294
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:21,664
Thank you for your concern.

295
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,372
Pardon me for intruding.

296
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,040
Can’t leave because of your sister?

297
00:22:22,164 --> 00:22:23,500
What about her sister?

298
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,372
There’s nothing here.

299
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,208
It’s okay, please open.

300
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,624
Yoo-kyung…

301
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:57,372
Why are you doing this to me?

302
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:09,708
Doc, what’s going on here,
can we chat outside?

303
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,248
I’m getting a call…

304
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:27,372
Jeez!

305
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,416
What’s wrong with this place?

306
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:35,792
Doc, we have to get out,
let’s just bail.

307
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,208
How do you abandon the first person
who reached out to you?

308
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:43,624
There were others actually, and
I definitely didn’t take her hand!

309
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,832
In-bae, a child is tied up,

310
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:49,956
how could you say
you want to bail

311
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:53,208
after seeing that poor girl?

312
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:56,372
Then let’s call the police,
what are you doing?

313
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:00,124
In-bae.

314
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,956
Think carefully.

315
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,500
Why do you think
Yoo-kyung came to us?

316
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:10,456
She was compelled by videos
made with your technique and editing.

317
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:14,456
Your videos spawned
a $100,000 faith for us!

318
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:17,040
What if she witnesses it live?

319
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,872
Her faith will explode.

320
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,664
“My sister is back,
she’s finally exorcised!”

321
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We get $100,000, and you can
finally take her hand.

322
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,332
Look.

323
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:32,792
See? There’s nothing here.

324
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,208
Don’t be nervous,
just do what we normally do.

325
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,748
Who are we really after?

326
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,832
Right? Go, go, go.

327
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,292
Excuse me!

328
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,248
Excuse me!

329
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,372
Yes?

330
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,956
Why do you have that?
Who did you want to tase?

331
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:55,664
Jesus…

332
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,708
Don’t ever cross this line.

333
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,040
How do you do it, In-bae?

334
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:06,540
What?

335
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,208
I saw it on YouTube.

336
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:12,416
You can see things
that aren’t human too.

337
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:16,624
Well… I, uh…

338
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,832
Either I ward them off,
or reason with them,

339
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,580
I mean, we’re pros…

340
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:25,872
Apprentice Kang’s ability to see
spirits has to be the greatest in…

341
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,708
I’ve seen a ton since
I was a child.

342
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:31,540
So, I got used to them
for the most part.

343
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:39,292
Even some seen on your videos
felt very ordinary.

344
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:45,040
Actually, it feels good to see them.

345
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,332
It’s like spotting rabid dogs
and avoiding them.

346
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:56,080
But this time it’s about my sister,

347
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,292
so, I can’t just run away.

348
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:05,124
God of the five directions,
ward off vile spirits!

349
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,624
You can see it too.

350
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:14,500
Anyone you can see
who aren’t alive

351
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,956
will be exorcised.

352
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:31,624
Mister.

353
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:39,372
Are you a shaman?

354
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:44,124
I’m a doctor, actually.

355
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,248
I came to fix your sister.

356
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,708
Oh, this?

357
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:58,080
You know what?

358
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,500
This is fake.

359
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,872
Keep this a secret from her.

360
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,416
My sister’s lying about
seeing ghosts, right?

361
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:15,124
She said a ghost is inside me.

362
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:24,872
A famous shaman used this
a long time ago,

363
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:29,332
he said when a bad ghost
is inside a person, it’ll ring.

364
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,372
But it has never rung so far.

365
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:35,664
Even now.

366
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,708
The bell is ringing.

367
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,664
What are you?

368
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:05,456
Who are you?

369
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:24,748
What’s going on?
It’s not me!

370
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,540
No!

371
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:31,580
It’s you.

372
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:37,500
What a fresh scheme,
a scam pretending to be a scammer?

373
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,664
Dr. Cheon...

374
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,624
in front of me!

375
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:00,748
Master.

376
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,748
Are you all right?

377
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:09,872
She saw me.

378
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:14,792
She looked straight at me.

379
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,372
Are you inside, sir?

380
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,580
Enter.

381
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,456
Both men left,
and 2 girls remained.

382
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:23,832
We messed up the entire village
to find the eye…

383
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,792
What’s with the girl
master couldn’t possess?

384
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:29,000
What about her?

385
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,664
I mean, if we just get her eyes,
he’ll be unchained,

386
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:37,416
and we can all leave Gwechun, right?

387
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,372
That’s right.

388
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:41,748
But the Chilsung sword
wielder showed up.

389
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:48,292
<i>Didn’t the master eliminate</i>
<i>all of them in the past?</i>

390
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:51,332
<i>I guess there was a leftover.</i>

391
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:54,164
Mr. Hwang.

392
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:56,916
Doc is acting weird.

393
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,416
He’s been weird for a while.

394
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:00,748
No, he’s really weird this time.

395
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,080
Come on, doc…

396
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:10,708
All right, I'm sorry...

397
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:12,332
You should’ve said so,

398
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,748
why did you suddenly
decide to drive yourself?

399
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,540
Dr. Cheon?  Doc!

400
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,956
Go to Mr. Hwang
and tell him the bell rang.

401
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Bell?

402
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,332
What bell?

403
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,292
<i>No!</i>

404
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,372
<i>Dr. Cheon, in front of me…</i>

405
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,708
Where are you?!

406
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,416
<i>Keep it down, will you?</i>

407
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,708
Whatever you’re planning,
don’t do it.

408
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,208
Just walk away
and get out of there!

409
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:49,664
Answer me!

410
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:52,664
<i>Do you remember the diner </i>
<i>on Taeahn-bound route 29?</i>

411
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,208
<i>See you there.</i>

412
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,624
Cheon Dong-sik! Dong-sik!

413
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,456
What’s this about?

414
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:01,372
What are you doing?

415
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:08,164
What is he carrying?

416
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:15,872
It looked like you were grabbing
a trident to kill someone.

417
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,664
“Where are you?!”

418
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,872
But you grabbed a drum?

419
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:23,372
Are you joining a cheerleading squad?

420
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:26,040
Watch your mouth,
you’ll go to hell.

421
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:28,956
This is a holy object.

422
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,416
From a bell to a drum,
what’s the big deal?

423
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,664
You don’t even explain
a damn thing.

424
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,500
How long have you worked
with Dr. Cheon?

425
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:41,664
He contacted me when I uploaded
a ghost prank video, so 3 years?

426
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:43,916
You must know that he’s from
a chief shaman family.

427
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,792
Of course, shaman this,
chief shaman that...

428
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:50,708
I don’t exactly know
what that means though.

429
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,792
Know what a deity shrine is?

430
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,456
It’s the name of the famous bakery.

431
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:56,500
Bak…

432
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:03,456
You’ve been freeloading
all this time?

433
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,916
I’m just a technician.

434
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,580
Even if you are, oh man…

435
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,040
Those big totems at
the entrance of a village?

436
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,580
Sure.

437
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,872
That’s called a deity shrine,

438
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:18,792
<i>it’s where the village guardians reside.</i>

439
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:23,164
<i>The chief shaman’s job is</i>
<i>to protect and maintain that site.</i>

440
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:28,332
<i>And Dr. Cheon’s grandfather</i>
<i>was a chief shaman.</i>

441
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,332
<i>Did you know</i>

442
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,916
<i>Dr. Cheon had a brother?</i>

443
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,872
<i>Is that right?</i>

444
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:38,664
<i>He inherited his grandfather’s skills,</i>

445
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:41,456
<i>and made incredible Seolgyeongs.</i>

446
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,292
<i>Seolgyeong?</i>

447
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:47,416
<i>It’s a talisman that traps ghosts.</i>

448
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:53,292
<i>But Dr. Cheon had no interest</i>
<i>in becoming the chief shaman.</i>

449
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,708
<i>So, the role of chief shaman</i>

450
00:34:56,916 --> 00:35:00,164
<i>was handed down</i>
<i>to his brother instead.</i>

451
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:10,916
<i>One day, his brother disappeared.</i>

452
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:21,124
<i>The chief shaman was desperate</i>
<i>to get the boy back,</i>

453
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:26,124
<i>and performed a ritual for 4 days</i>
<i>without eating or sleeping.</i>

454
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:39,080
He’s here! He’s finally here!

455
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,832
The Great Chilsung deity is here!

456
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:45,664
Of course! I’m here!

457
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:50,624
I came down since you
called for me so earnestly!

458
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:56,872
We’re trying to find Cheon Dong-woo,
the chief shaman’s grandson!

459
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,208
Please point us
to his general direction!

460
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,580
The binding curse must be undone
for the boy to live!

461
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:00,580
<i>So, did he find the boy?</i>

462
00:37:01,124 --> 00:37:03,248
He’s dead, because of Dr. Cheon.

463
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
What?!

464
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,748
At least that’s what he believes.

465
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,416
<i>That’s when we realized,</i>

466
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:16,124
<i>his grandfather was hunted down.</i>

467
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,040
<i>His brother was used</i>
<i>as a bait to kill the chief shaman.</i>

468
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:27,580
<i>Afterwards, I raised Dr. Cheon</i>
<i>in secrecy by changing his name,</i>

469
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,456
<i>but there’s no way</i>
<i>he grew up properly.</i>

470
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,372
<i>In an attempt to find the one</i>
<i>who killed his family, </i>

471
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,624
<i>he chased after so many shamans</i>

472
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:39,792
only to become one himself.

473
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,956
That’s why he’s so hard
on people, especially me.

474
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,872
Hm?

475
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,832
Huh?

476
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,624
Mom…

477
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,748
Who is it?

478
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,000
Who is it?

479
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:56,832
<i>Yoo-kyung!</i>

480
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,540
Mr. Foreman, good evening.

481
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,832
One moment.

482
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:14,080
This was delicious.

483
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,624
Is the moving prep going well?

484
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,540
Yes, thanks to you.

485
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,540
Not at all.

486
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:35,792
So, you’re playing dumb
even after seeing me?

487
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:43,664
Such clear eyes…

488
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:53,624
Damn…

489
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:58,956
Are you okay?

490
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:06,124
Yoo-min!

491
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,580
Yoo-kyung!

492
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:46,916
Yoo-min!

493
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:50,708
Yoo-kyung!

494
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:14,040
I’ll get the car.

495
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:19,208
Tie me.

496
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:28,540
Kill the broken sword wielder.

497
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:39,372
Dr. Cheon!

498
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,000
This way!

499
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,248
Who’s there?

500
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:07,916
Mi-soon?

501
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,208
Shit...

502
00:44:46,456 --> 00:44:47,540
Dammit!

503
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,248
Step on it!

504
00:46:06,456 --> 00:46:08,456
How dare you wimp out?

505
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,208
You should be thinking about
filling up the damaged goods.

506
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,708
Who’ll step up?

507
00:46:49,832 --> 00:46:51,248
Bring it.

508
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,292
What took you so long?

509
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,124
Didn’t clock out yet?

510
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,872
Our company could go belly up
because the boss is acting out,

511
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:39,708
how could the VP just go home?

512
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,748
Jesus Christ…

513
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:43,500
VP my ass, you could
at least not pass out.

514
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:46,872
Pass out? Yoo-kyung tased me…

515
00:47:51,248 --> 00:47:53,080
Shoes, your shoes…

516
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,040
Say hello.

517
00:47:55,332 --> 00:47:57,292
This is Mr. Hwang,
he came to help us.

518
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,456
And here, you heard about her?

519
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,456
Ms. Oh Yoo-kyung.

520
00:48:03,164 --> 00:48:04,748
Thank you for coming.

521
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,916
Sure.

522
00:48:07,956 --> 00:48:09,540
Yoo-kyung, put this on,

523
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:11,956
let’s go sit down,
come up the stairs.

524
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:16,416
Wait, I need a word.

525
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:20,416
Are you nuts?!

526
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,956
Even your grandfather
couldn’t do this.

527
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:30,708
What if you get killed
in the name of revenge?!

528
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,500
This isn’t about revenge.

529
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,332
We’re doing a job for our client.

530
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,208
You always nagged me for being
the grandson of a chief shaman.

531
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:44,664
You know I’ll go to hell
if I do not accept my fate.

532
00:48:44,956 --> 00:48:47,872
You got no spiritual energy,
but got a tongue instead…

533
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,248
I got no spiritual energy,
but sword energy though.

534
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,664
I shouldn’t have given it to you.

535
00:49:06,372 --> 00:49:10,664
This was used by him
until a few hours ago.

536
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:11,748
Jeez…

537
00:49:12,372 --> 00:49:15,124
You know where we can go
to find out who wrote this.

538
00:49:15,832 --> 00:49:18,708
I’ve been called a scammer
for 10 years in pursuit of him,

539
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,124
and I finally got on his trail.

540
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:35,080
Celestial Maiden<i></i>

541
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:33,332
After predicting accurate
general election results,

542
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:36,624
everyone including prosecutors,
VPs, and their wives all visit him,

543
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:39,956
it takes 2 months to
get a reservation.

544
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:45,500
You gotta be at my level
to get a reservation instantly.

545
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:48,580
Some of us drive all over
the country to put on shows,

546
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:51,540
but he managed to
raise a building sitting down.

547
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:54,456
It’s to pay your salary.

548
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,372
Let’s head inside.

549
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:00,500
Do I get paid that much?

550
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:10,748
Yoo-kyung, I mean, Yoo-min,
$25,000 for her location,

551
00:50:10,832 --> 00:50:12,664
another $25,000 after finding her.

552
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:22,372
Mr. Hwang, you’re too much.

553
00:50:23,124 --> 00:50:27,832
You saw how people
dropped dead chasing this thing.

554
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,872
Go on.

555
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:37,708
Please ask the celestial maiden
where they took her.

556
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:40,416
Where this talisman
is linked to,

557
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:45,040
just give us a cardinal direction,
and we’ll leave.

558
00:50:50,872 --> 00:50:52,500
I’m begging you.

559
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,292
Begin.

560
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:37,080
Here she comes!

561
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,664
Here she comes!

562
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:45,580
I feel her!

563
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:48,916
The maiden is coming!

564
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,416
Welcome!

565
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,332
She’s coming!

566
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,372
The maiden is coming!

567
00:52:13,748 --> 00:52:15,080
Celestial maiden!

568
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,080
I feel her!

569
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,832
Here she is!

570
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:26,500
Here she comes!

571
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:43,832
I told him to throw
this tacky thing away!

572
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,540
I see it, I see it…

573
00:52:53,956 --> 00:52:55,124
I see it!

574
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:57,040
I see those bastards!

575
00:53:06,872 --> 00:53:14,456
This vile thing snuck in
because you brought this dirty thing.

576
00:53:20,372 --> 00:53:21,832
By the way,

577
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,792
kid, you there.

578
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:28,416
You saw me earlier.

579
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,916
We locked eyes, right?

580
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:34,332
Yes.

581
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:41,372
You can see the dead,
souls and deities…

582
00:53:42,164 --> 00:53:43,956
No wonder the mage wants them.

583
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:47,872
I get why he wants to pull
those eyes out for keepsake.

584
00:53:48,248 --> 00:53:51,416
Why’d anyone pull her eyes out
for no reason, what a lunatic...

585
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:55,124
You don’t know?

586
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,872
It’s because of his grandpa.

587
00:54:00,456 --> 00:54:03,580
<i>To get rid of </i>
<i>the old man’s Seolgyeong,</i>

588
00:54:03,956 --> 00:54:06,872
he wants this child’s eyes.

589
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:13,292
She possesses eyes
that can evaporate Seolgyeong.

590
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,372
<i>To become a deity,</i>
<i>the mage that you’re chasing,</i>

591
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,292
<i>has been hunting down shamans</i>
<i>for their spiritual powers.</i>

592
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:29,708
<i>And your grandfather was</i>
<i>caught in his trap.</i>

593
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:32,456
Dong-woo!

594
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,792
Grandpa…

595
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,664
I’m here, don’t worry.

596
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,500
<i>He puts severed fingers</i>
<i>in bamboo tubes, </i>

597
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:49,500
<i>and uses their spiritual power</i>
<i>to possess humans.</i>

598
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:59,872
<i>He possessed your brother</i>
<i>and bit down on your grandfather.</i>

599
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:07,372
<i>But who was your grandfather?</i>

600
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,916
<i>The only shaman who could</i>
<i>trap the mage inside a Seolgyeong.</i>

601
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:15,708
<i>That’s what your grandfather</i>
<i>was capable of. </i>

602
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:35,956
<i>But the mage held off</i>
<i>the Seolgyeong chains.</i>

603
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:41,040
<i>He had no choice but to</i>
<i>break the Chilsung sword,</i>

604
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,080
<i>and tried to save your brother.</i>

605
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:02,708
<i>That’s how the Seolgyeong</i>
<i>was cut in half…</i>

606
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:14,332
<i>and your grandfather was stabbed.</i>

607
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:22,956
<i>But thanks to Seolgyeong,</i>

608
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,080
<i>a binding curse was in place,</i>

609
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,872
<i>limiting him to Mt. Jukak</i>
<i>to the North,</i>

610
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:28,624
<i>and Mt. Geumak to the South.</i>

611
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:32,000
<i>he was essentially locked up</i>
<i>in that tiny village.</i>

612
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:38,580
Since then, he’s been desperately
trying to get rid of the Seolgyeong,

613
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:44,456
but this can’t be destroyed
by ordinary means.

614
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,664
A potent talisman like this

615
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:57,664
can’t be ripped up,
or burned either.

616
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:11,956
This has to be read backwards,

617
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:14,456
and you...

618
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:17,916
should be able to see
what’s written on it.

619
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,372
Your eyes are capable of it.

620
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,372
What’s supposed to be there?
Is this all bullshit?

621
00:57:32,372 --> 00:57:33,872
Quiet!

622
00:57:54,372 --> 00:57:55,956
Very good.

623
00:57:57,124 --> 00:58:00,372
You saw it, you did.

624
00:58:01,664 --> 00:58:02,500
So?

625
00:58:05,664 --> 00:58:07,124
Can’t read it?

626
00:58:07,956 --> 00:58:09,580
If you can’t...

627
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:18,292
draw it.

628
00:58:37,664 --> 00:58:39,372
Good.

629
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:42,956
Incredible.

630
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:53,000
You must read this backwards
to get rid of the talisman.

631
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,248
“Jigae jimoon ahhoryung.”

632
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,872
That’s enough,
he’s using you as a puppet.

633
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:22,000
Even if you save her sister,
the mage will come after you.

634
00:59:22,164 --> 00:59:24,540
Then I must complete
my grandfather’s Seolgyeong,

635
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:29,124
and seal him up for good.

636
00:59:29,164 --> 00:59:30,372
You?

637
00:59:31,624 --> 00:59:37,372
Boy, that bastard’s
already half ghost.

638
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:42,624
You don’t even have
a guardian watching over you!

639
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:48,164
Even your powerful grandpa failed
and he’s now floating the afterlife,

640
00:59:48,624 --> 00:59:52,292
you think you can do something
by swinging your sword?

641
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,916
As if seeing your grandpa
and brother dead...

642
00:59:58,624 --> 01:00:00,164
Holy shit!

643
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,248
Excuse me.

644
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:28,080
No one can see you besides me.

645
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,624
It won’t work on him.

646
01:00:31,624 --> 01:00:32,540
Huh?

647
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:37,164
What is everyone looking at?
What’s going on?

648
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:40,580
- Hey, hey!
- Is something there?

649
01:00:41,624 --> 01:00:43,540
- Hey, stop!
- Right here?

650
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,372
Here?

651
01:00:58,832 --> 01:01:00,500
Why was I lying down?

652
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,040
Look at this guy.

653
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:14,916
Yoo-kyung has the eyes,

654
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,000
I got the sword,

655
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:19,372
we can do it.

656
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,916
Working together in unison?

657
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,580
We’ll put two halves
of the Seolgyeong and insert this.

658
01:01:32,124 --> 01:01:36,832
Just tell us where the mage sealed
the other half of the Seolgyeong.

659
01:01:46,664 --> 01:01:47,748
Mt...

660
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,080
Yong…

661
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,624
wol.

662
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,872
Mt. Yongwol!

663
01:01:58,164 --> 01:02:02,500
They’re going after
the other half of the Seolgyeong!

664
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,208
In-bae, wake up!

665
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,872
This is big, so big…

666
01:02:15,956 --> 01:02:17,664
What’s going on?

667
01:02:20,832 --> 01:02:22,332
Where am I?

668
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,916
We’re very close to the spot
that the celestial maiden told us.

669
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,664
There’s nothing here,
did we get scammed?

670
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:34,372
In-bae, light it up,
with the biggest one.

671
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:36,332
High and wide.

672
01:02:37,332 --> 01:02:38,040
Okay!

673
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:39,956
Okay?

674
01:02:45,832 --> 01:02:49,000
You guys carry around
so much crap…

675
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,956
How do you bring just a drum
on a job like this?

676
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:57,792
It’ll be like when you were
looking at the talisman.

677
01:02:58,664 --> 01:03:02,040
Imagine a big talisman
hiding somewhere out there.

678
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:04,956
Ready?

679
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:06,956
Yes.

680
01:03:22,416 --> 01:03:23,332
1 minute.

681
01:03:32,832 --> 01:03:33,832
30 seconds.

682
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:55,872
Over there!

683
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:56,956
Let’s move!

684
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,080
Wait a minute!

685
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:33,832
Shit, I should’ve just clocked out…

686
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:45,208
You are all screwed.

687
01:04:55,748 --> 01:04:56,708
It’s okay.

688
01:05:01,124 --> 01:05:03,372
Hey, hey!

689
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:47,248
- Doc!
- In-bae!

690
01:05:50,372 --> 01:05:53,124
My foot! Why is my foot like this?

691
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,164
My foot! Oh my god!

692
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,580
- What’s wrong?!
- In-bae!

693
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,208
- It’s gone!
- You got a foot!

694
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,580
- My foot!
- It’s there!

695
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,080
- My foot’s gone!
- It’s okay, In-bae!

696
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:04,872
It’s gone!

697
01:06:04,872 --> 01:06:06,624
Snap out of it,
it’s a mirage!

698
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,248
My foot’s gone! Gone!

699
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,332
Grandpa...

700
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:19,416
Dong-woo...

701
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,540
What about Seolgyeong?

702
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,664
Did you find it?

703
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,292
Damn pests...

704
01:09:09,372 --> 01:09:11,748
Eh? My foot.

705
01:09:12,164 --> 01:09:13,164
My foot’s back.

706
01:09:14,456 --> 01:09:16,540
Doc, my foot came back!

707
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:17,708
In-bae!

708
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,456
Shit!

709
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,080
Mt. Jukak to the North,

710
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:24,748
Mt. Jukak<i></i>

711
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:29,832
Mt. Geumak to the South,
that’s his boundary.

712
01:09:26,248 --> 01:09:28,124
Mt. Geumak<i></i>

713
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:34,832
Kangryung Tunnel<i></i>

714
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:34,832
This is where the celestial maiden
told us about,

715
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:36,580
Mt. Yongwol.

716
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,500
The mage’s location is...

717
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:45,664
here.

718
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,332
What are you doing?

719
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,872
Come to Seoul with me.

720
01:10:11,956 --> 01:10:13,872
What’s with you all of sudden?

721
01:10:14,332 --> 01:10:17,580
The master will be freed
when we pull her eyes out.

722
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:21,916
He’s bound to do great things
when he reaches Seoul.

723
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,748
Why run away now?

724
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:26,956
Do you know what happened
just now in Mt. Yongwol?

725
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,372
The shrine collapsed.

726
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:32,872
What do you mean?

727
01:10:32,872 --> 01:10:34,540
You know what that place is,

728
01:10:34,748 --> 01:10:37,208
the master plastered it
with talismans.

729
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:40,248
And he killed so many people
to make those talismans.

730
01:10:41,248 --> 01:10:43,664
What happened to
the Seolgyeong inside?

731
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:10,456
Don’t be mistaken,
it wasn’t me.

732
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,664
Mom…

733
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:40,748
Step on it!

734
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:19,708
Doctor!

735
01:13:25,332 --> 01:13:27,080
Give me your eyes, bitch!

736
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,292
I just need your eyes!

737
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,916
Doctor!

738
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:00,540
Yoo-kyung!

739
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:02,500
Stop right there!

740
01:15:18,872 --> 01:15:20,456
Dr. Cheon, get in!

741
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:23,208
Many lives could have been spared,

742
01:16:23,664 --> 01:16:26,792
had you shown up earlier.

743
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:36,292
Why was I so blind?

744
01:16:38,164 --> 01:16:40,500
You were right in front of me.

745
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:43,248
So cruel.

746
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:56,624
I’ll pull them out painlessly,
and keep them in a special spot.

747
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,580
Rig the cave entrance
with explosives,

748
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:21,540
and when Yoo-kyung comes out
with her sister, blow it up.

749
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:24,124
If you don’t come out,
you’re gonna die?

750
01:17:24,164 --> 01:17:24,832
Shush!

751
01:17:24,832 --> 01:17:27,164
It’s our last chance
to seal the mage inside.

752
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:32,540
Whether inside the cave,
or the Seolgyeong...

753
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,708
That’s not right!

754
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,748
In-bae.

755
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:42,580
Let’s do it properly this time.

756
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,540
I’ll come with you.

757
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,956
I’ll see you when I see you.

758
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,456
Dr. Cheon!

759
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:10,292
You resemble your grandfather

760
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:15,208
more than your dead brother.

761
01:19:46,372 --> 01:19:48,500
So, this is your real face.

762
01:19:49,124 --> 01:19:51,000
Did you want to see me so badly?

763
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:10,164
Yoo-kyung...

764
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:22,708
The Cheon clan seems to be
full of futile men.

765
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,872
We’ll have to see about that.

766
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:54,292
Close your eyes!

767
01:24:54,664 --> 01:24:55,664
Shit, shit!

768
01:25:10,956 --> 01:25:11,708
Go, go!

769
01:25:12,124 --> 01:25:13,000
Doctor!

770
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,916
Seolgyeong! Seolgyeong!

771
01:25:16,456 --> 01:25:17,624
Stab the Seolgyeong!

772
01:25:17,664 --> 01:25:19,456
Where is it?!

773
01:25:20,456 --> 01:25:21,792
We have to go!

774
01:25:29,748 --> 01:25:32,248
You couldn’t come sooner?

775
01:25:45,956 --> 01:25:47,580
Look at that crazy bastard!

776
01:25:47,624 --> 01:25:48,624
Dammit!

777
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:54,372
He’s coming after us!

778
01:26:00,332 --> 01:26:01,500
Mr. Hwang, run!

779
01:26:01,664 --> 01:26:03,500
Hwang! In-bae, push the button!

780
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,080
What is it?!

781
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,540
Push it!

782
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:44,792
I told you to go easy
with explosives!

783
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,332
The Seolgyeong...

784
01:26:55,956 --> 01:26:57,372
Christ...

785
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,332
Here, pierce it with your sword.

786
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,040
So hot! Shit!

787
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,248
What’s happening?

788
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,080
GANG DONG-WON

789
01:32:32,164 --> 01:32:34,664
HUH JOON-HO

790
01:32:36,872 --> 01:32:40,624
ESOM

791
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:43,292
LEE DONG-HWI

792
01:32:44,956 --> 01:32:47,916
KIM JONG-SOO

793
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:52,080
PARK SOI

794
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:55,792
AND PARK JEONG-MIN

795
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:01,248
DIRECTED BY
KIM SEONG-SIK

796
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,500
Yoo-kyung, great work.

797
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:07,540
Yoo-min, listen to your sister,
and be healthy.

798
01:34:08,164 --> 01:34:09,124
Thank you.

799
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,164
Goodbye.

800
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,332
Hope your move goes well,

801
01:34:17,624 --> 01:34:20,040
and give me a call
when you see anything weird.

802
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:22,500
Thank you, doctor.

803
01:34:27,748 --> 01:34:29,916
Thank you, doctor.

804
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:35,164
Let’s get going,
it’s almost rush hour.

805
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:39,956
Let’s go.

806
01:34:40,164 --> 01:34:41,416
Yoo-kyung,

807
01:34:42,456 --> 01:34:47,748
I believe that it’d be a travesty
to waste your incredible talent.

808
01:34:48,248 --> 01:34:51,000
I’d like to formally offer you a job.
