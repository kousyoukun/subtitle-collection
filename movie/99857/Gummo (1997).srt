00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:11,512
Peanut, peanut,

You'll get your ass kicked

'Cause you're a big motherfucker

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:24,107

And Mommy has a pussy

00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,458
Xenia, Ohio.

11
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,798
A few years ago...

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,884
a tornado hit this place.

13
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,435
lt killed the people,
left and right.

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,939
Dogs died. Cats died.

15
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,691
Houses were split open...

16
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,278
and you could see necklaces
hanging from branches of trees.

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,783
People's legs and neck bones
were sticking out.

18
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,079
Oliver found a leg on his roof.

by the great tornado.

Her skull was smashed.
And some kids died.

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,846
My neighbor was killed
in that house.

25
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,932
He used to ride dirt bikes
and three-wheelers.

26
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,602
They never found his head.

27
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,478
l always thought that was funny.

28
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,027
People died in Xenia.

29
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,947

30
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,992

of the diabetes.

00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,068
You have a lump in your titty.

72
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,363
What?

73
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,074
You have a big old lump.

74
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,576
Tummler sees everything.

75
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,663
Some say he's downright evil.

76
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,624
He's got what it takes
to be a legend.

77
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,709
He's got a marvelous persona.

78
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,338
You got this one?

79
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,553
Don't kill the bitch.
lt's a house cat.

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,598
lt's a lesbian cat.

81
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,561
You can tell.

82
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,770
Looks like my mom.

83
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,695
Know what l'm doing tomorrow?

84
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,863
What?

85
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,115
Going to an insane asylum.

86
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,825
lnsane asylum?

87
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,452
Gonna get me a raving beauty.

88
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,247
Foot Foot, where you been?

89
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,838
You smell like a dookie, girl.

90
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,021
Talk to him in school?

91
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,024
l don't know. Some hall.

92
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,026
He smiled.

93
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,652
Don't be such a puss.

94
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,197
l try not to. l'm shy.

95
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,035
Foot Foot, you stink a bitch.
Where'd you find her?

96
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,079
On the porch sleeping
for three hours.

97
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,873
How'd she get out there?

98
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,543
-You left the window cracked.
-No.

99
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,880
-You did.
-lt was not me.

100
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,131
You know
it's always Darby's fault.

101
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,716
She's looking
a little impregnated.

102
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,176
-No.
-She is.

103
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,553
Let's flip her over
and look at her bottom part.

104
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,267
Let me look at you, Foot Foot.

105
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,852
ls it red?

106
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,395
lt's not any red, no.

107
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,856
-ls it swollen?
-No.

108
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,776
An impregnated cat is a bitch.
Like, this cat's pregnant.

109
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,945
Yeah. Tsk. lt's true.

110
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,113
-No, she's not a bitch.
-She is, too.

111
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,115
She's gotten herself
in trouble like this.

112
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,493
-She still has nine nips.
-Nine nips?

113
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,245
Nine lives, too.

114
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,997
lf she is pregnant, we'll drown
the kittens in the creek.

115
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,586
You see? Do it like this.

116
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,463
Get it over all the pink--
around it.

117
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,131
Do it on it real tight.

118
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,717
That tight,
it will get infected.

119
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,178
Don't tell me.
This is the right way.

120
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,430
lf you just do little pats,
it won't raise it.

121
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,892
The whole point is to make it
fatter and pop it out bigger.

122
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,353
-Tight.
-That's tight.

123
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,146
-This gonna hurt?
-lt's not gonna hurt.

124
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,023
We're gonna do it quick.

125
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,734
-Ready?
-Pull it, Dot, pull it!

126
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,946
One, two, three.

127
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,160
They look bigger.

128
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,621
They look a little bigger.
l think they look wider.

129
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,416
The nipple's fatter.

130
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,795
They look redder, but l think
they look much better.

131
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,297
Better nipple.

132
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,756
Every day

133
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,800
lt's a-gettin' closer

134
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,179
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

135
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,264
Love like yours will

136
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,892

137
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,269
A-hey a-hey-hey

lt's a-getting closer

140
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,526
Goin' faster

141
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,653
Love like yours will

142
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,156

143
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,283
A-hey a-hey-hey

Every day, lt's a-gettin' closer

145
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,372
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

146
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,501
Love like yours
will surely come my way

147
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,211
Hey-hey hey-hey-hey

148
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,047
Love like yours

149
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,217
Will surely come my way

150
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,272
What do you want to do?

151
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,652
Wanna keep lookin'?

152
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,449
Go by Dean's place...

153
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,992
back by the dumpsters?

154
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,914
Then let's go get our money.

155
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,376
Let's get some milkshakes.

156
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,127
Milkshakes?

157
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,046
Strawberry milkshake.

158
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,383
lf they don't have strawberry,
l'll get pineapple.

159
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,303
Let's go get our money first.

160
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,560
Does your mom
ever make you food?

161
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,521
-She makes me toast.
-ls that it?

162
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,065
She cooks me lamb chops.

163
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,733
You ever eaten crepe suzette?

164
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,757
Spanker had gravy on his vest...

165
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,595
gravy on his tie,
gravy on his pants...

166
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,096
gravy all over him...

167
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,725
so he went to his grave
with gravy on his vest...

168
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,312
gravy on his tie,
gravy on his pants...

169
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,063
gravy all over him.

170
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,648
That dirty old man.

171
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,617
These two kids l know...

172
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,536
these two brothers...

173
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,498
they murdered their parents.

174
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,376
They both claim to be raised
as Jehovah Witnesses.

175
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,548
They came to school
in really nice shorts...

176
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,928
and polished tennis sneakers...

177
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:46,308
and their shirts were always
collared with buttons...

178
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,770
and their hair
was always slicked back...

179
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,273
their teeth
were always brushed...

180
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:58,445
and their shirts and pants
were always ironed...

181
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,406
and their shoes
never were scuffed up...

182
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,076
or anything like that.

183
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,288
They seemed to have
a wonderful life.

184
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,333
l don't know what went wrong.

185
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,877
Why don't you give me
them shoes?

186
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,672
'Cause they're new,
and l don't give you new shoes.

187
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,882
Yeah, fuck that, man.

188
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,884
l'm keeping this shit
right here.

189
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,553
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

190
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,724
Pissant.

191
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,689
-Fuck him up.
-Aw, get off me, man.

192
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,236
l told you
not to hit me in the face.

193
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,201
-What's up?
-Stop that.

194
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,710
Ooh! Damn!

195
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,631
Shit. Go, fucker.

196
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,014
Let's go.

197
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,641
l'm gonna fuck you up.

198
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,572
Damn! Shit!

199
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,116
Hit a man while he's down.

200
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,993
Shit. All right, all right.

201
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,369
Oh, fuckin'...

202
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,872
Shit, man. Give me them shoes.

203
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,168
So, what's for dinner, man?
You cooking tonight?

204
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,755
l was about four years old
the first time...

205
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,673
and, um...

206
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,344
l remember one time he came home
from work real late...

207
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,095
and l had been sleeping
on the couch...

208
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,057
and he came in,
and he woke me up...

209
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,975
and he laid on top of me...

210
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,020
and he told me, he said,
''Take off your panties.''

211
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,105
And l asked him why.

212
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,733
He said
that he was only playing...

213
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,735
and that
he wasn't gonna hurt me...

214
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,947
and, um, he was gonna
make me feel good.

215
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,866
And l took off my panties,
and then, um...

216
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,118
he got on top of me...

217
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,958
and he was rubbin' and touchin'
and feelin' and laughin'.

218
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,501
And then--and then, um...

219
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,546
he'd wake up in the morning,
and he'd come in my bedroom...

220
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,047
or bring me into his bedroom...

221
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,509
and he would kiss me
and touch me and...

222
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,845
and make me play with him and...

223
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,764
And, you know, at first,
l was real scared.

224
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,057
l didn't know if it was right...

225
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,561
but he would tell me
that we were having fun...

226
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,480
and what we were doing
wasn't wrong...

227
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,148
because he was my dad.

228
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,330
You guys didn't get very many
this time.

229
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,791
Yeah. lt's a scarce count.

230
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,919
Let's see.
Twelve, twelve and a half.

231
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,379
l'll give you thirteen.

232
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,717
lt's gettin' crazy, 'cause
things are startin' to thin out.

233
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,390
You know you guys
got some competition out there?

234
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,475
-What? Who?
-Jarrod.

235
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,810
-Who?
-Jarrod Wiggley.

236
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,353
You know the kid
that lives over by the school?

237
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,731
The one who takes care
of his grandmother?

238
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,400
l know that kid. He used to have
a sister in my class...

239
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,735
but she moved.

240
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,197
Her name was June Wiggley.
We used to call her June bug.

241
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,823
And l noticed something else.

242
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,909
The cats that's usually
out by the garbage cans...

243
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,452
they're not around anymore.

244
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,745
And the Chinese restaurant--

245
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,663
you know the one
that buys all my stuff?

246
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,874
The guy that owns it
had a heart attack and died...

247
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,834
so l guess they're getting ready
to go out of business.

248
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,961
l'm pretty smart,
if l say so myself.

249
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,379
Why is that?

250
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:49,134
This afternoon,
we walked into a fruit store...

251
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,304
and the clerk thought
l was some out-of-town hick.

252
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,349
''Those apples will be
two bucks each,'' he tells me.

253
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,560
That's where l outsmarted him.
l hand over a five...

254
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,979
And as he's about to give me
a dollar change, l say...

255
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,814
''Keep it. We're even.

256
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,651
''On the way in,
l stepped on a grape.''

257
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,736
You want this
by the cat or by the pound?

258
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,946
Don't matter.

259
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,822
l'll give you
a dollar a pound, then.

260
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,120
Hey, uh...

261
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,831
could you hook me up
with some glue?

262
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,374
What kind you want?

263
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,251
Not wood glue.

264
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,670
Not cement glue, either.

265
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,881
Do you have butcher's
model glue, in tins?

266
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,175
Yeah. l'm gonna go get it, man.

267
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,136
Who was it?
Who killed that little baby cat?

268
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,972
-Joseph.
-Was it?

269
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,641
Yeah. lt was ate up
with maggots, though.

270
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,561
They had to kill it.
They're just strays.

271
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,397
All these cats around here
have twenty babies.

272
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,315
Little bitty old black cat.
He wasn't about this long.

273
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,985
We was trying to figure out
how to make it stay away.

274
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,529
Couldn't do it. He said,
''Give me a bottle of gasoline.''

275
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,907
He opened its mouth up
and poured it full of gasoline.

276
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,994
Get that son of a bitch. l ain't
never seen that cat since.

277
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,621
Lit it. Poured gas down it.

278
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:03,041
Poured gas down it, man,
and lit it.

279
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,626
l ain't never killed nothin'...

280
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,673
just to be killing it,
besides that cat.

281
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,342
He lit a cat on fire
for six hours.

282
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,303
Boom ! Boom !

283
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,639
No, l seen somebody put one
in a microwave.

284
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,641
That motherfucker melted.

285
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,561
They got me for a damn BB gun.

286
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,313
You shouldn't have pulled it
on that girl.

287
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,066
l didn't pull it on that girl.
You're crazy!

288
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,111
You're crazy, man.
You're crazy, man.

289
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,654
l didn't pull that BB gun out.

290
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,324
When l went to jail, they put us
in the old juvenile...

291
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,117
because the jails were so full.

292
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,535
lt was one little room...

293
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:42,581
with a big old silver hard bed
on a brick wall.

294
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:46,043
There was eighty-five people
in the same cell with us.

295
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,087
Worst thing l hate about it
was them niggers down there.

296
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,882
l--God, boy, hey, mmm.

297
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,551
They make me so mad, l just want
to tear their head off.

298
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,178
l hate the motherfuckers.

299
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:01,099
l just don't like 'em.

300
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,353
You got them all. lf you
hit one, you get them all.

301
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,271
They have ten
to every one of you.

302
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,149
-They ain't gonna fight fair.
-Unless you got nigger buddies.

303
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:13,153
That's it. lf you got
some good Latin buddies...

304
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,365
l had some good--some good
nigger friends at Pearl.

305
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,085
Solomon...

306
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,462
did your mom find a new house?

307
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,969
l saw a house yesterday...

308
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,387
near my house.

309
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,099
l think it was this lady's.

310
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,021
l saw a sign, ''for sale.''

311
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,107
lt had a bullet hole
in the mailbox.

312
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,775
A hole?

313
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,444
A big old hole.

314
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,201
l think my brother shot it down
when l was younger.

315
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:46,038
l think it was him.

316
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,956
He always used to say...

317
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,293
Roy Orbison
liked to shoot at things.

318
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,796
Roy always wore
these dark sunglasses.

319
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:59,343
My brother always wore
the same kind of sunglasses.

320
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,137
He sang that song ''Crying.''
You know that song?

321
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,722
What?

322
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,807
That song ''Crying.''

323
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,228
Cryin'

324
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,979
Over you

325
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,525
Cryin'

326
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,568
Over you

327
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,574
My brother
used to sing ''Crying.''

328
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,660
Where is he now?

329
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,869
My brother?

330
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,166
He's in the big city.

331
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,709
He took off in a bus.

332
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,258
He was a queer.

333
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,467
He's a queer now.

334
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,720
Your brother is?

335
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:48,475
Yeah. He dressed like ladies.

336
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,353
He wore skirts and lipsticks.

337
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,065
He wore stockings, eyeliner.

338
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:58,068
He even has boobs.

339
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,163
Girl?

340
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,373
Pretty much.

341
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,041
Was he pretty?

342
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,212
l don't know. l guess so.

343
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,298
l guess he was pretty.

344
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,844
Pretty enough
to have a boyfriend.

345
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,938
Cops
will frickin' catch your ass.

346
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,523
Fuck the cops!

347
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,526
l know, man.
Cops can kiss my ass.

348
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,237
All they are is assholes.

349
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,948
l know, man.
What's the matter with them?

350
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,868
They mad 'cause
we get more pussy than they do?

351
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:54,583
Damn you, rabbit!
You smell like fuckin' piss!

352
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,793
You can kiss my ass!

00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,048
l hate the goddamned rabbit.

354
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,550
Fuckin' rabbit!

Kill his ass!

356
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,932
l don't like rabbits
comin' to my fuckin' house.

357
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,600
l kill them.

358
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,812
l got 'im.

359
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,690
-No, you didn't!
-Yes, l did!

360
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,777
He looks like a queer rabbit!
All queer!

361
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,614
That fag! He can kiss my ass!

362
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,116
Rabbits are queers!

363
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,995
They always got to shit
on themselves!

364
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,791
Ah, those little queer-ass
rabbits.

365
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,127
Hey, look at these little fag
bunny ears.

366
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,297
Fuckin' rabbit.
l'm sick and tired of it.

367
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,217
-This shitty-ass rabbit stinks!
-l know.

368
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,594
He smells like pussy!

369
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,596
He smells like an asshole!

370
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,807
Hey, motherfucker!

371
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,976
Smells like wetback dick!

372
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:58,146
They smell like
a pound of bullshit!

373
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,067
ls it dead?

374
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,319
l don't know,
but l'm gonna make sure.

375
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,744
-l wonder if he's dead.
-Got some big-ass nostrils.

376
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,707
Hate fuckin' rabbits.

377
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,174
l wonder if he's got any money.

378
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,217
Check his pockets.

379
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,061
Don't even got
that much meat on him.

380
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,191
Got too much grease on my gun.

381
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,694
-That rabbit can kiss my ass.
-Come on, let's go, man.

382
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,491
Who gives a shit about rabbits?

383
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,748
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

384
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,501
H, l, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

385
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,003
Q, R, S, T, U, V

386
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,839
W, X, and Y and Z

387
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,634
Now l know my ABCs

388
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,094
Next time,
won't you sing with me?

389
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,764
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

390
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,308
H, l, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

391
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,894
Q, R, S, T, U, V

392
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,647
W, X, and Y and Z

393
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,741
-Ellen, how you doing?
-Hey.

394
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,326
What's up with you?

395
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,578
You good?

396
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,708
He got a haircut.

397
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,252
He looks pretty.

398
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,422
His thighs are getting stronger.

399
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,884
Eddie!

400
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,266
Hi, Dot. Hi, Helen.

401
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,268
My backhand really sucks.

402
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,436
-No, it doesn't.
-Yeah, it does.

403
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,647
l think your playing
looks much better.

404
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,566
l got second
in the tournament last week.

405
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:09,069
-Really?
-Yep. My serve got faster.

406
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,779
lncreased by eight percent.

407
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,115
l can hit a ball
up to sixty-five miles an hour.

408
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:15,325
You got that way
from practicin'?

409
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,828
No. l got this thing
called A.D.D.

410
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,165
lt's an attention disorder.

411
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,916
lt affects the nervous system.

412
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,753
Makes it hard to concentrate.

413
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,630
Makes it hard?

414
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,924
Makes it hard, 'cause, like...

415
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,302
before l knew l had A.D.D...

416
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,761
l wouldn't really
go for the ball...

417
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,556
l wouldn't run the extra mile.

418
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:42,394
Yeah, but it's hard to explain.

419
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:46,315
l take ritalin,
this kind of prescription drug.

420
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,067
lt's not like a drug
that fucks you up.

421
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,695
lf anything,
it makes you normal.

422
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,574
He just likes to go out
with skinny girls.

423
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,367
-How do you know?
-l just know.

424
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,577
Who told you?

425
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,329
His last girlfriend
used to be anorexic.

426
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,372
-Was she bulimic?
-l don't know.

427
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,166
l'll bet
she was a bulimic puker...

428
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,502
with white spots on her teeth.

429
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,421
l don't know. She used to run
track after school...

430
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,131
and this girl said,
''There goes Eddie's girl.''

431
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:13,884
And l thought, ''What for?
That girl's so skinny.''

432
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:16,386
-They broke up, right?
-Mm-hmm. A while ago.

433
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,139
-Skin and bones.
-Mm-hmm. She was so skinny...

434
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,099
she had to wear rubber bands
around the tops of her socks...

435
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,185
and a belt around her spandex
bike shorts to keep them up.

436
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,312
-No, she didn't.
-Uh-huh.

437
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,356
Kids in school
used to laugh so hard.

438
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,358
Sure.

439
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,944
lt's crazy, so crazy.

440
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,695
Guess l'm not skinny enough
for him, then.

441
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,614
-You are.
-No.

442
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,699
Uh-huh. At least
if he goes out with you...

443
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,076
you'll know he got good taste.

444
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,538
-We'll see.
-Mm-hmm.

445
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,290
We'll see if it happens,
is what we'll see.

446
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,256
l was born
right here in Xenia, Ohio...

447
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,259
to a lesbian midwife...

448
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,387
who cut all her hair
like a butch.

449
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,892
And when l was little,
she used to have stre--

450
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,435
My mom
used to have stretch marks...

451
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,312
that went around in circles.

452
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,575
But l used to roll marbles
on her stomach--

453
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,369
my mom's stomach--and when
l would hit the navel...

454
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,997
she'd give me five dollars.

455
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,374
When l'd hit the navel,
she'd give me five dollars.

456
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,293
When l would hit
the side of her arm...

457
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,295
she would fuckin' hit me, man...

458
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,630
with a--a fuckin'...

459
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,924
a--a--a hairbrush...

460
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,552
or she would beat me...

461
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:42,431
l had a lesbian midwife
who gave birth to my mother...

462
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,267
while l was born
through my mother's womb.

463
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,935
My mother,
when she was thirty years old...

464
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,103
she entered menopause.

465
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,356
She sprouted a fuckin' mustache.
She lost her sex drive.

466
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:54,193
Everything in the house
started to change.

467
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,111
The way she would do the dishes
would change...

468
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,405
or the way
she would clean the cabinets...

469
00:28:58,447 --> 00:28:59,990
out of the house would change.

470
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,701
OK, so my sister,
she gets a complex.

471
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:07,122
She starts thinking, because
my mother has menopause...

472
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,542
at such an earlier--
at such an early age...

473
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,045
that she's gonna lose
all her sex drive...

474
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,465
and then her mustache is gonna
come out like my mom's mustache.

475
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,634
l can't shoot ball
like Michael Jordan can...

476
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,678
but that's all right, though,
you know?

477
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,640
l'm also gay.

478
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,315
Don't be nervous.

479
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,900
l ain't being nervous.

480
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:45,744
Now, there's something
special about you.

481
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,205
Something special l want.

482
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:49,748
Will you kiss me?

483
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,585
You're not gay.

484
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,220
lt's all right.

485
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:10,644
My mother rejected me,
my father rejected me.

486
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,771
There was no love
in the household.

487
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,399
l was beaten, l was abused.

488
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,026
l had people stick shit
up my rectum.

489
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,070
Will you hug me? Just hug me.

490
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,114
-l'll give you a hug, man.
-Just hug me.

491
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:25,075
Seriously,
just calm down, just hug me.

492
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,952
Just give me some warmth.

493
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:30,080
Just hug.

494
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:34,084
Just hug me for a little bit,
because l'm so lonely.

495
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,753
l'm so--l've got no one.

496
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,091
There's no one left.
l've got no one left.

497
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,719
l've got no one to love me
anymore.

498
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,430
l'll die here on this couch
with you.

499
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:55,063
My father worked the late shift
as a bathroom attendant.

500
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:59,359
My father was mugged
on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

501
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,361
For the rest of his days
on earth...

502
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:04,198
my father never celebrated
this holiday.

503
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,999
-With my sister.
-With your sister?

504
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,960
Wait till her husband finds out.

505
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,254
Oh, shit,
don't do nothing about it.

506
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,298
You'll come up dead,
laying in a ditch.

507
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,219
Yeah, you did, you liar.

508
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,221
No, l didn't. l never hit it.

509
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,015
Well, shoot,
you never know about that.

510
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,854
You Jarrod Wiggley?

511
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:39,233
You know Huntz?

512
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,694
He told me some stuff about you.

513
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,947
What did he say?

514
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,908
He said you'd been killing cats.

515
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,036
For, like, the past three weeks.

516
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,414
When do you go out?

517
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,917
Do it during the day usually?

518
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,586
No. l do it mostly at night.

519
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,172
You shoot 'em?

520
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,967
No. l put glass in tuna fish.

521
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:09,012
But mostly, l sprinkle poison
around the dumpsters...

522
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,597
like in the corners...

523
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,101
or around back
behind the church over there.

524
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,478
Huntz said
you take care of your granny.

525
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,231
Yeah. She's sick.

526
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,983
How old is she?

527
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:25,654
She's, like, l don't know,
probably ninety or ninety-one.

528
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:28,073
-Do you bathe her?
-Yeah.

529
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,451
l have to scrub her off
with a big sponge.

530
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,287
Do you have to change
her diaper?

531
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:37,249
Yeah. l hate that shit.
l hate all that shit.

532
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,876
Does she speak to herself?

533
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:43,463
No. She don't speak anymore.
She's catatonic.

534
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,383
She used to speak to herself.
She'd watch game shows...

535
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,720
and yell out
stuff to herself all the time.

536
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,014
She used to throw darts, right?

537
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,183
Yeah.
She used to have a dartboard.

538
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,352
So now you just take care
of your granny?

539
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,814
You kill cats, too?

540
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:06,695
l'm sick of everything.

541
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:11,116
l can't understand what the fuck
is wrong with people...

542
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,409
in this world.

543
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:16,914
They sit around. They don't know
what the fuck is going on.

544
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,082
-They're stupid.
-Fuck, they're ignorant.

545
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:23,795
They're--they're fuckers.
l fuckin' hate myself.

546
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:26,507
They--they--they...

547
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:31,720
sit there in their pretend
little lives...

548
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,430
in their homes...

549
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,100
Hold on. Cassidey.

550
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:43,023
What's up, man?

551
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,069
-How you doin'?
-Good. You?

552
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,612
Yeah, good.

553
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,072
You guys ride your bikes
over here?

554
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,410
You bring me--
You brought my money?

555
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,246
-Yeah. Right here.
-Good.

556
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,081
Come on, let's go in the house.
Come on.

557
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,085
Man.

558
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,922
l got to tell you,
she had a migraine headache...

559
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,215
earlier today.

560
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,926
She almost wanted to call
the whole thing off, OK?

561
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,220
But l gave her--
l gave her some aspirin.

562
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,890
Cool. Hey, thanks a lot.

563
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,189
-l'm gonna go fuck her now.
-Wait. You want to fuck her?

564
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,149
Are you gonna fuck her, too?

565
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,527
All right, you got to hold on.

566
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,825
Hey, Cassidey.

567
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,702
Hey, put on that bathrobe thing.

568
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:40,873
Hey, put that on.

569
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,082
All right.

570
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,418
She's ready.

571
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,132
-You ready?
-Yeah.

572
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,968
OK, you got
to keep the light on.

573
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,136
All right.

574
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:57,806
You all right?

575
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:39,973
You good?

576
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,320
You ready?

577
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,203
All right, come on.

578
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,975
Hi, Solly.

579
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,810
Are you clean?

580
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,187
Did you use soap?

581
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,064
Let me smell your wrist.

582
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,278
Smells good.

583
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,573
-How does it smell like?
-Like fruit, like cherries.

584
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,325
My mom gives me cherry shampoo.

585
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,081
l like cherries.

586
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,458
l put cherries on my ice cream.

587
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,461
l like the name of cherry.
Cherries.

588
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,761
You got hands like a girl.

589
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,054
No, l don't.

590
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:04,641
Yes, you do.

591
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,191
Can l read your fortune?

592
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:18,989
This big line says
you're gonna be a millionaire.

593
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,949
lt says your--

594
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:25,037
lt says your wife will die
in a hay fire.

595
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,246
But l don't have a wife.

596
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,790
You will,
but it ain't gonna be me.

597
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,689
-Do you love me?
-Yes.

598
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,149
Do you think l'm attractive?

599
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:57,611
No. You look fine
the way you are--skinny.

600
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:00,405
When l sit down to eat,
l get sexy!

601
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,116
When l go to bed, l get hungry!

602
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:06,620
l saw a man lying in the street,
and l said, ''Can l help you?''

603
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,289
He said, ''No.
l just found a parking space.

604
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,792
''Now l sent my wife
to go buy a car!''

605
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:15,420
lt's just murder what's going on
with people these days.

606
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:18,131
Just the other day,
right here in Xenia, Ohio...

607
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:21,134
a man walked up to me and said,
''l haven't eaten in 3 days.''

608
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:22,803
l said, ''Force yourself!''

609
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,514
Another man
walked up to me and said...

610
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:26,682
''l haven't eaten in a week!''

611
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:29,560
l said, ''Don't worry.
lt tastes the same!''

612
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,939
All right! We're rolling!
l love this crowd!

613
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,814
Peoples got to work
for a livin'.

614
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:00,192
l believe in a blue-collar race.

615
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:03,779
l think suicide's
the only way out--out of life.

616
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:08,033
l wanted to die.
l tried to die, but l didn't.

617
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,663
They say it's my depression,
but what the fuck, man?

618
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,790
l don't fuckin' know anymore.

619
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,168
Which way
should l fuckin' turn, man?

620
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:44,194
Shut up!

621
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,696
-l hate that dog.
-l hate it, too.

622
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:46,864
lt's mean and ugly.

623
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,825
lt's got two sets of teeth,
like a shark.

624
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,661
That's why Roy calls it Sharky.

625
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:54,997
Yeah. The other day l saw it
eating a turkey bone.

626
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,499
l swear it looked like
it was choking on the bone.

627
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,084
l wish it would choke
and shut up.

628
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,587
Yeah. l was gonna go tell
Miss Barry, but--

629
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:02,963
After the last time?

630
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,673
After last time, l didn't even
want to get near her front door.

631
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:06,675
''You kids
get out of my front yard...

632
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,010
''or l'm calling the police!''

633
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,637
-You want sparkles?
-Hell, no.

634
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,264
You don't want sparkles?

635
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:15,475
l want sparkles, Darb.
You can do my toes.

636
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,644
OK. When l'm done with hers.

637
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:18,896
Don't rush her.

638
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,442
You're getting better, Darb.

639
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:39,208
This woman and this man,
they was married.

640
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:44,171
Was real good friends
until another woman came along.

641
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,590
Now they're lesbians.

642
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:49,259
Disgusting--two women
biting at each other...

643
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:51,011
if you get my drift.

644
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,846
l think that--that's nasty.

645
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,724
Man, l get the chills.

646
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,809
l'm a party boy.

647
00:41:57,851 --> 00:41:59,311
Not only that...

648
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:02,689
you'll be--be pickin' up
women in your pickup, man.

649
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:05,567
Yeah. My pickup, man. Yeah.

650
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,694
That's the way l am.

651
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,572
Turn fifteen, l'm partyin'.

652
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,369
Without wood,
there'd be no America.

653
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,455
No ships to bring the pilgrims
across the ocean.

654
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:22,417
No log cabins,
no schoolhouses...

655
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,712
no churches,
no covered wagons...

656
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:28,715
no railroad ties...

657
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,968
no cigar store indians...

658
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,427
no nothin'.

659
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,031
Solomon, are you down there?

660
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:39,495
What are you doing
lifting weights?

661
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:42,080
-l'm lifting.
-You'll stunt your growth.

662
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,749
You're gonna get
peg leg shoulders...

663
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,751
and pinched neck nerves.

664
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,836
lt's not good to lift
while you're growing.

665
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,463
l can see your shoulder
popping out.

666
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,465
Look at the way
it raises and gets smaller...

667
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,300
raises and gets smaller.

668
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,887
You're gonna pop out a joint.
That's not healthy.

669
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,847
Look at it. lt's gonna pop.

670
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,984
Your dad's old taps.

671
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,486
He used to be good.

672
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,907
He said he was blessed
with the gift of tap.

673
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:19,243
Took up tapping
when he got his bald spot.

674
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:21,954
He wanted to get transplants...

675
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:24,122
but l thought
that was a bit drastic.

676
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:28,210
Told him if he wanted to,
he should take up tap.

677
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,255
He put up the mirror.

678
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,801
He said if Marlene Dietrich
could see him dance...

679
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:37,386
she would fall in love.

680
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,805
What do you want
with Marlene Dietrich?

681
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,517
She had her bottom ribs
surgically removed...

682
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,311
so she'd have
more of an hourglass figure.

683
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,230
Don't you know stars are flawed?

684
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,572
Will you smile?

685
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,866
Come on, l want a smile.

686
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,242
Tuck in that tummy.

687
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:01,743
One smile. Come on.

688
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,912
l'm gonna tickle you
till you smile.

689
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:05,414
Flatten that tummy.

690
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,291
Hold your shoulders in.

691
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,253
Do you miss your dad? l do.

692
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,547
Come on, hold that tummy in.

693
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:15,716
Come on,
can you smile for me, please?

694
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,345
OK, you son of a bitch...

695
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,890
if you don't smile,
l'm gonna kill you, OK?

696
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:25,434
l've killed before,
and l will kill again.

697
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:29,146
l will pick up your brains
all over the floor.

698
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:30,647
You came out of my womb...

699
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,774
and l'll stick you
right back in my womb.

700
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,944
lf you don't smile,
l'm going to kill you.

701
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:55,172
Yeah, party.

702
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,008
Break dance.

703
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,903
l have a good personality.

704
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:21,824
l have blond hair, blue eyes.

705
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:25,619
l'm a hundred
and thirty-five pounds...

706
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:28,664
and l'm 4' 10 1/2.

707
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,791
l have very light skin.

708
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:35,170
l am considered
what you would call an albino.

709
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:39,466
l like men
that are very sensitive...

710
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:44,805
that will sit down and watch
a good movie with me...

711
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,723
won't hit on me...

712
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,392
will love me for me.

713
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:53,814
l like men that either have
blond hair, blue eyes...

714
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:55,691
or...

715
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:57,776
black or brown hair.

716
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:01,196
Actually, the eyes,
it really doesn't matter.

717
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,699
My favorite movie stars are...

718
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,870
Pamela Anderson
and Patrick Swayze.

719
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,497
Patrick Swayze is sexy.

720
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,124
He's good-lookin'.

721
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,042
l love that man to death.

722
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,590
l would pay money to touch him.

723
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,342
When l was born...

724
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:26,138
l was born without any toes
on my feet at all.

725
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,141
l would pick things up
with the balls of my feet...

726
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,851
instead of my toes.

727
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:34,229
l had trouble
walking on my feet.

728
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:50,621
Clifford Dumkin
is the fat cocaine addict...

729
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:53,332
who lives down by my house.

730
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:57,419
He's into wife-swapping
and sex parties.

731
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,381
He gives girls cocaine,
and he fucks them...

732
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,426
in front of different kids
in the neighborhood.

733
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:06,595
Every time l see him...

734
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,431
he's got cocaine
all over his mustache.

735
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,981
-Watch her eyes.
-l want a mustache, damn it!

736
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:20,067
-Get her underbelly.
-Her underbooty.

737
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,488
-Get her nipples.
-l want a mustache!

738
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,697
lt's OK, Foot Foot.

739
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,075
l want to look like
Burt Reynolds!

740
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:35,457
l want a mustache, damn it!

741
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,170
Oh, baby, it's OK.

742
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,968
-Gotta calm down.
-l want a mustache, damn it!

743
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,463
Get down!

744
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,057
No! Get down now!

745
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,537
Do you still miss her?

746
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,874
Yeah. There's not a day goes by
that l don't miss her.

747
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,545
Sure seems that way sometimes.

748
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:06,632
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

749
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,719
Do you think
she looked a little like me?

750
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,763
Yeah, she looked
a little bit like you.

751
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,892
She's in heaven now.

752
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:18,602
Yeah, she's in heaven now.

753
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,565
What was she like?

754
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,361
Oh, she's--Brown hair.

755
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:30,239
She drinked, you know,
a little bit...

756
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,366
but she was a good person.

757
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:36,078
She was real nice, she was.

758
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:38,121
When l was a kid,
l remember growin' up.

759
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:40,707
There was this man
that raised me.

760
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,585
His wife walked around
in her underclothes...

761
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:46,505
and he'd always tell us...

762
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:47,923
all us boys
that worked for him--

763
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:49,341
you know, when you'd come in...

764
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,176
she'd be walking around
getting ready for work--

765
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,554
told us not to bug her.

766
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:56,056
They always warned us,
you know, don't--

767
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:58,725
you can look, but don't touch.

768
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:00,644
lt was hard to do...

769
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:02,813
when there was something
tempting in front of you...

770
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:06,024
as pretty and good-lookin'
as she was...

771
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,860
you know and everything.

772
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:10,904
But you got to respect
somebody else's wife...

773
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:12,531
in other words.

774
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:28,380
His dad never gave a crap.

775
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,508
Not even at the end of his game.

776
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:35,304
lt was scary to see him
despondent like that.

777
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,725
His dad didn't care
for mom much, either...

778
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,268
or the little doggie.

779
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,021
He started going to church...

780
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,816
and he started listening
to the gospels.

781
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:52,279
lt was expected
when he robbed the neighbors.

782
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,780
He took their wine...

783
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:56,700
and he took
some rings and fine jewelry.

784
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,620
l think he got a fur coat
as well.

785
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,748
When he had a kid...

786
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,751
he didn't think
to watch his ways.

787
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,461
He felt the same as his daddy.

788
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,009
Come on, put it back up.

789
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:16,136
-Let's go!
-Come on, man!

790
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:18,764
Go! Go, God damn it!

791
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:20,807
-Fuckin' get it!
-Put it up!

792
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,187
-Let's go.
-Tell me when you're ready.

793
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,897
Get that motherfucker.

794
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:29,483
On your marks, set, go.

795
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,527
Get him, God damn it, go!

796
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,570
Fuck him up, Tummy!

797
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:36,240
Get it, boy! Get it, goddamn!

798
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,325
Don't be afeared!

799
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:47,042
-Got beat, didn't ya?
-Hell, yeah!

800
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:48,377
Shit!

801
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,548
Don't you know it's a sin
to get beat by your son?

802
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:54,424
Shoop, shoop, shoop

803
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:56,510
He got beat, he got beat

804
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:58,846
He got beat by his own son

805
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:00,639
He got beat, he got beat

806
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:02,891
He got beat by his own son

807
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:04,434
He got beat, he got beat

808
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:06,145
He got beat by Tummy

809
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,814
He got beat,
he got beat by mummy

810
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:26,290
-Who's next?
-Who's next?

811
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:27,541
How about the girls?

812
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,879
You two wrestle--
have an arm wrestle.

813
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:36,466
-Come on. Get it goin'.
-Get it on!

814
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:42,222
Let's see what we got.
You sit there and there.

815
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:43,682
All right, let's see it.

816
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,561
Do they even know
how to arm wrestle?

817
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,813
Now, are you guys ready?
You guys ready?

818
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:51,231
On your mark--

819
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:54,610
No holdin' the table.

820
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:56,737
Hand up in the air.

821
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,739
Get steady...

822
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,616
-Are you ready?
-No, not really.

823
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,743
You ready?

824
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,161
-Ready.
-You ready?

825
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,914
Go!

826
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:09,750
-Come on!
-Come on!

827
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:13,795
Go, God damn it! Yeah!

828
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,005
There.

829
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:21,803
God! Get beat like that,
that's awful.

830
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:23,388
lt's all right.
lt's all right.

831
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,474
-l take pride--
-l tried.

832
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:28,519
She did her bit. She tried.

833
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,145
You gave it all.

834
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:31,980
Any more fucking beer?

835
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,524
-That's it.
-Fuck.

836
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,400
Man, fuck all this bullshit.

837
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,945
l can piss in this bottle,
fill it back up.

838
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,988
-Fuck that.
-Have to go for a beer run.

839
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:46,036
-Who's next?
-The big man, little man!

840
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:48,205
Let's get it. Come on.

841
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,082
That's what l want to see.

842
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:51,667
Let's go, buddy.

843
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,878
Show him what you got, man.
Fuck him up.

844
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,256
-Come on!
-Ready?

845
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:58,507
Go!

846
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:00,551
Come on! Get it! Get it!

847
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,761
-Go! Go!
-Come on!

848
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:05,597
You got it! Come on! Get him !

849
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,976
Fuck this shit!

850
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:11,353
Damn!

851
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,399
Fuck this shit, man!

852
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:20,320
Did the little man get you,
buddy?

853
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:23,031
-Motherfucker.
-You should be ashamed.

854
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:25,659
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

855
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:28,453
Loser.

856
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,747
You can lose with pride,
though, man, shit.

857
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:36,879
Little fuck
can break our assholes anyway.

858
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,047
Not true, motherfucker.

859
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:48,724
Aren't you a little girly
from Salt Lake City?

860
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,894
Two-quart legs
and two rubber titties.

861
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:54,313
Two-quart legs
and two rubber titties...

862
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,440
She loves electricity,
but she burns off gas.

863
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:59,234
Got a V-8 pussy
and a cadillac ass.

864
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:05,407
That little girl
from Salt Lake City...

865
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,576
two-quart legs
and two rubber titties.

866
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:09,453
Loves electricity,
but she burns off gas.

867
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,955
Got a V-8 pussy
and a cadillac ass.

868
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,883
Get in there!

869
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:25,260
Don't let him get on you, man!

870
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,721
Get him out! Come on!

871
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,850
Come on, man, get him down!

872
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:37,731
Fuck him up! Come on!

873
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:39,608
Get him !

874
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,569
Come on! Don't let him
fuck with you like that!

875
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,447
He ain't got no damn business
fucking with you.

876
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:48,617
-Goddamn!
-Kill him !

877
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:51,411
Break him down!

878
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,622
Get him down and beat
the fucking hell out of him !

879
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,207
-Come on!
-Stomp his head!

880
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,961
-Stomp his ass!
-Hit him one more time.

881
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:04,091
-Fuck him up.
-Get him !

882
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,145
There you go!

883
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:19,148
Goddamn,
dig his fucking grave, man!

884
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,357
Come on!

885
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:26,446
Teach that motherfucker.

886
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,283
There you go!

887
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,244
Hit him in the head!

888
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,495
Smash his brains!

889
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,124
Look at that.

890
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:45,424
-Ain't no ambulance.
-Oh, well.

891
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:46,633
Spit on him.

892
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,345
Life's a bitch,
and then you die.

893
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:51,680
There you go.

894
00:58:56,787 --> 00:58:58,121
lt's a cat trap.

895
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:02,543
l want it high.

896
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,804
The doctor said they're
gonna have to take off...

897
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,473
one of my boobies...

898
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:43,185
and l know what happens
when they do that.

899
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:46,730
Boys'll stop looking at me...

900
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:52,110
and once,
when l finally meet a guy...

901
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:55,155
that likes me,
and he sees my scar...

902
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,368
he'll just stop talking to me
for no reason.

903
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:03,664
Boys are like that.

904
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:10,671
Dear world...

905
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:14,716
l have confusion around me in
every direction from my brain.

906
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:19,346
l've tried and tried to make it
here in this fucking world...

907
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:22,474
but l think it was a mistake
that l was ever born.

908
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:25,602
l do not feel guilty
about taking my own life.

909
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:28,272
l've tried your ways.

910
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:32,901
l've had a job
since l was thirteen years old.

911
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:36,697
Making a living
was never a real problem for me.

912
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:42,244
The problem was all l see
is misery and darkness.

913
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:44,329
Die, die, die.

914
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:46,290
l'll put a gun
to my fucking head right now.

915
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,391
l'm so pissed l could kill you,
but l'm not going to.

916
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,770
Life is beautiful.

917
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,772
Really it is.

918
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:13,358
Full of beauty and illusions.

919
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:15,944
Life is great.

920
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:19,114
Without it, you'd be dead.

921
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:20,866
l think one of the reasons
she didn't struggle so much...

922
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:22,534
is l said,
''You're a black witch.

923
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:23,952
''We're giving you
the greatest honor...

924
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:27,456
''to sit at the right hand
of Arioch in hell.''

925
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:06,870
Jarrod ain't here.

926
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,363
Go like that.

927
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,219
He's got a gay one.

928
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,762
Come on.

929
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:57,499
ls she dead?

930
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,383
She's alive on that machine.

931
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,345
She stinks.

932
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:17,519
Her life is over.

933
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,731
She smells like baked ham.

934
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,986
Bet she could live like this
forever.

935
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,365
Do you think
she'll ever wake up?

936
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,702
Hell, no.

937
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:34,870
She's dead as hell.

938
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,749
Go over and shoot her
in the foot.

939
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,377
Why?

940
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:46,131
Try and wake her up.
Shoot her in the foot.

941
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,282
l told you she's dead.

942
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,581
Could live forever
on one of these gadgets.

943
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:30,175
She'll be dead now.

944
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,770
She's always been dead.

945
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:46,942
She's been gone a long time.

946
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:50,487
She sure stinks.

947
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:03,083
French fries, sittin' on a bench

948
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:07,087
May l, want l, fifteen cents

949
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:09,298
You miss, you miss

950
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:11,008
You miss like this

951
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:19,641
This is my baby...

952
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,185
and l breast-feed it.

953
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,366
l'm its mother.

954
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:41,663
l...

955
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:43,499
l love my babies.

956
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:50,923
l love...

957
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:53,008
to handle babies...

958
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,968
because l love my babies.

959
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,430
And l kiss them on their head--

960
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,183
on their bald head.

961
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,812
And l rub its head.

962
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,313
l love it...

963
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,857
and l hug it...

964
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,984
then l kiss it, then l rub it.

965
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,322
l rub its head.

966
01:09:16,573 --> 01:09:20,536
Sometimes, though,
l do something. l do it.

967
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:23,789
My mom tells me, ''Do something,''
then l do it.

968
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,499
And l do it and do it.

969
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,753
l clean house.
l sweep the floor.

970
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,839
''Get in there
and mop that floor up.''

971
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,550
l get in here
and mop the floor up.

972
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,678
Whether it's water
or whether it's not water...

973
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:38,971
l clean it up.

974
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,724
And then when l cleaned it up...

975
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:49,273
l had it all straightened up,
even my dolls and all--

976
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:51,441
straightened up.

977
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:54,361
Now l always keep my toys...

978
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:56,822
because l take care of them.

979
01:09:56,864 --> 01:10:02,244
And l always do, and l always do
take care of them.

980
01:10:02,244 --> 01:10:05,164
And then,
when l went to a store...

981
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:09,334
l came back, and l got
in a hurry behind the car...

982
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:14,089
and l broke
a--a spaghetti sauce.

983
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:16,717
And when l did,
l got in trouble for it.

984
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:21,430
And then, l didn't break it...

985
01:10:21,472 --> 01:10:24,057
but this always happens.

986
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:27,936
And then l turned around
and looked...

987
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:32,316
and l said, ''Laurel,
you going to have to pray.

988
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:35,110
''No, you got to pray.''

989
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:39,114
And she said, ''Pray about what?''

990
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:41,533
And l said,
''You going to have to pray.''

991
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,744
You do have to pray...

992
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:45,370
white or black or whatever.

993
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:46,580
Some people came by here.

994
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:49,625
We're going to have
a lot of people here today.

995
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:53,962
So we had to get up
this morning...

996
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,172
and we did.

997
01:10:58,675 --> 01:10:59,843
Here it goes.

998
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:09,394
Ooh, boy. l'm getting that stuff
in my hair.

999
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,527
Well, well, well.

1006
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:43,298

01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,508
Well, if you see it,

1008
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,968
-We live right over here.
-All right.

1009
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:48,011

All right.

1025
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:06,215
Those people are deaf.

1026
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:09,051
l'll bet she's cussing him out.

1027
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,514
You want mayonnaise, Darb?

1028
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:14,765

He was on that television series
called ''Chico and the Man.''

1032
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:36,954
Did you ever hear of that?

1033
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:41,208
He was an actor.

1034
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,376
What do you do?

1035
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,713
l'm a gossip writer
for a newspaper.

1036
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:49,758
-Gossip?
-You know gossip?

1037
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:54,638

How much further is it

1049
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:47,649
lt's right nearby here.
lt's right around here.

1050

Where?

1051

Well, l'm not sure exactly,
but is there a map?

1052
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:53,655
There's a map in the glove box
or here somewhere.

1053
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,324
Maybe it's under the seat

1054
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:57,159
Let me...let me see

-How much?
-A dollar.

Just selling candy,
getting money...

1101
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,066
and making the greenbacks.

1102
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:23,986
l was all right

1103
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,321
For awhile

1104
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:28,240
l could smile

1105
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:31,243
For awhile

1106
01:22:31,285 --> 01:22:33,453
But l saw you last night

1107
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:36,123
You held my hand so tight

1108
01:22:36,165 --> 01:22:37,666
As you stopped

1109
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:41,086
To say hello

1110
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:43,881
Oh, you wished me well

1111
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:47,217
You couldn't tell

1112
01:22:47,259 --> 01:22:49,052
That l'd been

1113
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,472
Crying

1114
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:53,891
Over you

1115
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:56,185
Crying

1116

Over you

1117
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:00,481
And you

1118
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:02,983

All alone

1121
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:10,949
Alone and crying

1122
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,410
Crying

1123
01:23:13,452 --> 01:23:15,871
Crying

1124
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,122
Crying

1125
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:22,544
lt's hard to understand

1126
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:24,963
But the touch

1127
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:27,007
Of your hand

1128
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:29,593
Can start me crying

1129
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,556
l thought that l

1130
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:37,309
Was over you

1131
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:40,020
But it's true

1132
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:41,980
So true

1133
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:44,733
l love you even more

1134
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:47,528
Than l did before

1135
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:52,199
But, darling, what can l do?

1136
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:54,660
For you don't

1137
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:57,079
Love me

1138
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,501
And l'll always be

1139
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:05,045
Crying

1140
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:07,631
Over you

1141
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:10,217
Crying

1142
01:24:10,259 --> 01:24:12,719
Over you

1143
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:14,638
Yes

1144
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,432
Now you're gone

1145
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:22,020
And from this moment on

1146
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:25,274
l'll be crying

1147
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:27,776
Crying

1148
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:30,362
Crying

1149
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,531
Crying

1150
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:38,162
Yeah, crying

1151
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:43,375
Crying

1152
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:48,505
Over

1153
01:24:48,547 --> 01:24:53,969
You

1154
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,477
Yes, Jesus loves me

1155
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:13,447
For the bible tells me so

1156
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,996
Dial it now. lt's a bad dime.
