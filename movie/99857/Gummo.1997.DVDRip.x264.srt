1
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:14,518
Peanut, peanut,
peanut butter, motherfucker

2
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,492
Tune in, dick,
you mess around with me

3
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,118
You'll get your ass kicked

4
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,808
'Cause you're a big motherfucker

5
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:26,587
Gary has a pussy and

6
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,395
James has a pussy and

7
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,534
James has a pussy

8
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:35,606
And Mommy has a pussy

9
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:41,558
And Aunt Lil
has a little, tiny pussy

10
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:43,255
Xenia, Ohio.

11
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,337
A few years ago...

12
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:52,275
a tornado hit this place.

13
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:01,429
It killed the people,
left and right.

14
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:04,817
Dogs died. Cats died.

15
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,486
Houses were split open...

16
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,940
and you could see necklaces
hanging from branches of trees.

17
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,190
People's legs and neck bones
were sticking out.

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,319
Oliver found a leg on his roof.

19
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,528
A lot of people's fathers
died...

20
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:24,248
and were killed
by the great tornado.

21
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,285
I saw a girl
fly through the sky...

22
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:29,212
and I looked up her skirt.

23
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:32,628
Her skull was smashed.
And some kids died.

24
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:35,418
My neighbor was killed
in that house.

25
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:38,355
He used to ride dirt bikes
and three-wheelers.

26
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:40,917
They never found his head.

27
00:01:40,957 --> 00:01:42,713
I always thought that was funny.

28
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:49,020
People died in Xenia.

29
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,764
Before dad died...

30
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,666
he had a bad case
of the diabetes.

31
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:12,763
I love my little rooster,
and my rooster loves me

32
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:15,994
Gonna cherish that chicken
'neath a green bay tree

33
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:18,168
Little rooster go

34
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,863
Cock-a-doodle-doo

35
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:22,421
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

36
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,689
And I love my little hen,
and my hen, she loves me

37

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,675
Little hen goes cluck cluck

00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,342
Little rooster goes

40
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:34,104
Cock-a-doodle-doo

41
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,075
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

42
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,116
And I love my little pig hog,
and my hoggy loves me

43
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:43,572
I'm gonna cherish that hog
'neath a green bay tree

44
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:46,712
Little hog goes mm-mm,
little hen goes cluck cluck

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,636
Little rooster goes

46
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,098
Cock-a-doodle-doo

47
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,955
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

48
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,305
And I love my little duckling,
my duckling loves me

49
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,797
I'll cherish my duck
'neath a green bay tree

50
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:03,153
Little duck goes quack quack,
little hen goes cluck cluck

51
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,269
Little pig goes mm-mm

52
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,803
Little rooster goes

53
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:08,470
Cock-a-doodle-doo

54
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:11,127
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

55
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:14,742
And I love my little guinea,
and my guinea loves me

56
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:18,043
Gonna cherish my guinea
'neath a green bay tree

57
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:21,426
Little guin' goes pot-er-rak,

00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,730
Little pig goes mm-mm,
little hen goes cluck cluck

59
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,171
Little rooster goes

60
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,830
Cock-a-doodle-doo

61
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:30,836
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

62
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:34,138
And I love my little dog,
and my doggy loves me

63
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,402
I'm gonna cherish that dog
'neath a green bay tree

64
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,851
Little dog goes bowwow,

65
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:43,959
Little pig goes mm-mm,
little duck goes quack quack

66
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,037
Little guinea, pot-er-rak

67
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:47,320
But my rooster goes

68
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,266
Cock-a-doodle-doo

69
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:53,018
Doodle-doo doodle-doo

70
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:16,983
Spit it out.

71
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,530
You have a lump in your titty.

72
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:11,701
What?

73
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:14,267
You have a big old lump.

74
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,273
Tummler sees everything.

75
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,251
Some say he's downright evil.

76
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:42,075
He's got what it takes
to be a legend.

77
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,083
He's got a marvelous persona.

78
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,570
You got this one?

79
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,531
Don't kill the bitch.
It's a house cat.

80
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,397
It's a lesbian cat.

81
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,212
You can tell.

82
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:02,357
Looks like my mom.

83
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:09,980
Know what I'm doing tomorrow?

84
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,092
What?

85
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,238
Going to an insane asylum.

86
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,903
Insane asylum?

87
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,396
Gonna get me a raving beauty.

88
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:20,086
Foot Foot, where you been?

89
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,345
You smell like a dookie, girl.

90
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,905
Talk to him in school?

91
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,755
I don't know. Some hall.

92
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,698
He smiled.

93
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,234
Don't be such a puss.

94
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:51,665
I try not to. I'm shy.

95
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,344
Foot Foot, you stink a bitch.
Where'd you find her?

96
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,228
On the porch sleeping
for three hours.

97
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,951
How'd she get out there?

98
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,501
- You left the window cracked.
- No.

99
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,672
- You did.
- It was not me.

100
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,886
You know
it's always Darby's fault.

101
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,419
She's looking
a little impregnated.

102
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:11,802
- No.
- She is.

103
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:14,073
Let's flip her over
and look at her bottom part.

104
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,548
Let me look at you, Foot Foot.

105
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,074
Is it red?

106
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,578
It's not any red, no.

107
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,922
- Is it swollen?
- No.

108
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:27,739
An impregnated cat is a bitch.
Like, this cat's pregnant.

109
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,812
Yeah. It's true.

110
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,892
- No, she's not a bitch.
- She is, too.

111
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,820
She's gotten herself
in trouble like this.

112
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,089
- She still has nine nips.
- Nine nips?

113
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,783
Nine lives, too.

114
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,406
If she is pregnant, we'll drown
the kittens in the creek.

115
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,748
You see? Do it like this.

116
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,578
Get it over all the pink...
around it.

117
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:49,173
Do it on it real tight.

118
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,641
That tight,
it will get infected.

119
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:54,011
Don't tell me.
This is the right way.

120
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:56,183
If you just do little pats,
it won't raise it.

121
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,482
The whole point is to make it
fatter and pop it out bigger.

122
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,851
- Tight.
- That's tight.

123
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,575
- This gonna hurt?
- It's not gonna hurt.

124
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:05,369
We're gonna do it quick.

125
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,957
- Ready?
- Pull it, Dot, pull it!

126
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:11,030
One, two, three.

127
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,017
They look bigger.

128
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,354
They look a little bigger.
I think they look wider.

129
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:22,038
The nipple's fatter.

130
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:26,230
They look redder, but I think
they look much better.

131
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:27,675
Better nipple.

132
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,083
Every day

133
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,059
It's a-gettin' closer

134
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:34,297
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

135
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,275
Love like yours will

136
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:38,805
Surely come my way

137
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,082
A-hey a-hey-hey

138
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,808
Every day

139
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,502
It's a-getting closer

140
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,054
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

141
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,068
Love like yours will

142
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,476
Surely come my way

143
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,516
A-hey a-hey-hey

144
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:57,557
Every day, It's a-gettin' closer

145
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,346
Goin' faster
than a roller coaster

146
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,348
Love like yours
will surely come my way

147
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,014
Hey-hey hey-hey-hey

148
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:07,736
Love like yours

149
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,772
Will surely come my way

150
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,250
What do you want to do?

151
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:28,443
Wanna keep lookin'?

152
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,002
Go by Dean's place...

153
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,474
back by the dumpsters?

154
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,187
Then let's go get our money.

155
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,507
Let's get some milkshakes.

156
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,207
Milkshakes?

157
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,033
Strawberry milkshake.

158
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:50,265
If they don't have strawberry,
I'll get pineapple.

159
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,009
Let's go get our money first.

160
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,988
Does your mom
ever make you food?

161
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,844
- She makes me toast.
- Is that it?

162
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:05,298
She cooks me lamb chops.

163
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,901
You ever eaten crepe suzette?

164
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,943
Spanker had gravy on his vest...

165
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,592
gravy on his tie,
gravy on his pants...

166
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,058
gravy all over him...

167
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:38,516
so he went to his grave
with gravy on his vest...

168
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,971
gravy on his tie,
gravy on his pants...

169
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:43,638
gravy all over him.

170
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,171
That dirty old man.

171
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:54,745
These two kids I know...

172
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,530
these two brothers...

173
00:11:57,565 --> 00:12:00,347
they murdered their parents.

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,090
They both claim to be raised
as Jehovah Witnesses.

175
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,042
They came to school
in really nice shorts...

176
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:13,241
and polished tennis sneakers...

177
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:18,394
and their shirts were always
collared with buttons...

178
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:21,724
and their hair
was always slicked back...

179
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:25,073
their teeth
were always brushed...

180
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:30,038
and their shirts and pants
were always ironed...

181
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,892
and their shoes
never were scuffed up...

182
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:35,445
or anything like that.

183
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:39,478
They seemed to have
a wonderful life.

184
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:42,419
I don't know what went wrong.

185
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,827
Why don't you give me
them shoes?

186
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,511
'Cause they're new,
and I don't give you new shoes.

187
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,654
Yeah, fuck that, man.

188
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:51,547
I'm keeping this shit
right here.

189
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,174
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

190
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,133
Pissant.

191
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:03,859
- Fuck him up.
- Get off me, man.

192
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,147
I told you
not to hit me in the face.

193
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,827
- What's up?
- Stop that.

194
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,019
Damn!

195
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,722
Shit. Go, fucker.

196
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:35,797
Let's go.

197
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,330
I'm gonna fuck you up.

198
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,676
Damn! Shit!

199
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,130
Hit a man while he's down.

200
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,928
Shit. All right, all right.

201
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,241
Oh, fuckin'...

202
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:59,644
Shit, man. Give me them shoes.

203
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,770
So, what's for dinner, man?
You cooking tonight?

204
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:07,196
I was about four years old
the first time...

205
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,051
and...

206
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:12,565
I remember one time he came home
from work real late...

207
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,230
and I had been sleeping
on the couch...

208
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:17,083
and he came in,
and he woke me up...

209
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,939
and he laid on top of me...

210
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,842
and he told me, he said,
"Take off your panties."

211
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,859
And I asked him why.

212
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:26,356
He said
that he was only playing...

213
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,284
and that
he wasn't gonna hurt me...

214
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,382
and he was gonna
make me feel good.

215
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:34,170
And I took off my panties,
and then...

216
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:36,343
he got on top of me...

217
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:41,912
and he was rubbin' and touchin'
and feelin' and laughin'.

218
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,410
And then... and then...

219
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:46,322
he'd wake up in the morning,
and he'd come in my bedroom...

220
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:47,771
or bring me into his bedroom...

221
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:51,100
and he would kiss me
and touch me and...

222
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,337
and make me play with him and...

223
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:56,123
And, you know, at first,
I was real scared.

224
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,366
I didn't know if it was right...

225
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:00,721
but he would tell me
that we were having fun...

226
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:03,514
and what we were doing
wasn't wrong...

227
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,141
because he was my dad.

228
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:19,668
You guys didn't get very many
this time.

229
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,043
Yeah. It's a scarce count.

230
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:25,043
Let's see.
Twelve, twelve and a half.

231
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:26,426
I'll give you thirteen.

232
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,611
It's gettin' crazy, 'cause
things are startin' to thin out.

233
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,015
You know you guys
got some competition out there?

234
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,995
- What? Who?
- Jarrod.

235
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,281
- Who?
- Jarrod Wiggley.

236
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,778
You know the kid
that lives over by the school?

237
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,057
The one who takes care
of his grandmother?

238
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,613
I know that kid. He used to have
a sister in my class...

239
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:47,896
but she moved.

240
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:51,195
Her name was June Wiggley.
We used to call her June bug.

241
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:52,755
And I noticed something else.

242
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:54,771
The cats that's usually
out by the garbage cans...

243
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:56,242
they're not around any more.

244
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:57,494
And the Chinese restaurant...

245
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,321
you know the one
that buys all my stuff?

246
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,429
The guy that owns it
had a heart attack and died...

247
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,324
so I guess they're getting ready
to go out of business.

248
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:05,363
I'm pretty smart,
if I say so myself.

249
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,714
Why is that?

250
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:11,287
This afternoon,
we walked into a fruit store...

251
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:14,325
and the clerk thought
I was some out-of-town hick.

252
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:17,234
"Those apples will be
two bucks each, " he tells me.

253
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,343
That's where I outsmarted him.
I hand over a five...

254
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,649
And as he's about to give me
a dollar change, I say...

255
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,408
"Keep it. We're even."

256
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:27,128
"On the way in,
I stepped on a grape."

257
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,106
You want this
by the cat or by the pound?

258
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,294
Don't matter.

259
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,089
I'll give you
a dollar a pound, then.

260
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,132
Hey...

261
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,765
could you hook me up
with some glue?

262
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:41,233
What kind you want?

263
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,065
Not wood glue.

264
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,370
Not cement glue, either.

265
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,438
Do you have butcher's
model glue, in tins?

266
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,647
Yeah. I'm gonna go get it, man.

267
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:53,498
Who was it?
Who killed that little baby cat?

268
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,256
- Joseph.
- Was it?

269
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:57,813
Yeah. It was ate up
with maggots, though.

270
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:00,602
They had to kill it.
They're just strays.

271
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:03,320
All these cats around here
have twenty babies.

272
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,179
Little bitty old black cat.
He wasn't about this long.

273
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,733
We was trying to figure out
how to make it stay away.

274
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,162
Couldn't do it. He said,
"Give me a bottle of gasoline."

275
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:13,401
He opened its mouth up
and poured it full of gasoline.

276
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:16,371
Get that son of a bitch. I ain't
never seen that cat since.

277
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,901
Lit it. Poured gas down it.

278
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,169
Poured gas down it, man,
and lit it.

279
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:23,666
I ain't never killed nothin'...

280
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:28,536
just to be killing it,
besides that cat.

281
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,093
He lit a cat on fire
for six hours.

282
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,955
Boom! Boom!

283
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:36,185
No, I seen somebody put one
in a microwave.

284
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,075
That motherfucker melted.

285
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,891
They got me for a damn BB gun.

286
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,550
You shouldn't have pulled it
on that girl.

287
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:46,166
I didn't pull it on that girl.
You're crazy!

288
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:49,074
You're crazy, man.
You're crazy, man.

289
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:50,578
I didn't pull that BB gun out.

290
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,140
When I went to jail, they put us
in the old juvenile...

291
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,839
because the jails were so full.

292
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,218
It was one little room...

293
00:17:56,253 --> 00:18:00,082
with a big old silver hard bed
on a brick wall.

294
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:03,419
There was eighty-five people
in the same cell with us.

295
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:06,322
Worst thing I hate about it
was them niggers down there.

296
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,015
I... God, boy, hey...

297
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,573
They make me so mad, I just want
to tear their head off.

298
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:13,139
I hate the motherfuckers.

299
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:17,849
I just don't like 'em.

300
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:20,983
You got them all. If you
hit one, you get them all.

301
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,809
They have ten
to every one of you.

302
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,562
- They ain't gonna fight fair.
- Unless you got nigger buddies.

303
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:29,393
That's it. If you got
some good Latin buddies...

304
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:32,502
I had some good... some good
nigger friends at Pearl.

305
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:23,996
Solomon...

306
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,298
did your mom find a new house?

307
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,530
I saw a house yesterday...

308
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,882
near my house.

309
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:37,457
I think it was this lady's.

310
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:42,168
I saw a sign, "for sale."

311
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:45,139
It had a bullet hole
in the mailbox.

312
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,741
A hole?

313
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,307
A big old hole.

314
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,802
I think my brother shot it down
when I was younger.

315
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,482
I think it was him.

316
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,313
He always used to say...

317
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,545
Roy Orbison
liked to shoot at things.

318
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:06,897
Roy always wore
these dark sunglasses.

319
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,250
My brother always wore
the same kind of sunglasses.

320
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,910
He sang that song "Crying."
You know that song?

321
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,443
What?

322
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,426
That song "Crying."

323
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,727
Cryin'

324
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,423
Over you

325
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,787
Cryin'

326
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,763
Over you

327
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,523
My brother
used to sing "Crying."

328
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,540
Where is he now?

329
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,693
My brother?

330
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:41,786
He's in the big city.

331
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,249
He took off in a bus.

332
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,524
He was a queer.

333
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:50,677
He's a queer now.

334
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,810
Your brother is?

335
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,355
Yeah. He dressed like ladies.

336
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:01,113
He wore skirts and lipsticks.

337
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:04,694
He wore stockings, eyeliner.

338
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:07,580
He even has boobs.

339
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:18,195
Girl?

340
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,341
Pretty much.

341
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,941
Was he pretty?

342
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:25,940
I don't know. I guess so.

343
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,922
I guess he was pretty.

344
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,275
Pretty enough
to have a boyfriend.

345
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,932
Cops
will frickin' catch your ass.

346
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:44,434
Fuck the cops!

347
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:47,346
I know, man.
Cops can kiss my ass.

348
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,937
All they are is assholes.

349
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,533
I know, man.
What's the matter with them?

350
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:55,322
They mad 'cause
we get more pussy than they do?

351
00:21:58,493 --> 00:22:01,754
Damn you, rabbit!
You smell like fuckin' piss!

352
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,893
You can kiss my ass!

353
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:07,955
I hate the goddamned rabbit.

354
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:10,364
Fuckin' rabbit!

355
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,771
Kill his ass!

356
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:16,476
I don't like rabbits
comin' to my fuckin' house.

357
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,069
I kill them.

358
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,133
I got 'im.

359
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:24,889
- No, you didn't!
- Yes, I did!

360
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:27,827
He looks like a queer rabbit!
All queer!

361
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:31,513
That fag! He can kiss my ass!

362
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:33,915
Rabbits are queers!

363
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:37,658
They always got to shit
on themselves!

364
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:41,271
Those little queer-ass rabbits.

365
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:44,472
Hey, look at these little fag
bunny ears.

366
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:47,542
Fuckin' rabbit.
I'm sick and tired of it.

367
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,330
- This shitty-ass rabbit stinks!
- I know.

368
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:52,601
He smells like pussy!

369
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,546
He smells like an asshole!

370
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,628
Hey, motherfucker!

371
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,741
Smells like wetback dick!

372
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,708
They smell like
a pound of bullshit!

373
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,486
Is it dead?

374
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,663
I don't know,
but I'm gonna make sure.

375
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:16,730
- I wonder if he's dead.
- Got some big-ass nostrils.

376
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:20,507
Hate fuckin' rabbits.

377
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,666
I wonder if he's got any money.

378
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,610
Check his pockets.

379
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,016
Don't even got
that much meat on him.

380
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:44,949
Got too much grease on my gun.

381
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:48,308
- That rabbit can kiss my ass.
- Come on, let's go, man.

382
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:52,924
Who gives a shit about rabbits?

383
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:59,898
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

384
00:23:59,932 --> 00:24:02,518
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

385
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:04,945
Q, R, S, T, U, V

386
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:07,639
W, X, and Y and Z

387
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:10,327
Now I know my ABCs

388
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,699
Next time,
won't you sing with me?

389
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:15,253
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

390
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,681
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

391
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:20,180
Q, R, S, T, U, V

392
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:22,806
W, X, and Y and Z

393
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,465
- Ellen, how you doing?
- Hey.

394
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,962
What's up with you?

395
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,141
You good?

396
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,035
He got a haircut.

397
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:43,538
He looks pretty.

398
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,506
His thighs are getting stronger.

399
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:50,836
Eddie!

400
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,951
Hi, Dot. Hi, Helen.

401
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:58,876
My backhand really sucks.

402
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:00,981
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.

403
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,093
I think your playing
looks much better.

404
00:25:03,132 --> 00:25:04,921
I got second
in the tournament last week.

405
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:08,273
- Really?
- Yep. My serve got faster.

406
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:09,910
Increased by eight percent.

407
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:12,152
I can hit a ball
up to sixty-five miles an hour.

408
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:14,293
You got that way
from practicin'?

409
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,667
No. I got this thing
called A.D.D.

410
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,900
It's an attention disorder.

411
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,558
It affects the nervous system.

412
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,241
Makes it hard to concentrate.

413
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:27,065
Makes it hard?

414
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,239
Makes it hard, 'cause, like...

415
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,546
before I knew I had A.D.D...

416
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,922
I wouldn't really
go for the ball...

417
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,611
I wouldn't run the extra mile.

418
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,246
Yeah, but it's hard to explain.

419
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:43,994
I take ritalin,
this kind of prescription drug.

420
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:46,647
It's not like a drug
that fucks you up.

421
00:25:46,684 --> 00:25:49,172
If anything,
it makes you normal.

422
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,886
He just likes to go out
with skinny girls.

423
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,615
- How do you know?
- I just know.

424
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,765
Who told you?

425
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,463
His last girlfriend
used to be anorexic.

426
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,388
- Was she bulimic?
- I don't know.

427
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,111
I'll bet
she was a bulimic puker...

428
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:03,352
with white spots on her teeth.

429
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:06,171
I don't know. She used to run
track after school...

430
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:07,797
and this girl said,
"There goes Eddie's girl."

431
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,455
And I thought, "What for?
That girl's so skinny."

432
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,827
- They broke up, right?
- A while ago.

433
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,478
- Skin and bones.
- She was so skinny...

434
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,371
she had to wear rubber bands
around the tops of her socks...

435
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:19,379
and a belt around her spandex
bike shorts to keep them up.

436
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,395
No, she didn't.

437
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:23,379
Kids in school
used to laugh so hard.

438
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,275
Sure.

439
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:27,764
It's crazy, so crazy.

440
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,430
Guess I'm not skinny enough
for him, then.

441
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,291
- You are.
- No.

442
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,267
At least
if he goes out with you...

443
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:34,618
you'll know he got good taste.

444
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,908
We'll see.

445
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:40,567
We'll see if it happens,
is what we'll see.

446
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:47,252
I was born
right here in Xenia, Ohio...

447
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:50,107
to a lesbian midwife...

448
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,107
who cut all her hair
like a butch.

449
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:58,427
And when I was little,
she used to have stre...

450
00:26:58,461 --> 00:26:59,890
My mom
used to have stretch marks...

451
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,689
that went around in circles.

452
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:13,462
But I used to roll marbles
on her stomach...

453
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,118
my mom's stomach... and when
I would hit the navel...

454
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,645
she'd give me five dollars.

455
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:20,921
When I'd hit the navel,
she'd give me five dollars.

456
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:22,779
When I would hit
the side of her arm...

457
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,700
she would fuckin' hit me, man...

458
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:26,936
with a... a fuckin'...

459
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:29,112
a... a... a hairbrush...

460
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,636
or she would beat me...

461
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:35,353
I had a lesbian midwife
who gave birth to my mother...

462
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:38,105
while I was born
through my mother's womb.

463
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,700
My mother,
when she was thirty years old...

464
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,820
she entered menopause.

465
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,927
She sprouted a fuckin' mustache.
She lost her sex drive.

466
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:46,648
Everything in the house
started to change.

467
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:48,473
The way she would do the dishes
would change...

468
00:27:48,508 --> 00:27:50,679
or the way
she would clean the cabinets...

469
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:52,211
out of the house would change.

470
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,805
OK, so my sister,
she gets a complex.

471
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:59,035
She starts thinking, because
my mother has menopause...

472
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:02,330
at such an earlier...
at such an early age...

473
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:04,731
that she's gonna lose
all her sex drive...

474
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:07,994
and then her mustache is gonna
come out like my mom's mustache.

475
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,101
I can't shoot ball
like Michael Jordan can...

476
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,988
but that's all right, though,
you know?

477
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,829
I'm also gay.

478
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:24,184
Don't be nervous.

479
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,682
I ain't being nervous.

480
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:36,085
Now, there's something
special about you.

481
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,459
Something special I want.

482
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:39,921
Will you kiss me?

483
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:43,602
You're not gay.

484
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:52,858
It's all right.

485
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:59,962
My mother rejected me,
my father rejected me.

486
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,003
There was no love
in the household.

487
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:04,532
I was beaten, I was abused.

488
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:07,028
I had people stick shit
up my rectum.

489
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:09,010
Will you hug me? Just hug me.

490
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:10,962
- I'll give you a hug, man.
- Just hug me.

491
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,820
Seriously,
just calm down, just hug me.

492
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,608
Just give me some warmth.

493
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,620
Just hug.

494
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:22,449
Just hug me for a little bit,
because I'm so lonely.

495
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:25,013
I'm so... I've got no one.

496
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:29,147
There's no one left.
I've got no one left.

497
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,701
I've got no one to love me
any more.

498
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,293
I'll die here on this couch
with you.

499
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:42,580
My father worked the late shift
as a bathroom attendant.

500
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:46,679
My father was mugged
on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

501
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,626
For the rest of his days
on earth...

502
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:51,319
my father never celebrated
this holiday.

503
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:00,723
- With my sister.
- With your sister?

504
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,579
Wait till her husband finds out.

505
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:05,751
Oh, shit,
don't do nothing about it.

506
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:07,730
You'll come up dead,
laying in a ditch.

507
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,480
Yeah, you did, you liar.

508
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,404
No, I didn't. I never hit it.

509
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,087
Well, shoot,
you never know about that.

510
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:21,685
You Jarrod Wiggley?

511
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:24,945
You know Huntz?

512
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:28,251
He told me some stuff about you.

513
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,423
What did he say?

514
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,243
He said you'd been killing cats.

515
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:36,243
For, like, the past three weeks.

516
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,478
When do you go out?

517
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:41,906
Do it during the day usually?

518
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:44,437
No. I do it mostly at night.

519
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:46,931
You shoot 'em?

520
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,590
No. I put glass in tuna fish.

521
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:53,491
But mostly, I sprinkle poison
around the dumpsters...

522
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:54,994
like in the corners...

523
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:58,353
or around back
behind the church over there.

524
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:00,633
Huntz said
you take care of your granny.

525
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:03,286
Yeah. She's sick.

526
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:04,983
How old is she?

527
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,461
She's, like, I don't know,
probably ninety or ninety-one.

528
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,769
- Do you bathe her?
- Yeah.

529
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:15,001
I have to scrub her off
with a big sponge.

530
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:16,760
Do you have to change
her diaper?

531
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:20,571
Yeah. I hate that shit.
I hate all that shit.

532
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:22,132
Does she speak to herself?

533
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:26,515
No. She don't speak any more.
She's catatonic.

534
00:31:26,557 --> 00:31:29,339
She used to speak to herself.
She'd watch game shows...

535
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:32,536
and yell out
stuff to herself all the time.

536
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,711
She used to throw darts, right?

537
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,789
Yeah.
She used to have a dartboard.

538
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,833
So now you just take care
of your granny?

539
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,154
You kill cats, too?

540
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,789
I'm sick of everything.

541
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:53,051
I can't understand what the fuck
is wrong with people...

542
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,295
in this world.

543
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:58,588
They sit around. They don't know
what the fuck is going on.

544
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,693
- They're stupid.
- Fuck, they're ignorant.

545
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:05,205
They're... they're fuckers.
I fuckin' hate myself.

546
00:32:05,244 --> 00:32:07,797
They... they... they...

547
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:12,823
sit there in their pretend
little lives...

548
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,453
in their homes...

549
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,947
Hold on. Cassidey.

550
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,637
What's up, man?

551
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:27,546
- How you doin'?
- Good. You?

552
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,009
Yeah, good.

553
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:30,427
You guys ride your bikes
over here?

554
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:35,546
You bring me...
You brought my money?

555
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,304
- Yeah. Right here.
- Good.

556
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,031
Come on, let's go in the house.
Come on.

557
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:42,901
Man.

558
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:46,547
I got to tell you,
she had a migraine headache...

559
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,799
earlier today.

560
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:50,422
She almost wanted to call
the whole thing off, OK?

561
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,599
But I gave her...
I gave her some aspirin.

562
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,122
Cool. Hey, thanks a lot.

563
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,125
- I'm gonna go fuck her now.
- Wait. You want to fuck her?

564
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:05,014
Are you gonna fuck her, too?

565
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:07,286
All right, you got to hold on.

566
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:13,339
Hey, Cassidey.

567
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,129
Hey, put on that bathrobe thing.

568
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:19,126
Hey, put that on.

569
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,277
All right.

570
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,518
She's ready.

571
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:28,023
- You ready?
- Yeah.

572
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:30,713
OK, you got
to keep the light on.

573
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:31,861
All right.

574
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,382
You all right?

575
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,798
You good?

576
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:28,598
You ready?

577
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,152
All right, come on.

578
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:57,044
Hi, Solly.

579
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:58,808
Are you clean?

580
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:01,081
Did you use soap?

581
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:02,872
Let me smell your wrist.

582
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:07,898
Smells good.

583
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:11,065
- How does it smell like?
- Like fruit, like cherries.

584
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:13,686
My mom gives me cherry shampoo.

585
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,196
I like cherries.

586
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:21,498
I put cherries on my ice cream.

587
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:24,347
I like the name of cherry.
Cherries.

588
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:32,341
You got hands like a girl.

589
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,558
No, I don't.

590
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:37,010
Yes, you do.

591
00:35:42,396 --> 00:35:44,251
Can I read your fortune?

592
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:50,771
This big line says
you're gonna be a millionaire.

593
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,667
It says your...

594
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,562
It says your wife will die
in a hay fire.

595
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:57,717
But I don't have a wife.

596
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,178
You will,
but it ain't gonna be me.

597
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:23,090
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

598
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:24,474
Do you think I'm attractive?

599
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:27,825
No. You look fine
the way you are... skinny.

600
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:30,486
When I sit down to eat,
I get sexy!

601
00:36:30,525 --> 00:36:33,078
When I go to bed, I get hungry!

602
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:36,432
I saw a man lying in the street,
and I said, "Can I help you?"

603
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,997
He said, "No.
I just found a parking space."

604
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,403
"Now I sent my wife
to go buy a car!"

605
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:44,884
It's just murder what's going on
with people these days.

606
00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:47,478
Just the other day,
right here in Xenia, Ohio...

607
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:50,385
a man walked up to me and said,
"I haven't eaten in 3 days."

608
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:51,955
I said, "Force yourself!"

609
00:36:51,997 --> 00:36:54,582
Another man
walked up to me and said...

610
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:55,700
"I haven't eaten in a week!"

611
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:58,458
I said, "Don't worry.
It tastes the same!"

612
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,643
All right! We're rolling!
I love this crowd!

613
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:23,095
Peoples got to work
for a livin'.

614
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:25,369
I believe in a blue-collar race.

615
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,819
I think suicide's
the only way out... out of life.

616
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:32,887
I wanted to die.
I tried to die, but I didn't.

617
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:37,332
They say it's my depression,
but what the fuck, man?

618
00:38:37,372 --> 00:38:39,347
I don't fuckin' know any more.

619
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:42,617
Which way
should I fuckin' turn, man?

620
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:07,579
Shut up!

621
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,020
- I hate that dog.
- I hate it, too.

622
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:10,132
It's mean and ugly.

623
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:12,954
It's got two sets of teeth,
like a shark.

624
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,671
That's why Roy calls it Sharky.

625
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,912
Yeah. The other day I saw it
eating a turkey bone.

626
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,337
I swear it looked like
it was choking on the bone.

627
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,842
I wish it would choke
and shut up.

628
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,251
Yeah. I was gonna go tell
Miss Barry, but...

629
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:25,561
After the last time?

630
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,190
After last time, I didn't even
want to get near her front door.

631
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:29,115
"You kids
get out of my front yard..."

632
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:30,392
"or I'm calling the police!"

633
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:32,916
- You want sparkles?
- Hell, no.

634
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,483
You don't want sparkles?

635
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:37,558
I want sparkles, Darb.
You can do my toes.

636
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,636
OK. When I'm done with hers.

637
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:40,854
Don't rush her.

638
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:45,205
You're getting better, Darb.

639
00:39:56,221 --> 00:40:00,312
This woman and this man,
they was married.

640
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:05,105
Was real good friends
until another woman came along.

641
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:07,417
Now they're lesbians.

642
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,972
Disgusting... two women
biting at each other...

643
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:11,638
if you get my drift.

644
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,400
I think that... that's nasty.

645
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,183
Man, I get the chills.

646
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:18,163
I'm a party boy.

647
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:19,612
Not only that...

648
00:40:19,644 --> 00:40:22,841
you'll be... be pickin' up
women in your pickup, man.

649
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:25,593
Yeah. My pickup, man. Yeah.

650
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:27,636
That's the way I am.

651
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,426
Turn fifteen, I'm partyin'.

652
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:35,003
Without wood,
there'd be no America.

653
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:37,971
No ships to bring the pilgrims
across the ocean.

654
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:41,788
No log cabins,
no schoolhouses...

655
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,919
no churches,
no covered wagons...

656
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,826
no rail road ties...

657
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:49,973
no cigar store indians...

658
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,387
no nothin'.

659
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,455
Solomon, are you down there?

660
00:41:54,108 --> 00:41:55,668
What are you doing
lifting weights?

661
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:58,164
- I'm lifting.
- You'll stunt your growth.

662
00:41:58,204 --> 00:41:59,764
You're gonna get
peg leg shoulders...

663
00:41:59,805 --> 00:42:01,692
and pinched neck nerves.

664
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:03,699
It's not good to lift
while you're growing.

665
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,235
I can see your shoulder
popping out.

666
00:42:05,276 --> 00:42:07,185
Look at the way
it raises and gets smaller...

667
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:08,919
raises and gets smaller.

668
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:12,376
You're gonna pop out a joint.
That's not healthy.

669
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,234
Look at it. It's gonna pop.

670
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:25,879
Your dad's old taps.

671
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,323
He used to be good.

672
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:31,578
He said he was blessed
with the gift of tap.

673
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:33,816
Took up tapping
when he got his bald spot.

674
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:36,406
He wanted to get transplants...

675
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,485
but I thought
that was a bit drastic.

676
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:42,419
Told him if he wanted to,
he should take up tap.

677
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:45,333
He put up the mirror.

678
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:49,686
He said if Marlene Dietrich
could see him dance...

679
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:51,219
she would fall in love.

680
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,529
What do you want
with Marlene Dietrich?

681
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:57,106
She had her bottom ribs
surgically removed...

682
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:59,767
so she'd have
more of an hourglass figure.

683
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,626
Don't you know stars are flawed?

684
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:09,589
Will you smile?

685
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,800
Come on, I want a smile.

686
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:13,145
Tuck in that tummy.

687
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,587
One smile. Come on.

688
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,660
I'm gonna tickle you
till you smile.

689
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,107
Flatten that tummy.

690
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,896
Hold your shoulders in.

691
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:23,701
Do you miss your dad? I do.

692
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,878
Come on, hold that tummy in.

693
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,956
Come on,
can you smile for me, please?

694
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:32,409
OK, you son of a bitch...

695
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,866
if you don't smile,
I'm gonna kill you, OK?

696
00:43:34,908 --> 00:43:37,297
I've killed before,
and I will kill again.

697
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,853
I will pick up your brains
all over the floor.

698
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:42,299
You came out of my womb...

699
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,340
and I'll stick you
right back in my womb.

700
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,348
If you don't smile,
I'm going to kill you.

701
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,813
Yeah, party.

702
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,533
Break dance.

703
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:27,604
I have a good personality.

704
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:31,387
I have blond hair, blue eyes.

705
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,998
I'm a hundred
and thirty-five pounds...

706
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:37,938
and I'm 4' 101/2.

707
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,955
I have very light skin.

708
00:44:39,996 --> 00:44:44,186
I am considered
what you would call an albino.

709
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:48,279
I like men
that are very sensitive...

710
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:53,402
that will sit down and watch
a good movie with me...

711
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:55,258
won't hit on me...

712
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,853
will love me for me.

713
00:44:56,892 --> 00:45:02,042
I like men that either have
blond hair, blue eyes...

714
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:03,865
or...

715
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,842
black or brown hair.

716
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:09,146
Actually, the eyes,
it really doesn't matter.

717
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,548
My favorite movie stars are...

718
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,541
Pamela Anderson
and Patrick Swayze.

719
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,035
Patrick Swayze is sexy.

720
00:45:18,077 --> 00:45:19,603
He's good-lookin'.

721
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:21,433
I love that man to death.

722
00:45:22,812 --> 00:45:26,773
I would pay money to touch him.

723
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:29,398
When I was born...

724
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:33,048
I was born without any toes
on my feet at all.

725
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:35,932
I would pick things up
with the balls of my feet...

726
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:37,558
instead of my toes.

727
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:40,825
I had trouble
walking on my feet.

728
00:45:53,724 --> 00:45:56,539
Clifford Dumkin
is the fat cocaine addict...

729
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:59,126
who lives down by my house.

730
00:45:59,164 --> 00:46:03,059
He's into wife-swapping
and sex parties.

731
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:06,866
He gives girls cocaine,
and he fucks them...

732
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:09,756
in front of different kids
in the neighborhood.

733
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,861
Every time I see him...

734
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,583
he's got cocaine
all over his mustache.

735
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:22,778
- Watch her eyes.
- I want a mustache, damn it!

736
00:46:22,812 --> 00:46:24,754
- Get her underbelly.
- Her underbooty.

737
00:46:26,685 --> 00:46:29,019
- Get her nipples.
- I want a mustache!

738
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,165
It's OK, Foot Foot.

739
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,441
I want to look like
Burt Reynolds!

740
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,545
I want a mustache, damn it!

741
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:44,054
Oh, baby, it's OK.

742
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:49,618
- Gotta calm down.
- I want a mustache, damn it!

743
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:25,587
Get down!

744
00:47:33,756 --> 00:47:35,731
No! Get down now!

745
00:47:54,557 --> 00:47:56,313
Do you still miss her?

746
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:59,513
Yeah. There's not a day goes by
that I don't miss her.

747
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:03,993
Sure seems that way sometimes.

748
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:06,963
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

749
00:48:08,445 --> 00:48:10,900
Do you think
she looked a little like me?

750
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,849
Yeah, she looked
a little bit like you.

751
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:16,790
She's in heaven now.

752
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:18,454
Yeah, she's in heaven now.

753
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,220
What was she like?

754
00:48:24,925 --> 00:48:26,834
Oh, she's... Brown hair.

755
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:29,626
She drinked, you know,
a little bit...

756
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,635
but she was a good person.

757
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:35,189
She was real nice, she was.

758
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:37,171
When I was a kid,
I remember growin' up.

759
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:39,665
There was this man
that raised me.

760
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,425
His wife walked around
in her underclothes...

761
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,209
and he'd always tell us...

762
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:46,586
all us boys
that worked for him...

763
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,929
you know, when you'd come in...

764
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:49,688
she'd be walking around
getting ready for work...

765
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:51,961
told us not to bug her.

766
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,363
They always warned us,
you know, don't...

767
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:56,916
you can look, but don't touch.

768
00:48:56,957 --> 00:48:58,779
It was hard to do...

769
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:00,852
when there was something
tempting in front of you...

770
00:49:00,893 --> 00:49:03,926
as pretty and good-lookin'
as she was...

771
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:05,688
you know and everything.

772
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:08,594
But you got to respect
somebody else's wife...

773
00:49:08,636 --> 00:49:10,163
in other words.

774
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,370
His dad never gave a crap.

775
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:28,380
Not even at the end of his game.

776
00:49:29,372 --> 00:49:32,023
It was scary to see him
despondent like that.

777
00:49:33,276 --> 00:49:36,244
His dad didn't care
for mom much, either...

778
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:37,713
or the little doggie.

779
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,373
He started going to church...

780
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:43,989
and he started listening
to the gospels.

781
00:49:45,213 --> 00:49:48,279
It was expected
when he robbed the neighbors.

782
00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:49,723
He took their wine...

783
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:52,539
and he took
some rings and fine jewelry.

784
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,318
I think he got a fur coat
as well.

785
00:49:56,348 --> 00:49:58,323
When he had a kid...

786
00:49:58,364 --> 00:50:01,211
he didn't think
to watch his ways.

787
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:02,837
He felt the same as his daddy.

788
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,111
Come on, put it back up.

789
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,156
- Let's go!
- Come on, man!

790
00:50:11,196 --> 00:50:13,684
Go! Go, God damn it!

791
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:15,633
- Fuckin' get it!
- Put it up!

792
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:19,833
- Let's go.
- Tell me when you're ready.

793
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:21,494
Get that motherfucker.

794
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:23,988
On your marks, set, go.

795
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:25,915
Get him, God damn it, go!

796
00:50:25,948 --> 00:50:27,890
Fuck him up, Tummy!

797
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:30,453
Get it, boy! Get it, goddamn!

798
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:32,467
Don't be afeared!

799
00:50:38,717 --> 00:50:40,822
- Got beat, didn't ya?
- Hell, yeah!

800
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,070
Shit!

801
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:46,074
Don't you know it's a sin
to get beat by your son?

802
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:47,897
Shoop, shoop, shoop

803
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:49,874
He got beat, he got beat

804
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,120
He got beat by his own son

805
00:50:52,157 --> 00:50:53,847
He got beat, he got beat

806
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,989
He got beat by his own son

807
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:57,490
He got beat, he got beat

808
00:50:57,532 --> 00:50:59,125
He got beat by Tummy

809
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:01,685
He got beat,
he got beat by mummy

810
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:18,455
- Who's next?
- Who's next?

811
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,637
How about the girls?

812
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:23,801
You two wrestle...
have an arm wrestle.

813
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:28,219
- Come on. Get it goin'.
- Get it on!

814
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,722
Let's see what we got.
You sit there and there.

815
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:35,130
All right, let's see it.

816
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:38,837
Do they even know
how to arm wrestle?

817
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:41,015
Now, are you guys ready?
You guys ready?

818
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:42,361
On your mark...

819
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:45,625
No holdin' the table.

820
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:47,635
Hand up in the air.

821
00:51:47,676 --> 00:51:49,586
Get steady...

822
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:51,384
- Are you ready?
- No, not really.

823
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:53,395
You ready?

824
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:54,778
- Ready.
- You ready?

825
00:51:55,932 --> 00:51:57,393
Go!

826
00:51:57,437 --> 00:52:00,120
- Come on!
- Come on!

827
00:52:00,156 --> 00:52:04,019
Go, God damn it! Yeah!

828
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,172
There.

829
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:11,701
God! Get beat like that,
that's awful.

830
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,201
It's all right. It's all right.

831
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:15,219
- I take pride...
- I tried.

832
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,130
She did her bit. She tried.

833
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:19,699
You gave it all.

834
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,463
Any more fucking beer?

835
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,929
- That's it.
- Fuck.

836
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:24,728
Man, fuck all this bullshit.

837
00:52:24,764 --> 00:52:27,153
I can piss in this bottle,
fill it back up.

838
00:52:27,197 --> 00:52:29,139
- Fuck that.
- Have to go for a beer run.

839
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:34,930
- Who's next?
- The big man, little man!

840
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:37,012
Let's get it. Come on.

841
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,809
That's what I want to see.

842
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:40,338
Let's go, buddy.

843
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:43,414
Show him what you got, man.
Fuck him up.

844
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,689
- Come on!
- Ready?

845
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:46,869
Go!

846
00:52:46,908 --> 00:52:48,850
Come on! Get it! Get it!

847
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:50,965
- Go! Go!
- Come on!

848
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,687
You got it! Come on! Get him!

849
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,947
Fuck this shit!

850
00:52:58,044 --> 00:52:59,189
Damn!

851
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:03,091
Fuck this shit, man!

852
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:07,795
Did the little man get you,
buddy?

853
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:10,422
- Motherfucker.
- You should be ashamed.

854
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,915
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

855
00:53:14,364 --> 00:53:15,608
Loser.

856
00:53:15,644 --> 00:53:17,816
You can lose with pride,
though, man, shit.

857
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:23,672
Little fuck
can break our assholes anyway.

858
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,748
Not true, motherfucker.

859
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:35,034
Aren't you a little girly
from Salt Lake City?

860
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:38,099
Two-quart legs
and two rubber titties.

861
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,409
Two-quart legs
and two rubber titties...

862
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:42,452
She loves electricity,
but she burns off gas.

863
00:53:42,492 --> 00:53:45,110
Got a V-8 pussy
and a cadillac ass.

864
00:53:48,828 --> 00:53:51,032
That little girl
from Salt Lake City...

865
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:53,141
two-quart legs
and two rubber titties.

866
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,936
Loves electricity,
but she burns off gas.

867
00:53:54,972 --> 00:53:57,339
Got a V-8 pussy
and a cadillac ass.

868
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:07,803
Get in there!

869
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:10,073
Don't let him get on you, man!

870
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:12,443
Get him out! Come on!

871
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,410
Come on, man, get him down!

872
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:22,036
Fuck him up! Come on!

873
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:23,865
Get him!

874
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,683
Come on! Don't let him
fuck with you like that!

875
00:54:26,716 --> 00:54:29,466
He ain't got no damn business
fucking with you.

876
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,500
- Goddamn!
- Kill him!

877
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,159
Break him down!

878
00:54:35,196 --> 00:54:37,268
Get him down and beat
the fucking hell out of him!

879
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:38,802
- Come on!
- Stomp his head!

880
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:42,390
- Stomp his ass!
- Hit him one more time.

881
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:47,313
- Fuck him up.
- Get him!

882
00:54:57,244 --> 00:54:58,870
There you go!

883
00:54:58,908 --> 00:55:01,756
Goddamn,
dig his fucking grave, man!

884
00:55:01,788 --> 00:55:02,933
Come on!

885
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:08,758
Teach that motherfucker.

886
00:55:10,012 --> 00:55:11,474
There you go!

887
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:14,330
Hit him in the head!

888
00:55:14,364 --> 00:55:15,509
Smash his brains!

889
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,027
Look at that.

890
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:26,968
- Ain't no ambulance.
- Oh, well.

891
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,117
Spit on him.

892
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:31,699
Life's a bitch,
and then you die.

893
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,950
There you go.

894
00:56:35,388 --> 00:56:36,697
It's a cat trap.

895
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:40,920
I want it high.

896
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:12,274
The doctor said they're
gonna have to take off...

897
00:58:12,316 --> 00:58:13,876
one of my boobies...

898
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:17,466
and I know what happens
when they do that.

899
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:20,851
Boys'll stop looking at me...

900
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:26,003
and once,
when I finally meet a guy...

901
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,946
that likes me,
and he sees my scar...

902
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,981
he'll just stop talking to me
for no reason.

903
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:37,081
Boys are like that.

904
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:43,795
Dear world...

905
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:47,698
I have confusion around me in
every direction from my brain.

906
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,115
I've tried and tried to make it
here in this fucking world...

907
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:55,124
but I think it was a mistake
that I was ever born.

908
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,131
I do not feel guilty
about taking my own life.

909
00:58:58,173 --> 00:59:00,693
I've tried your ways.

910
00:59:00,732 --> 00:59:05,140
I've had a job
since I was thirteen years old.

911
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:08,759
Making a living
was never a real problem for me.

912
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:14,100
The problem was all I see
is misery and darkness.

913
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,082
Die, die, die.

914
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:17,979
I'll put a gun
to my fucking head right now.

915
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:35,346
I'm so pissed I could kill you,
but I'm not going to.

916
00:59:37,756 --> 00:59:39,512
Life is beautiful.

917
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:41,458
Really it is.

918
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,922
Full of beauty and illusions.

919
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,427
Life is great.

920
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,460
Without it, you'd be dead.

921
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,126
I think one of the reasons
she didn't struggle so much...

922
00:59:51,164 --> 00:59:52,725
is I said,
"You're a black witch."

923
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:54,073
"We're giving you
the greatest honor..."

924
00:59:54,108 --> 00:59:57,457
"to sit at the right hand
of Arioch in hell."

925
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,249
Jarrod ain't here.

926
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:27,924
Go like that.

927
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:49,844
He's got a gay one.

928
01:02:49,885 --> 01:02:51,314
Come on.

929
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:18,898
Is she dead?

930
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,417
She's alive on that machine.

931
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,223
She stinks.

932
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:38,075
Her life is over.

933
01:03:39,644 --> 01:03:41,171
She smells like baked ham.

934
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,227
Bet she could live like this
forever.

935
01:03:48,764 --> 01:03:50,422
Do you think
she'll ever wake up?

936
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,591
Hell, no.

937
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:54,741
She's dead as hell.

938
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:58,458
Go over and shoot her
in the foot.

939
01:04:00,828 --> 01:04:01,940
Why?

940
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:05,521
Try and wake her up.
Shoot her in the foot.

941
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:30,614
I told you she's dead.

942
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:37,620
Could live forever
on one of these gadgets.

943
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,761
She'll be dead now.

944
01:04:57,213 --> 01:04:58,871
She's always been dead.

945
01:05:01,757 --> 01:05:03,862
She's been gone a long time.

946
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:07,249
She sure stinks.

947
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:19,321
French fries, sittin' on a bench

948
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:23,185
May I, want I, fifteen cents

949
01:05:23,228 --> 01:05:25,301
You miss, you miss

950
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,933
You miss like this

951
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,195
This is my baby...

952
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:36,690
and I breast-feed it.

953
01:05:48,604 --> 01:05:51,255
I'm its mother.

954
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:56,344
I...

955
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,070
I love my babies.

956
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:05,210
I love...

957
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:07,219
to handle babies...

958
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,082
because I love my babies.

959
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,405
And I kiss them on their head...

960
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,064
on their bald head.

961
01:06:16,316 --> 01:06:18,520
And I rub its head.

962
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,985
I love it...

963
01:06:20,028 --> 01:06:22,395
and I hug it...

964
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:24,468
then I kiss it, then I rub it.

965
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,625
I rub its head.

966
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,617
Sometimes, though,
I do something. I do it.

967
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,726
My mom tells me, "Do something,"
then I do it.

968
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:38,357
And I do it and do it.

969
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,458
I clean house.
I sweep the floor.

970
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:44,467
"Get in there
and mop that floor up."

971
01:06:44,508 --> 01:06:47,061
I get in here
and mop the floor up.

972
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,035
Whether it's water
or whether it's not water...

973
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:51,287
I clean it up.

974
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,874
And then when I cleaned it up...

975
01:06:56,156 --> 01:07:01,174
I had it all straightened up,
even my dolls and all...

976
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:03,252
straightened up.

977
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:06,041
Now I always keep my toys...

978
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:08,410
because I take care of them.

979
01:07:08,444 --> 01:07:13,594
And I always do, and I always do
take care of them.

980
01:07:13,628 --> 01:07:16,411
And then,
when I went to a store...

981
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:20,405
I came back, and I got
in a hurry behind the car...

982
01:07:20,444 --> 01:07:24,984
and I broke
a... a spaghetti sauce.

983
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,508
And when I did,
I got in trouble for it.

984
01:07:28,604 --> 01:07:32,019
And then, I didn't break it...

985
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,548
but this always happens.

986
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,267
And then I turned around
and looked...

987
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,456
and I said, "Laurel,
you going to have to pray."

988
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:45,143
"No, you got to pray."

989
01:07:46,204 --> 01:07:48,986
And she said, "Pray about what?"

990
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,289
And I said,
"You going to have to pray."

991
01:07:51,325 --> 01:07:53,397
You do have to pray...

992
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,963
white or black or whatever.

993
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,117
Some people came by here.

994
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:59,058
We're going to have
a lot of people here today.

995
01:08:00,316 --> 01:08:03,219
So we had to get up
this morning...

996
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,372
and we did.

997
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,853
Here it goes.

998
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:18,012
Boy. I'm getting that stuff
in my hair.

999
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,849
Well, well, well.

1000
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,321
Here I go.

1001
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,475
OK... in my hair.

1002
01:10:33,308 --> 01:10:34,421
Miss?

1003
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:38,076
Miss, we've lost our cat,
and its name is Foot Foot.

1004
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,018
It's black,
and it's got green eyes.

1005
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,257
- What?
- We lost our cat.

1006
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:45,623
What do you want me to do?

1007
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,772
Well, if you see it,
could you call us?

1008
01:10:46,812 --> 01:10:48,186
- We live right over here.
- All right.

1009
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,129
Short black hair, kind of big.

1010
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:53,434
I don't live here in this town.

1011
01:10:53,468 --> 01:10:55,770
But if... I will. I sure will.

1012
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:57,909
I haven't seen one, but I'll...

1013
01:10:57,948 --> 01:11:00,021
Please keep an eye out.

1014
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,140
It's bad to lose one.

1015
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,700
I know mine went off one time,
but it come back.

1016
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:05,528
- I hope so.
- Now I don't have one.

1017
01:11:05,564 --> 01:11:08,281
- It died, you know.
- Oh, sorry.

1018
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:10,356
Black with green eyes.

1019
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:13,560
- Foot Foot?
- Yeah. Foot Foot.

1020
01:11:13,596 --> 01:11:14,806
Where'd you all lose him at?

1021
01:11:14,844 --> 01:11:18,193
If I see one,
I'll come back and tell you.

1022
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:20,505
The number's on the flyer.
You can just call our number.

1023
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,061
- Yeah. All right.
- Ask for Helen, Dot, or Darby.

1024
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,212
All right.

1025
01:12:03,228 --> 01:12:05,138
Those people are deaf.

1026
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:07,857
I'll bet she's cussing him out.

1027
01:12:10,236 --> 01:12:12,123
You want mayonnaise, Darb?

1028
01:12:12,156 --> 01:12:13,334
- You don't?
- No.

1029
01:12:21,724 --> 01:12:23,634
Is this your cat?

1030
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,377
Freddie Prinze was my brother.
Do you know of him?

1031
01:12:30,396 --> 01:12:33,363
He was on that television series
called "Chico and the Man."

1032
01:12:33,404 --> 01:12:34,615
Did you ever hear of that?

1033
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,678
He was an actor.

1034
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:39,829
What do you do?

1035
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:43,954
I'm a gossip writer
for a newspaper.

1036
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:46,898
- Gossip?
- You know gossip?

1037
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:51,575
It's like...
Tupac Shakur stuttered.

1038
01:12:51,612 --> 01:12:55,409
Warren Oates swallowed
his chewing tobacco spittle.

1039
01:12:55,452 --> 01:12:58,201
Placido Domingo
loves sherbet ice cream.

1040
01:12:58,236 --> 01:13:00,887
Adolf Hitler had one testicle.

1041
01:13:02,332 --> 01:13:05,714
P.T. Barnum had an ulcer
the size of a small oyster.

1042
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,723
Henry Winkler
is allergic to papaya.

1043
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:12,113
Satchel Paige
shot heroin down in Cuba.

1044
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:15,571
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer
drank denatured alcohol.

1045
01:13:15,612 --> 01:13:16,986
That's gossip.

1046
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,449
And that's what you get paid
for doing?

1047
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,653
I get paid for writing rumor.

1048
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:40,146
How much further is it
to where you saw Foot Foot?

1049
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:42,425
It's right nearby here.
It's right around here.

1050
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,638
Where?

1051
01:13:43,676 --> 01:13:45,815
Well, I'm not sure exactly,
but is there a map?

1052
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:48,186
There's a map in the glove box
or here somewhere.

1053
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,780
Maybe it's under the seat
down there.

1054
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,543
Let me... let me see
if I can reach it.

1055
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,914
- I don't see no map around.
- Maybe I can...

1056
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:56,121
What are you doing?

1057
01:13:56,156 --> 01:13:57,880
Why'd you try and touch
her kootchy?

1058
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:00,698
- I didn't do anything.
- Pervert!

1059
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:05,526
- Now, come on.
- Get out of here!

1060
01:14:05,564 --> 01:14:06,742
Don't touch her kootchy!

1061
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,024
Come on. Just give me a little.

1062
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,336
Let go of her!

1063
01:14:09,372 --> 01:14:11,608
- Get off!
- Fucking pervert!

1064
01:14:11,644 --> 01:14:13,018
Stop!

1065
01:14:13,052 --> 01:14:14,427
Just give me some. That's all.

1066
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:17,046
- Let go of her, motherfucker!
- You're hos anyway.

1067
01:14:17,084 --> 01:14:18,459
It's no big deal.

1068
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:20,663
It's nothing new
for trash like you.

1069
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,707
Kiss my ass, fucker!

1070
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:24,756
Motherfucker!
Don't touch my sister!

1071
01:14:24,796 --> 01:14:27,546
Nothing new for trash like you.

1072
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,173
Fuck you!

1073
01:14:29,212 --> 01:14:32,147
Baby. Fucking asshole!

1074
01:14:32,188 --> 01:14:34,130
Idiot!

1075
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,082
I knew a guy who was dyslexic...

1076
01:14:37,116 --> 01:14:39,156
but he was also cross-eyed...

1077
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:40,756
so everything came out right.

1078
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,409
Spaghetti.

1079
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,521
Hand me the shampoo.

1080
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,464
That's the conditioner.
Hand me the other bottle.

1081
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:17,209
Hi, my name is Terry.
This is my brother Phelipo.

1082
01:17:17,244 --> 01:17:18,324
Hi, ma'am.

1083
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:20,371
Would you be interested
in purchasing a crunch bar?

1084
01:17:20,412 --> 01:17:21,938
- How much?
- A dollar.

1085
01:17:23,452 --> 01:17:25,208
The money
goes for children with cancer.

1086
01:17:25,244 --> 01:17:27,066
Also,
it's for Hodgkin's disease.

1087
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,607
- Thanks.
- OK.

1088
01:17:31,644 --> 01:17:32,789
Have a nice day.

1089
01:17:41,884 --> 01:17:42,996
Some dessert?

1090
01:18:36,348 --> 01:18:38,420
Man, we be making
all this money.

1091
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,632
Yeah. All the hos like this.

1092
01:18:40,668 --> 01:18:42,424
Yeah. Buy the teachers, too...

1093
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,347
so I wouldn't have
to go to school no more.

1094
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,809
Tease people, too.

1095
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:48,535
Yeah. Make them my friend, then
I tease them with the money.

1096
01:18:48,572 --> 01:18:50,744
They'll be my friends
more often also.

1097
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:54,675
Yeah. We can have all this.
We can be rich.

1098
01:18:54,716 --> 01:18:56,985
We'll be going around
teasing women and stuff.

1099
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,224
Yeah. Selling candy,
getting money.

1100
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,634
Just selling candy,
getting money...

1101
01:19:00,668 --> 01:19:02,162
and making the greenbacks.

1102
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,951
I was all right

1103
01:19:04,988 --> 01:19:07,192
For awhile

1104
01:19:07,228 --> 01:19:09,050
I could smile

1105
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:11,932
For awhile

1106
01:19:11,964 --> 01:19:14,037
But I saw you last night

1107
01:19:14,076 --> 01:19:16,629
You held my hand so tight

1108
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,097
As you stopped

1109
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:21,369
To say hello

1110
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:24,055
Oh, you wished me well

1111
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:27,256
You couldn't tell

1112
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:29,015
That I'd been

1113
01:19:29,052 --> 01:19:31,321
Crying

1114
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:33,658
Over you

1115
01:19:33,692 --> 01:19:35,864
Crying

1116
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,234
Over you

1117
01:19:38,268 --> 01:19:39,959
And you

1118
01:19:39,996 --> 01:19:42,385
Said so long

1119
01:19:42,428 --> 01:19:44,883
Left me standing

1120
01:19:44,924 --> 01:19:46,811
All alone

1121
01:19:46,844 --> 01:19:50,008
Alone and crying

1122
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:52,378
Crying

1123
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:54,714
Crying

1124
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:55,926
Crying

1125
01:19:55,964 --> 01:20:01,147
It's hard to understand

1126
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,449
But the touch

1127
01:20:03,484 --> 01:20:05,426
Of your hand

1128
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,890
Can start me crying

1129
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:12,657
I thought that I

1130
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,285
Was over you

1131
01:20:15,324 --> 01:20:17,877
But it's true

1132
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:19,771
So true

1133
01:20:19,804 --> 01:20:22,390
I love you even more

1134
01:20:22,428 --> 01:20:25,079
Than I did before

1135
01:20:25,116 --> 01:20:29,589
But, darling, what can I do?

1136
01:20:29,628 --> 01:20:31,929
For you don't

1137
01:20:31,964 --> 01:20:34,265
Love me

1138
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:39,450
And I'll always be

1139
01:20:39,484 --> 01:20:41,905
Crying

1140
01:20:41,948 --> 01:20:44,370
Over you

1141
01:20:44,412 --> 01:20:46,834
Crying

1142
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,243
Over you

1143
01:20:49,276 --> 01:20:51,099
Yes

1144
01:20:51,132 --> 01:20:53,750
Now you're gone

1145
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:58,163
And from this moment on

1146
01:20:58,204 --> 01:21:01,270
I'll be crying

1147
01:21:01,308 --> 01:21:03,697
Crying

1148
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:06,161
Crying

1149
01:21:06,204 --> 01:21:08,244
Crying

1150
01:21:08,284 --> 01:21:13,651
Yeah, crying

1151
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:15,226
Crying

1152
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:20,219
Over

1153
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,146
You

1154
01:21:33,308 --> 01:21:35,991
Yes, Jesus loves me

1155
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:47,482
For the bible tells me so

1156
01:21:52,892 --> 01:21:54,747
Dial it now. It's a bad dime.
