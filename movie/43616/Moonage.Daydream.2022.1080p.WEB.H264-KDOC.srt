indifferent to the present.</i>

7
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:35,235
<i>There's a tension of a most
unfathomable nature.</i>

8

to be understood.</i>

9

00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,605
<i>And I'll say it again,
he's the greatest.</i>

161
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,047
<i>Listen, you don't have
to be bent to wear makeup.</i>

162
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,115
It looks good,
so why not wear it?

163
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,381
Even if it's camp,
but he's sexy, isn't he?

164
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,921
Sort of thing, really.

165
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,290
<i>If I can tart it all up enough,</i>

166
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:44,898
<i>maybe people will see that it
has a lot to do with just them.</i>

167
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,174
<i>What, with reflection?</i>

168
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:47,527
<i>Yeah, that it is really</i>

169
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,133
<i>a reflection
of what they're like.</i>

170
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,630
Mr. Powell, Mr. Jenkins.

171
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,173
Businessmen in general...

172
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,570
Best watch it.

173
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:59,176
How are you?

174
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,320
I'm very well,
thank you. How are you?

175
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:01,607
INTERVIEWER I'm fine.

176
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,543
Good. How are you?
How are you?

177
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,282
You, uh, have to get the gear on

178
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:07,954
in order to project yourself.

179
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,692
I mean, were you a nobody
who suddenly thought,

180
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,552
"Jesus, I must get into
the scene by some other way"?

181
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,202
I never asked
Jesus for a think, no.

182
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:15,467
It was always
on my own initiative.

183
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,655
And...

184
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,966
When I was 14, I became a Mod,

185
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,429
<i>and it just carried
on from there.</i>

186
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:23,343
I've always dressed
in what I considered clothes

187
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,664
that are exciting for me,

188
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,568
<i>um, to prevent me
becoming humdrum</i>

189
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:30,471
<i>so that I would receive
reaction from people</i>

190
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:32,044
<i>which would
encourage me to write.</i>

191
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,345
<i>You will have
obviously as many men followers</i>

192
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,116
<i>- as you have women followers.
- Yes.</i>

193
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,557
<i>I mean,
you haven't been shy about</i>

194
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:42,021
declaring a certain
air of bisexuality.

195
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,696
Not at all.
I know quite a few men.

196
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:49,094
<i>Some people feel you're...</i>

197
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,689
<i>By saying you're bisexual.</i>

198
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,363
<i>By... by kind of flaunting
that in a way...</i>

199
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:55,529
<i>Who's flaunting it?</i>

200
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:03,009
<i>Why do
you think that bisexuality in,</i>

201
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:06,111
say '72, '73 has become
a common... not a common,

202
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,047
but an accepted kind of deal.

203
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:09,323
<i>Why do you think we
have moved into that</i>

204
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:11,644
<i>era of liberal behavior?</i>

205
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,316
<i>Once upon a time, your father,</i>

206
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,582
<i>my father, everybody's
father, I presume,</i>

207
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:19,355
<i>wanted a good job, with a good
income, or reasonable income.</i>

208
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,755
<i>Some chance of promotion
to secure their family life.</i>

209
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,526
Um, where's the camera?

210
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,397
You're probably fine there,
and that's where it ended.

211
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:31,070
But now, people
want a role in society.

212
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,511
They want to feel that
they have a position.

213
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,337
They want to be an individual,

214
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,119
and I think there's
a lot of searching to find

215
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,011
the individual within oneself.

216
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,452
Right, and how about the shoes?

217
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:40,684
Are those men's shoes,
or women's shoes,

218
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,081
or bisexual shoes?

219
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,396
They're shoe shoes, silly.

220
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:54,126
<i>There was a feeling
of excitement and titillation</i>

221
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,589
<i>about moving in areas</i>

222
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:58,196
<i>which were forbidden
to the rest of society.</i>

223
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,370
<i>From micro to macro,
from yin to yang,</i>

224
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,042
<i>from male to female,</i>

225
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:12,507
<i>there is no scissor cut.
No absolute.</i>

226
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:18,777
<i>I believe that there was
an unconscious move to create</i>

227
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,813
<i>a high priest form from
the line of the Greek gods</i>

228
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,518
<i>who could procreate themselves.</i>

229

<i>Somebody who

Oh, Bowie.

282
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:09,007

You know what I mean?

00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:12,461
Do the clothes,
you are trying to say,

285
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,914
are the clothes expressed
now your own personality?

286
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,290
Um, no, that I've
never been quite clear about.

287
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:18,764
I've never been sure
of my own personality.

288
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,557
That's very refreshing.

289
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,832
That's a very refreshing thing
to hear somebody say that.

290
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,630
Very. But can you fill us
in on the barest outlines?

291
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:29,566
I'm a collector.

292
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:33,031
Um, and I've always just
seemed to collect personalities,

293
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,540
um, ideas. I have
a hodge podge philosophy

294
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:40,907
- which really is very minimal.
- Um, what?

295
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,755
Do you believe in God?

296
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,515
Um, I believe in an energy form.

297
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,011
I'm not... I wouldn't put a

298
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,947
I wouldn't like to
put a name to it.

299
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,323
Do you
indulge in any form of worship?

300
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,721
Um, uh, life.

301
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:55,658
I love life very much indeed.

302
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,666
<i>My strivings to have
some kind of spiritual base</i>

303
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:06,097
<i>were really, really
strong all my life,</i>

304
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>and I think I tried
to amalgamate</i>

305
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:11,003
<i>my own bedrock of spirituality.</i>

306
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,972
<i>I mean, I was
a Buddhist on Tuesday,</i>

307
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,941
<i>and I was into
Nietzsche by Friday.</i>

308
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:26,821
<i>Some time
flirting with Buddhism,</i>

309
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,658
<i>and spending some
time in a Buddhist retreat.</i>

310
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:30,924
<i>I mean, I felt at

<i>um, Buddha's answer to

<i>but I'm... the one thing that
hung over from that time</i>

313
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,606
<i>was the feeling
of impermanence and transience.</i>

314
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:45,444
<i>That was the one thing
that really struck home</i>

315
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:47,380
<i>about everything
that I was learning.</i>

316
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:49,041
<i>Nothing's gonna
stay around very long.</i>

317
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,581
<i>I mean, you know,
everything changes</i>

318
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,143
<i>different rates.</i>

319
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,750
<i>Some seem to me sort
of established for a bit,</i>

320
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:57,588
<i>but they're only moving at
a slower rate than other things</i>

321
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:00,525
<i>and they're all inevitably
sort of a change-over.</i>

322
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:15,034
<i>For me, there's always
been a thread of merely,</i>

323
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,410
<i>um, a search.</i>

324
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:20,039
<i>Generally, I think the subject
matters always come back</i>

325
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:23,482
<i>to this singular question
of nearly every artist,</i>

326
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,946
<i>which is what's my
relationship with the universe?</i>

327
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:28,718
<i>Whatever other form
it takes that's basic,</i>

328
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:31,149
<i>I think that's probably
the essential question</i>

329
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,987
<i>that all of us ask ourselves.</i>

330
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,429
<i>A lot of us probably
on that last few minutes.</i>

331
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:51,906
<i>What's Ziggy?</i>

332
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:54,810
<i>Ziggy, I wanted...
I wanted to define</i>

333

<i>the archetype
"Messiah Rock star."</i>

334

<i>That's all I wanted to do,</i>

<i>Ziggy was for
me a very simplistic thing:</i>

344
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,748
<i>What it seemed to
be, an alien rock star,</i>

345

<i>We want it all.</i>

<i>You know, we want

<i>and people to read the lyrics,
and read and everything</i>

352
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,628
<i>just to play the game.</i>

353
00:26:52,016 --> 00:26:54,060
<i>When I was really
young, one of the mysteries,</i>

354
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:57,118
<i>the great mystery of rock,
was that I hardly understood</i>

355
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:59,219
<i>a word of what they
were singing about.</i>

356
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:03,762
<i>Fats Domino, I still don't know</i>

357
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:05,764
<i>one word of one lyric
that he ever wrote.</i>

358
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,261
<i>I never understood
his pronunciation.</i>

359
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:11,066
<i>And that made it even more
mysterious, and wonderful,</i>

360
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,804
<i>and magic, you know?</i>

361
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,432
<i>That he was talking
about something</i>

362
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,907
<i>that I couldn't even
possibly start to understand,</i>

363
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:19,338
<i>and I wanted in.</i>

364
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:21,208
<i>I wanted to be in that place,</i>

365
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:24,409
<i>this alternate
universe, you know?</i>

366
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:27,049
<i>And that was so much
a part of the magic of music,</i>

367
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:28,985
<i>and the same with art.</i>

368
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,318
<i>I never really... I could
appreciate the Vermeer,</i>

369
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:34,925
<i>or Tintoretto, or Titian,
or something like that,</i>

370
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,191
<i>but because it was
symbolic and figurative,</i>

371
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:41,426
<i>it didn't... I was never that
impressed with virtuosity.</i>

372
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,198
<i>I was, you know, I understood
that their technique</i>

373
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,244
<i>and the way they applied
paint, and what they could do,</i>

374
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:49,269
<i>and how they could
embrace light and all that,</i>

375
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:52,305
<i>I understood and realized the,</i>

376
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,408
<i>and I bowed
in humbleness at their...</i>

377
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:59,180
<i>But it wasn't... I mean, that's
not what I wanted from it.</i>

378
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:00,984
<i>I wanted to use art.</i>

379
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,284
<i>I wanted to use art
in a different way in my life.</i>

380
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,187
<i>I wanted a sense that</i>

381
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,995
<i>all the nooks and crannies
that we don't understand</i>

382
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,228
<i>about the way that we live
through our day to day life,</i>

383
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:16,967
<i>and I wanted that
shown to me, you know?</i>

384
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:20,399
<i>Not in great clarity, but some
kind of physical manifestation</i>

385
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:24,106
<i>of these are the areas of life
that are causing you grief,</i>

386
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:27,912
<i>or euphoria, and you
don't really know why.</i>

387
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:29,815
<i>Why is it that you
wake up one day,</i>

388
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,511
<i>and an oak tree, hit by
the light in a certain way,</i>

389
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:37,889
<i>will produce these
extraordinary feelings of glee,</i>

390
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,484
<i>and absolute enjoyment,</i>

391
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,992
<i>exhilaration at
actually being alive.</i>

392
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:44,390
<i>Another day, you can wake up</i>

393
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:47,261
<i>and that same tree
will seem like some.</i>

394
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:51,496
<i>Caspar David Fried rich
symbolic death, you know?</i>

395
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:53,905
<i>And it will be dark and
negative and awful, you know?</i>

396
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,435
<i>And it's that sense of why
those things happen?</i>

397
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,405
<i>Why aren't things
the same every single day</i>

398
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,407
<i>and produce exactly
the same feeling?</i>

399
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,277
<i>And art always does that to me.</i>

400
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:18,325
<i>What are your hobbies?</i>

401
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,008
<i>Well, where
would you like to start?</i>

402
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:25,871
<i>Uh, I sculpt, paint,
and write films.</i>

403
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:28,973
<i>Um, I make video television.</i>

404
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:30,568
<i>Not programs,
but video television.</i>

405
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,274
<i>- Of what?
- Um, art things that I do.</i>

406
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:39,214
<i>Experimental video,
and cinematography.</i>

407
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:40,963
<i>With
the art now that you create,</i>

408
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,316
<i>the sculpturings...</i>

409
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:45,088
<i>Yeah, I have...
you'll see.</i>

410
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:49,257
<i>Is what</i>

411
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:52,458
<i>I play with video, yes.
I flirt an awful lot.</i>

412
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:04,206
<i>I've asked again,
over the last few years,</i>

413
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:06,142
<i>I've been identifying
again with a force.</i>

414
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:07,880
<i>I don't know how I'm going to...</i>

415
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:10,245
<i>How it will end up for me,</i>

416
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,183
<i>but, um, I can't pinpoint it,</i>

417
00:30:14,218 --> 00:30:16,317
<i>but I do have
a very strong belief in</i>

418
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:20,222
<i>in a force, and I don't
know how it works.</i>

419
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:23,324
<i>What I mean is, there is
something else other than us.</i>

420
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,491
<i>That's as near
as I can get to it,</i>

421
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:30,166
<i>and it may even just be
people on other planets</i>

422
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:31,431
<i>that I'm thinking about.</i>

423

<i>It may be God.</i>

424
00:30:33,138 --> 00:30:34,907
<i>It may be...
I don't know what it is,</i>

425
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:36,542
<i>but there's a definite
force that I feel.</i>

426
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,956
<i>Almost
like there's something else,</i>

427

<i>- that we're just a part of it.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

away for long periods,</i>

618
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:41,292

away and joined the RAF.</i>

<i>When he came back, he had very
evident signs of schizophrenia,</i>

00:44:21,999 --> 00:44:24,032
<i>because there was
mental illness in your family,</i>

638

640

<i>I think that probably became
part of the therapy of art,</i>

641
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,978
<i>and I was fortunate
enough to be able to</i>

642

<i>express any visions
that I had in my head.</i>

643
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,092
- Yeah.
- Very outwardly.

644
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:42,787
Gradually
learning to do without sleep.

645

<i>It's a labyrinthine
existence that we live,</i>

646
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:51,257
<i>and so it makes sense
for me to put together</i>

647
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,929
<i>elements in a song which</i>

648
00:44:52,964 --> 00:44:54,964
<i>wouldn't naturally
be good bedfellows.</i>

649
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,136
<i>I guess I'm trying to articulate</i>

650
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,338
<i>those mysterious
corners of the mind</i>

651
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,307
<i>where there exist
grains of truth</i>

652
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:10,243
<i>that we don't often touch on,</i>

653
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:12,850
<i>because we don't have
the words to capture them.</i>

654
00:45:15,052 --> 00:45:17,888
<i>So, we'll write on three or
four different subject matters,</i>

655
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,859
<i>and then integrate them
together by cutting them up.</i>

656
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:25,093
What I've used it for
more than anything else

657
00:45:25,128 --> 00:45:29,966
is igniting anything that
might be in my imagination.

658
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,572
I've tried doing it
with diaries and things,

659
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,234
and I was finding out
amazing things about me

660
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:36,368
and what I'd done
and where I was going.

661
00:45:37,976 --> 00:45:39,844
A lot of the things I had done,

662
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:42,275
it seemed that it would
predict things about the future

663
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,278
<i>and tell me a lot
about the past.</i>

664
00:45:45,313 --> 00:45:49,546
<i>I suppose it's a very
Western tarot. I don't know.</i>

665
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,548
<i>Obviously, one
is trying to always</i>

666
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,583
<i>reevaluate one's personality,</i>

667
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:56,388
<i>and understand why one works.</i>

668
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:01,360
<i>I think a lot of artists deal
with loneliness and solitude.</i>

669
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:07,597
<i>An artist does tend
to examine the world</i>

670
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,500
<i>through his relationship to it,</i>

671
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:11,403
<i>and so that produces</i>

672
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,471
<i>a very introverted looking
lot of work.</i>

673
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:16,474
<i>I don't feel lonely.
I apply that to my work.</i>

674
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:21,281
<i>I sense a feeling of loneliness
from my work when I look at it,</i>

675
00:46:21,316 --> 00:46:24,515
<i>but I don't feel like
a solitary person myself,</i>

676
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,385
<i>but it seems
to show up in my work,</i>

677
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,618
<i>and it's like taking
a photograph</i>

678
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,587
<i>and then developing the negative</i>

679
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:33,194
<i>and seeing another

intrigued by all this?</i>

692
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:27,380
Um, it was... I mean,

693
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:29,580
it filled a vast expanse
of my imagination.

694
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:31,219
I was always pretty imaginative.

695
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:36,224
And the imagination
can dry up in

696
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:38,424
wherever you're
living in England, often.

697
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:40,657
I mean, if there's
nothing to keep it going.

698
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,659
It just supplied a need in me.

699
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:46,597
American became
a myth-land for me.

700
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:55,573
We're not stopped.
Is there anything behind us?

701

00:48:04,254 --> 00:48:06,958
<i>to beautiful downtown Burbank
in Los Angeles.</i>

704
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:10,104
Is it true that you're gonna be

705
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:11,292
teaming up with...

706
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:14,328
Every avenue.

707
00:48:14,363 --> 00:48:17,166
It's very calm, and it's a kind
of a superficial calmness

708
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:19,278
that they've developed to
underplay the fact that it's...

709
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:22,204
There's a lot of high
pressure here,

710
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,140
as it's a very big
entertainment industry area.

711
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,507
<i>And you get this feeling
of unease with everybody.</i>

712
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:30,047
It's a very big
entertainment area.

713
00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:31,455
<i>The first time that it really</i>

714
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:34,084
<i>came home to me
what a strange...</i>

715
00:48:36,055 --> 00:48:39,749
<i>About the churches
designed by an architect.</i>

716
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,619
Arthur, would
you please slow down?

717

719
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:49,363
I mean, our sound
is bouncing around.

720
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:50,562
Yes, I can see it.

721
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:54,236
It'll be all right in a minute.

722
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:01,498
<i>Are you there, David?</i>

723
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,674
<i>Are you there, David?</i>

724
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,610
Bedroom in the sky.

725
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:07,381
<i>Are you there, Mr. David Bowie?</i>

726
00:49:16,689 --> 00:49:19,723
<i>I think that I felt often,</i>

727
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:24,332
<i>ever since I was a teenager,</i>

728
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:29,535
<i>um, so adrift, and so
not part of everyone I saw.</i>

729
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,406
<i>There's so many dark secrets</i>

730
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:33,737
<i>about my family in the cupboard</i>

731
00:49:33,772 --> 00:49:36,575
<i>that it kind of made me feel</i>

732
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,149
<i>very much on the outside
of everything,</i>

733
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:44,517
<i>and because of that, I felt
there was no basis to my life,</i>

734
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:46,552
<i>like everybody else
seemed to have.</i>

735
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,457
<i>Which of course is ridiculous.</i>

736
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:53,229
<i>Probably, I would
do things to prove that</i>

737
00:49:53,264 --> 00:49:56,166
<i>I had some emotional substance</i>

738
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:59,070
<i>when in fact I didn't.</i>

739
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,806
<i>Thematically, I've always
dealt with isolation</i>

740
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:44,676
<i>in everything I've written,
I think.</i>

741
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,876
<i>If you're
interested in isolation,</i>

742
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,780
<i>is it because you think that
a person in an isolated state</i>

743
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:53,124
<i>feel greater emotions
than they do</i>

744
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:55,786
<i>when they're surrounded
by people and things?</i>

745
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:58,624
<i>I think if he is in isolation,</i>

746
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:03,332
<i>instead of receiving
the whole world as his home,</i>

747
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:06,467
<i>he tends to create
a micro-world inside himself.</i>

748
00:51:06,502 --> 00:51:10,306
<i>Um, and it's that peculiar
part of the human mind</i>

749
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:12,671
<i>that fascinates me
about the small universes</i>

750
00:51:12,706 --> 00:51:15,707
<i>that can be created
inside the mind.</i>

751
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,248
<i>Some of them
fairly schizophrenic</i>

752
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,381
<i>and quite off the wall.</i>

753
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:25,552
<i>It feels now that
I don't come from anywhere,</i>

754
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:28,753
<i>but I was born in Brixton.</i>

755
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:30,337
<i>When were you born? What year?</i>

756
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:33,461
<i>1947. January the eighth.</i>

757
00:51:33,496 --> 00:51:36,563
<i>Makes me a Capricorn
with an Aquarius ascendant</i>

758
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:38,598
<i>and a Leo descendant.</i>

759
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:43,482
<i>How much now is left of the lad</i>

760
00:51:43,506 --> 00:51:45,176
<i>from Brixton, do you think?</i>

761
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:46,320
<i>Not very much, I would think.</i>

762
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,278
<i>I know, you know.</i>

763
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:52,216
<i>I never got... I never became
who I should have been.</i>

764
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:54,218
<i>I've spent an awful lot
of my life</i>

765
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:56,649
<i>actually looking
for myself, you know?</i>

766
00:51:56,684 --> 00:52:00,653
<i>And understanding what it was
that I-why-what I existed for.</i>

767
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:02,488
<i>What was it that really
made me happy in life?</i>

768
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,757
<i>And who exactly, or was...</i>

769
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,912
<i>Who are the parts of myself
I was trying to hide from?</i>

770
00:52:10,566 --> 00:52:13,666
<i>I think a lot of us
have huge senses of denial</i>

771
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,866
<i>about who we are and
where we exist in the world.</i>

772
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:19,881
<i>I really wanted to
sort of, you know,</i>

773
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:21,505
<i>be very emotionally involved
with people.</i>

774
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:24,281
<i>I didn't know how to do it.</i>

775
00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:25,716
<i>You know,
my parents were like that,</i>

776
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:27,515
<i>and I guess you kind of,
as they say,</i>

777
00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:30,881
<i>they pass on a lot of faults.</i>

778
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,722
<i>What do
your parents do for a living?</i>

779
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:41,265
My father's dead,
and my mother has a small flat,

780
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,532
and I think she's got a day job.

781
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,281
Does she have trouble
explaining you to the neighbors

782
00:52:46,305 --> 00:52:48,503
who say, "Are you
any relation to that".

783
00:52:48,538 --> 00:52:50,571
I think she pretends
I'm not hers.

784
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:54,476
Nah, she's uh,
she doesn't talk much.

785
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:57,644
You know, she doesn't,
um, I don't think we really...

786
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,481
We were never
that close particularly.

787
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:00,845
We have an understanding.

788
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,912
Yeah.

789
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:07,720
<i>Was it a happy marriage?</i>

790
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:10,426
<i>Not necessarily
terribly loving or anything,</i>

791
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,890
<i>in terms of
no real physical affection,</i>

792
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:17,400
<i>or even they
didn't really articulate</i>

793
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:18,566
<i>any love for each other.</i>

794
00:53:25,971 --> 00:53:28,510
<i>There's an awful lot of
emotional/spiritual mutilation</i>

795
00:53:28,545 --> 00:53:30,281
<i>goes on in my family.</i>

796
00:53:35,387 --> 00:53:38,487
<i>Did you like any
of the traditional people</i>

797
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:40,555
<i>that you're supposed to like?</i>

798
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,051
<i>Like, did you like
Winnie the Pooh?</i>

799
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,492
<i>No. No.</i>

800
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:44,922
<i>Rupert Bear?</i>

801
00:53:44,957 --> 00:53:46,594
<i>No.
No I didn't. I didn't like...</i>

802
00:53:46,629 --> 00:53:48,068
<i>Did you have a teddy bear?</i>

803
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,301
<i>No, I didn't.
I don't think.</i>

804
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:56,032
<i>I can't remember having
anything like that at all.</i>

805
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:59,277
<i>No, I never liked, um,
children's things very much.</i>

806
00:54:24,568 --> 00:54:26,007
<i>You know,
since you've been away,</i>

807
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:27,833
<i>or quite recently,
the newspapers</i>

808
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:30,308
<i>having been having a bit
of a bash at your mother?</i>

809
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,072
And saying that she's
a bit tearful from time to time.

810
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:39,515
And that she's suffered
a certain amount of anguish,

811
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,649
and that she doesn't hear
from you an awful lot.

812
00:54:41,684 --> 00:54:43,849
<i>Is that eyewash or is it real?</i>

813
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,658
<i>There's some kind of traumatism</i>

814
00:54:50,693 --> 00:54:53,089
<i>often goes on
in our childhoods I think.</i>

815
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,432
<i>I think, that are...</i>

816
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:57,379
<i>Makes us crave some kind
of strange affection, you know?</i>

817
00:54:57,403 --> 00:54:58,666
<i>It's sort of an...</i>

818
00:54:58,701 --> 00:55:00,404
<i>Often you'll find
that the person</i>

819
00:55:00,439 --> 00:55:02,406
<i>who craves a lot of affection</i>

820
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:04,474
<i>actually isn't terribly good
at giving it.</i>

821
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,942
Does that mean
you have to separate yourself

822
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:14,044
quite a lot from, say,
falling in love

823
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,651
and getting very involved
with a person?

824
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:20,116
Um, oh no, I think, no.

825
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,656
I think quite the reverse.

826
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:23,757
But, love, falling in love,

827
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:26,892
is different from then going on
to love that person.

828
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:28,157
Yes, it is. Yes.

829
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:30,533
And once you've
loved somebody a lot,

830
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:32,447
it means that you've got
to share your life with them.

831
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:34,141
- That's what I really...
- No, I don't think so.

832
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,770
I think you can love somebody
from afar.

833
00:55:36,805 --> 00:55:39,476
But if you then decided
not to love them from afar,

834
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:41,907
you as an artist
would have to give up

835
00:55:41,942 --> 00:55:43,777
quite a lot of your time
to them.

836
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,108
Yes, and I can't do that.

837
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:46,659
That's what I was wondering,

838
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:48,155
whether you did...
Whether you did that.

839
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,893
No, no, no, love can't
get quite in my way,

840
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:53,952
because I feel... I shelter
myself from it incredibly.

841
00:55:55,923 --> 00:56:00,959
<i>Do you feel removed
from the body and the feel</i>

842
00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:03,830
<i>that you create on the planet?</i>

843
00:56:03,865 --> 00:56:05,997
<i>Until I'm performing or writing</i>

844
00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:08,802
<i>I mainly feel pretty much

845
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:11,717
<i>When you're
performing and writing,</i>

846
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:13,070

847
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:15,974

<i>Well, an awful lot of changes</i>

871
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:47,251
<i>with my musical career</i>

872
00:59:47,286 --> 00:59:49,693
<i>were challenges to myself.</i>

873
00:59:49,728 --> 00:59:52,663
<i>I have to feel that I'm
stepping on new ground,</i>

874
00:59:52,698 --> 00:59:55,061
<i>that the ice beneath my feet
is very thin.</i>

875
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,667
<i>Any second, I could crack it</i>

876
00:59:56,702 --> 00:59:58,064
<i>and just plunge through
and drown.</i>

877
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,233
<i>I got to a point in Los Angeles</i>

878
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,972
<i>where I got very tired
with my method of writing,</i>

879
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:08,074
<i>and I wanted to invent
a new musical language.</i>

880
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:12,276
<i>I knew I had to get
to an environment</i>

881
01:00:12,311 --> 01:00:14,817
<i>that was totally different
to Los Angeles.</i>

882
01:00:14,852 --> 01:00:16,951
<i>So I thought
of the most arduous city</i>

883
01:00:16,986 --> 01:00:19,349
<i>that I could think of,
and it was West Berlin.</i>

884
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:22,792
<i>They don't give an FA about
who you are in Berlin.</i>

885
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,157
<i>The trappings of rock and roll
don't mean anything to them.</i>

886
01:00:25,192 --> 01:00:26,928
<i>So, I could walk around,
buy me own food,</i>

887
01:00:26,963 --> 01:00:29,161
<i>and just lease
a small apartment,</i>

888
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:31,702
<i>which I did above
an automobile spare parts shop.</i>

889
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:45,782
<i>I didn't have
the necessary verbal equipment</i>

890
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:47,883
<i>to describe what I was seeing,</i>

891
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:49,358
<i>and that's where
I needed assistance.</i>

892
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,963
<i>So, I contacted Brian Eno,</i>

893
01:01:01,998 --> 01:01:04,394
<i>who is definitely one
of the keenest brains</i>

894
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:06,330
<i>of modern music, and I said,</i>

895
01:01:06,365 --> 01:01:09,234
<i>"Look, Brian, I need to know
some new processes,</i>

896
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:11,005
<i>"and new methods of writing.</i>

897
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,974
<i>Please help me,
otherwise I'm packing it in."</i>

898
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:16,340
<i>We started working on a series</i>

899
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,343
<i>of processes and methods of
writing in the studio in Berlin</i>

900
01:01:19,378 --> 01:01:22,049
<i>to invent, a different kind
of linguistics to work with.</i>

901
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41,805
<i>Most of the things
that I do these days,</i>

902
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,104
<i>I go in with very little
preparation.</i>

903
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:46,535
<i>There's no governor,
no controller.</i>

904
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,406
<i>Every track is written
with a different process,</i>

905
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,782
<i>from spontaneous singing,</i>

906
01:01:51,817 --> 01:01:52,992
<i>I didn't know
what I was gonna sing,</i>

907
01:01:53,016 --> 01:01:54,477
<i>or how I was gonna sing it,</i>

908
01:01:54,512 --> 01:01:56,182
<i>and I just stood
in front of the mic,</i>

909
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:58,855
<i>right down
to fragmented, pre-thought,</i>

910
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,759
<i>analyzed and processed writings
of Burroughs' school.</i>

911
01:02:03,961 --> 01:02:05,895
<i>It probably touches areas
of emotion</i>

912
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,798
<i>that aren't normally dwelt upon</i>

913
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,492
<i>because they're arrived
at other than</i>

914
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:11,967

926

<i>I go in with very little
preparation,</i>

927
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,292
<i>just throw ideas out,</i>

928
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:16,097
<i>and you might make
little experiments sort of say,</i>

929
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:17,560
<i>look here's 50 seconds.</i>

930
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:20,266
<i>Play 10 notes on that 50 seconds</i>

<i>and don't repeat

932

01:03:30,113 --> 01:03:31,981
<i>Well, it is.</i>

934
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,444
<i>See, you must understand,</i>

935
01:03:33,479 --> 01:03:35,215
<i>I mean, it sounds
incredibly indulgent,</i>

936

<i>and indeed it is
because what I'm trying to do</i>

937
01:03:39,122 --> 01:03:42,453
<i>is mold the traditional
methods of rock and roll</i>

938
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,324
<i>with newer processes.</i>

939
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:51,033
<i>Trying to find
a new form of language.</i>

940
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:52,408
<i>Do you think you have influence</i>

941
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:53,970
<i>on their thinking, though?</i>

942
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:55,906
<i>No.</i>

943
01:03:55,941 --> 01:03:58,073
<i>And that's what I'm trying
to do with the new music,</i>

944
01:03:58,108 --> 01:04:01,109
is find a new language
which doesn't... it isn't that...

945
01:04:01,144 --> 01:04:03,540
Doesn't have that kind
of image influence.

946
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:08,292
<i>Do you think people
will understand that language?</i>

947
01:04:08,316 --> 01:04:10,184
<i>Yes.</i>

948
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:12,098
<i>Because I think people,
especially in the city context,</i>

949
01:04:12,122 --> 01:04:13,583
<i>think in fragments.</i>

950
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:16,421
The city person will see
a milk advert on the street,

951
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:18,192
and be thinking
"Milk, what's gonna...

952
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:19,468
"What are we gonna have
for dinner?

953
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:21,228
"Boy getting knocked down
by a bus,

954
01:04:21,263 --> 01:04:23,461
<i>crashed against a wall..."
that kind of thing.</i>

955
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:25,232
<i>So, he's thinking in terms of,</i>

956
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:28,664
<i>maybe 1,000 different images
at any given time.</i>

957
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:32,437
<i>And the language that Brian
and I are sort of producing</i>

958
01:04:32,472 --> 01:04:35,308
<i>is a language that can relate
to that way of thinking.</i>

959
01:04:46,255 --> 01:04:50,158
<i>We live within
this manifested idea</i>

960
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:52,028
<i>of what should be form,</i>

961
01:04:52,063 --> 01:04:55,625
and what we try and keep out
of our existence is chaos,

962
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:59,002
which is a very real part
of our lives,

963
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:01,631
and our refusal to accept chaos

964
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,732
as being integral
to our existence,

965
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,339
I think, has been one
of the greatest mistakes

966
01:05:06,374 --> 01:05:08,671
as a civilization
that we've made.

967
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:12,015
<i>My work as an artist</i>

968
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,530
<i>has always been
to do with transition.</i>

969
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:16,712
<i>The nature and study of change</i>

970
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:19,385
<i>in our particular era
is most important</i>

971
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,123
<i>because never in our history</i>

972
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:24,159
<i>has there been
such a rapid curve of change</i>

973
01:05:24,194 --> 01:05:25,721
<i>since the industrial revolution.</i>

974
01:05:27,197 --> 01:05:29,164
I'm a fairly
good social observer,

975
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,167
and I think
that I encapsulate areas

976
01:05:32,202 --> 01:05:35,104
every, maybe every year or so,

977
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:38,074
I tried to stamp
that down somewhere,

978
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:41,077
what that year is all about.

979
01:05:41,112 --> 01:05:42,419
Rather than
what it was all about,

980
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:44,476
or what it's going to be.

981
01:05:44,511 --> 01:05:47,248
It's very much trying to capture

982
01:05:47,283 --> 01:05:49,646
the quintessence of that year.

983
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:05,310
<i>I notice that the music now</i>

984
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:07,103
<i>is more... more daring,</i>

985
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:09,237
<i>more adventurous,
more fractured.</i>

986
01:06:09,272 --> 01:06:10,810
Is there a danger that
by following your instinct,

987
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,240
your aesthetic instincts,

988
01:06:12,275 --> 01:06:13,384
if you like,
your artistic instinct,

989
01:06:13,408 --> 01:06:16,574
that you will jeopardize that?

990
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:18,224
You know, the money
and the good life and all...

991
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:19,511
No shit, Sherlock.

992
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,417
Yes, I think I... Yes, I think
I rather sort of hit that one

993
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:25,682
in the head at the moment.

994
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:30,489
Um, and it's quite
a relief, really.

995
01:06:30,524 --> 01:06:36,165
I feel a lot more,
um, free than what I do.

996
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,201
I just needed, it just needed
a positive decision

997
01:06:39,236 --> 01:06:41,071
to only do what I want to do,

998
01:06:41,106 --> 01:06:42,706
and not do things
for the sake of what

999
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:48,177
either David Bowie or whoever
I was playing last time,

1000
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,443
Thin White Duke or something,
was expected to do.

<i>I went naked in Berlin.</i>

1002
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:59,485

1003
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,587
<i>to what I believed
to be absolute basic essentials</i>

1004
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:04,424

<i>I guess I was...
What I was really doing</i>

1007
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:11,431
<i>was doing that on an emotional
and spiritual level,</i>

1008
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:14,170
<i>but you manifest it physically.</i>

1009
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:16,535
<i>The surprising thing is,
is that we came up...</i>

1010
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,702
<i>We thought we were
just going to be into a process</i>

<i>of discovery and experiment</i>

1012
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:22,618

1013
01:07:22,642 --> 01:07:26,611

bringing things

1072
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:24,639

on to something else."

or a haircut, or a chair,</i>

1217
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:35,794
<i>not just
because it's functional,</i>

1218
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:37,521
<i>but for most of us</i>

1219
01:22:37,556 --> 01:22:39,276
<i>because it actually
says something about us.</i>

1220
01:22:41,527 --> 01:22:44,198
<i>I still, you know,
am sort of getting somewhere</i>

1221
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:47,036
<i>that I quite like,
but I'm still not.</i>

1222
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:48,471
<i>We'll find out eventually,
won't we?</i>

1223
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:53,075
<i>I might now be cut out
for all this, really,</i>

1224
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:55,110
<i>at the end.</i>

1225
01:22:55,145 --> 01:22:56,518
<i>Why did you change so often?</i>

1226
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:57,651
I mean,
what was the need for it?

1227
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:58,740
Was it just a gimmick?

1228
01:22:58,775 --> 01:23:00,346
Being a Capricorn.

1229
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:02,744
I didn't want to expose myself
to the public,

1230
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:05,087
so I developed a series
of characters.

1231
01:23:05,122 --> 01:23:07,485
So, behind that all the time
was a real David Bowie?

1232
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:09,454
At times, yes.

1233
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:11,060
I lost control
a couple of times.

1234
01:23:12,525 --> 01:23:14,294
So you're not...
This is really you.

1235
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:16,569
This is not you just still
sort of playing the role of...

1236
01:23:18,267 --> 01:23:19,530
One wonders.

1237
01:23:19,565 --> 01:23:21,829
I think
that it's not at all mystifying

1238
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:23,545
why you change your appearance
as often as you do,

1239
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:25,206
to my view by the way,

1240
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:29,309
because I think you've
used yourself as a canvas.

1241
01:23:29,344 --> 01:23:31,179
- Yes, very much so.
- Is that right?

1242
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,774
Yes, very much so.

1243
01:23:32,809 --> 01:23:37,746
Um, I never wanted to appear
as myself onstage ever,

1244
01:23:37,781 --> 01:23:39,418
at any time, until recently.

1245
01:23:39,453 --> 01:23:43,356
Were you hiding yourself
from us by doing that?

1246
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:46,227
Partly, but I was
enjoying it very much.

1247
01:23:46,262 --> 01:23:48,229
- And, you paint now?
- Yes.

1248
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:49,736
But your paintings,
you're not willing

1249
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,166
to let us see yet?

1250
01:23:51,201 --> 01:23:52,497
Uh, no.

1251
01:23:52,532 --> 01:23:53,608
I've been offered
two or three showings,

1252
01:23:53,632 --> 01:23:55,269
but I've turned

1253
01:23:55,304 --> 01:23:57,370
I've accepted two of them,
and then I broke my word

1254
01:23:57,405 --> 01:23:59,504
and said I wouldn't show them.

1255
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:01,374
I haven't yet bucked up
the courage.

1256
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:04,245
Why not?
What do you fear?

1257
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,760
Well, I know I'm a good writer.

1258
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:09,448
I'm not sure
about putting my paintings.

1259
01:24:09,483 --> 01:24:11,120
They're very personal
to me, as well.

1260
01:24:11,155 --> 01:24:13,353
Um, they're all portraits,

1261
01:24:13,388 --> 01:24:15,388
and they're portraits
of people in isolation.

1262
01:24:15,423 --> 01:24:19,161
Most of the paintings
are Germans or Turks

1263
01:24:19,196 --> 01:24:20,855
who live in Berlin,

1264
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,297
and they're either
from East Berlin,

1265
01:24:23,332 --> 01:24:24,804
and who are now living
in West Berlin,

1266
01:24:24,828 --> 01:24:26,234
and knowing their families

1267
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:28,203
are on the other side
of the wall.

1268
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,437
And so, I tried to capture
a lot of that isolation

1269
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:33,802
and I put a lot of myself
into the paintings as well.

1270
01:24:33,837 --> 01:24:35,144
They're very much part of me.

1271
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:55,626
<i>Well, I think
the question is what...</i>

1272
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:58,761
<i>You know, what you want to be
for yourself and your life.</i>

1273
01:24:58,796 --> 01:25:00,675
<i>I don't know whether
that's important anymore.</i>

1274
01:25:00,699 --> 01:25:02,897
<i>I mean, what I want
to do is just work well.</i>

1275
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:05,438
<i>When I'm working well,
I like my writing.</i>

1276
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:06,868
<i>At the moment, especially.</i>

1277
01:25:06,903 --> 01:25:08,705
<i>More than at any other time,
I think.</i>

1278
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,246
<i>I mean, I was getting so bored
with what I was writing.</i>

1279
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:13,545
<i>I just, I felt inadequate,
I thought my writing</i>

1280
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,909
<i>was becoming monotonous.</i>

1281
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:16,845
<i>I didn't take
the kinds of chances</i>

1282
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,253
<i>I was taking at one time.</i>

1283
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:21,751
<i>I thought if I'm going
to end up like,</i>

1284
01:25:23,722 --> 01:25:27,394
<i>um, a lot of other rock
and roll celebrities,</i>

1285
01:25:27,429 --> 01:25:28,857
<i>inasmuch
that I'm going to be trying</i>

1286
01:25:28,892 --> 01:25:30,826
<i>to retain the safe position,
you know?</i>

1287
01:25:30,861 --> 01:25:33,202
<i>And that's not what
I started out wanting to do.</i>

1288
01:25:33,237 --> 01:25:35,281
<i>But is it important to you
to have a mass audience?</i>

1289
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:36,381
<i>Do you want a lot of people to...</i>

1290
01:25:36,405 --> 01:25:37,437
<i>No. No.</i>

1291
01:25:37,472 --> 01:25:38,867
<i>I want to work well.</i>

1292
01:25:38,902 --> 01:25:41,573
<i>I want to...
I just have to work well.</i>

1293
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,479
<i>I think it's
an heroic act to take,</i>

1294
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:51,583
<i>um... to be able
to obtain enthusiasm</i>

1295
01:25:51,618 --> 01:25:54,883
<i>and joy from the actual process
of living from day to day.</i>

1296
01:25:56,524 --> 01:25:57,622
<i>Yes, very much.</i>

1297
01:25:57,657 --> 01:26:01,494
<i>I try. And it is, it is</i>

1298
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:03,661
<i>I think it takes practice to,</i>

1299
01:26:03,696 --> 01:26:07,302
<i>and concentration,
and exercise to enjoy it.</i>

1300
01:26:07,337 --> 01:26:10,503
<i>This is very easy to fall
into the trap of looking</i>

1301
01:26:10,538 --> 01:26:13,770
<i>for one's dreams and always
thinking of a future moment</i>

1302
01:26:13,805 --> 01:26:15,508
<i>when everything will be better.</i>

1303
01:26:15,543 --> 01:26:17,642
<i>And if the process
is not enjoyed,</i>

1304
01:26:17,677 --> 01:26:19,413
<i>the dreams will never come
to anything.</i>

1305
01:26:19,448 --> 01:26:21,712
<i>And by enjoying the process,</i>

1306
01:26:21,747 --> 01:26:23,450
<i>you are creating
a dream come true.</i>

1307
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:36,991
<i>I think I have an abundantly
healthy curiosity about life.</i>

1308
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:39,829
<i>About life around me,
specifically.</i>

1309
01:26:39,864 --> 01:26:43,536
<i>And how, how we put
ourselves together culturally,</i>

1310
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:46,341
<i>and I think it's served me well
as an artist,</i>

1311
01:26:46,376 --> 01:26:50,741
<i>in as much as I'm really
inquiring continually</i>

1312
01:26:50,776 --> 01:26:53,447
<i>into how things are made
and why we make them,</i>

1313
01:26:53,482 --> 01:26:57,946
<i>and the significance
or meanings behind things.</i>

1314
01:27:01,853 --> 01:27:05,954
<i>I'd be really scared of feeling
that I'd got somewhere,</i>

1315
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:09,430
<i>because for me,
art is about searching,</i>

1316
01:27:09,465 --> 01:27:10,827
<i>and if you come to a place</i>

1317
01:27:10,862 --> 01:27:12,829
<i>where you think
you've made a discovery,</i>

1318
01:27:12,864 --> 01:27:14,765
<i>I think that really is...</i>

1319
01:27:17,066 --> 01:27:19,341
<i>God, that would be
really demoralizing.</i>

1320
01:27:19,376 --> 01:27:21,343
<i>I think the search is the thing.</i>

1321
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:25,380
<i>♪ And you want to believe ♪</i>

1322

<i>♪ And we want to believe ♪</i>

<i>There's a gradual shift
when you reach mid 30s.</i>

1341
01:30:32,063 --> 01:30:33,733
<i>Uh, I think that
there's a period</i>

1342
01:30:33,768 --> 01:30:36,868
<i>where you have
to decide not to try</i>

1343
01:30:36,903 --> 01:30:41,609
<i>and grasp frantically
for the feelings of desperation</i>

1344
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:44,744
<i>and anger that you have
when you're in your mid 20s.</i>

1345
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:49,243
<i>And if you can relax into
the idea that being mid 30s</i>

1346
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:50,981
<i>is quite a nice place to be</i>

1347
01:30:51,016 --> 01:30:52,818
<i>with an amount of experience
behind you,</i>

1348
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,184
<i>I think the perspective changes.</i>

1349
01:31:03,193 --> 01:31:04,203
<i>You said once that there's</i>

1350
01:31:04,227 --> 01:31:06,062
<i>so many shells around you</i>

1351
01:31:06,097 --> 01:31:07,745
<i>that you don't know what
the p... looks like anymore.</i>

1352
01:31:07,769 --> 01:31:09,109
<i>Yeah,
well I've gone through that.</i>

1353
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:11,672
<i>I'm pretty aware
of what I'm like.</i>

1354
01:31:11,707 --> 01:31:13,542
<i>- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1355
01:31:13,577 --> 01:31:16,677
<i>I feel pretty-pretty happy
about my own relationship</i>

1356
01:31:16,712 --> 01:31:17,744
<i>to the world, and...</i>

1357
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:25,653
<i>We've got to be positive
about our days on this planet.</i>

1358
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,084
<i>I never realized
you were such an optimist.</i>

1359
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:29,690
<i>Well, I never was particularly.</i>

1360
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:32,286
<i>You're more romantic</i>

1361
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:35,025
<i>than people give you credit for.</i>

1362
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,994
<i>I think I'm probably
a lot more emotional</i>

1363
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:39,766
<i>than people would think
that I was.</i>

1364
01:31:39,801 --> 01:31:42,604
<i>I am emotionally very
responsive to life and people.</i>

1365
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:49,237
<i>I just wanted to come in touch
with a common factor</i>

1366
01:31:49,272 --> 01:31:51,173
<i>because I feel a need
at the moment to</i>

1367
01:31:52,308 --> 01:31:54,847
<i>be part of a society again,</i>

1368
01:31:54,882 --> 01:31:56,310
<i>and having traveled
an awful lot,</i>

1369
01:31:56,345 --> 01:31:59,181
<i>feel more and more
part of everything.</i>

1370
01:31:59,216 --> 01:32:00,985
<i>And I wish
to express that feeling.</i>

1371
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:04,021
<i>I don't want to seem
as though I'm detached and cold</i>

1372
01:32:04,056 --> 01:32:05,660
<i>because I'm not.</i>

1373
01:32:09,127 --> 01:32:11,061
<i>You seem very sure of yourself,</i>

1374
01:32:11,096 --> 01:32:13,129
<i>and very,
sort of content, and...</i>

1375
01:32:13,164 --> 01:32:14,735
<i>You seem at ease with yourself.</i>

1376
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:16,210
<i>I'm at ease with myself, yeah.</i>

1377
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:23,887
<i>You've always been so good</i>

1378
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:26,109
<i>at being convincing, you know?</i>

1379
01:32:26,144 --> 01:32:28,716
<i>- Whatever it was at the time.
- Yeah. I see.</i>

1380
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,685
<i>I mean, is it possible that this</i>

1381
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:34,282
<i>- is just another role?
- I see what's going on.</i>

1382
01:32:34,317 --> 01:32:36,691
<i>I believe that there is a thread</i>

1383
01:32:36,726 --> 01:32:38,924
<i>of meaning running
through my life at the moment,</i>

1384
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:40,695
<i>that I have no wish
at the moment to break,</i>

1385
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:42,059
<i>and I feel it's leading</i>

1386
01:32:42,094 --> 01:32:44,160
<i>somewhere fulfilling
and positive.</i>

1387
01:32:44,195 --> 01:32:47,064
<i>And if I feel that way,
then I make every effort</i>

1388
01:32:47,099 --> 01:32:49,671
<i>to make that part
of my music now.</i>

1389
01:32:54,205 --> 01:32:56,370
<i>It's the ultimate swing
of the pendulum.</i>

1390
01:32:56,405 --> 01:32:58,779
<i>When things reach a point
to one extreme,</i>

1391
01:32:58,814 --> 01:33:00,242
<i>there will be
a natural gravitation</i>

1392
01:33:00,277 --> 01:33:02,145
<i>back to a point,</i>

1393
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:04,114
<i>which is the antithesis
of that one.</i>

1394
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:06,149
<i>So, you've got
a musical vocabulary,</i>

1395
01:33:06,184 --> 01:33:10,252
<i>which is high-tech, and icy.</i>

1396
01:33:10,287 --> 01:33:13,222
<i>There's gonna be sooner
or later a swing back to,</i>

1397
01:33:13,257 --> 01:33:16,126
<i>well, what is the other side
of that coin?</i>

1398
01:33:16,161 --> 01:33:17,864
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. David Bowie.</i>

1399
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:26,235
I'd like to, um,
start off the 80s

1400
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:29,172
in a positive,
optimistic fashion.

1401
01:33:29,207 --> 01:33:32,076
I'll be undertaking,
a world tour,

1402
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:34,012
sometime around the middle
of the year,

1403
01:33:34,047 --> 01:33:38,016
and it'll take me through
to the autumn at least.

1404
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:40,084
And he's back. David Bowie,

1405
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:42,284
launching his
first new album in three years,

1406
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:45,221
preparing for his first
British tour in five years,

1407
01:33:45,256 --> 01:33:47,256
and telling Newsnight's
Robin Denselow

1408
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:50,292
<i>about his new
and more emotional music style.</i>

1409
01:33:51,867 --> 01:33:54,395
I'm trying to write
in a more obvious

1410
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,100
and positive manner.

1411
01:33:56,135 --> 01:33:59,301
I've not gone quite
into a corner

1412
01:33:59,336 --> 01:34:01,908
with experimentation of sound.

1413
01:34:01,943 --> 01:34:04,779
I'm not quite so concerned
with cut-up exercise,

1414
01:34:04,814 --> 01:34:07,276
or using juxtaposition
of lyrics, or whatever.

1415
01:34:07,311 --> 01:34:09,179
I'd like to do
something positive.

1416
01:34:09,214 --> 01:34:11,951
Something that helps people,
to use a cliche.

1417
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,734
<i>This is probably
the simplest music</i>

1418
01:34:14,758 --> 01:34:16,054
<i>I've ever done.</i>

1419
01:34:16,089 --> 01:34:17,396
<i>What do you mean simple?</i>

1420
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:20,223
<i>It makes very warm,</i>

1421
01:34:20,258 --> 01:34:22,192
<i>understandable
musical statements.</i>

1422
01:34:22,227 --> 01:34:24,095
<i>It has a warm response.</i>

1423
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:27,868
<i>I hope that it's the most
emotionally uplifting music</i>

1424
01:34:27,903 --> 01:34:29,936
<i>I've made in a long time.</i>

1425
01:34:29,971 --> 01:34:31,432
<i>It's very positive.</i>

1426
01:34:31,467 --> 01:34:33,137
<i>Is that how you're feeling?</i>

1427
01:34:33,172 --> 01:34:35,073
<i>Relatively. Oh yeah.</i>

1428
01:34:35,108 --> 01:34:36,404

02:00:33,401 --> 02:00:35,632
<i>of uncharted waters.</i>

1819
02:00:35,667 --> 02:00:38,305
<i>I put myself
through everything...</i>

1820
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:41,066
<i>Absolutely everything,
that came along.</i>

1821
02:00:41,101 --> 02:00:45,576
<i>It was very important for me
to expand my horizons</i>

1822
02:00:45,611 --> 02:00:47,314
<i>and seeing just how...</i>

1823
02:00:47,349 --> 02:00:49,712
<i>Just how near to the line
I could get.</i>

1824
02:01:30,722 --> 02:01:32,920
<i>I've been so eclectic
all my life.</i>

1825
02:01:32,955 --> 02:01:35,923
<i>I've been admiring
of so many different people</i>

1826
02:01:35,958 --> 02:01:37,958
<i>and so many different things
that they've done,</i>

1827
02:01:37,993 --> 02:01:41,797
<i>I feel that I owe so many
for the way that I think</i>

1828
02:01:41,832 --> 02:01:42,832
<i>and do things.</i>

1829
02:01:44,131 --> 02:01:47,836
<i>I guess anybody
who's had the integrity</i>

1830
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:50,377
<i>to kind of always work
outside of the system,</i>

1831
02:01:50,412 --> 02:01:52,511
<i>has always appealed to me.</i>

1832
02:01:52,546 --> 02:01:55,712
<i>Whenever I'm teetering
on sort of what I know</i>

1833
02:01:55,747 --> 02:01:58,550
<i>is what I do best,
and what I really feel for,</i>

1834
02:01:58,585 --> 02:02:00,717
<i>and there's an area
that I think that,</i>

1835
02:02:00,752 --> 02:02:02,983
<i>well, an audience
I know would like this,</i>

1836
02:02:03,953 --> 02:02:05,788
<i>I just remember back</i>

1837
02:02:05,823 --> 02:02:09,792
<i>to how much I hate the center
of the social strata,</i>

1838
02:02:09,827 --> 02:02:11,959
<i>how I hate being drawn
into the middle,</i>

1839
02:02:11,994 --> 02:02:14,434
<i>to the middle of the road
of anything,</i>

1840
02:02:14,469 --> 02:02:17,063
<i>to that which is most popular.</i>

1841
02:02:17,098 --> 02:02:19,098
<i>And if... The other thing
I would say is that</i>

1842
02:02:19,133 --> 02:02:21,936
<i>if you feel safe in the area
that you're working in,</i>

1843
02:02:21,971 --> 02:02:23,740
<i>you're not working
in the right area.</i>

1844
02:02:23,775 --> 02:02:25,940
<i>Always go a little further
into the water</i>

1845
02:02:25,975 --> 02:02:27,909
<i>than you feel
you're capable of being in.</i>

1846
02:02:27,944 --> 02:02:29,878
<i>Go a little bit
out of your depth,</i>

1847
02:02:29,913 --> 02:02:31,079
<i>and when you don't feel</i>

1848
02:02:31,114 --> 02:02:33,112
<i>that your feet
are quite touching the bottom,</i>
