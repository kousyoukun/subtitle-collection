800

直到现在

801
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,200
It appears that a retired Beekeeper

00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,850
Not unlike bees themselves,

810
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,460
Beekeepers keep working until they die.

811
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,250
So he's basically one of us.

If you were in the same room,

he would kill you.

I know they pollinate a bunch of shit
