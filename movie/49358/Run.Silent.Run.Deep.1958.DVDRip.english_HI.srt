- Mark?
- 1-5-0-0.

50 port. Open outer doors,
tubes 1 and 2. Stand by.

7
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,341
Open outer doors, 1 and 2. Stand by.

8
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,428
Open outer doors on 1 and 2. Stand by.

9
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,824
Firing two fish forward. Watch your depth.

10
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,862
Two degrees down bubble. Hold her at 60.

11
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,744
- Outer doors open on 1 and 2, sir.
- Final bearing.

12
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,066
- Mark.

Fire 1.

- 1 is fired, sir.
- Fire 2.

16

Fire 2.

17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,069
- 2 is fired, sir.
- Time on that first torpedo.

18
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,420
Should hit in about 42 seconds, sir.

19

<i>(explosion)</i>

24
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,223
Better hold on to these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.

25
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,944
- Why?
- His car had a flat tyre this morning.

26
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,345
Right rear. He's fit to be tied.

27
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,301
- Send 'em tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,990
Captain Field's a little touchy
this morning, too.

29
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,066
Oh? Another flat tyre?

30
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,103
Almost the same thing. His wife.
They had a quarrel last night.

31
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,380
- Oh, that.
- I'm ready for action.

32
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,944
Passing up the decoy, sir. In position.

33
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,220
Heading straight on towards the Akikaze.

34
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,420
- Stand by to dive.
- Aye aye, sir.

35
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,188
Range 1800.

36
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,949
Akikaze bearing down on us, bow on.

37
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,268
- Clear the bridge. Dive.
- Dive. Ready to shoot in 25 seconds.

38
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,142
Bearing. Mark.

39
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,544
Fire.

40
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,944
Fire 1.

41
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,503
24 seconds, sir.

42
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,349
Torpedo running hot, straight and normal.

43
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,581
You sunk him again, sir.

44
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,180
That makes 200 times
you've sunk Bungo Pete in...

45
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,583
...200 days.

46
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,543
- He only sunk you once!
- Just once.

47
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,626
But it wasn't on a desk.

48
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,860
Where do you get all these things?

49
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,141
- Oh, tables, desks.
- Mueller, you're a thief.

50
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,226
I'm a collector, sir.

51
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,899
Bungo Pete! Let's put him
next to his Akikaze destroyer.

52
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,988
The unknown factor.
The sea dragon of Area 7.

53
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,670
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area!

54
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,748
Too bad they'll never give <i>you</i>
another chance in that area.

55
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,020
Four submarines sunk
in the Bungo Straits...

56
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,904
...and they keep you behind a desk
for something <i>they</i> can't even figure out!

57
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,181
How many subs? You said four, I think.

58
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,509
- Yes, sir.
- The count was three a month ago.

59
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,908
It's only scuttlebutt, but the word's
around that the last boat sent out...

60
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,986
...was lost three days ago.

61
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,506
Get these things outta here!

62
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,622
Mueller...

63
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,706
...when's the next sub due in?

64
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,741
Two weeks, sir. The Nerka.

65
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,909
Her skipper was wounded, but
the Executive Officer's due to take over.

66
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,988
- He qualified for command?
- Yes, sir.

67
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,705
- They'll send her out to 7.
- I suppose so.

68
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,746
Get the Chief of Staff on the phone.
Tell him I'm coming over.

69
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,586
<i>(</i># <i>"Anchors Aweigh")</i>

70
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,141
<i>(PA) Executive Officer to duty section.</i>
<i>Now hear this.</i>

71
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,306
The repair crew will take over at 1300.

72
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,944
Duty section will stand by
with the repair list.

73
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,506
You beach boys who'll be checking in
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel...

74
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,860
...the hotel does not have a repair crew.

75
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,868
So have fun,
but keep the damage to a minimum.

76
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,543
Break it up, break it up!
Russo, Cullen, break it up! I...

77
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,499
For the next captain of the Nerka, sir.

78
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,383
What we mean to say, Mr Bledsoe...
Congratulations!

79
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,388
<i>(all)</i> Good luck, sir.

80
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,059
- So this is the way we start! Bribery!
- Don't know what you mean, sir!

81
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,626
Next it'll be special privileges!
Sunbathing, two-hour watches.

82
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,389
A sunburned crew is a happy crew!
An old Navy axiom!

83
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,466
That you just made up!

84
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,106
Thanks a lot, men. Don't any of you
get the idea I can be had!

85
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,425
- It never entered our heads!
- I'll bet!

86
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,860
- Go on, try it on, sir!
- You'll look very sharp in that rig!

87
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,979
- See you a moment, Bledsoe?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,260
Uh, we were just leaving, Captain.

89
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,381
I said we were leaving!

90
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,028
It's... sort of a gift, sir. The men, they...

91
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,106
It's all right. Never mind.

92
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,983
- Any milk left in the galley?
- Yes, sir.

93
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,544
- Oh, it's powdered, sir.
- That'll do.

94
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,308
She belongs to the chief of the boat.
Good-luck token.

95
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,184
The men give her a little... pat
on their way to battle stations.

96
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,062
Interesting.

97
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,146
I'll get the milk, sir.

98
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,026
Ah, submarines. They ruined my liver.

99
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,946
Couldn't take one again.

100
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,221
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique.

101
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,103
- Do you like subs?
- I chose the service, sir.

102
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,186
Of course.

103
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,546
- Good record.
- Thank you, sir.

104
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,423
It's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me!

105
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,304
I told you two years ago you were
hot stuff, that you'd have a sub one day.

106
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,580
- Remember?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

107
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,666
Well, you're going to, Jim.

108
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,621
But not this time out.

109
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,947
The Nerka is being assigned
to Commander Richardson.

110
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,459
He'll be your skipper for this patrol.

111
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,267
You see, Jim, she's going to Area 7.
Richardson is acquainted with the area.

112
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,621
7 is a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year.

113
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,742
All of 'em sunk by an Akikaze
off the Bungo Straits.

114
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,829
His sub was the first. The Navy Board
feels he deserves another chance.

115
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,386
That command was mine.
Don't they think I can handle her in 7?

116
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,308
Of course not.
Your ability isn't being questioned.

117
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,581
- Richardson's suggestion...
- Richardson's suggestion?

118
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,701
He presented a very strong case.

119
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,828
This whole thing
is suddenly very clear to me.

120
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,670
- That all, sir?
- That's all.

121
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,828
You won't mind if I keep this
out of mothballs, Captain?

122
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,510
There are other boats besides the Nerka.

123
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,428
Rich?

124
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,420
Rich? Hey, be careful!

125
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,462
- What's the matter?
- Like me to fix some lemonade?

126
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,548
Sure, honey, you go ahead.
I'll be down by the time...

127
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,103
- Better make enough for three.
- Three?

128
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,064
- We have company arriving.
- I can't see anyone like this!

129
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,306
I don't think this is a social visit.

130
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,664
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.

131
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,946
Looking for me?

132
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,499
- Commander Richardson?
- That's right.

133
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,586
I'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.

134
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,941
A pleasure. Mind throwing me up
that insect spray, Jim?

135
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,664
Excuse me, sir,
but I didn't come to spray insects.

136
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,703
Well, it's the leaves you spray.
But it doesn't matter.

137
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,819
- What's on your mind?
- A request, sir.

138
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,906
I'd like you to ask for another Exec.

139
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,986
Oh? Just like that, huh?

140
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,180
My privilege, sir. Navy regulations.

141
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,347
- I'd have to take it to the Board.
- You went to them before.

142
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,621
That's just it. I got what I wanted.
Why should I change it?

143
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,106
Maybe I can enlighten you.
The crew's accepted me as its captain.

144
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,982
They have me decked out as a groom.

145
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,182
Now you're taking my place,
I'd rather not go to the wedding.

146
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,541
Are we discussing your pride
or are you embarrassed to face them?

147
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,820
You'll be facing them in a couple of days.

148
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,499
The resentment's going to be
twice as great with me on board.

149
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,780
Mr Bledsoe, let me be honest with you.

150
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,344
I don't care about
their resentment or yours.

151
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,587
I wanted a boat. The Board gave it to me.
That's all there is.

152
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,462
The Board didn't give you a thing.

153
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,866
You went to them, the poor
desk commander with a tear in his eye.

154
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,347
You told them if you could have <i>me</i>
for a backstop, you could do the job.

155
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,426
Mr Bledsoe...

156
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,905
...your request for release is denied.

157
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,586
<i>(door opens)</i>

158
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,505
Well, Commander, I'm glad I came over.

159
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,259
- Get things straightened out.
- We're going to get along just fine.

160
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,063
Don't worry, Jim.
I'll take good care of the bride.

161
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,943
Anyone for a slug of gin?
We're out of vermouth.

162
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,220
- Lt Bledsoe, Laura. My Exec.
- Hello.

163
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,581
Thanks, Mrs Richardson.
I'll take a rain check on the drink.

164
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,429
- Some other time.
- Lieutenant?

165
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,018
If there isn't another time, good luck.

166
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,539
Take good care of my husband.

167
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,466
I'll take care, ma'am.

168
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,738
- Take over, Mr Conwell.
- Aye aye, sir.

169
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,708
Captain's off the bridge.
It won't be long now.

170
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,786
Captain's off the bridge.

171
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,663
- Order's coming up soon, Chief.
- OK, Carver.

172
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,066
- Is he downstairs yet?
- Below, Jessie. The Captain's below.

173
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,546
- How much is in the pool?
- 200 bucks. Are all the areas covered?

174
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,424
- I got a five spot on Area 22.
- 16 for me! I hear it's a pleasure cruise!

175
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,188
- I took 7.
- 7?

176
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,266
- You what?
- I took 7.

177
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,507
- That's a one-way ticket, idiot!
- Trying to jinx us all?

178
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,589
- What do you mean, one-way?
- No return, Jessie. No return.

179
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,579
But I was born on the 7th.
What with all that money in the pool, I...

180
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,270
7 is lucky for me... ain't it?

181
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,300
The money's all locked up inside.

182
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,422
Wilson, tell the engine room
we're standing by.

183
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,508
- Hey, Chief, can I change areas?
- Too late.

184
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,780
Gentlemen, I ask for silence.

185
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,060
The next voice you hear...

186
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,146
...will be the dealer.

187
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,347
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

188
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,826
<i>I know all of you are vitally interested</i>
<i>in our area assignment.</i>

189
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,183
Here is a rundown of the orders under
which we will operate during this patrol.

190
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,187
Number one.

191
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,065
<i>And I'm sure you've heard this</i>
<i>many times: Sink enemy shipping.</i>

192
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,628
<i>Number two: Proceed</i>
<i>on a specified course to Area 7...</i>

193
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,584
- I knew it! I just knew it!
- For Pete's sake, turn it off!

194
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,467
Number three: Avoid the section
in Area 7 known as the Bungo Straits.

195
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,225
<i>Number four: Take coast intelligence</i>
<i>photos wherever possible.</i>

196
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,343
<i>A third of you are new men, and I know</i>
<i>there are bound to be some questions.</i>

197
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,462
<i>Feel free to ask</i>
<i>your division officer any time.</i>

198
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,058
<i>That's all. Thanks for your attention.</i>

199
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,226
Hey, where are the Bungo Straits?

200
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,306
- Why?
- He said we'll avoid it.

201
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,990
He didn't say anything about avoiding 7.

202
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,749
OK, give everyone back
his money, Kohler.

203
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,304
No dice. Somebody took Area 7.

204
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,388
- Who?
- <i>He</i> did.

205
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,422
Jeez, fellas, I didn't know!
Well, it's my birthday!

206
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,222
7's my birthday!

207
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,621
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.

208
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,379
<i>(Jim) Range 2,000.</i>
<i>All hands standing by for drill.</i>

209
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,070
Bail out. Lookouts, below!

210
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,786
Clear the bridge!

211
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,700
<i>(klaxon)</i>

212
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,786
Dive! Dive!

213
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,824
- What's the depth?
- 38 feet, sir.

214
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,659
- Ruby, where's the scope?
- We're not at periscope depth yet.

215
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,509
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface!

216
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,586
Now let's get this straight.

217
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,419
- I want this scope up as we dive.
- As we dive, sir?

218
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,110
I wanna be ready to fire
once we level off at 50 feet.

219
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,501
I know this is new to you,
but you'll have to get used to it.

220
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,589
The purpose of this drill is
to dive and fire as soon as we level.

221
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,940
Let's try it again. Surface!

222
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,139
<i>(klaxon)</i>

223
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,943
Blow main ballast. Hard rise on planes.

224
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,906
<i>(klaxon)</i>

225
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,140
- Blow negative!
- Level off. 8-degree angle,

226
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,228
- Depth: 40 feet.
- Steady on course, Captain.

227
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,422
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1. Time?

228
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,108
42 seconds, sir.

229
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,188
- Not fast enough. Open the vents sooner.
- Aye aye, sir.

230
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,666
- Stand by to surface. We'll try it again.
- Stand by to surface.

<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,941
- Open the vents on the diving alarm.
- Taking a chance, isn't it?

234
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,823
You can always shut 'em
if you don't get a green board.

235
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,508
Aye aye, sir.

<i>(klaxon)</i>

237
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,628
Dive! Dive!

238
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,469
Open 'em up! Flood those tanks!

<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

241
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,385
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1.

242
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,901
- 37 seconds, sir.
- That's good. Very good.

243
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,703
By the time we reach Area 7,
I want it down to 33.

244
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,786
- 33, sir?
- 33 is right.

245
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,743
- Yes, sir. Secure from battle stations?
- Yes, Jim.

246
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,260
- Take the conn, Mr Cartwright.
- Secure from battle stations.

247
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,383
- Secure. Third section, take watch.
- Secure. Third section, take watch.

248
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,466
All ahead one third.

249
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,546
Light the smoking lamp.

250
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,304
I said secure. Your tails
can't be dragging that much.

251
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,149
What's the matter? No gripes, no groans?

252
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,342
Isn't anyone gonna say
it's a four-second difference?

253
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,426
Not a boat in the fleet could make it?

254
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,427
Ruby, you worried about drills?

255
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,386
- No, sir.
- Poplin?

256
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,389
I never keep anything from a crew. I don't
expect 'em to keep anything from me.

257
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,989
So, come on, speak up!

258
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,585
Well, I... I guess it's...
It's Area 7, Mr Bledsoe.

259
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,463
- You heard the operation orders.
- That's just it, sir.

260
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,866
- They mentioned the Bungo Straits.
- What difference does that make?

261
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,744
That's the section where
those subs were lost - the graveyard.

262
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,543
- We've got orders to avoid it.
- The Bungo Straits!

263
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,661
- Well, for Pete's sake!
- Great!

264
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,509
- Lieutenant, we thought...
- Don't think.

265
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,940
Grab some coffee.
In 30 minutes, you got another drill.

266
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,503
33 seconds!

267
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,508
Leave the hatch open,
the boat might go down faster.

268
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,586
<i>(men continue banter)</i>

269
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,426
I heard you, Lieutenant.

270
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,064
Now that you've explained the orders...

271
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,262
...how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?

272
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,742
<i>(alarm)</i>

273
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,542
Captain to the bridge!

274
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,826
Easy, fellas! She's gotta last the patrol!
One pat to a customer now!

275
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,189
- All ahead, standard on board.
- OK, I got it.

276
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,507
Radar contact dead astern, sir.
We think it's a Jap sub.

277
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,268
Has he seen us?

278
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,462
Hard to tell. Shall we open
the outer doors on the stern tubes?

279
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,546
No. Keep her on present course.

280
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,626
<i>(alarm continues)</i>

281

Conning tower,
aft engine room manned and ready.

282
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,024
Conn, forward torpedo room
manned and ready.

283
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,505
How long shall we hold this course, sir?

284
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,779
What?

285
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,946
Before we double back to get 'em.

286
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,061
We're not going to double back.

287
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,548
- Sir?
- He might get lucky. I'm not risking it.

288
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,901
- We're faster. We could outmanoeuvre it.
- Hold her steady.

289
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,703
- Aye aye, sir.
- Keep a sharp lookout astern!

290
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,390
<i>Lost radar contact at 6-5-0-0 yards, sir.</i>

291
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,229
Very well. Secure from battle stations.

292
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,306
Secure from battle stations.

293
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,898
Second section, take the watch.

294
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,346
I'll take the conn. Lay below.

295
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,426
Aye aye, sir.

296
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,625
Well, you've had the boat for a week now.

297
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,548
I guess you noticed
how quickly she responds.

298
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,982
Always a shudder when you push her
too hard. Best to ease her into it.

299
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,068
- Thanks. Anything else?
- Just one thing, sir.

300
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,819
She hates showing her backsides
to Japanese submarines.

301
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,146
Permission to go below, sir?

302
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,226
Granted.

303
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,188
Now hear this, now hear this.
Orders of the day.

304
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,462
To your sacks, men. You've got
25 seconds to lay flat on your backs.

305
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,058
Any of you gripers want a sleeping pill?

306
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,750
He's a caution. Isn't he a caution!

307
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,020
Give the skipper a couple, will ya?

308
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,063
A Jap sub and all these drills.
The Captain must be running scared.

309
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,341
Aw, it's the craziest war patrol
I ever started on.

310
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,429
Who said anything about a war patrol?
You're all confused, my friend.

311
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,702
We're on a drill patrol. First time
in the annals of the Navy Department.

312
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,266
What's it all mean?
What's he got in mind, huh?

313
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,826
Haven't you heard? He's gonna
challenge the Japs to a drill.

314
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,181
The winner will get
an all-expense-paid honeymoon...

315
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,778
...with Tokyo Rose in the Bungo Straits.

316
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,222
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate.
Let us pay tribute to that great motto.

317
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,342
"Caution with safety
and safety with caution."

318
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,426
Now. Let's do better than that.

319
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,986
Let's drink a toast to our beloved captain,
the drillmaster!

320
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,102
For he knew our fleet boat
was faster than a Jap sub.

321
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,982
I've had enough kidding, Jerry.

322
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,578
Why? A cautious captain
with orders to "avoid"?

323
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,508
If we stay out of Area 7
as well as the Straits, we're in.

324
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,066
- I bet he's thinking of a way now!
- Excuse me, sir. Your watch list.

325
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,863
What about that, Mueller?
You're chummy with him.

326
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,539
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr Cartwright. Do you, sir?

327
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,468
Come back here, Kraut!

328
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,581
Get out, Mueller. Go on.

329
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,184
If you have any questions, you come
to me, not the crew. Understand?

330
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,268
And that goes for your opinions, too.

331
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,580
Maybe we'd better break this up.
It's getting late.

332
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,986
Shut up.

- I'm all right, sir. I'm OK.

345
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,228
Who gave you permission
to dump the garbage?

346
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,228
- Mr Cartwright, sir.
- I thought he'd asked the OD.

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,659
- I was on the bridge. I...
- Get below.

348
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,348
Yes, sir.

349
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,187
Only the captain gives permission
to dump the trash.

350
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,939
Instead of losing time on this drill,
we almost lose a man!

351
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,306
Stand by to dive!

352
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,227
- Check the watch, Mr Kohler.
- Aye aye, sir.

353
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,266
Mr Bledsoe.

354
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,548
Yes, sir?

355
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,980
- Have you been with this boat long?
- Over a year, sir.

356
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,941
And is this the kind of cooperation
you usually get?

357
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,988
No, sir.

358
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,180
A man could've been killed today.

359
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,189
The responsibility is yours.
You're in charge of the drills.

360
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,189
I have no excuses. But under the
circumstances, the crew did their best.

361
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,266
- What circumstances?
- Don't press it.

362
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,539
I want an answer.

363
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,821
It's one thing to drill a crew.
But when you duck a Jap sub...

364
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,023
...they wonder why they should care when
the Captain has no stomach for attacking.

365
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,505
Does he want obedience, efficiency...

366
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,019
...or the best-drilled cowards in the Navy?

367
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,342
Mr Bledsoe, tell them I'm doubling
the drills, starting tomorrow.

368
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,028
Yes, sir.

369
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,710
You might as well know, sir.
I don't believe it.

370
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,183
Believe what?

371
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,268
That you ran away from that sub
from cowardice.

372
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,023
I know what ya mean, but what's the cook
supposed to do - eat the garbage?

- Calm, you know. No excitement.

Just like you'd order ham and eggs!

Jessie! Jessie, dear friend!

477
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,861
We've decided to be big about it.

478
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,300
We're not gonna hold you responsible
for Area 7 any longer.

479
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,580
- We'll take back the money.
- Gosh!

480
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,940
Well, that's nice of you fellas...

481
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,699
...but my conscience hurt me so much,
I threw it overboard.

482
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,300
- Not now, Kohler.
- Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.

483
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,987
I've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen 'em together.

484
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,385
But I never saw one
run away from a Jap sub...

485
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,059
...then take on a destroyer with a shot
I didn't even know was in the book.

486
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,146
There has to be a reason.

487
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,866
That bow shot didn't just happen.

488
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,743
The drills were planned for it.
The whole thing was...

489
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,428
<i>(door closes)</i>

490
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,426
I never heard of a bow shot
being set up except in desperation.

491
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,506
It's all like some experiment.

492
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,259
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he thought he could get an Akikaze.

493
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,143
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a helluva difference.

494
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,579
This Akikaze's in the Bungo Straits.

495
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,861
But that's impossible!
The orders say to avoid it!

496
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,906
I know.

497
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,979
Look, I know how you feel about him
taking the boat and all.

498
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,864
But don't you think
you're working at it overtime, sir?

499
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,629
We'll be hitting Area 7 tomorrow morning.

...six.

504
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,580
It's a convoy all right, sir.
Bearing 3-2-0 relative.

505
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,940
Sounds like a whole lot of 'em, sir.

506
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,346
- Cullen.
- Aye aye, sir.

507
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,426
I have the dive. Depth: 60 feet.

508
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,020
- Forward torpedo room ready, sir.
- We're undetected, sir.

509
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,106
Aft torpedo room manned and ready.

510
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,586
We're dead ahead of the convoy.
What firing position shall we take?

511
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,582
Captain?

512
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,586
Take her down, sir?

513
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,906
Take her down to 100 feet.

514
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,986
100 feet. Aye aye, sir.

515
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,149
Five degrees down bubble.
Take her to 100 feet.

516
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,023
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.

517
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,506
- Come right to course 2-8-0.
- Right to course 2-8-0, sir.

518
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,144
Very well. Mr Cartwright,
take over the conn.

519
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,419
Yes, sir.

520
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,660
What's he doing? What's going on?

521
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,259
- Give me a line on course 2-8-0.
- Sir?

522
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,143
- A line on course 2-8-0 now!
- Aye aye, sir.

523
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,068
- What's the skipper up...
- Later, Beckman.

524
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,819
- Start levelling off.
- Aye aye, sir.

525
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,938
There it is. You might as well post it.

526
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,382
A whole area to patrol and you pick
the graveyard - the Bungo Straits!

527
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,829
It's the only place we can get the Akikaze.

528
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,906
The one spot you're ordered to avoid.

529
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,942
You make it sound like
a snap decision. It wasn't.

530
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,109
That's quite obvious. Passing
a Jap submarine to save your torpedoes.

531
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,779
Risking a bow shot. Ducking a convoy
so they can't radio our position.

532
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,300
You planned it, all right! You knew it
the day I came to your house!

533
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,184
I knew it before that, Jim. I knew it
a year ago when my boat went down.

534
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,622
We have explicit orders. We have a crew
that expects the captain to follow them!

535
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,105
You know that a captain
can redefine orders...

536
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,186
...if he feels he has an advantage.

537
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,540
- What advantage?
- You named it. A bow shot.

538
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,900
We did it with a Momo.
We can do it again.

539
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,069
You call that an advantage when
four subs before us never had a chance?

540
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,068
They were detected.
Not even Pearl knows where we are.

541
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,146
What about the Japanese navy?

542
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,262
No, sir, that's no advantage.
Not in <i>my</i> book.

543
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,346
But you're not the captain.

544
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,830
If you should fail
but come out of this alive...

545
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,987
...there won't be a desk
small enough for you this time!

546
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,785
That's strange, Jim.
I never even thought of failing.

547
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,778
You've got a lot of guts, sir,
with other people's lives.

548
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,060
That's my decision and my responsibility!

549
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,181
To whom? To a crew
that died a year ago?

550
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,870
Yes! To a dead crew, a dead sub!

551
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,306
Now, believe what you want.

552
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,546
Well, this crew's still alive.

553
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,868
They have a right to know where
they're going. Do I have to tell them?

554
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,744
What's the matter? Surely
you've got guts enough for this, too.

555
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,306
This is the Captain.

556
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,990
Due to conditions of special advantage...

557
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,500
...I have decided to take this boat
to the Bungo Straits.

558
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,181
Bungo Straits, broad on the port beam.

559
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,026
We're there.

560
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,026
Bungo Straits.

561
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,746
We're at the Straits.

562
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,666
Bungo Straits.

563
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,502
Bungo Straits.

564
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,542
Bungo Straits.

565
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,185
We're there. We're in the Straits.

566
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,780
If I'd only been born on the 8th.

567
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,346
Uh, see you a moment, sir?

568
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,706
- What is this?
- We, uh... want to talk to you, Jim.

569
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,902
- I looked through the Navy rules.
- We want you to take over.

570
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,225
That's very flattering, gentlemen.

571
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,102
Let's go. Everyone outside.

572
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,266
- They're Navy orders!
- What right...

573
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,585
A captain's right. That's all he needs.

574
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,666
We might as well
make up our minds now.

575
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,509
- We'll follow his orders.
- Where? To the bottom?

576
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,383
If that's what he's got in mind,
that's where we'll go.

577
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,865
This boat - any boat - has one captain.

578
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,746
Is that right, Kohler?

579
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,262
Yes, sir.

580
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,746
- Is that right, Mr Cartwright?
- Yes, sir.

581
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,826
Let's break this up.

582
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,746
Mr Cartwright, with all due respect
to your rank...

583
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,430
...may I say that I think you're an ass?

584
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,459
I see by this report that
you called Mr Cartwright an ass.

585
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,546
- Yes, sir.
- An officer?

586
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,422
That's right, sir.

587
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,747
- Mueller, you're a damn fool.
- Yes, sir, I know.

588
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,021
But as long as I overheard,
you might as well know, too.

589
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,948
They wanted Mr Bledsoe to take over.

590
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,630
- He put an end to that fast.
- He would.

591
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,345
- Would you tell me something?
- If I can, sir.

592
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,462
- Am I a damn fool, too?
- Sir?

593
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:50,061
Mr Bledsoe seems to think I am,
and I have a great respect for his opinion.

594
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,341
Maybe you have to be, Captain,
to do something like this.

595
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,019
You nailed that Momo with a bow shot.
Why not the Akikaze?

596
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,347
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller. Never.

597
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,825
Well, he will this time, sir.

598
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,659
Is that a classified opinion
or am I at liberty to repeat it?

599
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,746
It's a fact, sir.

600
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,101
A fact they'll all realise
at Bungo Pete's funeral!

Are we gonna set up
on the leading ship, sir?

605
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,389
That's a decoy. Shallow craft.
Used to draw fire away from the convoy.

606
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,066
You could shoot ten fish.
They'd only run under it.

607
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,668
There! There she is,
pulling up to the convoy!

608
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,542
- The Akikaze.
- Yes.

609
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,423
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.

610
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,462
Look at her cut through there!
Must be making 30 knots!

611

Doesn't stay in position long enough
to give you a target.

612
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,586
Not unless he's coming toward you.

613
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,988
Take over in the conning tower. Track
the next-to-last ship in the port column.

614
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,022
We'll give you a bearing.
Right standard rudder!

00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,106
Very well.

616
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,341
This is the Captain. The convoy we've
been waiting for is on our starboard bow.

617
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,782
<i>The plan of attack is as follows.</i>
<i>First, we'll strike a freighter going in.</i>

618
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,663
<i>If that doesn't bring</i>
<i>the Akikaze toward us...</i>

<i>... we'll attack the freighter nearest him.</i>

620
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,338
<i>When the Akikaze does head toward us,</i>
<i>we'll dive and give him two fish...</i>

621
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,700
<i>... at 1500 yards, just like the Momo.</i>

622
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,786
Let's go! All ahead standard.

623
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,787
- All ahead standard, sir.
- Very well.

624
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,149
How's the target course
and speed check with the TDC?

625
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,738
Course checks. Speed, one knot slower.

01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:19,059
- How long have I been out?
- Just a few minutes, Captain.

758
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,706
No.

759
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,744
You'd better worry about yourself.
You'll be in for a rough time.

760
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,226
Hendrix knows his stuff.
You've had a pretty bad concussion.

761
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,228
It's worse than that.
There's a medical term for it...

762
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:38,423
...but it all adds up to blacking out
now and then for quite a while.

763
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,180
If you don't keep off your feet, sir,
you'll be blacking out permanently!

764
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:49,266
- You'll keep this to yourselves.
- But, sir...

765
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,346
That's an order, Hendrix.

766
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,306
Send for Mr Bledsoe.

767
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,264
- Well, go on!
- Yes, sir.

768
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,899
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.

769
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,624
We'll have to set up
a jury-rig for the radio...

770
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,059
...and the radar needs some work, too.

771
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,146
That's another 24 hours.

772
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:44,503
Not bad, considering. We'll lay over
for two days, then we can get moving.

773
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:49,579
Yeah, the timing's perfect.
Those convoys come out every 48 hours.

774
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,541
- You really got shook up, didn't you?
- No.

775
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:58,743
- No, I couldn't feel better.
- Then maybe I didn't hear you right.

776
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,021
You heard me right.
I'm talking about the Straits.

777
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,584
Going back to the Bungo Straits.

778
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,108
We're through playing with lives.
It's the end of the line.

779
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,300
Why? Because a torpedo went wild?

780
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,785
You know that's 100 to 1, an accident.

781
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:21,506
The whole Japanese air force...
dropping everything it's got.

782
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,623
- That's an accident, too?
- Next time around, we'll make it.

783
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,944
What are you gonna do? Swim back
to the Straits or use a lifeboat?

784
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,948
Because that's all the help
you're gonna get.

785
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:38,748
Those are tall words.
You'd better stop and think a minute.

786
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:43,022
I have thought about it. That wasn't
a tea party the crew held before.

787
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:46,745
They wanted me to take over then.
They'll feel the same way now.

788
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:51,182
You make one move to take over and,
I swear, I'll see that you're hung!

789
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:55,462
Then we'll hang together. Orders
were disobeyed. No more technicalities.

790
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:59,344
A fleet boat of the Navy,
a sub with her fighting power intact...

791
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,426
...and you'd take her back to Pearl?

792
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:03,188
I don't believe it!

793
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,866
Mr Cartwright!

794
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,346
Yes, sir?

795
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,224
We'll lay over two days for repairs
before returning to Pearl.

796
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,102
I'll be in command.

797
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,380
Get a detail started right away.

798
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,707
- Yes, sir.
- That's all, Cartwright.

799
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,106
Yes, sir.

800
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:39,749
The best Exec I could get
in the whole Navy!

801
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,826
The backstop, I think you said!

802
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:46,023
And the first command you give
as a captain is to order a retreat!

803
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,749
# Goodbye, Bungo! Hello, Pearl!

804
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:15,828
- Funny, funny, funny!
- Aw, what's with you?

805
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,020
We're trying to eat. Knock it off.

806
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,460
- Is this a private dining room?
- Wanna sing? Go to the head!

807
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,058
It'll take more than <i>you</i> to put me there!

808
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,988
Break it up!
What's the matter with you guys?

809
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:29,419
We're going back to Pearl, aren't we?

810
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,101
How many patrols have you had,
Mr Sears Roebuck?

811
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:38,586
- This is my second.
- Well, I've had five since '42.

812
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,861
I've taken depth charges,
shells, strafings...

813
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,743
...even a bombing run off the Solomons.

814
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:49,148
This is the first time I've gone back
to Pearl with 15 torpedoes still aboard.

815
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,910
Kohler, better start the torpedo check.

816
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,021
- Aye aye, sir.
- Mr Cartwright?

817
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,710
- Do you think we could've had 'im?
- What?

818
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,390
Suppose that fish hadn't gone wild, sir.

819
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:04,742
You think that aircraft was playing
games? The Japs had us detected.

820
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,338
- The Captain said...
- He's flat on his back.

821
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,859
Be better if somebody
had put him there sooner.

822
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,504
- Kohler, get started.
- Mr Cartwright...

823
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,985
This time words just fail me!

824
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,710
- It's this way, sir. I...
- Why didn't you stop it?

825
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,583
- I didn't know it was gonna happen.
- You let it go on.

826
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,826
- No, sir...
- Then it didn't happen?

827
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,510
If I have to put every crew member
on report, I will!

828
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,586
It was my fault, sir.

829
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,101
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the OD you're on report.

830
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,946
- Sir...
- What did you say?

831
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:44,585
I told you once
to keep your opinions to yourself!

832
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,666
Now get out of here!

833
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,746
Yes, sir.

834
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:55,786
I'm not going to stand for
any fighting or insubordination.

835
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:59,903
If you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken! You hear?

836
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:06,939
Wow! How about that?
Chewing out an officer in front of us!

837
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:11,029
He was chewing us all out.
What's he so sore at us for?

838
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:14,101
<i>(band music on radio)</i>

839
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,588
- Turn it up a bit, huh?
- It's OK. Let's leave it.

840
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,509
What are you trying to do -
break the plate?

841

<i>I play the music for the wives and</i>

<i>The Nerka has been sunk.</i>

<i>You'll never see them again.</i>

They even named us!
The officers, the crew!

855
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,626
How could they possibly know?

856
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,382
- Welsh?
- Yes, sir?

857
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,263
Were any messages sent
after we entered Area 7?

858
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,348
No, sir. We cut off all transmission.
Captain's orders.

859
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,542
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat?

860
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,626
That's right, sir.

861
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:40,786
Mueller!

862
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,903
Yes, sir?

863
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:45,590
Did you ever sign your name
"Kraut" Mueller?

864
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:49,066
Only on that notice I put up
about the Momo destroyer.

865
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:53,822
Russo?

866
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,100
- Where's Russo?
- Yes, sir?

867
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,983
The trash you put in the sacks -
how do you weight it?

868
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:02,546
- How do you weight it? Answer me!
- Tin cans, broken tools.

869
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,901
- Anything I can find to weight it down.
- Does it sink?

870
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,986
- I think so, sir.
- You <i>think</i> so?

871
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:10,465
Well, I can't say for certain, Mr Bledsoe.

872
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:12,740
Did you dump any sacks off the Straits?

873
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:14,826
Yes, sir.

874
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,346
What have I done now?

875
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,946
How do you feel?

876
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:28,822
I'm all right.

877
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,942
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.

878
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,823
- The crew must be very happy.
- Uh-huh.

879
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:40,068
Aren't you?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

880
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,066
That's what I wanted.

881
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:48,226
I see.

882
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:52,461
- You're going back to the Straits.
- That's right.

883
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,546
What changed your mind?

884
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,661
I found out how they detected us.

885
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:00,339
Those fishing barges along the coast
have been picking up our garbage.

886
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:03,621
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.

887
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,502
Sure, Jim.

888
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,586
I made the same speech.

889
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:11,988
But you and I both know that
the odds are still against us.

890
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:15,864
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.

891
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,826
Let's not kid ourselves.

892
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,022
You're going back
because you've been through it...

893
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,106
...because you <i>have</i> to go back.

894
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,666
You knew all along I would.

895
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:32,625
Let's say I had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.

896
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,986
OK, Rich.

897
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:42,101
I guess the real reason I came in here
was to tell you that I...

898
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,027
Good luck, Jim.

899
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:27,062
We know they think we're sunk. There's
no way for them to know we're here.

900
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:30,341
Every angle has been covered
except the risk of battle.

901
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,620
We're gonna make that risk pay off.

902
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,386
Any more questions?

903
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,219
There must be something you wanna ask.

904
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,500
Well, sir, we all thought...

905
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,862
Would you mind
