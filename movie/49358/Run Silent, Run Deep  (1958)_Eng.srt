1
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,059
Setup on leading freighter.

2
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,785
Range.

3
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:16,622
- Mark?
- 1500.

4
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:20,585
Fifty port. Open outer doors,
tubes one and two. Stand by.

5
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:22,587
Open outer doors, tubes one and two.
Stand by.

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,047
Open outer doors on one and two.
Stand by.

7
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,763
Firing two fish forward. Watch your depth.

8
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:35,725
Two degrees down bubble. Hold her at 60.

9
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,828
Outer doors open on
tubes one and two, sir.

10
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,145
Final bearing.

11
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:43,357
- Mark.
- 320.

12
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,110
- Set.
- Fire one.

13
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:47,320
Fire one.

14
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,406
- One is fired, sir.
- Fire two.

15
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,532
Fire two.

16
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:54,911
- Two is fired, sir.
- Time on that first torpedo.

17
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:57,163
Should hit in about 42 seconds, sir.

18
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:17,308
Crash dive! 300 feet! All ahead full!
Got a destroyer coming in fast!

19
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,143
Rig for depth charge. Silent running.

20
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,946
- Rig for depth charge. Silent running.
- Time!

21
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,147
Ten, nine, eight,

22
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,982
seven, six...

23
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:22,099
We'd better hold on to these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.

24
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:24,935
- Why?
- His car had a flat tire this morning.

25
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:27,313
Right rear. He's fit to be tied.

26
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,315
- Send 'em tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,068
Captain Field's a little touchy
this morning, too.

28
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,111
Another flat tire?

29
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:38,157
Almost the same thing. His wife, sir.
They had a quarrel last night.

30
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:41,118
- That.
- I'm ready for action.

31
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:43,746
Passing up the decoy, sir. In position.

32
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,082
Heading straight on towards the Akikazes.

33
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:48,042
- Stand by to dive.
- Aye, aye, sir.

34
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,919
Range, 1,800.

35
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,838
Akikaze bearing down on us, bow on.

36
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:57,343
- Clear the bridge. Dive.
- Dive. Ready to shoot in 25 seconds, sir.

37
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,762
Bearing. Mark.

38
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:00,888
Fire.

39
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,139
Fire one.

40
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,974
Twenty-four seconds, sir.

41
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,852
Torpedo running hot, straight and normal.

42
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,814
You sunk him again, sir.

43
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,026
That makes 200 times
you sunk Bungo Pete in...

44
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,364
Two hundred days. He only sunk you once.

45
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,282
Just once.

46
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:22,326
But it wasn't on a desk.

47
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,330
Where do you get all these things anyway?

48
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,583
- Tables, desks.
- Mueller, you're a thief.

49
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,669
I'm a collector, sir.

50
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,798
Bungo Pete! Let's put him next
to his Akikaze destroyer.

51
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:38,592
The unknown factor.
The Sea Dragon of Area 7.

52
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:41,846
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area.

53
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:44,849
Too bad they'll never give you
another chance in that area, Commander.

54
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,685
Holy smokes.
Four submarines sunk in the Bungo Straits,

55
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,687
and they keep you behind a desk for a year,

56
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,397
for something they can't even
figure out themselves.

57
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:55,025
How many subs? You said four, I think.

58
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,112
- Yes, sir.
- The count was three a month ago.

59
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,717
Well, it's only scuttlebutt, Commander,

60
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,869
but the word's around that the last boat
sent out there was lost three days ago.

61
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:09,582
Get these things out of here.

62
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,045
Mueller,

63
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,715
when is the next sub due in?

64
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,342
Two weeks, sir. The Nerka.

65
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:24,805
Her skipper was wounded, but the
executive officer is due to take over.

66
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,432
He qualified for command?

67
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:27,516
Yes, sir.

68
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,560
They'll send her out to 7.

69
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,021
I suppose so.

70
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,566
Get the Chief of Staff on the phone.

71
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,775
Tell him I'm coming over.

72
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,088
Executive Officer to the Duty Section.
Now hear this.

73
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:00,382
The repair crew will take over at 1300.

74
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:03,010
Duty Section will stand by
with a repair list.

75
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,931
You beach boys who will be checking
in at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel,

76
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,600
the hotel does not have a repair crew.

77
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,852
So have fun,
but keep the damage to a minimum.

78
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,862
Break it up! Russo! Cullen!
Break it up, I...

79
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:26,367
For the next captain of the Nerka, sir.

80
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:30,079
What we mean to say,
Mr. Bledsoe, congratulations.

81
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:31,580
Good luck, Captain.

82
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,791
Good luck, sir.

83
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,876
So this is the way we start, huh? Bribery!

84
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,044
Don't know what you mean, sir.

85
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,796
Next thing you know,
it'll be special privileges.

86
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,714
Sunbathing on the deck,
two-hour watches...

87
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,467
A sunburned crew's a happy crew, sir.
It's an old Navy axiom.

88
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,427
That you just made up!

89
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,268
Thanks a lot, men.

90
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,811
Don't any of you get the idea I can be had!

91
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,646
- The thought never entered our heads, sir.
- I'll bet!

92
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,898
- Go on, try it on, sir.
- Yeah, come on.

93
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,063
You'll look mighty sharp on that bridge,
Mr. Bledsoe!

94
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,820
Looks great!

95
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,989
See you a moment, Bledsoe?

96
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:06,198
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,242
We were just leaving, Captain.

98
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,828
I said we were leaving!

99
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,669
It's a sort of a gift, sir.
The men, they...

100
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,629
It's all right. Never mind.

101
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,048
- Any milk left in the galley?
- Yes, sir.

102
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,175
It's powdered, sir.

103
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:26,510
That'll do.

104
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,159
She belongs to the chief of the boat.

105
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,389
Good luck token.

106
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:33,976
The men give her a pat
on their way to battle stations.

107
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,686
Interesting.

108
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,479
I'll get the milk, sir.

109
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:44,778
Submarines.

110
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:46,405
They ruined my liver!

111
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,241
Couldn't take one again.

112
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,161
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique!

113
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,538
You like subs?

114
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,873
I chose the service, sir.

115
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,374
Yes, of course.

116
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:05,049
- Good record.
- Thank you, sir.

117
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:08,010
It's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me.

118
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,471
I told you two years ago
you were pretty hot stuff,

119
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,889
that you'd have a sub one day.

120
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,058
- Remember?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

121
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,727
Well, you're going to, Jim,

122
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,103
but not this time out.

123
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,940
The Nerka is being
assigned to Commander Richardson.

124
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,443
He'll be your skipper for this patrol.

125
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,406
You see, Jim, she's going to Area 7,

126
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,992
and Richardson's acquainted with the area.

127
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:36,288
7's a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year,

128
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:39,249
all of them sunk
by an Akikaze off the Bungo Straits.

129
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:43,712
His sub was the first. The Navy Board feels
he deserves another chance now.

130
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,589
That command was mine, sir.

131
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:47,424
Don't they think I can handle her in 7?
Is that it?

132
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,427
Of course not, Jim.
Your ability isn't being questioned here.

133
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,739
It's just that Richardson's suggestion...

134
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:56,100
- Richardson's suggestion?
- He presented a very strong case.

135
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,773
This whole thing is
suddenly very clear to me.

136
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:05,067
That all, sir?

137
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,443
That's all.

138
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,076
You won't mind
if I keep this out of mothballs, Captain.

139
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,828
There are other boats besides the Nerka.

140
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,290
Rich?

141
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:24,086
Rich? Hey, be careful!

142
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,295
What's the matter?

143
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,464
Thought you might like me
to fix some lemonade.

144
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:29,967
Sure, honey, you go ahead. I'll be down...

145
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,182
Better make enough for three.

146
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,475
Three?

147
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:40,185
We have company arriving.

148
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,771
I can't see anyone like this!

149
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:45,065
I don't think this is a social visit.

150
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:49,987
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.

151
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,532
Looking for me?

152
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,831
Commander Richardson?

153
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:01,999
That's right.

154
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,417
I'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.

155
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:05,002
Well, a pleasure!

156
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,629
Would you mind
throwing me up that insect spray, Jim?

157
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,873
Excuse me, sir,
but I didn't come here to spray insects.

158
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:12,426
Well, it's the leaves you spray.

159
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,844
But it doesn't matter.

160
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,474
- What's on your mind?
- A request, sir.

161
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,684
I'd like you to ask for another exec.

162
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:25,147
- Just like that, huh?
- My privilege, sir. Navy regulations.

163
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:27,691
Well, I'd have to take it to the Board.

164
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:28,859
You went to them before.

165
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:32,237
That's just it. I got what I wanted then.
Why should I change it?

166
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:33,781
Maybe I can enlighten you.

167
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:36,241
There's a crew
that's already accepted me as its captain.

168
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:38,410
They have me decked out as the groom.

169
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:41,038
Now that you're taking my
place, I'd rather not go the wedding.

170
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:42,706
Are we discussing your pride,

171
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,583
or are you embarrassed to face them?

172
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,877
You'll be facing them yourself
in a couple of days.

173
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:49,963
The resentment's going
to be twice as great with me on board.

174
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:53,217
Mr. Bledsoe, let me be honest with you.

175
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:56,011
I don't care about their resentment,
or yours.

176
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:58,347
I wanted a boat. The Board gave it to me.

177
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,473
That's all there is.

178
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,183
The Board didn't give you a thing.

179
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,936
You went to them. The poor desk
commander with a tear in his eye.

180
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,372
You told them if you could have me,
a qualified commander,

181
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:08,357
for a backstop, you could do the job.

182
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,960
That was your selling point, wasn't it?

183
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,026
Mr. Bledsoe,

184
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,779
your request for release is denied.

185
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:24,456
Well, Commander, I'm glad I came over,

186
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,999
so to get things straightened out.

187
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,709
We're going to get along just fine.

188
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,796
Don't worry, Jim,
I'll take good care of the bride.

189
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,464
Anyone for a slug of gin?

190
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:33,674
We're out of vermouth.

191
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,759
Lieutenant Bledsoe, Laura, my exec.

192
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,344
- Hello.
- Thanks, Mrs. Richardson.

193
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:39,429
- I'll take a rain check on the drink.
- You sure?

194
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:40,597
Some other time.

195
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,015
Lieutenant?

196
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,269
If there isn't another time, good luck.

197
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:48,272
Take good care of my husband.

198
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,775
I'll take care, ma'am.

199
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,029
Take over, Mr. Conwell.

200
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:38,196
Aye, aye, sir.

201
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:47,337
Captain's off the bridge.
It won't be long now.

202
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,709
Captain's off the bridge.

203
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,836
Cap's off the bridge, Chief.
Orders coming up soon.

204
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,171
Okay.

205
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:55,464
Is he downstairs yet?

206
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,424
"Below," Jessie. The captain's below.

207
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:58,948
Hey, Chief, how much is in the pool?

208
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,844
Two hundred bucks.
Are all the areas covered?

209
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,721
I've got a five-spot on Area 22.

210
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:05,432
16 for me. I hear it's a pleasure cruise.

211
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:07,017
- I took 7.
- 7?

212
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,644
- 7?
- What?

213
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:09,728
I took 7.

214
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:10,938
That's a one-way ticket, idiot!

215
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,648
You trying to jinx us all?

216
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,191
What do you mean, "one way"?

217
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,818
No return, Jessie. No return!

218
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:18,987
But I was born on the seventh!

219
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:21,823
What with all that money in the pool...

220
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:23,992
Well, seven's lucky for me.

221
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,035
Ain't it?

222
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,748
Here you go.
The money's all locked up inside.

223
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:32,852
Bosun, tell the engine room we're
standing by, and relay to maneuvering.

224
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:35,212
- Right!
- Hey, Chief! Could I change areas?

225
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:36,713
Too late.

226
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:38,256
Gentlemen, I ask for silence.

227
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:40,717
The next voice you hear

228
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:43,053
will be the dealer.

229
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:47,349
This is the captain.

230
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:51,770
I know all of you are vitally
interested in our area assignment.

231
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,690
Here is a brief rundown of the orders

232
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:57,859
under which we will operate
during this patrol.

233
00:14:58,903 --> 00:14:59,945
Number one,

234
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,031
and I'm sure you've heard this many times,

235
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:04,616
sink enemy shipping.

236
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,618
Number two.

237
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,330
Proceed on a specified course to Area 7,

238
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:13,184
- and radio exact position
- I knew it! I just knew it!

239
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,835
- of all ships in the area.
- For Pete's sake, turn it off!

240
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,503
Number three.

241
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:21,091
Avoid the section in Area 7
known as the Bungo Straits.

242
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:26,680
Number four. Take coast intelligence
photos wherever possible.

243
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:29,224
A third of you are new men,

244
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,768
and I know there are bound
to be some questions.

245
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:34,563
Feel free to ask
your division officer anytime.

246
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,774
That's all. Thanks for your attention.

247
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:39,901
Hey, where are the Bungo Straits anyway?

248
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,695
- Why?
- He said we'll avoid it.

249
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,698
What's the difference?
He didn't say anything about avoiding 7!

250
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:47,325
Okay.
Give everyone back his money, Kohler.

251
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,911
No dice. Somebody took Area 7.

252
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:51,496
Who?

253
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,290
He did.

254
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,920
Well, jeez, fellas, I didn't know!

255
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:02,966
Well, it's my birthday!
Seven's my birthday!

256
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:21,764
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.

257
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:23,653
Range, 2,000.

258
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:25,238
All hands standing by for drill.

259
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:27,157
Very well.

260
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,992
Lookouts below!

261
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:40,337
Clear the bridge!

262
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,512
Dive! Dive!

263
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:56,061
What's the depth?

264
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,270
Thirty-eight feet, sir.

265
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:00,524
Ruby, where's the scope?

266
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,246
We're not at periscope depth yet, Captain.

267
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:04,444
Stand by to surface.

268
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:06,321
- Stand by to surface!
- Stand by to surface!

269
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:08,198
Now let's get this straight.

270
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:10,742
I want this scope up as we dive.

271
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,035
As we dive, sir?

272
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,560
I want to be ready to fire
as soon as we level off at 50 feet.

273
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:16,773
Now, I know this is all new to you,

274
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,208
but you'll just have to get used to it.

275
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:19,491
The whole purpose of this drill

276
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,795
is to dive and fire as soon as we level.

277
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,339
Let's try it again. Surface!

278
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:25,924
- Surface!
- Surface!

279
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:29,219
Blow main ballast. Hard rise on planes.

280
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,750
- Flow negative.
- Level off.

281
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,796
Eight-degree angle. Depth, 40 feet.

282
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,006
Steady on course, Captain.

283
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,591
Mark. Fifty, leveled off.

284
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,842
Fire one.

285
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:10,927
- Time?
- Forty-two seconds, sir.

286
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,388
That's not fast enough.
You have to get those vents open sooner.

287
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,751
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stand by to surface. We'll try it again.

288
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,526
- Stand by to surface!
- Stand by to surface!

289
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:26,902
Dive! Dive!

290
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,820
Open the vents on the diving alarm.

291
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,197
Taking a chance, isn't it?

292
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,281
The Captain wants a faster dive.

293
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,617
You can always shut it
if you don't get a green board.

294
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:34,701
Aye, aye, sir.

295
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:43,960
Dive! Dive!

296
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:45,587
Open them up! Flood those tanks!

297
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,231
Dive! Dive!

298
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,832
- Mark 50. Leveled off.
- Fire one.

299
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:26,169
Thirty-seven seconds, sir.

300
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,004
Good. Very good.

301
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,882
By the time
we reach Area 7, I want it down to 33.

302
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,727
- Thirty-three, sir?
- Thirty-three is right.

303
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,470
Yes, sir. Secure from battle stations, sir?

304
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:36,554
Yes, Jim.

305
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,449
- Take the con, Mr. Cartwright.
- Aye, aye, sir.

306
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:39,599
Secure from battle stations.

307
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:40,850
Secure! Third Section, take watch!

308
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:43,015
- Secure! Third Section, take over watch!
- Up scope.

309
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:44,646
All ahead one-third.

310
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,022
All ahead one-third, sir.

311
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,232
Light the smoking lamp.

312
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:00,120
I said secure.
Your tails can't be dragging that much.

313
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,206
What's the matter?

314
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,292
No gripes? No groans?

315
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,211
Isn't anyone gonna say
it's a four-second difference?

316
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,839
Not a boat in the fleet could make it?

317
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,091
Ruby, you worried about drills?

318
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,884
- No, sir.
- Poplin?

319
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,221
Now, look, I never keep
anything from a crew,

320
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,066
I don't expect them
to keep anything from me.

321
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,308
So come on, speak up.

322
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:25,228
Well, I...

323
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:28,273
I guess it's Area 7, Mr. Bledsoe.

324
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,983
Didn't you hear the captain
read the operation orders?

325
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,276
That's just it, sir.

326
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,403
He specifically mentioned
the Bungo Straits.

327
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:34,571
What difference does that make?

328
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:35,989
That's the section of Area 7

329
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:37,157
where all those subs were lost.

330
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:38,658
That's the graveyard.

331
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,411
And we've got orders to
avoid the Bungo Straits.

332
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,747
- For Pete's sake!
- Yeah, right.

333
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:46,958
- And all the time, we thought
that Area 7... - Don't think.

334
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,753
You better grab some coffee.
In 30 minutes, you got another drill.

335
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:52,088
- Drill! Drill! Drill! - Thirty-three
seconds. No boat in the fleet...

336
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,007
We could leave the hatch open.
The water might pour in,

337
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,425
the boat might go down faster.

338
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,595
How do we get back up?

339
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,138
There's no room to swim anyway.

340
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:02,766
I heard you, Lieutenant.

341
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,143
Now that you've explained the orders,

342
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:09,022
how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?

343
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,040
Captain to the bridge.
Captain to the bridge.

344
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:36,383
Easy, fellas! Take it easy!

345
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,834
She's got to last the patrol!

346
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:38,927
One pat to a customer, now!

347
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:43,512
- All ahead standard on the board.
- Okay, I got it.

348
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:46,101
Radar contact dead astern, sir.

349
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:47,727
We think it's a Jap sub.

350
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:51,022
- Has he seen us?
- Hard to tell.

351
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,691
Shall we open the outer doors
on the stern tubes, sir?

352
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,216
No, just keep her on present course.

353
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:07,664
Conning tower, manned and ready.

354
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:14,513
Comm, forward torpedo room,
manned and ready.

355
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,146
How long should we hold this course, sir?

356
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,176
- What?
- Before we double back to get him.

357
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:23,513
We're not going to double back.

358
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,473
Sir?

359
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:27,244
He might get lucky. I'm not risking it.

360
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:28,988
But we're faster, sir.
We could outmaneuver.

361
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,312
- Just hold her steady on present course.
- Aye, aye, sir.

362
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,280
- Keep a sharp lookout astern!
- Aye, aye, sir.

363
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,359
Lost radar contact at 6,500 yards, sir.

364
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,444
Very well.

365
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,195
Secure from battle stations.

366
00:22:39,864 --> 00:22:40,985
Secure from battle stations.

367
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:43,199
Second Section, take the watch.

368
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,164
I'll take the con. Lay below.

369
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,207
Aye, aye, sir.

370
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:01,885
Well, you've had the boat
for a week now, Captain.

371
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,387
I guess you noticed
how quickly she responds.

372
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:06,264
Always a little shudder, though,
when you push her too hard.

373
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:07,599
Best to ease her into it.

374
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,101
Thanks.

375
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:11,227
Anything else?

376
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:12,520
Just one thing, sir.

377
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,149
She hates showing her backsides
to Japanese submarines.

378
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:19,903
Permission to go below, sir?

379
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,362
Granted.

380
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,744
Now hear this. Now hear this.

381
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,913
Orders of the day. To your sacks, men.

382
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,916
You've got 25 seconds
to lay flat on your backs.

383
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,252
Any of you gripers want a sleeping pill?

384
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:37,504
He's a caution.

385
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,255
Isn't he a caution?

386
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,090
Give the skipper a couple, will you?

387
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:43,426
A Jap sub and all these drills,

388
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,803
Captain must be running scared.
Is that what it is?

389
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:48,723
It's the craziest war patrol
I ever started on.

390
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:51,309
Who said anything about a war patrol?

391
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,061
You're all confused, my friend.

392
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,104
We're on a drill patrol here.

393
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:58,274
The first time
in the annals of the Navy Department.

394
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,776
What's it all mean?

395
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,736
What's he got in mind?

396
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,112
Haven't you heard?

397
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:05,448
He's gonna challenge the Japs to a drill.

398
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:08,618
The winner's going to get
an all-expense-paid honeymoon trip

399
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:11,287
with Tokyo Rose in the Bungo Straits.

400
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,331
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate.

401
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:16,125
Let us pay tribute to that great motto.

402
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:18,461
"Caution with safety,
and safety with caution."

403
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:21,839
No, let's do better than that.

404
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:25,593
Let's drink a toast
to our beloved captain, the drill master.

405
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:28,846
For it was he that knew our fleet
boat was faster than a Jap sub.

406
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:30,306
I think I've had enough kidding, Jerry.

407
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:32,725
Why? A cautious captain
with orders that say, "Avoid"?

408
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,145
Now, if we stay out of Area 7
as well as the Bungo Straits, we're in!

409
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,040
I'll bet he's thinking
of a way right now...

410
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:39,941
Excuse me, sir. Your watch list.

411
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,401
What about that, Mueller?

412
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:42,819
You're pretty chummy with the captain.

413
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:45,196
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr. Cartwright.

414
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:46,322
Do you, sir?

415
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:48,408
Come back here, Kraut!

416
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:51,452
Get out, Mueller. Go on.

417
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,333
You have any questions, Cartwright,
you come to me,

418
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,253
not members of the crew. You understand?

419
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,338
And that goes for your opinions, too.

420
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,509
Maybe we better break this up.
It's getting late.

421
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:22,775
Shut up.

422
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:51,054
Battle stations manned, Captain.

423
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:52,513
Standing by for drill.

424
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,940
Lookouts below!

425
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:08,112
Clear the bridge!

426
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:15,870
Dive! Dive!

427
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:41,312
Surface! Surface!

428
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:49,404
Someone left topside, sir.

429
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:51,155
- All stop.
- All stop, sir.

430
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,323
Emergency surface!

431
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:22,979
Open up!

432
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:45,042
You all right?

433
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:46,794
I'm all right, sir. I'm okay.

434
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:49,141
Who gave you permission
to dump the garbage?

435
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:51,215
Mr. Cartwright, sir.

436
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,842
I thought he'd already asked the O.
D., sir.

437
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,552
I was on the bridge
with Mr. Beckman, and I didn't hear...

438
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:55,720
Get below.

439
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,013
Yes, sir.

440
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:01,476
The captain gives permission to dump
the trash, and only the captain.

441
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:04,312
Instead of losing time on this drill,
we almost lose a man!

442
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:07,982
Stand by to dive!

443
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:10,026
Check the watch, Mr. Kohler.

444
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:11,277
Aye, aye, sir.

445
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:14,280
Mr. Bledsoe.

446
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:17,867
Yes, sir?

447
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,869
Have you been with this boat long?

448
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,370
Over a year, sir.

449
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:25,708
And is this
the kind of cooperation you usually get?

450
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:29,921
No, sir.

451
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:32,924
A man could have been killed today.

452
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,884
The responsibility is yours, Mr. Bledsoe,

453
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:36,844
you're in charge of the drills.

454
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:38,095
I have no excuses, Captain.

455
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:40,908
But under the circumstances,
the crew did their best.

456
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:41,974
What circumstances?

457
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,059
Don't press it, sir.

458
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:44,685
I intend to. I want an answer.

459
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:47,063
It's one thing to drill
a crew for fighting.

460
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:48,606
But when you duck a Jap sub,

461
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,483
they wonder why they should
break their backs on drills

462
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,368
when the captain
has no stomach for attacking.

463
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:55,112
"What does he want?
Obedience? Efficiency?"

464
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:57,573
Or the best-drilled cowards in the Navy?

465
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:03,830
Mr. Bledsoe, tell them I am doubling
the drills, starting tomorrow.

466
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,916
Yes, sir.

467
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,963
You might as well know, sir,
I don't believe it.

468
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:13,089
Believe what?

469
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,508
That you ran away from that sub
from cowardice.

470
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,316
Yeah, sure, I know what you mean,

471
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:34,861
but what's the cook supposed to do,
eat the garbage?

472
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:37,321
- We haven't had a minute to...
- Hey! Hey, Vince!

473
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,079
SJ contact! SJ contact!

474
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:48,416
Bearing 330, range, 15 miles.

475
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:50,835
Looks like a big one, huh?

476
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,199
It's not a fishing boat, friend.

477
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,800
Picking up two of them now, sir.

478
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,912
Range closing. The first check
puts enemy on southerly course.

479
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,017
Very well.

480
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:10,563
Right full rudder!
Come right to course 330!

481
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,316
Right full rudder, sir.
Coming right to 330.

482
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,483
Very well.

483
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:15,902
Looks like he's going to go in.

484
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:17,528
Sightseeing, Pat.

485
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:18,613
Just sightseeing.

486
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,045
I can see them now.

487
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:38,341
Lead ship, possible Momo destroyer.

488
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:40,092
Trailing ship, a large tanker.

489
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,971
We'll wait until the
destroyer passes clear,

490
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:45,214
then we'll take on the tanker.

491
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:48,351
Shifting to TBT. Bearing coming down.

492
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,282
Bearing 020.

493
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:06,327
Set, sir.

494
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,664
Right full rudder. Come
right to course 030.

495
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:12,208
Open outer doors on tubes one and two.

496
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,812
Open outer doors on tubes one and two.

497
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,397
Open outer doors on tubes one and two!

498
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:29,141
Angle on the bow now, starboard 70.

499
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:31,102
Torpedo spread, one right, one left.

500
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:32,561
Solution checking.

501
00:31:33,397 --> 00:31:35,189
Everything's set, sir.

502
00:31:35,732 --> 00:31:37,274
Destroyer's well clear now, Captain.

503
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,859
Tanker range, 3,200.

504
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:40,569
- All ready to fire, sir.
- Very well.

505
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:42,405
Stand by, tube one.

506
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:44,782
- Stand by, tube one.
- Stand by, tube one!

507
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:55,918
What's the torpedo run?

508
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:57,253
2,500 yards, sir.

509
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:58,421
Commence firing.

510
00:31:58,463 --> 00:31:59,588
Fire one!

511
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,507
- Fire one!
- Fire one.

512
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,343
One fired, sir.

513
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:05,928
- Stand by, two.
- Stand by, two!

514
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:07,430
- Spread set.
- Fire two!

515
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:09,473
- Fire two!
- Fire two.

516
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:12,393
Two fired, sir.

517
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:15,104
Torpedo number one running hot,
straight and normal, sir.

518
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:58,147
Destroyer's angle on the bow now zero.

519
00:32:58,231 --> 00:32:59,231
Bearing?

520
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:06,113
Bearing 045.

521
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,907
He's heading right at us.

522
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:10,493
Keep the sound on him, Cullen.
We'll have orders to go deep in a second.

523
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:11,535
Aye, aye, sir.

524
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:15,831
If you had any questions about the drills,

525
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,394
I think you'll have them answered now.

526
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,960
We're taking on the Momo.

527
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:23,964
Right standard rudder.
Come right to course 045.

528
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,634
Right standard rudder, sir.
Coming right to 045.

529
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:28,010
Very well.

530
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:31,347
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

531
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,408
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

532
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:35,073
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

533
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:37,686
Range to destroyer, 2,000. Bearing steady.

534
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:39,751
Closing in fast, sir. Coming head on.

535
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:54,411
At range 1,500, we'll crash-dive.

536
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,144
At 50 feet, we'll give her two fish.

537
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:58,916
Down their throats? That's a bow shot.

538
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:01,418
Range, 1,800.

539
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:19,478
Lookouts below!

540
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,357
Stand by to dive.

541
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,401
- Stand by to dive!
- Stand by to dive.

542
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:26,735
Clear the bridge!

543
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:35,286
Dive! Dive!

544
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:55,014
Bearing,

545
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:56,265
- mark.
- 044.

546
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:58,267
- Set?
- Depth, 34 feet.

547
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,560
Ten-degree angle.

548
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:00,686
Thirty-nine feet.

549
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:02,479
Level off.

550
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:04,064
Forty-four feet.

551
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:05,608
Steady on course, Captain.

552
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,151
Stand by on tube three.

553
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:09,403
Stand by, three.

554
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:13,657
Leveled off at 50, Captain!

555
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:15,534
- Fire three!
- Fire three!

556
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,287
Three fired, sir.

557
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,415
Fire four.

558
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,958
Fire four!

559
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:25,416
- Four fired, sir.
- Stand by to take her down fast.

560
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:29,089
- Stand by to take her down fast!
- Aye, aye, sir. Standing by.

561
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:48,150
Got 'em! We got 'em!

562
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:50,903
Thirty-two seconds. Thirty-two seconds!

563
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:01,121
Left full rudder. All ahead one-third.

564
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:03,475
- Left full rudder, all ahead
one-third, sir. - Very well.

565
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,875
Now hear this. Captain speaking.

566
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:08,254
You've just given
a Jap tin can the deep-six with a bow shot

567
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,505
in 32 seconds.

568
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,608
Gentlemen,
I think this boat is ready for anything.

569
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,092
Let's keep it that way.

570
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,927
Drills, no more than usual tomorrow.

571
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:16,095
- Bledsoe.
- Yes, sir.

572
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,680
Take the con.
Get us back on our base course.

573
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,014
Aye, aye, sir.

574
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:20,975
Boy, that skipper!

575
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,810
Let me tell you, he knows his stuff.

576
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:24,019
That was amazing!

577
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:37,157
Come here, you guys. Listen to this.

578
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:40,911
"Dear Commander,
Japanese Imperial Fleet."

579
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:45,165
"Be it hereby known that on July 31, 1943,"

580
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:49,169
"the USS Nerka, under the
command of Captain P.J. Richardson,"

581
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:51,046
"sunk a Japanese destroyer."

582
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:54,508
- Be quiet!
- "One down, 20 fish to go!"

583
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,343
Signed, Kraut Mueller.

584
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:57,553
How do you like that, Chief?

585
00:36:57,637 --> 00:36:59,346
We've been drilling
for a bow shot all the time.

586
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:00,889
Hey, Ruby, you were up there, huh?

587
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,891
Right on the pickle, dear friend.

588
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:05,352
That tin can zigs right into us.

589
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:06,687
I tell you, I was shaking.

590
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,980
What about the old man? What did he do?

591
00:37:08,064 --> 00:37:10,399
Calm, you know what I mean?
No excitement.

592
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,360
He just orders two fish
right down her throat.

593
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,029
Just like you'd order ham and eggs.

594
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,989
If we'd missed, though,
we wouldn't have lived long enough

595
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:18,157
to get into Area 7,

596
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,492
which I still think
we won't live long enough to get out of!

597
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:23,037
"If, if, if." Go back to Sears, Roebuck,
will you?

598
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,164
Forgive me if I interrupt the music.

599
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:28,667
You are listening once again
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose,

600
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:32,129
speaking to you from the heart of
the mighty Japanese Empire,

601
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:36,050
telling you in your own
language of a war you cannot win.

602
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:38,677
It has been substantiated
that we have destroyed

603
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,763
16 enemy ships this month alone.

604
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,098
Come on, Rosie,
why don't you get up to date, huh?

605
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:44,975
You're missing one Jap tin can!

606
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:49,772
Jessie! Jessie, dear friend.

607
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:51,982
We've decided to be big about it.

608
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:55,444
We're not going to
hold you responsible for Area 7 any longer.

609
00:37:55,612 --> 00:37:56,820
We'll take back the money.

610
00:37:57,072 --> 00:38:00,199
Gosh. Well, that's nice of you fellas,

611
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:03,786
but my conscience hurt me so much
I threw it overboard.

612
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,086
Not now, Kohler.

613
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:13,695
Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.

614
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:18,217
I've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen them together.

615
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:21,011
But I never saw one run away
from a Jap sub before,

616
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:24,139
then take on a destroyer with a shot
I didn't even know was in the book.

617
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,058
There has to be a reason.

618
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:32,314
That bow shot didn't just happen.

619
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,690
The drills were planned for it.

620
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:34,817
The whole thing was...

621
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,279
I never heard of a bow shot being set up

622
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:41,073
where it wasn't used in desperation.

623
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,325
It's all like some experiment!

624
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:46,995
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he thought he could get an Akikaze.

625
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:50,249
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a hell of a difference.

626
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,418
This Akikaze's in the Bungo Straits.

627
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,003
But that's impossible.
The orders say to avoid it.

628
00:38:57,757 --> 00:38:58,841
I know.

629
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:10,185
Look, I know how you feel
about him taking the boat and all,

630
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:13,272
but don't you think
you're working at it overtime, sir?

631
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:16,692
We'll be hitting Area 7 tomorrow morning.

632
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:10,621
Four.

633
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:13,499
Five.

634
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:15,834
Six.

635
00:40:17,212 --> 00:40:18,412
It's a convoy, all right, sir.

636
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:20,547
Bearing 320, relative.

637
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:28,743
Sounds like a whole lot of them, sir.

638
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:31,767
Cullen.

639
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:32,976
Right, sir.

640
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:35,312
I have the dive, Captain. Depth, 60 feet.

641
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,076
Forward torpedo room
manned and ready, sir.

642
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,649
We're undetected, sir.

643
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,776
After torpedo room manned and ready, sir.

644
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,545
We're dead ahead of the convoy, Captain.

645
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,655
What firing position shall we take?

646
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,368
Captain?

647
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:53,038
Take her down, sir?

648
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,543
Take her down to 100 feet.

649
00:40:57,877 --> 00:40:59,336
A hundred feet. Aye, aye, sir.

650
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,798
Five-degree down bubble!
Take her to 100 feet.

651
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:05,193
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.

652
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:06,260
Aye, sir.

653
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:08,387
Come right to course 280.

654
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:10,639
- Coming right to course 280, sir.
- Very well.

655
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:12,432
Mr. Cartwright, take over the con.

656
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:13,475
Yes, sir.

657
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:16,520
What's he doing? What's going on?

658
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:23,151
Give me a line on course 280.

659
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,862
- Sir?
- A line on course 280. Now!

660
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:26,989
Aye, sir.

661
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:29,157
- What's the skipper up to?
- Later, Beckman.

662
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,328
- Start leveling off.
- Aye, sir.

663
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:52,848
There it is. You might as well post it.

664
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:55,076
A whole area to patrol,
and you pick the graveyard!

665
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:56,935
The Bungo Straits!

666
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:01,356
It's the only place we can get the Akikaze.

667
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:03,400
The one spot
the orders direct you to avoid!

668
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:05,652
You make it sound like a snap decision.

669
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,862
It wasn't, Jim.

670
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:08,238
That's quite obvious now, sir.

671
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:10,657
Passing a Jap submarine
to save your torpedoes,

672
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,367
jeopardizing the whole boat
with a bow shot,

673
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,953
ducking a convoy
so they can't radio our position.

674
00:42:15,204 --> 00:42:16,538
You planned it, all right.

675
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:18,206
And you knew it the day
I came to your house.

676
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:19,875
I knew it before that, Jim.

677
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,169
I knew it a year ago,
when my boat went down.

678
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:24,755
We have operational orders.
They're explicit.

679
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,319
We have a crew that expects
the captain to follow those orders.

680
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:30,260
You know as well as I do
that a captain can redefine orders

681
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:31,625
if he feels he has an advantage.

682
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,721
What advantage?

683
00:42:32,805 --> 00:42:34,348
You just named it! A bow shot!

684
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:36,933
We proved we could do it with a Momo.
We can do it again.

685
00:42:37,143 --> 00:42:39,728
You call that an advantage when there are
four subs out there before us

686
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:41,355
that never even had a chance to shoot?

687
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:42,689
They were detected.

688
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:44,232
Not even Pearl knows where we are.

689
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,859
And what about the Japanese Navy?

690
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:48,403
No, sir.
That's no advantage, not in my book.

691
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:51,073
But you're not the captain.

692
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,160
If you should fail
and somehow come out of this alive,

693
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:57,871
there won't be a desk
small enough for you this time.

694
00:42:58,665 --> 00:43:00,540
That's strange, Jim.

695
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,417
I never even thought of failing.

696
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:06,171
You've got a lot of guts, sir,

697
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,131
with other people's lives.

698
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:10,258
That's my decision and my responsibility.

699
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,427
To whom, sir?
To a crew that died a year ago?

700
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:14,846
Yes! To a dead crew, a dead sub!

701
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,520
Now, believe what you want.

702
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:29,569
Well, this crew's still alive. They at least
have a right to know where they're going.

703
00:43:29,612 --> 00:43:30,862
Do I have to tell them?

704
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:33,907
What's the matter, Captain?

705
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,710
Surely you've got guts
enough for this, too.

706
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,206
This is the Captain.

707
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,291
Due to conditions of special advantage,

708
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:46,294
I have decided
to take this boat to the Bungo Straits.

709
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:21,163
Bungo Straits, broad on the port beam.

710
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:33,884
We're there.

711
00:44:36,763 --> 00:44:38,263
Bungo Straits.

712
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:41,475
We're at the Straits.

713
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:44,686
Bungo Straits.

714
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:48,482
Bungo Straits.

715
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:50,942
Bungo Straits.

716
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,533
We're there. We're in the Straits.

717
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:05,373
If I'd only been born on the eighth.

718
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:09,127
See you a moment, sir?

719
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:19,387
- What is this?
- Well, we...

720
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:21,348
We want to talk to you, Jim.

721
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,141
I've been looking
through the Navy rules and regulations.

722
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:24,518
We want you to take over.

723
00:45:27,814 --> 00:45:30,065
Well, that's very flattering, gentlemen.

724
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:32,400
Let's go. Everyone outside.

725
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:33,735
We're talking about Navy orders!

726
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,237
- What right does he got to...
- A captain's right.

727
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:36,905
That's all he needs.

728
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:39,115
We might as well
make up our minds right now.

729
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,826
We're going to follow his orders.

730
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,244
Where? To the bottom?

731
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,447
If that's what he's got in
mind, that's where we'll go.

732
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:46,748
This boat, any boat, has one captain.

733
00:45:49,669 --> 00:45:51,211
Is that right, Kohler?

734
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,380
Yes, sir.

735
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:56,299
Is that right, Mr. Cartwright?

736
00:45:56,926 --> 00:45:58,134
Yes, sir.

737
00:45:58,219 --> 00:45:59,469
Let's break this up.

738
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,148
Mr. Cartwright?

739
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:14,568
With all due respect to your rank,

740
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:16,528
may I say that I think you're an ass?

741
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:21,992
I see by this report
that you called Mr. Cartwright an ass.

742
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:24,119
- Yes, sir.
- An officer?

743
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,288
That's right, sir.

744
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:28,415
Mueller, you're a damn fool.

745
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,625
Yes, sir. I know it.

746
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:34,129
But as long as I overheard,
you might as well know, too, Captain.

747
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:35,964
They wanted Mr. Bledsoe to take over.

748
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:38,091
Well, he put an end to that fast.

749
00:46:38,134 --> 00:46:39,134
He would.

750
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:42,116
Would you tell me something, Mueller?

751
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:43,513
If I can, sir.

752
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:44,890
Am I a damn fool, too?

753
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:46,850
Sir?

754
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:48,727
Well, Mr. Bledsoe seems to think I am,

755
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:50,854
and I have a great respect for his opinion.

756
00:46:51,314 --> 00:46:54,274
Well, maybe you have to be,
Captain, to do something like this.

757
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:57,193
Look, sir,
you nailed that Momo with a bow shot.

758
00:46:57,278 --> 00:46:59,070
Why not the Akikaze?

759
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:01,698
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller. Never.

760
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:04,159
Well, he will this time, sir.

761
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:08,997
Is that a classified opinion,
or am I at liberty to repeat it?

762
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,123
It's a fact, sir.

763
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:13,293
A fact they'll all realize
at Bungo Pete's funeral.

764
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:10,475
Convoy now bearing 313.
Range, 7,000 yards.

765
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:14,479
Are we going to set up
on the leading ship, sir?

766
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:16,982
No, that's a decoy. Shallow draft.

767
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:19,109
Used to draw fire away from the convoy.

768
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:22,696
You could shoot 10 fish.
They'd only run under.

769
00:48:32,873 --> 00:48:35,458
There!
There she is, pulling up with the convoy.

770
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:37,168
- The Akikaze?
- Yes.

771
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:40,171
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.

772
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:42,841
Look at her cut through there.
Must be making 30 knots.

773
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,344
Doesn't stay in one position long enough
to give you a target.

774
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:47,929
Not unless she's coming toward you.

775
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:50,390
Take over in the conning tower.

776
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,851
Start tracking
the next-to-last ship in the port column.

777
00:48:52,935 --> 00:48:54,394
- We'll give you a bearing on her.
- Aye, aye, sir.

778
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:56,187
- Right standard rudder!
- Right standard rudder, sir!

779
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:57,272
Very well.

780
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:05,071
This is the Captain.

781
00:49:05,114 --> 00:49:07,907
The convoy we've been waiting
for is on our starboard bow.

782
00:49:08,451 --> 00:49:10,785
The plan of attack is as follows. First,

783
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:13,329
we'll strike a freighter going in.

784
00:49:13,414 --> 00:49:15,540
If that doesn't bring
the Akikaze toward us,

785
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,126
we'll attack the freighter nearest him.

786
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,754
When the Akikaze does head toward us,
bow on,

787
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:23,798
we'll dive and
give him two fish at 1,500 yards,

788
00:49:23,883 --> 00:49:25,300
just like the Momo.

789
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:27,677
Let's go. All ahead standard.

790
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:29,471
- All ahead standard, sir.
- Very well.

791
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,139
All ahead standard on board.

792
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:41,399
How's the target course
and speed check with the TDC?

793
00:49:41,484 --> 00:49:43,818
Course checks. Speed, one knot slower.

794
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:50,241
Plane contact, sir.

795
00:49:53,996 --> 00:49:56,039
Captain, radar's picked up an enemy plane.

796
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:00,085
Lookouts, planes coming in.
Watch for them.

797
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:02,170
Aye, aye, sir.

798
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,255
15 miles. Range closing.

799
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:06,132
Plane's 15 miles. Range closing.

800
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,769
They're closing fast, sir.

801
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:21,314
Plane's closing fast, sir!

802
00:50:21,357 --> 00:50:22,357
They must've known.

803
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:24,150
The Japs must've known we were here.

804
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:26,807
We're going in according to plan.

805
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:29,030
Give me the setup.

806
00:50:29,365 --> 00:50:31,606
- Stay right on that freighter, Beckman.
- Aye, aye, sir.

807
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:33,660
Range on freighter, 2,000, sir.

808
00:50:33,702 --> 00:50:35,829
Track 70, gyro 20 right.

809
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:38,164
Recommend firing course 297.

810
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:40,166
Come right to 297.

811
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:43,002
- Coming right to course 297, sir!
- Very well.

812
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:44,462
Plane, six miles.

813
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:47,193
They'll be on us in a minute, Captain.

814
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:49,217
Stand by.

815
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:51,136
Ready on tubes one and two.

816
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,804
Outer doors open. Standing by.

817
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:55,348

818
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:57,767
Commence firing.

819
00:50:58,227 --> 00:50:59,227
Fire one!

820
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:00,937
- Fire one!
- Fire one!

821
00:51:03,566 --> 00:51:05,191
- One has been fired.
- One fired, sir.

822
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,985
One's away. Fire two.

823
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,404
- Fire two!
- Fire two.

824
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:11,990
Two has been fired.

825
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:13,533
- Two fired, sir.
- Two's away!

826
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:15,577
Make ready stern tubes.

827
00:51:16,162 --> 00:51:17,162
Make ready stern tubes!

828
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:18,580
Make ready stern tubes!

829
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:19,831
Aircraft now one mile.

830
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:22,625
Come to course 089.

831
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:24,711
Coming to course 089, sir.

832
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:26,254
Very well.

833
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:27,630
Time check on first torpedo.

834
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:30,133
Five seconds. Four...

835
00:51:39,935 --> 00:51:41,436
Both fish hit. She's headed down.

836
00:51:41,937 --> 00:51:43,605
- Stern tubes ready, sir.
- Very well.

837
00:51:44,106 --> 00:51:46,441
Aircraft range steady.
Appear to be circling overhead.

838
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:54,115
Right full rudder. All ahead flank.

839
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:55,967
Right full rudder, all ahead flank, sir!

840
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:59,871
Shift target to Akikaze. He's coming on.

841
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:01,789
Bearing, coming down.

842
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:08,880
- Bearing 250!
- 250, sir.

843
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:32,612
Radar to bridge. Aircraft returning!

844
00:52:39,578 --> 00:52:40,787
Range, 4,000.

845
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,830
Tubes three and four ready.
Outer doors open.

846
00:53:00,683 --> 00:53:01,804
Shall we take her down, sir?

847
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:03,726
Not yet, not yet. Lookouts below!

848
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:05,603
Stand by.

849
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:07,355
Range, 3,000.

850
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,524
We'll have to fire from surface. Stand by.

851
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,491
Commence firing!

852
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:20,952
- Fire three.
- Fire three!

853
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:25,100
- Three fired, sir.
- Three's away, sir.

854
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:36,050
Clear the bridge!

855
00:53:40,222 --> 00:53:41,556
Dive! Dive!

856
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:55,236
- Take her down to 300, fast!
- Aye, aye, sir!

857
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:56,682
Give me a time check on that fish.

858
00:53:57,323 --> 00:53:58,906
Twenty-four, twenty-three...

859
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:01,409
Torpedo screws, sir.
Heading in toward our port side.

860
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:10,710
Must be that last torpedo, sir.

861
00:54:10,753 --> 00:54:11,753
It's a runaway!

862
00:54:11,837 --> 00:54:12,920
It's coming back at us.

863
00:54:13,547 --> 00:54:15,423
Crash dive! Sound collision alarm.

864
00:54:43,202 --> 00:54:44,869
Passing 75 feet, sir.

865
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:49,165
Passing 90 feet, sir.

866
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,126
Destroyer coming in, sir.

867
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:40,216
He's shifting to attack frequency, sir.

868
00:55:53,647 --> 00:55:54,981
Picking up splashes, sir.

869
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:56,983
Depth charges on their way down.

870
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:00,611
Passing 150 feet.

871
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:54,999
Ignited torpedo!

872
00:56:55,984 --> 00:56:58,145
- Pass along that T wrench!
- It's all right, leave it.

873
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,296
The governor'll stop her at 2,100 rpm.

874
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:11,682
Forward torpedo room reporting.

875
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:13,142
Hatch was blown on the main...

876
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:16,312
We cannot make...

877
00:57:17,105 --> 00:57:18,481
Forward torpedo room.

878
00:57:20,234 --> 00:57:21,442
Forward torpedo room!

879
00:57:24,738 --> 00:57:26,197
Forward torpedo room!

880
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:28,908
Forward torpedo room!

881
00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:31,369
Phone circuit's out, sir.

882
00:57:31,453 --> 00:57:33,162
- Check on the damage.
- Yes, sir.

883
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:06,529
Coming through. Watch it.

884
00:58:07,656 --> 00:58:09,407
Captain wants a report on the damage.

885
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:11,242
Couple of dogs sheared off the hatch.

886
00:58:11,326 --> 00:58:12,326
Can you fix it?

887
00:58:12,411 --> 00:58:13,452
We'll know in a minute.

888
00:58:17,457 --> 00:58:19,375
Turn on emergency lights.

889
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:23,504
Torpedo room.
Forward torpedo room, report.

890
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:27,174
Forward torpedo room!

891
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:29,748
Take the con. I'm going to check.

892
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:31,846
Leveling off!

893
00:58:32,014 --> 00:58:34,307
- All ahead one-third!
- All ahead one-third, sir.

894
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,569
The hatch sprung?

895
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:48,154
Couple of dogs sheared off, Captain!

896
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:17,975
Close the hatch!

897
00:59:23,023 --> 00:59:24,940
Come on, close the hatch!

898
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:46,170
Go!

899
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:52,718
Losing depth control. Heavy forward.

900
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:54,345
Request more speed, sir.

901
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:55,638
Forward room must be flooding.

902
00:59:55,764 --> 00:59:58,099
- All ahead standard!
- All ahead standard, sir!

903
01:00:07,734 --> 01:00:08,943
You okay, sir?

904
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:10,277
Yeah.

905
01:00:11,279 --> 01:00:12,446
Compartment flooded?

906
01:00:12,948 --> 01:00:14,073
Partially.

907
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:15,950
Three dead.

908
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:26,168
They're coming in for the kill, sir.

909
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:32,007
Only way to get out of this alive

910
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:33,572
is to make them think we're all dead.

911
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:34,969
Send up an oil slick?

912
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:37,263
We'll send up everything.
Blankets, gear, everything.

913
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:39,140
Jim.

914
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:42,685
The men that were killed.

915
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,146
Send them up through the tubes.

916
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:48,691
Yes, sir.

917
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:01,115
Screws diminishing, sir.

918
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:20,426
Captain?

919
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:22,887
Captain, there's something else here.
Listen.

920
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:28,893
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

921
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,094
What's the situation on the hatch?

922
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:05,220
It's okay, Captain.

923
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:08,474
The engineer should have the new parts
ready in a couple of hours.

924
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:12,686
It's well secured with
block and tackle, sir.

925
01:04:15,273 --> 01:04:16,649
Clear the compartment.

926
01:04:17,192 --> 01:04:19,026
Okay, everybody out. Come on.

927
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,195
On the double. Let's go, fellas.

928
01:04:35,543 --> 01:04:38,671
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

929
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:40,798
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

930
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,051
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

931
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:51,850
Here. Better take a swallow, sir.

932
01:04:53,645 --> 01:04:54,812
What is it?

933
01:04:54,938 --> 01:04:56,730
A stimulant, Captain,
from the medical safe.

934
01:04:57,524 --> 01:04:59,316
It's 100 proof, sir.

935
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:02,861
How long have I been out?

936
01:05:03,697 --> 01:05:05,457
- Just a few minutes, Captain.
- Here you go.

937
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:08,325
No.

938
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:11,972
You'd better worry about yourself, sir.

939
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:13,831
You're gonna be in for a pretty rough time.

940
01:05:14,315 --> 01:05:16,476
Please, Captain.
Hendrix knows what he's talking about.

941
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:18,043
You've had a pretty bad concussion.

942
01:05:18,086 --> 01:05:19,545
It's worse than that.

943
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:21,171
There's a long medical term for it,

944
01:05:21,256 --> 01:05:22,840
but it all adds up
to blacking out every now and then

945
01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:24,216
for quite a while.

946
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:27,070
If you don't keep off your feet, sir,

947
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:29,346
you're gonna be blacking out permanently.

948
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:35,602
You'll keep this to yourselves.

949
01:05:36,187 --> 01:05:38,772
- But, sir, in my report...
- That's an order, Hendrix.

950
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,862
Send for Mr. Bledsoe.

951
01:05:46,906 --> 01:05:47,948
Well? Go on!

952
01:05:48,658 --> 01:05:49,783
Yes, sir.

953
01:06:17,395 --> 01:06:21,148
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.

954
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:24,568
We'll have to set up a
jury-rig for the radio,

955
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,720
and the radar needs some work, too.

956
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:28,530
That's another 24 hours.

957
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,033
That's not bad, considering.

958
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:33,827
We'll lay over for two days

959
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:34,995
and then we can get moving, huh?

960
01:06:35,038 --> 01:06:36,580
Yeah. The timing's perfect.

961
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:39,291
Those convoys come out every 48 hours.

962
01:06:42,003 --> 01:06:43,462
You really got shook up, didn't you?

963
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:44,546
No.

964
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:46,757
No, I couldn't feel better.

965
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:48,592
Then maybe I didn't hear you right.

966
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:50,803
You heard me right.

967
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:52,513
I'm talking about the Straits,

968
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:54,431
going back to the Bungo Straits.

969
01:07:00,235 --> 01:07:01,915
We're through playing with lives, Captain.

970
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,440
This boat's had it. It's
the end of the line.

971
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:06,026
Why? Because a torpedo went wild?

972
01:07:06,444 --> 01:07:09,113
You know yourself that's 100-to-1.
An accident!

973
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:10,864
The whole Japanese Air Force,

974
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:12,533
dropping everything it's got.

975
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:15,035
That's an accident, too?

976
01:07:15,203 --> 01:07:17,663
The next time around, we'll make it.

977
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,874
What are you gonna do?

978
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,679
Swim back to the Straits or use a lifeboat?

979
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:25,129
Because that's
all the help you're gonna get.

980
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:28,382
Those are tall words.

981
01:07:29,217 --> 01:07:30,926
You better stop and think a minute.

982
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,803
I have thought about it, Captain.

983
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:35,848
That wasn't
exactly a tea party the crew held before.

984
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,211
They wanted me to take over then,

985
01:07:37,225 --> 01:07:39,225
and I can assure you
they'll feel the same way now.

986
01:07:39,227 --> 01:07:41,478
You make one move to take over this boat,

987
01:07:41,563 --> 01:07:43,730
and I swear, I'll see that you're hung.

988
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:45,107
Then we'll hang together.

989
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:48,443
The orders were disobeyed.
It's a proven fact. No more technicalities.

990
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:50,154
A fleet boat of the Navy,

991
01:07:50,238 --> 01:07:52,614
a submarine
with her fighting power still intact,

992
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:54,825
and you'd take her back to Pearl?

993
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,076
I don't believe it!

994
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,709
Mr. Cartwright!

995
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:11,758
Yes, sir?

996
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,055
Mr. Cartwright, we'll lay over two days
for repairs before returning to Pearl.

997
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:18,682
I'll be in command.

998
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:20,767
Get a detail started right away.

999
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:22,186
Yes, sir.

1000
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:24,313
That's all, Cartwright.

1001
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:26,940
Yes, sir.

1002
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,990
The best exec
I could possibly get in the whole Navy,

1003
01:08:35,074 --> 01:08:36,617
"the backstop," I think you said,

1004
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:40,954
and the first command you give as
a captain is to order a retreat.

1005
01:09:04,646 --> 01:09:06,688
Goodbye, Bungo

1006
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:08,440
Hello, Pearl

1007
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,401
Funny, funny, funny!

1008
01:09:11,486 --> 01:09:12,653
What's with you?

1009
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:14,655
I'm trying to eat. Knock it off.
That's all.

1010
01:09:14,697 --> 01:09:16,365
What is this, a private dining room?

1011
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:18,116
You wanna sing? Go to the head!

1012
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:20,160
It'll take a little more than you
to put me there!

1013
01:09:20,245 --> 01:09:22,329
Break it up! Break it up!

1014
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:23,956
What's the matter with you guys?

1015
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:26,166
We're going back to Pearl, aren't we?

1016
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:31,255
How many patrols have you had,
Mr. Sears, Roebuck?

1017
01:09:32,632 --> 01:09:34,091
This is my second.

1018
01:09:34,175 --> 01:09:36,134
I've had five since '42.

1019
01:09:36,177 --> 01:09:39,179
I've taken depth charges,
shells, strafings,

1020
01:09:39,472 --> 01:09:42,015
even a bombing run off the Solomons.

1021
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,892
But it's the first time
I've ever gone back to Pearl

1022
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:45,852
with 15 torpedoes still aboard.

1023
01:09:48,106 --> 01:09:49,523
- Kohler?
- Yes, sir?

1024
01:09:49,649 --> 01:09:51,850
- Better get the torpedo check started.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1025
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:54,486
Mr. Cartwright, do you think
we could've had him, sir?

1026
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:56,822
- What?
- Well, suppose...

1027
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:58,865
Suppose that fish hadn't gone wild, sir.

1028
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:01,109
You think that aircraft
was just playing games up there?

1029
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,036
The Japs had us detected
before we moved in.

1030
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:04,579
But the Captain said when we moved out...

1031
01:10:04,664 --> 01:10:06,331
The Captain's flat on his back.

1032
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:08,542
We'd be better off
if somebody put him there sooner.

1033
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,127
Kohler,
get started on that before the watch.

1034
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:11,878
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Mr. Cartwright?

1035
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:13,922
This time words just fail me.

1036
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:22,699
- It's this way, sir. I...
- Why didn't you stop him?

1037
01:10:22,724 --> 01:10:24,725
- I didn't know it was gonna happen.
- You were here, weren't you?

1038
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:25,892
- Yes, sir, but...
- But you let it go on.

1039
01:10:25,977 --> 01:10:27,227
- Well, no, sir, I...
- Then it didn't happen?

1040
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:28,395
Well, yes, sir, it happened, but...

1041
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:31,398
If I have to put every member
of this crew on report, I will!

1042
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:33,108
It was my fault, sir.

1043
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:37,904
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the O. D. you're on report.

1044
01:10:39,532 --> 01:10:40,741
- Sir?
- What'd you say?

1045
01:10:40,825 --> 01:10:42,534
- I only said...
- I told you once, Mr. Cartwright,

1046
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,328
to keep your opinions to yourself!

1047
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,121
Now get out of here.

1048
01:10:46,831 --> 01:10:48,081
Yes, sir.

1049
01:10:53,338 --> 01:10:56,256
I'm not gonna stand
for any fighting or insubordination.

1050
01:10:56,341 --> 01:10:59,926
If you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken! You hear?

1051
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:08,101
How about that?
Chewing out an officer in front of us.

1052
01:11:08,186 --> 01:11:09,603
He was chewing us all out.

1053
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:11,313
What's he so sore at us for?

1054
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,445
Turn it up a bit, huh?

1055
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:19,988
It's okay. Let's leave it.

1056
01:11:24,369 --> 01:11:27,079
What are you trying to do, break the plate?

1057
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:31,416
You are listening once again

1058
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:33,335
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose.

1059
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:34,836
- Ed, turn it off.
- Did you like the music?

1060
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:35,962
Yes, sir.

1061
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:38,131
I play it tonight
for the wives and sweethearts

1062
01:11:38,299 --> 01:11:39,883
of the submarine Nerka.

1063
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,052
You'll never see these men again.

1064
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:43,845
The Nerka has been sunk.

1065
01:11:44,055 --> 01:11:46,348
It lies at the bottom of the Bungo Straits.

1066
01:11:46,432 --> 01:11:48,141
They bought it! They chalked us up!

1067
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:50,143
We send you our regrets.

1068
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:53,146
To the relatives of Captain P.J.
Richardson,

1069
01:11:53,231 --> 01:11:58,110
of Officers James Bledsoe,
Gerald Cartwright, Carl Beckman,

1070
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:01,446
of seamen Jessie Warner,
Kraut Mueller, Robert Hendrix.

1071
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:03,448
- "Kraut" Mueller? How could they...
- Listen.

1072
01:12:03,491 --> 01:12:05,700
You'll never see them again.

1073
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:07,327
Think about it.

1074
01:12:07,412 --> 01:12:10,038
Think what your country
has done to these men

1075
01:12:10,123 --> 01:12:11,498
as you listen to the music.

1076
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:14,167
Why, they even named us!
The officers, the crew...

1077
01:12:14,252 --> 01:12:16,169
How could they possibly know?

1078
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:25,679
- Welsh.
- Yes, sir?

1079
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:28,682
Were any dispatches, any messages
sent after we entered Area 7?

1080
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:30,642
No, sir. We cut off all radio transmission.

1081
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:31,726
Captain's orders.

1082
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:35,188
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat in 7?

1083
01:12:35,273 --> 01:12:36,398
That's right, sir.

1084
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:45,198
Mueller!

1085
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:48,160
Yes, sir.

1086
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:51,037
Did you ever
sign your name "Kraut" Mueller?

1087
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,874
Only on that notice I put up
about the Momo destroyer.

1088
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:58,503
Russo!

1089
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,505
Where's Russo?

1090
01:13:01,174 --> 01:13:02,215
Yes, sir?

1091
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,700
The trash you put in the garbage sacks.
How do you weight it?

1092
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:06,386
How do you weight it? Answer me!

1093
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:08,597
Well, some tin cans, broken tools,

1094
01:13:08,681 --> 01:13:10,807
anything I can find
that'll help weight the sacks down, sir.

1095
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:11,933
Does it sink?

1096
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,351
I think so, sir.

1097
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:14,436
You think so?

1098
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,189
Well, I can't say for certain, Mr. Bledsoe.

1099
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,316
Did you dump any sacks
off the Bungo Straits?

1100
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,609
Yes, sir.

1101
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:26,990
What have I done now?

1102
01:13:31,996 --> 01:13:33,663
How do you feel?

1103
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,582
I'm all right.

1104
01:13:36,209 --> 01:13:38,793
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.

1105
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:41,505
The crew must be very happy.

1106
01:13:44,759 --> 01:13:46,092
Aren't you?

1107
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:48,553
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

1108
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,474
It's what I wanted.

1109
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:55,018
I see.

1110
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,856
You're going back to the Straits.

1111
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:01,441
That's right.

1112
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:03,360
What changed your mind?

1113
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,153
I found out how they detected us.

1114
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:06,780
Those fishing barges along the coast

1115
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:08,615
have been picking up our garbage sacks.

1116
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:11,076
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.

1117
01:14:12,495 --> 01:14:13,828
Sure, Jim.

1118
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:16,331
I made the same speech.

1119
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,502
But you and I both know
that the odds are still against us.

1120
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:24,839
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.

1121
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:28,718
Let's not kid ourselves.

1122
01:14:29,512 --> 01:14:32,681
You're going back because
you've been through it.

1123
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:34,766
Because you have to go back.

1124
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,185
You knew all along I would.

1125
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:41,982
Let's say I had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.

1126
01:14:46,237 --> 01:14:47,654
Okay, Rich.

1127
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:52,659
I guess the real reason
I came in here was to tell you that I...

1128
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:54,077
Good luck, Jim.

1129
01:15:35,202 --> 01:15:36,911
Now, we all know they think we're sunk.

1130
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:39,497
There's no
possible way for them to know we're here.

1131
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:42,626
Every angle has been covered,
except the risk of battle.

1132
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,502
We're gonna make that risk pay off.

1133
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:48,882
Any more questions?

1134
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:52,469
There must be something you want to ask.

1135
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,555
Well, sir, we all thought...

1136
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:59,809
Would you mind
stepping over here a moment, sir?

1137
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:06,816
Be my guest, Mr. Bledsoe.

1138
01:16:16,202 --> 01:16:18,620
Thanks, Kohler. A privilege.

1139
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:36,012
Decoy leading as before.

1140
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,437
There she is, the Akikaze.

1141
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,481
Traveling about 30 knots and coming up.

1142
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:51,236
Stand by to surface.

1143
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:53,038
- Stand by to surface!
- Stand by to surface!

1144
01:16:55,408 --> 01:16:56,700
- Surface!
- Surface!

1145
01:16:56,784 --> 01:16:58,910
Blow main ballast, hard rise on planes!

1146
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:06,167
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1147
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:08,169
What is it, sir?

1148
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:10,630
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1149
01:17:10,715 --> 01:17:12,276
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1150
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:41,327
Port side clear, sir!

1151
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:45,039
Steady on course 050!

1152
01:17:45,124 --> 01:17:47,625
- New course 050, sir!
- Very well.

1153
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:52,130
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1154
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,215
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1155
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:58,362
Main engines! All ahead one-third, sir!

1156
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:01,264
Very well. Lookouts to the bridge!

1157
01:18:02,892 --> 01:18:04,184
- Mr. Cartwright.
- Yes, sir.

1158
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:05,477
Same plan of action.

1159
01:18:05,519 --> 01:18:06,978
We'll draw the Akikaze to us

1160
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:09,222
by attacking
the last freighter in the starboard column.

1161
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:13,359
When the Akikaze comes in,
we'll give her a bow shot, as before.

1162
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:15,487
- All tubes ready for firing, sir.
- Very well.

1163
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:24,746
In firing position, Captain.

1164
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,080
Good setup on freighter.

1165
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:27,999
Outer doors open on tubes one and two.

1166
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,335
- Fire one!
- Fire one!

1167
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:31,419
Fire one!

1168
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:34,088
One fired, sir.

1169
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:35,256
One's away, sir.

1170
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,634
Fire two!

1171
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:39,219
- Fire two!
- Fire two!

1172
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:42,138
- Two fired, sir.
- Two's away, sir.

1173
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:45,809
Left 10-degree rudder. Come to course 041.

1174
01:19:26,851 --> 01:19:30,061
Akikaze moving up starboard
side of burning freighter.

1175
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,941
Bearing on Akikaze.

1176
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:38,820
089, sir.

1177
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:40,905
Come right to course 089!

1178
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:42,782
Coming right to course 089, sir!

1179
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:44,200
Very well.

1180
01:19:44,285 --> 01:19:45,285
At what range will we fire, sir?

1181
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:46,870
1,500 yards.

1182
01:19:46,996 --> 01:19:48,276
We'll take her with decks awash.

1183
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:50,790
Shift to battery. All ahead one-third.

1184
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,634
Shifting to battery. All
ahead one-third, sir.

1185
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:53,751
Very well.

1186
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:56,337
- Control room.
- Control room, aye, aye.

1187
01:19:56,422 --> 01:19:57,797
Flood down to 26 feet.

1188
01:19:58,132 --> 01:19:59,173
Aye, aye, sir.

1189
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,843
Open main ballast tank vents,
flood down to 26 feet.

1190
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,013
Range to Akikaze?

1191
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,348
Range, 2,400 yards.

1192
01:20:07,641 --> 01:20:09,559
Use tubes three and four on this run.

1193
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:11,227
Tubes three and four. Aye, aye, sir.

1194
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,405
Rig out bow planes.

1195
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,627
Range, 2,100 yards.

1196
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:39,047
Open outer doors on tubes three and four.

1197
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:42,842
Stand by to fire tubes three and four.

1198
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:44,928
Ready on tubes three and four.

1199
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,012
Outer doors open.

1200
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:50,767
Range, 1,800.

1201
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:52,727
Lookouts below!

1202
01:21:11,956 --> 01:21:13,706
Range, 1,600.

1203
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,043
Commence firing at 1,500.

1204
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:18,878
- Stand by to fire!
- Stand by to fire!

1205
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:31,975
- Fire three!
- Fire three!

1206
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:34,477
Three fired, sir.

1207
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:35,561
Three's away, sir.

1208
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:38,147
- Fire four!
- Fire four!

1209
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:40,483
- Four fired, sir.
- Four's away, sir.

1210
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:42,193
Clear the bridge!

1211
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:45,822
Dive! Dive!

1212
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:53,162
15-degree angle! Take her deep.

1213
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:09,887
That's it! We got her!

1214
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:12,932
- All ahead one-third!
- All ahead one-third!

1215
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:14,934
Level off and bring her up
to periscope depth.

1216
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:17,103
Aye, aye, sir. Flow negative. Level off.

1217
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:19,105
Bring her up to periscope depth.

1218
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:22,150
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1219
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:25,403
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

1220
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:28,614
Take a look.

1221
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:30,700
Sir!

1222
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:32,118
Listen.

1223
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:36,289
That transmission again.
I can't make that out.

1224
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,503
Bledsoe! Take her down!

1225
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:25,588
Sound collision! Take her down fast!

1226
01:23:25,672 --> 01:23:27,131
Sound collision! All ahead full!

1227
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:29,151
Flood negative! Take her down!

1228
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:31,636
Flood negative! Hard dive on planes!

1229
01:23:58,627 --> 01:24:00,307
Torpedo coming down!
It's another runaway!

1230
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:01,916
It can't be! Both of them were hits!

1231
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,170
It's not ours, it's theirs.
It's from another sub.

1232
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:08,256
That's what sunk all our boats.

1233
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,174
A Japanese submarine.

1234
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:27,900
She missed us.

1235
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:31,737
Captain, hadn't you better go below?

1236
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:34,240
Passing 90 feet, sir.

1237
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:37,618
- All ahead one-third!
- All ahead one-third, sir.

1238
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:40,705
- Level off at 120!
- Level off at 120, sir!

1239
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:42,790
Rig ship for silent running!

1240
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:44,250
Rig ship for silent running.

1241
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:45,710
Shift to manual control.

1242
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:46,878
Shut down ventilation.

1243
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,754
Secure all of the machinery.

1244
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:50,756
No unnecessary movement or talking.

1245
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:02,101
Here he is, sir.

1246
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,362
I've lost him.

1247
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:57,657
They've stopped their motors.

1248
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,910
Then let's make it a standoff.

1249
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:03,746
All stop.

1250
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:06,666
All stop, sir.

1251
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:47,123
We can't hold her down too long
without some speed.

1252
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,417
We'll have to start the motors soon.

1253
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:51,127
Let's hope they start theirs first.

1254
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:35,755
What was his last true bearing?

1255
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:37,423
135.

1256
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:40,843
The bearing's no good
without knowing his depth.

1257
01:27:40,927 --> 01:27:42,595
And we can't get that.

1258
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:44,472
We gotta get him to surface.

1259
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:48,142
There's a convoy still up there.

1260
01:27:48,226 --> 01:27:51,520
With the Akikaze gone, he's gonna have to
come up to protect those ships.

1261
01:27:51,605 --> 01:27:53,939
Well, suppose we sink a couple?

1262
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:57,735
I have your permission, sir?

1263
01:27:57,778 --> 01:27:59,111
You're the captain.

1264
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:02,448
- Stand by to surface!
- Standing by to surface, sir!

1265
01:28:02,574 --> 01:28:04,075
Secure from silent running and collision!

1266
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:05,326
Secure from silent running
and collision, sir!

1267
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:06,971
- All ahead full!
- All ahead full, sir!

1268
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:18,273
Reload forward tubes when we surface.

1269
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,007
Reload forward tubes when we surface!

1270
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:29,975
Shift targets.

1271
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:32,978
Angle on the bow,
70 starboard, bearing coming down.

1272
01:28:33,146 --> 01:28:35,064
Commence firing when set.

1273
01:28:35,148 --> 01:28:36,607
- Radar!
- Aye, aye, sir.

1274
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,775
Any sign of that sub?

1275
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:38,859
Not yet, sir.

1276
01:28:38,944 --> 01:28:40,986
- Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1277
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:43,572
- Fire three!
- Fire three!

1278
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:46,659
- Fire four!
- Fire four!

1279
01:28:57,003 --> 01:28:59,004
New radar contact, bearing 303 relative.

1280
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,007
That should be our friend.

1281
01:29:05,303 --> 01:29:06,679
There he is.

1282
01:29:12,185 --> 01:29:13,477
He's changing course.

1283
01:29:14,187 --> 01:29:17,690
He's moving in behind the decoy,
using it as a screen.

1284
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:19,024
Right standard rudder!

1285
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:20,401
Come right to course 069!

1286
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:23,779
Right standard rudder!
Coming right to course 069, sir!

1287
01:29:23,989 --> 01:29:25,322
Very well.

1288
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:28,075
That decoy, you say it has a shallow draft?

1289
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,660
Yeah, that's right.

1290
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:31,387
We could shoot under it and hit the sub.

1291
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,082
Open outer doors on tubes five and six.

1292
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,960
Set torpedo depth at 16 feet.

1293
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:44,341
Steady on new course, sir!

1294
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:49,930
Range, 1,500. Standing by to fire, sir.

1295
01:29:58,315 --> 01:29:59,773
He's all yours, Captain.

1296
01:30:05,405 --> 01:30:06,447
Fire five.

1297
01:30:07,157 --> 01:30:08,657
- Fire five!
- Fire five!

1298
01:30:10,243 --> 01:30:11,410
Five's away, sir.

1299
01:30:12,078 --> 01:30:13,120
Fire six.

1300
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:14,914
- Fire six!
- Fire six!

1301
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:11,387
SJ radar contact! Aircraft, coming in fast!

1302
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:13,305
Clear the deck.

1303
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:16,475
Lookouts below! Hurry! Clear the decks!

1304
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:17,977
Stand by to dive!

1305
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:20,980
Dive! Dive!

1306
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:24,316
Beckman, secure the hatch!

1307
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:52,011
It's 38 days now since
we left Pearl Harbor.

1308
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:54,680
I know how some of us felt then,

1309
01:31:54,764 --> 01:31:56,807
I think I know how some of us feel now.

1310
01:31:58,226 --> 01:32:01,312
But let no one here,
no one aboard this boat,

1311
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:03,272
ever say we didn't have a captain.

1312
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:14,450
"Unto Almighty God we commend
the soul of our shipmate departed,"

1313
01:32:14,534 --> 01:32:17,077
"and we commit his body to the deep,"

1314
01:32:17,162 --> 01:32:21,498
"in the sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection unto eternal life,"

1315
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:24,209
"when the sea shall give up her dead"

1316
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:26,795
"and the life of the world to come."
