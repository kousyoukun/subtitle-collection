1
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,951
Setup on leading freighter.

2
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:00,255
<i>(speaking in Japanese)</i>

3
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:08,555
Range.

4
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,517
- Mark?
- 1-5-0-0.

5
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:16,064
50 port. Open outer doors,
tubes 1 and 2. Stand by.

6
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,101
Open outer doors, 1 and 2. Stand by.

7
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:21,321
Open outer doors on 1 and 2. Stand by.

8
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,989
Firing two fish forward. Watch your depth.

9
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,158
Two degrees down bubble. Hold her at 60.

10
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,206
- Outer doors open on 1 and 2, sir.
- Final bearing.

11
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,669
- Mark.
- 3-2-0.

12
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,464
- Set.
- Fire 1.

13
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:43,384
Fire 1.

14
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:45,504
- 1 is fired, sir.
- Fire 2.

15
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,263
Fire 2.

16
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:50,142
- 2 is fired, sir.
- Time on that first torpedo.

17
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:52,595
Should hit in about 42 seconds, sir.

18
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:12,576
Crash-dive! 300 feet! All ahead full!
Destroyer coming in fast!

19
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,950
Rig for depth charge! Silent running!

20
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,580
<i>- (siren)
- Dive!</i>

21
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:20,082
10... 9... 8... 7... 6...

22
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,256
<i>(explosion)</i>

23
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:17,328
Better hold on to these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.

24
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:20,166
- Why?
- His car had a flat tyre this morning.

25
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,668
Right rear. He's fit to be tied.

26
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,709
- Send 'em tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:27,513
Captain Field's a little touchy
this morning, too.

28
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:29,677
Oh? Another flat tyre?

29
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:33,887
Almost the same thing. His wife.
They had a quarrel last night.

30
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,261
- Oh, that.
- I'm ready for action.

31
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,934
Passing up the decoy, sir. In position.

32
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,308
Heading straight on towards the Akikaze.

33
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,602
- Stand by to dive.
- Aye aye, sir.

34
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:45,445
Range 1800.

35
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:48,325
Akikaze bearing down on us, bow on.

36
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,827
- Clear the bridge. Dive.
- Dive. Ready to shoot in 25 seconds.

37
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,782
Bearing. Mark.

38
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,244
Fire.

39
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,703
Fire 1.

40
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,330
24 seconds, sir.

41
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:02,297
Torpedo running hot, straight and normal.

42
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:05,667
You sunk him again, sir.

43
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:09,420
That makes 200 times
you've sunk Bungo Pete in...

44
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,925
...200 days.

45
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,012
- He only sunk you once!
- Just once.

46
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,184
But it wasn't on a desk.

47
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,600
Where do you get all these things?

48
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:25,021
- Oh, tables, desks.
- Mueller, you're a thief.

49
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:27,194
I'm a collector, sir.

50
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:31,025
Bungo Pete! Let's put him
next to his Akikaze destroyer.

51
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:34,246
The unknown factor.
The sea dragon of Area 7.

52
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:37,042
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area!

53
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,251
<i>Too bad they'll never give you
another chance in that area.</i>

54
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,620
Four submarines sunk
in the Bungo Straits...

55
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,670
<i>...and they keep you behind a desk
for something they can't even figure out!</i>

56
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:50,088
How many subs? You said four, I think.

57
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:53,558
- Yes, sir.
- The count was three a month ago.

58
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:58,145
It's only scuttlebutt, but the word's
around that the last boat sent out...

59
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,312
...was lost three days ago.

60
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:05,025
Get these things outta here!

61
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,402
Mueller...

62
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,575
...when's the next sub due in?

63
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,697
Two weeks, sir. The Nerka.

64
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:20,043
Her skipper was wounded, but
the Executive Officer's due to take over.

65
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,253
- He qualified for command?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:27,129
- They'll send her out to 7.
- I suppose so.

67
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:32,385
Get the Chief of Staff on the phone.
Tell him I'm coming over.

68
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,305
<i>(@ "Anchors Aweigh")</i>

69
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,652
<i>(PA) Executive Officer to duty section.
Now hear this.</i>

70
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,911
The repair crew will take over at 1300.

71
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,660
Duty section will stand by
with the repair list.

72
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,374
You beach boys who'll be checking in
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel...

73
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,829
...the hotel does not have a repair crew.

74
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,966
So have fun,
but keep the damage to a minimum.

75
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:18,055
Break it up, break it up!
Russo, Cullen, break it up! I...

76
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,180
For the next captain of the Nerka, sir.

77
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,187
What we mean to say, Mr Bledsoe...
Congratulations!

78
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,320
<i>(all) Good luck, sir.</i>

79
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:32,148
- So this is the way we start! Bribery!
- Don't know what you mean, sir!

80
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:35,867
Next it'll be special privileges!
Sunbathing, two-hour watches.

81
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,748
A sunburned crew is a happy crew!
An old Navy axiom!

82
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,914
That you just made up!

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,881
Thanks a lot, men. Don't any of you
get the idea I can be had!

84
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,299
- It never entered our heads!
- I'll bet!

85
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,881
- Go on, try it on, sir!
- You'll look very sharp in that rig!

86
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:01,261
- See you a moment, Bledsoe?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,639
Uh, we were just leaving, Captain.

88
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,851
I said we were leaving!

89
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,824
It's... sort of a gift, sir. The men, they...

90
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,991
It's all right. Never mind.

91
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,992
- Any milk left in the galley?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,661
- Oh, it's powdered, sir.
- That'll do.

93
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,586
She belongs to the chief of the boat.
Good-luck token.

94
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,629
The men give her a little... pat
on their way to battle stations.

95
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,587
Interesting.

96
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,760
I'll get the milk, sir.

97
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,976
Ah, submarines. They ruined my liver.

98
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,021
Couldn't take one again.

99
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,436
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique.

100
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,441
- Do you like subs?
- I chose the service, sir.

101
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,613
Of course.

102
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,246
- Good record.
- Thank you, sir.

103
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,245
It's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me!

104
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:07,292
I told you two years ago you were
hot stuff, that you'd have a sub one day.

105
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,665
- Remember?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

106
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,840
Well, you're going to, Jim.

107
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,879
But not this time out.

108
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:17,347
The Nerka is being assigned
to Commander Richardson.

109
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,966
He'll be your skipper for this patrol.

110
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:27,065
You see, Jim, she's going to Area 7.
Richardson is acquainted with the area.

111
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,605
7 is a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year.

112
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,860
All of 'em sunk by an Akikaze
off the Bungo Straits.

113
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:39,120
His sub was the first. The Navy Board
feels he deserves another chance.

114
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:42,829
That command was mine.
Don't they think I can handle her in 7?

115
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,877
Of course not.
Your ability isn't being questioned.

116
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:49,290
- Richardson's suggestion...
- Richardson's suggestion?

117
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:51,500
He presented a very strong case.

118
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,890
This whole thing
is suddenly very clear to me.

119
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,896
- That all, sir?
- That's all.

120
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,360
You won't mind if I keep this
out of mothballs, Captain?

121
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,155
There are other boats besides the Nerka.

122
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,242
Rich?

123
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,361
Rich? Hey, be careful!

124
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:22,533
- What's the matter?
- Like me to fix some lemonade?

125
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,751
Sure, honey, you go ahead.
I'll be down by the time...

126
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:33,630
- Better make enough for three.
- Three?

127
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:37,760
- We have company arriving.
- I can't see anyone like this!

128
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,098
I don't think this is a social visit.

129
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:45,684
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.

130
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,106
Looking for me?

131
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:56,982
- Commander Richardson?
- That's right.

132
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,158
I'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.

133
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,656
A pleasure. Mind throwing me up
that insect spray, Jim?

134
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,496
Excuse me, sir,
but I didn't come to spray insects.

135
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:09,707
Well, it's the leaves you spray.
But it doesn't matter.

136
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,999
- What's on your mind?
- A request, sir.

137
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,176
I'd like you to ask for another Exec.

138
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:18,344
Oh? Just like that, huh?

139
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,632
My privilege, sir. Navy regulations.

140
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:23,935
- I'd have to take it to the Board.
- You went to them before.

141
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:27,348
That's just it. I got what I wanted.
Why should I change it?

142
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:30,982
Maybe I can enlighten you.
The crew's accepted me as its captain.

143
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,938
They have me decked out as a groom.

144
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:36,275
Now you're taking my place,
I'd rather not go to the wedding.

145
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,778
Are we discussing your pride
or are you embarrassed to face them?

146
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:42,154
You'll be facing them in a couple of days.

147
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:45,991
The resentment's going to be
twice as great with me on board.

148
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,368
Mr Bledsoe, let me be honest with you.

149
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,043
I don't care about
their resentment or yours.

150
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:54,423
I wanted a boat. The Board gave it to me.
That's all there is.

151
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:56,378
The Board didn't give you a thing.

152
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:59,929
You went to them, the poor
desk commander with a tear in his eye.

153
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:04,601
<i>You told them if you could have me
for a backstop, you could do the job.</i>

154
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,769
Mr Bledsoe...

155
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:09,354
...your request for release is denied.

156
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,149
<i>(door opens)</i>

157
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:19,365
Well, Commander, I'm glad I came over.

158
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:23,278
- Get things straightened out.
- We're going to get along just fine.

159
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,203
Don't worry, Jim.
I'll take good care of the bride.

160
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,206
Anyone for a slug of gin?
We're out of vermouth.

161
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,579
- Lt Bledsoe, Laura. My Exec.
- Hello.

162
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:35,084
Thanks, Mrs Richardson.
I'll take a rain check on the drink.

163
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:38,054
- Some other time.
- Lieutenant?

164
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,754
If there isn't another time, good luck.

165
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:43,382
Take good care of my husband.

166
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:47,477
I'll take care, ma'am.

167
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,640
- Take over, Mr Conwell.
- Aye aye, sir.

168
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,037
Captain's off the bridge.
It won't be long now.

169
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:46,204
Captain's off the bridge.

170
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,204
- Order's coming up soon, Chief.
- OK, Carver.

171
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:52,752
- Is he downstairs yet?
- Below, Jessie. The Captain's below.

172
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,381
- How much is in the pool?
- 200 bucks. Are all the areas covered?

173
00:13:56,511 --> 00:14:00,424
- I got a five spot on Area 22.
- 16 for me! I hear it's a pleasure cruise!

174
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,264
- I took 7.
- 7?

175
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:04,430
- You what?
- I took 7.

176
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,811
- That's a one-way ticket, idiot!
- Trying to jinx us all?

177
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:12,066
- What do you mean, one-way?
- No return, Jessie. No return.

178
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:17,269
But I was born on the 7th.
What with all that money in the pool, I...

179
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:20,075
7 is lucky for me... ain't it?

180
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,321
The money's all locked up inside.

181
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:28,576
Wilson, tell the engine room
we're standing by.

182
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,794
- Hey, Chief, can I change areas?
- Too late.

183
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,163
Gentlemen, I ask for silence.

184
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,540
The next voice you hear...

185
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,715
...will be the dealer.

186
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,053
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

187
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:47,766
<i>I know all of you are vitally interested
in our area assignment.</i>

188
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:53,352
Here is a rundown of the orders under
which we will operate during this patrol.

189
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:55,442
Number one.

190
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:00,529
<i>And I'm sure you've heard this
many times... sink enemy shipping.</i>

191
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:06,329
<i>Number two... proceed
on a specified course to Area 7...</i>

192
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:10,454
- I knew it! I just knew it!
- For Pete's sake, turn it off!

193
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:16,589
Number three: Avoid the section
in Area 7 known as the Bungo Straits.

194
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:22,593
<i>Number four... take coast intelligence
photos wherever possible.</i>

195
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,887
<i>A third of you are new men, and I know
there are bound to be some questions.</i>

196
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:30,139
<i>Feel free to ask
your division officer any time.</i>

197
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:32,846
<i>That's all. Thanks for your attention.</i>

198
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,107
Hey, where are the Bungo Straits?

199
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:37,275
- Why?
- He said we'll avoid it.

200
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,075
He didn't say anything about avoiding 7.

201
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,951
OK, give everyone back
his money, Kohler.

202
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:45,616
No dice. Somebody took Area 7.

203
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:48,831
<i>- Who?
- He did.</i>

204
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:56,166
Jeez, fellas, I didn't know!
Well, it's my birthday!

205
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:58,043
7's my birthday!

206
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:17,228
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.

207
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:21,146
<i>(Jim) Range 2,000.
All hands standing by for drill.</i>

208
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,952
Bail out. Lookouts, below!

209
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,169
Clear the bridge!

210
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,336
<i>(klaxon)</i>

211
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,511
Dive! Dive!

212
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:52,892
- What's the depth?
- 38 feet, sir.

213
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,934
- Ruby, where's the scope?
- We're not at periscope depth yet.

214
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,906
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface!

215
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:03,071
Now let's get this straight.

216
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:07,068
- I want this scope up as we dive.
- As we dive, sir?

217
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:09,873
I wanna be ready to fire
once we level off at 50 feet.

218
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,410
I know this is new to you,
but you'll have to get used to it.

219
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:17,673
The purpose of this drill is
to dive and fire as soon as we level.

220
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,124
Let's try it again. Surface!

221

- Blow negative!
- Level off. 8-degree angle,

225
00:17:58,006 --> 00:18:01,092
- Depth: 40 feet.
- Steady on course, Captain.

226
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:04,421
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1. Time?

227
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,179
42 seconds, sir.

228
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:09,392
- Not fast enough. Open the vents sooner.
- Aye aye, sir.

229
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:13,018
- Stand by to surface. We'll try it again.
- Stand by to surface.

00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,817
- Open the vents on the diving alarm.
- Taking a chance, isn't it?

233
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:28,822
You can always shut 'em
if you don't get a green board.

234

- Fire 1.

241
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:23,125
- 37 seconds, sir.
- That's good. Very good.

242
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:26,048
By the time we reach Area 7,
I want it down to 33.

243
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,220
- 33, sir?
- 33 is right.

244
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,303
- Yes, sir. Secure from battle stations?
- Yes, Jim.

245
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,970
- Take the conn, Mr Cartwright.
- Secure from battle stations.

246
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:39,269
- Secure. Third section, take watch.
- Secure. Third section, take watch.

247
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,441
All ahead one third.

248
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,610
Light the smoking lamp.

249
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,913
I said secure. Your tails
can't be dragging that much.

250
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,880
What's the matter? No gripes, no groans?

251
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:03,209
Isn't anyone gonna say
it's a four-second difference?

252
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,382
Not a boat in the fleet could make it?

253
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,469
Ruby, you worried about drills?

254
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,554
- No, sir.
- Poplin?

255
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,771
I never keep anything from a crew. I don't
expect 'em to keep anything from me.

256
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,440
So, come on, speak up!

257
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:23,276
Well, I... I guess it's...
It's Area 7, Mr Bledsoe.

258
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:26,276
- You heard the operation orders.
- That's just it, sir.

259
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,824
- They mentioned the Bungo Straits.
- What difference does that make?

260
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:33,868
That's the section where
those subs were lost - the graveyard.

261
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,786
- We've got orders to avoid it.
- The Bungo Straits!

262
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,995
- Well, for Pete's sake!
- Great!

263
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:41,965
- Lieutenant, we thought...
- Don't think.

264
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,542
Grab some coffee.
In 30 minutes, you got another drill.

265
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,172
33 seconds!

266
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:50,305
Leave the hatch open,
the boat might go down faster.

267
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,472
<i>(men continue banter)</i>

268
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,562
I heard you, Lieutenant.

269
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,313
Now that you've explained the orders...

270
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:04,647
...how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?

271
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:19,746
<i>(alarm)</i>

272
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,623
Captain to the bridge!

Easy, fellas! She's gotta last the patrol!
One pat to a customer now!

274
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:38,982
- All ahead, standard on board.
- OK, I got it.

275
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:42,441
Radar contact dead astern, sir.
We think it's a Jap sub.

276
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,320
Has he seen us?

277
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:48,651
Hard to tell. Shall we open
the outer doors on the stern tubes?

278
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:50,824
No. Keep her on present course.

<i>(alarm continues)</i>

Conn, forward torpedo room
manned and ready.

282
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,678
How long shall we hold this course, sir?

283
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:14,006
What?

284
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:16,266
Before we double back to get 'em.

285
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:18,471
We're not going to double back.

286
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,107
- Sir?
- He might get lucky. I'm not risking it.

287
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:25,604
- We're faster. We could outmanoeuvre it.
- Hold her steady.

288
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:28,526
- Aye aye, sir.
- Keep a sharp lookout astern!

289
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:31,327
<i>Lost radar contact at 6-5-0-0 yards, sir.</i>

290
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:34,288
Very well. Secure from battle stations.

291
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,453
Secure from battle stations.

292
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,156
Second section, take the watch.

293
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:44,837
I'll take the conn. Lay below.

294
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:47,005
Aye aye, sir.

295
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:56,597
Well, you've had the boat for a week now.

296
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:59,646
I guess you noticed
how quickly she responds.

297
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:04,269
Always a shudder when you push her
too hard. Best to ease her into it.

298
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:07,487
- Thanks. Anything else?
- Just one thing, sir.

299
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:11,398
She hates showing her backsides
to Japanese submarines.

300
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:14,867
Permission to go below, sir?

301
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,036
Granted.

302
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:24,296
Now hear this, now hear this.
Orders of the day.

303
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:28,752
To your sacks, men. You've got
25 seconds to lay flat on your backs.

Any of you gripers want a sleeping pill?

305
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:34,267
He's a caution. Isn't he a caution!

306
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,634
Give the skipper a couple, will ya?

307
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:40,849
A Jap sub and all these drills.
The Captain must be running scared.

308
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:44,267
Aw, it's the craziest war patrol
I ever started on.

309
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:48,530
Who said anything about a war patrol?
You're all confused, my friend.

310
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:52,985
We're on a drill patrol. First time
in the annals of the Navy Department.

311
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,703
What's it all mean?
What's he got in mind, huh?

312
00:23:56,831 --> 00:24:00,415
Haven't you heard? He's gonna
challenge the Japs to a drill.

313
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:03,912
The winner will get
an all-expense-paid honeymoon...

314
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:06,620
...with Tokyo Rose in the Bungo Straits.

315
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:11,254
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate.
Let us pay tribute to that great motto.

316
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:14,508
"Caution with safety
and safety with caution."

317
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,681
Now. Let's do better than that.

318
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,393
Let's drink a toast to our beloved captain,
the drillmaster!

319
00:24:20,522 --> 00:24:23,642
For he knew our fleet boat
was faster than a Jap sub.

320
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,602
I've had enough kidding, Jerry.

321
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:28,309
Why? A cautious captain
with orders to "avoid"?

322
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,365
If we stay out of Area 7
as well as the Straits, we're in.

323
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:35,075
- I bet he's thinking of a way now!
- Excuse me, sir. Your watch list.

324
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:37,990
What about that, Mueller?
You're chummy with him.

325
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:41,823
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr Cartwright. Do you, sir?

326
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:44,878
Come back here, Kraut!

327
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,082
Get out, Mueller. Go on.

328
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:55,009
If you have any questions, you come
to me, not the crew. Understand?

329
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:58,226
And that goes for your opinions, too.

330
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,721
Maybe we'd better break this up.
It's getting late.

Only the captain gives permission

Yes, sir?

- Over a year, sir.

you usually get?

No, sir.

A man could've been killed today.

358
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:31,902
The responsibility is yours.
You're in charge of the drills.

359
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:36,073
I have no excuses. But under the
circumstances, the crew did their best.

360
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,240
- What circumstances?
- Don't press it.

I want an answer.

362
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:42,988
It's one thing to drill a crew.
But when you duck a Jap sub...

363
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:47,371
...they wonder why they should care when
the Captain has no stomach for attacking.

364
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:49,959
Does he want obedience, efficiency...

365
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,580
...or the best-drilled cowards in the Navy?

366
00:28:55,887 --> 00:29:00,216
Mr Bledsoe, tell them I'm doubling
the drills, starting tomorrow.

367

Yes, sir.

I don't believe it.

from cowardice.

"Dear Commander,

- Right on the pickle, dear friend.

That tin can zigs right into us.
I tell ya, I was shaking!

- What did the old man do?
- Calm, you know. No excitement.

466
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:10,258
Orders two fish right down the throat!
Just like you'd order ham and eggs!

467

If we'd missed, we wouldn't have lived
long enough to get into Area 7!

Jessie! Jessie, dear friend!

476

We've decided to be big about it.

477
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:50,923
We're not gonna hold you responsible
for Area 7 any longer.

478
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:53,299
- We'll take back the money.
- Gosh!

479
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:55,760
Well, that's nice of you fellas...

480
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:59,681
...but my conscience hurt me so much,
I threw it overboard.

481
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:09,692
- Not now, Kohler.
- Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.

482
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:13,536
I've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen 'em together.

483
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:16,036
But I never saw one
run away from a Jap sub...

484
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,867
...then take on a destroyer with a shot
I didn't even know was in the book.

485
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:22,044
There has to be a reason.

486
00:38:24,926 --> 00:38:26,965
That bow shot didn't just happen.

487
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:29,966
The drills were planned for it.
The whole thing was...

488
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,722
<i>(door closes)</i>

489
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:35,891
I never heard of a bow shot
being set up except in desperation.

490
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,060
It's all like some experiment.

491
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,973
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he thought he could get an Akikaze.

492
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,981
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a helluva difference.

493
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:47,521
This Akikaze's in the Bungo Straits.

494
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:50,943
But that's impossible!
The orders say to avoid it!

495
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:55,161
I know.

496
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,664
Look, I know how you feel about him
taking the boat and all.

497
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,715
But don't you think
you're working at it overtime, sir?

498
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,599
We'll be hitting Area 7 tomorrow morning.

499

<i>(radar bleeps)</i>

...six.

503
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,154
It's a convoy all right, sir.
Bearing 3-2-0 relative.

504
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,872
Sounds like a whole lot of 'em, sir.

505
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,423
- Cullen.
- Aye aye, sir.

506
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,592
I have the dive. Depth: 60 feet.

507
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:34,339
- Forward torpedo room ready, sir.
- We're undetected, sir.

508
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,514
Aft torpedo room manned and ready.

509
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:40,143
We're dead ahead of the convoy.
What firing position shall we take?

510
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,352
Captain?

511
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,486
Take her down, sir?

512
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,989
Take her down to 100 feet.

513
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,158
100 feet. Aye aye, sir.

514
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,457
Five degrees down bubble.
Take her to 100 feet.

515
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,452
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.

516
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:05,085
- Come right to course 2-8-0.
- Right to course 2-8-0, sir.

517
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,836
Very well. Mr Cartwright,
take over the conn.

518
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,166
Yes, sir.

519
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,545
What's he doing? What's going on?

520
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,426
- Give me a line on course 2-8-0.
- Sir?

521
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:22,433
- A line on course 2-8-0 now!
- Aye aye, sir.

522
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:25,483
- What's the skipper up...
- Later, Beckman.

523
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,395
- Start levelling off.
- Aye aye, sir.

524
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:48,288
There it is. You might as well post it.

525
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:52,921
A whole area to patrol and you pick
the graveyard - the Bungo Straits!

526
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:56,515
It's the only place we can get the Akikaze.

527
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,681
The one spot you're ordered to avoid.

528
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,847
You make it sound like
a snap decision. It wasn't.

529
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,193
That's quite obvious. Passing
a Jap submarine to save your torpedoes.

530
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,019
Risking a bow shot. Ducking a convoy
so they can't radio our position.

531
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:13,690
You planned it, all right! You knew it
the day I came to your house!

532
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:17,741
I knew it before that, Jim. I knew it
a year ago when my boat went down.

533
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:22,368
We have explicit orders. We have a crew
that expects the captain to follow them!

534
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:24,957
You know that a captain
can redefine orders...

535
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:27,127
...if he feels he has an advantage.

536
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,583
- What advantage?
- You named it. A bow shot.

537
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,043
We did it with a Momo.
We can do it again.

538
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:36,390
You call that an advantage when
four subs before us never had a chance?

539
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:39,517
They were detected.
Not even Pearl knows where we are.

540
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:41,684
What about the Japanese navy?

541
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:44,933
<i>No, sir, that's no advantage.
Not in my book.</i>

542
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:47,106
But you're not the captain.

543
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,739
If you should fail
but come out of this alive...

544
00:42:50,864 --> 00:42:54,031
...there won't be a desk
small enough for you this time!

545
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,991
That's strange, Jim.
I never even thought of failing.

546
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:03,198
You've got a lot of guts, sir,
with other people's lives.

547
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:05,577
That's my decision and my responsibility!

548
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:07,789
To whom? To a crew
that died a year ago?

549
00:43:07,923 --> 00:43:10,593
Yes! To a dead crew, a dead sub!

550
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:17,304
Now, believe what you want.

551
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:22,768
Well, this crew's still alive.

552
00:43:22,897 --> 00:43:27,273
They have a right to know where
they're going. Do I have to tell them?

553
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:31,316
What's the matter? Surely
you've got guts enough for this, too.

554
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:36,072
This is the Captain.

555
00:43:36,202 --> 00:43:38,871
Due to conditions of special advantage...

556
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:42,531
...I have decided to take this boat
to the Bungo Straits.

557
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:16,610
Bungo Straits, broad on the port beam.

558
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:30,003
We're there.

559
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:34,174
Bungo Straits.

560
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:37,010
We're at the Straits.

561
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:41,096
Bungo Straits.

562
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:44,054
Bungo Straits.

563
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:47,225
Bungo Straits.

564
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:54,151
We're there. We're in the Straits.

565
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:01,028
If I'd only been born on the 8th.

566
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:04,747
Uh, see you a moment, sir?

567
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:16,592
- What is this?
- We, uh... want to talk to you, Jim.

568
00:45:16,721 --> 00:45:19,924
- I looked through the Navy rules.
- We want you to take over.

569
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:25,475
That's very flattering, gentlemen.

570
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:27,433
Let's go. Everyone outside.

571
00:45:27,565 --> 00:45:29,688
- They're Navy orders!
- What right...

572
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:32,106
A captain's right. That's all he needs.

573
00:45:32,238 --> 00:45:34,276
We might as well
make up our minds now.

574
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:37,242
- We'll follow his orders.
- Where? To the bottom?

575
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:40,238
If that's what he's got in mind,
that's where we'll go.

576
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:42,826
This boat - any boat - has one captain.

577
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,872
Is that right, Kohler?

578
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,496
Yes, sir.

579
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,129
- Is that right, Mr Cartwright?
- Yes, sir.

580
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:55,298
Let's break this up.

581
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,813
Mr Cartwright, with all due respect
to your rank...

582
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:12,611
...may I say that I think you're an ass?

583
00:46:14,155 --> 00:46:17,855
I see by this report that
you called Mr Cartwright an ass.

584
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:20,032
- Yes, sir.
- An officer?

585
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,988
That's right, sir.

586
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:25,455
- Mueller, you're a damn fool.
- Yes, sir, I know.

587
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,869
But as long as I overheard,
you might as well know, too.

588
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,921
They wanted Mr Bledsoe to take over.

589
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:34,718
- He put an end to that fast.
- He would.

590
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:38,591
- Would you tell me something?
- If I can, sir.

591
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:41,842
- Am I a damn fool, too?
- Sir?

592
00:46:41,974 --> 00:46:46,636
Mr Bledsoe seems to think I am,
and I have a great respect for his opinion.

593
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:50,056
Maybe you have to be, Captain,
to do something like this.

594
00:46:50,192 --> 00:46:53,892
You nailed that Momo with a bow shot.
Why not the Akikaze?

595
00:46:54,029 --> 00:46:57,362
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller. Never.

596
00:46:57,491 --> 00:46:59,946
Well, he will this time, sir.

597
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:03,945
Is that a classified opinion
or am I at liberty to repeat it?

598
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:06,120
It's a fact, sir.

599
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,618
A fact they'll all realise
at Bungo Pete's funeral!

00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,568
That's a decoy. Shallow craft.
Used to draw fire away from the convoy.

605
00:48:15,946 --> 00:48:19,445
You could shoot ten fish.
They'd only run under it.

606
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,500
There! There she is,
pulling up to the convoy!

607
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:32,454
- The Akikaze.
- Yes.

608
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:35,459
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.

609
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:38,628
Look at her cut through there!
Must be making 30 knots!

610
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:41,796
Doesn't stay in position long enough
to give you a target.

611
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:43,971
Not unless he's coming toward you.

612
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:48,561
Take over in the conning tower. Track
the next-to-last ship in the port column.

613
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:51,724
We'll give you a bearing.
Right standard rudder!

614
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:53,897
Very well.

615
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:03,527
This is the Captain. The convoy we've
been waiting for is on our starboard bow.

616
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:08,158
<i>The plan of attack is as follows.
First, we'll strike a freighter going in.</i>

617
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,162
<i>If that doesn't bring
the Akikaze toward us...</i>

618
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:14,046
<i>... we'll attack the freighter nearest him.</i>

619
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:18,122
<i>When the Akikaze does head toward us,
we'll dive and give him two fish...</i>

620
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,585
<i>... at 1500 yards, just like the Momo.</i>

621
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,760
Let's go! All ahead standard.

622
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:24,846
- All ahead standard, sir.
- Very well.

623
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:36,694
How's the target course
and speed check with the TDC?

624
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:39,393
Course checks. Speed, one knot slower.

625
00:49:43,536 --> 00:49:46,074
Plane contact, sir.

Lookouts, planes coming in.
Watch for them.

629
00:49:55,756 --> 00:49:57,547

- Planes closing fast, sir.
- The Japs must've known we were here.

633

We're going in according to plan.

01:05:02,223 --> 01:05:04,263
No.

758
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:09,516
You'd better worry about yourself.
You'll be in for a rough time.

759
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:13,146
Hendrix knows his stuff.
You've had a pretty bad concussion.

760
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,277
It's worse than that.
There's a medical term for it...

761
01:05:16,404 --> 01:05:20,652
...but it all adds up to blacking out
now and then for quite a while.

762
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:25,612
If you don't keep off your feet, sir,
you'll be blacking out permanently!

763
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,958
- You'll keep this to yourselves.
- But, sir...

764
01:05:32,087 --> 01:05:34,127
That's an order, Hendrix.

765
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:40,341
Send for Mr Bledsoe.

766
01:05:41,931 --> 01:05:44,468
- Well, go on!
- Yes, sir.

767
01:06:12,712 --> 01:06:16,412
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.

768
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,255
We'll have to set up
a jury-rig for the radio...

769
01:06:19,385 --> 01:06:21,794
...and the radar needs some work, too.

770
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:23,970
That's another 24 hours.

771
01:06:24,098 --> 01:06:29,556
Not bad, considering. We'll lay over
for two days, then we can get moving.

772
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:34,848
Yeah, the timing's perfect.
Those convoys come out every 48 hours.

773
01:06:36,736 --> 01:06:40,022
- You really got shook up, didn't you?
- No.

774
01:06:40,156 --> 01:06:44,402
- No, I couldn't feel better.
- Then maybe I didn't hear you right.

775
01:06:44,536 --> 01:06:47,822
You heard me right.
I'm talking about the Straits.

776
01:06:47,956 --> 01:06:50,494
Going back to the Bungo Straits.

777
01:06:55,255 --> 01:06:58,340
We're through playing with lives.
It's the end of the line.

778
01:06:58,466 --> 01:07:00,625
Why? Because a torpedo went wild?

779
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,217
You know that's 100 to 1, an accident.

780
01:07:03,347 --> 01:07:08,138
The whole Japanese air force...
dropping everything it's got.

781
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:12,432
- That's an accident, too?
- Next time around, we'll make it.

782
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:17,980
What are you gonna do? Swim back
to the Straits or use a lifeboat?

783
01:07:18,112 --> 01:07:21,113
Because that's all the help
you're gonna get.

784
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:26,118
Those are tall words.
You'd better stop and think a minute.

785
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:30,574
I have thought about it. That wasn't
a tea party the crew held before.

786
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:34,456
They wanted me to take over then.
They'll feel the same way now.

787
01:07:34,587 --> 01:07:39,084
You make one move to take over and,
I swear, I'll see that you're hung!

788
01:07:39,216 --> 01:07:43,546
Then we'll hang together. Orders
were disobeyed. No more technicalities.

789
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,594
A fleet boat of the Navy,
a sub with her fighting power intact...

790
01:07:47,726 --> 01:07:49,765
...and you'd take her back to Pearl?

791
01:07:49,894 --> 01:07:51,602
I don't believe it!

792
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:59,608
Mr Cartwright!

793
01:08:05,368 --> 01:08:07,409
Yes, sir?

794
01:08:07,537 --> 01:08:11,451
We'll lay over two days for repairs
before returning to Pearl.

795
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:13,410
I'll be in command.

796
01:08:13,543 --> 01:08:15,786
Get a detail started right away.

797
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:19,254
- Yes, sir.
- That's all, Cartwright.

798
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,799
Yes, sir.

799
01:08:26,974 --> 01:08:29,726
The best Exec I could get
in the whole Navy!

800
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,891
The backstop, I think you said!

801
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:36,268
And the first command you give
as a captain is to order a retreat!

802
01:09:00,008 --> 01:09:04,136
<i>@ Goodbye, Bungo! Hello, Pearl!</i>

803
01:09:04,262 --> 01:09:07,347
- Funny, funny, funny!
- Aw, what's with you?

804
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:09,632
We're trying to eat. Knock it off.

805
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:13,219
- Is this a private dining room?
- Wanna sing? Go to the head!

806
01:09:13,354 --> 01:09:15,928
<i>Lt'll take more than you to put me there!</i>

807
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:18,984
Break it up!
What's the matter with you guys?

808
01:09:19,111 --> 01:09:21,518
We're going back to Pearl, aren't we?

809
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:27,442
How many patrols have you had,
Mr Sears Roebuck?

810
01:09:27,578 --> 01:09:31,077
- This is my second.
- Well, I've had five since '42.

811
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:34,492
I've taken depth charges,
shells, strafings...

812
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:37,497
...even a bombing run off the Solomons.

813
01:09:37,629 --> 01:09:42,091
This is the first time I've gone back
to Pearl with 15 torpedoes still aboard.

814
01:09:43,343 --> 01:09:46,013
Kohler, better start the torpedo check.

815
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:48,215
- Aye aye, sir.
- Mr Cartwright?

816
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:51,019
- Do you think we could've had 'im?
- What?

817
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:53,812
Suppose that fish hadn't gone wild, sir.

818
01:09:53,937 --> 01:09:58,350
You think that aircraft was playing
games? The Japs had us detected.

819
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:01,058
- The Captain said...
- He's flat on his back.

820
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,686
Be better if somebody
had put him there sooner.

821
01:10:03,822 --> 01:10:06,444
- Kohler, get started.
- Mr Cartwright...

822
01:10:06,576 --> 01:10:09,031
This time words just fail me!

823
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,129
- It's this way, sir. I...
- Why didn't you stop it?

824
01:10:18,254 --> 01:10:21,124
- I didn't know it was gonna happen.
- You let it go on.

825
01:10:21,257 --> 01:10:23,464
- No, sir...
- Then it didn't happen?

826
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,262
If I have to put every crew member
on report, I will!

827
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:28,428
It was my fault, sir.

828
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:33,135
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the OD you're on report.

829
01:10:34,062 --> 01:10:36,102
- Sir...
- What did you say?

830
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:39,896
I told you once
to keep your opinions to yourself!

831
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:42,066
Now get out of here!

832
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:44,235
Yes, sir.

833
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:51,576
I'm not going to stand for
any fighting or insubordination.

834
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:55,868
If you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken! You hear?

835
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:03,205
Wow! How about that?
Chewing out an officer in front of us!

836
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:07,469
He was chewing us all out.
What's he so sore at us for?

837
01:11:08,763 --> 01:11:10,674
<i>(band music on radio)</i>

838
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,351
- Turn it up a bit, huh?
- It's OK. Let's leave it.

839
01:11:19,816 --> 01:11:22,569
What are you trying to do -
break the plate?

840
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:28,616
<i>(radio) You are listening once again
to the voice you call Tokyo Rose.</i>

841
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,783
- Turn it off.
- Yes, sir.

842
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:35,242
<i>I play the music for the wives and
sweethearts of the submarine Nerka.</i>

843
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:39,324
<i>You'll never see these men again.
The Nerka has been sunk.</i>

844
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:43,506
<i>- It's at the bottom of the Bungo Straits.
- They bought it. They chalked us up.</i>

845
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:47,761
<i>We send our regrets to the relatives
of Captain PJ Richardson...</i>

846
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:51,422
<i>... of officers James Bledsoe,
Gerald Cartwright...</i>

<i>... Carl Beckman.</i>

848

<i>Of seamen Jessie Warner,
Kraut Mueller...</i>

849
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,680
- Kraut Mueller? How...
- Listen!

850
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,732
<i>You'll never see them again.
Think about it.</i>

851
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:04,730
<i>Think what your country
has done to these men...</i>

852
01:12:04,864 --> 01:12:06,902
<i>... as you listen to the music.</i>

853
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:09,523
They even named us!
The officers, the crew!

854
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,699
How could they possibly know?

855
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,830
- Welsh?
- Yes, sir?

856
01:12:20,963 --> 01:12:23,833
Were any messages sent
after we entered Area 7?

857
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:27,050
No, sir. We cut off all transmission.
Captain's orders.

858
01:12:27,178 --> 01:12:30,381
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat?

859
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,554
That's right, sir.

860
01:12:39,023 --> 01:12:41,062
Mueller!

861
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:43,270
Yes, sir?

862
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:46,072
Did you ever sign your name
"Kraut" Mueller?

863
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:49,696
Only on that notice I put up
about the Momo destroyer.

864
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:54,656
Russo?

865
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:57,031
- Where's Russo?
- Yes, sir?

866
01:12:57,167 --> 01:13:00,037
The trash you put in the sacks -
how do you weight it?

867
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:03,752
- How do you weight it? Answer me!
- Tin cans, broken tools.

868
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:07,251
- Anything I can find to weight it down.
- Does it sink?

869
01:13:07,386 --> 01:13:09,425
<i>- I think so, sir.
- You think so?</i>

870
01:13:09,554 --> 01:13:12,010
Well, I can't say for certain, Mr Bledsoe.

871
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,382
Did you dump any sacks off the Straits?

872
01:13:14,517 --> 01:13:16,557
Yes, sir.

873
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:22,312
What have I done now?

874
01:13:27,156 --> 01:13:29,195
How do you feel?

875
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:31,151
I'm all right.

876
01:13:31,284 --> 01:13:34,405
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.

877
01:13:34,537 --> 01:13:37,409
- The crew must be very happy.
- Uh-huh.

878
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:42,878
Aren't you?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

879
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:47,046
That's what I wanted.

880
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:51,384
I see.

881
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:55,801
- You're going back to the Straits.
- That's right.

882
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:57,974
What changed your mind?

883
01:13:58,103 --> 01:14:00,180
I found out how they detected us.

884
01:14:00,314 --> 01:14:04,015
Those fishing barges along the coast
have been picking up our garbage.

885
01:14:04,151 --> 01:14:07,437
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.

886
01:14:07,571 --> 01:14:09,398
Sure, Jim.

887
01:14:09,532 --> 01:14:11,572
I made the same speech.

888
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:16,162
But you and I both know that
the odds are still against us.

889
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:20,203
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.

890
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:24,334
Let's not kid ourselves.

891
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:27,667
You're going back
because you've been through it...

892
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,840
<i>...because you have to go back.</i>

893
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,510
You knew all along I would.

894
01:14:32,638 --> 01:14:37,681
Let's say I had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.

895
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,271
OK, Rich.

896
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:47,562
I guess the real reason I came in here
was to tell you that I...

897
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:49,570
Good luck, Jim.

898
01:15:30,114 --> 01:15:34,443
We know they think we're sunk. There's
no way for them to know we're here.

899
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:37,862
Every angle has been covered
except the risk of battle.

900
01:15:37,997 --> 01:15:40,240
We're gonna make that risk pay off.

901
01:15:42,126 --> 01:15:44,166
Any more questions?

902
01:15:45,672 --> 01:15:48,163
There must be something you wanna ask.

903
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:50,541
Well, sir, we all thought...

904
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:55,090
Would you mind
stepping over here a moment, sir?

905
01:16:00,312 --> 01:16:02,351
Be my guest, Mr Bledsoe.

906
