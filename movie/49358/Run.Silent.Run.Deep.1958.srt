1
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,345
Setup on leading freighter.

2
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,186
Range.

3
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,986
- Mark?
- 1-5-0-0.

4
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,386
50 port. Open outer doors,
tubes 1 and 2. Stand by.

5
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,341
Open outer doors, 1 and 2. Stand by.

6
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,824
Firing two fish forward. Watch your depth.

7
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,862
Two degrees down bubble. Hold her at 60.

8
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,744
- Outer doors open on 1 and 2, sir.
- Final bearing.

9
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,066
- Mark.
- 3-2-0.

10
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,746
- Set.
- Fire 1.

11
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,621
- 1 is fired, sir.
- Fire 2.

12
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,069
- 2 is fired, sir.
- Time on that first torpedo.

13
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,420
Should hit in about 42 seconds, sir.

14
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,583
Crash-dive! 300 feet! All ahead full!
Destroyer coming in fast!

15
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,860
Rig for depth charge! Silent running!

16
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,423
Dive!

17
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,781
10... 9... 8... 7... 6...

18
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,223
Better hold on to these reports
to Admiral Bowers, sir.

19
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,944
- Why?
- His car had a flat tyre this morning.

20
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,345
Right rear. He's fit to be tied.

21
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,301
- Send 'em tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,990
Captain Field's a little touchy
this morning, too.

23
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,066
Another flat tyre?

24
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,103
Almost the same thing. His wife.
They had a quarrel last night.

25
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,380
- Oh, that.
- I'm ready for action.

26
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,944
Passing up the decoy, sir. In position.

27
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,220
Heading straight on towards the Akikaze.

28
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,420
- Stand by to dive.
- Aye aye, sir.

29
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,188
Range 1800.

30
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,949
Akikaze bearing down on us, bow on.

31
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,268
- Clear the bridge. Dive.
- Ready to shoot in 25 seconds.

32
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,142
Bearing. Mark.

33
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,544
Fire.

34
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,944
Fire 1.

35
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,503
24 seconds, sir.

36
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,349
Torpedo running hot, straight and normal.

37
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,581
You sunk him again, sir.

38
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,180
That makes 200 times
you've sunk Bungo Pete in...

39
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,583
200 days.

40
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,543
- He only sunk you once!
- Just once.

41
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,626
But it wasn't on a desk.

42
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,860
Where do you get all these things?

43
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,141
- Tables, desks.
- Mueller, you're a thief.

44
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,226
I'm a collector, sir.

45
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,899
Bungo Pete! Let's put him
next to his Akikaze destroyer.

46
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,988
The unknown factor.
The sea dragon of Area 7.

47
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,670
There's nothing superhuman
about him or the area.

48
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,748
Too bad they'll never give <i>you</i>
another chance in that area.

49
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,020
Four submarines sunk
in the Bungo Straits,

50
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,904
and they keep you behind a desk
for something <i>they</i> can't even figure out.

51
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,181
How many subs? You said four, I think.

52
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,509
- Yes, sir.
- The count was three a month ago.

53
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,908
It's only scuttlebutt, but the word's around
that the last boat sent out

54
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,986
was lost three days ago.

55
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,506
Get these things outta here!

56
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,622
Mueller,

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,706
when's the next sub due in?

58
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,741
Two weeks, sir. The Nerka.

59
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,909
Her skipper was wounded, but
the Executive Officer's due to take over.

60
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,988
- He qualified for command?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,705
- They'll send her out to 7.
- I suppose so.

62
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,746
Get the Chief of Staff on the phone.
Tell him I'm coming over.

63
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,141
<i>Executive Officer to duty section.</i>
<i>Now hear this.</i>

64
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,306
The repair crew will take over at 1300.

65
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,944
Duty section will stand by
with the repair list.

66
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,506
You beach boys who'll be checking in
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel,

67
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,860
the hotel does not have a repair crew.

68
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,868
So have fun,
but keep the damage to a minimum.

69
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,667
Break it up! Russo, Cullen, break it up! I...

70
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,499
For the next captain of the Nerka, sir.

71
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,383
What we mean to say, Mr Bledsoe...
Congratulations!

72
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,388
Good luck, sir.

73
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,059
- So this is the way we start! Bribery!
- Don't know what you mean, sir!

74
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,626
Next it'll be special privileges!
Sunbathing, two-hour watches.

75
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,389
A sunburned crew is a happy crew!
An old Navy axiom!

76
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,466
That you just made up!

77
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,106
Thanks a lot, men. Don't any of you
get the idea I can be had.

78
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,425
- It never entered our heads.
- I'll bet!

79
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,860
- Go on, try it on, sir.
- You'll look very sharp in that rig.

80
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,979
- See you a moment, Bledsoe?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,260
We were just leaving, Captain.

82
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,381
I said we were leaving!

83
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,028
It's sort of a gift, sir. The men, they...

84
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,106
It's all right. Never mind.

85
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,983
- Any milk left in the galley?
- Yes, sir.

86
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,544
- Oh, it's powdered, sir.
- That'll do.

87
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,308
She belongs to the chief of the boat.
Good-luck token.

88
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,184
The men give her a little... pat
on their way to battle stations.

89
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,062
Interesting.

90
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,146
I'll get the milk, sir.

91
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,026
Submarines. They ruined my liver.

92
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,946
Couldn't take one again.

93
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,221
Terrible thought. Makes me old.
Makes me antique.

94
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,103
- Do you like subs?
- I chose the service, sir.

95
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,186
Of course.

96
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,546
- Good record.
- Thank you, sir.

97
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,423
It's a fact, not a compliment,
so don't thank me.

98
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,304
I told you two years ago you were
hot stuff, that you'd have a sub one day.

99
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,580
- Remember?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

100
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,666
Well, you're going to, Jim.

101
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,621
But not this time out.

102
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,947
The Nerka is being assigned
to Commander Richardson.

103
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,459
He'll be your skipper for this patrol.

104
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,267
You see, Jim, she's going to Area 7.
Richardson is acquainted with the area.

105
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,621
7 is a hot spot.
We lost four subs there the last year.

106
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,742
All of 'em sunk by an Akikaze
off the Bungo Straits.

107
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,829
His sub was the first. The Navy Board
feels he deserves another chance.

108
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,386
That command was mine.
Don't they think I can handle her in 7?

109
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,308
Of course not.
Your ability isn't being questioned.

110
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,103
It's just that Richardson's suggestion...

111
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,701
He presented a very strong case.

112
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,828
This whole thing
is suddenly very clear to me.

113
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,670
- That all, sir?
- That's all.

114
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,828
You won't mind if I keep this
out of mothballs, Captain?

115
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,510
There are other boats besides the Nerka.

116
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,428
Rich?

117
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,423
Hey, be careful!

118
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,462
- What's the matter?
- Like me to fix some lemonade?

119
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,548
Sure, honey, you go ahead.
I'll be down by the time...

120
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,103
- Better make enough for three.
- Three?

121
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,064
- We have company arriving.
- I can't see anyone like this!

122
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,306
I don't think this is a social visit.

123
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,664
You'd better put some gin
in that lemonade.

124
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,946
Looking for me?

125
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,499
- Commander Richardson?
- That's right.

126
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,586
I'm Bledsoe. Jim Bledsoe.

127
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,941
A pleasure. Mind throwing me up
that insect spray, Jim?

128
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,664
Excuse me, sir,
but I didn't come to spray insects.

129
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,703
Well, it's the leaves you spray.
But it doesn't matter.

130
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,819
- What's on your mind?
- A request, sir.

131
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,906
I'd like you to ask for another Exec.

132
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,186
- Just like that, huh?
- My privilege, sir. Navy regulations.

133
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,347
- I'd have to take it to the Board.
- You went to them before.

134
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,621
That's just it. I got what I wanted.
Why should I change it?

135
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,106
Maybe I can enlighten you.
The crew's accepted me as its captain.

136
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,982
They have me decked out as a groom.

137
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,182
Now you're taking my place,
I'd rather not go to the wedding.

138
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,541
Are we discussing your pride
or are you embarrassed to face them?

139
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,820
You'll be facing them in a couple of days.

140
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,499
The resentment's going to be
twice as great with me on board.

141
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,780
Mr Bledsoe, let me be honest with you.

142
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,344
I don't care about
their resentment or yours.

143
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,587
I wanted a boat. The Board gave it to me.
That's all there is.

144
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,462
The Board didn't give you a thing.

145
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,866
You went to them, the poor
desk commander with a tear in his eye.

146
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,347
You told them if you could have <i>me</i>
for a backstop, you could do the job.

147
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,426
Mr Bledsoe,

148
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,905
your request for release is denied.

149
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,505
Well, Commander, I'm glad I came over.

150
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,259
- Get things straightened out.
- We're going to get along just fine.

151
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,063
Don't worry, Jim.
I'll take good care of the bride.

152
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,943
Anyone for a slug of gin?
We're out of vermouth.

153
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,220
- Lt Bledsoe, Laura. My Exec.
- Hello.

154
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,581
Thanks, Mrs Richardson.
I'll take a rain check on the drink.

155
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,429
- Some other time.
- Lieutenant?

156
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,018
If there isn't another time, good luck.

157
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,539
Take good care of my husband.

158
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,466
I'll take care, ma'am.

159
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,738
- Take over, Mr Conwell.
- Aye aye, sir.

160
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,708
Captain's off the bridge.
It won't be long now.

161
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,786
Captain's off the bridge.

162
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,663
- Order's coming up soon, Chief.
- OK, Carver.

163
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,066
- Is he downstairs yet?
- Below, Jessie. The Captain's below.

164
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,546
- How much is in the pool?
- 200 bucks. Are all the areas covered?

165
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,424
- I got a five spot on Area 22.
- 16 for me! I hear it's a pleasure cruise!

166
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,188
I took 7.

167
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,346
- You what?
- I took 7.

168
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,507
- That's a one-way ticket, idiot!
- Trying to jinx us all?

169
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,589
- What do you mean, one-way?
- No return, Jessie. No return.

170
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,579
But I was born on the 7th.
What with all that money in the pool, I...

171
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,270
7 is lucky for me, ain't it?

172
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,300
The money's all locked up inside.

173
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,422
Wilson, tell the engine room
we're standing by.

174
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,508
- Hey, Chief, can I change areas?
- Too late.

175
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,780
Gentlemen, I ask for silence.

176
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,060
The next voice you hear

177
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,146
will be the dealer.

178
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,347
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

179
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,826
<i>I know all of you are vitally interested</i>
<i>in our area assignment.</i>

180
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:15,183
Here is a rundown of the orders under
which we will operate during this patrol.

181
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,187
Number one.

182
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,065
<i>And I'm sure you've heard this</i>
<i>many times: Sink enemy shipping.</i>

183
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,628
<i>Number two: Proceed</i>
<i>on a specified course to Area 7...</i>

184
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,584
- I knew it! I just knew it!
- For Pete's sake, turn it off!

185
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,467
Number three: Avoid the section
in Area 7 known as the Bungo Straits.

186
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,225
<i>Number four: Take coast intelligence</i>
<i>photos wherever possible.</i>

187
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,343
<i>A third of you are new men, and I know</i>
<i>there are bound to be some questions.</i>

188
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,462
<i>Feel free to ask</i>
<i>your division officer any time.</i>

189
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,058
<i>That's all. Thanks for your attention.</i>

190
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,226
Hey, where are the Bungo Straits?

191
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,306
- Why?
- He said we'll avoid it.

192
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,990
He didn't say anything about avoiding 7.

193
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,749
OK, give everyone back
his money, Kohler.

194
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,304
No dice. Somebody took Area 7.

195
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,388
- Who?
- <i>He</i> did.

196
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,422
Jeez, fellas, I didn't know!
Well, it's my birthday!

197
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,222
7's my birthday!

198
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,621
Simulated target dead ahead, sir.

199
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,379
<i>Range 2,000. All hands</i>
<i>standing by for drill.</i>

200
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,070
Bail out. Lookouts, below!

201
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,786
Clear the bridge!

202
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,786
Dive! Dive!

203
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,824
- What's the depth?
- 38 feet, sir.

204
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,659
- Ruby, where's the scope?
- We're not at periscope depth yet.

205
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,746
Stand by to surface.

206
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,586
Now let's get this straight.

207
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,419
- I want this scope up as we dive.
- As we dive, sir?

208
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,110
I wanna be ready to fire
once we level off at 50 feet.

209
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,501
I know this is new to you,
but you'll have to get used to it.

210
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,589
The purpose of this drill is
to dive and fire as soon as we level.

211
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,940
Let's try it again. Surface!

212
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,943
Blow main ballast. Hard rise on planes.

213
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,140
- Blow negative!
- Level off. 8-degree angle,

214
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,228
- Depth: 40 feet.
- Steady on course, Captain.

215
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,422
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1. Time?

216
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,108
42 seconds, sir.

217
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,188
- Not fast enough. Open the vents sooner.
- Aye aye, sir.

218
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,665
Stand by to surface. We'll try it again.

219
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,582
<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

220
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,941
- Open the vents on the diving alarm.
- Taking a chance, isn't it?

221
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,823
You can always shut 'em
if you don't get a green board.

222
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,508
Aye aye, sir.

223
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,628
Dive! Dive!

224
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,469
Open 'em up! Flood those tanks!

225
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,626
<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

226
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,385
- Mark: 50. Levelled off.
- Fire 1.

227
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,901
- 37 seconds, sir.
- That's good. Very good.

228
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,703
By the time we reach Area 7,
I want it down to 33.

229
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,786
- 33, sir?
- 33 is right.

230
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,743
- Yes, sir. Secure from battle stations?
- Yes, Jim.

231
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,260
- Take the conn, Mr Cartwright.
- Secure from battle stations.

232
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,540
Secure. Third section, take watch.

233
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,466
All ahead one third.

234
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,546
Light the smoking lamp.

235
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,304
I said secure. Your tails
can't be dragging that much.

236
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,149
What's the matter? No gripes, no groans?

237
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,342
Isn't anyone gonna say
it's a four-second difference?

238
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,426
Not a boat in the fleet could make it?

239
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,427
Ruby, you worried about drills?

240
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,386
- No, sir.
- Poplin?

241
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,389
I never keep anything from a crew. I don't
expect 'em to keep anything from me.

242
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,989
So, come on, speak up!

243
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,585
Well, I... I guess it's...
It's Area 7, Mr Bledsoe.

244
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,463
- You heard the operation orders.
- That's just it, sir.

245
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,866
- They mentioned the Bungo Straits.
- What difference does that make?

246
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,744
That's the section where
those subs were lost - the graveyard.

247
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,543
- We've got orders to avoid it.
- The Bungo Straits!

248
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,661
- Well, for Pete's sake!
- Great!

249
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,509
- Lieutenant, we thought...
- Don't think.

250
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,940
Grab some coffee.
In 30 minutes, you got another drill.

251
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,503
33 seconds!

252
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,508
Leave the hatch open,
the boat might go down faster.

253
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,426
I heard you, Lieutenant.

254
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,064
Now that you've explained the orders,

255
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,262
how do you explain
the purpose of these drills?

256
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,542
Captain to the bridge!

257
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,826
Easy, fellas! She's gotta last the patrol.
One pat to a customer now.

258
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,189
- All ahead, standard on board.
- OK, I got it.

259
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,507
Radar contact dead astern, sir.
We think it's a Jap sub.

260
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,268
Has he seen us?

261
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,462
Hard to tell. Shall we open
the outer doors on the stern tubes?

262
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,546
No. Keep her on present course.

263
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,463
Conning tower,
aft engine room manned and ready.

264
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,024
Conn, forward torpedo room
manned and ready.

265
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,505
How long shall we hold this course, sir?

266
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,946
Before we double back to get 'em.

267
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,061
We're not going to double back.

268
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,548
- Sir?
- He might get lucky. I'm not risking it.

269
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,901
- We're faster. We could outmanoeuvre it.
- Hold her steady.

270
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,703
- Aye aye, sir.
- Keep a sharp lookout astern!

271
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,390
<i>Lost radar contact at 6-5-0-0 yards, sir.</i>

272
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,229
Very well. Secure from battle stations.

273
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,306
Secure from battle stations.

274
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,898
Second section, take the watch.

275
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,346
I'll take the conn. Lay below.

276
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,426
Aye aye, sir.

277
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,625
Well, you've had the boat for a week now.

278
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,548
I guess you noticed
how quickly she responds.

279
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,982
Always a shudder when you push her
too hard. Best to ease her into it.

280
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,068
- Thanks. Anything else?
- Just one thing, sir.

281
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,819
She hates showing her backsides
to Japanese submarines.

282
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,146
Permission to go below, sir?

283
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,226
Granted.

284
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,188
Now hear this, now hear this.
Orders of the day.

285
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,462
To your sacks, men. You've got
25 seconds to lay flat on your backs.

286
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,058
Any of you gripers want a sleeping pill?

287
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,750
He's a caution. Isn't he a caution!

288
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,020
Give the skipper a couple, will ya?

289
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,063
A Jap sub and all these drills.
The Captain must be running scared.

290
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,341
It's the craziest war patrol
I ever started on.

291
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,429
Who said anything about a war patrol?
You're all confused, my friend.

292
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,702
We're on a drill patrol. First time
in the annals of the Navy Department.

293
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,266
What's it all mean?
What's he got in mind, huh?

294
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,826
Haven't you heard? He's gonna
challenge the Japs to a drill.

295
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,181
The winner will get
an all-expense-paid honeymoon

296
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,778
with Tokyo Rose in the Bungo Straits.

297
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,222
Gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate.
Let us pay tribute to that great motto.

298
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,342
"Caution with safety
and safety with caution."

299
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,426
Now. Let's do better than that.

300
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,986
Let's drink a toast to
our beloved captain, the drillmaster!

301
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,102
For he knew our fleet boat
was faster than a Jap sub.

302
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,982
I've had enough kidding, Jerry.

303
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,578
Why? A cautious captain
with orders to "avoid"?

304
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,508
If we stay out of Area 7
as well as the Straits, we're in.

305
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,066
- I bet he's thinking of a way now!
- Excuse me, sir. Your watch list.

306
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,863
What about that, Mueller?
You're chummy with him.

307
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,539
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mr Cartwright. Do you, sir?

308
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,468
Come back here, Kraut!

309
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,581
Get out, Mueller. Go on.

310
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,184
If you have any questions, you come
to me, not the crew. Understand?

311
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,268
And that goes for your opinions, too.

312
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,580
Maybe we'd better break this up.
It's getting late.

313
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,986
Shut up.

314
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,509
<i>Battle stations manned.</i>
<i>Standing by for drill.</i>

315
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,186
Lookouts, below!

316
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,026
Clear the bridge!

317
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,946
Dive! Dive!

318
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,386
Surface! Surface!

319
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,066
- Someone up topside, sir!
- All stop!

320
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,499
- All stop, sir.
- Emergency! Surface!

321
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,186
Open up!

322
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,307
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right, sir. I'm OK.

323
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,228
Who gave you permission
to dump the garbage?

324
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,228
- Mr Cartwright, sir.
- I thought he'd asked the OD.

325
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,659
- I was on the bridge. I...
- Get below.

326
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,348
Yes, sir.

327
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,187
Only the captain gives permission
to dump the trash.

328
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,939
Instead of losing time on this drill,
we almost lose a man!

329
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,306
Stand by to dive!

330
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,227
- Check the watch, Mr Kohler.
- Aye aye, sir.

331
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,266
Mr Bledsoe.

332
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,548
Yes, sir?

333
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,980
- Have you been with this boat long?
- Over a year, sir.

334
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,941
And is this the kind of cooperation
you usually get?

335
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,988
No, sir.

336
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,180
A man could've been killed today.

337
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,189
The responsibility is yours.
You're in charge of the drills.

338
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,189
I have no excuses. But under the
circumstances, the crew did their best.

339
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,266
- What circumstances?
- Don't press it.

340
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,539
I want an answer.

341
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,821
It's one thing to drill a crew.
But when you duck a Jap sub,

342
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,023
they wonder why they should care when
the Captain has no stomach for attacking.

343
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,505
Does he want obedience, efficiency,

344
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,019
or the best-drilled cowards in the Navy?

345
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,342
Mr Bledsoe, tell them I'm doubling
the drills, starting tomorrow.

346
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,028
Yes, sir.

347
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,710
You might as well know, sir.
I don't believe it.

348
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,183
Believe what?

349
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,268
That you ran away from that sub
from cowardice.

350
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,023
I know what ya mean, but what's the cook
supposed to do - eat the garbage?

351
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,108
- We haven't had a minute...
- Hey, Vince.

352
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,986
SJ contact, SJ contact!

353
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,068
Bearing 3-3-0, range 15 miles.

354
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,942
- A big one, huh?
- It's not a fishing boat, friend.

355
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,624
Picking up two of them now, sir.

356
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,865
Range closing.
Enemy on southerly course.

357
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,548
Very well.

358
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,106
Right full rudder,
come right to course 3-3-0.

359
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,983
Right full rudder, sir,
coming right to 3-3-0.

360
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,829
<i>- Very well.</i>
- Looks like he's going to go in.

361
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,259
Sightseeing, Pat. Just sightseeing.

362
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,146
I can see them now.

363
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,304
Lead ship, possible Momo destroyer.
Trailing ship, a large tanker.

364
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,629
We'll wait until the destroyer passes,
then take on the tanker.

365
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,945
<i>Shifting to TBT. Bearing coming down.</i>

366
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,350
Bearing 0-2-0.

367
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,028
Set, sir.

368
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,267
Right full rudder,
come right to course 0-3-0.

369
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,346
<i>Open outer doors on tubes 1 and 2.</i>

370
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,667
- Open outer doors on tubes 1 and 2.
- Open outer doors on 1 and 2.

371
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,259
Angle on the bow now. Starboard 70.

372
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,699
Torpedo spread - one right, one left.

373
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,742
Solution checking. Everything's set, sir.

374
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,861
Destroyer's well clear now.
Tanker range 3-2-0-0.

375
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,539
- <i>All ready to fire, sir.</i>
- Very well. Stand by, tube 1.

376
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,228
Stand by, tube 1.

377
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,584
- What's the torpedo run?
- 2500 yards, sir.

378
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,223
- Commence firing.
- Fire 1.

379
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,944
Fire 1.

380
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,226
- 1 fired, sir.
- Stand by, 2.

381
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,545
- Spread set.
- Fire 2.

382
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,626
Fire 2.

383
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,982
- 2 fired.
- No.1 running hot and straight, sir.

384
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,462
Destroyer's angle on the bow
now zero. Bearing?

385
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,863
- Bearing 0-4-5.
- He's heading right at us.

386
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,550
Keep the sound down.
We'll have orders to go deep.

387
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,944
Aye aye, sir.

388
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,627
If you've had any questions about
the drills, you'll have 'em answered now.

389
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,389
<i>We're taking on the Momo.</i>

390
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,947
<i>Right standard rudder,</i>
<i>come right to course 0-4-5.</i>

391

Closing in fast. Coming head on.

396
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,902
At range 1-5-0-0, we'll crash-dive.
At 50 feet, we'll give her two fish.

397
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,590
Down the throat? It's a bow shot.

398
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,748
Range 1,800.

399
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,546
Lookouts, below!

Stand by to dive.

401
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,826
- Stand by to dive.
<i>- Clear the bridge!</i>

402
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,946
<i>Dive! Dive!</i>

412
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,620
Fire 4.

413
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,469
- 4 fired, sir.
- Stand by to take her down fast.

414
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,378
- Stand by to take her down fast!
- Aye aye, sir. Standing by.

415
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,179
- Captain, we got 'em!
- In 32 seconds!

416
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,107
32 seconds!

417
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,739
Left full rudder, all ahead one third.

418
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,030
Very well. Now hear this.
Captain speaking.

419
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,109
You just gave a Jap tin can the deep six
with a bow shot in 32 seconds.

420
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,381
This boat is ready for anything.
Let's keep it that way.

421
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,626
Drills - no more than usual tomorrow.

422
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,503
Mr Bledsoe, take the conn
and get us back on course.

423
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,586
Aye aye, sir.

424
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,270
- Boy, that skipper!
- He knocks 'im down!

425
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,346
Observation.

426
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,470
Hey, come here, you guys. Listen to this.

427
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,142
"Dear Commander,
Japanese Imperial Fleet,

428
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,501
be it hereby known that on July 31st 1943,

429
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,225
the USS Nerka, under the command
of Captain PJ Richardson,

430
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,227
sunk a Japanese destroyer."

431
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,186
"One down, 20 fish to go."
Signed, Kraut Mueller.

432
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,586
How about that? We've been
drilling for a bow shot all the time.

433
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,259
- Hey, Ruby, you were up there.
- Right on the pickle, dear friend.

434
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,348
That tin can zigs right into us.
I tell ya, I was shaking!

435
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,019
- What did the old man do?
- Calm, you know. No excitement.

436
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,302
Orders two fish right down the throat.
Just like you'd order ham and eggs.

437
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,264
If we'd missed, we wouldn't have lived
long enough to get into Area 7.

438
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,349
- We won't live long enough to get out.
- Lf, if, if! Go back to Sears Roebuck!

439
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,381
<i>Forgive me if I interrupt the music.</i>

440
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,263
<i>You are listening to the voice</i>
<i>you call Tokyo Rose,</i>

441
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,746
<i>speaking to you from the heart</i>
<i>of the Japanese empire,</i>

442
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,419
<i>telling you in your own language</i>
<i>of a war you cannot win.</i>

443
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,260
<i>It has been substantiated that we have</i>
<i>destroyed 16 enemy ships this month.</i>

444
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,463
Oh, come on, Rosie, get up to date!
You're missing one Jap tin can!

445
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,750
Jessie! Jessie, dear friend!

446
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,861
We've decided to be big about it.

447
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,300
We're not gonna hold you responsible
for Area 7 any longer.

448
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,580
- We'll take back the money.
- Gosh!

449
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,940
Well, that's nice of you fellas,

450
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,699
but my conscience hurt me so much,
I threw it overboard.

451
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,300
- Not now, Kohler.
- Don't shut me up again, Lieutenant.

452
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,987
I've seen all kinds of captains.
We've seen 'em together.

453
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,385
But I never saw one
run away from a Jap sub,

454
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,059
then take on a destroyer with a shot
I didn't even know was in the book.

455
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,146
There has to be a reason.

456
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,866
That bow shot didn't just happen.

457
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,743
The drills were planned for it.
The whole thing was...

458
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,426
I never heard of a bow shot
being set up except in desperation.

459
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,506
It's all like some experiment.

460
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,259
Suppose a bow shot was the only way
he thought he could get an Akikaze.

461
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,143
An Akikaze isn't a Momo.
There's a helluva difference.

462
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,579
This Akikaze's in the Bungo Straits.

463
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,861
But that's impossible.
The orders say to avoid it.

464
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,906
I know.

465
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,979
Look, I know how you feel about him
taking the boat and all.

466
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,864
But don't you think
you're working at it overtime, sir?

467
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,629
We'll be hitting Area 7 tomorrow morning.

468
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,506
Four,

469
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,063
five,

470
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,462
six.

471
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,580
It's a convoy all right, sir.
Bearing 3-2-0 relative.

472
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,940
Sounds like a whole lot of 'em, sir.

473
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,346
- Cullen.
- Aye aye, sir.

474
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,426
I have the dive. Depth: 60 feet.

475
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,020
- Forward torpedo room ready, sir.
- We're undetected, sir.

476
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,106
Aft torpedo room manned and ready.

477
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,586
We're dead ahead of the convoy.
What firing position shall we take?

478
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,582
Captain?

479
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,586
Take her down, sir?

480
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,906
Take her down to 100 feet.

481
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,986
100 feet. Aye aye, sir.

482
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,149
Five degrees down bubble.
Take her to 100 feet.

483
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,023
Secure from battle stations
when we level off.

484
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,506
- Come right to course 2-8-0.
- Right to course 2-8-0, sir.

485
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,144
Very well. Mr Cartwright,
take over the conn.

486
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,419
Yes, sir.

487
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,660
What's he doing? What's going on?

488
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,259
- Give me a line on course 2-8-0.
- Sir?

489
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,143
- A line on course 2-8-0 now!
- Aye aye, sir.

490
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,068
- What's the skipper up...
- Later, Beckman.

491
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,819
- Start levelling off.
- Aye aye, sir.

492
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,938
There it is. You might as well post it.

493
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,382
A whole area to patrol and you pick
the graveyard - the Bungo Straits!

494
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,829
It's the only place we can get the Akikaze.

495
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,906
The one spot you're ordered to avoid.

496
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,942
You make it sound like
a snap decision. It wasn't.

497
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,109
That's quite obvious. Passing
a Jap submarine to save your torpedoes.

498
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,779
Risking a bow shot. Ducking a convoy
so they can't radio our position.

499
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,300
You planned it, all right! You knew it
the day I came to your house!

500
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,184
I knew it before that, Jim. I knew it
a year ago when my boat went down.

501
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,622
We have explicit orders. We have a crew
that expects the captain to follow them.

502
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,105
You know that a captain
can redefine orders

503
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,186
if he feels he has an advantage.

504
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,540
- What advantage?
- You named it. A bow shot.

505
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,900
We did it with a Momo.
We can do it again.

506
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,069
You call that an advantage when
four subs before us never had a chance?

507
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,068
They were detected.
Not even Pearl knows where we are.

508
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,146
What about the Japanese navy?

509
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,262
No, sir, that's no advantage.
Not in <i>my</i> book.

510
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,346
But you're not the captain.

511
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,830
If you should fail
but come out of this alive,

512
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,987
there won't be a desk
small enough for you this time!

513
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,785
That's strange, Jim.
I never even thought of failing.

514
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,778
You've got a lot of guts, sir,
with other people's lives.

515
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,060
That's my decision and my responsibility!

516
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,181
To whom? To a crew
that died a year ago?

517
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,870
Yes! To a dead crew, a dead sub!

518
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,306
Believe what you want.

519
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,546
Well, this crew's still alive.

520
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,868
They have a right to know where
they're going. Do I have to tell them?

521
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,744
What's the matter? Surely
you've got guts enough for this, too.

522
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,306
This is the Captain.

523
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,990
Due to conditions of special advantage,

524
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,500
I have decided to take this boat
to the Bungo Straits.

525
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,181
Bungo Straits, broad on the port beam.

526
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,026
We're there.

527
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,026
Bungo Straits.

528
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,746
We're at the Straits.

529
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,666
Bungo Straits.

530
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,185
We're there. We're in the Straits.

531
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,780
If I'd only been born on the 8th.

532
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,346
See you a moment, sir?

533
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,706
- What is this?
- We... We want to talk to you, Jim.

534
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,902
- I looked through the Navy rules.
- We want you to take over.

535
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,225
That's very flattering, gentlemen.

536
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,102
Let's go. Everyone outside.

537
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,266
- They're Navy orders!
- What right...

538
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,585
A captain's right. That's all he needs.

539
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,666
We might as well
make up our minds now.

540
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,509
- We'll follow his orders.
- Where? To the bottom?

541
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,383
If that's what he's got in mind,
that's where we'll go.

542
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,865
This boat - any boat - has one captain.

543
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,746
Is that right, Kohler?

544
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,262
Yes, sir.

545
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,746
- Is that right, Mr Cartwright?
- Yes, sir.

546
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,826
Let's break this up.

547
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,746
Mr Cartwright, with all due respect
to your rank,

548
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,430
may I say that I think you're an ass?

549
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,459
I see by this report that
you called Mr Cartwright an ass.

550
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,546
- Yes, sir.
- An officer?

551
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,422
That's right, sir.

552
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,747
- Mueller, you're a damn fool.
- Yes, sir, I know.

553
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,021
But as long as I overheard,
you might as well know, too.

554
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,948
They wanted Mr Bledsoe to take over.

555
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,630
- He put an end to that fast.
- He would.

556
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,345
- Would you tell me something?
- If I can, sir.

557
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,462
- Am I a damn fool, too?
- Sir?

558
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:50,061
Mr Bledsoe seems to think I am,
and I have a great respect for his opinion.

559
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,341
Maybe you have to be, Captain,
to do something like this.

560
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,019
You nailed that Momo with a bow shot.
Why not the Akikaze?

561
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,347
The Akikaze never misses, Mueller. Never.

562
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,825
Well, he will this time, sir.

563
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,659
Is that a classified opinion
or am I at liberty to repeat it?

564
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,746
It's a fact, sir.

565
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,101
A fact they'll all realise
at Bungo Pete's funeral!

566
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:06,463
<i>Convoy now bearing 3-1-3.</i>
<i>Range 7,000 yards.</i>

567
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,309
Are we gonna set up
on the leading ship, sir?

568
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,389
That's a decoy. Shallow craft.
Used to draw fire away from the convoy.

569
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,066
You could shoot ten fish.
They'd only run under it.

570
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,668
There! There she is,
pulling up to the convoy!

571
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,542
- The Akikaze.
- Yes.

572
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,423
She'll keep astern of both columns
until they zig.

573
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,462
Look at her cut through there!
Must be making 30 knots!

574
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,502
Doesn't stay in position long enough
to give you a target.

575
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,586
Not unless he's coming toward you.

576
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,988
Take over in the conning tower. Track
the next-to-last ship in the port column.

577
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,022
We'll give you a bearing.
Right standard rudder!

578
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,106
Very well.

579
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,341
This is the Captain. The convoy we've
been waiting for is on our starboard bow.

580
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,782
<i>The plan of attack is as follows.</i>
<i>First, we'll strike a freighter going in.</i>

581
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,663
<i>If that doesn't bring</i>
<i>the Akikaze toward us,</i>

582
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,429
<i>we'll attack the freighter nearest him.</i>

583
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,338
<i>When the Akikaze does head toward us,</i>
<i>we'll dive and give him two fish</i>

584
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,700
<i>at 1500 yards, just like the Momo.</i>

585
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,786
Let's go. All ahead standard.

586
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,787
- All ahead standard, sir.
- Very well.

587
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,149
How's the target course
and speed check with the TDC?

588
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,738
Course checks. Speed, one knot slower.

589
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:42,144
Plane contact, sir.

590
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,228
Captain, radar's picked up enemy planes.

591
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:51,308
Lookouts, planes coming in.
Watch for them.

592
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,148
Aye aye, sir.

593
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:57,786
- 15 miles. Range closing.
- Planes 15 miles. Range closing.

594
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,506
They're closing fast, sir.

595
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,701
- Planes closing fast, sir.
- The Japs must've known we were here.

596
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,786
We're going in according to plan.

597
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,219
<i>Give me the setup.</i>

598
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,500
- Stay on that freighter.
- Aye aye, sir.

599
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,305
<i>Range on freighter 2,000, sir.</i>
<i>Track 70, gyro 20 right.</i>

600
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,662
<i>- Recommend firing course 2-9-7.</i>
- Come right to 2-9-7.

601
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,544
- Right to course 2-9-7, sir.
- Planes six miles.

602
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,260
- They'll be on us in a minute.
- Stand by.

603
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,939
Ready on tubes 1 and 2.
Outer doors open. Standing by.

604
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,303
Range 1800 yards.

605
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,540
- Commence firing.
- Fire 1.

606
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,547
Fire 1.

607
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,661
- 1 has been fired.
- 1 fired, sir.

608
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,588
- 1's away. Fire 2.
- Fire 2.

609
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,700
- 2 has been fired.
- 2 is fired, sir.

610
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,549
- 2's away.
- Make ready stern tubes!

611
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,230
Make ready stern tubes.

612
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,468
- Aircraft now one mile.
- Come to course 0-8-9.

613
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,501
Coming to course 0-8-9!

614
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,224
Very well. Time check on first torpedo.

615
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,580
Five seconds, four...

616
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,500
Both fish hit. She's headed down.

617
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,382
Stern tubes ready, sir.

618
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,423
Aircraft range steady.
Appear to be circling overhead.

619
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,420
Right full rudder, all ahead flank.

620
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,749
Shift target to Akikaze.
He's coming on. Bearing coming down.

621
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,346
- Bearing 2-5-0.
- 2-5-0, sir.

622
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,544
Radar to bridge. Aircraft returning.

623
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,307
Range 4,000. Tubes 3 and 4 ready.
Outer doors open.

624
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:48,022
- Want me to take her down, sir?
- Not yet, not yet! Lookouts, below!

625
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,668
Range 3,000.

626
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,985
We'll have to fire from surface. Stand by.

627
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,266
- Commence firing!
- Fire 3.

628
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,706
- 3 fired, sir.
- 3's away, sir.

629
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,146
Clear the bridge!

630
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,059
Dive! Dive!

631
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,539
- Take her down to 300 fast!
- Aye aye, sir!

632
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,146
- Gimme a time check on that fish.
- 24, 23...

633
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,501
Torpedo screws, sir.
Heading toward our port side.

634
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,350
- Must be that last torpedo, sir.
- It's a runaway.

635
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:56,224
Coming back at us! Crash-dive!
Sound collision alarm!

636
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,101
Passing 7-5 feet, sir.

637
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,348
Passing 9-0 feet, sir.

638
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,550
Destroyer coming in, sir.

639
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,588
He's shifting to attack frequency, sir!

640
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,507
Picking up splashes, sir.
Depth charges on the way down.

641
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,062
Passing 150 feet.

642
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,901
It's all right! Leave it!
The governor'll stop it at 2100rpm.

643
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,747
<i>Forward torpedo room reporting.</i>
<i>Hatch was blown on the main...</i>

644
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,826
<i>We cannot make...</i>

645
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,906
Forward torpedo room.

646
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,426
Forward torpedo room.

647
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,701
- Phone circuit's out, sir.
- Check on the damage.

648
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:42,149
- Captain wants a damage report.
- A couple of dogs sheared off the hatch.

649
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,340
- Can you fix it?
- I'll know in a minute.

650
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,186
Turn on emergency lights.

651
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,508
Torpedo room.
Forward torpedo room, report.

652
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,986
Forward torpedo room.

653
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,670
Take the conn. I'm going to check.

654
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,941
<i>- Levelling off.</i>
- All ahead one third!

655
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,021
- Is the hatch sprung?
- A couple of dogs sheared off.

656
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,939
Close the hatch! Close the hatch!

657
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,746
Close the hatch!

658
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,820
<i>Losing depth control.</i>
<i>Heavy forward. Request more speed.</i>

659
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,306
Forward room must be flooding.
All ahead standard!

660
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,546
- You OK, sir?
- Yeah.

661
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:40,026
- Is the compartment flooded?
- Partially.

662
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,106
Three dead.

663
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,024
They're coming in for the kill, sir.

664
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,500
Only way to get out of this alive
is to make 'em think we're all dead.

665
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:02,384
- Send up an oil slick?
- Send up blankets, gear, everything.

666
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,063
Jim,

667
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:10,027
the men that were killed,
send <i>them</i> up through the tubes.

668
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,308
Yes, sir.

669
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:20,346
Screws diminishing, sir!

670
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:41,500
Captain? Captain, there's
something else here. Listen.

671
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,825
What is it, sir? I can't make that out.

672
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,346
What's the situation in the hatch?

673
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:25,419
It's OK. The engineer should have
the new parts ready in a couple of hours.

674
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,428
It's well secured
with block and tackle, sir.

675
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,906
Clear the compartment.

676
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:36,989
OK, everybody out. Come on.
On the double. Let's go, fellas.

677
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,149
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

678
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,823
Here. Better take a swallow, sir.

679
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:11,539
- What is it?
- A stimulant from the medical safe.

680
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,025
It's 100 proof, sir.

681
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:19,059
- How long have I been out?
- Just a few minutes, Captain.

682
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,744
You'd better worry about yourself.
You'll be in for a rough time.

683
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,226
Hendrix knows his stuff.
You've had a pretty bad concussion.

684
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,228
It's worse than that.
There's a medical term for it,

685
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:38,423
but it all adds up to blacking out
now and then for quite a while.

686
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,180
If you don't keep off your feet, sir,
you'll be blacking out permanently!

687
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:49,266
- You'll keep this to yourselves.
- But, sir...

688
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,346
That's an order, Hendrix.

689
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,306
Send for Mr Bledsoe.

690
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,264
- Well, go on!
- Yes, sir.

691
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,899
The torpedo firing circuits
will take 24 hours to repair.

692
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,624
We'll have to set up
a jury-rig for the radio,

693
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,059
and the radar needs some work, too.

694
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,146
That's another 24 hours.

695
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:44,503
Not bad, considering. We'll lay over
for two days, then we can get moving.

696
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:49,579
Yeah, the timing's perfect.
Those convoys come out every 48 hours.

697
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,541
- You really got shook up, didn't you?
- No.

698
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:58,743
- No, I couldn't feel better.
- Then maybe I didn't hear you right.

699
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,021
You heard me right.
I'm talking about the Straits.

700
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,584
Going back to the Bungo Straits.

701
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,108
We're through playing with lives.
It's the end of the line.

702
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,300
Why? Because a torpedo went wild?

703
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,785
You know that's 100 to 1, an accident.

704
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:21,506
The whole Japanese air force...
dropping everything it's got.

705
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,623
- That's an accident, too?
- Next time around, we'll make it.

706
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,944
What are you gonna do? Swim back
to the Straits or use a lifeboat?

707
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,948
Because that's all the help
you're gonna get.

708
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:38,748
Those are tall words.
You'd better stop and think a minute.

709
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:43,022
I have thought about it. That wasn't
a tea party the crew held before.

710
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:46,745
They wanted me to take over then.
They'll feel the same way now.

711
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:51,182
You make one move to take over and,
I swear, I'll see that you're hung!

712
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:55,462
Then we'll hang together. Orders
were disobeyed. No more technicalities.

713
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:59,344
A fleet boat of the Navy,
a sub with her fighting power intact,

714
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,426
and you'd take her back to Pearl?

715
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:03,188
I don't believe it!

716
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,866
Mr Cartwright!

717
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,346
Yes, sir?

718
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,224
We'll lay over two days for repairs
before returning to Pearl.

719
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,102
I'll be in command.

720
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,380
Get a detail started right away.

721
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,707
- Yes, sir.
- That's all, Cartwright.

722
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,106
Yes, sir.

723
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:39,749
The best Exec I could get
in the whole Navy!

724
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,826
The backstop, I think you said!

725
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:46,023
And the first command you give
as a captain is to order a retreat!

726
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,749
Goodbye, Bungo! Hello, Pearl!

727
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:15,828
- Funny, funny, funny!
- What's with you?

728
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,020
We're trying to eat. Knock it off.

729
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,460
- Is this a private dining room?
- Wanna sing? Go to the head!

730
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,058
It'll take more than <i>you</i> to put me there!

731
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,988
Break it up!
What's the matter with you guys?

732
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:29,419
We're going back to Pearl, aren't we?

733
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,101
How many patrols have you had,
Mr Sears Roebuck?

734
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:38,586
- This is my second.
- Well, I've had five since '42.

735
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,861
I've taken depth charges, shells, strafings,

736
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,743
even a bombing run off the Solomons.

737
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:49,148
This is the first time I've gone back
to Pearl with 15 torpedoes still aboard.

738
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,910
Kohler, better start the torpedo check.

739
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,021
- Aye aye, sir.
- Mr Cartwright?

740
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,710
- Do you think we could've had 'im?
- What?

741
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,390
Suppose that fish hadn't gone wild, sir.

742
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:04,742
You think that aircraft was playing
games? The Japs had us detected.

743
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,338
- The Captain said...
- He's flat on his back.

744
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,859
Be better if somebody
had put him there sooner.

745
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,504
- Kohler, get started.
- Mr Cartwright...

746
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,985
This time words just fail me!

747
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,710
- It's this way, sir. I...
- Why didn't you stop it?

748
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,583
- I didn't know it was gonna happen.
- You let it go on.

749
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,826
- No, sir...
- Then it didn't happen?

750
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,510
If I have to put every crew member
on report, I will!

751
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,586
It was my fault, sir.

752
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,101
Go on up to the bridge.
Tell the OD you're on report.

753
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,946
- Sir...
- What did you say?

754
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:44,585
I told you once
to keep your opinions to yourself!

755
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,666
Now get out of here!

756
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,746
Yes, sir.

757
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:55,786
I'm not going to stand for
any fighting or insubordination.

758
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:59,903
If you think you've got a soft touch,
you're mistaken! You hear?

759
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:06,939
Wow! How about that?
Chewing out an officer in front of us!

760
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:11,029
He was chewing us all out.
What's he so sore at us for?

761
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,588
- Turn it up a bit.
- It's OK. Let's leave it.

762
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,509
What are you trying
to do - break the plate?

763
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:31,309
<i>You are listening once again</i>
<i>to the voice you call Tokyo Rose.</i>

764
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,386
- Turn it off.
- Yes, sir.

765
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:37,662
<i>I play the music for the wives and</i>
<i>sweethearts of the submarine Nerka.</i>

766
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:41,578
<i>You'll never see these men again.</i>
<i>The Nerka has been sunk.</i>

767
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,589
<i>- It's at the bottom of the Bungo Straits.</i>
- They bought it. They chalked us up.

768
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:49,669
<i>We send our regrets to the relatives</i>
<i>of Captain PJ Richardson,</i>

769
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,180
<i>of officers James Bledsoe,</i>
<i>Gerald Cartwright,</i>

770
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:55,107
<i>Carl Beckman.</i>

771
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,949
<i>Of seamen Jessie Warner, Kraut Mueller...</i>

772
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,140
- Kraut Mueller? How...
- Listen!

773
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:03,068
<i>You'll never see them again.</i>
<i>Think about it.</i>

774
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:05,943
<i>Think what your country</i>
<i>has done to these men</i>

775
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,026
<i>as you listen to the music.</i>

776
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:10,539
They even named us!
The officers, the crew!

777
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,626
How could they possibly know?

778
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,382
- Welsh?
- Yes, sir?

779
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,263
Were any messages sent
after we entered Area 7?

780
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:27,348
No, sir. We cut off all transmission.
Captain's orders.

781
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,542
No information, no transmitting
of any kind left this boat?

782
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,626
That's right, sir.

783
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,903
Yes, sir?

784
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:45,590
Did you ever sign your name
"Kraut" Mueller?

785
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:49,066
Only on that notice I put up
about the Momo destroyer.

786
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,100
- Where's Russo?
- Yes, sir?

787
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,983
The trash you put in the sacks -
how do you weight it?

788
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:02,546
- How do you weight it? Answer me!
- Tin cans, broken tools.

789
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,901
- Anything I can find to weight it down.
- Does it sink?

790
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,986
- I think so, sir.
- You <i>think</i> so?

791
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:10,465
I can't say for certain, Mr Bledsoe.

792
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:12,740
Did you dump any sacks off the Straits?

793
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:14,826
Yes, sir.

794
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,346
What have I done now?

795
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,946
How do you feel?

796
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:28,822
I'm all right.

797
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,942
Repairs are completed.
We're ready to move.

798
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,026
The crew must be very happy.

799
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:40,068
Aren't you?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

800
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,066
That's what I wanted.

801
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:48,226
I see.

802
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:52,461
- You're going back to the Straits.
- That's right.

803
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,546
What changed your mind?

804
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,661
I found out how they detected us.

805
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:00,339
Those fishing barges along the coast
have been picking up our garbage.

806
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:03,621
For the first time,
we have a real advantage.

807
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,502
Sure, Jim.

808
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,586
I made the same speech.

809
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:11,988
But you and I both know that
the odds are still against us.

810
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:15,864
There's always a calculated risk,
the unknown factor.

811
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,826
Let's not kid ourselves.

812
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,022
You're going back
because you've been through it,

813
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,106
because you <i>have</i> to go back.

814
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,666
You knew all along I would.

815
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:32,625
Let's say I had a hunch your order
to retreat wouldn't be carried out.

816
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,986
OK, Rich.

817
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:42,101
I guess the real reason I came in here
was to tell you that I...

818
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,027
Good luck, Jim.

819
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:27,062
We know they think we're sunk. There's
no way for them to know we're here.

820
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:30,341
Every angle has been covered
except the risk of battle.

821
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,620
We're gonna make that risk pay off.

822
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,386
Any more questions?

823
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,219
There must be something you wanna ask.

824
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,500
Well, sir, we all thought...

825
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,862
Would you mind
stepping over here a moment, sir?

826
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,826
Be my guest, Mr Bledsoe.

827
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:04,910
Thanks, Kohler. It's a privilege.

828
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,626
Decoy leading as before.

829
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,386
There she is - the Akikaze.

830
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:32,070
Travelling about 30 knots and coming up.

831
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,823
Stand by to surface.

832
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,943
Surface.

833
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:51,389
<i>What is it, sir?</i>
<i>I can't make that out. What is it, sir?</i>

834
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,826
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

835
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,424
Port side clear, sir.

836
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,506
Steady on course 0-5-0.

837
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,622
- Due course 0-5-0, sir.
- Very well.

838
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:34,026
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

839
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,469
All ahead one third, sir.

840
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:43,946
Very well. Lookouts, to the bridge!

841
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:47,100
Mr Cartwright, same plan of action.

842
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:50,905
We'll attack the last freighter
in the starboard column.

843
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:54,864
When the Akikaze comes in,
we'll give her a bow shot as before.

844
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,981
All tubes ready for firing, sir.

845
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:07,103
In firing position.
Good setup on freighter.

846
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:10,188
- Outer doors open on tubes 1 and 2.
- Fire 1.

847
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:12,062
Fire 1.

848
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,940
- 1 fired, sir.
- 1's away, sir.

849
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,586
Fire 2.

850
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,540
- 2 fired, sir.
- 2's away, sir.

851
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,185
Left 10-degree rudder.
Come to course 0-4-1.

852
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:08,979
Akikaze moving up starboard side
of burning freighter.

853
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,426
Bearing on Akikaze.

854
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,461
- 0-8-9, sir.
- Come right to course 0-8-9.

855
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,865
Coming right to course 0-8-9, sir.

856
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,026
At what range will we fire, sir?

857
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,983
1,500 yards. We'll take her
with decks awash.

858
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,226
Shift to battery. All ahead one-third.

859
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,308
Shifting to battery.
All ahead one third, sir.

860
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,785
- Control room.
<i>- Control room, aye aye.</i>

861
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:35,263
Flood down to 26 feet.

862
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,542
Aye aye, sir. Open main ballast
tank vents. Flood down to 26 feet.

863
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:44,386
- Range to Akikaze?
- Range 2400 yards.

864
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:48,105
- Use tubes 3 and 4 on this run.
<i>- Tubes 3 and 4. Aye aye, sir.</i>

865
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,906
Rig out bow planes.

866
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,306
Range 2,100 yards.

867
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,860
Open outer doors on tubes 3 and 4.

868
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:18,260
Stand by to fire tubes 3 and 4.

869
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,382
Ready on tubes 3 and 4.
Outer doors open.

870
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:25,822
Range 1,800.

871
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,906
Lookouts, below!

872
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,822
Range 1-6-0-0.

873
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:51,066
Commence firing at 1-5-0-0.

874
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,862
Stand by to fire.

875
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,341
Fire 3.

876
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,741
- 3 fired, sir.
- 3's away, sir.

877
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,020
Fire 4.

878
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,425
- 4 fired, sir.
- 4's away, sir.

879
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,029
Clear the bridge!

880
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,386
Dive! Dive!

881
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,900
15-degree angle. Take her deep!

882
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,468
That's it! We got her!

883
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,343
All ahead one third!

884
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,143
Level off and bring her up
to periscope depth!

885
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,659
<i>What is it, sir? I can't make that out.</i>

886
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,106
Take a look.

887
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,585
Sir, listen.

888
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,382
That transmission again.
I can't make that out.

889
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:54,184
Bledsoe! Take her down!
Sound collision! Take her down fast!

890
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:57,586
Sound collision! All ahead full!
Flood negative! Take her down!

891
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,019
Flood negative! Hard dive on planes!

892
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:29,302
- Torpedo coming! Another runaway!
- But both were hits!

893
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:33,059
It's not ours. It's theirs.
It's from another sub.

894
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:36,944
That's what sunk all our boats.
A Japanese submarine.

895
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,386
She missed us.

896
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:57,579
Captain, hadn't you better go below?

897
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,546
Passing 90 feet, sir.

898
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,946
All ahead one third.

899
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,546
Level off at 120.

900
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,426
Rig ship for silent running.

901
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:13,789
Shift to manual control. Shut down
ventilation. Secure all machinery.

902
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,140
No unnecessary movement or talking.

903
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,148
Here he is, sir.

904
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:17,946
I've lost him.

905
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:20,379
They've stopped their motors.

906
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,426
Let's make it a standoff.

907
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:26,986
All stop.

908
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:29,148
All stopped, sir.

909
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:07,505
Can't hold her down
too long without some speed.

910
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,780
We'll have to start the motor soon.

911
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,140
Let's hope they start theirs first.

912
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:55,628
- What was his last true bearing?
- 1-3-5.

913
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:59,143
The bearing's no good
without knowing his depth.

914
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:02,706
And we can't get that.
We gotta get him to surface.

915
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,706
There's a convoy still up there.

916
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:09,379
With the Akikaze gone, he'll have to
come up to protect those ships.

917
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,466
Suppose we sink a couple.

918
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:17,305
- Do I have your permission, sir?
- You're the captain now.

919
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,546
- Stand by to surface!
- Standing by!

920
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:22,184
Secure from sound running and collision!

921
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:24,062
All ahead full!

922
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:35,938
Re-Ioad forward tubes when we surface.

923
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:48,942
Shift targets. Angle on the bow
70 starboard, bearing coming down!

924
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:51,026
Commence firing when set!

925
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:54,301
- Radar, any sign of that sub?
- Not yet, sir.

926
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,422
- Keep a sharp lookout, Johnson!
- Aye aye, sir.

927
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,541
Fire 3.

928
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,548
Fire 4.

929
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:14,308
New radar contact. Bearing 3-0-3 relative.

930
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,186
That should be our friend.

931
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,742
There he is.

932
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,626
He's changing course.

933
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,742
Moving in behind the decoy.
Using it as a screen.

934
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,907
Right standard rudder,
come right to course 0-6-9.

935
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,304
Very well.

936
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,990
That decoy,
you say it has a shallow draught?

937
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:45,705
Yeah, that's right. We could
shoot under it and hit the sub.

938
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:51,465
Open outer doors on tubes 5 and 6.
Set torpedo depth at 16 feet.

939
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:57,466
Steadied on new course, sir!

940
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:03,268
Range 1-5-0-0. Standing by to fire, sir.

941
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,946
He's all yours, Captain.

942
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:19,108
Fire 5.

943
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,428
- 5's away, sir.
- Fire 6.

944
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:21,384
SJ radar contact! Aircraft coming in fast!

945
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,819
- Clear the deck.
- Lookouts, below!

946
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:27,067
Hurry! Clear the decks! Stand by to dive!

947
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,308
Dive! Dive!

948
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:00,788
It's 38 days now
since we left Pearl Harbor.

949
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:04,869
I know how some of us felt then.
I think I know how some of us feel now.

950
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:08,782
But let no one here,
no one aboard this boat,

951
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,140
ever say we didn't have a captain.

952
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:21,462
Unto Almighty God we commend
the soul of our shipmate departed,

953
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:25,583
and we commit his body to the deep
in the sure and certain hope

954
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,270
of the resurrection unto eternal life

955
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:32,622
when the sea shall give up her dead
in the life of the world to come.

956
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:11,746
