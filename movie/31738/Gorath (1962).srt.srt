1
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:23,110
GORATH
(YOSEI GORASU)

2
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,140
Wouldn't you rather go
swimming in the daylight?

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,970
I can see by the moon's light!

4
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,740
Well... alright, count me in!

5
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,520
Here is the latest news.

6
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,890
Here is the latest news.

7
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,070
At 22:00 hours, the rocket ship JX-1...

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,400
... launched from the Mount Fuji
Interstellar Exploration Agency grounds.

9
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,810
Aboard the ship is Professor
Raizo Sonoda, who's just one of...

10
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,140
... thirty members of its crew.

11
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,950
That's your father!

12
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,650
Good luck, father!

13
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,590
I have to get you home...

14
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Huh?

15
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,230
...to Manabe.

16
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,560
To Manabe?

17
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,970
So you can get back to
your wedding plans!

18
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,900
You!

19
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,630
This is Mount Fuji Observatory 6-1.

20
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,030
You will be 23 degrees above the
equator in three minutes.

21
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,640
Begin second stage interstellar speed
procedures within the next 11,000 meters.

22
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,410
We hope the crew has
a successful mission.

23
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,380
Over...

24
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,620
We are at earth departure point.

25
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,060
All engines to full stop.

26
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,320
All engines to full stop.

27
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,750
Ready the telescopes.

28
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,140
We are at the equatorial point.

29
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,710
Just a little further...

30
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,020
This is earth broadcasting unit 1.

31
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,180
Your route is clear for
interplanetary travel.

32
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,820
Your route is clear for
interplanetary travel.

33
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,230
Your travel time will be approximately
9 months, 30 days and 18 hours.

34
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,590
You should see the star
in about 136 days.

35
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,870
Its mass is about 6000
times that of the earth.

36
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,140
We have named the
new star, "Gorath".

37
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,610
It's 6000 times
the earth's mass?!

38
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,510
The present course of the
star brings it within...

39
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,410
... an extremely close
proximity to our planet.

40
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:32,520
Space control urges you to remain diligent.
If we are to avoid this stellar catastrophe...

41
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,990
... it will only be through the
absolute cooperation of your team.

42
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,760
What will we do? We'll be the
first ship to get there.

43
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,680
Ready main engine for firing!

44
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,940
Ready main engine for firing!

45
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,810
Alter course to
port by 30 minutes.

46
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,250
Altering course to
port by 30 minutes!

47
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,850
Fire!

48
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,490
We have altered
course for the star.

49
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,800
Main engines... fire!

50
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,270
Hey, aren't we going
to explore Saturn?

51
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,500
Attention...

52
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,340
We have just received orders to
proceed to the new star, Gorath. Over.

53
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,880
Captain...

54
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,620
...doesn't that mean we'll be the
first team to explore Gorath?

55
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,430
We'll explore Gorath
for all mankind!

56
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,220
We'll be just like Columbus!

57
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,000
Now passing Comet Carina.

58
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,940
Captain, we don't have
the calculations.

59
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,350
What?!

60
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,080
Oh no, do you think
we've passed it?

61
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,620
You can't be serious!
It's 6000 times the earth's mass!

62
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,090
How could you miss that?

63
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,690
Navigation, check our course
to Gorath once again...

64
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,000
...since we left our station on earth.

65
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,730
We are on the correct
course to Gorath.

66
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,640
Captain, we have an unidentified
object on our monitors!

67
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,640
Where?

68
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,540
Position, 176 degrees spatial,
azimuth at -13 degrees!

69
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,820
Velocity is presently 471!

70
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,560
All engines stop!
Maneuvering rockets ready!

71
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,780
All engines stop!

72
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,990
Maneuvering rockets ready!

73
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,470
Maneuvering rockets, fire!

74
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,040
Maneuvering rockets, fire!

75
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,220
Captain!

76
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,850
That's it...

77
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,380
Maneuvering engines stop.
Turn us 180 degrees.

78
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,300
Rotating ship 180 degrees!

79
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,150
Main engines, fire!

80
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,740
Main engines, fire!

81
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,560
Captain, you're going
to catch it, huh?

82
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,330
We're just keeping pace with it.

83
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,540
Velocity, accelerating to 601!

84
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,880
Booster rockets, fire!

85
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,420
Booster rockets, fire!

86
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,890
Captain, we shouldn't slow down!

87
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,100
It's not scheduled to reach us yet!

88
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,200
Its gravitational pull is
6000 times that of earth's!

89
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,730
Just a moment. Does this
Gorath have a small radius?

90
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,940
How many calculations
did you do?

91
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,470
It's supposed to be 6000
times the earth's mass!

92
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,380
If you have a complaint,
tell them what you found.

93
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,340
Manabe!

94
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,240
Yes, sir!

95
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,390
Gorath is still
increasing in velocity!

96
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,460
Captain...

97
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,030
Is there any chance of
us getting away?

98
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,900
How can we avoid being killed?

99
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,770
It's just that we...

100
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,270
Be quiet!

101
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,440
What made you think
we wouldn't get away?

102
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,280
Don't you think I'd tell
you if we were going to die?

103
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,320
We received a report from
the earth observatory.

104
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,520
Even now, the sun is having an
adverse effect on this star...

105
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,920
...and we don't know
how to stop it.

106
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,800
If the observatory is right...

107
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,600
...we must verify the report.

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,420
United Nation's space station,
is in position above the earth.

109
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,590
This is Japan observatory
reporting for JX-1.

110
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,870
They are in position for Gorath.

111
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,150
Velocity, registering at 591!

112
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,990
Captain!

113
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,830
Crew, listen to our situation.

114
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,670
Our ship has reached the
end of its assignment.

115
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,850
There is no way that we can escape
from this mysterious star, Gorath.

116
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,880
But the data that we collect...

117
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,610
...may help all mankind
on earth to avert this disaster.

118
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,460
Everyone, please continue
to do your best.

119
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,430
Thank you...

120
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,380
Hurrah!

121
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,440
Hurrah!

122
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,710
Hurrah!!

123
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,240
Can you let us pass?

124
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,800
I seriously mean it!

125
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,310
Oh, it's Kanai.

126
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,270
I think you're behaving
disgracefully!

127
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,880
They're developing this
for space in the 1980's.

128
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,750
What do you think? It's being developed for the
Saturn project. It'll grab everyone's attention.

129
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,450
Is that a spaceman's suit?

130
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,690
It's a little something I made
for the year-end vacation.

131
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,490
Did you get the salary
of a space pilot?

132
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,430
I'm happy with anything I
get from those guys!

133
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,900
Trouble's coming...
Bye, bye!

134
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,740
Who the hell is that?

135
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't know.

136
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,410
That Kanai is some character!

137
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,210
He's been that way since
back in high school.

138
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,580
But was he accepted to
be a space pilot?

139
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,720
This year, 800 people
applied for admission.

140
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,050
He began to have difficulties
with artificial satellites...

141
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,590
...but he never gave up trying.

142
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,530
Like a warrior of the Tokugawa era, he
has a strong heart that helps him to win.

143
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,680
You're his daughter, right?

144
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,720
What's going on?

145
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,980
You mean you don't know?!
- Miss! Miss!

146
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,230
Please, cheer up.

147
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,730
Father did what he had to do.

148
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,670
The cabinet has declared,
that the upcoming holidays...

149
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:55,110
... will be used as a period of
mourning for the astronauts.

150
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,580
I am absolutely opposed to it!

151
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,450
So am I...
I think a hero...

152
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,490
...like Captain Sonoda should
get a commemoration instead.

153
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,920
This was a tragedy
in space...

154
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,490
...caused by a star 6000
times the earth's mass.

155
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,260
Just by colliding with his discovery
as it headed toward him...

156
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,730
...it's our duty to
make him a hero.

157
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,600
Six thousand times
must be an error.

158
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,100
The object is only three
quarters the size of earth.

159
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,100
Oh...?

160
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,670
You say an object three
quarters the size of earth...

161
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,280
...has a mass of 6000 times?

162
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,710
Well, the investigation into the cause
of the accident should not have to wait.

163
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,680
But it must be put aside.

164
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:38,320
Regarding the situation of Saturn's exploration,
when and who gave the order to change plans?

165
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,790
Did the order come
from the astronauts?

166
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
The order didn't
come from them.

167
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,700
If the order didn't come from the
astronauts, then this is a big problem.

168
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,270
Well, well, Kinami...

169
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,510
You shouldn't fuss about what happened
that time among the world astronomers.

170
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,640
The solar astronomers and the Gorath observatory
team were probably both involved with this.

171
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,050
Is it alright for instructions to be altered
in mid-flight to suit one's needs?

172
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,250
The spaceship was representing
the country of Japan.

173
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,960
The expectations of Saturn's exploration were
great, but the safety of the nation is primary.

174
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,130
Don't talk to me about that.

175
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,530
Minister, we should try to
learn who gave the order.

176
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,200
The astronomer, Doctor Kono
is here to see you.

177
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,870
Oh, thank you.
We were just finishing.

178
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,970
Well, let them in.

179
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,780
Please sit.

180
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,700
Thank you for seeing us.

181
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,330
We've reached a conclusion.

182
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,660
Gorath is now on a
collision course with earth.

183
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,840
Are you certain of this?

184
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,500
We confirmed our conclusion
with our counterparts in America.

185
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,050
Institutes of every nation have
analyzed the data of JX-1...

186
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,150
...and they are wiring us
with their reports.

187
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,090
We have a request to make.

188
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,360
This time, let us work with the scientists
of the U.N. To develop a defense.

189
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,160
This problem isn't just a
concern of Japan any longer.

190
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,570
The world has turned its
attention to Gorath...

191
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,840
... and a sense of urgency
has gripped the populace.

192
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:42,450
Soon, Japan and the United Nations will work
together to develop a defense for its arrival.

193
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,680
You are not allowed to see
Dr. Kono or Dr. Tazawa!

194
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,110
Yeah, you must be joking...

195
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,940
I was invited at his request.

196
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,210
I'm supposed to see him today.

197
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,890
Alright!

198
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,170
Hey! Hey!

199
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,480
Hey! What are you doing?!
This isn't a game this time!

200
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,020
His P-wave is a little large.

201
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,600
Hey!

202
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,550
Hey, wait!

203
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,480
Hey!

204
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,260
Damned idiot!

205
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,980
I guess I'll be going.

206
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,260
Hey! Where are you going?!

207
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,860
Just wait a few moments please!

208
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,600
Hey! What's the matter?

209
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,960
The captain has landed!

210
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,910
The captain!
The captain has arrived!

211
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,110
Let's go!

212
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,180
Let's go!

213
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,780
Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

214
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,750
Captain!
- Captain!

215
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,610
How is it?

216
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,200
Damn! He wouldn't feel any regret
if the mission was cancelled!

217
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,330
What?!

218
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,630
That's crazy!

219
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,800
Hey, everyone huddle!

220
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,810
Alright!
- Let's do it!

221
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,810
Let's go!

222
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,870
JX-1's accident occurred as they
were warning earth of our crisis...

223
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,140
...and we are deeply
honored to...

224
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,380
It's alright.
I'll get it.

225
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,250
What do you want?

226
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,460
We want to go on the
Gorath observation mission.

227
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,890
Director, please do not
cancel the mission.

228
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,730
You should be telling
this to your captain.

229
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,420
The captain behaves like he has a gun
to his head if he doesn't cancel it!

230
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,330
Is he dead?

231
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,340
We needed to pull on your ear to let you
know that we want our chance to help.

232
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,910
You're not ready!

233
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,310
Captain Endo has pulled on the
director's ear for five years already!

234
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,080
Director...

235
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,320
Quiet!

236
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,760
Come in.

237
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,130
Sit down.

238
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,960
Director, since the initial discovery of
Gorath, we would like to know about...

239
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,400
...the data warning of earth's crisis
gathered by our predecessors.

240
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,480
However, we haven't been
able to get anyone to pull...

241
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,480
...the astronomy
observation for us.

242
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,410
Well, once we learned of
the orders to cancel it...

243
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,480
...we thought we'd never get it.

244
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,240
Who said it was cancelled?

245
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,650
I didn't hear that.

246
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,220
But the captain seemed...

247
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,760
Endo told me he was concerned that his
budget wasn't enough to launch anytime soon.

248
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,630
You don't need to
complain to me.

249
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,970
We put a lot of money into the
budget to cover your training.

250
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,000
It's no small sum of cash.

251
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,310
Do any of you know how much
money went into JX-1 project?

252
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:01,120
About 11,800,010,000 yen...
One of earth's top five projects...

253
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,920
Wow, they spent a lot of cash.

254
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,430
That's right.

255
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,090
A great deal of money was spent.

256
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,960
It was a painful loss for us.

257
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,930
However, it wasn't
without some benefit.

258
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,190
Now, that type of budget
has been allocated for you.

259
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,590
Are you tired?

260
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,320
No, that's not what I'd call it.

261
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,620
It's whenever the professor
requests our presence.

262
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,960
I'd feel much better if
I could get some sleep.

263
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,500
They told me I'd do this hundreds of
times if I became a government official.

264
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,910
The time, driver... Do you have any idea
what time Gorath is supposed to arrive?

265
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,600
Gorath...?
Not for a long time.

266
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,950
What is it, sir?

267
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,150
How many times can you talk about
a star that's on a collision course?

268
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,410
Once is bad enough for me.

269
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,090
But the newspaper and radio...

270
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,280
Hah! It's their business
to make noise!

271
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,960
Are you concerned about
the world's scholars?

272
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,570
Well, I'm sure the scholar's theories will
provide a way to escape the collision.

273
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,300
If it doesn't work...

274
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,800
...we'll be in trouble, huh?

275
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,010
Some way to go, huh?

276
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,450
To know you can't avoid it whether
you run north, south, east or west.

277
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,650
Most of mankind doesn't care where or when it
hits, they're just waiting for the end to come.

278
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,590
It's Kano, grandfather.

279
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,430
Hello. Did I pull you
away from anything?

280
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,800
You should have seen the
expression on Tazawa's face.

281
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,900
He was going to treat the
astronauts to a day out.

282
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,740
As we were returning in the car, he claimed he
saw your face and knew you wanted to see him.

283
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,580
Welcome...

284
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,050
For Kano, let's bring out
the whiskey tonight.

285
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,190
Thank you very much.
Is that okay?

286
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,690
No, thank you. I have an
academic meeting to attend.

287
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,820
It's no trouble.

288
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,690
What would you like to have?
Would you rather something from the kitchen?

289
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,990
You have some time to
have a bowl of rice with us.

290
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:26,760
Yes...

291
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,600
It's important that you
enjoy yourself a little, okay?

292
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,440
He's right.

293
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,500
You can get back to
Gorath soon enough.

294
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,770
Well, I guess you're right.

295
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,580
Okay, I'll have a drink.

296
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,780
Me too!

297
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,710
No.

298
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,240
Just a little!

299
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,550
What are you saying?!

300
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,790
If the earth is going to be hit by Gorath,
I should be able to have at least one drink!

301
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,090
Don't be ridiculous.

302
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,690
They won't collide as long as Kano and
Tazawa have something to do about it.

303
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
How are they going
to save the earth?

304
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,270
Regarding that, we don't
have a clear plan at this time.

305
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,730
How about the scientists
of the United Nations?

306
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,210
Some countries are
building spaceships...

307
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,570
...but honestly, Japan's scientists
are putting the others to shame.

308
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,840
Our government's ship
hasn't been outdone.

309
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,720
The government, the nation, and we
are working hard to solve this problem.

310
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,660
America hasn't come
to that point yet.

311
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,160
I don't believe anyone is as
comfortable with it as we are.

312
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,600
Can't we use an atomic weapon?

313
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,440
An explosive, huh?

314
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,170
That's not very difficult.

315
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,040
Well, it would get the
earth out of the way.

316
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,010
How would it get us
out of the way?

317
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,880
For example...

318
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,440
...we could launch a rocket, or see
what our spaceships could do.

319
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,190
That's silly...
It would never get away.

320
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,850
But if there's a chance
it would work...

321
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,220
...wouldn't it turn away
from the earth?

322
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,090
Simply put, it's too much
trouble for anyone.

323
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,200
Haven't you said enough?

324
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,460
Here.

325
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,470
Please...

326
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,400
Doctor...?

327
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,780
He's on the right track.

328
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,710
We have two potential ideas
to avoid the collision.

329
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,490
Can Gorath be destroyed?
Can the earth be moved?

330
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,960
Mankind can't be limited
to two choices!

331
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,040
Tonight, mankind's scholars must advance
the war against the approaching threat.

332
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,370
But for the sake of all humanity, we can no
longer sacrifice the truth of our situation.

333
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:56,480
Right now, our scientists are
determining if there is a way...

334
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,410
...to avoid colliding with
the approaching star.

335
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,720
Our scientists are facing
their greatest challenge.

336
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,560
We must give them any
assistance that we can.

337
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,160
As you can see, Gorath's path entered
our solar system over 45 days ago.

338
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,370
So, if the earth is to
avoid its end...

339
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,470
...we can't allow it to travel
within 400,000 kilometers of us.

340
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,320
I recommend a blast of 6.6
hundred million megatons...

341
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:40,390
...derived from the formula 1.1
x 10 to the minus 6th power g.

342
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,830
We do... Heavy water reactors,
of which thirty are currently in use.

343
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,580
Using their reactors will give us
an unlimited supply of energy.

344
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,790
No, there's no need to worry.

345
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,660
Through phases of research, we Japanese
have met with success in its decontamination.

346
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,170
The top scientists from
the world have come here.

347
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,770
They're going to move the earth.

348
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,570
Incredible, huh? Can they return
the earth to... Oh, just a moment.

349
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,380
How is it? Can we blast
out of Gorath's way?

350
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,980
The military believes
they can do it.

351
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,680
From the data they gathered from
the observatory, it's very possible.

352
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,520
Excuse me.

353
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,220
When are you returning to Japan?

354
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm going back now.
Why don't you speak to Tazawa?

355
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,500
Tazawa!

356
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,900
Tazawa!

357
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,540
These are the drastic
changes we can expect...

358
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,300
...if Gorath comes within
200,000 kilometers of us.

359
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:11,910
Earthquakes, mountains crumbling, volcanoes erupt.
Even Mt. Fuji would become a killer volcano.

360
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,250
Along with this, the air
and water would be...

361
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,020
... stripped away by Gorath's
gravitational influence.

362
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,850
This is the fate of our oceans.

363
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,890
The sheer cliffs make Japan
look like a dead island.

364
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,430
We wouldn't have any clouds.

365
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,000
Earth's atmosphere would be littered
with the broken remains of the surface...

366
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,430
... and the population would need artificial
breathers to the replace the air lost in space.

367
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,040
This slide presentation
was created from...

368
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,580
...the data generated by
the United Nation scientists.

369
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,700
Some things in particular
may not occur, of course...

370
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,100
But if Gorath's present
course is unaltered...

371
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,300
...you can be sure that situations
like this, will happen.

372
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,030
What a terrible place...

373
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,700
We can't afford to let this happen
without saying something.

374
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,010
We have to support the scientists in
whatever choice they believe is best.

375
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,320
Minister...

376
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,320
A letter from U.N. Headquarters urges us to
dispatch our ship to Gorath for further studies.

377
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,790
Hey, let's have a good luck drink!
- Alright!

378
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,030
I'll have another!

379
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
Thank you.

380
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,270
Gorath is getting closer every day.

381
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,710
If you guys can make
it into space...

382
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,010
...you'll get to see
Gorath run us over.

383
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,080
A toast!

384
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,550
A toast!

385
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,060
Captain!

386
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,260
Emergency orders.

387
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,690
Our launch time has changed.

388
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
That's funny...

389
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,000
Where's Kanai?!

390
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,020
Space pilot, Tetsuo Kanai!

391
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,950
You still behave like you
did in high school!

392
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,490
Thank you...
My, you're pretty!

393
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,220
What are you saying?
Hurry, get inside!

394
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,630
Did you drop by just to joke around?
This is a quiet apartment complex!

395
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,600
I know that!
I brought you a present.

396
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,260
A present?

397
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,140
It must be something very funny.

398
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,110
Is this the real thing?

399
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,740
I held onto this for
the Saturn trip...

400
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,480
...but I'm not sure if this is the first
or last present I'll ever give you.

401
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,490
Why are you giving
it to me now?

402
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,710
I don't need to tell you!

403
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,020
But, this is pretty expensive
for a cadet's pay!

404
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,590
I may not have done it
under different circumstances.

405
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,230
We launch tomorrow.
I know we'll leave shortly.

406
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,200
Your ship is launching?

407
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,200
Yes, we're going
to observe Gorath.

408
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,500
My...!

409
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,240
Is that all you can say?

410
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,340
I have to call Kiyo tonight
and let her know!

411
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,640
She'll find out in time if
she doesn't already know.

412
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,910
She probably went to see
us in the south district.

413
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,880
There's no doubt she'll succeed
in finding the others.

414
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,250
I just want to know how
you feel about all this.

415
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,190
Take it back.

416
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,570
You don't want to know.
This man and I...

417
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,400
But isn't he dead?

418
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,740
I'm not ready to believe that yet.

419
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,720
What's the matter with you?

420
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,460
You're cruel!

421
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,960
It seems you haven't grown
up since high school, either!

422
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,160
Kanai!

423
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,660
Hey, last chance to see
the earth for a month!

424
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,230
All of mankind lives
down there, huh?

425
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,670
Fathers, mothers...
and children, too.

426
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,210
Thirty minutes to
first waypoint!

427
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,780
What should we do? We don't
have to re-supply at this time.

428
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,150
Keep flying.

429
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,950
We'll decide at the France, Portugal
and Czechoslovakia checkpoints.

430
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,950
We have enough fuel to
last at least 2 to 3 hours.

431
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:06,790
Alright, don't stop.

432
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,260
Isn't that useful?

433
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,770
Those international space
stations are so close together.

434
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,370
It must have been something
when they discovered Gorath.

435
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,540
They've been a great
help to us.

436
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,240
That's not how it use to be.

437
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,310
Mankind was separated into white,
black and yellow races before the U. N...

438
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,550
Trust, honor and cooperation was
their hallmark to bring us together.

439
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,280
Come this way...
This is a model of our command center.

440
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,790
The center section is 100 meters long.
This is where our headquarters will be.

441
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,760
Alright?

442
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,570
This way.

443
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,500
The pipes will extend five
hundred meters into the ground.

444
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,470
How will the rockets be used?

445
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,340
If they weren't employed properly,
it won't work at all.

446
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,680
The rockets will all fire together, turning
the entire area into a huge fusion reactor.

447
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,880
However, their stability
is still in question.

448
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,520
In 100 days, we'll have to move the
earth more than 400,000 kilometers.

449
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,720
For that, we'll need an area
of 600 kilometers squared...

450
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,330
...producing energy equal to
6,600,000,000 megatons.

451
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,300
Oh, my!

452
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,100
Hey, can you figure out why they went to
the South Pole instead of the North Pole?

453
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,760
Can't you figure it out?

454
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,540
They went to the South Pole, because the
North Pole is made of water. That's right, huh?

455
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,320
Sonada!

456
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,670
Thank you for coming.

457
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,170
Sir, is everything alright?
Is our work keeping up to schedule?

458
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,370
Well, let's see. The international community
is well under way with Operation South Pole.

459
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,110
A few of the countries are a little behind,
but they expect to be done on schedule.

460
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,180
But this is bad...

461
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,610
They've found no other defense to
prevent Gorath from colliding with earth.

462
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,250
Is the factory moving along?

463
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,320
Yes, we had a problem with pipe
33 in the underground factory.

464
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,460
We had to make some
big adjustments.

465
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,700
Where is it?

466
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,370
Hurry, get out!

467
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,170
Come on! Come on!

468
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,890
Is there another area where
we can rebuild the factory?

469
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,700
Well, we can't do it here.

470
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,840
We'll have to decide on another
location and start from scratch.

471
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,140
Well, it can't be helped.

472
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,200
How many days do we
have to play with?

473
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,680
Count on little more than sixty
days loss by my calculations.

474
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,240
Gorath won't wait past that.

475
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,310
Sonada, do you have any
information about our ship?

476
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,670
They'll be within range shortly.

477
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,990
Take emergency positions!

478
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,390
Capsule, prepare for takeoff!

479
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,530
Hey, get out of bed!

480
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,650
Hey, hurry out of there!

481
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,440
Braking rockets, fire!

482
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,840
Braking rockets, fire!

483
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,300
Beginning braking procedure!

484
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,220
Hey! Hurry, hurry!

485
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,770
Captain...

486
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,040
Gorath's pull is vastly greater
than we had anticipated.

487
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,110
By how much?

488
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,010
Sixty-two hundred times
greater than earth's.

489
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,250
No mistake?

490
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,320
There's no doubt about it.

491
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,420
Captain...

492
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,490
Our ship can't possibly
observe Gorath if it's that big.

493
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,620
From 6000 to 6200 times...

494
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,890
We have to figure out how it grew 200
times greater then the earth's mass.

495
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,160
But captain...

496
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,400
Our original course was based on
its mass being 6000 times greater.

497
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,860
Even 6100 times is too
much for our ship!

498
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,670
It's not hard to figure
out how it grew.

499
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,770
The truth is that the scientists
were right all along!

500
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,610
See captain?

501
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,210
Gorath is larger from the debris it's
collected on its present journey!

502
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,840
The capsule is ready
for departure!

503
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,780
Crewman Kanai,
board the capsule.

504
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,020
Yes, sir!
I'm boarding the capsule now!

505
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,620
Takeoff in five minutes!

506
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,130
Kanai, Gorath's gravity has increased.

507
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,810
It's alright, we have increased
the distance to compensate.

508
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,820
This time, we'll avoid the
same fate as JX-1.

509
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,490
Roger!

510
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,020
Don't say "roger", yet!

511
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,620
I haven't told you
the total gravity.

512
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,090
If you think it's too dangerous,
you don't have to go.

513
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,030
Roger!

514
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,590
Don't "Roger", me yet!

515
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,400
It's vital that we register
Gorath's current strength...

516
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,100
... but not to risk your life...

517
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,830
...just to obtain accurate data!

518
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,140
Captain, I know my
life is important.

519
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:57,200
Roger!

520
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,840
Prepare for departure!

521
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,310
Preparing for departure!

522
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,800
Opening capsule launch bay!

523
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,650
Takeoff in 10 seconds!

524
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,500
This is JX-2. Report!

525
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,870
This is Capsule 1...

526
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,700
I don't have an accurate
reading of the star's mass!

527
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,940
It's useless!
Maintain a safe distance!

528
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:54,220
Capsule 1! Capsule 1!
Capsule 1!

529
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,010
Capsule 1! Capsule 1!

530
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,520
Kanai, evasive maneuvers!

531
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,330
The capsule has
successfully pulled away.

532
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,030
Prepare to retrieve the capsule!

533
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,100
Prepare to retrieve the capsule!

534
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,420
At 6200 times the earth's mass...

535
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,020
... how can we possibly avoid
something this powerful?

536
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,960
Until we can thoroughly study
the capsule's readings...

537
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,130
...avoiding Gorath is impossible.

538
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:47,530
Yes, sir.

539
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,400
Captain, something's
wrong with Kanai!

540
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:52,670
What's the matter?

541
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,870
We're not sure.

542
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,270
Kanai!

543
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,340
Kanai, look at me!

544
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,940
Understand?
It's me! It's me!

545
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,620
Who is in this picture?

546
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,790
Don't you know who's
in the picture?

547
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,830
It's your girlfriend!

548
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,230
Don't you know who she is?!

549
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,990
Hey! That's enough!

550
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,470
Give me just a little longer!

551
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,540
Hey, Kanai...

552
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,640
Kanai! I'm your best friend!
Kanai! Kanai!

553
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,710
Hey, stop that!

554
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,980
What's the matter, Kanai?

555
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,480
Kanai...

556
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,180
Kanai...

557
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,400
You... Who are you?

558
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,030
He's lost all of his memories.

559
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,530
8 minutes, 20 seconds to go!

560
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,280
It's impossible to say if this will
take us out of Gorath's path.

561
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,160
And so, the countdown
nears completion...

562
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,500
These jet pipes will unleash a force equal
to 6,600,000,000 megatons into the sky...

563
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,730
But will it be enough to
move the earth?

564
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,900
Will we accelerate enough?

565
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,170
Sixty-five seconds!

566
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,870
The fate of the earth...

567
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,140
... and all of mankind hopes, rest
in these powerful thrusters.

568
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,550
High above our world...

569
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,690
... back from the far reaches
of Jupiter and Mars...

570
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,820
... the crew of the JX-2 have returned
from their observation of Gorath...

571
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,190
... and have relayed their data to the
awaiting ears of the scientists here.

572
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,090
Twenty-five seconds remaining.

573
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,460
All stations stand-by.

574
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,770
All systems are go.

575
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:37,870
All thrusters are ready for firing.

576
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,500
All systems ready!

577
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,800
Ten seconds...

578
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,700
This is U.N. Space station command.

579
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:50,260
It's a success! The 6,600,000,000 megaton
thrust is beginning to move the earth!

580
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,620
A huge success! A huge success!

581
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,850
The south pole operation
has become a huge success!

582
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,460
Mankind has succeeded
in moving the earth!

583
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:34,610
You have a phone
call from Tokyo.

584
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,290
I heard it was
from a pretty lady!

585
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,650
Professor, excuse me...

586
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,660
What do you want?

587
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,260
We wanted to hear
from you! Congratulations!

588
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,930
Anyway, Tokyo is
celebrating your success!

589
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,930
It's not every day that
you can move a planet!

590
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,400
You're right!
Thanks for the...

591
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,060
Hold on just a moment...

592
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,440
Congratulations on your success.

593
01:01:58,740 --> 01:01:59,610
Thank you.

594
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,940
I'm truly proud of you.

595
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,710
Thank you.

596
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:04,540
I suppose you two...

597
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,410
...want to talk in private, huh?

598
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,180
Don't be such a nosy pest!

599
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,250
The earth is still moving on course,
but you don't seem very comfortable about it.

600
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,550
Yes, yes... It's because
of this whole situation.

601
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,390
My heart won't find any
comfort until it's over.

602
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Doctor Tazawa is here to see you.

603
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,020
Oh, when did you return
from the South Pole?

604
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,250
This morning.

605
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,990
I was on my way to New York, but I
came to Tokyo to speak with the doctor.

606
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,730
That's very unusual.

607
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,130
Don't try to argue with me about
the South Pole operation again!

608
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,270
But, doctor...!

609
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,700
The U.N. Feels we have
enough for the job.

610
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,610
They don't want to worry
about more thrusters.

611
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,410
Gorath's mass is
continuously growing!

612
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,380
We need to add more jets
if the earth is to survive!

613
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,380
Oh, my...!

614
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,250
It's alright...
His theory is groundless.

615
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,120
Would you allow me to
prove my theory?

616
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,660
The U.N. Is satisfied with
our current situation.

617
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,320
If we wait while we're satisfied, what
do we do if something goes wrong?

618
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,460
Don't you realize that you're
putting the human race at risk?

619
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,760
You shouldn't speak like
that to Dr. Kono.

620
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,800
No, I beg your pardon...

621
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,560
Please think about what
I said to you. I beg you...

622
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,040
I'll think about it.

623
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,480
But I must tell you that I am
still opposed to such an idea.

624
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,240
Now, now... Why don't we let
Tazawa relax for a while?

625
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,180
Yes.

626
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,120
Come with me. You must be
tired after your trip.

627
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:53,650
Yes, I am.

628
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,730
And just what do you think
you were doing there?

629
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,740
I'm part of the human race. I should be
allowed to hear of any emergencies!

630
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,210
Tazawa is right.

631
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:22,150
Gorath is so big right now, it will be
drawing our water into the atmosphere.

632
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,090
Even the earth's
water contained...

633
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,590
...in the North and South Poles
will be drawn by Gorath.

634
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:33,530
Then why won't you tell the
U.N. What Tazawa told you?

635
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,630
Isn't it your duty as a scientist
to do your best until the end?

636
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,900
The truth is that the U.N. Knows that nothing,
short of divine intervention, can save us.

637
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,340
The younger generation
working on the solution...

638
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,640
...just can't understand that.

639
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,780
It's a very dark
day for us all.

640
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,450
How can we continue
to do our best?

641
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,190
There must be more to our
existence than this.

642
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,290
Am I the only one
left who cares?

643
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:18,940
There doesn't seem to be anyone who'll listen.
This can't be the downfall of mankind!

644
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,470
It seems that our fate
is already decided.

645
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,050
No, you shouldn't allow
yourself to cry.

646
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,290
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't
have anyone to give us hope.

647
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,990
Even if it's the earth's doom...

648
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,360
...or mankind's doom...

649
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,490
...you gave hope to...

650
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,270
...the people of the world.

651
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,470
Thank you.

652
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,850
Attention space station...

653
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:04,590
This is the U.N. Gorath
Countermeasures Center calling.

654
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,660
Spaceship JX-2 is
to leave right away...

655
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:11,890
... to check on Gorath's
present course and velocity.

656
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,400
Afterwards, the crew is ordered
to return to the earth. Over...

657
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:16,530
Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

658
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,180
Yes, we must not forget to check
this in another 4 to 5 hours.

659
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,270
An earthquake!

660
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,350
What is it?
What's going on?

661
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,820
Hey!

662
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,700
Hey, hey! Something has
happened at the South Pole!

663
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,400
An earthquake or something!

664
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,780
Dr. Kono is on the phone.

665
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,970
Kono is in New York.

666
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,710
He's calling from the U. N...
- Oh, really?

667
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,060
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

668
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:23,560
Would you like to go to
the South Pole soon?

669
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,490
The South Pole?

670
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,520
Not for too long, just on
the surface. I'm going too.

671
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,200
What's going on down there?

672
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:32,200
I'll tell you on the way, okay?

673
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,340
Hello? Hello? Hey!

674
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,950
There's no doubt that this is evidence that
some kind of animal caused the damage.

675
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:58,990
Amazing... I didn't think an animal existed
down here that could give us any trouble.

676
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:02,230
No, it's a mystery of the earth.

677
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,330
The animals and natural
wonders of the world...

678
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,770
...are more than we can realize.

679
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,970
Dr. Tazawa, this is the control center.
The jet pipes are ready to be re-ignited.

680
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:15,470
Alright.

681
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:30,990
That's it!

682
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,560
It's the warming
of the South Pole.

683
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,420
Perhaps it freed
something within the ice.

684
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,920
It would be a
shame to kill it.

685
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,220
I'm sure it just wants the temperature
to be returned to normal.

686
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,650
Professor, for that thing's sake, we'll
need to distract it for at least 72 hours.

687
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,200
It's bound to create trouble
for the earth once again.

688
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,770
Prepare to fire.

689
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,880
Preparing to fire!

690
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:24,680
Fire!
- Fire!

691
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,500
Want a closer look?

692
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,800
Alright, land!

693
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:49,560
Landing!

694
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,640
That pile!

695
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,260
Do you think it's dead?

696
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,790
It's still alive!

697
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,890
We should head back
to the ship.

698
01:11:58,910 --> 01:11:59,380
Look out!

699
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,310
Hurry! Let's go!

700
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,550
Fire!
- Fire!

701
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,160
Captain, I've located
Gorath's position!

702
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,740
Gorath has passed Saturn...

703
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,270
... and still making its
way toward the earth.

704
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,840
Certain changes will take place when
Gorath gets closer to our planet.

705
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,410
Ocean levels will begin to rise
in the North and South Poles.

706
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,450
Strong winds and high tides will
begin to affect portions of the world.

707
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,120
Water levels could rise as high as 100
meters in various low-lying areas.

708
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,790
It's recommended that all citizens go to
their nearest shelters as soon as they can.

709
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,590
What's the matter with
you today? Hurry up!

710
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,760
Regardless of where we go,
it's all the same.

711
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,100
We're all going to die.

712
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,600
What are you saying?!

713
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,830
When Gorath finally
reaches the earth...

714
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,410
...how do we know that
everyone won't be killed?

715
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,680
Don't be silly!

716
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,990
Oh, Kanai! When did
you return home?

717
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,460
He has amnesia.

718
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,570
Well, come in.

719
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:59,380
The truth is, we were hoping that his seeing
you would trigger some of his memories.

720
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,710
Kanai!

721
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,450
I'm sorry.

722
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,720
His memory seems to
be completely gone.

723
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,690
That's it!

724
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:17,500
You can take him to his
sister in the Shibuya district!

725
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,730
We went there, but she moved
to the Yamagata area recently.

726
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,370
I'm worried...
The hospital couldn't help him.

727
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,880
Kanai, is it true that
you don't know me?

728
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:34,610
Hey, it's Taiko.
You don't remember her?

729
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,410
Well...?

730
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:38,550
Please stop.

731
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,210
We thought that you would be
the first person he'd recognize.

732
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,620
Hey... We're sorry.

733
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:48,530
Just a moment... We should take
him with us to my home.

734
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:53,330
You're a close friend of his. He may
regain his memory if he stays with you.

735
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:57,270
Is that so? Well, then I'll
leave him with you.

736
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,400
Hey... You hang in
there, okay?

737
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,930
This is the Gorath Civil-Defense
Service announcement.

738
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,230
Tonight, Gorath can
be clearly seen...

739
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:25,930
... in the skies of Tokyo as if
it were a large full moon.

740
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:29,600
Those who are not in the northern hemisphere
may not be able to view Gorath's approach...

741
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,710
But people in the northern
hemisphere are warned...

742
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,840
...that as Gorath approaches the
earth, tides will rise drastically.

743
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,660
What worries me most is that Japan
will have to endure it for six hours.

744
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:56,730
This is the Maritime Bureau...

745
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,270
At 23:00 hours, the tides rose
10 meters above safe levels.

746
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,760
Assume emergency positions!

747
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:08,400
This is the South Pole
reactor center.

748
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,640
At 23:00 hours Tokyo time, a state
of emergency has been declared.

749
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,010
At this time, keep your radio or
television switched on to this station.

750
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,580
At this time, keep your radio or
television switched on to this station.

751
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,030
What is its current speed?

752
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,260
Good.

753
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:12,940
Sea levels are beginning to rise
higher as morning approaches.

754
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,000
The central Pacific, Japan Sea and other large
bodies of water are surging to high levels.

755
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,530
Haiyo, what do you think you're doing?!
Come inside, quickly!

756
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:15,900
It's okay!

757
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,870
The north side of the
mountain is falling apart!

758
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,660
Kanai! Don't do it! Don't!

759
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,300
Kanai! Kanai!

760
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,800
Keep him down!
Hold him down!

761
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,740
Bring some water in here!

762
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:02,780
Bring it quickly!

763
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,050
Hold on, Kanai!

764
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:10,980
This is the South Pole station.

765
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:15,090
The waters have risen to such a level
that they are flooding onto the jet-pipes!

766
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,400
The success of our
efforts is upon us!

767
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:14,250
In two minutes, just two minutes,
Gorath will be at its closest point to us!

768
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:18,890
Kanai!

769
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:19,720
Kanai!

770
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,080
What's wrong?

771
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,470
Kanai!

772
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,180
Kanai!

773
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,470
Kanai!

774
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,780
Kanai! Kanai!

775
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:56,750
He's alright!

776
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:02,830
It's you!

777
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,300
You finally know who I am?

778
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,880
Just a moment,
where is Gorath now?

779
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:15,840
Well, it's about
to pass the earth.

780
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:07,910
People of the world, Operation
South Pole is a success!

781
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,520
The earth is out of danger!

782
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:14,030
Our science and the scientists of
mankind have saved the earth!

783
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,320
The mysterious star, Gorath, is passing
the earth and heading toward deep space!

784
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,740
The wind has calmed down!

785
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:28,240
Well...

786
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:31,950
With Gorath out of the way, I guess we
should call Tazawa to congratulate him.

787
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:32,780
Yes!

788
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,780
Units 1 through 10,
prepare to shut down.

789
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:54,340
But, we'll need twice the nuclear power
to put it back into its proper orbit.

790
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,930
I'd say it's like
walking on water.

791
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,480
We'll do it.

792
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,740
Here in Tokyo and the
surrounding area...

793
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:06,250
... things are returning
to normal peacefully.

794
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,980
As Gorath moves further
away from the earth...

795
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:13,890
... the flood waters are draining
back to where they belong.

796
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:17,120
All of Tokyo is ruined!

797
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:19,280
We can build a new,
better Tokyo.

798
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,830
That's easy for you to say!

799
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,830
You're right.

800
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,660
But Tazawa taught us
from the South Pole...

801
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,030
...that mankind is capable
of doing the impossible.

802
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:31,200
This time, we'll build
Tokyo into a model city!

803
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,210
And now, the United Nations would like
us to pass this message on to you...

804
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:39,210
"Everyone, we have just begun.

805
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,820
"Together, we overcame the doom
of the suspicious star, Gorath.

806
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:49,390
"If we could come together and cooperate to
overcome the danger that threatened us...

807
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,630
"Can't we take this opportunity
to work together for all eternity?"
