1
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,077
Are you in there?

2
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:47,892
I feel I have a great deal of promise.

3
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:50,295
- Promise?
- Yes, unlimited potential.

4
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:53,654
- I graduated near the top of my class.
- Uh-huh.

5
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:56,241
I see you've been out of school
for a year already.

6
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:59,476
Well, okay, yes. But I think
that's a little misleading.

7
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,124
I look at this past year
as a period of real growth for me...

8
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:06,193
in terms of preparation
for the future.

9
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:10,258
- What are your goals?
- Goals? You mean
in terms of architecture?

10
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:12,816
Where do you see yourself,
let's say, five years from now?

11
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:15,224
Oh. Well, um...

12
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:19,065
It would be great to get this job
so I can get out of my mom's house.

13
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:22,745
No. Five years from now.

14
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,777
I'd have to say...

15
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:29,809
Well on my way, sir.
That's where I see myself.

16
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:32,301
I see a lot of room
for me to grow here,

17
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:35,376
and I don't want you to concern
yourself with this past year.

18
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,099
I'm the first to admit
I had a little difficulty...

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,241
just as far as
forward momentum,

20
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:44,752
but I've had a lot
of job interviews recently,
and I don't want to say anything,

21
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:47,856
but I feel like I'm on the verge
of a real breakthrough, I really do.

22
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:51,190
And I think big things
are gonna happen.

23
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,625
Well, I'm certainly
on your side, Tim.

24
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,550
- Tom.
- Tom.

25
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:00,589
Tom Thompson.

26
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,735
Hello?

27
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,773
Tom!

28
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,407
Tom!

29
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:39,253
Tom!

30
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,813
- Phone call.
- Who is it?

31
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,813
It's a girl.

32
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,740
- Hey, what's this friggin' lock?
- Not now.

33
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,594
Hey!

34
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,769
- Hello?
- Is this Tom?

35
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,652
Tom Thompson?

36
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:07,825
- Who is this?
- It's Ruth Abernathy, Bill's mom.

37
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:12,597
Bill's... dead.

38
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:27,819
- I have to talk to you.
I'm, like, shaking.
- Did you get the job?

39
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:31,219
- Do you remember a guy
named Bill Abernathy?
- No. So you didn't get the job.

40
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:34,251
This has nothing to do with the job.
Come on, think. From high school?

41
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:36,810
- Look, I don't remember him.
Are you okay?
- No?

42
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:39,633
- Is that your Brooks Brothers?
- I had to do some research at the firm.

43
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:42,765
- You can't bowl in your Brooks Brothers.
- Where's Brad?

44
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:45,453
He's on the phone.
He won't get off.

45
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:49,299
Glass. Brad Glass.
Right, from Brooklyn.

46
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:51,731
No, no, no,
United States.

47
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:55,024
Sorry to wake you.
What time there?

48
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:58,058
He's been trying
to reach that guy in Japan
about that stupid dog breeding thing.

49
00:05:58,163 --> 00:06:01,478
- We have to talk to you. Hang up.
- Miss Tsumaki. Miss Tsumaki!

50
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:04,304
Six dollars a minute,
this woman keeps putting me on hold.

51
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,608
- Did you get the job?
- Get off. I have to talk to you.

52
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,643
- Is that your Brooks Brothers?
- Do you remember
a guy named Bill Abernathy?

53
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,529
- Miss Tsumaki?
- What happened at the interview?

54
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:15,409
- They claim they're gonna call me.
- Hello? Hello? Listen.

55
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,289
Very important. I need feedback
from husband about business proposal.

56
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:20,721
- Can he call back?
I have him call you back.
- Chihuahua.

57
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,794
- Okay. I call back.
- Yeah, call back.

58
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,721
- I call back.
- Call back.

59
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,601
- Okay. Bye-bye. Bye!
- Good-bye. 'Bye.

60
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,441
Listen, I'm trying to run
a business here. That's a business call.

61
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,077
I'm sorry to interrupt your business
call, but Bill Abernathy is dead.

62
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:39,946
Who's Bill Abernathy?

63
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,181
Before I get the chance to tell
this very mysterious-sounding woman...

64
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:46,063
that I basically have
no recollection of her son,

65
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,464
- she just starts crying.
- She cried?

66
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:50,864
- Jesus, who is this woman?
- I don't know.

67
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,606
But there were these long stretches,
nothing but crying, for like minutes.

68
00:06:57,138 --> 00:07:00,270
I feel really bad for the lady.

69
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,152
She sounds like
a nice, warm person.

70
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,638
- So I guess I'm gonna need a suit.
- For what?

71
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:13,552
Hello? What have we been talking
about? I'm gonna be a pallbearer.

72
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,689
- What?
- You didn't get out of it?

73
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,990
Are you done laughing? This is
my whole point. I'm in big trouble.

74
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,674
- How could you tell her "yes"?
- I told you, there was crying.

75
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,598
How am I supposed to
respond to that?

76
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,551
Call her up.
Tell her you got back trouble.

77
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,472
It's no good.
I am in, I am committed.

78
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,708
I am just gonna have to
do this one little thing for her.

79
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:33,258
It starts off as
one little thing, all of a sudden
you're enmeshed in a situation.

80
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,776
- This could be part
of a whole scam operation.
- What?

81
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:41,485
One minute you're
carrying this guy's coffin,
the next you're lying in a ditch naked.

82
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:50,666
- Is that suit black?
- No, it's a charcoal gray weave
with a chalk stripe. Why?

83
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,543
- What are you, 40 regular?
Scott, please.
- No, no.

84
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,779
I wear this suit to work.
This is my main work suit.

85
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,789
I have a problem here.
I have to look presentable.

86
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,753
This is a $600 suit.

87
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,749
- Now I'm starting to see you
for who you really are.
- Come on.

88
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:07,237
No, I'm serious. What if it were Brad
lying in the coffin?

89
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,448
Whoa! What are you
talkin' about, "Brad"?

90
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:12,334
Hey, all the shit you eat,
your heart's a time bomb.

91
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:16,011
That's nice. That's a nice thing.
I've had enough. I gotta go.

92
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:19,690
- What do you mean? We're not done here.
- Hey, it's 10:30.

93
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,831
So? It's Tuesday night.
Can you believe him?

94
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,846
It's 10:30 already?

95
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,662
Come on, let's go.

96
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,279
If you don't lend me the suit,
Scott, I can't do it, I can't go.

97
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:33,766
- I'll have to call her back.
- That's good.
You don't need this right now.

98
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:36,107
- And don't forget the wedding shower.
- Oh, yeah. I'm not going.

99
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,379
- You're going. You're the best man.
- No.

100
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,926
How can he marry her?
She's like an albatross around his neck.

101
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:44,333
You don't understand.
It's called a relationship.

102
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,254
Oh, what?
Cynthia's an albatross.

103
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,095
Bring some wine, okay?

104
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,021
You better come.

105
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,271
- Cynthia. Hi.
- Oh, hi!

106
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,578
Oh, my God, you'll
never believe who's coming.

107
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,994
- How could you invite Jared Schneidman?
- Just relax and you'll be fine.

108
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:35,916
- Why?
- Is that what you're wearing?

109
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:38,282
Of course, it's what I'm wearing.
We're here.

110
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,169
- Wait. Who's coming?
- Now, don't panic.

111
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,051
- I'm not.
- Good. I ran into her
at D'Agostino's this morning.

112
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:45,516
- Cynthia!
- Who?
- Hi!

113
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:47,817
- Who?
- I'll be right back.

114
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,892
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Cynthia, come o...

115
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,780
- There's a lot
of single women here tonight.

116
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,700
- Who's coming, Scott?
- What are you talking about?

117
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,619
Cynthia said someone is coming.

118
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:59,531
It's not that Loretta person, is it?
Because that did not work out.

119
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:01,452
- Sweetheart...
- Shut up!

120
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,516
What the f...
That is not good dip!

121
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,444
Oh, gee. There she goes again.

122
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,250
Do you see how she,
like, spits?

123
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,388
...before you listen to me, Brad.
- Sweetheart...

124
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,793
- Shut up with the "sweetheart"!
- I don't understand.

125
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:17,259
You haven't the vaguest...

126
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:21,922
Isn't that Julie DeMarco?

127
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:25,738
- I have to borrow a shirt.
- How many times do I have to tell you...

128
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,071
- What are you doing?
- That's Julie DeMarco out there.

129
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:31,075
Don't you have any regular shirts?
Like, just a shirt?

130
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,001
What are you talking about?

131
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,914
Like that. That's a good shirt.
Don't you have any shirts like that?

132
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,347
- Yeah, I'm wearing it.
- Take it off.

133
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,266
- What?
- I have to borrow the shirt, Scott.

134
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:44,259
- What is this obsessión
with my clothes?
- I was in love with her, okay?

135
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:47,146
- So?
- "So"? So I haven't
seen her since high school.

136
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:50,691
Imagine that she sees me
and I'm wearing the same fuckin' shirt!

137
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:55,461
Look, I just got this shirt.

138
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:09,795
- Guys.
- He wants to borrow my shirt now.

139
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,386
Whatever. We gotta
do something about the dip.

140
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:14,379
Lauren's having a frigging
conniption out there.

141
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:17,158
Did you leave your answering machine
on? I gave Tsumaki the phone number.

142
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,292
I got a line on a couple
of prize-winning dogs.

143
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:24,550
- What's wrong with the dip?
- Lauren's sisters are
all lactose-intolerant.

144
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,066
"Lactose"?
Don't marry her, Brad.

145
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,490
- Lauren...
- He doesn't care. Julie, Julie.

146
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:35,073
Is it too much to ask that I could have
one dip for me and my sisters to enjoy?

147
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:38,048
- What about salsa?
- Salsa! I love... I love salsa.

148
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,693
T... Tom! You remember Julie DeMarco.
She's back in Brooklyn.

149
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:47,070
Oh! Hi, sure, yes.
Didn't you move away senior year?

150
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:50,593
- Yeah, Long Island.
- Her father made
a killing in real estate.

151
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:55,041
Julie's right.
Salsa, guacamole. It is so obvious.

152
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,463
You know what? I think I have
some avocado in the kitchen.

153
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,479
- Let's take a look.
- I just want to tell you one thing.

154
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,733
- Did you ever think salsa or guacamole?
- Okay.

155
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,386
So, you... Wow.
You look, uh, really...

156
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:11,239
Oh, God.
Well, that's really...

157
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:13,225
Hey, Mary Lou!

158
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:16,519
God! Jared Schneidman?

159
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:19,039
I-I know.
D-Do you know he's engaged?

160
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:23,107
He is not! Oh, my God!

161
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,300
- Everybody's getting married.
- I know! It's like
a virus or something.

162
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:30,304
I know. I mean, I was,
you know, supposed to, but...

163
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,272
- Oh.
- You know, it didn't work out.
But, yeah...

164
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:38,119
But I thought for sure you would
have been snatched up by now.

165
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:41,729
Oh...
So you remember me?

166
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,801
Tom! What,
are you kidding?

167
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:47,325
So you think I would
have been snatched up, huh?

168
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,247
Well, you know, a lot of giris
were, uh, after you.

169
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:52,166
- No.
- Yes.

170
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:54,435
- No.
- Yes!

171
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:56,359
- What about that girl?
- Who?

172
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,937
Oh, you know, uh, Shelly.
Shelly What's-Her-Name. She loved you.

173
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,462
- I have no idea
who you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

174
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,469
Remember, you guys did that play,
that musical together?

175
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,122
- Musical? No, I don't...
- Yeah, you were great.
You had a great voice.

176
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:11,808
I don't... sing.

177
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:14,945
What do you mean?

178
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:19,869
I'm Tom Thompson.
We were in band together.

179
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,379
Oh.

180
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:33,892
- You okay?
- Please, I'm fine.

181
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:38,432
This is good. It's time you let go
of Julie DeMarco, just move past her.

182
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:42,146
So I've decided. You should
ask Julie DeMarco out for coffee.

183
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:45,793
She's one of the sweetest people
I have ever, ever known.

184
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:49,092
Yeah, Tom, did you see those legs?
Forget about it.

185
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,973
- You were staring at her legs?
- No, not for me, for Tom.

186
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,957
- I can't believe you.
- What?

187
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,877
You should be staring at my legs.

188
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,145
I've been staring
at your legs for nine years.

189
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:00,767
What are you saying?
You're tired of my legs?

190
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:02,692
No, Cynthia,
I'm agreeing with you.

191
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,798
I'm saying that Tom should ask
Julie DeMarco out for coffee.

192
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:06,974
- Don't you think he should?
- Yes!

193
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,707
Are you okay?

194
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,638
Please, I'm fine.

195
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,051
How was the party?

196
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,972
It was okay.

197
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:04,508
Gonna see your father on Sunday?

198
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,730
I don't know, Ma.

199
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,464
Anything new?

200
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,594
Good night, Ma.

201
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,139
See ya tomorrow.

202
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,903
Ohh.

203
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,569
Tom.

204
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:28,571
I got in touch
with Jimmy Gold.

205
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:34,425
He's coming down
from Boston.

206
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:38,272
And then the cousins
from Jersey.

207
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:43,672
Maybe, you know,
a friend from the gym.

208
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,496
We might be one or two short
on the pallbearers.

209
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,575
Mrs. Abernathy,
I am really sorry.

210
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,392
I wish there was something
I could do to help you out.

211
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,031
I know how you feel.

212
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:15,041
You do?

213
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,360
- I'm giving the eulogy.
- What?

214
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,555
- Ruth Abernathy came to my house.
- Jesus, you didn't get out of it?

215
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:25,242
- You're getting enmeshed.
- Are you having a thing?

216
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,826
Tom, don't get upset.
Brad and Lauren just stopped by.

217
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:31,067
- It's not like a thing thing.
- Is that lasagna?

218
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:37,793
- I can't believe you people.
It's just like a conspiracy.
- No, it's not!

219
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:41,053
- If you must know, this was my idea.
- Oh, your idea.

220
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:43,540
- We're two couples having dinner.
- I need to be a couple now.

221
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,944
- Not everything's about you, Tom.
- That's right. It's all about you...

222
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,626
and your sisters and all
your dietary restrictions.

223
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,550
All right, that's it!
I've had your shit...

224
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,558
- Let's go. I'm ready for you now.
- Relax.

225
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,803
- Get you a drink, Tom?
- Yes, you can, Cynthia.

226
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,938
- And some lasagna. Thank you.
- Take it easy.

227
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,505
I don't know.
What about the chess club? Can't
we do anything with the chess club?

228
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,430
It should be personal.
I mean, you loved the guy.

229
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,600
- I did not love the guy.
- Maybe you traveled together.

230
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,527
Yeah, excellent!
Scott, read that back.

231
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,664
Okay. "Chess. You loved him.
Traveled together."

232
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,704
- Okay. We are on our way.
- You traveled together playing chess.

233
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,749
- Yes! Yes!
- Through China.

234
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:21,501
You played chess in China
and then you fell in love.

235
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,420
See, that doesn't help.

236
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,935
You don't know this Ruth Abernathy
person. She means business.

237
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,105
- So, Scott, you're
coming with me, right?

238
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,280
- What, to the funeral? No.
- Scott!

239
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,271
How about giving
a little moral support?

240
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,189
- Yeah, Scott, I need some moral support.
- Don't worry.

241
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,775
- I'll support you, Tom.
- Just Scott.

242
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,300
- Hi. How are you?
- It's Julie DeMarco.

243
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:43,829
What, she just
comes over now?

244
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:48,539
Hi. I'm sorry I missed
the lasagna, but I got... Anyway.

245
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,251
Here are the magazines
we were talking about.

246
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,824
- So. What's going on?
- We're writing a eulogy.

247
00:18:56,926 --> 00:19:01,237
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry. We didn't know the guy.

248
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:04,441
You guys are going to someone's funeral
who you don't know?

249
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,648
- Actually, they're not going. I'm going.
- Scott and I are going.

250
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,580
- Why don't you come too?
- You're inviting me to a funeral?

251
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:12,760
- Yes!
It's not like it's a real funeral.

252
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,764
- It is! It's a funeral.
- If she's going, I'm allowed to go.

253
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,693
- She is not going.
- Typical bullshit.

254
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,678
- Tom!
- It's okay.

255
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:24,409
Obviously, Tom does not want me to go
to this funeral thing and that's fine.

256
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,155
- I have nothing against you
going personally...
- All right, we're all going.

257
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:30,742
No, no, no.
Only if it's okay with Tom.

258
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,845
- Tom, is it okay?
- Is it okay, Tom? Come on.

259
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:09,588
- That's the dead guy's mother?
- Uh-huh.

260
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,515
Jesus.

261
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:29,050
Thank you.

262
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,973
Excuse me. My condolences.
Who will perform the eulogy?

263
00:20:56,251 --> 00:21:00,145
The tall young man with
the dark suit and hair. Tom Thompson.

264
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:02,869
Thank you so much.

265
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,801
Ring any bells?

266
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:47,863
No.

267
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:54,867
Mr. Thompson,
if you would please, sir.

268
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,287
Good luck.

269
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,772
Who is Bill Abernathy?

270
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:30,453
This is not
an easy question to answer.

271
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:38,125
I could spend countless hours
recounting my personal experiences...

272
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,055
with Bill.

273
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:49,654
The chess club.

274
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,328
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

275
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:03,797
Instead I ask,

276
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:07,310
who is the real Bill Abernathy?

277
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:13,203
What is the single...

278
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:17,776
elusive, intangible,
inner quality...

279
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:19,734
that makes... made...

280
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,228
Bill...

281
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:28,781
Shh.

282
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,308
Bill.

283
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,148
Well, folks, I don't...

284
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,449
I don't have that answer.

285
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,850
Who really does?

286
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:06,353
Shh.

287
00:25:15,062 --> 00:25:16,883
Pull ahead.

288
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,699
- I got it.
- All right.

289
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,763
Here we go.

290
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:26,098
- So, you guys, I don't think
this is funny, all right?
- We don't think it's funny.

291
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:29,360
- We weren't laughing.
- Yes, you were.
I can't, you know...

292
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,396
- That was a sneeze.
- I don't think it's funny.
I just don't understand.

293
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,801
We weren't laughing.

294
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:39,853
I'll see you all later.

295
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:43,218
I don't feel like staying.
I'm very... I'm gonna go.

296
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:50,256
Julie! Julie!

297
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,909
- Ohh!
- Come right this way, please.

298
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,326
- Julie! Where are you goin'?
- Come on, I'm losing him!
What are you doing?

299
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,345
- Julie!
- Come on! Hey, hey, wait!

300
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:01,615
Where... Where are you going?

301
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:03,952
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going?

302
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:07,368
- I'm leaving. This isn't funny.
- I know. I felt terrible.

303
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,298
So, you remember him?

304
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,981
- What?
- I saw you in the chapel.
You were crying.

305
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,906
Hey, buddy,
are you kidding with this?

306
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:17,069
Do you mind?
We're about to bury this guy.

307
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:20,170
This is a person.
This is a person's life.

308
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,169
I don't remember him.

309
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:27,472
- Oh.
- Hey, what's goin' on over there?

310
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,221
It was just so, so sad.

311
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,941
I don't know what the hell he's doing.

312
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:34,864
- Do you wanna get some coffee?
- Unbelievable.

313
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,784
- He's pickin' up chicks.
- Coffee?

314
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:39,948
Yeah. If you wouldn't mind.

315
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,602
- Yeah, all right.
Why don't you call me?
- C-Call you?

316
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:45,096
- Get him off.
- All right, let's go.

317
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,228
- Whoa!
- All right, all right.
Come on, back it up.

318
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:57,481
I never should've asked you
to be a pallbearer.

319
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:59,691
It was too much for you.

320
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:02,577
- There's a will.
- What?

321
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:04,910
You're in the will.

322
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,503
All the way in.

323
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:30,062
Hello?

324
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:31,983
- Julie, hi.
- Hi.

325
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,733
- Hi, it's Tom Thompson.
- Oh. Tom.

326
00:27:34,832 --> 00:27:36,458
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm fine.

327
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:41,134
So listen, um, I was calling
because we've talked about din... um...

328
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:43,053
- Uh...
- What did we talk about?

329
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:47,822
- Did we, at the funeral,
talk about doing this, uh...
- Right, right.

330
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,189
- The coffee thing.
- Yes!

331
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:52,590
- Um, listen, I was thinking...
- Yeah?

332
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:55,056
What if Scott and Cynthia come along?

333
00:27:55,152 --> 00:27:57,607
- Scott and Cynthia?
- Yeah.

334
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:02,502
- Oh, you mean like a, uh...
- Yeah, you know, like the four of us.

335
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:05,772
- Tom!
- 'Cause I'm seeing Cynthia
on Tuesday anyway.

336
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:08,109
- Tu... On Tuesday?
- Tom!

337
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,281
- Who was that?
- Huh? Oh, it's, uh... it's ju...

338
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:13,930
- This crazy woman...
Jesus, this neighborhood is...

339
00:28:14,032 --> 00:28:17,194
Hey, lady, you wanna keep it down?
I am on the phone here!

340
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,558
Are you on the phone?
- Hello.

341
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:22,957
- Hello?
- Hello?

342
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:25,609
Who is this? Hello?

343
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,533
Jesus.

344
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:29,453
Tom?

345
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:31,820
Oh, my God. Tom?

346
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,926
Uh, hel...

347
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,846
...Ulie?
- H-Hello?

348
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:38,798
- Julie? Julie?
- Hi! Hi!

349
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,197
Wh... Well, that was weir...
What was that?

350
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:44,077
lt... Did...
D- Did you... That was really creepy.

351
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:47,523
- She just kept saying "hello."
Did you hear her?
- No. Didn't you hear me?

352
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:50,412
- Y... No.
- No? I w... Well, I was calling you.

353
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,365
Were you trying to contact me?

354
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:54,286
Uh, y-y-yeah.

355
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,685
I ke... I kept saying "Julie."

356
00:28:56,782 --> 00:29:00,197
Didn't... It must've been
a weird party line thing.

357
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:02,126
- That has never happened before.
- Huh.

358
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:04,460
So listen,
Tuesday is bowling night.

359
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:06,925
- Oh.
- Uh, how about Thursday?

360
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:08,910
Great.

361
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,332
Oh, no,
I- I can't take his car.

362
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,253
Look at this mess.

363
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,171
Mrs. Abernathy.

364
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,467
- Take it. He wanted you to have it.
- No, really, I can't.

365
00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:32,359
I gotta get it out of here.
Please.

366
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:37,637
Twenty-five-year-old kid
makes out a will.

367
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,043
I should've known right then.

368
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:43,883
I brought you some, uh...
nut clusters.

369
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,851
They're my favorite.

370
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:51,336
Oh, Tom.

371
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:53,738
I'm sorry about the funeral.

372
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:55,660
So...

373
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,212
how are you doing?

374
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,138
I'm fine, I'm...

375
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,892
I'm gonna be.
Thank you.

376
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:12,459
Maybe I should just
have them take it all away.

377
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,339
- Oh, here, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.

378
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:18,698
I gotta get it all out of here
if I'm gonna sell this place.

379
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,618
Oh, you're gonna
sell the house?

380
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:23,816
Yeah. You know, maybe
it's too big for one person.

381
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,739
Too quiet.

382
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:29,066
I mean, it's like I have
the TV on all the time now.

383
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:32,263
Thank you. It's very nice to have
someone to help out around here.

384
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,186
Oh, sure.

385
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:41,893
Who knows? You know,
I was thinking, maybe, of going
to one of those computer schools.

386
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:44,680
Oh, yeah, computers.
That's good.

387
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,601
You think so?

388
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:52,906
I'm gonna have to go through
Bill's stuff in his room.

389
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:58,313
- I wish I could help you out.
- Oh, no, no.

390
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,713
I mean, it's just that
I'm... I'm very busy.

391
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:04,072
- I mean, I got a job interview.
- Oh, a job interview.

392
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:06,627
Yeah. Actually it's a second interview.

393
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,554
I bet you get it.

394
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,473
Thank you.

395
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,840
I hope so.
I'm a little worried.

396
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,524
Do you mind if
I make a suggestion?

397
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,792
- Sure.
- Why don't you try pushing
your hair back over your forehead.

398
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,674
You know, like the other afternoon.
Like... Yeah, like that.

399
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,593
Just...

400
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:29,224
You don't let 'em see your face.
You're a good-looking man.

401
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:34,441
Well, maybe I'll let you
know how the interview goes.

402
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,360
I mean, if you're interested.

403
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:40,288
- Sure. If you have enough time,
you can drop by.
- Yeah, if I have the time.

404
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:01,125
- Whoa! My God, look at you.
- He's turned a corner.

405
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:04,641
Oh, very important. I sort of mentioned
that I live on my own, okay?

406
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:07,528
- So just don't blow it.
- You lied to her?

407
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,440
- No, she seemed to have
a thing about it.
- So what are we supposed to say?

408
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:13,320
- Oh, this is it!
- What are we supposed to do at the end?

409
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:16,198
- Cynthia and I are going for cocktails?
- A late movie.

410
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:20,552
- You guys say you have plans
to see a late movie, then just go.
- How are we getting home?

411
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,951
Deal with it.
I need the car.

412
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,832
He's gotta drive her home.
That's the whole point.

413
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,711
Could you give me an opening for
the story about Brad and the oranges?

414
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:30,784
- Tom, just be yourself.
- Yeah, you're right.

415
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,053
- Scott, you set me up
with the orange story.
- You got it.

416
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:43,710
Wait, wait, wait.
Wh... What was it?

417
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:45,639
- Uh, "Mean To Me," maybe?
- No, no!

418
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:49,511
- Louis Armstrong did
a great versión of it too.
- Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Uh...

419
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:51,681
It goes:
# Dah dah-dah dah-dah #

420
00:32:51,785 --> 00:32:54,403
# Dah dah-dah dah-dah
Dah dah-dah dah-dah #

421
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:57,919
- # Dah dah-dah dah-dah... #
- # If I only had a brain #

422
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,500
Tom, you've heard of
Django Reinhardt, right?

423
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,389
- No, Scott.
- Oh, my God. He is so amazing.

424
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:09,318
- He only had three fingers.
- Really?

425
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,238
- Yeah.
- Mmm. That's too bad.

426
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:14,566
So, anyway...

427
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:17,445
Julie, did you know Tom's
got a second interview tomorrow?

428
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,366
Oh! That's great.

429
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,406
- Yeah, well...
- "I Surrender, Dear."

430
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:25,157
- You what, honey?
- # Dah-dah, dah-dah #

431
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:26,816
# Dah-dah, dah-dah #

432
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,408
# I surrender, dear ##

433
00:33:29,512 --> 00:33:31,398
I love that song.

434
00:33:31,495 --> 00:33:35,522
Oh, you know what? I think that's
on Decca. I've seen it in the bins.

435
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:38,079
- What, you have that record?
- Yeah.

436
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,972
I need that record desperately!

437
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,584
- Yeah, so they seemed
to really like my portfolio.
- What?

438
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,988
Oh, 'cause... Oh!
That's so exciting, Tom.

439
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:49,283
- Yeah, you should really see
Tom's stuff. It's so great.
- Oh, go on.

440
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:52,645
Well, it's a really good firm
and they seem to have room to grow.

441
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:55,525
And you can maybe finally
move out of your mom's house.

442
00:33:57,895 --> 00:34:01,890
Didn't you have... What was that,
that story about Brad and oranges?

443
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:05,504
Didn't you have a story
about Brad and oranges?

444
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:07,429
No, Scott.

445
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:11,429
Whoa, Cynthia and I
have to, uh...

446
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,309
we have to go get
some cocktails.

447
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:16,447
Mmm.

448
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,834
I- I-I cannot believe you.

449
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,237
I'm sorry. That thing about
your mother just slipped out.

450
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,635
No, the whole evening.
What were those topics?

451
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:30,622
- You were supposed to feed me openings
so I could jump in with the zingers.
- I was.

452
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:33,027
- You weren't zinging.
- Oh, bullshit!

453
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:37,086
- How am I supposed to zing
on, what, "jingle-jangle"?
- Django Reinhardt!

454
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,452
Look, I'm sorry. She told me
she was working in this record store.

455
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,331
- You told me to keep things flowing.
- Oh, flowing. Yes, flo...

456
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,731
You know,
you're making me sick, Scott.

457
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:48,612
- You still have the drive home.
- The drive home?

458
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,165
The drive home is useless, you know.

459
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

460
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:55,012
- Hi.
- Hi.

461
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:11,971
You know, we really didn't get
much of a chance to talk tonight.

462
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,650
I wanted to tell you something.

463
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,450
I remember you.

464
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:28,989
We shared a music stand,
didn't we?

465
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:33,372
Yeah.

466
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:37,218
I used to talk to you
about that guy I went out with... Kenny.

467
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:40,322
That's right.

468
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,055
Anyway...

469
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,186
What I remember is...

470
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,186
you were a really nice guy.

471
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,714
Julie.

472
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,949
- Oww! Oh, shit.
- Ooh!

473
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:08,026
I am so... Ohh. Okay.

474
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,912
- Oh, my God.
- I should've warned you I was going in.

475
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:12,834
- Oh, God.
- Are... Are you...

476
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,714
No, you know, it's my fault.
I just... I do this, you know.

477
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:18,593
L... I give out
the wrong signals.

478
00:36:18,691 --> 00:36:20,514
Oh.

479
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:27,513
L...

480
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:32,317
I'm re... I'm really sorry, Tom.

481
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:40,288
I'm going away.

482
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:42,972
You're going away?

483
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,336
- It's sort of a... sort of a long story.
- But you just moved back.

484
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,257
Well, I'm not really here.

485
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:52,894
It's, like, a temporary arrangement
until I'm ready to go.

486
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:57,916
I needed a place to stay and my dad,
you know, owns the building and I just...

487
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:04,825
I mean, if I wasn't going away...

488
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,085
Well, I'm very sorry.

489
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:27,487
I mean, your work is very strong.

490
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:29,407
I fought for you.

491
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:32,287
But the partners felt,
and I had to agree with them,

492
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:35,799
you just don't fulfill
our needs at this time.

493
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:38,688
I want to thank you
for coming in.

494
00:37:42,913 --> 00:37:44,953
I didn't get the job.

495
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,798
I'll get the boxes.

496
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,533
He loved the Mets.

497
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:57,299
Thank you for doing this.

498
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:07,933
I got something you might want.

499
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,960
Come here.

500
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:34,204
There might be
one or two of you in there.

501
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,123
You can take one.

502
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:53,853
It's hard to believe.

503
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:07,800
- You're a beautiful boy.
- Oh, no, no.

504
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,315
- Yes, you are.
- Well, thank you, Ruth. Thank you.

505
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,800
Bill Senior, on the other hand,

506
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,355
he had to get by on his wits.

507
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:28,280
No chin.

508
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:36,243
I met him one night at this party
at Aunt Lucille's.

509
00:41:36,347 --> 00:41:40,209
I was 16.
I fell for him like that.

510
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,835
Next day he left for Vietnam.

511
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,761
Two years.

512
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:49,591
So... what, you just
waited for him?

513
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,991
Oh, sure.

514
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,668
- I mean, there were
plenty of other suitors.
- I'm sure.

515
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:03,888
But Bill Senior, you know,
he just... tickled my fancy.

516
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:06,449
Whew, and those letters he wrote.

517
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,658
Holy cow.

518
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:13,140
I would've waited a few lifetimes.

519
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:15,064
You know what I mean?

520
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,623
Yeah.

521
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:26,904
It's that easy.

522
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:30,262
I had the dial set a little thin.
- Press the button.

523
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,143
And now you'll feed
everything down to the last piece.

524
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:35,063
It's a perfect result!

525
00:42:35,162 --> 00:42:36,884
- That's pretty good!
- Every time.

526
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:39,768
- It's beautiful.
- It's perfection in slicing.

527
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:53,429
- Please, Tom.
- Ruth, I'd really rather not.

528
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,831
I need you to do this.

529
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:59,190
He never talked to me
about things like this.

530
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:01,591
It's... It's important to me.
Please.

531
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,271
What do you want to know?

532
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,470
Giris.

533
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:15,600
Well, I think
there was one girl Bill liked.

534
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:17,526
Really?

535
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,381
What was her name?

536
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:28,533
- Julie.
- Julie.

537
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,391
- Was she pretty?
- Oh, yeah.

538
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:39,917
He did everything he could, but he just
couldn't stop thinking about her.

539
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:46,413
Even when he tried
really hard not to.

540
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,825
She haunted him.

541
00:43:51,926 --> 00:43:54,709
She haunted him.

542
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,628
So what happened?

543
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:00,981
Well, she told him
she was planning on going away,

544
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:02,901
but I don't know.

545
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:11,764
He couldn't let her go.

546
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:27,348
I mean, he'd been in love
with her for so long.

547
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:44,019
And I guess no one tickled
his fancy the way she did.

548
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,141
So, this Julie...

549
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:54,797
Do you think
that's the reason he...

550
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:58,927
No, Ruth. I knew we shouldn't
have gotten into this.

551
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,325
- Could be the reason, you know.
- Ruth, no.

552
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,242
- Did she go to Yale?
- What?

553
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:07,123
There were all these
toll receipts in the car.
New Haven. Did she go to Yale?

554
00:45:07,222 --> 00:45:09,293
She didn't go to Y...
No, Ru... It...

555
00:45:09,397 --> 00:45:14,218
I don't think it had anything
to do with her. I know it didn't.

556
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:23,952
Hello?

557
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,872
Tom? It's Julie.

558
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,791
Hi, Julie...

559
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:31,948
- Julie?
- Can I come over?
I have to talk to you.

560
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,304
- Come over here?
- Yeah. I'm in the neighborhood.
I'm coming, okay?

561
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:43,183
- What are you doing?
- Someone's coming over. A girl.

562
00:47:43,282 --> 00:47:46,412
Don't make a big deal...
Is that what you're wearing?

563
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:48,455
It's my friggin' house!

564
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:51,343
Okay, try not to say "friggin',"
don't call me "Tom-Tom"...

565
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:53,742
and no stories about me doing magic.

566
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,175
- Hey.
- Hi.

567
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:02,989
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

568
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,501
- So, could I come in, or...
- Oh, sure.

569
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,694
- Julie, this is my mom.
- Oh, hi.

570
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,898
I'm Tom's mom.

571
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,973
How are you?

572
00:48:28,399 --> 00:48:32,459
Tom-Tom comes out
in his funny little hat and cape...

573
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:35,014
and he has a little magic wand.

574
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:39,014
I'm telling you,
he was the cutest thing you ever saw!

575
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,094
- I got a picture.
- Mom, no pictures.

576
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,982
- Oh, wait, no! I got one in...
- Mom!

577
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,294
I'm goin' in the kitchen now.

578
00:48:48,399 --> 00:48:50,221
Oy.

579
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,140
It was really nice meeting you.

580
00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:54,061
Oh, it was nice meeting you too.

581
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,677
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

582
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:05,517
It's just, this thing happened
and I didn't know who else to turn to.

583
00:49:05,616 --> 00:49:08,484
Well, what's...
what's up?

584
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,624
Scott came to see me
last night.

585
00:49:11,727 --> 00:49:13,548
He did?
What, at work?

586
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:15,304
- Yeah.
- How is Scott?

587
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:20,487
He made a pass at me.

588
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:23,373
Oh, my... Wh...
I can't believe he did this!

589
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,291
What in... What...
I can't believe it!

590
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:28,619
How could he kiss you like that
when he's supposed to be married?

591
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:31,499
- How do you know he kissed me?
- How do l... How's that?

592
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:34,379
I said "pass,"
I didn't say "kiss."

593
00:49:34,478 --> 00:49:37,260
- Oh, my God! Did he tell you this?
- No. I'm sorry.

594
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:40,140
- I hear "pass," I move right to "kiss."
- Well, he did kiss me.

595
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:42,244
Bastard!
What is he thinking?

596
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:46,147
I don't know what to do.
Do I tell Cynthia? Do I not tell her?

597
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:49,036
Oh, you... you... you tell her.
This is a moral issue.

598
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:53,126
Unfortunately, Scott is an adulterer and
that is something Cynthia should know.

599
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:56,076
Okay, okay, but what if
it's not all Scott's fault, all right?

600
00:49:56,174 --> 00:49:58,955
- What if it's partly my fault?
- What do you mean?

601
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:02,314
I'm just saying, he shows up
out of nowhere looking for a record?

602
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:05,992
I should've seen it coming. I just...
I let things get out of control.

603
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:08,582
- The same thing happened with Jed.
- Jed?

604
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:11,468
One minute we're having
this casual conversation...
"Maybe we should live together."

605
00:50:11,564 --> 00:50:13,451
The next thing I know,
I'm getting married.

606
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:15,850
- This is the guy you were gonna marry.
- Yeah.

607
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:19,266
I mean, I cared about him, you know,
and he really wanted to get married.

608
00:50:19,373 --> 00:50:22,820
But I guess I wasn't sure,
and I should've told him
that at the very beginning.

609
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:25,893
I mean, before that whole
marriage thing got started.

610
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:33,258
Have you ever not told someone something
that you should've told them,

611
00:50:33,356 --> 00:50:35,658
but you were afraid to,
so you didn't,

612
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:38,539
and then it turned into
a whole complicated thing...

613
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,539
that you never should've
gotten into in the first place?

614
00:50:43,788 --> 00:50:45,730
You kids want some Bosco?

615
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,527
Mom! No!

616
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,759
Oh. I love Bosco.

617
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:55,626
This is why you
never got first chair.

618
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:57,545
- What?
- In band.

619
00:50:57,644 --> 00:51:01,386
Mr. Busto wanted you to challenge
Cliff Young for first chair,

620
00:51:01,483 --> 00:51:03,305
but you wouldn't do it.

621
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:05,226
Oh, my God.

622
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:08,585
- I forgot about Cliff Young.
- You didn't want to hurt his feelings.

623
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:11,978
- Well, he loved his solos.
- Yeah, but you were better than he was.

624
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:13,897
- No.
- You were.

625
00:51:13,996 --> 00:51:16,298
I'll, I'll give
Cliff Young his trills,

626
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:19,177
but you had it all over him
in the upper register.

627
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:21,577
How do you remember
all this?

628
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:24,163
I have a really good memory.

629
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:26,570
Well,

630
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:28,642
I guess I was always screwed up.

631
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:34,665
No, you were just worried
about other people's feelings.

632
00:51:34,763 --> 00:51:38,505
Yeah, but the thing is,
you spend your life worrying
about how other people feel,

633
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:42,018
you sort of lose track,
you know, of how you feel.

634
00:51:43,563 --> 00:51:47,425
Does this have anything
to do with you going away?

635
00:51:47,531 --> 00:51:49,287
Sort of.

636
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:52,649
My plan...

637
00:51:52,746 --> 00:51:56,041
is to save up, buy a car,

638
00:51:56,139 --> 00:51:58,920
pack all the things
I really care about...

639
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:02,280
and just drive off on my own
for, like, a year.

640
00:52:02,377 --> 00:52:05,377
Because I never really
been on my own. You know?

641
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:18,373
Y- You've got a thing.

642
00:52:18,474 --> 00:52:20,296
On my mouth?

643
00:52:39,498 --> 00:52:41,320
Listen, um,

644
00:52:42,857 --> 00:52:46,053
there's this thing tonight
at St. John the Divine.

645
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:49,895
I got the tickets for me
and, you know, Jed.

646
00:52:51,687 --> 00:52:54,470
- It's this guy Gorczcki.
- Hockey?

647
00:52:54,568 --> 00:52:56,392
A composer.

648
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:58,310
I know.

649
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,903
So, uh,

650
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:10,182
do you, you know...
do you want to go with me?

651
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,103
Yes.

652
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:29,702
- How could you do this to me?
- What?

653
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,101
It's 2:30.
Where the hell have you been?

654
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,942
- I really need to talk to you.
Can we please just go inside?
- They're waiting for us.

655
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,822
- Who?
- Weren't you even listening
to me the other night?

656
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:41,702
Of course I was listening to you.
What did you say?

657
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,028
Aunt Lucille's.
The pool party.

658
00:53:45,128 --> 00:53:48,063
Did you even remember
to bring your trunks?

659
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:51,428
Oh, Jesus. Let's go.
I packed some of Bill's.

660
00:53:54,182 --> 00:53:56,005
Come on!

661
00:53:56,103 --> 00:53:58,655
# Papa loves mambo #

662
00:53:59,942 --> 00:54:02,878
# Mama loves mambo #

663
00:54:02,983 --> 00:54:05,567
# Look at him sway with it
Gettin' so gay with it #

664
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:07,809
- # Shoutin' "ole" with it now #
- Hey!

665
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,983
# Papa loves mambo #

666
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:11,910
Ohh!

667
00:54:12,007 --> 00:54:14,626
Do you remember me?

668
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:17,726
- Uh...
- Of course you don't.
You were this high.

669
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,026
Boys, you remember Tom
from the funeral?

670
00:54:22,151 --> 00:54:25,086
Ruth told me everything
you've been doing.

671
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,012
She did?

672
00:54:27,111 --> 00:54:29,892
I can't tell you
how wonderful you are,

673
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:32,576
helping my sister-in-law
through this time.

674
00:54:32,677 --> 00:54:35,329
Oh, there she is.

675
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:38,495
Ohh! Oh, you look great!

676
00:54:39,622 --> 00:54:41,445
You're making me cry.

677
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:43,843
- Oh, well...
- You are so strong.

678
00:54:43,942 --> 00:54:47,685
I owe it all to Tom.
I mean, he was there for me, you know.

679
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:51,578
- When I needed someone, he was there.
- Tom.

680
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:53,508
# Feelin' that zing again, wow #

681
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:55,841
- # Papa loves mambo #
- # Papa loves mambo #

682
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,884
# Mama loves mambo ##

683
00:54:57,988 --> 00:55:02,179
Julie, hi.
It's, it's me, Tom.

684
00:55:02,277 --> 00:55:04,100
No, everything's fine.

685
00:55:04,198 --> 00:55:07,744
Listen, what time did you
say the concert was?

686
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:09,885
No, I can make it, um...

687
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,884
It's just, I had this horrible
family thing I couldn't get out of.

688
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,983
Okay, great.

689
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:26,457
No, I'm still here.

690
00:55:26,565 --> 00:55:28,801
Okay.

691
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,276
Bye.

692
00:55:42,532 --> 00:55:45,281
# Come a little bit closer #

693
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:49,541
- # Hear what I have to say #
- So, did you like it?

694
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,457
It was great.

695
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:56,192
- It was nothing like anything
we ever played in band though.

696
00:55:58,276 --> 00:56:00,513
Weren't all these recalled?

697
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:04,059
No. That was the, uh, Pinto.

698
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:06,947
- I don't think we're gonna make it.
- Are you kidding me?

699
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:09,695
This... This thing's
running like a top.

700
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:17,921
- # Oooh #
- # But there's a full moon risin' #

701
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,183
I'm sure
it just needs a minor adjustment.

702
00:56:23,364 --> 00:56:24,989
Tom?

703
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:26,652
- Hmm?
- Who's Ruth?

704
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,943
Ruth?

705
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:35,038
You know, Ruth.
Under the seat, I found "Ruth."

706
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,946
Oh, that's Ruth Abernathy's.
Bill's mom.

707
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:41,824
I've been sort of
spending some time with her.

708
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:45,370
You know, she's been going
through a, a difficult period.

709
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:48,641
Are you kidding me?

710
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:51,423
What do you mean?

711
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:54,969
That is so nice of you.

712
00:56:56,419 --> 00:56:58,874
Oh. No, i-it really isn't.

713
00:56:58,979 --> 00:57:01,762
Yes, it is.
You don't even remember that guy.

714
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:04,160
That is so nice of you.

715
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:07,040
No, it... it really isn't.

716
00:57:13,698 --> 00:57:18,520
# Because I'm still
in love with you #

717
00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:22,367
# I wanna see you
dance again #

718
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:27,070
# Because I'm still
in love with you #

719
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:32,734
# On this harvest moon ##

720
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:45,823
- That's your room?
- What?

721
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:49,343
Yeah. I tried to
get that off.

722
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:51,263
It's, like, welded
to the door.

723
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:54,718
Can I see?

724
00:57:54,816 --> 00:57:58,559
Um, my mom doesn't really
like me to drive her car.

725
00:57:58,657 --> 00:58:00,795
We really shouldn't dally.

726
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:04,475
W- We're getting into
a dangerous zone here.

727
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,650
You wait here, okay?

728
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:32,478
Oh, shit.

729
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,175
- Oh, Julie. Julie...
- Oh, my God.

730
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:41,271
- I know. I should probably
get rid of the bunk bed, huh?

731
00:58:41,376 --> 00:58:43,198
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Shh!

732
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,845
Ohh.

733
00:58:46,943 --> 00:58:49,659
- Do you still play?
- Not really? Do you?

734
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,799
No. I lost mine.

735
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,911
Oh.

736
00:58:54,016 --> 00:58:56,797
- I remember these.
- Yeah.

737
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:01,853
Shh!

738
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,774
Oh! Sorry.

739
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:05,693
These were great.

740
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,929
What happened to these?

741
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,813
They, they killed
a lot of people.

742
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:24,408
Um, I was cleaning out my closet...
that's why that's out.

743
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:34,743
- Oh, my God.
- What?

744
00:59:34,846 --> 00:59:37,497
My hair.
I look so bizarre.

745
00:59:37,597 --> 00:59:39,420
No. No, you didn't.

746
00:59:39,518 --> 00:59:42,300
Look at that dress.
What was I thinking?

747
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,012
You look beautiful.

748
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,814
For the last seven years
I've been wishing I'd danced with you.

749
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:52,731
What?

750
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:55,929
Oh, uh, it was the...
homecoming dance.

751
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:02,232
- You and me, we went to a dance?
- Oh, not together.

752
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,595
But it was during one of those weeks
that you and Kenny were broken up.

753
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:07,516
We were talking
on the bleachers...

754
01:00:07,614 --> 01:00:09,434
and "Rock Lobster"
started playing...

755
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,834
and you said
"I love this song,"

756
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,999
which I kinda took as a signal...

757
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:17,883
that you wanted to dance.

758
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:20,282
But...

759
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:22,203
I didn't ask you.

760
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:26,203
- Why not?
- 'Cause I can't dance.

761
01:00:31,772 --> 01:00:33,594
- Tom.
- What?

762
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:36,915
- I'm goin' in.
- You're...

763
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:55,226
Hi.

764
01:01:01,052 --> 01:01:02,875
- Oww.
- Oh. Oh.

765
01:01:02,973 --> 01:01:04,793
Oh!

766
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:08,698
Hello?

767
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:11,576
So, how was the concert?

768
01:01:11,675 --> 01:01:15,417
- Hey. Hey, Ruth.
- Is there something you
want to tell me, Tom?

769
01:01:15,514 --> 01:01:18,298
- Hello?
- Mom, I'm on the phone here.

770
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:20,217
- Who's calling so late?
- Mom, please.

771
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:22,137
Well, is somebody
in there with you?

772
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:25,050
I heard somebody come in with you.
Is there a girl in there?

773
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,930
- Mom, I am on the phone!
- Jesus.

774
01:01:29,948 --> 01:01:31,768
Are you still there?

775
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:34,169
I'm here.

776
01:01:39,227 --> 01:01:41,168
I- I found your bracelet.

777
01:01:43,643 --> 01:01:46,426
Is she there?

778
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:49,305
She's there, isn't she?

779
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:51,705
Are you gonna screw me, Tom?

780
01:01:52,954 --> 01:01:55,255
Are you gonna screw me over?

781
01:01:57,497 --> 01:01:59,321
You are, aren't you?

782
01:02:00,538 --> 01:02:02,360
You're gonna screw me over.

783
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:06,998
You did what?

784
01:02:07,354 --> 01:02:09,044
Don't make a big deal out of this.

785
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:12,855
You had sex with the dead guy's mother?
That lady from the funeral?

786
01:02:12,954 --> 01:02:16,217
- The lady from the funeral.
All right, Brad?
- Did you tell Scott?

787
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:18,615
- I'm not talking to Scott.
- What do you mean?

788
01:02:18,713 --> 01:02:20,853
- Scott's an asshole.
- What are you talkin' about?

789
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:24,467
- Brad!
- What's going on here?
Who are you these days?

790
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:27,952
- The point is, what am I gonna
do about Ruth Abernathy?
- What are you gonna do?

791
01:02:28,057 --> 01:02:30,840
- You're gonna get out of there.
What are you, nuts?
- This is no good.

792
01:02:30,938 --> 01:02:34,135
- Brad!
- Okay. Okay. We have to wrap this up.

793
01:02:34,232 --> 01:02:36,753
Wrap it up?
We're nowhere, okay?

794
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:39,573
I'm in a dilemma, Brad. Look.

795
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,928
- What's that?
- That's her charm bracelet.

796
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,197
- The dead guy's mother?
- Ruth Abernathy.

797
01:02:46,297 --> 01:02:48,534
- Her name is Ruth.
- Okay. Okay.

798
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:52,244
Take that friggin' bracelet and
drop it in the mail. You understand?

799
01:02:52,346 --> 01:02:55,508
Write her a little love poem
and get rid of it, 'cause you're lost.

800
01:02:55,607 --> 01:02:59,286
What are you saying? Just drop it
in the mail? That's your big solution?

801
01:02:59,386 --> 01:03:02,167
- Get in here, Brad!
- Okay!

802
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:05,462
- I gotta go. That's three calls.
I gotta go.
- Brad...

803
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,342
Listen, that's all I got,
all right?

804
01:03:08,439 --> 01:03:10,643
Mail it. Clean break.

805
01:03:10,744 --> 01:03:12,501
Tom.

806
01:03:14,264 --> 01:03:18,606
Look, it's good about you and Julie.
Don't worry about it.

807
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:22,358
Thanks, Brad.

808
01:03:59,288 --> 01:04:01,360
It's my birthday.

809
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:05,620
I'm having brunch with
my parents on Sunday to celebrate.

810
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,541
That'll be nice.

811
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,395
Mmm.

812
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:14,003
It'll be the first time
I've seen them since I left Jed.

813
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:16,885
Mmm.

814
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,204
Would you go with me?

815
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:26,321
To meet your parents?

816
01:04:26,422 --> 01:04:28,724
Yeah.

817
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:31,603
You want me
to meet your parents?

818
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,741
Yeah.

819
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:40,308
Is $15 enough?

820
01:04:40,407 --> 01:04:44,334
Ma, the name of this place is
Chanterelle. That's $50 right there.

821
01:04:44,438 --> 01:04:46,260
I'll get you another $5.

822
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:14,548
Tom?

823
01:05:14,646 --> 01:05:17,011
Is that for you, Tom?

824
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:32,651
- Hello.
- Is Tom here?

825
01:05:32,756 --> 01:05:35,855
Can you tell me
what this is regarding?

826
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:14,354
You know where he went?

827
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,320
Say something.

828
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:20,178
- Honey, could we just eat
first before we...
- Tom.

829
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,099
- Hi.
- Hi.

830
01:06:22,196 --> 01:06:24,017
Hello.

831
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:26,254
Hi.

832
01:06:26,355 --> 01:06:28,178
Tom, this is
my father Philip.

833
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,993
- It's really great to meet you, sir.
- I don't understand.

834
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:32,913
- And, uh,
- Excuse me, sir.

835
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,832
This is my mom Suzanne.

836
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:37,714
- Oh. Good morning.
- Hello. Are you eating here too?

837
01:06:37,811 --> 01:06:40,593
Yes, Tom... Tom, uh,
is going to be joining us.

838
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:43,473
- I thought we were here to talk.
- Please, honey, don't get upset.

839
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,392
- I am upset.
- Oh. Um...

840
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,491
Uh, look, look.
This is my birthday, okay?

841
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:50,415
Tom is my guest.

842
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:52,686
All right? Okay?

843
01:06:57,843 --> 01:06:59,817
I'm sorry. This is rude.

844
01:06:59,922 --> 01:07:02,791
I just don't understand.
Could you tell me what he's doing here?

845
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:05,484
My daughter walks out
just before her wedding.

846
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,815
I've barely heard from her in two
months. I want to know what's going on.

847
01:07:08,913 --> 01:07:10,737
- Well, that's understandable.
- Why is he talking?

848
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:13,997
- Are you sleeping with her?
Is that what this is?
- Dad!

849
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:17,611
- Philip.
- All right, I'll get to the point.

850
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:20,615
This trip...
we've all talked about it,

851
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:24,715
your mother and I and Grandma, and
we all agree... we don't understand it.

852
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:28,233
Sweetheart, listen,
a little vacation is a great idea.

853
01:07:28,338 --> 01:07:31,403
Why would you want to waste
a year of your life?

854
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:34,288
Look, I don't want
a vacation, all right?

855
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,447
I'm...

856
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:45,552
I'm lost, okay?

857
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,951
I'm completely... lost.

858
01:07:48,048 --> 01:07:51,790
I don't know what I'm doing with
my life, and I need to take this trip.

859
01:07:51,889 --> 01:07:53,710
It's important, okay?

860
01:07:56,945 --> 01:07:59,048
I mean, Tom understands, you know.

861
01:07:59,153 --> 01:08:03,211
I feel like he's the only person
who understands what I'm doing.

862
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:06,608
That's sort of the reason
I wanted him here.

863
01:08:06,705 --> 01:08:11,243
Tom, maybe
you could explain it to us.

864
01:08:21,104 --> 01:08:24,170
Well, Mrs. DeMarco, Mr. DeMarco,

865
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,641
um, I can understand...

866
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:33,005
how you might not want Julie
to go away right now.

867
01:08:35,408 --> 01:08:40,197
Uh, the truth is, it probably
has nothing to do with this trip.

868
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:45,420
It's probably because
you just don't want her to leave.

869
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,924
But... But I just think
that Julie feels...

870
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,133
Don't go, Julie.

871
01:08:57,231 --> 01:09:00,329
- What?
- I don't want you to go.
I mean, a year?

872
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:04,360
- I thought we were doing something here.
- Tom, what are you saying?

873
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:07,245
- I told you this was
a temporary thing. I said that.
- I know.

874
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:10,125
I've never felt like this
in my whole life, Julie.

875
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:14,216
I feel like we... I mean,
I feel like... I really know you.

876
01:09:16,655 --> 01:09:18,957
Don't you?
I mean, is it just me?

877
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:26,630
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- There you are!

878
01:09:26,735 --> 01:09:28,621
- Who is this?
- Oh, my God!

879
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,239
- Mrs. Abernathy?
- I wanna talk to you.

880
01:09:31,342 --> 01:09:33,285
- Ruth, this is not a good time.
- We're having a brunch here.

881
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:36,074
- We're going outside.
- This is the way you say good-bye?

882
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:38,442
- It was just for the sex, wasn't it?
- Jesus, Ruth.

883
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,356
- He's sleeping with everybody.
Have you been tested?
- What is she talking about?

884
01:09:41,454 --> 01:09:44,040
And what's this lousy poem? Is this
supposed to mean something to me?

885
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:46,925
- You wrote her a poem?
- No. Let's go.

886
01:09:47,022 --> 01:09:50,121
- Sex, sex, sex.
You're a horrible young man.

887
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:52,043
- Julie...
- Julie?

888
01:09:52,141 --> 01:09:53,965
- Oh, is this her?
- Yes.

889
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:56,134
- This is Julie, and we're going.
- Tell her, Tom.

890
01:09:56,237 --> 01:09:59,980
- Tell her what you did to
your best friend's mother!
- Oh, my God. Tom!

891
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:09,258
He wasn't my best friend.

892
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:17,036
- Julie.
- What are you talking about?

893
01:10:17,135 --> 01:10:19,207
- Julie.
- Tom!

894
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:24,299
Look, Ruth,
I don't even remember Bill.

895
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,578
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

896
01:11:13,547 --> 01:11:15,882
# She's a super freak
Super freak #

897
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,274
# She's super freaky
Yeow #

898
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:20,932
# Everybody sing #

899
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:22,978
# Super freak
Super freak #

900
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:27,840
# She's a very special girl #

901
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:30,249
- # From her head down to her tail #
- Hey! Hey!

902
01:11:30,347 --> 01:11:33,609
- How's about a little response?
Tommy, how ya doin'?

903
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:36,577
- Brad...
- Hey, nurse! Over here!
We got another patient!

904
01:11:36,682 --> 01:11:38,691
- No, no! Don't, Brad! Don't!
- This is...

905
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,143
This is my good friend Tommy. We need
to give him a little mouth-to-mouth.

906
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,513
- Stop kidding, all right?
- Hey, what's the matter, man?
It's my last Tuesday!

907
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:48,393
- I'm gettin' married!
I'm happy. I'm happy.
- I know! I am too!

908
01:11:48,489 --> 01:11:50,400
I'm just not in the mood, all right?

909
01:11:50,508 --> 01:11:54,118
I forgot.
You don't like bachelor parties.
You only get turned on at funerals.

910
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:57,569
- All right, very funny.
- Nurse, please! You talk to him.

911
01:11:57,676 --> 01:12:01,023
- No. I'm outta here. I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

912
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:03,203
- Brad, get off!
- # That girl's a super freak #

913
01:12:03,307 --> 01:12:06,121
- # I really like to taste her #
- # Every time we meet #

914
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:09,479
- Lauren is right about you.
- # She's all right, she's all right #

915
01:12:09,577 --> 01:12:11,814
- I defended you.
- # The girl's all right #

916
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:14,914
- # With me #
- I said you'd come through
in the end, but she's right.

917
01:12:15,018 --> 01:12:19,208
She told me not
to have you from the start.
She said Scott should be my best man.

918
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:23,230
- Scott? That's what she said? Scott?
- # She's a super freak #

919
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:26,120
- Yeah. 'Cause he's a better best man.
- # She's super freaky #

920
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,040
Don't marry her, Brad.

921
01:12:28,138 --> 01:12:29,994
- # Temptations, sing #
- Hey.

922
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:32,959
Lauren's an albatross
around your neck, Brad. Don't marry her.

923
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:35,848
- Tommy...
- And by the way, Scott thinks so too.

924
01:12:35,945 --> 01:12:39,491
# Whoa-ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh #

925
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:42,559
# She's a very kinky girl #

926
01:12:42,664 --> 01:12:45,447
# The kind you won't
take home to Mother #

927
01:12:45,544 --> 01:12:47,401
Bastard!

928
01:12:47,499 --> 01:12:49,571
Hey! Hey!

929
01:12:52,297 --> 01:12:55,559
Let him go.
Are you okay? Tom...

930
01:12:55,656 --> 01:12:58,690
- Get off me!
- Hey, asshole!

931
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:02,568
- Get out of my party! Get out of here!
- I saw you with her, Scott.

932
01:13:02,665 --> 01:13:05,446
No one wants you here! Get out!

933
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:08,195
Get off of me, Joey!

934
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:11,110
I don't want him here!
You're not allowed!

935
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:13,031
- What happened?
- Scott!

936
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:27,973
- Tom?
- Yeah, Mom?

937
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:29,895
Scott's here.

938
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:13,060
So, what are you doing in here?

939
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:20,324
New carburetor.
Just checking the idle.

940
01:14:25,671 --> 01:14:29,348
So, Brad's a little upset.

941
01:14:29,446 --> 01:14:31,267
Tried talking to him, but...

942
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,587
Doesn't look like
you're gonna be the best man.

943
01:14:35,686 --> 01:14:38,467
Well, you'd make a better best man
anyway, wouldn't you, Scott?

944
01:14:43,206 --> 01:14:45,028
Cynthia kicked me out.

945
01:14:48,421 --> 01:14:50,723
We had this little fight and it...

946
01:14:52,869 --> 01:14:55,652
I don't even know what it was about.

947
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:01,252
Look, Tom, I'm really sorry.

948
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:06,691
I messed up.

949
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,051
Tasha Cortina.

950
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:19,972
- Oh. Tasha Cortina.
- Yeah.

951
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:21,891
But she had that lip thing.

952
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:24,291
- What lip thing?
- You know, that little scar.

953
01:15:24,388 --> 01:15:27,170
- No, I liked that scar. It was sexy.
- For me, it ruined everything.

954
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:29,091
- Oh, you're too critical.
- Yeah.

955
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:31,490
- Boys?
- Ma! We're talk...

956
01:15:31,588 --> 01:15:34,371
I can't believe
you just walk in here.

957
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,665
I'm 25 years old.
This is why I need the lock.

958
01:15:37,764 --> 01:15:41,026
- I just wanted to know
if you want some ice cream.
- A little.

959
01:15:48,612 --> 01:15:51,264
Seventh grade. Nancy Weinberg.

960
01:15:51,364 --> 01:15:53,185
Oh, she liked me.

961
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:55,105
- She did not like you.
- She did.

962
01:15:55,205 --> 01:15:57,986
She had this very serious thing,
like an obsessión.

963
01:15:58,085 --> 01:16:00,155
No, don't you remember
Angela Mineri?

964
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,576
Angela Mineri told you Nancy Weinberg
had this big crush on you.

965
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:06,466
- You went up to Nancy
in front of everybody...
- Oh, no. Shit.

966
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:09,052
- And she laughed in your face.
- Yeah, that's right.

967
01:16:09,156 --> 01:16:12,416
- It was the other Tom.
She had a crush on him.
- What other Tom?

968
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:14,339
The other Tom.

969
01:16:15,587 --> 01:16:17,409
Wait, what are you saying?

970
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,960
- Oh, Jesus.
- Mr. Jellison's class.

971
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:23,842
- In eighth grade.
- He got a 58 in unit one algebra...

972
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:25,762
and then he started crying.

973
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,161
Whatever happened to that guy?

974
01:16:28,259 --> 01:16:30,747
- He went to a different
high school... Madison.
- How do you know?

975
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,633
'Cause Nancy Weinberg kept on going out
with him all through high school.

976
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:35,553
Whatever happened to that guy?

977
01:16:35,652 --> 01:16:39,394
I don't know. I heard that Nancy
Weinberg is in grad school at Yale.

978
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:42,622
Yale. Yale.

979
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,505
- Tom, what are you doing?
You're going now?
- I gotta go!

980
01:16:56,098 --> 01:17:00,059
I've been driving all night.
I have to tell you something.

981
01:17:01,314 --> 01:17:03,137
Can I come in?

982
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:22,432
Ruth, please.

983
01:17:25,218 --> 01:17:27,803
You lied to me.

984
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,008
You used my son...

985
01:17:33,155 --> 01:17:35,128
the memory of my son.

986
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:41,376
That was all I had left.

987
01:17:45,473 --> 01:17:47,546
How could you do that?

988
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:09,783
I remember when my third-grade teacher
cut her finger on a paper cutter...

989
01:18:09,889 --> 01:18:11,712
and had to go home.

990
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,430
I remember when Bruce Feinbaum
tripped Matthew Ellison...

991
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:20,351
during the fire drill...

992
01:18:20,449 --> 01:18:23,385
An-and everyone laughed.

993
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:27,613
L... I have a really
good memory, Ruth,

994
01:18:27,712 --> 01:18:29,534
but...

995
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:33,375
no matter how hard
I wracked my brain,

996
01:18:33,473 --> 01:18:35,293
I couldn't remember your son.

997
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,832
The fact that I could...

998
01:18:39,936 --> 01:18:41,757
forget him like that,

999
01:18:41,856 --> 01:18:43,678
that his life could...

1000
01:18:45,088 --> 01:18:48,055
leave so little impressión on me,
that really scared me.

1001
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,982
I mean, it...

1002
01:18:51,646 --> 01:18:53,468
It terrified me.

1003
01:18:58,144 --> 01:19:00,926
Because I wouldn't
want to be forgotten.

1004
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:10,292
I- I'm sorry. Sh-Should
I just keep waiting in the car?

1005
01:19:12,318 --> 01:19:14,456
No, it's okay.

1006
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,199
R- Ruth.

1007
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,501
Um...

1008
01:19:31,742 --> 01:19:34,361
This is Tom Thompson.

1009
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:42,523
Hi, Mrs. Abernathy.

1010
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:02,006
He, uh, wanted you
to have his car.

1011
01:20:03,742 --> 01:20:06,162
Oh, no. No. No.

1012
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,691
L... It'd be too sad.

1013
01:20:10,878 --> 01:20:12,699
Look, I have a car.

1014
01:20:15,453 --> 01:20:18,934
Well, l... I did put
some money into it.

1015
01:20:19,037 --> 01:20:21,176
You keep it.

1016
01:20:21,276 --> 01:20:23,099
Yeah?

1017
01:20:25,406 --> 01:20:27,227
So, uh,

1018
01:20:27,325 --> 01:20:29,148
you guys were close?

1019
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:31,864
Not really.
We just knew each other.

1020
01:20:54,171 --> 01:20:56,692
It's so hard to let him go.

1021
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,281
I don't know.

1022
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:04,756
I mean,

1023
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:08,951
I needed someone.

1024
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:15,994
I needed someone too.

1025
01:21:30,523 --> 01:21:32,466
# Let the river #

1026
01:21:32,572 --> 01:21:35,703
# Rock you like a cradle #

1027
01:21:37,148 --> 01:21:39,831
# Climb to the treetops #

1028
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:42,233
# Child, if you're able #

1029
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:46,682
# Let your hands tie a knot #

1030
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:49,594
- # Across the table #
- May He lift His countenance upon you...

1031
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:52,243
- and grant you His most precious gift...
- # Come #

1032
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:55,315
- # And touch the things
you cannot feel #
- and His blessings of peace.

1033
01:21:55,419 --> 01:21:57,306
- Amen.
- Amen.

1034
01:21:57,402 --> 01:22:01,145
# And close your fingertips #

1035
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:03,665
# And fly where I can't hold you #

1036
01:22:03,771 --> 01:22:06,041
Mazel tov!

1037
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,960
# Let the sun rain fall #

1038
01:22:08,058 --> 01:22:12,467
# And let the blue clouds
enfold you #

1039
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:15,505
# And maybe you can sing to me #

1040
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:19,155
# The words I just told you #

1041
01:22:19,256 --> 01:22:23,535
# With all the things
your feelings were facing #

1042
01:22:25,017 --> 01:22:28,367
# Then don't mind me #

1043
01:22:28,475 --> 01:22:31,823
# 'Cause I ain't nothin' #

1044
01:22:31,929 --> 01:22:34,712
# But a dream #

1045
01:22:39,577 --> 01:22:43,800
# The mockingbird
sings each different song #

1046
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:48,600
# Each song has wings #

1047
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:52,177
# They won't stay long #

1048
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:54,932
# Do those who hear #

1049
01:22:55,033 --> 01:22:58,131
# Think he's doing wrong #

1050
01:22:59,193 --> 01:23:01,877
# While the church bell #

1051
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:04,759
# Tolls its one-note song #

1052
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:08,312
# And the school bell #

1053
01:23:08,408 --> 01:23:10,709
# Is tinkling to the throng #

1054
01:23:13,305 --> 01:23:15,246
# Come here #

1055
01:23:15,353 --> 01:23:18,801
# Where your ears cannot hear #

1056
01:23:20,216 --> 01:23:23,697
# And close your ears #

1057
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:28,437
# Child, and listen
to what I'll tell you #

1058
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,503
# Follow in the darkest night #

1059
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:35,384
# The sounds that may impel you #

1060
01:23:35,481 --> 01:23:37,935
# And the song that I am singing #

1061
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:42,479
# May disturb or serve to quell you #

1062
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:47,157
# If all the sound
you're hearing is what they sing #

1063
01:23:48,312 --> 01:23:51,695
# Then don't mind me #

1064
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,095
# 'Cause I ain't nothin' #

1065
01:23:55,191 --> 01:23:57,712
# But a dream #

1066
01:23:57,817 --> 01:24:01,198
# Mm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm ##

1067
01:24:27,798 --> 01:24:29,621
Julie.

1068
01:24:31,798 --> 01:24:35,628
Tom, leave me alone.

1069
01:24:35,734 --> 01:24:37,971
I just wanted
to give you this.

1070
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,873
Julie, pl...

1071
01:24:42,934 --> 01:24:45,423
- Julie, wait!
- Tom, don't do this.

1072
01:24:45,526 --> 01:24:47,860
- Please, just take this.
- Tom.

1073
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:51,220
I don't want this.
I'm going away.

1074
01:24:53,014 --> 01:24:54,838
It's a birthday present.

1075
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:56,755
Belated. Please.

1076
01:25:00,215 --> 01:25:02,417
Please.

1077
01:25:04,918 --> 01:25:07,154
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1078
01:25:07,254 --> 01:25:11,955
The band is gonna take a short break
now, but we'll be back a little later.

1079
01:25:21,814 --> 01:25:23,634
I don't understand.

1080
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:26,994
It has a new carburetor,
if that's what you're worried about.

1081
01:25:30,805 --> 01:25:33,587
Tom.

1082
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:36,106
Uh, I can't take your car.

1083
01:25:36,213 --> 01:25:38,996
The tires are good
for another 10,000 miles,

1084
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:42,092
so, you know,
that should take you...

1085
01:25:42,197 --> 01:25:44,020
wherever you wanna go.

1086
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:53,011
It's a really good car.
Please take it.

1087
01:25:53,108 --> 01:25:55,411
I'll be your deejay
this evening spinning tunes.

1088
01:25:55,508 --> 01:25:58,290
We're gonna slow things down
with this one.

1089
01:25:58,388 --> 01:26:00,909
# Come to me now #

1090
01:26:03,379 --> 01:26:06,696
- # Lay yourself over me #
- I love this song.

1091
01:26:08,307 --> 01:26:11,091
- # Even if it's wrong #
- Is that a signal?

1092
01:26:11,187 --> 01:26:13,578
# We'll be all right #

1093
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:16,553
# And I shall believe #

1094
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:21,160
# Broken in two #

1095
01:26:23,508 --> 01:26:27,250
# And I know you're onto me #

1096
01:26:28,627 --> 01:26:31,050
# That I only come home #

1097
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:33,840
# When I'm so all alone #

1098
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:37,135
# And I do believe #

1099
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:44,944
# That not everything is gonna be
the way you think it oughta be #

1100
01:26:45,043 --> 01:26:49,713
# It seems that every time I try to make
it right it all comes down on me #

1101
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:52,364
# Please say honestly #

1102
01:26:52,466 --> 01:26:56,809
# You won't give up on me #

1103
01:26:56,916 --> 01:27:00,329
# And I shall believe #

1104
01:27:02,003 --> 01:27:04,936
# And I shall believe #

1105
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:09,453
# Open the door #

1106
01:27:12,146 --> 01:27:15,494
# And show me your face tonight #

1107
01:27:16,562 --> 01:27:19,213
# I know it's true #

1108
01:27:19,314 --> 01:27:22,216
# No one heals me like you #

1109
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:25,804
# And you hold the key #

1110
01:27:28,019 --> 01:27:33,287
# Then not everything is gonna be
the way you think it oughta be #

1111
01:27:33,394 --> 01:27:38,129
# It seems like every time I try to make
it right it all comes down on me #

1112
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:40,614
# Please say honestly #

1113
01:27:40,721 --> 01:27:44,038
# You won't give up on me #

1114
01:27:45,331 --> 01:27:48,679
# And I shall believe ##

1115
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:56,015
- Hello?
- What's going on?

1116
01:27:56,114 --> 01:27:57,936
We have a problem here.

1117
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:03,048
- Did you knock?
- I'm knocking. Hello!

1118
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:04,976
Hello!

1119
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,982
What's going on?

1120
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,869
She won't come out.

1121
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:12,335
Wh... Oh, Jesus.

1122
01:28:12,432 --> 01:28:14,733
Ma.

1123
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:18,694
Ma, come on. I'm only
gonna be ten minutes away, Ma.

1124
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,583
- No.
- We'll see each other all the time.

1125
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:23,720
- I don't want you to go.
- Ma...

1126
01:28:23,824 --> 01:28:25,735
- Ma!
- Not now!

1127
01:28:28,945 --> 01:28:31,727
I just got over
that back injury from roller-blading.

1128
01:28:31,824 --> 01:28:34,541
I'm just saying,
this is getting heavier and heavier.

1129
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:37,902
What happens when Julie comes back?
You'll have to move again?

1130
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,781
- No, she gave it to me.
They're letting me rent it.

1131
01:28:40,879 --> 01:28:42,822
You wanna be careful
with my bunk bed?

1132
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:44,750
You wanna complain, you pay.

1133
01:28:46,992 --> 01:28:49,774
So, is that, uh,
the last of it?

1134
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:52,654
That's everything. Don't worry.
This is gonna be good, Tom.

1135
01:28:52,752 --> 01:28:56,199
- What if this job doesn't work out?
- Didn't you get the job already?

1136
01:28:56,304 --> 01:28:59,087
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't work out.
- It's gonna work out.

1137
01:28:59,185 --> 01:29:01,006
Come on, let's go.

1138
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:06,506
- # Come a little bit closer #
- Tom, let's go.

1139
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:10,349
- # Hear what I have to say #
- Come on, Tom.
It's getting late.

1140
01:29:11,759 --> 01:29:14,541
- Hey, Tom, come on!
- Tom, you ready?

1141
01:29:14,638 --> 01:29:16,614
All right, all right.

1142
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,541
I'm ready.

1143
01:29:18,638 --> 01:29:22,982
- # Just like children sleepin' #
- Let's move.

1144
01:29:23,215 --> 01:29:27,076
# You'll dream this night away #

1145
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:38,635
# But there's a full moon risin' #

1146
01:29:38,735 --> 01:29:44,452
# Let's go dancin' in the light #

1147
01:29:50,957 --> 01:29:54,852
# We know where the music's playin' #

1148
01:29:54,958 --> 01:30:00,839
# Let's go out and feel the night #

1149
01:30:07,022 --> 01:30:11,528
# Because I'm still in love with you #

1150
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:15,371
# I wanna see you dance again #

1151
01:30:15,468 --> 01:30:20,074
# Because I'm still in love with you #

1152
01:30:20,173 --> 01:30:25,737
# On this harvest moon ##

1153
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,548
This is what I believe.

1154
01:30:59,692 --> 01:31:02,627
# Been so long since I met you #

1155
01:31:04,396 --> 01:31:07,942
# And all the changes we been through #

1156
01:31:09,389 --> 01:31:12,486
# And all this time I can't forget you #

1157
01:31:13,996 --> 01:31:18,818
# Everywhere I turn I think of you #

1158
01:31:18,924 --> 01:31:21,640
# I #

1159
01:31:21,739 --> 01:31:23,430
# Wanna trust ya, lady #

1160
01:31:23,532 --> 01:31:26,249
# And you #

1161
01:31:26,348 --> 01:31:28,649
# You're all I need #

1162
01:31:28,748 --> 01:31:31,082
# Soul to soul, fire to fire #

1163
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:33,568
# Nothin' to light this man's desire #

1164
01:31:33,675 --> 01:31:37,122
# Love is a beautiful thing #

1165
01:31:38,506 --> 01:31:40,929
# One to one, you and me #

1166
01:31:41,035 --> 01:31:43,043
# Oh, I know it's our destiny #

1167
01:31:43,148 --> 01:31:47,970
- # 'Cause love is a beautiful thing #
- # Beautiful, so beautiful #

1168
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:50,659
# To stay together
through thick and thin #

1169
01:31:50,763 --> 01:31:52,901
# Now I know I got a friend #

1170
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:58,022
# 'Cause love is a beautiful thing #

1171
01:31:58,123 --> 01:32:00,675
# We've faced the fears
all through the years #

1172
01:32:00,778 --> 01:32:05,864
- # Now I know there are no more tears #
- # Love is a beautiful thing #

1173
01:32:05,962 --> 01:32:07,850
# Ahh, ohh-ooh #

1174
01:32:07,946 --> 01:32:10,369
# Soul to soul, fire to fire #

1175

# Nothin' to light
this man's desire #

1176
01:32:12,489 --> 01:32:15,938
# Because love is a beautiful thing #

1177
01:32:16,043 --> 01:32:19,174
- # Ohh ohh-ohh #
- # Ohh-whoa-whoa #

1178
01:32:19,275 --> 01:32:22,624

Oh, I know it's our destiny #
