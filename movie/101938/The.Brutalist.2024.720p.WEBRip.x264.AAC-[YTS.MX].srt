00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,151
Calm down, your escort is right outside.
Sit down.

4
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,987
Sit. I said sit.

5
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,031
She tells us that you are her niece.

6
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,033
Is that correct? Are you her niece?

7
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,660
Where is your mother?

8
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,037
Do you know?

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,959
Look at me!
Do you understand me?

10
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,921
If you are from Budapest,
state the name and street number

11
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,714
of your former place of residence.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,466
There's a pen and paper.

13
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,636
If you prefer not to speak to us,
write it down with your family name,

14
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,096
and we will try and confirm it.

15
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,765
Is it possible the woman outside
is not related to you,

16
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,227
but is simply an ally you made
along the way who is trying to help you?

17
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,396
You bear little resemblance
to one another.

18
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,358
We will not punish her for trying
to help an innocent young woman.

19
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,027
We want to help you get home.

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
Your true home.

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,824
<i>László, I am alive.</i>

22
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,910
Come on! Documents.

23
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,456
<i>Attila tells me that you, too, are alive</i>
<i>and en route to him from Bremerhaven.</i>

24
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,749
<i>Rejoice!</i>

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,504
<i>I cried out in ecstasy</i>
<i>to have news of you.</i>

26
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,298
Where are my things?

27
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,967
- What?
- Screw you!

28
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,176
It is not amusing to me!

29
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,220
Stop it! Don't look at me that way,
old man!

30
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,889
- It's right behind you.
- Where is my luggage?

31
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,515
It's tucked there under the mattress!

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,808
Now come on!

33
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,936
Hurry, László,
or we'll be last in the queue.

34
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:11,901
<i>Zsófia is with me, though she is frail,</i>
<i>strange, and quite ill.</i>

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>We anxiously await</i>
<i>our being repatriated,</i>

36
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,157
<i>but recently, she has not been herself,</i>

37
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,827
<i>which has, in turn, roused unnecessary</i>
<i>suspicions with local officials.</i>

38
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>Fortunately, a few Soviet boys</i>
<i>have taken a liking to us.</i>

39
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,595
<i>They pity your poor niece in particular,</i>

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,183
<i>who has grown fuller, even lovelier,</i>
<i>since you last set eyes on her.</i>

41
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,354
<i>These lonesome young servicemen</i>
<i>are ostensibly entranced</i>

42
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,483
<i>by such a radiant creature's</i>
<i>commitment to absolute silence.</i>

43
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,820
<i>The Soviets have helped us relocate</i>

44
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,573
<i>to a nearby shelter</i>
<i>for displaced persons in Vas.</i>

45
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,953
<i>They encourage us</i>
<i>to "enjoy our freedoms",</i>

46
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,038
<i>but I am reminded of Goethe.</i>

47
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,040
<i>"None are more hopelessly enslaved</i>

48
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,292
<i>than those</i>
<i>who falsely believe themselves free!"</i>

49
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,256
<i>I make no mistake,</i>
<i>we are not yet free.</i>

50
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,508
Come on already.

51
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,929
<i>You, like myself, must be envisioning</i>
<i>so many terribly awful, awful things,</i>

52
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,766
<i>but it is better that your thoughts</i>
<i>do not get the best of you.</i>

53
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,437
<i>It is neither better nor worse</i>
<i>than you might imagine.</i>

54
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,194
<i>I have kept myself mostly to myself.</i>

55
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>More importantly,</i>

56
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,788
<i>I have defended Zsófia</i>
<i>from unwanted advances.</i>

57
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>Below is the address</i>
<i>I am told for mail in Vas.</i>

58
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,719
<i>Please write to me at once</i>
<i>when you have received this.</i>

59
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,764
<i>I am certain now</i>

60
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,766
<i>there is nothing left for us here.</i>

61
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,269
Look at that!

62
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,236
- What did I tell you?!
- Yes!

63
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,035
<i>Go to America and I will follow you.</i>

64
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,667
<i>Faithfully, Erzsébet.</i>

65
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,167
Fuck her already!

66
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,501
Shut up.

67
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,256
Shut your mouth!

68
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,578
I'll see you.

69
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,080
I'll see you.

70
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,934
Take care.

71
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,240
What did you say?

72
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,534
What did you say?

73
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,786
I have a letter from her.

74
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:12,584
Your Erzsébet is alive
and she is with little Zsófia.

75
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,004
Yes?

76
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,343
Yes?

77
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,417
Thank you.

78
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,219
Gentile?

79
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,492
<i>László, I am alive.</i>

80
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:06,456
<i>Attila tells me that you, too, are alive</i>
<i>and en route to him from Bremerhaven.</i>

81
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,416
<i>Rejoice!</i>

82
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,128
<i>I cried out in ecstasy</i>
<i>to have news of you...</i>

83
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,059
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

84
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,221
<i>On the 29th of November, 1947,</i>

85
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:56,811
<i>the United Nations General Assembly</i>
<i>passed a resolution</i>

86
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:02,984
<i>calling for the establishment</i>
<i>of a Jewish state in Eretz Yisrael.</i>

87
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:09,657
<i>The General Assembly required</i>
<i>the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael</i>

88
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,744
<i>to take such steps</i>
<i>as were necessary on their part</i>

89
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,624
<i>for the implementation</i>
<i>of that resolution.</i>

90
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:23,212
<i>This recognition by the United Nations</i>

91
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:29,719
<i>of the right of the Jewish people</i>
<i>to establish their state is irrevocable.</i>

92
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,557
<i>This right is the natural right</i>
<i>of the Jewish people</i>

93
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,685
<i>to be masters of their own fate,</i>

94
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,315
<i>like all other nations,</i>
<i>in their own sovereign state.</i>

95
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:48,070
<i>Accordingly we,</i>
<i>members of the people's council,</i>

96
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:53,159
<i>representatives of the Jewish</i>
<i>community of Eretz Yisrael</i>

97
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,369
<i>and of the Zionist Movement,</i>

98
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,788
<i>are here assembled</i>
<i>on the day of the termination</i>

99
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,249
<i>of the British mandate</i>
<i>over Eretz Yisrael.</i>

100
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,505
<i>And by virtue of our natural</i>
<i>and historic right,</i>

101
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:13,596
<i>and on the basis of the resolution</i>
<i>of the United Nations General Assembly,</i>

102
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:18,392
<i>hereby declare the establishment</i>
<i>of a Jewish state in Eretz Yisrael,</i>

103
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,436
<i>to be known as the State of Israel.</i>

104
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,488
Come. Come.

105
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,224
What is it?

106
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,982
I take you into my home,

107
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:02,529
into my place of business,
and this is how you thank me?

108
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:22,984
<i>Erzsébet,</i>

109
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:25,653
<i>I can be reached by mail</i>
<i>at a new address...</i>

110
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:29,824
<i>I wait for you. I wait and wait.</i>

111
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:34,662
<i>Do you need money?</i>
<i>What do you need?</i>

112
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,164
<i>Yours, László.</i>

113
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,726
What? What?

114
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,368
You're welcome.

115
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:03,696
<i>Erzsébet, I have become acquainted</i>
<i>with an influential American attorney</i>

116
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:06,949
<i>who says he can help you</i>
<i>and Zsófia with your situation.</i>

117
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,661
<i>Is there somewhere</i>
<i>we might find a photograph</i>

118
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,663
<i>of you and Zsófia pictured together?</i>

119
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:23,007
<i>Anything linking her to you?</i>

120
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:25,759
<i>I have reached out to colleagues</i>

121
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,095
<i>who sometimes attended parties</i>
<i>at the house.</i>

122
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,847
<i>I am waiting on return.</i>

123
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:39,481
<i>Whomever comes to mind, write to them</i>
<i>and explain how urgent this is.</i>

124
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,736
<i>Anything tying her to you,</i>
<i>and you to me,</i>

125
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:46,655
<i>can be of great assistance</i>
<i>to Mr Hoffman.</i>

126
01:28:55,789 --> 01:29:00,502
<i>I have enclosed a list of items and</i>
<i>information requested by his office.</i>

127
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:05,883
<i>Please fill out what you can</i>
<i>of these documents</i>

128
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,719
<i>and return these originals</i>
<i>to me at once.</i>

129
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:16,560
<i>Here: some good fortune</i>
<i>may have fallen upon me.</i>

130
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,229
<i>In an unexpected turn of events,</i>

131
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:23,776
<i>I have been offered an intriguing</i>
<i>opportunity, a second chance.</i>

132
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:35,037
<i>I can feel you nearer to me now</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

133
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,124
<i>Your love, László.</i>

134
01:39:01,645 --> 01:39:03,021
<i>László!</i>

135
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,067
<i>It has taken some months to obtain</i>
<i>the items which Mr Hoffman requested</i>

136
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,902
<i>since receiving your letter.</i>

137
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:12,072
<i>I was at a loss at first,</i>

138
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:18,370
<i>but suddenly thought to contact our</i>
<i>upstairs neighbour in Buda, Mrs Horváth!</i>

139
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:29,172
<i>She was able to provide me</i>
<i>with several family photographs</i>

140
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:32,175
<i>that clearly picture you,</i>
<i>myself, and Zsófia</i>

141
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,094
<i>with her mother</i>
<i>on our wedding day.</i>

142
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:38,306
<i>The poor dear thought us dead</i>
<i>all these years,</i>

143
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,850
<i>so had kept them</i>
<i>on her mantelpiece in memoriam.</i>

144
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,192
<i>Zsófia could have only been</i>
<i>nine years of age at the time,</i>

145
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:53,488
<i>but her face and expression</i>
<i>are unmistakable.</i>

146
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,659
<i>I have included all but one</i>

147
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:01,579
<i>in case this letter</i>
<i>does not reach you.</i>

148
01:40:02,706 --> 01:40:04,666
<i>I will keep it near my breast,</i>

149
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:07,043
<i>our family tree against my heart.</i>

150
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,090
<i>László,</i>

151
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,801
<i>does this mean</i>
<i>we might meet again soon?</i>

152
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,972
<i>Yours, Erzsébet.</i>

153
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:57,881
What's happened?

154
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:04,304
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

155
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:05,680
What happened?

156
01:43:06,306 --> 01:43:07,932
It might not be permanent.

157
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:09,809
What happened? Did someone hurt you?

158
01:43:12,145 --> 01:43:14,731
It's osteoporosis from the famine.

159
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,904
I'll dye my hair. I know it's ugly.

160
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:28,828
Where's Attila?

161
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:43,384
Zsófia, dear.

162
01:47:14,387 --> 01:47:16,556
I'm sorry for the toys.

163
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:21,018
I remembered you as a little girl.

164
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:27,984
Look at your mother.

165
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,949
My sister was beautiful, wasn't she?

166
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:10,401
Are you angry?

167
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,074
Are you angry with me
for not telling you about my condition?

168
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:22,807
You can touch me.

169
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:45,032
Oh, my God!

170
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:54,735
Fuck!

171
02:03:19,351 --> 02:03:22,938
I'm proud of you.
Make love to me tonight.

172
02:11:01,521 --> 02:11:03,773
Don't go near him, Zsófia.

173
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:55,768
Oh, my God!

174
02:21:08,752 --> 02:21:09,879
Fuck.

175
02:21:13,174 --> 02:21:14,049
Fuck!

176
02:21:17,428 --> 02:21:19,430
Damn it all to hell!

177
02:22:11,607 --> 02:22:13,150
Fuck!

178
02:31:21,698 --> 02:31:22,949
Hello, László, my friend!

179
02:31:25,577 --> 02:31:27,829
Hello, Orazio.

180
02:31:38,423 --> 02:31:40,467
I will take a coffee and we can go.

181
02:31:57,734 --> 02:32:00,237
You are tough, Mr László, you know?

182
02:32:09,913 --> 02:32:13,708
There aren't many people I see
anymore from before the war.

183
02:32:13,834 --> 02:32:16,044
I'm not surprised to see you, though.

184
02:32:17,587 --> 02:32:21,842
Some people, you just knew
somehow they would be all right.

185
02:32:22,425 --> 02:32:24,052
Because you are stubborn.

186
02:32:25,178 --> 02:32:26,471
And so am I.

187
02:32:27,931 --> 02:32:29,641
I will never leave this place.

188
02:32:29,766 --> 02:32:31,393
<i>Because you are stubborn.</i>

189
02:32:31,518 --> 02:32:33,395
<i>And so am I.</i>

190
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,605
<i>I will never leave this place.</i>

191
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:40,694
I have left only once in 20 years
to go to Giulino, Azzano,

192
02:32:40,819 --> 02:32:45,156
to beat the corpse of Mussolini
with my own hands.

193
02:32:46,116 --> 02:32:51,454
Those of us here, my colleagues,
we are anarchists.

194
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:53,540
We were part of the Resistance.

195
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:56,293
No one knows the quarries like us.

196
02:32:56,418 --> 02:32:57,669
We fought and captured

197
02:32:57,794 --> 02:33:02,007
many members
of the National Republican Army.

198
02:33:02,132 --> 02:33:05,051
We trapped them in these caves.

199
02:33:05,176 --> 02:33:08,346
And we dropped
these very same stones on them.

200
02:34:36,518 --> 02:34:39,980
The channelling here
will be done in one month.

201
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:45,026
If you like it, we can have it fixed
and ready for you in April.

202
02:34:55,996 --> 02:34:57,247
We like it.

203
02:34:58,248 --> 02:34:59,457
We like it.

204
02:35:46,796 --> 02:35:49,382
Hey! Come, come.

205
02:35:50,175 --> 02:35:53,303
This is my great old friend.

206
02:35:53,803 --> 02:35:55,346
Good evening.

207
02:43:04,901 --> 02:43:07,653
<i>My dearest Zsófia! Mazel tov!</i>

208
02:43:08,404 --> 02:43:11,657
<i>She is so beautiful.</i>
<i>Your spitting image!</i>

209
02:43:15,661 --> 02:43:18,706
<i>Don't be mad,</i>
<i>but your Uncle László insisted</i>

210
02:43:18,831 --> 02:43:21,417
<i>I enclose a few banknotes</i>
<i>for you and Binyamin.</i>

211
02:43:22,084 --> 02:43:24,295
<i>We hope he won't be offended,</i>

212
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:25,713
<i>and that it's not too difficult</i>

213
02:43:25,838 --> 02:43:27,840
<i>to change these</i>
<i>into the local currency.</i>

214
02:43:34,472 --> 02:43:37,433
<i>Here, I am so alone.</i>

215
02:43:39,101 --> 02:43:41,145
<i>Perhaps more alone</i>
<i>than I have ever been.</i>

216
02:43:43,064 --> 02:43:45,858
<i>Your uncle closed a door to me.</i>

217
02:43:46,692 --> 02:43:48,528
<i>The man I married is inside,</i>

218
02:43:48,653 --> 02:43:52,365
<i>but the lock's combination</i>
<i>I cannot decipher...</i>

219
02:43:55,326 --> 02:43:57,662
<i>Your uncle no longer attends synagogue.</i>

220
02:43:59,622 --> 02:44:01,082
<i>He prefers to roam obsessively</i>

221
02:44:01,207 --> 02:44:03,584
<i>through the corridors</i>
<i>of his construction in Doylestown.</i>

222
02:44:06,879 --> 02:44:09,215
<i>There, at last, much progress</i>
<i>has been made,</i>

223
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:10,716
<i>yet he seems no more content</i>

224
02:44:10,841 --> 02:44:13,844
<i>than on the day the Institute</i>
<i>first broke ground.</i>

225
02:44:17,181 --> 02:44:19,100
<i>I suppose that inside,</i>

226
02:44:19,225 --> 02:44:21,269
<i>he worships at the altar</i>
<i>of only himself.</i>

227
02:44:23,354 --> 02:44:24,897
<i>Tell me how you are.</i>

228
02:44:26,065 --> 02:44:27,608
<i>How you really are.</i>

229
02:44:30,069 --> 02:44:34,115
<i>All our love and warmth</i>
<i>to the three of you.</i>

230
02:44:35,825 --> 02:44:36,909
<i>Erzsébet.</i>

231
02:53:05,584 --> 02:53:06,668
I love you.

232
02:53:09,797 --> 02:53:12,007
I love you.

233
02:53:19,807 --> 02:53:21,225
Yes.

234
02:53:23,727 --> 02:53:25,813
I love you.

235
02:54:10,649 --> 02:54:11,817
More.

236
02:54:12,776 --> 02:54:14,194
More.
