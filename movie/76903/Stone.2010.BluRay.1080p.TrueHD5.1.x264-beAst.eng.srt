1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,469
( clock ticking )

2
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,822
Male TV announcer:
It was a very short putt.

3
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,331
lt would see'm routine had he not
just come off a bogey the hole before.

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,732
M'm-h'm'm, obviously
smarting from that.

5
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,874
- But let's see what he does here.
- ( ball rattles into hole )

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,976
Oh perfect.
Textbook, textbook.

7
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,170
We 'move ahead now to Lee Trevino
on the fairway at the seventh.

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,714
His lie looks as though
he may be in a little divot.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,376
AbsoIutely. Tournament officiaIs
have been cracking down

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,386
on caddies filling in the divots.

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,549
At this leveI of the game, some of us
gotta watch the etiquette of golf.

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,820
( insect buzzing )

13
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,938
Just go to sleep.

14
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,247
( insect buzzing )

15
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,763
TV announcer:
A lovely approach.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,066
He's considering it now.
I presume that a player like...

17
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,368
( buzzing continues )

18
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,650
( buzz echoing )

19
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,335
TV announcer: Sand wedge
or inter'mediate pitching wedge.

20
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,097
Oh, very exciting.
He's lining up the shot.

21
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,275
Look at 'me.

22
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,411
Hmm?

23
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,110
l'm not standing for this.

24
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,254
Sorry

25
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,351
You keep my soul in a dungeon.

26
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,819
l'm leaving.

27
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,000
Jack

28
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,317
- Jack.
- lf you leave me, l'll throw her.

29
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,454
( bee buzzing )

30
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,954
You think that l won't, h'mm?

31
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,323
- Please.
- Do you think I won't!

32
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,787
l won't leave.
I won't leave you.

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,534
( buzzing stops )

34
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,744
l''m sorry.
Don't ever do that again.

35
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,545
Don't ever leave 'me.
Don't ever do that again.

36
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,997
All things bright and beautiful

37
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,369
All creatures great and small

38
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,410
All things wise and wonderful

39
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,347
The Lord God made them alI.

40
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,543
l invite you to be seated at this time.

41
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,859
( applause on TV )

42
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,188
TV announcer #1:
Oh, that's a very nice touch.

43
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,627
So maybe he can make a par.
And at worse from there

44
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,426
you'd think he could stay
his point total.

45
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,365
Now here we find him
with a 7-iron at this par-3 hole.

46
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,102
Announcer #2:
I don't know if there was a problem

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,246
with him slippin' with his right foot
there, but definitely a pull.

48
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,108
Announcer #1:
He obviously had the thought in his head

49
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,943
that he needed
to give it a little bit extra,

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,415
and he's found himseIf
in a difficult spot.

51
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,646
Announcer #2: All the expectations
he had coming into this...

52
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,950
( ringing )

53
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,927
- HeIlo?
- Woman: Jack.

54
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,795
Betsy.

55
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,596
Your brother slipped away.

56
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,672
Oh oh,

57
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,308
finally out of his misery.

58
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,671
- Betsy: Yes, he is.
- Oh, l know, l know.

59
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,973
And how 'many ti'mes did l hear, '"Why
can't you be like your brother Bobby''?

60
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,515
lf l had a nickel for every time
that was said to 'me...

61
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,614
l'd be a rich man today.

62
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,156
That scar on his forehead that he had,

63
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,193
he aIways had a story for it,

64
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,661
but it was 'me. l threw a ha'm'mer
at Mr. Perfect when I was eight.

65
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,630
( crowd murmuring )

66
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,031
He never told though.
He covered for the people he loved.

67
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,503
That's how he was
and I loved him for that.

68
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,142
And l wanted to be like him.

69
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,039
Everything--

70
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,350
l just want to say that...

71
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,160
if it wasn't for Bobby, l'd...

72
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,993
l-l don't know...

73
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,502
where l would've wound up.

74
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,201
He taught 'me how to live,
what was right.

75
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,170
l'm gonna miss him.

76
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,580
He lived right. He lived right.
He was...

77
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:30,553
what 'more could you s--
want peopIe to say about you?

78
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,216
( bird squawking )

79
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,659
Woman on radio: AIl throughout Scripture
it talks about God being a just God.

80
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,665
l 'mean, l just read the parable
about the unjust judge,

81
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,737
where the wo'man kept co'ming
and coming and saying...

82
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,067
Man #1 on radio:
Caring, loving, forgiving...

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,903
Man #2: l'm wondering if you concur
with what you've heard so far?

84
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,944
Man #3: l think that the choices,
the idea of free will,

85
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,048
and the fact that
we have freedom of choice...

86
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,582
( overlapping dialogue on radio )

87
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,089
Male radio host #1:
The reality of the times we live in,

88
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,724
this notion that-- this angst that a lot
of people are feeling in this country,

89
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,133
that we've gone through so'me sort
of fundamentaI transformation...

90
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,774
Male radio host #2:
...Barack Obama earlier today, crediting

91
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,606
his so-called sti'mulus package
that he signed four or five months ago,

92
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,772
as '"putting cash
into the pockets of taxpayers.''

93
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,942
lf you're a taxpayer
in the Detroit area

94
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,553
who got cash in your pocket
from the stimuIus plan,

95
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,952
l'd Iove to hear from ya, and you
can also check in via the internet,

96
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,955
but we would love
to hear from you personally.

97
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,594
Kevin in Warren. We go to Kevin.
Kevin thanks so much for calling.

98
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,059
Welco'me.

99
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,066
Hi, Paul.

100
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,009
Thanks.

101
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,355
( people chattering )

102
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,145
No, it's true.

103
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,046
With God is my witness, I've changed.

104
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,483
With Jesus and my family...
( voice echoing )

105
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,127
( voices overlapping, echoing )

106
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,845
Oh my God,
l'm sorry for what l've done.

107
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,880
l 'mean, l robbed a godda'mn
liquor store with a toy gun.

108
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,042
What kinda--
what kinda idiot does that

109
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,380
( voices echoing )

110
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,771
Warden wants to see you.

111
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,544
Hi, Allie.

112
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,847
- Hi, Mitch. Janice.
- Jack.

113
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,253
- What's up
- Shut the door, Jack.

114
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,227
This Deshawn Mackey guy.

115
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,108
- This is yours? Your report, right
- Yeah. Yeah. Why?

116
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,800
lt's an inco'mpetent mess, Jack.

117
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,776
l 'mean, look, l know your head's
aIready out on the golf course,

118
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,145
but this is a travesty
of proper casework here.

119
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,590
( snickers )

120
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,250
- l got ya.
- You got me.

121
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,297
Here. Learn from the master
of understatement.

122
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,934
- Absolutely.
- Keep 'em brief.

123
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,799
Now l need to get Janice up to speed
before you're out the back door,

124
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,340
so let's pass all your
indeterminates eligible off to her.

125
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,741
Yeah yeah, of course,
but l'd like to stay on 'my currents,

126
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,973
if l can see them through
to review-- is that okay?

127
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,749
Yeah, if you're wiIling.

128
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,353
- l would like to. Thank you.
- Yeah.

129
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,956
- We're good.
- Janice: Okay.

130
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,184
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

131
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,953
Excuse me

132
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,359
Your brother--
I just recently heard, l'm sorry.

133
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,295
Thank you.

134
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,133
- Okay.

135
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,469

136
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,476

00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,037

00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,141

142
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,385
Gerald Creeson.
So what's Stone, like a nickna'me?

143
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,215
That's something from here

144
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,084
No. Oh no, man.
Fuck all these assholes.

Yo, that's what 'my people call 'me.

Listen listen, look, l don't talk

241
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,662
you know,
I've been locked up a long time.

242
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,529
You don't need 'much 'more than two
pumps and a swirl to get it done.

243
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,136
l don't consider this polite
conversation.

244
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,104
l ain't tryin' to be rude, okay
l really want to know

245
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,266
where does that go

246
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,878
Or where do you put it, if you--

247
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,707

248

249
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,042
how you keep a lid on that.

250
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,382
We're not--
we're not talking about me.

251
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,354
We're not taIking about me, okay

252
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,317
Radio host:
Man looks on the outward appearance.

253
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,725
God looks on the heart.

254
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,230
And certainly the heart
of a man does 'matter,

255
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,698
because out of the abundance
of the heart the 'mouth speaks...

256
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,303
( speaking Spanish )

257
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,688
Male radio caIler: OnIy in the choices
that God decides to present to us.

258
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,224
Host:
Well, no, l'm not saying that.

259
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,728
l''m saying that l just believe
that we're automatons...

260
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,521
Radio:
...and here's the deal:

261
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,358
- l did not choose to be born...
- Madylyn: This is very very serious.

262
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,695
...and l cannot choose to be born again.

263
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,098
She's four-- can you believe it

264
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,796
Radio: l had no choice
in that matter whatsoever, and yet

265
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,272
- there are so 'many people that...
- Where have you gone

266
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,274
...think they have a choice
in the matter

267
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,937
of their spiritual rebirth
and their spiritual for'mation.

268
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,381
The fact of the matter is, a seed
is planted and conception takes place,

269
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,748
- which you had nothing to do with.
- Male calIer: Amen.

270
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,117
All Voices Under God, WDDL,

271
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,818
wiIl continue here right after
these very i'mportant 'messages.

272
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,632
Stone: Look, we was high as shit
and we were lookin' for 'money.

273
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,664
You know
My poppy hears us.

274
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,302
Him and Teach have words.

275
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,960
Poppy goes and gets his gun.

276
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,163
And l was like, "'Fuck this.
I don't want no part of this,''

277
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,967
and l went outside.

278
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,010
So then, Teach done what he done
and then the house got burnt.

279
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,848
lt was--
you know, it was terrible.

280
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,848
l was like a terrible 'mistake
that I made.

281
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,487
l was tragic and it was
a long time ago

282
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,123
and l've paid-- l've paid...

283
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,622
with a Iot of hard time.

284
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,785
And l just think, you know,
l'm so ready to be out

285
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,988
and start my life again,

286
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,429
and well, so what--

287
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,865
you know, what-what-what
can we do to make that happen?

288
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,470
How can you help 'me
make that happen?

289
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,970
Well, we'll see.

290
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,473
We were just getting started, so--

291
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,806
A Iot of good things have
happened for 'me in here, you know.

292
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,675

299
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,661
No no, not your job.

352
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,657

469
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,995
( beeps )

470
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,136
Shit.

471
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,602

472
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,139
Who goes to sleep at 9:00

473
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,154

474
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,274
Lucetta: Mr. Mabry

475
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,682

00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,189

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,351

00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,732
You're here to see your husband

480
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,698
No, silly, l'm here to see you.

481
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,839
Wait, l''m sorry,

482
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,874
Oh yeah, okay. WelI, there's a way
to 'meet with fa'mily, Mrs. Creeson.

483
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,478
You have to go through the office
for 'me to see you.

484
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,206
- Oh right.

00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,079

486
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,720
- That's-that's how we--

487
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,221
because, l 'mean,

00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,051

489
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,562
Lucetta. Just caII the office

490
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,326

- No, we can't.
- Please please.

493
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,503
You know how 'much
this means to us.

494
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,007
lf you're coming to see your husband,
fine, but we can't do it any other way.

495
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,373
And l'm late, really.

496
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,572
Well, Mr. Mabry,

497
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,910
Mr. Mabry, l wanted
to give you a little something

498
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,076
- 'my kids 'made in class.
- Yeah, l can't accept that.

499
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,052
- lt's inappropriate. Thank you anyway.
- But it's for the birds, see?

500
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,192
And they-- it's a nest
and they come and they take their twine

501
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,420
and their twigs and stuff
and they 'make their little ho'me.

502
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,029
Thank you.

503
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,359
Lucetta: Okay.

504
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,059
- Nice to 'meet you.
- Thank you.

505
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,810
Okay.

506
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,377
What the helI is this

507
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,611
- What's that?
- This-- your wife.

508
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,981
What, she sent it to you

509
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,282
She gave it to me
in the parking lot just now.

510
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,483
Wait, what,
Lucetta come and find you?

511
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,652
She gave that to me in the parking lot.
Don't mess with me.

512
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,094
I ain't Iookin' for any kind
of trouble with you, you know.

513
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,130
l hope you didn't put her up to it.

514
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,428
The parole board's
gonna send you a flop in the mail

515
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,127
and you won't even see them.

516
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,933
Lucetta does whatever
the fuck she wants. l told you, man.

517
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,667
She's just boisterous.

518
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,839
Jesus, what a week.

519
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,026
( phone ringing in adjacent room )

520
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,688
Hey hey, l want to see
what you think about something.

521
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,167
You ever-- you seen this

522
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,196
l found it in the library.

523
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,208
''Zukangor, The Sound and Life God.''

524
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,868
Yeah, you know it

525
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,345
No.

526
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,848
They say the sound part come first.

527
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,543
They say the-- when you experience

528
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,053
a spiritual truth

529
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,192
that it co'mes to you as a sound,

530
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,624
that it goes through you,

531
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,958
changes your vibration,
gets you back into harmony.

532
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,498
Like God's tuning fork or something.

533
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,136
And then if you let that happen to you,

534
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,829
then-- then you get the light,

535
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,407
or you get illu'mination
or something.

536
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,402
l wouldn"t know about that.
I'm an EpiscopaIian.

537
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,516
They say it starts with s'mall things,
like little sounds, little vibrations,

538
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,551
like a--just like
a buzzing electric light

539
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,156
or rushing water
or the sound of a bee or...

540
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,189
- Yeah
- Yeah.

541
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,883
And then it grows.

542
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,189
But there's no priest or nothing.
lt's not Iike a religion.

543
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:30,733
There's just this one dude
named ArnoId who's the Zukmaster.

544
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,394
They say you do this practice
alI by yourself.

545
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,837
You can-- you can hear better.

546
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,738
You can hear God
speaking to you through sounds.

547
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,401
What's the practice

548
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,775
- They chant ''Hue.''
- Hue

549
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,077
- And then they listen.
- For what, a bee?

550
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,411
Maybe, l don't know.

551
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,057
( phone ringing in adjacent room )

552
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,183
( chuckles )
But you know, the thing is

553
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,092
they say you got to keep coming back

554
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,029
until you pay for aIl your shit.

555
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,533
That you've got to fix it

556
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,935
over a Iot of lives, you know,
until you work it all out.

557
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,632
Well, what about this life?

558
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,439
What about answering for the things
that you've done in this life?

559
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,945
Shit, l know l have.

560
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,950
Have you

561
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,611
Yeah. Have you

562
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,397
Male pastor: This is
the body of Christ, given for you.

563
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,466
The body of Christ, given for you.

564
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,633
The body of Christ, given for you.

565
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,797
- Jack: l'll be right back.
- Pastor: Sure.

566
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,679
Here, you drive ho'me.

567
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,477
l''m going to talk to the pastor
a minute and then I'Il waIk.

568
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,313
Okay.

569
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,321
- ( 'men chattering )
- Man: Hey yo, foul, bitch!

570
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,119
Damn, that's a hard foul!

571
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,318
Yo, that's a foul!

572
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,837
( clears throat )

573
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,768
( chanting )
Hue...

574
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,965
( basketball game fading out )

575
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,674
( basketball game grows louder )

576
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,819
Man:
Man, you should've dunked it!

577
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,887
( loud chattering )

578
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,827
Jack: Okay, I've never
done this before, so--

579
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,833
well, l 'mean, l come to the...

580
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,301
church every week and l really try.

581
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,467
And l don't know, l 'mean,
I guess l had hoped with time

582
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,670
it would be easier and easier and...

583
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,907
and l'd be...

584
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,677
My family, people close to me,

585
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,018
it see'ms to co'me to them easily,
but for me it's...

586
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,717
l 'mean l"ve...

587
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,384
l don't know.

588
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,061
l 'mean l"ve...

589
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,069
so'meti'mes
the thoughts that I have,

590
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,070
feelings...

591
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,235
but, uh, so'meti'mes

592
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,347
l just think 'maybe
you shouId shoot me or something.

593
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,416
Well, l don't believe that
that's what God wants for you.

594
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,349
Well, what does he want?

595
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,787
I wish l had a simple answer for you.

596
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,689
I'm not sure what God wants for you.

597
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,291
ls there anything...

598
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,528
There's an old Biblical passage
that says...

599
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,602
''Be stiII and know that l am God.''

600
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,573
Which is a way of saying

601
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,144
sometimes God does, u'm,

602
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,544
speak to us in 'mysterious ways.

603
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,314
( chattering )

604
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,724
( 'meditative humming )

605
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,958
Guard: Off the rail!

606
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,967

607
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,415

Hello

Lucetta: Hi, this is Lucetta Creeson.

611
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,432
Madylyn: l''m sorry,

00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,795
''ln what recent circu'mstance
was l aware of God's leading''

770
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,232
Why don't you say the bIessing

771
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,299
Yeah.

772
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,033
Blessed O Lord...

773
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,906
( clears throat )

774
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,138
blessed O Lord,

775
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:55,843
this food to our use,
and us to Thy loving service,

776
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,887
and...

777
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,923
make us mindful
of the needs of others...

778
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,054
- ln Christ's name, Amen.
- Amen.

779
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,766
You Iose your pIace

780
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,905
( chuckles )

781
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,937
( spoon clangs )

782
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,268
You want an egg

783
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,549
( chattering )

784
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,231
( chattering fades )

785
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,986
Male radio host: Sin comes
naturally to us fro'm our birth.

786
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,928
We-we-- it's inbred in us.

787
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:20,127
We are not sinners
because we sin;

788
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,796
we sin because we are sinners.

789
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,138
Even if you Iived a life
of perfect righteousness,

790
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,109
you deserve hell.
You know why?

791
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,613
Because ''alI of our
righteousnesses,'' lsaiah says,

792
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,308
''are as filthy rags.''

793
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,454
( turns off car, radio )

794
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,133
( panting )

795
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,634
You're real sweet, Jack.

796
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,737
You're real sweet.

797
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,410
Fuck me harder.

798
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,746
( 'man laughing )

799
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,287
You're good, Jack.

800
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,117
You're a good 'man
for helping us.

801
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,420
l appreciate it.

802
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,095
You know that
nobody can know about this.

803
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,934
You know that, right

804
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,598
l 'mean nobody.

805
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,768
That's very important.

806
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:46,075
Whatever you want,
it'll alI go bad if anybody knows.

807
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,276
Bad for everybody,
you understand that?

808
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,284
Of course, silly.

809
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,497
What's wrong
You're not eating?

810
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,330
You ever think about things
they say go on forever?

811
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,169
What

812
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,005
Things they say
go on forever-- Iike...

813
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,941
what's that mean, you know

814
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:58,180
The sky, like, they say
the sky goes on forever.

815
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,821
But what is that really? That's--

816
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:05,519
l 'mean, you can't see
nothing you can't see, so...

817
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,362
it's like a big bowl
of blue above you.

818
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,296
You can see clouds
during the day

819
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,402
or you can see stars
at night maybe,

820
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,061
but even with a telescope
you can't see forever.

821
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,969
So how do they know

822
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,335
Know what

823
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,503
What it is.

824
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,013
Eternity-- how do they know

825
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,720
So-- so, Jack,

826
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,695
he said the board's gonna review
the whole thing, okay?

827
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,231
And they're going
to take into consideration

828
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,598
your age and, you know,

829
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,672
your 'mo'm and all that,

830
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:54,572
and the fact that
you were an addict back then, u'm...

831
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,942
- hey, Stoney baby
- H'm'm?

832
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,243
Look at 'me.

833
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,290
Well, l was trying to tell you
about your parole.

834
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,391
Yeah

835
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,550
( sighs )

836
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,255
Well, you weren't listening.

837
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,959
Oh yeah, l'm listening.

838
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,696
l am.

839
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:25,103
Okay, so Jack said, um--

840
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,072
You calI him Jack

841
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:28,768
Sure.

842
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,611
That's good.
What's he say?

843
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,950
Okay, so, um,
he's gonna talk to you

844
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,646
and he's going over
the whoIe thing

845
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,487
and he's gonna decide in a few days
to write up his notes in your case file

846
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,459
to sub'mit it to the parole co'm'mission
so when they go over it next week

847
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,724
they're gonna see it.
Isn't that great, baby?

848
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,961
Honey, this could be it.
Isn't that great

849
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,505
Yeah.

850
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,148
Didn't-didn't-didn't I do good

851
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,782
Well, look at 'me.

852
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,618
( Stone groans )

853
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,492
What are you doing

854
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,756
Sometimes l think the best thing is...

855
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,860
is just-just listen.

856
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,944
Would you stop playin'

857
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,610
Radio: Is the kingdom of heav-- you
think it should be a peaceful kingdom

858
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:42,513
- and we shouId alI get along
- That's great, but is it just going

859
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,950
- to be a constant struggle...
- That's a tough one.

860
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:47,113
...to have the kingdom of heaven
here on earth

861
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,850
( overlapping radio broadcasts )

862
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,863
Guard: Crack 53!

863
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,805
Just tell 'me,
is it the 30th or the 31st

864
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,375
I've had about enough lip from you!

865
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,909
God damn it, just tell me,
which one is it?

866
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,547
You can button that up right now
and be nice. And I mean it.

867
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,490
Creeson's here.

868
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,058
Stone: How do ask a person to...

869
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,718
to explain something that--

870
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,092
that they experienced

871
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:30,927
to where another person's got no way

872
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,662
to relate to the whole
indefiniteness of it, you know?

873
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,269
You don't believe 'me
aIready, do you?

874
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,535
l''m not saying l don"t believe you.
l just, you know, l--

875
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,405
look, l've seen the tape,
it's quite a thing.

876
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,242
But nothing happened to you.
I mean, you weren't involved in any way.

877
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,908
Yeah, look, l don't know how to even--

878
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:54,217
- ( phones ringing in distance )
- l'm not--

879
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,416
l don"t know. l--

880
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,618
You had, what, a profound

881
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,958
spiritual epiphany.

882
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,692
Shit, man, l ain't never even
heard that word before.

883
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,359
Look, we don't have to talk about it.

884
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,630
You know, it really don't matter.

885
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,774
Well...

886
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,105
l 'mean, don"t get 'me wrong, l'd
Iike to beIieve in such things, but--

887
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,041
Like what Like me
You believe in me?

888
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:20,479
Sure, l'd like to believe in you too.
l 'mean that's why we're all here, right?

889
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,284
Wow.

890
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:32,153
Okay, you know, wait, look,

891
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,263
there were something like...

892
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,058
it was just a moment.

893
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,226
The static,

894
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,803
it just alI went away, you know

895
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,304
And l could really hear,

896
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,965
like l could hear clear, for real.

897
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:51,012
l don"t know. lt just 'made 'me
see everything different.

898
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,480
lt 'made 'me look
at my life in a different way.

899
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,142
It was just aIl of a sudden
l could-- l could see that

900
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,188
my life in here isn't empty and
pointless like l thought it was before.

901
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,449
Wo'man: Family and...

902
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,528
- Look, Stone, just drop it.
- Drop what?

903
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,293
Well, l know what
you're trying to do, but don't.

904
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,496
Just-just-just don't.
It's not helping. Just stop.

905
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,834
Hey look, man,

906
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,500
it don't matter to 'me no more.

907
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,112
- What doesn't matter
- l don't care about what--

908
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:27,375
what you're doin" or what anybody else
is tryin' to make you do.

909
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:31,009
Make me do What's that
Nobody's trying to 'make 'me do anything.

910
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,521
Okay.

911
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:40,062
You should do what
you think is right, okay?

912
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,165
l a'm whatever you say I a'm in there,

913
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,632
Seriously. l mean it.

914
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,828
- WelI...

915
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,870
l want to be out,

916
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,874
but l''m gonna wrestle
with the same shit if l'm out.

917
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,706
And l''m gonna keep
this feeling if l'm in.

918
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,809
Jack:
So you're all good now?

919
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,921
Stone: No no no. Look, I ain't sayin'
l''m all happy all of a sudden.

920
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,421
You know, my middIe finger's
been up a long ti'me, 'man.

921
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:11,561
l''m not just gonna start wavin'
and smiIin' at people.

922
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,720
l'm gonna pop off.
l''m gonna lose 'my te'mper, and--

923
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,061
and say shit and do shit
that l'm gonna regret, whatever.

924
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:21,068
l just-- l just--
I am who l am, you know?

925
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,401
And that"s okay.
You know what l'm sayin'?

926
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,940
Jack:
No. No, l''m afraid l don't.

927
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,772
Stone: WelI, I told you
l couldn't explain it really.

928
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,039
- MadyIyn: Are you okay
- Yeah. My back.

929
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,945
- l''m gonna go sleep in the other roo'm.
- Oh.

930
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,586
Male radio host:
You can take great comfort in that,

931
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,517
but that can be a false comfort.

932
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,590
Sometimes in the twilight
of a civilization,

933
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,023
there can be a great
cultural flowering,

934
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:48,687
but in reality, there are cracks
in the foundation of that society

935
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,298
and that society is doomed.

936
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,321
lf you really want to know,

937
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:17,949
l think it's some kind of
play-acting or so'mething.

938
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,755
lt's aIl bulIshit

939
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:24,127
No. No. Look, Stoney's just...

940
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,098
you know.
I mean, he's screwed up.

941
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,635
He's got weird ideas about things.

942
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,467
Sometimes really weird.

943
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,610
But, l 'mean,
he's always been that way.

944
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:38,475
Jack: Talkin' to hi'm,

945
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,513
he almost seemed like...

946
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,652
Like what

947
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,255
Something-- realIy,
l don't know. Different.

948
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:49,358
( chuckles )
No.

949
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:53,485
Look, he's just trying
to impress you, you know,

950
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,154
trying to do whatever
it takes to get out.

951
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,324
Can you blame him

952
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,765
- No, it's okay.
- What

953
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,703
Hey, sit down.

954
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,535
Come on. Come on, sit down.

955
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,371
Sit down.

956
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,807
Look, he ad'mires you a lot,
you know.

957
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,715
He told 'me
he learned a lot taIking to you.

958
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,951
Can you be straight

959
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:27,028
Straight as you.

960
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,855
ls this all just a-- l 'mean,

961
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,695
just-just-just
telI me what's going on.

962
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,867
l don't do anything
I don't want to do.

963
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,202
l like you.

964
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,507
l like you, Jack.

965
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,314
I would never fuck you
if l didn't want to.

966
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,047
Well, thanks.

967
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,658
God, you're beautiful, you know.

968
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,491
You're beautifuI.

969
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,498
Thank you.

970
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,738
l''m not gonna
come over here anymore.

971
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,536
- You're not
- No.

972
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:15,837
Okay.

973
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,445
Maybe l should just take

974
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,276
so'me antidepressants
or something, I don't know.

975
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,920
- Yes you will.
- What?

976
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,715
lt's okay though.

977
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,915
l don't 'mind when they say,
''Oh no, no 'more,''

978
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,583
'cause then l just sit back and wait.

979
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,696
( chuckles )

980
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,627
But you'll call,

981
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,392
won't you, or drop by

982
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,628
Like 'maybe late again
some night, won't you?

983
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,932
Oh God.

984
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,466
Look, I don't care if you deny it.
lt's funny to 'me.

985
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,476
St-stop this now.

986
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:54,947
l think about you so 'much, Jack.
All day long l'm thinking about you.

987
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,949
l think about you at work.

988
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,213
Don't say that.

989
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,584
You're sexy, Jack,

990
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,385
and you know if you Iet Stone out,

991
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,120
we can still be friends too.
He won't know.

992
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,991
He won't even care.

993
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,962
Look, l do what l do
because l'm on my own, okay?

994
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,625
And l got to 'make my own way,
so don't you want to help us

995
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,465
- Don't you want to help me
- Don't talk like that.

996
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,130
l can't.
It's not that simple.

997
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,814
You can't leave, can you

998
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,145
lt's sweet.

999
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,151
What the helI am l doing
God damn it.

1000
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,196
Oh, come on, Jack.
He's a good 'man at heart.

1001
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,663
You really beIieve that

1002
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,927
Yeah, l do.

1003
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,333
No different than you and me.

1004
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,097
Do you go to church

1005
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:55,711
Hell no.
There's no such thing as God.

1006
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,018
( dialing )

1007
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,663
They called again.
They need the Creeson report.

1008
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,196
l just sent it!

1009
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,926
You don't have to yell.
l'm on the intercom.

1010
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,594
You got your RGC recommendation.

1011
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,764
Vocational counseling,

1012
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:02,571
psych therapy,
GED, NA, NA program.

1013
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,509
So the board needs to decide

1014
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:08,207
if it's safe to Iet you back
into the world,

1015
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,443
that you're not a danger
to yourself or others.

1016
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,713
RehabiIitated, right

1017
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,379
Yeah.

1018
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,081
You know, in my book it says

1019
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:20,218
that chronic neck pain co'mes
from bein' hanged in another life.

1020
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:23,263
Well, it's 'my back.
lt's not my neck.

1021
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,765
Well, l''m just makin' conversation.

1022
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,228
Look, if you're
not interested in the details

1023
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:30,963
of your hearing, we're done here.

1024
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,801
- Done
- We're done.

1025
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:36,207
- How do you mean we're done
- My report's already sent. We're done.

1026
01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:42,283
Basically they want to hear that you
take responsibility for your actions.

1027
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,626
See, the thing about that,
l don't know.

1028
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,132
About what

1029
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:04,637
It's funny, you know, 'cause you're
always askin' 'me about that night--

1030
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,672
how it made me feeI.

1031
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,638
You know, when 'my cousin
come out of the house

1032
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,343
and got 'me
and we went back inside...

1033
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:22,154
it was trippy, 'man,
because like two minutes before,

1034
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,259
you know, 'my poppy,

1035
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:27,089
he was-- he was alive.
There was coIor in his face.

1036
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,128
There was light in his eyes.

1037
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,790
And then l go inside there and...

1038
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,598
and then l see the'm

1039
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,974
lyin" there all over everywhere.

1040
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:51,516
There was this buzzing
in my ears, you know,

1041
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,054
and l thought it was
just the shit that we was on,

1042
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,691
but it kept growin'

1043
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,453
and it started scarin'
the shit out of me.

1044
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,529
Teach was bouncin' off the walls,

1045
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,064
yellin' at 'me,
''We got to do something,

1046
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,326
You gotta help 'me.
We gotta handIe this.''

1047
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,562
But all l could hear
in my head was this sound.

1048
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:15,572
And then,
l don't know how l knew,

1049
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:19,545
but l just knew that
there needed to be a fire.

1050
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,684
l went to the garage.

1051
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,876
I got the can of gasoline

1052
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,714
and l got the match

1053
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,856
and l lit it.

1054
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,363
You ever seen a fire
take control?

1055
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:37,522
lt's so'methin', 'man.
It's alive.

1056
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,827
And I watched it

1057
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,766
take them up

1058
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,669
and start to change them.

1059
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,210
And the only thought
that came in my head

1060
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:54,749
was '"This is awesome.''

1061
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,782
Awesome

1062
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,921
Stone: Yeah.

1063
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,416
lt was

1064
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,583
truly awesome.

1065
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,726
Um, the thing is that

1066
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,927
l know l''m supposed to take
responsibility for my action,

1067
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,938
l know that l''m supposed
to feel guilty about it,

1068
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,544
but l never did.

1069
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,612
And l never knew why.

1070
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:29,645
But now l think
l can understand

1071
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,753
that it was just

1072
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,889
part of what was
supposed to happen

1073
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:37,253
in my life's journey,

1074
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,950
you know

1075
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,289
That was your decision--
you did that.

1076
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,829
No, l'm not sayin" l didn't.

1077
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,934
l''m saying that we're all
God's co-workers,

1078
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:47,933
and we don't even know it.

1079
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,935
Your cri'me
has nothin' to do with God.

1080
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,165

Your soul-- it started out

1178
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,424
as a 'mineral or a pebble,

1179
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,529
and then it was reincarnated
as a plant,

1180
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:45,428
then as a fish, birds,
animals and so on.

1181
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,626
You had to work
your way up to being a human.

1182
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,601
- ( flies buzzing )
- Know what it's been doing, your soul?

1183
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:53,571
- Jack: Hmm, what?
- lt's been paying off debts--

1184
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,267
past sins from past lives,

1185
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,778
reducing its burden
from one life to the next.

1186
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:08,789
Where'd you get that

1187
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,290
Junk mail.

1188
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,568
You know what I think

1189
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,500
l think we get this one Iife,
l do, and...

1190
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,408
you account
for what you've done in it.

1191
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,670
And if you don't,
you pay for it when you die.

1192
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,805
You don't think

What's wrong with you?
Why are you being like this?

1212
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,866
And what's wrong

your concerns, it's fine,

1231
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,805
or if you want to submit
additional evidence, that's okay too.

1232

But you know as well as l do
his fate's already been determined.

1233

lt's luck and quotas.

01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,283
Nothing l say

What

01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:24,375
Do you

1256
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:32,249
You read the 'meditation.

1257
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:47,896
''What request is on the top
of my prayer list for today

1258
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:52,029

How about you?

You lost your place again.

You have so'mething

You don't

01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,720
l can't even think
of what you'd want me to say.

1264
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,982
You want to talk about it, man?

1265
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,742
What's that

Look, l''m a little concerned
about you, man.

1269

You're see'ming

Yeah well, put your mind at ease.

1271

So that's it for us, huh?

You'd better be s'mart or you're

You ain't got to concern yourseIf

l know you don't believe in 'me,
but you don't believe in yourself.

1284
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,529
You don't believe in God.

1285
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,571
l don't think you feel that anything
is true inside of you.

1327
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,653
Radio host #1: Right now we enjoy
the Constitutional freedom

1328
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:16,696
to keep and bear ar'ms.
If that were ever infringed,

1329
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:21,268
if that were ever repealed
or just flat out violated and...

1330
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,894
Madylyn

1331
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:28,236
Radio host #1: As a Christian,
would we be within our rights,

1332
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,571
because Thomas Jefferson says

1333
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:34,273
these rights are inalienable
because they come from our creator...

1334
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:35,939
Madylyn

1335
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:38,245
...within our rights as Christians

1336
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,786
to revolt against the government

1337
01:27:40,956 --> 01:27:45,586
and its denial of those fundamental
Constitutional rights,

1338
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:49,959
or wouId a Christian
have to respond differently?

1339
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,357
- Some mail.
- Host #2: We would have to respond.

1340
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:56,265
And we as Christians
would have to rise up

1341
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,963
against any government that said

1342
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:02,133
we didn't have a right
to protect ourselves, because--

1343
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,709
l guess l would ask the question,

1344
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:06,575
why do they want
to take our guns away from us?

1345
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:37,334
( locks clicking )

1346

l like you, Jack.

1348
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,789
I would never fuck you
if l didn't want to.

1349
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,558
( Lucetta laughs )

1350
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,016

- l got to get to a phone.
- Where are you gonna go?

1357
01:31:04,993 --> 01:31:06,324
- What about Steve and HeIen
- No, they're away.

1358
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:08,462
- Well, what about David
- lt's too far. lt's too late.

1359
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,495
Ah!

1360
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:13,293
( Jack sobbing )
Look at this! Oh my G--

1361
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:17,438
Jack: Oh God.

1362
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:21,302
You motherfucker!

1363
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,910
God damn it. God damn it!

1364
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:25,341
- Don't say that.
- What

1365
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,504
Taking the Lord's na'me--
stop that.

1366
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,674
- Jesus, Madylyn, please.
- Stop it! l won't stand for it!

1367
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:32,581
What are you talking about,
for Christ's sakes

1368
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:35,154
This 'means so'mething to 'me.
It may not mean anything to you anymore,

1369
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,984
- but it 'means so'mething to 'me!
- Jesus, Madylyn,

1370
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,149
we just al'most
got incinerated in our sleep

1371
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,454
by some fucking nutjob
who l let out,

1372
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:43,995
and you're fucking bothering me
about 'my fucking language?

1373
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,292
- Nobody did this to us!
- Give me a fucking break!

1374
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:48,368
- Nobody did this to us.
- What!

1375
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:50,163
lt wasn't anybody.
lt was an act of God.

1376
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,636
l've got a pretty good
fucking idea who did this to us.

1377
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:55,503
This was an act of God.
l'm going to tell the firemen that.

1378
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,772
What are you talking about, Madylyn

1379
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:02,280
About the frayed wiring
in the kitchen wall.

1380
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,281
What are you talking about
What wire

1381
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,317
ln the kitchen wall.

1382
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:09,218
And the-- the base'ment.

1383
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:11,359
- What
- There are all those rag--

1384
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,188
rags down there,
all those oId rags.

1385
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,195
l'm gonna tell the'm to go down there.

1386
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,563
Why would you say that

1387
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:26,703
Because it's as good
a story as any.

1388
01:32:28,343 --> 01:32:31,506
( sirens blaring )

1389
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:10,350
Madylyn:
It's not that sunny out.

1390
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:12,281
Candace:
Everybody knows

1391
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:15,423
you can still get sunburned
on a cloudy day.

1392
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,863
Madylyn:
Ah, look at the barns.

1393
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:26,762
Remember that

1394
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,767
Not really.

1395
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:35,909
l don't know how you
stuck it out as Iong as you did.

1396
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,106
l think you"d have done this sooner.

1397
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:45,542
l al'most did once.

1398
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:49,756
So what happened

1399
01:34:00,068 --> 01:34:02,468
What happened

1400
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,402
Man:
He's free! Yeah! He's free!

1401
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:14,446
( laughs )
That's a free man there, huh?

1402
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,098
( soft conversation )

1403
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:37,970
( slurring ) You do not want to 'make it
a two-way conversation with them,

1404
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:42,166
because they have
nothing on their minds but--

1405
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,174
well, they 'may have
nothin' but time

1406
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,779
to just think about ways
to work on you

1407
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,779
and to get under your skin.

1408
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,009
You cannot make yourseIf
a person to the'm.

1409
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,347
Oh, believe me,
l've learned that lesson.

1410
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,190
Well, l 'mean,
they'll test you for sure.

1411
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,827
A good lookin' woman like you...

1412
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,863
Oh, Jack.

1413
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:08,025
Well, l''m--

1414
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,070
l"'m retired,
I'm not dead, you know.

1415
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:14,072
Come on, Jack, we're friends, okay
You're the best.

1416
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:16,210
l wanna have a littIe fun.

1417
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,141
Send me off into the sunset.

1418
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,912
Huh-uh.

1419
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,349
Let's just keep it pro, okay

1420
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:30,018
You want to be a pro

1421
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:33,524
Fuck pro. They're gonna fucking
chew your ass up in there.

1422
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:35,686
- Okay, Jack, that's enough.
- No no, it's bullshit.

1423
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,058
Jerking 'my chain like that,
you fucking cunt.

1424
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:41,327
- Gimme some respect.
- Hey, buddy, let's throw so'me darts.

1425
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:43,163
Yeah yeah, l"m in.

1426
01:35:43,338 --> 01:35:46,102
- Up yours.
- Whoa whoa whoa, buddy, hey.

1427
01:35:46,274 --> 01:35:49,539
Jack:
I'm just fucked up. l should go.

1428
01:35:49,711 --> 01:35:52,737
- No, ride with 'me.
- No, l'm-l'm gonna get a cab.

1429
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,677
l''m good, l''m good.
I'm gonna get a cab.

1430
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:58,751
l'm good, word of honor.
l''m good. lt's a cab.

1431
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,189
Radio: ...get us to the reality
that God has already deemed

1432
01:36:03,358 --> 01:36:06,418
is going to happen,
and nothing is going to change that.

1433
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:09,461
And so it's not like
there is this cosmic battle

1434
01:36:09,631 --> 01:36:11,758
between good and evil,

1435
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,265
and good 'might not triu'mph.

1436
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,926
The reality is that
there is a battle going on

1437
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:20,632
where you wouId see
a huge boxer

1438
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:22,469
holding a guy"s head back,

1439
01:36:22,644 --> 01:36:25,772
and the little scrawny guy
is flaiIing his arms,

1440
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:28,381
waving at the guy,
trying to beat him.

1441
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:31,882
That's exactly what God--
God has Satan subdued,

1442
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:33,953
but in the flaiIing of his arms--

1443
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:37,216
and this is particularly brought out
in Revelation, chapter 12--

1444
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:41,886
Satan flailing his arms
is able to do an awful lot of chaos

1445
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:44,623
and damage and bad things happen.

1446
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,994
And it's because he is enraged

1447
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:49,068
because he knows his ti'me is short.

1448
01:36:49,237 --> 01:36:50,636
Revelation 12 said that.

1449
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,739
Jack: Hey!

1450
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:07,151
Stone:
This is so'me shit, 'man.

1451
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:08,653
Wait whoa!

1452
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:12,092
You ruined my whole life. Why

1453
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,252
Fucking why Why

1454
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,193
Why what

1455
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:19,162
Why did you do it

1456
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,499
Why did you...

1457
01:37:28,543 --> 01:37:31,034
Okay okay okay okay.

1458
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:34,381
Hey, 'man,

1459
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,176
you ain't gonna do this.

1460
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,550
You think l won't

1461
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,321
You think l won't
( chuckles )

1462
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:50,525
You think l won't

1463
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,723
You think l won't!

1464
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:07,872
No.

1465
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,715
No, l don't.

1466
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:41,412
Wo'man on radio:
Yeah, at first, l thought l was crazy.

1467
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:43,607
Was this really happening to me

1468
01:38:43,785 --> 01:38:46,583
Was it all in 'my head,
or is there really a God

1469
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,086
who can breathe Iife into me

1470
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:51,521
and make me feel his presence

1471
01:38:51,692 --> 01:38:55,253
So this is actually what
encouraged 'me to write the book.

1472
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:59,025
And honestly it co'mpletely changed
the way that l look at life...

1473
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,760
Man on radio:
Assume that there was a Higher Power,

1474
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,563
that lt created the universe,

1475
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:06,798
until God set a bush on fire...

1476
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,635
Man in roo'm:
And maybe l did.

1477
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,937
Man on radio: ...and said,
''Oh, by the way, you were right.''

1478
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:14,548
( overlapping radio and dialogue )

1479
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:18,115
( laughs )

1480
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,949
You know, and...

1481
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,992
l think-- l think l'm ready to get out.

1482
01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:30,756
Male radio host: Next up here is
GeraId from southwest Detroit.

1483
01:39:30,932 --> 01:39:33,162
- Welcome, Gerald.
- Stone: l just want to say,

1484
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:35,825
l got this book and they say that

1485
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:38,767
when you experience a spiritual truth,

1486
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,908
that it co'mes to you through sound.

1487
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:44,238
If you let this sound go through you,

1488
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:47,472
it changes you, you know

1489
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:50,310
lt puts you back into harmony,

1490
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:54,285
you know, 'makes you
Iike a tuning fork of God.

1491
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:55,820
Host: Okay.

1492
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,959
Stone: Yeah, they say--
they say it can start with s'mall things

1493
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:02,459
like little vibrations--
you know, the sound of a bee,

1494
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:05,155
the sound of a buzzing light--
and then it grows.

1495
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,597
Host:
All right, that's interesting.

1496
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:09,827
Stone: WeIl, they say

1497
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,438
that everything that happens to you

1498
01:40:12,607 --> 01:40:16,168
is what was supposed
to happen to you for you to advance,

1499
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:18,869
that you've got to
come back lots of times,

1500
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:22,209
you know, cycle through 'many lives
until you learn, untiI you...

1501
01:40:23,618 --> 01:40:25,609
Male radio host:
Well, thanks for your input.

1502
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:29,017
Next up here
on the WDDL Iistener Iine is

1503
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:32,523

You're on All Voices Under God.

1504
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:35,457
( radio broadcast fades out )

1505
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:51,309
( bee buzzing )

1506
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,658
( bee buzzing )

01:41:08,763 --> 01:41:10,492
