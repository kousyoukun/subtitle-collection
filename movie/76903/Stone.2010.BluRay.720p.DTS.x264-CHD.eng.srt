1
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,834
It was a very short putt.

2
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,192
It would seem routine had

3
00:00:32,193 --> 00:00:34,343
he not just come off a bogey the hole before.

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,744
Mm-hmm, obviously smarting from that.

5
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,886
But let's see what he does here.

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,988
Oh perfect. Textbook, textbook.

7
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,182
We move ahead now to Lee Trevino on the fairway at the seventh.

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,726
His lie looks as though he may be in a little divot.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,388
Absolutely. Tournament officials have been cracking down

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,398
on caddies filling in the divots.

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,657
At this level of the game,

12
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,561
some of us gotta watch the etiquette of golf.

13
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,949
Just go to sleep.

14
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,775
A lovely approach.

15
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,078
He's considering it now. I presume that a player like...

16
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,346
Sand wedge or intermediate pitching wedge.

17
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,109
Oh, very exciting. He's lining up the shot.

18
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,287
Look at me.

19
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,423
Hmm?

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,121
I'm not standing for this.

21
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,266
Sorry?

22
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,363
You keep my soul in a dungeon.

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
I'm leaving.

24
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,012
Jack?

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,329
- Jack. - If you leave me, I'll throw her.

26
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,966
You think that I won't, hmm?

27
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,335
- Please. - Do you think I won't?!

28
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,799
I won't leave. I won't leave you.

29
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,756
I'm sorry. Don't ever do that again.

30
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,557
Don't ever leave me. Don't ever do that again.

31
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,009
All things bright and beautiful.

32
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,381
All creatures great and small.

33
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,422
All things wise and wonderful.

34
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,359
The Lord God made them all.

35
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,555
I invite you to be seated at this time.

36
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,200
Oh, that's a very nice touch.

37
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,639
So maybe he can make a par. And at worse from there

38
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,437
you'd think he could stay his point total.

39
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,377
Now here we find him with a 7-iron at this par-3 hole.

40
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,270
I don't know if there was a problem with him slippin' with

41
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,258
his right foot there, but definitely a pull.

42
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,120
He obviously had the thought in his head

43
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,955
that he needed to give it a little bit extra,

44
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,427
and he's found himself in a difficult spot.

45
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,658
All the expectations he had coming into this,

46
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,939
- Hello? - Jack.

47
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,807
Betsy.

48
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,607
Your brother slipped away.

49
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,320
Finally out of his misery.

50
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,683
- Yes, he is. - Oh, I know, I know.

51
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,135
And how many times did I hear,

52
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:14,985
"Why can't you be like your brother Bobby"?

53
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,527
If I had a nickel for every time that was said to me...

54
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,626
I'd be a rich man today.

55
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,168
That scar on his forehead that he had,

56
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,205
he always had a story for it,

57
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,415
but it was me.

58
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,673
I threw a hammer at Mr. Perfect when I was eight.

59
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,042
He never told though. He covered for the people he loved.

60
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,515
That's how he was and I loved him for that.

61
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,154
And I wanted to be like him.

62
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,051
Everything-

63
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,362
I just want to say that...

64
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,172
If it wasn't for Bobby, I'd...

65
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,005
I- I don't know...

66
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,514
Where I would've wound up.

67
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,213
He taught me how to live, what was right.

68
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,182
I'm gonna miss him.

69
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,592
He lived right. He lived right. He was...

70
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:30,565
What more could you s- want people to say about you?

71
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,671
All throughout Scripture it talks about God being a just God.

72
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,946
I mean, I just read the parable

73
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,677
about the unjust judge,

74
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,749
where the woman kept coming and coming and saying...

75
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,079
Caring, loving, forgiving...

76
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,915
I'm wondering if you concur with what you've heard so far?

77
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,956
I think that the choices, the idea of free will,

78
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,060
and the fact that we have freedom of choice...

79
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,101
The reality of the times we live in,

80
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,190
this notion that- this angst

81
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,736
that a lot of people are feeling in this country,

82
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,145
that we've gone through some sort of fundamental transformation...

83
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,927
"Barack Obama earlier today,

84
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,222
crediting his so-called stimulus package

85
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,618
that he signed four or five months ago,

86
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,784
as "Putting cash into the pockets of taxpayers. "

87
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,954
If you're a taxpayer in the Detroit area

88
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,565
who got cash in your pocket from the stimulus plan,

89
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,545
I'd love to hear from ya,

90
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:37,963
and you can also check in via the internet,

91
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,967
but we would love to hear from you personally.

92
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,346
Kevin in Warren. We go to Kevin.

93
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:42,606
Kevin thanks so much for calling.

94
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,070
Welcome.

95
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,078
Hi, Pam.

96
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,021
Thanks.

97
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,157
No, it's true.

98
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,058
With God is my witness, I've changed.

99
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,495
With Jesus and my family...

100
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,857
Oh my God, I'm sorry for what I've done.

101
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,892
I mean, I robbed a goddamn liquor store with a toy gun.

102
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,054
What kinda- what kinda idiot does that?

103
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,783
Warden wants to see you.

104
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,556
Hi, Allie.

105
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,859
- Hi, Mitch. Janice. - Jack.

106
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,264
- What's up? - Shut the door, Jack.

107
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,239
This Deshawn Mackey guy.

108
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,347
This is yours? Your report, right?

109
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

110
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,812
It's an incompetent mess, Jack.

111
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,788
I mean, look, I know your head's already out on the golf course,

112
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,157
but this is a travesty of proper casework here.

113
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,262
- I got ya. - You got me.

114
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,309
Here. Learn from the master of understatement.

115
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,946
- Absolutely. - Keep 'em brief.

116
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,411
Now I need to get Janice

117
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,811
up to speed before you're out the back door,

118
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,352
so let's pass all your indeterminates eligible off to her.

119
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,753
Yeah yeah, of course, but I'd like to stay on my currents,

120
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,985
if I can see them through to review- is that okay?

121
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,761
Yeah, if you're willing.

122
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,365
- I would like to. Thank you. - Yeah.

123
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,968
- We're good. - Okay.

124
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,196
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

125
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,965
Excuse me?

126
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,370
Your brother- I just recently heard, I'm sorry.

127
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,307
Thank you.

128
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,145
- Okay. - Yeah.

129
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,048
S- Stone.

130
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,153
Hmm?

131
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,050
No, I-I'm Stone.

132
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,215
I mean, I know it say "Gerald" In the file,

133
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,328
but I'm just saying I prefer Stone.

134
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,732
Gerald Creeson.

135
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,397
So what's Stone, like a nickname?

136
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,227
That's something from here?

137
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,096
No. Oh no, man. Fuck ail these assholes.

138
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,569
Yo, that's what my people call me. You know, people who know me.

139
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,007
Look, are we just gonna,

140
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,070
like- are you just gonna tick the boxes and shit?

141
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,681
I mean, can we- can we talk straight?

142
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,481
I mean, you gonna help me out or what?

143
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,909
'Cause I, you know, I don't think

144
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,131
I deserve to be up in here no more.

145
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,247
Let's just slow down. Slow slow down.

146
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,719
I've done a long bid, man. Three more years ain't gonna-

147
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,757
Slow down. Let's - let's talk about what got you here.

148
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,809
You want to tell me about that?

149
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,758
It's right there in front of you.

150
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,422
Why you want to talk about that again?

151
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,363
'Cause now you're mine.

152
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,260
You moved up.

153
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,423
And just 'cause I like to chat.

154
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,673
All these scrubs in here,

155
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,537
you know, these short-timers and meatballs,

156
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,900
they're like, they're all innocent, right?

157
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,702
Yeah. But at least I admit it.

158
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,708
You know, I copped to what I did right away,

159
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,143
and-and now I'm lookin' forward, man.

160
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,283
I got a job lined up and I'm sayin',

161
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,544
why I got to talk about that shit every fuckin' time?

162
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,449
'Cause I want to hear your side of it, that's why.

163
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,453
You know what? Just fuck this shit. Fuck you too.

164
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,888
- I ain't got time for this bullshit. - Hey, son-

165
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,426
No, you're just settin' them up so they can flop me, man.

166
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,655
So you write what you're gonna write and let's just get on with it, man.

167
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,765
- 'Cause I'll take the flop. - Hey, son. Stone.

168
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,298
- Go ahead, max me, max me. - Son, calm down.

169
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,402
You don't think I'll do it, I'll see that max standing

170
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,662
- on my fucking head, man. - Stone!

171
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,464
I'll see you outside before you see me, bitch.

172
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,774
Stone!

173
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,425
In about two fucking seconds you're gonna go in the hole,

174
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,575
and your file is gonna go to the bottom of my pile.

175
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,476
You understand? You see that door in front of you?

176
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,947
You know where it goes- back.

177
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,017
You want to go back? Be my guest.

178
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,655
You want to go forward, you want to walk out of here,

179
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,189
you want to find that door? Me, I'm that door.

180
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,513
And you will go through me.

181
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,328
If I ask you a question about the weather,

182
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,532
you better fucking answer it

183
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,464
or go back and I'll see you in three years.

184
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,997
- You got it? - Yeah.

185
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,761
- Then sit the fuck down. - All right.

186
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,303
Well, we just shootin' the shit.

187
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,511
I like her, man. She's hard.

188
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,318
Okay. All right, look,

189
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,685
look, this is a process.

190
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,849
We talk.

191
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,553
We're not friends, but just pretend we're friends, okay?

192
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,858
Relax, just-just talk, that's all,

193
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,524
and then maybe we both get what we want, okay?

194
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,035
- Okay, let's pretend. - Okay.

195
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,867
You're married.

196
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,031
Yeah.

197
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,836
Okay, that's good.

198
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,376
How long are you married?

199
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,572
Nine years, man- eight of it up in this shit.

200
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,514
It's right in the file, man. I don't want-

201
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,355
Let's talk about your wife.

202
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,752
- Lucetta? - Mm-hmm, yeah.

203
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,824
- Has she come up here? You seen her? - No.

204
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,656
- She's a dime, dawg. - What's a dime?

205
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,820
Perfect 10, man. She's fine.

206
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,400
I'll tell you, between you and me,

207
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,400
she's-she's a alien.

208
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,232
Alien? What do you mean, like an illegal?

209
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,069
No, she ain't illegal, man. She's whiter than you.

210
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,336
No, she's like- she's like a-

211
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,912
she's an alien from another world, man.

212
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,884
She visit you much? Picnics most Saturdays?

213
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,114
I don't want no picnic, man. I miss my dick in her fuckin' ass.

214
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,589
You know, I miss her suckin' me till I can't take no more.

215
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,524
I mean, she's crazy. She'll do anything.

216
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,977
Fuck her tits, come in her face,

217
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,756
she'll just blink and keep on laughing, man.

218
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,366
It's- she-

219
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,949
look, if we gonna talk about Lucetta,

220
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,764
you better watch out,

221
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,598
'cause I'm gonna give you some pictures in your head

222
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,740
gonna keep you up nights, man.

223
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,143
Oh man.

224
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,443
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I- I got a mouth, I know.

225
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,609
I apologize, man. You're givin' me that look,

226
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,484
and I feel like you go down here and that's the end of this shit.

227
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,626
Look, I don't want no beef with you.

228
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,658
I just want to be vegetarian.

229
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,468
Is that your wife? You're married?

230
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,334
Yeah.

231
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,338
- A long time? - 43 years.

232
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,670
Get the fuck out.

233
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,313
Man, that's true love, huh?

234
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,293
That's great, and after 43 years

235
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,313
and you still get it on and everything?

236
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,817
- Excuse me? - No, I'm really curious about this.

237
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,818
It's like, say, I love my lady, right,

238
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,423
but, you know, I wonder sometimes,

239
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,084
like how you gonna do when the skin starts to go to the crepe,

240
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,866
you know what I'm sayin'? I mean,

241
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,629
what do- how does that work for you?

242
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,428
Like you get hip to Viagra, so you can like hammer nails with it?

243
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,220
Listen listen, look, I don't

244
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,664
talk with anybody about my wife like that.

245
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,672
I ain't talkin' about your wife. I'm sayin', for me,

246
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,674
you know, I've been locked up a long time.

247
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,817
You don't need much more

248
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,541
than two pumps and a swirl to get it done.

249
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,148
I don't consider this polite conversation.

250
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,116
I ain't tryin' to be rude, okay? I really want to know

251
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,277
where does that go?

252
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,890
Or where do you put it, if you-

253
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,719
you get what I'm sayin'?

254
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,328
I want to know how it works for you,

255
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,054
how you keep a lid on that.

256
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,393
We're not- we're not talking about me.

257
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,366
We're not talking about me, okay?

258
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,329
Man looks on the outward appearance.

259
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,736
God looks on the heart.

260
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,242
And certainly the heart of a man does matter,

261
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,710
because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks...

262
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,700
Only in the choices that God decides to present to us.

263
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,236
Well, no, I'm not saying that.

264
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,740
I'm saying that I just believe that we're automatons...

265
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,532
...and here's the deal:

266
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,370
- I did not choose to be born... - This is very very serious.

267
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,706
...and I cannot choose to be born again.

268
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,109
She's four- can you believe it?

269
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,808
I had no choice in that matter whatsoever, and yet

270
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,284
- there are so many people that... - Where have you gone?

271
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,286
...think they have a choice in the matter

272
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,949
of their spiritual rebirth and their spiritual formation.

273
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,681
The fact of the matter is,

274
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,393
a seed is planted and conception takes place,

275
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,760
- which you had nothing to do with. - Amen.

276
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,129
All Voices Under God, WDDL,

277
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,829
will continue here right after these very important messages.

278
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,644
Look, we was high as shit and we were lookin' for money.

279
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,676
You know? My poppy hears us.

280
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,314
Him and Teach have words.

281
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,972
Poppy goes and gets his gun.

282
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,175
And I was like, "Fuck this. I don't want no part of this,"

283
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,978
and I went outside.

284
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,022
So then, Teach done what he done and then the house got burnt.

285
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,860
It was- you know, it was terrible.

286
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,860
I was like a terrible mistake that I made.

287
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,499
I was tragic and it was a long time ago

288
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,135
and I've paid- I've paid...

289
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,634
With a lot of hard time.

290
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,797
And I just think, you know, I'm so ready to be out

291
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,000
and start my life again,

292
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,441
and well, so what-

293
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,877
you know, what-what-what can we do to make that happen?

294
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,482
How can you help me make that happen?

295
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,982
Well, we'll see.

296
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,485
We were just getting started, so-

297
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,817
A lot of good things have happened for me in here, you know.

298
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,687
I did my GED like that, man.

299
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,885
I held down this job- Textiles Unit,

300
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,826
number one position the last two years.

301
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm goin' home to my wife.

302
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,557
She's got a spot for me, you know,

303
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,506
Mount Elliot Chrysler,

304
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:52,007
job lined up.

305
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,506
I'm-I'm going, you know.

306
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:54,834
Yeah, whose idea was it?

307
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,879
Lucetta- she knows

308
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,133
the branch manager at Mount Elliot.

309
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,673
No no, not your job.

310
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,209
Whose idea was it to go to your grandparent's?

311
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,903
- What? - Whose idea was it?

312
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,043
I told you- I told you it was Teach.

313
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,745
Teach, you know.

314
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,391
Like I said, I wasn't even...

315
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,754
I was...I went outside the house.

316
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,055
Yeah, but you didn't stop them, did you?

317
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,824
- Stop 'em what? - From killing your grandparents.

318
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,001
You-you-you ain't gonna do it, man.

319
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,534
You're not gonna-

320
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,406
You don't give a fuck, man. Shit.

321
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,116
I was outside,

322
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,447
Teach...Teach come out,

323
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,023
and I didn't even know what he'd done until he told me.

324
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,592
Teach testified to that, man.

325
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,222
He- that's why I didn't even catch the rap for...for manslaughter.

326
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,628
I got accessory and arson.

327
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,293
I've done eight out of 10-15.

328
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,601
I mean, what...what more do you want from me?

329
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,546
Okay, so,

330
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,648
let's make today

331
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,284
an extra special day.

332
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,785
Let's do one nice thing for someone else,

333
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,050
but not tell anyone else that we did it, okay?

334
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:23,996
Okay.

335
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,987
Win with the seven-deuce, it's 10 bucks for everybody.

336
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,894
Win both ways with the seven-deuce,

337
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,897
- 20 bucks a head. - Jack's wild?

338
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,467
Jack's definitely not wild.

339
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,504
Marsha, stay in?

340
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,072
Hello?

341
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,019
Hi, is this Jack Mabry's place?

342
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,520
Excuse me?

343
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,211
Oh, my name is Lucetta Creeson.

344
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:42,806
My husband's...

345
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,811
Excuse me, I couldn't understand what-

346
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,189
Can I speak to Jack Mabry?

347
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,577
Well, this is Mrs. Mabry.

348
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,312
Okay, can I speak to Jack?

349
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,821
You need my husband. I can give him a mess-

350
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,200
- Hey, you get ahold of him? - She was a little short.

351
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,839
You know? Like, I don't know.

352
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,973
Like she didn't want to talk or something.

353
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,343
Why-why-why you talkin' to her?

354
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,382
Hey, Tommy, Tommy, we don't bite.

355
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,316
Huh-uh, no biting, okay?

356
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,123
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

357
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:28,014
I need you to do this for me right now.

358
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,182
Right now. Don't let it slide.

359
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,488
Okay, I will.

360
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,495
Okay? Call him tonight.

361
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,032
Call him tomorrow. Call him tomorrow night.

362
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,693
Call him the day after. Call him the day after tomorrow night.

363
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,902
That's what I'm getting

364
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,898
at is do you believe what you did was wrong?

365
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,669
What-what d'you think, because I grew up westside

366
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,813
that like I'm one of these socio-delinquent types,

367
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,813
don't know the difference between right and wrong?

368
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,418
You want me to tell you about my bad childhood and shit?

369
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,917
I don't know. Did you have one?

370
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,414
Well, you know, at the time,

371
00:22:58,415 --> 00:22:59,886
I thought a lot of shit was normal.

372
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,049
It was definitely unhealthy,

373
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,559
but on the same token, you know, I didn't think

374
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,994
I was a bad person to begin with.

375
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,191
So, you know, I mean, what, you want to know

376
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,530
if I'm gonna light any more grandparents on fire?

377
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,365
- Are you? - No.

378
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,957
You got any more?

379
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,531
Yeah, I got one.

380
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,270
Yeah well, try to make a better effort with that one.

381
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,784
I'm not trying to be flip.

382
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,752
I think I deserve to be free, I do.

383
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,791
Why, because you did the time?

384
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,775
That's it, you're ready?

385
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:39,759
Now you're a clean slate?

386
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,083
I'm clean as anybody, man.

387
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:43,093
I'm clean as you.

388
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,895
Well, maybe, maybe not.

389
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,766
Seriously, let me ask you something, you know.

390
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,306
Why are you- why are you- why are you gonna sit there,

391
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,773
like, asking me these questions like you never done nothin'?

392
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,040
I mean, you know, why do you get to walk around free and I don't?

393
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,944
I wasn't convicted of a crime.

394
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,982
Oh, come on, you never did anything bad?

395
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,929
Never did anybody no wrong,

396
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,122
had to be forgiven for nothin'?

397
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,654
No, never broke the law.

398
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,792
What, you never got a speeding ticket?

399
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,622
You never backed somebody up in a bar fight or something?

400
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,924
Shit, Vietnam you never killed some kid- you carry that with you?

401
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,464
You step out on your wife,

402
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,624
you fuck that little 15-year-old who looked at you sideways?

403
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,491
Okay okay.

404
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,737
No, come on, man! Come on!

405
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,428
How long you get to keep

406
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,348
judgin' a person for

407
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:25,308
one had thing they done?

408
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,972
No matter how much I paid,

409
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,104
I gotta keep eatin' shit with you?

410
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,905
For how long?

411
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,580
That ain't right. It ain't.

412
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,947
I mean, I'm beggin' you, man. I'm beggin' you.

413
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,818
I'm a person. I'm a person. Look at my record, you know.

414
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,823
Look at- look at what I've done in here.

415
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,690
I mean, I'm different than when I come in here, man.

416
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:50,630
I've grown a lot. I'm like fuckin' reborn, man.

417
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,599
What does that mean to you, being reborn?

418
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,264
What?

419
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,304
What does that mean to you?

420
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,533
Hi. Yeah, I'm back.

421
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,808
Hey, Mrs. Creeson.

422
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:29,896
Hey, Jake.

423
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,883
Thanks. Bye, guys.

424
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,061
Creeson!

425
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,969
Oh, the rows look so nice.

426
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,570
I like 'em thick, baby.

427
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,006
- Yeah? - It looks really good.

428
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,737
- I've been using that mousse you sent. - Yeah?

429
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,075
'Cause Crystal said you put the rag on before you go to sleep,

430
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,540
and when you wake up they're

431
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,775
still all clean and nice- they look really good.

432
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,081
They look tight. You look so fucking good.

433
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,224
I miss you so much.

434
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,966
What have you got to tell me? I mean...

435
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,566
Well, I called him

436
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,801
and he didn't call me back, so I left another message.

437
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,379
Okay, that's good, but you

438
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,880
know you got to get with him person to person.

439
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,118
I'm on it. Baby, I'm on it.

440
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,574
One on one, you know what I'm saying?

441
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,948
I gotta have you with me on it. I can't do this by myself.

442
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,090
Anything.

443
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,454
I would do anything for you, you know that, right?

444
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,992
Yeah.

445
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,257
Okay okay.

446
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,491
Baby, I wore something special for you.

447
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,259
Did you? What did you wear?

448
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,961
- Nothing. - Oh God.

449
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,497
You're killin' me.

450
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,150
Oh no. Okay okay okay.

451
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,807
- What? - This is too much. No no.

452
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,319
Come on. No no, I'm sorry. Just come on. Come here, come here.

453
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,288
Honey?

454
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,949
I can't get no ticket.

455
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,117
I can't get a ticket, you understand, right?

456
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:33,786
I'm too close.

457
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,831
- Baby. Baby. - Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,936
Okay, I'm so close.

459
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,936
- What am I gonna do? - It's gonna happen.

460
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,166
- I can't do much more of this. - Don't worry.

461
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,037
I can't. I ain't gonna make it.

462
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,201
I'm serious, Lucetta.

463
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,872
I just think I want- like I want to kill myself.

464
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,178
You don't even joke like that, okay?

465
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,786
Don't joke.

466
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,219
I love you.

467
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,991
You want something to eat? I got some cream puffs

468
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,360
and some animal crackers and some milk and stuff.

469
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,901
"That the Father may be glorified... "

470
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,519
"... the embrace of sin, the individual

471
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,020
achieves perfect metaphysical pitch

472
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,852
and transforms himself

473
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,120
into a tuning fork of God. "

474
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm trying improve myself here, you motherfuckers!

475
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,884
This is Jack and Madylyn Mabry.

476
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,612
Please leave a message.

477
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,724
Hi. Hey, this is Lucetta Creeson.

478
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,827
Um, I called before.

479
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:44,827
I'm Stoney Creeson's wife.

480
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,929
I spoke to Mrs. Mabry,

481
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,224
but Mr. Mabry, this is for you.

482
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,891
I would like to talk to you about my husband.

483
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,900
Um, it's kind of important to us.

484
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,630
And I work most mornings, but-

485
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,741
well, no, look, I could rearrange things,

486
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,571
so whenever's good for you is fine with me.

487
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,148
Shit.

488
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,614
I wasn't done.

489
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,151
Who goes to sleep at 9:00?

490
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,285
Mr. Mabry?

491
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,693
- Officer Mabry? - Sorry?

492
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,528
Mrs. Creeson...

493
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:01,201
I'm Stoney's wife.

494
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,362
Oh oh, Mrs. Creeson.

495
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,337
Look, call me Lucetta though, please.

496
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,743
You're here to see your husband?

497
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,710
No, silly, I'm here to see you.

498
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,851
Wait, I'm sorry, didn't you get my message?

499
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,147
Oh yeah, okay. Well,

500
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:18,886
there's a way to meet with family, Mrs. Creeson.

501
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,490
You have to go through the office for me to see you.

502
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,217
- Oh right. - The case officer to...

503
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,091
meet and assess the home situation.

504
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,732
- That's-that's how we. - See, that's the thing though, sir,

505
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,233
because, I mean, I am the home situation.

506
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,810
Mrs. Creeson,

507
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,062
- just call the office... - Lucetta.

508
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,802
Lucetta. Just call the office

509
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:40,574
and make an appointment.

510
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,964
That's the way you have to do it.

511
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,338
Can't I just talk to you for a while?

512
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,453
I mean, can't we just,

513
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,574
sort of just you and me make a date or something?

514
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,046
- No, we can't. - Please, please.

515
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,514
You know how much this means to us.

516
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,302
If you're coming to see your husband,

517
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:53,019
fine, but we can't do it any other way.

518
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,385
And I'm late, really.

519
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,584
Well, Mr. Mabry,

520
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,922
Mr. Mabry, I wanted to give you a little something

521
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,169
my kids made in class.

522
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,087
Yeah, I can't accept that.

523
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,842
It's inappropriate. Thank you anyway.

524
00:32:03,843 --> 00:32:05,064
But it's for the birds, see?

525
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,204
And they- it's a nest and they come and they take their twine

526
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,432
and their twigs and stuff and they make their little home.

527
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,041
Thank you.

528
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,371
Okay.

529
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,071
- Nice to meet you. - Thank you.

530
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,822
Okay.

531
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,389
What the hell is this?

532
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,623
- What's that? - This...your wife.

533
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,993
What, she sent it to you?

534
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,294
She gave it to me in the parking lot just now.

535
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,495
Wait, what, Lucetta come and find you?

536
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,664
She gave that to me in the parking lot. Don't mess with me.

537
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,106
I ain't lookin' for any kind of trouble with you, you know.

538
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,142
I hope you didn't put her up to it.

539
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,440
The parole board's gonna send you a flop in the mail

540
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,139
and you won't even see them.

541
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,442
Lucetta does whatever the fuck she wants.

542
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:55,945
I told you, man.

543
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,678
She's just boisterous.

544
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,851
Jesus, what a week.

545
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,700
Hey hey, I want to see what you think about something.

546
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,179
You ever- you seen this?

547
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,208
I found it in the library.

548
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,220
"Zukangor, The Sound and Life God."

549
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,880
Yeah, you know it?

550
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,357
No.

551
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,860
They say the sound part come first.

552
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,555
They say the- when you experience

553
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,065
a spiritual truth

554
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,204
that it comes to you as a sound,

555
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,636
that it goes through you,

556
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,969
changes your vibration, gets you back into harmony.

557
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,510
Like God's tuning fork or something.

558
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,148
And then if you let that happen to you,

559
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,841
then- then you get the light,

560
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,419
or you get illumination or something.

561
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,414
I wouldn't know about that. I'm an Episcopalian.

562
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,527
They say it starts with small things,

563
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,528
like little sounds, little vibrations,

564
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,563
like a-just like a buzzing electric light

565
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,167
or rushing water or the sound of a bee or...

566
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,201
- Yeah? - Yeah.

567
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,895
And then it grows.

568
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,201
But there's no priest or nothing. It's not like a religion.

569
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,492
There's just this one dude named Arnold

570
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:30,744
who's the Zukmaster.

571
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,406
They say you do this practice all by yourself.

572
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,849
You can- you can hear better.

573
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,750
You can hear God speaking to you through sounds.

574
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,413
What's the practice?

575
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,787
- They chant "Hue. " - Hue?

576
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,089
- And then they listen. - For what, a bee?

577
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,423
Maybe, I don't know.

578
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,195
But you know, the thing is

579
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,104
they say you got to keep coming back

580
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,041
until you pay for all your shit.

581
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,545
That you've got to fix it

582
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,947
over a lot of lives, you know, until you work it all out.

583
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,644
Well, what about this life?

584
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,154
What about answering for

585
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,451
the things that you've done in this life?

586
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,957
Shit, I know I have.

587
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,962
Have you?

588
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,623
Yeah. Have you?

589
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,408
This is the body of Christ, given for you.

590
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,478
The body of Christ, given for you.

591
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,645
The body of Christ, given for you.

592
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,808
- I'll be right back. - Sure.

593
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,691
Here, you drive home.

594
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,489
I'm going to talk to the pastor a minute and then I'll walk.

595
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,325
Okay.

596
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,333
Hey yo, foul, bitch!

597
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,130
Damn, that's a hard foul!

598
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,330
Yo, that's a foul!

599
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,780
Hue...

600
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,831
Man, you should've dunked it!

601
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,839
Okay, I've never done this before, so-

602
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,845
well, I mean, I come to the...

603
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,313
Church every week and I really try.

604
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,479
And I don't know, I mean, I guess I had hoped with time

605
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,682
it would be easier and easier and...

606
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,919
And I'd be...

607
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,689
My family, people close to me,

608
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,029
it seems to come to them easily, but for me it's...

609
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,729
I mean I've...

610
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,396
I don't know.

611
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,073
I mean I've...

612
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,081
Sometimes the thoughts that I have,

613
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,082
feelings...

614
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,247
But, uh, sometimes

615
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,359
I just think maybe you should shoot me or something.

616
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,428
Well, I don't believe that that's what God wants for you.

617
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,361
Well, what does he want?

618
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,799
I wish I had a simple answer for you.

619
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,701
I'm not sure what God wants for you.

620
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,303
Is there anything...

621
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,540
There's an old Biblical passage that says...

622
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,614
"Be still and know that I am God. "

623
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,585
Which is a way of saying

624
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,156
sometimes God does, um,

625
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,556
speak to us in mysterious ways.

626
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,970
Off the rail!

627
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,979
I said off the rail!

628
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,539
Hello?

629
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,974
Hi, this is Lucetta Creeson. We talked last week.

630
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,444
I'm sorry, what is your name again?

631
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,514
Lucetta Creeson.

632
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,050
I was just wondering if Jack was home.

633
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,779
I'm afraid he's still- oh no, wait, hold on.

634
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:09,221
- Jack, telephone.  - Who is it? Who? Who is it?

635
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,121
A friend of yours?

636
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,293
- Hello.  - Hey.

637
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,125
It's Lucetta Creeson.

638
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,494
Listen, I was just wondering, um,

639
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,693
when we could meet, when we could get together.

640
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,898
Uh, Mrs. Creeson, I don't know how you're calling my house,

641
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,633
but I told you to call the office.

642
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,368
Well, look, I'm just,

643
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,037
I'm not that great at offices and, you know,

644
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,514
I just- I just can't be real, like, in an office, you know?

645
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,550
- Look, Mrs. Creeson  - Lucetta.

646
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,054
Mrs. Creeson, I have business with your husband.

647
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,385
Well, that's why I'm calling.

648
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,550
I mean, what, did you think I had another reason?

649
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,321
Well, no, I didn't.

650
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,073
Maybe we could go to lunch,

651
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:50,398
you could bring Mrs. Mabry too.

652
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,263
You know, she's got a sweet voice. What's her first name?

653
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,062
Look, I admire that you love your husband

654
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,603
and you want to do what's right for him,

655
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,765
but you're not helping him. I'm telling you that right now.

656
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,774
Listen to me, Jack.

657
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,004
I do love my husband.

658
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,943
I love my husband

659
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,381
so much.

660
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,189
And all I'm asking you is for a chance

661
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,121
to help you see him in a different light.

662
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,928
I mean, how many men at that place you work at

663
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,464
have somebody loving them like that, huh?

664
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,197
Doesn't that mean something to you,

665
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,930
a man in a position like yours?

666
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,133
It-it- no, it-it does, it does. Don't misunderstand me.

667
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,870
I just want him home.

668
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,482
I want... I want him so bad.

669
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,948
I want his arms around me.

670
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,451
I want him in my bed.

671
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,954
I miss him.

672
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,285
Can't I persuade you?

673
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,621
Who's it gonna hurt, hmm?

674
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,061
Just let me come see you, please.

675
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,993
Let me come see you, Jack.

676
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,904
I got him.

677
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,978
It's gonna happen, baby.

678
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,309
Huh. Honey, you okay?

679
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,183
I'm so fuckin' tired.

680
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,759
Can't you sleep?

681
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,794
No, it's too loud all the time.

682
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,022
So noisy I can't...

683
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,759
I can't get out of my head.

684
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,165
I can't hear nothin'. I can't listen.

685
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,000
This place is startin' to mess with my head.

686
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,541
I'm tellin' you, I'm having these weird~ass dreams.

687
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,679
Poor honey.

688
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,885
I thought I wanted to kill myself, right?

689
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,222
Thought I wanted to hang myself in the solitary.

690
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,949
I don't get it. You dreamed that?

691
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,185
But then I got too scared to die

692
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,956
and I just hung there for all of eternity.

693
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,861
I don't want to fuckin' be here.

694
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,702
I don't want to fuckin' be here.

695
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,904
Honey.

696
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,052
Honey, what'd you have to eat that night?

697
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,053
It must've been something. Was it spicy?

698
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,407
- Shoot it!  - All right, let's go.

699
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,207
That's the grandson I've been tellin' you about right there.

700
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,683
- How cute.  - His eyes are so...

701
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,787
I got a grandchild.

702
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,587
Do you really?

703
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,231
Yeah. Her name's Katie, three years old.

704
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,958
- Cute.  - Oh, yeah. Yeah, very cute.

705
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,796
Does she look like you?

706
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,097
Hell no. No no no.

707
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,262
I bet she loves you though.

708
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,739
- Yeah well...  - You see her much?

709
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,278
They live upstate, so we don't see her that much.

710
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,110
Aw, that's too bad.

711
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:34,749
She's getting a divorce, my daughter.

712
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,552
- I'm sorry.  - What are you gonna do?

713
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,752
People are gonna do what they're gonna do.

714
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,466
Are you in pain?

715
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,999
Yeah, it's just my back.

716
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,568
Oh. What'd you get that,

717
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,432
playing ball or like from some war?

718
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,096
No no, it's just life.

719
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,799
So I don't know if I can-

720
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,842
I don't want you to get your hopes up.

721
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,479
About what?

722
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,581
What I can do for you, for your husband.

723
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,274
- There's a whole system  - Have you tried magnet therapy?

724
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,426
For your back, I mean.

725
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:05,580
It's like these magnets that you wear and stuff.

726
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,984
- Magnets?  - Yeah, it's really good.

727
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,989
Actually, you should come over sometime,

728
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,027
because I got these insoles this guy sold me

729
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,788
and I wear 'em in my shoes

730
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,193
and I don't get tired in school or anything.

731
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,699
And- yeah, and sometimes

732
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,497
I even put 'em under my pillow before I go to sleep.

733
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,196
And what does that do?

734
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,169
Well, okay,

735
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,675
you know how we're all toxic and stuff, right,

736
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,304
with like all the microwaves and cell phones

737
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,179
and all that weird stuff flying through the air.

738
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,820
So it all builds up inside of you, right,

739
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,887
and it makes you all achy and upset-

740
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,718
and it can give you brain tumors, really-

741
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,382
I mean, it kills people.

742
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,120
So these magnets, they detox you.

743
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,891
- Wow, that's...  - Yeah, it's real. I believe it.

744
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,024
You don't believe it?

745
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,068
I don't know, I guess.

746
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,035
No, it's real.

747
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,869
I mean, look, I'm all into the body, you know,

748
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,477
and for me if the body's feeling good,

749
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,307
the mind just follows, you know?

750
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,005
Absolutely.

751
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,980
Egg?

752
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,211
My kids made 'em.

753
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,377
Now I got 'em all and I have to eat 'em.

754
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,319
They're nice. They're pretty.

755
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,015
Eat me please.

756
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,727
Why not?

757
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,106
I'm just eating the healthy part.

758
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:37,678
Go on, just eat the whole thing.

759
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,239
Creeson, what's up?

760
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,381
You haven't been to chow in two days.

761
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,718
You got a call out to go to Medical. Get dressed.

762
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,259
Hold up there.

763
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,753
You feel anything?

764
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,931
No.

765
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:36,633
Like a tingling?

766
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:41,509
No, I don't. I don't think I...

767
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,805
Like a pull?

768
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,504
It's not dramatic, you know.

769
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,015
It's just- it's kind of a sense.

770
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,952
Yeah well, you know, maybe a little something.

771
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,851
Yeah.

772
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,056
"To what extent is my commitment to obey God

773
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,859
based on dos and don'ts

774
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,027
or on a true love for Him?"

775
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,806
"In what recent circumstance was I aware of God's leading?"

776
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,244
Why don't you say the blessing?

777
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,311
Yeah.

778
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,045
Blessed O Lord...

779
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,150
blessed O Lord,

780
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:55,855
this food to our use, and us to Thy loving service,

781
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,935
and... make us mindful of the needs of others...

782
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,066
- In Christ's name, Amen.  - Amen.

783
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,778
You lose your place?

784
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,280
You want an egg?

785
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,998
Sin comes naturally to us from our birth.

786
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,940
We-we- it's inbred in us.

787
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:20,139
We are not sinners because we sin;

788
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,808
we sin because we are sinners.

789
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,150
Even if you lived a life of perfect righteousness,

790
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,121
you deserve hell. You know why?

791
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,625
Because "All of our righteousnesses," Isaiah says,

792
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,320
"Are as filthy rags. "

793
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,646
You're real sweet, Jack.

794
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,749
You're real sweet.

795
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,422
Fuck me harder.

796
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,299
You're good, Jack.

797
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,129
You're a good man for helping us,

798
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,432
I appreciate it.

799
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,106
You know that nobody can know about this.

800
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,946
You know that, right?

801
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,610
I mean nobody.

802
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,779
That's very important.

803
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:46,087
Whatever you want, it'll all go bad if anybody knows.

804
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,288
Bad for everybody, you understand that?

805
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,296
Of course, silly.

806
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,509
What's wrong? You're not eating?

807
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,342
You ever think about things they say go on forever?

808
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,181
What?

809
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,017
Things they say go on forever- like...

810
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,953
What's that mean, you know?

811
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:58,192
The sky, like, they say the sky goes on forever.

812
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,833
But what is that really? That's-

813
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:05,530
I mean, you can't see nothing you can't see, so...

814
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,374
It's like a big bowl of blue above you.

815
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,308
You can see clouds during the day

816
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,414
or you can see stars at night maybe,

817
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,073
but even with a telescope you can't see forever.

818
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,981
So how do they know?

819
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,347
Know what?

820
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,514
What it is.

821
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,025
Eternity- how do they know?

822
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,732
So- so, Jack,

823
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,707
he said the board's gonna review the whole thing, okay?

824
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,243
And they're going to take into consideration

825
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,610
your age and, you know,

826
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,684
your mom and all that,

827
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:54,584
and the fact that you were an addict back then, um...

828
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,954
- Hey, Stoney baby?  - Hmm?

829
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,255
Look at me.

830
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,301
Well, I was trying to tell you about your parole.

831
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,403
Yeah?

832
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,267
Well, you weren't listening.

833
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,970
Oh yeah, I'm listening.

834
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,707
I am.

835
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:25,115
Okay, so Jack said, um-

836
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,084
You call him Jack?

837
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:28,780
Sure.

838
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,623
That's good. What's he say?

839
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,962
Okay, so, um, he's gonna talk to you

840
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,658
and he's going over the whole thing

841
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,115
and he's gonna decide in a

842
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,499
few days to write up his notes in your case file

843
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,704
to submit it to the parole

844
00:57:45,705 --> 00:57:47,471
commission so when they go over it next week

845
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,628
they're gonna see it.

846
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:49,736
Isn't that great, baby?

847
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,972
Honey, this could be it. Isn't that great?

848
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,517
Yeah.

849
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,159
Didn't-didn't-didn't I do good?

850
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,794
Well, look at me.

851
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,504
What are you doing?

852
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,768
Sometimes I think the best thing is...

853
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,872
Is just-just listen.

854
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,956
Would you stop playin'?

855
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,622
Is the kingdom of heaven you think it should be a peaceful kingdom

856
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,029
And we should all get along?

857
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,525
That's great, but is it just going

858
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,846
to be a constant struggle...

859
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:47,124
...to have the kingdom of heaven here on earth, one of his creation?

860
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:44,962
That's a tough one.

861
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,875
Crack 53!

862
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,817
Just tell me, is it the 30th or the 31st?

863
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,387
I've had about enough lip from you!

864
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,921
God damn it, just tell me, which one is it?

865
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,559
You can button that up right now and be nice. And I mean it.

866
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,502
Creeson's here.

867
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,070
How do ask a person to...

868
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,730
To explain something that-

869
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,104
that they experienced

870
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:30,939
to where another person's got no way

871
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,674
to relate to the whole indefiniteness of it, you know?

872
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,281
You don't believe me already, do you?

873
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,547
I'm not saying I don't believe you. I just, you know, I-

874
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,417
look, I've seen the tape, it's quite a thing.

875
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,092
But nothing happened to you.

876
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:46,254
I mean, you weren't involved in any way.

877
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,920
Yeah, look, I don't know how to even-

878
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:54,229
I'm not-

879
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,428
I don't know. I-

880
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,630
You had, what, a profound

881
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,969
spiritual epiphany.

882
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,703
Shit, man, I ain't never even heard that word before.

883
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,371
Look, we don't have to talk about it.

884
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,642
You know, it really don't matter.

885
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,786
Well...

886
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,221
I mean, don't get me wrong,

887
01:00:13,222 --> 01:00:15,116
I'd like to believe in such things, but-

888
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,053
Like what? Like me? You believe in me?

889
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:18,788
Sure, I'd like to believe in you too.

890
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,491
I mean that's why we're all here, right?

891
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,296
Wow.

892
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:32,164
Okay, you know, wait, look,

893
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,275
there were something like...

894
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,070
It was just a moment.

895
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:42,815
The static, it just all went away, you know?

896
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,316
And I could really hear,

897
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,977
like I could hear clear, for real.

898
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:51,024
I don't know. It just made me see everything different.

899
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,492
It made me look at my life in a different way.

900
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,154
It was just all of a sudden I could- I could see that

901
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,816
my life in here isn't empty

902
01:00:58,817 --> 01:01:01,200
and pointless like I thought it was before.

903
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,461
Family and...

904
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,540
- Look, Stone, just drop it. - Drop what?

905
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,305
Well, I know what you're trying to do, but don't.

906
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,508
Just-just-just don't. It's not helping. Just stop.

907
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,846
Hey look, man,

908
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,512
it don't matter to me no more.

909
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,124
- What doesn't matter?  - I don't care about what-

910
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:27,387
what you're doin' or what anybody else is tryin' to make you do.

911
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,633
Make me do? What's that?

912
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:31,021
Nobody's trying to make me do anything.

913
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,533
Okay.

914
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:40,074
You should do what you think is right, okay?

915
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,177
I am whatever you say I am in there, so write what you feel.

916
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,644
Seriously. I mean it. I mean, judge me how you think.

917
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,840
- Well... - I mean, don't get me wrong,

918
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,882
I want to be out,

919
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,885
but I'm gonna wrestle with the same shit if I'm out.

920
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,718
And I'm gonna keep this feeling if I'm in.

921
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,821
So you're all good now?

922
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,933
No, no, no. Look, I ain't sayin' I'm all happy all of a sudden.

923
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,433
You know, my middle finger's been up a long time, man.

924
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:11,573
I'm not just gonna start wavin' and smilin' at people.

925
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,732
I'm gonna pop off. I'm gonna lose my temper, and-

926
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,072
and say shit and do shit that I'm gonna regret, whatever.

927
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:21,079
I just- I just- I am who I am, you know?

928
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,412
And that's okay. You know what I'm sayin'?

929
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,952
No. No, I'm afraid I don't.

930
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,784
Well, I told you I couldn't explain it really.

931
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,051
- Are you okay? - Yeah. My back.

932
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,957
I'm gonna go sleep in the other room.

933
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,598
You can take great comfort in that,

934
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,529
but that can be a false comfort.

935
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,602
Sometimes in the twilight of a civilization,

936
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,035
there can be a great cultural flowering,

937
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:48,699
but in reality, there are cracks in the foundation of that society

938
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,310
and that society is doomed.

939
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,333
If you really want to know,

940
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:17,961
I think it's some kind of play-acting or something.

941
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,766
It's all bullshit?

942
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:24,139
No. No. Look, Stoney's just...

943
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,110
You know. I mean, he's screwed up.

944
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,647
He's got weird ideas about things.

945
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,479
Sometimes really weird.

946
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,622
But, I mean, he's always been that way.

947
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:38,487
Talkin' to him,

948
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,525
he almost seemed like...

949
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,664
Like what?

950
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,266
Something- really, I don't know. Different.

951
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:49,370
No.

952
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:53,497
Look, he-'s just trying to impress you, you know,

953
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,166
trying to do whatever it takes to get out.

954
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,335
Can you blame him?

955
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,777
- No, it's okay. - What?

956
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,715
Hey, sit down.

957
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,547
Come on. Come on, sit down.

958
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,383
Sit down.

959
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,819
Look, he admires you a lot, you know.

960
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,727
He told me he learned a lot talking to you.

961
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,963
Can you be straight?

962
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:27,039
Straight as you.

963
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,867
Is this all just a- I mean,

964
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,707
just-just-just tell me what's going on.

965
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,879
I don't do anything I don't want to do.

966
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,214
I like you.

967
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,519
I like you, Jack.

968
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,326
I would never fuck you if I didn't want to.

969
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,058
Well, thanks.

970
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,670
God, you're beautiful, you know.

971
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,503
You're beautiful.

972
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,510
Thank you.

973
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,750
I'm not gonna come over here anymore.

974
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,547
- You're not? - No.

975
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:15,849
Okay.

976
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,457
Maybe I should just take

977
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,288
some antidepressants or something, I don't know.

978
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,932
- Yes, you will. - What?

979
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,726
It's okay though.

980
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,927
I don't mind when they say, "Oh no, no more,"

981
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,595
'cause then I just sit back and wait.

982
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,639
But you'll call,

983
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,404
won't you, or drop by?

984
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,640
Like maybe late again some night, won't you?

985
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,944
Oh God.

986
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,478
Look, I don't care if you deny it. It's funny to me.

987
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,488
St-stop this now.

988
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,295
I think about you so much,

989
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:54,959
Jack. All day long I'm thinking about you.

990
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,961
I think about you at work.

991
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,225
Don't say that.

992
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,596
You're sexy, Jack,

993
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,396
and you know if you let Stone out,

994
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,131
we can still be friends too. He won't know.

995
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,003
He won't even care.

996
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,974
Look, I do what I do because I'm on my own, okay?

997
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,637
And I got to make my own way, so don't you want to help us?

998
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,477
- Don't you want to help me? - Don't talk like that.

999
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,142
I can't. It's not that simple.

1000
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,826
You can't leave, can you?

1001
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,157
It's sweet.

1002
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,163
What the hell am I doing? God damn it.

1003
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,208
Oh, come on, Jack. He's a good man at heart.

1004
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,675
You really believe that?

1005
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,939
Yeah, I do.

1006
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,344
No different than you and me.

1007
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,109
Do you go to church?

1008
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:55,722
Hell no. There's no such thing as God.

1009
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,675
They called again. They need the Creeson report.

1010
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,208
I just sent it!

1011
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,937
You don't have to yell. I'm on the intercom.

1012
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,606
You got your RGC recommendation.

1013
01:07:56,773 --> 01:08:00,307
Vocational counseling, psych therapy,

1014
01:08:00,308 --> 01:08:02,583
GED, NA, NA program.

1015
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,521
So the board needs to decide

1016
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:08,219
if it's safe to let you back into the world,

1017
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,455
that you're not a danger to yourself or others.

1018
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,725
Rehabilitated, right?

1019
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,391
Yeah.

1020
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,093
You know, in my book it says

1021
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:20,230
that chronic neck pain comes from bein' hanged in another life.

1022
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:23,275
Well, it's my back. It's not my neck.

1023
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,777
Well, I'm just makin' conversation.

1024
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:30,267
Look, if you're not interested in the details of your hearing,

1025
01:08:30,268 --> 01:08:30,975
we're done here.

1026
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,813
- Done? - We're done.

1027
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:34,412
How do you mean we're done?

1028
01:08:34,413 --> 01:08:36,219
My report's already sent. We're done.

1029
01:08:38,381 --> 01:08:39,828
Basically they want to hear

1030
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:42,295
that you take responsibility for your actions.

1031
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,638
See, the thing about that, I don't know.

1032
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,144
About what?

1033
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,625
It's funny, you know,

1034
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:04,649
'cause you're always askin' me about that night-

1035
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,684
how it made me feel.

1036
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,650
You know, when my cousin come out of the house

1037
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,354
and got me and we went back inside...

1038
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:22,166
It was trippy, man, because like two minutes before,

1039
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:27,101
you know, my poppy, he was- he was alive. There was color in his face.

1040
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,140
There was light in his eyes.

1041
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,802
And then I go inside there and...

1042
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,610
And then I see them

1043
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:43,986
lyin' there all over everywhere.

1044
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:51,528
There was this buzzing in my ears, you know,

1045
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,066
and I thought it was just the shit that we was on,

1046
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,703
but it kept growin'

1047
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,465
and it started scarin' the shit out of me.

1048
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,540
Teach was bouncin' off the walls,

1049
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,076
yellin' at me, "We got to do something,

1050
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,338
you gotta help me. We gotta handle this. "

1051
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,574
But all I could hear in my head was this sound.

1052
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:15,584
And then, I don't know how I knew,

1053
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:19,557
but I just knew that there needed to be a fire.

1054
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,696
I went to the garage.

1055
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,888
I got the can of gasoline

1056
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,726
and I got the match

1057
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,868
and I lit it.

1058
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,375
You ever seen a fire take control?

1059
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:37,534
It's somethin', man. It's alive.

1060
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,839
And I watched it

1061
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,778
take them up

1062
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,681
and start to change them.

1063
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,222
And the only thought that came in my head

1064
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:54,761
was "This is awesome. "

1065
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,794
Awesome?

1066
01:10:56,953 --> 01:11:04,594
Yeah. It was truly awesome.

1067
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,738
Um, the thing is that

1068
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,939
I know I'm supposed to take responsibility for my action,

1069
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,950
I know that I'm supposed to feel guilty about it,

1070
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:22,555
but I never did.

1071
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,623
And I never knew why.

1072
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:31,765
But now I think I can understand that it was just

1073
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:37,265
part of what was supposed to happen in my life's journey,

1074
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,962
you know?

1075
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,301
That was your decision- you did that.

1076
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,841
No, I'm not sayin' I didn't.

1077
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,946
I'm saying that we're all God's co-workers,

1078
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:47,945
and we don't even know it.

1079
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,947
Your crime has nothin' to do with God.

1080
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,177
Why not? God is everything.

1081
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,981
You know, look at earthquakes and floods,

1082
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,250
and- and tornadoes, and all the bad shit that happens-

1083
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,156
why don't you think that we're a part of all of that too?

1084
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,397
What we do, you know,

1085
01:12:02,398 --> 01:12:06,164
the shit that we carry with us from one life to the next,

1086
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,428
maybe there's a plan that includes all of us-

1087
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:11,663
you and me and my grandparents,

1088
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,308
and we just don't know it. How can we know?

1089
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:18,609
Enough of this shit. You know-you know- you and Lucetta,

1090
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:20,714
- she said that you were- - Lucetta?

1091
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,508
- Your wife - What, you call her Lucetta?

1092
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,515
- She said- - Don't.

1093
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,711
- What? - Don't listen to her.

1094
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:28,116
What do you mean?

1095
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,383
Don't listen to what she's tellin' you, man.

1096
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,890
Well, she believes in you.

1097
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,292
Look, it's a game to her, man.

1098
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,830
It's a game. She-

1099
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:40,865
I told you in the beginning, she's an alien.

1100
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,627
She's a- she's like a freak.

1101
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,203
That's not a nice thing to say.

1102
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,670
No, listen, I'm tellin' it to you straight, okay,

1103
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,365
she's just workin' on you.

1104
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,034
She's workin' on you. She's fuckin' you over, man.

1105
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,543
She's an animal.

1106
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,808
You know, you're fuckin' nuts, you know that?

1107
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:57,349
You're fuckin' nuts.

1108
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,315
You got a beautiful wife who cares about you, and-

1109
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,547
Beautiful? You think she's beautiful?

1110
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,262
Okay, you're a con. I've known that from the fuckin' start.

1111
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:12,524
I don't believe you for one fuckin' second. Never did, never did.

1112
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,066
So you've both been conning me? Okay, I know.

1113
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,728
I've been around the block a few times. I ought to know better.

1114
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,399
- I'm sick and fuckin' tired of it. - What'd I say, man?

1115
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,012
You expect me to eat this new shit you've been handing out?

1116
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,239
Write a nice little note about your goddamn fucking epiphany?

1117
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,781
You're the same bastard you've always been.

1118
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,418
I know I am.

1119
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,425
That's what I've been sayin', man.

1120
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:35,763
You don't- you don't get it.

1121
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:37,087
Get it? Oh no no, I got it.

1122
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,248
I got it and I'm goddamn fuckin' fed up with you.

1123
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,258
The both of you can go to hell for all I care.

1124
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,921
I can't f- what have I done? Jesus Christ, I've been-

1125
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,432
I mean, just goddamn year in and year out

1126
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,525
sitting across the desk

1127
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:51,435
from this and we pretend we're doing something,

1128
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,267
you pretend you've heard us and then we fall for it.

1129
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,965
And then you come back in one year

1130
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:58,305
and you're sitting right back here across the same desk from us again

1131
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,104
and somebody out there is hurt or dead.

1132
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:01,448
Well, I'm not buyin' it anymore.

1133
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:02,640
Nothin' changed for the better.

1134
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:04,278
It's all bullshit. No one changes for the better.

1135
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,328
I've spent my whole fuckin'

1136
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:06,613
adult life doin' this goddamn bullshit.

1137
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,949
I'm sick to death of this whole fuckin' waste.

1138
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,818
You get no more of my time, pal.

1139
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,153
Get the hell out of here. Come on.

1140
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:15,455
Let's go, come on, get out.

1141
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,791
Okay.

1142
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,264
Oh God. Oh God.

1143
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:22,334
Hey, man, you have anyone?

1144
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:25,233
- What? - Anybody to stand behind you.

1145
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,171
Are you all alone?

1146
01:14:26,172 --> 01:14:26,737
I'm not-

1147
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:28,303
Blow your motherfuckin' life up, man.

1148
01:14:28,304 --> 01:14:29,843
Blow it up all the way. Do it.

1149
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,740
Really, take it all the way. It helps.

1150
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:33,642
Hey, Peterson, we're done.

1151
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,646
Just go ahead and burn your motherfuckin' life.

1152
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,445
- Now, God damn it! - Blow it up. Let it go, all of it.

1153
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,984
Did anybody not fucking hear me?

1154
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,485
- Let's go, please! - Go all the way.

1155
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,817
- He's coming! - Just embrace it, man. Burn it up.

1156
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,048
- Get him the hell out of here.

1157
01:14:45,049 --> 01:14:46,290
- It's awesome. I'm pullin' for you.

1158
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,924
- No, really, I'm pullin' for you.

1159
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:49,487
- Fuck you, you sick son of a bitch.

1160
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,714
This is Jack and Madylyn Mabry. Please leave a message,

1161
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,349
Hey, Jack- Mr. Mabry,

1162
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,688
I left messages at work, but you didn't call me back.

1163
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,990
I'm kind of in the dark here.

1164
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:29,135
Don't leave me dangling. I hate that.

1165
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:38,801
Let the machine get it.

1166
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,990
Hello?

1167
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,756
Is Mom there?

1168
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:59,263
It's Candace.

1169
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,238
Hey, it's Mom. Mm-hmm.

1170
01:16:09,432 --> 01:16:11,605
Yeah, I understand.

1171
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,838
What's up?

1172
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:15,846
Well, how's Katie?

1173
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,092
Did you know you started out as a stone?

1174
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,097
Hmm?

1175
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:38,436
Your soul- it started out as a mineral or a pebble,

1176
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,541
and then it was reincarnated as a plant,

1177
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:45,440
then as a fish, birds, animals and so on.

1178
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,638
You had to work your way up to being a human.

1179
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,613
Know what it's been doing, your soul?

1180
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:53,583
- Hmm, what? - It's been paying off debts-

1181
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,279
past sins from past lives,

1182
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,790
reducing its burden from one life to the next.

1183
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:08,801
Where'd you get that?

1184
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,302
Junk mail.

1185
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,580
You know what I think?

1186
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,512
I think we get this one life, I do, and...

1187
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,419
You account for what you've done in it.

1188
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,682
And if you don't, you pay for it when you die.

1189
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,816
You don't think?

1190
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,827
Shit.

1191
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:46,163
Shit shit, son of a bitch. Fuck fuck.

1192
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,864
- Okay, I get it. - Motherfucker.

1193
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,102
Why don't you make me another fucking drink, you cocksucker?

1194
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,054
Who is that?

1195
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:05,685
Hello.

1196
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,725
I'll take care of this.

1197
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:10,794
Will you just pick up the phone sometimes?

1198
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:11,857
Oh, Mrs. Creeson, please,

1199
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:13,365
- Really. - Pick up the phone when you're here?

1200
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,195
- This is inappropriate. - Hi, Mrs. Mabry.

1201
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,200
- Did you get my messages, Mrs. Mabry? - Look, I'm sorry, please.

1202
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,361
Young lady, I'm going to take you to your car. Let's go.

1203
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,537
Look, I'm a little bit worried.

1204
01:18:20,538 --> 01:18:21,701
I don't care if you've been worried.

1205
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:22,657
You've been worried? I...

1206
01:18:22,658 --> 01:18:24,208
...understand if you're worried, Mrs. Creeson.

1207
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,657
But try and have a little patience.

1208
01:18:25,658 --> 01:18:27,245
Get in the fucking car and get out of here.

1209
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:29,041
What's wrong with you? Why are you being like this?

1210
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,878
And what's wrong with my husband, huh?

1211
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,018
Please-

1212
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,380
You're not supposed to be here.

1213
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:34,586
What did you tell him about us?

1214
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,518
There is no us. Get the fuck out of here.

1215
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:37,868
I just needed a friend to talk to.

1216
01:18:37,869 --> 01:18:39,057
Thank you, Mrs. Creeson.

1217
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,217
You've got no fucking idea, man.

1218
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,420
We'll talk at the prison.

1219
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,705
Fucking idiot.

1220
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:02,679
Inexcusable, coming to our home like that.

1221
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,286
You know, we can't alter

1222
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,915
reports once they've been submitted for review.

1223
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,426
I know, I know, but I made a mistake.

1224
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,029
Ehh, you're only human.

1225
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:21,191
Mitch, I-I-I'm asking, please. Please.

1226
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:25,770
The hearing's in an hour. You're kidding, right?

1227
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,271
I know.

1228
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,103
I need a little something more to go on here.

1229
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,609
I can't go into it.

1230
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:36,546
I just missed something. I made a... I made a mistake.

1231
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,914
If you want to plead your concerns, it's fine,

1232
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,817
or if you want to submit additional evidence, that's okay too.

1233
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:45,618
But you know as well as I do his fate's already been determined.

1234
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,283
It's luck and quotas.

1235
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,295
Nothing I say will make a difference?

1236
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,071
Well, don't sweat it, Jack.

1237
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:00,298
I mean, you're less than a month to go. Sleep easy.

1238
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,464
All right.

1239
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:09,312
I'm going out.

1240
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:11,309
What about the Creeson hearing?

1241
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,919
Thanks, Paul.

1242
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,336
Revelation 3:20.

1243
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,998
"Behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man open the door,

1244
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,975
I will come into him and sup with him and he with me. "

1245
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,875
Revelation 3:20.

1246
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:42,947
All right, the next one is...

1247
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,951
It says Christ died for the ungodly.

1248
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:51,489
Yeah, that's in Romans, Chapter 5.

1249
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:54,389
8...

1250
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:03,059
So we're getting to the Commandments next,

1251
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,535
I guess, huh?

1252
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,579
Do you believe in all this?

1253
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,721
What?

1254
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:24,387
Do you?

1255
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:32,261
You read the meditation.

1256
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:47,908
"What request is on the top of my prayer list for today?

1257
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:52,041
Is it a selfish request or one that will bring God glory?"

1258
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:55,188
I know what I want. How about you?

1259
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:01,251
You lost your place again.

1260
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:08,926
You have something you want to say to me?

1261
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:13,103
You don't?

1262
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,732
I can't even think of what you'd want me to say.

1263
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,994
You want to talk about it, man?

1264
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,754
What's that?

1265
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,659
- Her comin'... - Hmm?

1266
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,494
...or me going or anything you want.

1267
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,693
Look, I'm a little concerned about you, man.

1268
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,533
You're seeming a little ragged to me.

1269
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:23,507
Yeah well, put your mind at ease.

1270
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,804
So that's it for us, huh?

1271
01:23:25,968 --> 01:23:28,847
You want to ask me any more questions or go over some shit?

1272
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,348
I'll sit in the chair, we can do that thing, you know.

1273
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:32,813
You'd better be smart or

1274
01:23:32,814 --> 01:23:35,045
you're gonna be right back in here again.

1275
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,383
Hey, I got my release, Jack.

1276
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:40,720
You ain't got to concern yourself about me no more, man.

1277
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,362
You got it, all right, but make no mistake:

1278
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:44,998
I can have 'em watch your goddamn ass 24 hours a day.

1279
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,496
You got me?

1280
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,157
I got you.

1281
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,370
Shit, man, you don't believe in nothing, do you?

1282
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,738
I believe you're one fucked up son of a bitch.

1283
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:58,494
I know you don't believe in me,

1284
01:23:58,495 --> 01:24:00,244
but you don't believe in yourself.

1285
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,541
You don't believe in God.

1286
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,583
I don't think you feel that anything is true inside of you.

1287
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:07,152
I'll give you true-

1288
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:09,061
I'm glad you're out of my hair,

1289
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:09,880
Gerald Creeson.

1290
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,056
Now you can be somebody else's headache.

1291
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,325
Man, life is just taking you by the neck,

1292
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:21,058
and rattling your whole frame

1293
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,396
and you don't know which way is up.

1294
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,267
It's scary as shit when the wheels come off like that, man.

1295
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,032
I feel you. I've been there.

1296
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:32,235
I mean it. But that's when you got to start listening, man.

1297
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,244
Where the fuck is she?

1298
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,110
You don't want to shoot the shit with me anymore, man?

1299
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,614
I'm gonna miss shootin' the shit with you.

1300
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:39,252
Not me, boy, not me. Time for you to go.

1301
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,183
I've enjoyed choppin' it up with you, man.

1302
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:45,119
Anybody here yet?

1303
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,123
Hey, just keep listenin', Jack.

1304
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:49,853
That's all I'm saying, 'cause I think something's coming for you,

1305
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:53,397
but when it comes, man, just stay open to it, you know.

1306
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:56,035
- Don't close it off. - Here we go.

1307
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:57,295
In there.

1308
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,117
Well, happy day.

1309
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,325
So, well, can I kiss her?

1310
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,325
Ready?

1311
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,268
Yeah.

1312
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,677
Well, good luck to you, Stone.

1313
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,848
Hey, I want to thank you.

1314
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,885
Seriously, I appreciate everything that you've done for me.

1315
01:26:21,043 --> 01:26:22,522
Yep.

1316
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:28,356
Good luck to you too, Mrs. Creeson.

1317
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,691
Lucetta, Jack. I mean, we're all friends here, right?

1318
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,390
Lucetta. Take good care of him.

1319
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,629
I will. And you take good care too, old man.

1320
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:42,475
See you later, Jack.

1321
01:26:47,002 --> 01:26:50,040
Oh, hey, you know, I meant to say,

1322
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,550
Lucetta, she did tell me that you fucked her.

1323
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,114
I know that must be against

1324
01:26:56,115 --> 01:26:57,857
some kind of rules around here, right?

1325
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:00,220
I knew what you two were doing.

1326
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,543
Oh, did you know what you

1327
01:27:01,544 --> 01:27:03,727
were doing when you let my wife suck your cock?

1328
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,996
- Good luck to you. - I'll see you out on the bricks.

1329
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:08,828
Good luck to you.

1330
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,665
Right now we enjoy the Constitutional freedom

1331
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:16,708
to keep and bear arms. If that were ever infringed,

1332
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:21,280
if that were ever repealed or just flat out violated and...

1333
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,906
Madylyn?

1334
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:28,247
As a Christian, would we be within our rights,

1335
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,583
because Thomas Jefferson says

1336
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,270
these rights are inalienable

1337
01:27:32,271 --> 01:27:34,284
because they come from our creator...

1338
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:35,951
Madylyn?

1339
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:38,257
...within our rights as Christians

1340
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,108
to revolt against the government

1341
01:27:40,109 --> 01:27:45,598
and its denial of those fundamental Constitutional rights,

1342
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,674
or would a Christian

1343
01:27:47,675 --> 01:27:49,971
have to respond differently?

1344
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,368
- Some mail. - We would have to respond.

1345
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:56,277
And we as Christians would have to rise up

1346
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,975
against any government that said

1347
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:02,145
we didn't have a right to protect ourselves, because-

1348
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,721
I guess I would ask the question,

1349
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:06,587
why do they want to take our guns away from us?

1350
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,853
I like you.

1351
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,334
I like you, Jack.

1352
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,801
I would never fuck you if I didn't want to.

1353
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,642
Madylyn!

1354
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:43,612
Wake up! Wake up! Madylyn!

1355
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,615
Madylyn, wake up! Wake up!

1356
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,458
Come on!

1357
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,836
- I got to get to a phone. - Where are you gonna go?

1358
01:31:04,993 --> 01:31:06,336
- What about Steve and Helen? - No, they're away.

1359
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:08,474
- Well, what about David? - It's too far. It's too late.

1360
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:13,305
Look at this! Oh my G-

1361
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:17,450
Oh God.

1362
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:21,314
You motherfucker!

1363
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,922
God damn it. God damn it!

1364
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:25,353
- Don't say that. - What?

1365
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,515
Taking the Lord's name- stop that.

1366
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,686
- Jesus, Madylyn, please. - Stop it! I won't stand for it!

1367
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:32,593
What are you talking about, for Christ's sakes?

1368
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:33,726
This means something to me.

1369
01:31:33,727 --> 01:31:35,166
It may not mean anything to you anymore,

1370
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,996
- but it means something to me! - Jesus, Madylyn,

1371
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,160
we just almost got incinerated in our sleep

1372
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,466
by some fucking nutjob who I let out,

1373
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:44,007
and you're fucking bothering me about my fucking language?

1374
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,304
- Nobody did this to us! - Give me a fucking break!

1375
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:48,379
- Nobody did this to us. - What?!

1376
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:50,174
It wasn't anybody. It was an act of God.

1377
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,648
I've got a pretty good fucking idea who did this to us.

1378
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:55,515
This was an act of God. I'm going to tell the firemen that.

1379
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,784
What are you talking about, Madylyn?

1380
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:02,292
About the frayed wiring in the kitchen wall.

1381
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,293
What are you talking about? What wire?

1382
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:06,329
In the kitchen wall.

1383
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:09,230
And the- the basement.

1384
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:11,371
- What? - There are all those rag-

1385
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,200
rags down there, all those old rags.

1386
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,206
I'm gonna tell them to go down there.

1387
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,575
Why would you say that?

1388
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:26,715
Because it's as good a story as any.

1389
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:10,362
It's not that sunny out.

1390
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:12,293
Everybody knows

1391
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:15,435
you can still get sunburned on a cloudy day.

1392
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,874
Ah, look at the barns.

1393
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:26,774
Remember that?

1394
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,779
Not really.

1395
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:35,921
I don't know how you stuck it out as long as you did.

1396
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,118
I think you'd have done this sooner.

1397
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:45,554
I almost did once.

1398
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:49,768
So what happened?

1399
01:34:00,068 --> 01:34:02,480
What happened?

1400
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:08,414
He's free! Yeah! He's free!

1401
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:14,457
That's a free man there, huh?

1402
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:37,982
You do not want to make it a two-way conversation with them,

1403
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:42,178
because they have nothing on their minds but-

1404
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,186
well, they may have nothin' but time

1405
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,791
to just think about ways to work on you

1406
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,791
and to get under your skin.

1407
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,021
You cannot make yourself a person to them.

1408
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,359
Oh, believe me, I've learned that lesson.

1409
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,202
Well, I mean, they'll test you for sure.

1410
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,839
A good lookin' woman like you...

1411
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,875
Oh, Jack.

1412
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:08,036
Well, I'm-

1413
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,082
I'm retired, I'm not dead, you know.

1414
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:13,536
Come on, Jack, we're friends, okay?

1415
01:35:13,537 --> 01:35:14,083
You're the best.

1416
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:16,222
I wanna have a little fun.

1417
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,153
Send me off into the sunset.

1418
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,361
Let's just keep it pro, okay?

1419
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:30,030
You want to be a pro?

1420
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:33,536
Fuck pro. They're gonna fucking chew your ass up in there.

1421
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:35,697
- Okay, Jack, that's enough. - No no, it's bullshit.

1422
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,070
Jerking my chain like that, you fucking cunt.

1423
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:41,339
- Gimme some respect. - Hey, buddy, let's throw some darts.

1424
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:43,175
Yeah yeah, I'm in.

1425
01:35:43,338 --> 01:35:46,114
- Up yours. - Whoa whoa whoa, buddy, hey.

1426
01:35:46,274 --> 01:35:49,551
I'm just fucked up. I should go.

1427
01:35:49,711 --> 01:35:52,749
- No, ride with me. - No, I'm-I'm gonna get a cab.

1428
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,689
I'm good, I'm good. I'm gonna get a cab.

1429
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:58,763
I'm good, word of honor. I'm good. It's a cab.

1430
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,201
...get us to the reality that God has already deemed is going to happen,

1431
01:36:03,358 --> 01:36:06,430
and nothing is going to change that.

1432
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:09,473
And so it's not like there is this cosmic battle

1433
01:36:09,631 --> 01:36:14,277
between good and evil, and good might not triumph.

1434
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,938
The reality is that there is a battle going on

1435
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:20,643
where you would see a huge boxer

1436
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:22,481
holding a guy's head back,

1437
01:36:22,644 --> 01:36:25,784
and the little scrawny guy is flailing his arms,

1438
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:28,393
waving at the guy, trying to beat him.

1439
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:31,894
That's exactly what God- God has Satan subdued,

1440
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:33,964
but in the flailing of his arms-

1441
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:37,228
and this is particularly brought out in Revelation, Chapter 12-

1442
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:41,898
Satan flailing his arms is able to do an awfui lot of chaos

1443
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:44,634
and damage and bad things happen.

1444
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:47,006
And it's because he is enraged

1445
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:49,079
because he knows his time is short.

1446
01:36:49,237 --> 01:36:50,648
Revelation 12 said that.

1447
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:07,163
This is some shit, man.

1448
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:08,665
Wait whoa!

1449
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:12,104
You ruined my whole life. Why?

1450
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,264
Fucking why? Why?

1451
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,205
Why what?

1452
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:19,174
Why did you do if?

1453
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,511
Why did you...

1454
01:37:28,543 --> 01:37:31,046
Okay okay okay okay.

1455
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:34,393
Hey, man,

1456
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,187
you ain't gonna do this.

1457
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,562
You think I won't?

1458
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,333
You think I won't?

1459
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:50,537
You think I won't?

1460
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,735
You think I won't?!

1461
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:07,884
No.

1462
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,727
No, I don't.

1463
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:41,424
Yeah, at first, I thought I was crazy.

1464
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:43,619
Was this really happening to me?

1465
01:38:43,785 --> 01:38:46,595
Was it all in my head, or is there really a God

1466
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,098
who can breathe life into me

1467
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:51,533
and make me feel his presence?

1468
01:38:51,692 --> 01:38:55,265
So this is actually what encouraged me to write the book.

1469
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:59,037
And honestly it completely changed the way that I look at life...

1470
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,771
Assume that there was a Higher Power,

1471
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,574
that It created the universe,

1472
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:06,810
until God set a bush on fire...

1473
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,647
And maybe I did.

1474
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,949
...and said, "Oh, by the way, you were right. "

1475
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,961
You know, and...

1476
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:28,004
I think- I think I'm ready to get out.

1477
01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:30,768
Next up here is Gerald from southwest Detroit.

1478
01:39:30,932 --> 01:39:33,173
- Welcome, Gerald. - I just want to say,

1479
01:39:33,334 --> 01:39:35,837
I got this book and they say that

1480
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:38,779
when you experience a spiritual truth,

1481
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,920
that it comes to you through sound.

1482
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:44,249
If you let this sound go through you,

1483
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:47,484
it changes you, you know?

1484
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:50,322
It puts you back into harmony,

1485
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:54,297
you know, makes you like a tuning fork of God.

1486
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:55,832
Okay.

1487
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,971
Yeah, they say they say it can start with small things

1488
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:02,471
like little vibrations- you know, the sound of a bee,

1489
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:05,167
the sound of a buzzing light. And then it grows.

1490
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,609
All right, that's interesting.

1491
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:09,839
Well, they say

1492
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,450
that everything that happens to you

1493
01:40:12,607 --> 01:40:16,180
is what was supposed to happen to you for you to advance,

1494
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:18,881
that you've got to come back lots of times,

1495
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:22,220
you know, cycle through many lives until you learn, until you...

1496
01:40:23,618 --> 01:40:25,620
Well, thanks for your input.

1497
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:29,029
Next up here on the WDDL listener line is

1498
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,774
Kathy in Farmington Hills.

1499
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,535
You're on All Voices Under God.
