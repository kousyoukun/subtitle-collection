1
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,834
刚那是非常短的一杆推杆
It was a very short putt.

2
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,192
鉴于之前一洞已多于标准杆一杆
It would seem routine had

3
00:00:32,193 --> 00:00:34,343
这一杆反而显得有些剑走偏锋
he not just come off a bogey the hole before.

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,744
失误在先显然令他有些沮丧
Mm-hmm, obviously smarting from that.

5
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,886
不过我们来看看这一杆他怎么处理
But let's see what he does here.

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,988
教科书般完美无缺  完美无缺
Oh perfect. Textbook, textbook.

7
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,182
现在去看看第七球道上李・特拉维诺的情况
We move ahead now to Lee Trevino on the fairway at the seventh.

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,726
从他的杆底角看  似乎下方草皮有断片
His lie looks as though he may be in a little divot.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,388
显然如此  巡回赛官员正在严加斥责
Absolutely. Tournament officials have been cracking down

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,398
负责填补的球童
on caddies filling in the divots.

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,657
在这样高水平的比赛中
At this level of the game,

12
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,561
高尔夫的规范制度也愈加彰显
some of us gotta watch the etiquette of golf.

13
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,949
睡吧
Just go to sleep.

14
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,775
漂亮的近距切球
A lovely approach.

15
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,078
他在斟酌  我想这般优秀...
He's considering it now. I presume that a player like...

16
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,346
沙杆还是中号劈起杆
Sand wedge or intermediate pitching wedge.

17
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,109
真让人激动  他正在瞄准
Oh, very exciting. He's lining up the shot.

18
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,287
看着我
Look at me.

19
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,423
什么
Hmm?

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,121
我受不了了
I'm not standing for this.

21
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,266
什么
Sorry?

22
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,363
你禁锢了我的灵魂
You keep my soul in a dungeon.

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
我要离开你
I'm leaving.

24
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,012
杰克
Jack?

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,329
-杰克  -你走我就把她扔下去
- Jack. - If you leave me, I'll throw her.

26
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,966
你觉得我不敢是吗
You think that I won't, hmm?

27
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,335
-求你了  -你觉得我不敢是吗
- Please. - Do you think I won't?!

28
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,799
我不走  不离开你
I won't leave. I won't leave you.

29
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,756
对不起  别再那样做
I'm sorry. Don't ever do that again.

30
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,557
别离开我  别再那样做
Don't ever leave me. Don't ever do that again.

31
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,009
光明美丽遍大地
All things bright and beautiful.

32
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,381
浩瀚渺小皆苍生
All creatures great and small.

33
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,422
聪慧美好满人间
All things wise and wonderful.

34
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,359
上主慈悲万物生
The Lord God made them all.

35
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,555
请各位就座
I invite you to be seated at this time.

36
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,200
非常漂亮的补杆
Oh, that's a very nice touch.

37
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,639
那或许他可以保住标准杆
So maybe he can make a par. And at worse from there

38
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,437
之后再糟糕应该也能保住总杆数标准杆
you'd think he could stay his point total.

39
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,377
他现在却在这个标准三杆的洞使用七号铁杆
Now here we find him with a 7-iron at this par-3 hole.

40
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:31,377
铁杆：用金属做的杆，用作中距离的击球
杆号越小，球击得越远

41
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,270
我不知道是不是他右脚打滑的原因
I don't know if there was a problem with him slippin' with

42
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,258
但那绝对应该是个左旋球
his right foot there, but definitely a pull.

43
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,120
显然他心中早有打算
He obviously had the thought in his head

44
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,955
想要出其不意
that he needed to give it a little bit extra,

45
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,427
如今却陷入困境
and he's found himself in a difficult spot.

46
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,658
他对这场比赛的全部期望...
All the expectations he had coming into this,

47
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,939
-喂  -杰克
- Hello? - Jack.

48
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,807
贝西
Betsy.

49
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,607
你哥哥去世了
Your brother slipped away.

50
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,320
终于脱离苦海了
Finally out of his misery.

51
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,683
-是的  -我懂  我懂
- Yes, he is. - Oh, I know, I know.

52
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,135
我一次次听到这样的话语
And how many times did I hear,

53
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:14,985
"你为什么不能像你哥哥鲍比那样"
"Why can't you be like your brother Bobby"?

54
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,527
要是每听一次这句话我就有一毛钱进帐
If I had a nickel for every time that was said to me...

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,626
想必我也发达了
I'd be a rich man today.

56
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,168
对于他前额上的那一块伤疤
That scar on his forehead that he had,

57
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,205
他总能讲出一个渊源
he always had a story for it,

58
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,415
但其实罪魁祸首是我
but it was me.

59
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,673
我八岁时砸了这位完美先生一锤头
I threw a hammer at Mr. Perfect when I was eight.

60
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,042
但为了庇护他爱的人  他绝口不提  
He never told though. He covered for the people he loved.

61
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,515
我爱着这样的他  他就是这样一个人
That's how he was and I loved him for that.

62
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,154
我希望能像他一样
And I wanted to be like him.

63
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,051
方方面面
Everything-

64
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,362
我只想说...
I just want to say that...

65
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,172
若不是鲍比  我...
If it wasn't for Bobby, I'd...

66
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,005
我不知道...
I- I don't know...

67
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,514
自己会是何种境地
Where I would've wound up.

68
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,213
他教会我生活  明辨是非
He taught me how to live, what was right.

69
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,182
我会怀念他
I'm gonna miss him.

70
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,592
他一生无憾  一生无憾  他...
He lived right. He lived right. He was...

71
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:30,565
人生至此  夫复何求
What more could you s- want people to say about you?

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,671
圣经通篇描述上帝如何公正
All throughout Scripture it talks about God being a just God.

73
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,946
可我刚读了一个寓言  
I mean, I just read the parable

74
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,677
讲述了一个女人不停地前来诉说
about the unjust judge,

75
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,749
其中的决断就有失公允
where the woman kept coming and coming and saying...

76
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,079
关怀  爱意  宽容
Caring, loving, forgiving...

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,915
我怀疑你是否真心赞同那些言论
I'm wondering if you concur with what you've heard so far?

78
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,956
我认为关于选择  关于自由意志...
I think that the choices, the idea of free will,

79
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,060
以及我们有选择的自由...
and the fact that we have freedom of choice...

80
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,101
如今我们生活的时代
The reality of the times we live in,

81
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,190
充斥着焦躁和不安
this notion that- this angst

82
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,743
片名:  《色狱心机》

83
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,736
举国上下多少人内心波澜起伏
that a lot of people are feeling in this country,

84
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,145
忧心于我们经历了某种根本性转变
that we've gone through some sort of fundamental transformation...

85
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,927
今日早些时候
"Barack Obama earlier today,

86
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,222
巴拉克・奥巴马将其五个月前
crediting his so-called stimulus package

87
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,618
签署的所谓刺激计划标榜为
that he signed four or five months ago,

88
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,784
"把现金送进纳税人的口袋"
as "Putting cash into the pockets of taxpayers. "

89
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,954
如果作为底特律地区的纳税人的您
If you're a taxpayer in the Detroit area

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,565
拿到了刺激计划送来的现金
who got cash in your pocket from the stimulus plan,

91
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,545
请打电话给我
I'd love to hear from ya,

92
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:37,963
当然您也可以通过网络联系我们
and you can also check in via the internet,

93
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,967
但我们期待听到您的亲口描述
but we would love to hear from you personally.

94
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,346
沃伦市的凯文  接通凯文
Kevin in Warren. We go to Kevin.

95
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:42,606
凯文  感谢来电
Kevin thanks so much for calling.

96
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,070
非常荣幸
Welcome.

97
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,078
你好  帕姆
Hi, Pam.

98
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,021
谢谢
Thanks.

99
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,157
不  是真的
No, it's true.

100
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,058
上帝作证  我改过自新了
With God is my witness, I've changed.

101
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,495
以耶稣和家人的名义...
With Jesus and my family...

102
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,857
主啊  以前的事我很后悔
Oh my God, I'm sorry for what I've done.

103
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,892
搞了把玩具枪把酒品店给抢了
I mean, I robbed a goddamn liquor store with a toy gun.

104
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,054
哪个傻帽干这种蠢事啊
What kinda- what kinda idiot does that?

105
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,783
监狱长找你
Warden wants to see you.

106
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,556
你好  艾利
Hi, Allie.

107
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,859
-你好  米曲  杰尼斯  -杰克
- Hi, Mitch. Janice. - Jack.

108
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,264
-什么事  -关门  杰克
- What's up? - Shut the door, Jack.

109
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,239
这个叫迪肖恩・麦克尼的
This Deshawn Mackey guy.

110
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,347
由你负责  这是你的报告  对吧
This is yours? Your report, right?

111
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,120
对  怎么了
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

112
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,812
简直一团糟  杰克
It's an incompetent mess, Jack.

113
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,788
我知道你的心早就飞到高尔夫球场上了
I mean, look, I know your head's already out on the golf course,

114
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,157
但这份报告简直是有辱斯文
but this is a travesty of proper casework here.

115
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,262
-骗到你了  -确实
- I got ya. - You got me.

116
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,309
给  跟言简意赅的大师学学
Here. Learn from the master of understatement.

117
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,946
-一定  -要简洁
- Absolutely. - Keep 'em brief.

118
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,411
得趁你走人之前
Now I need to get Janice

119
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,811
让杰尼斯熟悉起来
up to speed before you're out the back door,

120
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,352
所以就把你手上未定的审核都交给她吧
so let's pass all your indeterminates eligible off to her.

121
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,753
好的  当然  但我手头已经审核的案子
Yeah yeah, of course, but I'd like to stay on my currents,

122
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,985
我想坚持做完他们的复查阶段  可以吗
if I can see them through to review- is that okay?

123
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,761
当然  只要你愿意
Yeah, if you're willing.

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,365
-我很愿意  谢谢  -好的
- I would like to. Thank you. - Yeah.

125
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,968
-没事了  -好
- We're good. - Okay.

126
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,196
节哀顺变
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

127
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,965
什么
Excuse me?

128
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,370
你哥哥  我才听说  请节哀顺变
Your brother- I just recently heard, I'm sorry.

129
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,307
多谢关心
Thank you.

130
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,145
-好的  -好
- Okay. - Yeah.

131
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,048
石头
S- Stone.

132
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,153
什么
Hmm?

133
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,050
不是  我叫石头
No, I-I'm Stone.

134
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,215
我知道文件里写的"杰拉德"
I mean, I know it say "Gerald" In the file,

135
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,328
但我更喜欢石头这个名号
but I'm just saying I prefer Stone.

136
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,732
杰拉德・科里森
Gerald Creeson.

137
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,397
石头算怎么回事  外号吗
So what's Stone, like a nickname?

138
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,227
是监狱里的外号吗
That's something from here?

139
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,096
不  不是  老兄  让那帮湃巳ニ
No. Oh no, man. Fuck ail these assholes.

140
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,569
那些认得我的人才这么叫我
Yo, that's what my people call me. You know, people who know me.

141
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,007
我们不会就这样
Look, are we just gonna,

142
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,070
拿张表勾勾叉叉吧?
like- are you just gonna tick the boxes and shit?

143
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,681
就不能有话直说吗
I mean, can we- can we talk straight?

144
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,481
你到底帮不帮我出去
I mean, you gonna help me out or what?

145
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,909
你懂不懂  我觉得
'Cause I, you know, I don't think

146
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,131
这破牢我已经蹲够本儿了
I deserve to be up in here no more.

147
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,247
说慢点  慢点  慢点
Let's just slow down. Slow slow down.

148
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,719
我磨了够久了  再来三年也不能...
I've done a long bid, man. Three more years ain't gonna-

149
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,757
说慢点  来谈谈你为什么来蹲牢吧
Slow down. Let's - let's talk about what got you here.

150
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,809
来讲讲吧
You want to tell me about that?

151
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,758
不就在你面前吗
It's right there in front of you.

152
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,422
干嘛还要说一遍
Why you want to talk about that again?

153
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,363
因为现在你攥在我手里
'Cause now you're mine.

154
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,260
你进入下一级审核了
You moved up.

155
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,423
还有  我就是喜欢聊天
And just 'cause I like to chat.

156
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,673
里面那帮二逼
All these scrubs in here,

157
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,537
那帮短刑期的  还有那些软柿子
you know, these short-timers and meatballs,

158
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,900
都装出一副被冤枉的样子  对不对
they're like, they're all innocent, right?

159
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,702
至少我承认了
Yeah. But at least I admit it.

160
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,708
我当时就承认了自己的罪过
You know, I copped to what I did right away,

161
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,143
现在该往前看了  老兄
and-and now I'm lookin' forward, man.

162
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,283
我外面有工作等着  我就不明白了
I got a job lined up and I'm sayin',

163
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,544
这种屁话要说多少遍才算个头
why I got to talk about that shit every fuckin' time?

164
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,449
因为我想听你自己说出来  没其他原因
'Cause I want to hear your side of it, that's why.

165
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,453
猜怎么着  操他妈的狗屁事  操你妈
You know what? Just fuck this shit. Fuck you too.

166
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,888
-我他妈没空陪你玩  -小子
- I ain't got time for this bullshit. - Hey, son-

167
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,426
你丫压根就没想让我通过
No, you're just settin' them up so they can flop me, man.

168
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,655
你爱写什么随便写  不同意就不同意吧
So you write what you're gonna write and let's just get on with it, man.

169
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,765
-哥无所谓  -小子  石头
- 'Cause I'll take the flop. - Hey, son. Stone.

170
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,298
-你写啊  写不同意啊  写啊  -小子  别激动
- Go ahead, max me, max me. - Son, calm down.

171
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,402
你以为我怕你啊  随你他妈怎么写
You don't think I'll do it, I'll see that max standing

172
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,662
-哥才不怕你  -石头
- on my fucking head, man. - Stone!

173
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,464
出去以后有你好看  贱人
I'll see you outside before you see me, bitch.

174
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,774
石头  两秒以后  
Stone!

175
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,425
你他妈就会回牢里蹲着
In about two fucking seconds you're gonna go in the hole,

176
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,575
而你的档案也会被压在最底下
and your file is gonna go to the bottom of my pile.

177
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,476
明白吗  看见面前那扇门没
You understand? You see that door in front of you?

178
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,947
你知道出门意味着什么  回监狱
You know where it goes- back.

179
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,017
你想重回监狱  随便你
You want to go back? Be my guest.

180
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,655
想开始新生活  想出去看新世界
You want to go forward, you want to walk out of here,

181
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,189
想找到那扇门吗  我  我就是那扇门
you want to find that door? Me, I'm that door.

182
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,513
你得通过我
And you will go through me.

183
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,328
哪怕我问起天气
If I ask you a question about the weather,

184
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,532
你他妈也得乖乖回答
you better fucking answer it

185
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,464
否则咱们三年后再见
or go back and I'll see you in three years.

186
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,997
-明白没  -明白
- You got it? - Yeah.

187
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,761
-那你他妈就坐下  -好
- Then sit the fuck down. - All right.

188
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,303
都没事了
Well, we just shootin' the shit.

189
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,511
我喜欢她  够劲儿
I like her, man. She's hard.

190
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,318
好  行了  听我说
Okay. All right, look,

191
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,685
程序就是这样
look, this is a process.

192
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,849
我们聊聊
We talk.

193
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,553
我们不是朋友  那就装成朋友  好吗
We're not friends, but just pretend we're friends, okay?

194
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,858
放松  随便聊聊  就这样
Relax, just-just talk, that's all,

195
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,524
说不定咱们就能各得其所  好吗
and then maybe we both get what we want, okay?

196
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,035
-行  那就装吧  -好
- Okay, let's pretend. - Okay.

197
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,867
你结婚了
You're married.

198
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,031
对
Yeah.

199
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,836
那很好
Okay, that's good.

200
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,376
你结婚多久了
How long are you married?

201
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,572
九年了  八年就在这儿耗了
Nine years, man- eight of it up in this shit.

202
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,514
材料里写过了  老兄  我不想...
It's right in the file, man. I don't want-

203
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,355
说说你的妻子
Let's talk about your wife.

204
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,752
-露西塔  -对
- Lucetta? - Mm-hmm, yeah.

205
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,824
-她来过这里没  你见过她没  -没有
- Has she come up here? You seen her? - No.

206
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,656
-她正点到爆  兄弟  -什么意思
- She's a dime, dawg. - What's a dime?

207
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,820
完美情人  她很好
Perfect 10, man. She's fine.

208
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,400
我偷偷跟你说
I'll tell you, between you and me,

209
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,400
她很不同一般
she's-she's a alien.

210
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,232
不同一般  她是外国来的非法移民吗
Alien? What do you mean, like an illegal?

211
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,069
不  不是非法移民  她比你还白呢
No, she ain't illegal, man. She's whiter than you.

212
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,336
她就像是  就像是
No, she's like- she's like a-

213
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,912
从另一个世界来的
she's an alien from another world, man.

214
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,884
她常来看你吗  周六给你带便当吗
She visit you much? Picnics most Saturdays?

215
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,114
我讨厌便当  我喜欢干她
I don't want no picnic, man. I miss my dick in her fuckin' ass.

216
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,589
我无比怀念口交时那种欲仙欲死的感觉
You know, I miss her suckin' me till I can't take no more.

217
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,524
她疯的很  什么都肯做
I mean, she's crazy. She'll do anything.

218
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,977
乳交  颜射都无所谓
Fuck her tits, come in her face,

219
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,756
她也就眨眨眼  笑个不停
she'll just blink and keep on laughing, man.

220
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,366
她就是...
It's- she-

221
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,949
你要真想聊露西塔
look, if we gonna talk about Lucetta,

222
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,764
可得做好心理准备
you better watch out,

223
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,598
接下来给你描述的事儿
'cause I'm gonna give you some pictures in your head

224
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,740
估计要让你性奋得好几夜睡不着了
gonna keep you up nights, man.

225
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,143
不会吧
Oh man.

226
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,443
对不起  对不起  我说话漏风  我知道
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I- I got a mouth, I know.

227
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,609
我的错  老兄  你现在看我那眼神 
I apologize, man. You're givin' me that look,

228
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,484
感觉就像是审核到此为止了
and I feel like you go down here and that's the end of this shit.

229
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,626
这样  我可不想惹你
Look, I don't want no beef with you.

230
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,658
我好好待着
I just want to be vegetarian.

231
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,468
那是你老婆吗
Is that your wife? You're married?

232
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,334
对
Yeah.

233
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,338
-很久了吗  -四十三年了
- A long time? - 43 years.

234
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,670
不会吧
Get the fuck out.

235
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,313
看来是真爱了
Man, that's true love, huh?

236
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,293
真好  四十三年了
That's great, and after 43 years

237
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,313
还有激情干柴烈火什么的
and you still get it on and everything?

238
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,817
-你说什么  -不是  我是真好奇
- Excuse me? - No, I'm really curious about this.

239
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,818
是这样  我爱我的马子
It's like, say, I love my lady, right,

240
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,423
但有时候想想
but, you know, I wonder sometimes,

241
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,084
要是她以后满身满脸的褶子可怎么办
like how you gonna do when the skin starts to go to the crepe,

242
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,866
你明白我意思吗
you know what I'm sayin'? I mean,

243
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,629
你一般怎么搞
what do- how does that work for you?

244
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,428
要吃点伟哥硬起来还是怎样
Like you get hip to Viagra, so you can like hammer nails with it?

245
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,220
等等  你听好
Listen listen, look, I don't

246
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,664
我不跟人这样讨论我老婆
talk with anybody about my wife like that.

247
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,672
我没说你老婆  我在说我自己
I ain't talkin' about your wife. I'm sayin', for me,

248
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,674
我关在这里很多年了
you know, I've been locked up a long time.

249
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,817
现在让我去干
You don't need much more

250
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,541
估计没两下就不行了
than two pumps and a swirl to get it done.

251
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,148
嘴巴干净点
I don't consider this polite conversation.

252
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,116
我没想显粗鲁  我只想知道
I ain't tryin' to be rude, okay? I really want to know

253
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,277
你能量释放到哪里
where does that go?

254
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,890
或者说发泄到哪里
Or where do you put it, if you-

255
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,719
你懂我的意思不
you get what I'm sayin'?

256
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,328
我想知道你怎么处理这事
I want to know how it works for you,

257
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,054
怎么把那把火压住
how you keep a lid on that.

258
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,393
现在不是谈我的时候
We're not- we're not talking about me.

259
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,366
不谈我  懂不懂
We're not talking about me, okay?

260
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,329
人类看表象
Man looks on the outward appearance.

261
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,736
上帝看心灵
God looks on the heart.

262
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,242
当然人的心灵确实很重要
And certainly the heart of a man does matter,

263
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,710
因为口中所言皆由心生
because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks...

264
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,700
选择是上帝决意呈现给我们的
Only in the choices that God decides to present to us.

265
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,236
不对  我不是那意思
Well, no, I'm not saying that.

266
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,740
我是说我相信人是有主观能动性的
I'm saying that I just believe that we're automatons...

267
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,532
事情就是这样
...and here's the deal:

268
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,370
-我没有选择出生  -很严肃的
- I did not choose to be born... - This is very very serious.

269
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,706
我也无法选择再出生一次
...and I cannot choose to be born again.

270
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,109
她都四岁了  你相信吗
She's four- can you believe it?

271
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,808
诸如此类的事情上我没有选择权
I had no choice in that matter whatsoever, and yet

272
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,284
-却有很多人...  -你去哪儿了
- there are so many people that... - Where have you gone?

273
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,286
认为他们在灵魂再生
...think they have a choice in the matter

274
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,949
和灵魂形成上可以选择
of their spiritual rebirth and their spiritual formation.

275
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,681
事实上
The fact of the matter is,

276
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,393
生命种子埋下  受孕完成
a seed is planted and conception takes place,

277
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,760
-而你只能顺应天命  -阿门
- which you had nothing to do with. - Amen.

278
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,129
上帝之声  WDDL广播电台
All Voices Under God, WDDL,

279
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,829
几条重要消息后再回来
will continue here right after these very important messages.

280
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,644
当时我们嗑嗨了  想找钱
Look, we was high as shit and we were lookin' for money.

281
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,676
爷爷听到我们的声音
You know? My poppy hears us.

282
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,314
他和迪奇说了几句
Him and Teach have words.

283
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,972
爷爷去别处拿了枪
Poppy goes and gets his gun.

284
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,175
我就想"搞毛  我可不想搀和进来"
And I was like, "Fuck this. I don't want no part of this,"

285
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,978
于是我就出去了
and I went outside.

286
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,022
然后迪奇把事情处理了  房子也烧了
So then, Teach done what he done and then the house got burnt.

287
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,860
实在是...糟透了
It was- you know, it was terrible.

288
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,860
我当时就知道自己犯了大错
I was like a terrible mistake that I made.

289
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,499
悲惨极了但也已经过去很久了
I was tragic and it was a long time ago

290
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,135
我为此付出了...
and I've paid- I've paid...

291
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,634
太长时间的煎熬
With a lot of hard time.

292
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,797
我想现在我准备好出去了
And I just think, you know, I'm so ready to be out

293
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,000
开始新生活
and start my life again,

294
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,441
所以...
and well, so what-

295
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,877
我们要怎怎怎么做才能实现
you know, what-what-what can we do to make that happen?

296
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,482
怎样你才会帮我实现
How can you help me make that happen?

297
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,982
看情况吧
Well, we'll see.

298
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,485
这才刚开始  所以
We were just getting started, so-

299
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,817
我来这里变好了不少  你知道吗
A lot of good things have happened for me in here, you know.

300
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,687
我考了GED[相当于高中水平]
I did my GED like that, man.

301
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,885
我在纺织工厂里改造
I held down this job- Textiles Unit,

302
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,826
过去的两年一直是第一名
number one position the last two years.

303
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,400
我要回家找我的妻子
I'm goin' home to my wife.

304
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,557
她都给我找好工作了
She's got a spot for me, you know,

305
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,506
在埃勒特山的克莱斯勒汽车厂
Mount Elliot Chrysler,

306
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:52,007
工作都准备好了
job lined up.

307
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,506
我想去  你知道吗  
I'm-I'm going, you know.

308
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:54,834
是的  这是谁的主意
Yeah, whose idea was it?

309
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,879
露西塔  她认识
Lucetta- she knows

310
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,133
埃勒特山分店的经理
the branch manager at Mount Elliot.

311
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,673
不  不是你的工作
No no, not your job.

312
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,209
要去你祖父母家是谁的主意
Whose idea was it to go to your grandparent's?

313
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,903
-什么  -是谁的主意
- What? - Whose idea was it?

314
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,043
我告诉过你  我告诉过你  是迪奇
I told you- I told you it was Teach.

315
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,745
迪奇  你知道
Teach, you know.

316
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,391
就像我说的  我甚至没有...
Like I said, I wasn't even...

317
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,754
我一直就在屋子外面
I was...I went outside the house.

318
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,055
是的  但是你没有阻止他们  对吧
Yeah, but you didn't stop them, did you?

319
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,824
-阻止他们什么  -杀害你的祖父母
- Stop 'em what? - From killing your grandparents.

320
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,001
你根本不想让我通过是吧  哥们
You-you-you ain't gonna do it, man.

321
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,534
你不会...
You're not gonna-

322
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,406
你知道个屁啊  见鬼
You don't give a fuck, man. Shit.

323
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,116
我当时在外面
I was outside,

324
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,447
迪奇出来了
Teach...Teach come out,

325
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,023
直到他告诉我  我才知道他做了什么
and I didn't even know what he'd done until he told me.

326
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,592
迪奇都已经作证了  哥们
Teach testified to that, man.

327
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,222
这就是为什么我没有被判谋杀罪
He- that's why I didn't even catch the rap for...for manslaughter.

328
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,628
而只是帮凶和纵火罪
I got accessory and arson.

329
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,293
我已经蹲了八年了
I've done eight out of 10-15.

330
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,601
你们到底想让我怎么样
I mean, what...what more do you want from me?

331
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,546
好吧  这样
Okay, so,

332
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,648
我们要让今天
let's make today

333
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,284
成为又一个异常特殊的日子
an extra special day.

334
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,785
让我们为某人做一件好事
Let's do one nice thing for someone else,

335
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,050
但是不告诉任何人我们做过  好吗
but not tell anyone else that we did it, okay?

336
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:23,996
好的
Okay.

337
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,987
要是拿7-2牌的人赢了  每人给十块钱
Win with the seven-deuce, it's 10 bucks for everybody.

338
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:27,987
7-2  Poker里面最不可能赢的组合
所以必须有特殊规则来保护
否则拿到这种牌的人会直接放弃  也就是fold

339
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,894
分高低彩池都赢的话
Win both ways with the seven-deuce,

340
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,897
-每人二十块  -杰克狂野吗
- 20 bucks a head. - Jack's wild?

341
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,467
他当然不狂野
Jack's definitely not wild.

342
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,504
玛莎  跟进吗
Marsha, stay in?

343
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,072
你好
Hello?

344
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,019
请问这是杰克・玛布里的家吗  
Hi, is this Jack Mabry's place?

345
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,520
什么
Excuse me?

346
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,211
我叫露西塔・科里森  
Oh, my name is Lucetta Creeson.

347
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:42,806
我的丈夫...
My husband's...

348
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,811
对不起  我没听明白
Excuse me, I couldn't understand what-

349
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,189
我想找杰克・玛布里  
Can I speak to Jack Mabry?

350
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,577
我是玛布里夫人
Well, this is Mrs. Mabry.

351
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,312
好的  我能跟杰克对话吗
Okay, can I speak to Jack?

352
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,821
你要找我丈夫的话  我可以给他带个话
You need my husband. I can give him a mess-

353
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,200
-你找到他了吗  -跟他太太说了几句
- Hey, you get ahold of him? - She was a little short.

354
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,839
我也不知道
You know? Like, I don't know.

355
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,973
她好像不想跟我说什么
Like she didn't want to talk or something.

356
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,343
你为什么和她说话呢
Why-why-why you talkin' to her?

357
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,382
嘿  汤米  我们不能咬
Hey, Tommy, Tommy, we don't bite.

358
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,316
不能咬  好吗
Huh-uh, no biting, okay?

359
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,123
你明白我在说什么吗
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

360
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:28,014
我现在需要你帮我
I need you to do this for me right now.

361
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,182
就现在  别让机会溜走
Right now. Don't let it slide.

362
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,488
好的  我会的
Okay, I will.

363
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,495
好吗  今晚给他打电话
Okay? Call him tonight.

364
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,032
明天还给他打  明天晚上还给他打
Call him tomorrow. Call him tomorrow night.

365
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,693
后天还给他打  后天晚上还打
Call him the day after. Call him the day after tomorrow night.

366
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,902
我想知道
That's what I'm getting

367
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,898
你承认你之前做错了吗
at is do you believe what you did was wrong?

368
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,669
你在想什么  就因为我在西部长大
What-what d'you think, because I grew up westside

369
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,813
我就是不能分辨是非的
that like I'm one of these socio-delinquent types,

370
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,813
社会问题青年
don't know the difference between right and wrong?

371
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,418
你想知道我的悲惨童年和狗屎命运吗
You want me to tell you about my bad childhood and shit?

372
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,917
我不知道  你曾经有吗
I don't know. Did you have one?

373
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,414
你知道  在那时  
Well, you know, at the time,

374
00:22:58,415 --> 00:22:59,886
我认为干坏事都是正常的
I thought a lot of shit was normal.

375
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,049
这当然是不对的
It was definitely unhealthy,

376
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,559
但另一方面  我认为
but on the same token, you know, I didn't think

377
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,994
我本身并不坏
I was a bad person to begin with.

378
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,191
所以  我是说  你还想知道什么
So, you know, I mean, what, you want to know

379
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,530
我是否会点燃其他祖父母的房子吗
if I'm gonna light any more grandparents on fire?

380
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,365
-你会吗  -不会
- Are you? - No.

381
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,957
你还有祖父祖母在世吗
You got any more?

382
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,531
还有一个
Yeah, I got one.

383
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,270
那你应该对那位老人好些
Yeah well, try to make a better effort with that one.

384
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,784
我并不是专门来找你麻烦的
I'm not trying to be flip.

385
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,752
我觉得我应该获得自由
I think I deserve to be free, I do.

386
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,791
为什么  就因为你服满刑期了吗
Why, because you did the time?

387
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,775
就这样  你准备好了吗
That's it, you're ready?

388
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:39,759
你现在清白了吗
Now you're a clean slate?

389
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,083
我跟所有人一样清白  哥们  
I'm clean as anybody, man.

390
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:43,093
我跟你一样清白
I'm clean as you.

391
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,895
也许是  也许不是
Well, maybe, maybe not.

392
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,766
真的  我想问问你
Seriously, let me ask you something, you know.

393
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,306
为什么你就能坐在那儿
Why are you- why are you- why are you gonna sit there,

394
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,773
问我这些问题  好像你从来没犯过错
like, asking me these questions like you never done nothin'?

395
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,040
为什么你能自由地进来出去而我就不能
I mean, you know, why do you get to walk around free and I don't?

396
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,944
我从没有犯过罪
I wasn't convicted of a crime.

397
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,982
得了吧  你就没做过坏事
Oh, come on, you never did anything bad?

398
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,929
没有对任何人做过错事
Never did anybody no wrong,

399
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,122

-很高兴见到你  -谢谢
- Nice to meet you. - Thank you.

535
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,822
好了
Okay.

536
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,389
这到底是什么
What the hell is this?

537
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,623
-什么东西  -这个  你妻子给的
- What's that? - This...your wife.

538
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,993
什么  她寄给你的吗
What, she sent it to you?

539
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,294
她刚才在停车场给我的
She gave it to me in the parking lot just now.

540
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,495
等等  什么  露西塔来找你了吗
Wait, what, Lucetta come and find you?

541
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,664
她刚刚在停车场给我的  别想捣乱
She gave that to me in the parking lot. Don't mess with me.

542
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,106
我不想给你带来任何麻烦
I ain't lookin' for any kind of trouble with you, you know.

543
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,142
我希望你没有把她牵扯进来
I hope you didn't put her up to it.

544
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,440
到时候假释小组直接给你寄驳回书
The parole board's gonna send you a flop in the mail

545
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,139
你连申辩的机会都不会有
and you won't even see them.

546
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,442
露西塔想干什么是她的事  
Lucetta does whatever the fuck she wants.

547
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:55,945
我跟你说
I told you, man.

548
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,678
她就是喜欢这些小孩子的玩意儿
She's just boisterous.

549
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,851
上帝啊  真是倒霉的一周
Jesus, what a week.

550
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,700
我想知道你对这个怎么看
Hey hey, I want to see what you think about something.

551
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,179
你看过这个吗
You ever- you seen this?

552
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,208
我在图书馆找到的
I found it in the library.

553
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,220
《音禅  上帝的声音和生命》
"Zukangor, The Sound and Life God."

554
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,880
是的  你知道它吗
Yeah, you know it?

555
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,357
不
No.

556
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,860
书里说  声音是一切的开始
They say the sound part come first.

557
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,555
他说  如果你感受到了
They say the- when you experience

558
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,065
心灵世界的真理
a spiritual truth

559
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,204
它会通过声音来到你身边
that it comes to you as a sound,

560
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,636
穿透你的身体
that it goes through you,

561
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,969
改变你的震频  让你回归和谐
changes your vibration, gets you back into harmony.

562
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,510
就像上帝的调音叉
Like God's tuning fork or something.

563
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,148
如果你身体上发生这些变化
And then if you let that happen to you,

564
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,841
你就会得到光明
then- then you get the light,

565
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,419
得到启示什么的
or you get illumination or something.

566
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,414
我没听过这些  我是主教派的
I wouldn't know about that. I'm an Episcopalian.

567
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,527
他们说  要从小事开始
They say it starts with small things,

568
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,528
比如一些小声音  小震动
like little sounds, little vibrations,

569
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,563
比如电灯的嗡嗡声
like a-just like a buzzing electric light

570
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,167
水流声  或者蜜蜂的声音
or rushing water or the sound of a bee or...

571
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,201
-是吗  -是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

572
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,895
然后就会发展
And then it grows.

573
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,201
但是这不用教父什么的  它不像宗教
But there's no priest or nothing. It's not like a religion.

574
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,492
就是一个叫阿诺德的人  
There's just this one dude named Arnold

575
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:30,744
他是创始人
who's the Zukmaster.

576
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,406
书上说  你可以自己练习
They say you do this practice all by yourself.

577
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,849
你可以听得更好
You can- you can hear better.

578
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,750
你可以通过声音听到上帝对你说话
You can hear God speaking to you through sounds.

579
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,413
什么练习
What's the practice?

580
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,787
-他们吟唱"Hue"  -Hue
- They chant "Hue. " - Hue?

581
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,089
-然后他们聆听  -听什么  蜜蜂吗
- And then they listen. - For what, a bee?

582
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,423
可能吧  我不知道
Maybe, I don't know.

583
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,195
但是  关键是
But you know, the thing is

584
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,104
他们说你会不断轮回
they say you got to keep coming back

585
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,041
直到你偿还所有的罪孽
until you pay for all your shit.

586
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,545
你会用几辈子的时间来偿还
That you've got to fix it

587
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,947
直到所有罪孽都清算干净
over a lot of lives, you know, until you work it all out.

588
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,644
好吧  那这辈子呢
Well, what about this life?

589
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,154
你这辈子做的事情呢
What about answering for

590
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,451
你该如何偿还
the things that you've done in this life?

591
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,957
见鬼  我知道我已经偿还了
Shit, I know I have.

592
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,962
是吗
Have you?

593
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,623
是的  你呢
Yeah. Have you?

594
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,408
这是耶稣的身体  赐予你
This is the body of Christ, given for you.

595
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,478
耶稣的身体  赐予你
The body of Christ, given for you.

596
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,645
耶稣的身体  赐予你
The body of Christ, given for you.

597
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,808
-我一会儿回来  -好的
- I'll be right back. - Sure.

598
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,691
给你  你开车回家
Here, you drive home.

599
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,489
我去跟牧师聊一会儿  然后自己走回去
I'm going to talk to the pastor a minute and then I'll walk.

600
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,325
好的
Okay.

601
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,333
嘿  傻子 婊子
Hey yo, foul, bitch!

602
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,130
可恶  你这个傻子
Damn, that's a hard foul!

603
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,330
这个蠢驴
Yo, that's a foul!

604
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,780
Hue
Hue...

605
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,831
伙计  你应该扣下去的
Man, you should've dunked it!

606
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,839
好的  我以前从没这样做过
Okay, I've never done this before, so-

607
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,845
我是说  我每周
well, I mean, I come to the...

608
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,313
都来教堂  我努力尝试
Church every week and I really try.

609
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,479
但是我不知道  我本来希望
And I don't know, I mean, I guess I had hoped with time

610
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,682
随着时间会越来越容易
it would be easier and easier and...

611
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,919
而且
And I'd be...

612
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,689
我的家人  身边的人
My family, people close to me,

613
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,029
对于他们似乎都很容易  但是对我
it seems to come to them easily, but for me it's...

614
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,729
我是说
I mean I've...

615
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,396
我不知道
I don't know.

616
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,073
我是说
I mean I've...

617
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,081
有时我的想法
Sometimes the thoughts that I have,

618
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,082
我的感觉...
feelings...

619
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,247
但是  有时
But, uh, sometimes

620
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,359
我只觉得你应该枪毙了我或怎样
I just think maybe you should shoot me or something.

621
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,428
我认为这不是上帝的旨意
Well, I don't believe that that's what God wants for you.

622
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,361
好吧  那他要怎么样
Well, what does he want?

623
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,799
我希望我能有个简单的答案
I wish I had a simple answer for you.

624
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,701
我不确定上帝想让你干什么
I'm not sure what God wants for you.

625
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,303
是否有...
Is there anything...

626
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,540
圣经有篇古老的短文说
There's an old Biblical passage that says...

627
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,614
"静心  吾乃上帝"
"Be still and know that I am God. "

628
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,585
也就是说
Which is a way of saying

629
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,156
有时上帝确实
sometimes God does, um,

630
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,556
会以神秘的方式向我们说话
speak to us in mysterious ways.

631
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,970
离开护栏
Off the rail!

632
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,979
我说  离开护栏
I said off the rail!

633
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,539
你好
Hello?

634
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,974
嗨  我是露西塔・科里森  我们上星期谈过
Hi, this is Lucetta Creeson. We talked last week.

635
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,444
抱歉  再说下你名字?
I'm sorry, what is your name again?

636
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,514
露西塔・科里森
Lucetta Creeson.

637
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,050
我只想问下杰克在不在家
I was just wondering if Jack was home.

638
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,779
恐怕他还在  等等  别挂
I'm afraid he's still- oh no, wait, hold on.

639
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:09,221
-杰克  电话  -是谁
- Jack, telephone.  - Who is it? Who? Who is it?

640
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,121
你的一个朋友?
A friend of yours?

641
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,293
-你好  -嘿
- Hello.  - Hey.

642
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,125
我是露西塔・科里森
It's Lucetta Creeson.

643
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,494
我只想问
Listen, I was just wondering, um,

644
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,693
我们什么时候可以见个面
when we could meet, when we could get together.

645
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,898
科里森夫人  我不知你怎么弄到我家电话的
Uh, Mrs. Creeson, I don't know how you're calling my house,

646
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,633
但我告诉过你打给办公室
but I told you to call the office.

647
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,368
我只是
Well, look, I'm just,

648
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,037
不擅长办公  而且
I'm not that great at offices and, you know,

649
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,514
在办公室我说不了真心话
I just- I just can't be real, like, in an office, you know?

650
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,550
-科里森夫人  -露西塔
- Look, Mrs. Creeson  - Lucetta.

651
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,054
科里森夫人  我在审核你丈夫的档案
Mrs. Creeson, I have business with your husband.

652
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,385
正因为这样我才打电话
Well, that's why I'm calling.

653
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,550
你觉得还有其他原因吗
I mean, what, did you think I had another reason?

654
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,321
没有  我没那样想
Well, no, I didn't.

655
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,073
或许我们可以一起午餐
Maybe we could go to lunch,

656
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:50,398
你可以带上玛布里夫人
you could bring Mrs. Mabry too.

657
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,263
她声音很甜  她的名是什么来着
You know, she's got a sweet voice. What's her first name?

658
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,062
听着  我很欣赏你如此爱你丈夫
Look, I admire that you love your husband

659
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,603
想给他帮忙
and you want to do what's right for him,

660
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,765
但我现在告诉你  你这是在帮倒忙
but you're not helping him. I'm telling you that right now.

661
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,774
听我说  杰克
Listen to me, Jack.

662
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,004
我的确爱我丈夫
I do love my husband.

663
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,943
我如此
I love my husband

664
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,381
爱我丈夫
so much.

665
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,189
我所要求的只是一个
And all I'm asking you is for a chance

666
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,121
帮助你从不同角度认识他的机会
to help you see him in a different light.

667
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,928
我是说  你工作那地方有多少人
I mean, how many men at that place you work at

668
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,464
会有这样爱他们的女人
have somebody loving them like that, huh?

669
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,197
难道这都不能让你动下恻隐之心吗
Doesn't that mean something to you,

670
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,930
你手中控制的可是他人的命运啊
a man in a position like yours?

671
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,133
这  确实  别误会我
It-it- no, it-it does, it does. Don't misunderstand me.

672
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,870
我只想要他回家
I just want him home.

673
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,482
我如此  需要他
I want... I want him so bad.

674
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,948
我要他拥抱我
I want his arms around me.

675
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,451
我要他在我床上
I want him in my bed.

676
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,954
我想念他
I miss him.

677
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,285
我不能说服你么
Can't I persuade you?

678
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,621
受伤的会是谁
Who's it gonna hurt, hmm?

679
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,061
就让我来见你吧  拜托
Just let me come see you, please.

680
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,993
让我来见你  杰克
Let me come see you, Jack.

681
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,904
我吊上他了
I got him.

682
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,978
会搞定的  宝贝
It's gonna happen, baby.

683
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,309
甜心  你没事吧
Huh. Honey, you okay?

684
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,183
我太他妈累了
I'm so fuckin' tired.

685
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,759
睡不着吗
Can't you sleep?

686
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,794
这里一直吵个不停
No, it's too loud all the time.

687
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,022
吵得我无法
So noisy I can't...

688
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,759
我无法静下心来
I can't get out of my head.

689
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,165
什么都听不到
I can't hear nothin'. I can't listen.

690
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,000
这地方开始让我头脑混乱了
This place is startin' to mess with my head.

691
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,541
跟你说  我最近在做很奇怪的梦
I'm tellin' you, I'm having these weird~ass dreams.

692
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,679
可怜
Poor honey.

693
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,885
我想自杀
I thought I wanted to kill myself, right?

694
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,222
想找个偏僻的地方把自己吊死
Thought I wanted to hang myself in the solitary.

695
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,949
我不明白  你做那种梦?
I don't get it. You dreamed that?

696
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,185
但接着我又非常害怕死掉
But then I got too scared to die

697
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,956
于是就迷茫  永无止境地待在那儿
and I just hung there for all of eternity.

698
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,861
我他妈不想待在这儿
I don't want to fuckin' be here.

699
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,702
我他妈不想待在这儿
I don't want to fuckin' be here.

700
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,904
甜心
Honey.

701
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,052
你那晚吃了什么
Honey, what'd you have to eat that night?

702
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,053
肯定是吃了什么东西  太辣了?
It must've been something. Was it spicy?

703
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,407
-投篮  -好  走吧
- Shoot it!  - All right, let's go.

704
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,207
那就是我一直和你说的我孙子
That's the grandson I've been tellin' you about right there.

705
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,683
-真可爱  -他眼睛这么
- How cute.  - His eyes are so...

706
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,787
我有个孙女
I got a grandchild.

707
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,587
你真有?
Do you really?

708
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,231
嗯  她名叫凯蒂  3岁大
Yeah. Her name's Katie, three years old.

709
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,958
-真可爱  -嗯  非常可爱
- Cute.  - Oh, yeah. Yeah, very cute.

710
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,796
她像你吗
Does she look like you?

711
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,097
好在不像我
Hell no. No no no.

712
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,262
但我想她一定爱你
I bet she loves you though.

713
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,739
-其实  -你经常见她吗
- Yeah well...  - You see her much?

714
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,278
他们住在州北部  所以不常见
They live upstate, so we don't see her that much.

715
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,110
那太糟糕了
Aw, that's too bad.

716
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:34,749
她正在办离婚  我女儿
She's getting a divorce, my daughter.

717
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,552
-抱歉  -你能怎样呢
- I'm sorry.  - What are you gonna do?

718
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,752
注定要发生的事情总会发生
People are gonna do what they're gonna do.

719
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,466
你疼痛?
Are you in pain?

720
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,999
嗯  是我的背
Yeah, it's just my back.

721
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,568
你怎么得的
Oh. What'd you get that,

722
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,432
打球还是打仗得的?
playing ball or like from some war?

723
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,096
没有  只是老年病
No no, it's just life.

724
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,799
我不知我是否能...
So I don't know if I can-

725
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,842
我不想让你空欢喜
I don't want you to get your hopes up.

726
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,479
欢喜什么
About what?

727
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,581
我对你丈夫所能做的帮助
What I can do for you, for your husband.

728
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,274
-这是一整个系统  -你试过磁疗吗
- There's a whole system  - Have you tried magnet therapy?

729
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,426
治你的背  我是说
For your back, I mean.

730
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:05,580
就是让你穿戴磁铁之类的东西
It's like these magnets that you wear and stuff.

731
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,984
-磁铁吗  -对  非常好的
- Magnets?  - Yeah, it's really good.

732
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,989
实际上  有空你应该过来坐坐
Actually, you should come over sometime,

733
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,027
有个家伙卖给我这些鞋垫
because I got these insoles this guy sold me

734
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,788
我把它们穿在鞋里后
and I wear 'em in my shoes

735
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,193
我在学校都不会觉得累
and I don't get tired in school or anything.

736
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,699
有时
And- yeah, and sometimes

737
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,497
我睡前还把它们放在枕头下
I even put 'em under my pillow before I go to sleep.

738
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,196
那样有什么用
And what does that do?

739
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,169
是这样
Well, okay,

740
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,675
你知道  我们生活的世界
you know how we're all toxic and stuff, right,

741
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,304
空中充满微波  手机辐射
with like all the microwaves and cell phones

742
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,179
和其他奇怪漂浮物  我们都中了毒
and all that weird stuff flying through the air.

743
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,820
在你的体内慢慢聚集
So it all builds up inside of you, right,

744
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,887
让你疼痛或心烦意乱
and it makes you all achy and upset-

745
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,718
还会让你得脑瘤  真的
and it can give you brain tumors, really-

746
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,382
我是说  这能让人丧命
I mean, it kills people.

747
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,120
而这些磁铁  可以帮你解毒
So these magnets, they detox you.

748
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,891
-哇  这真是  -嗯  是真的  我相信
- Wow, that's...  - Yeah, it's real. I believe it.

749
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,024
你不信吗
You don't believe it?

750
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,068
我不知道
I don't know, I guess.

751
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,035
是真的
No, it's real.

752
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,869
我很爱护身体
I mean, look, I'm all into the body, you know,

753
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,477
对我来说  身体感觉好了
and for me if the body's feeling good,

754
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,307
头脑也会清醒爽朗不少
the mind just follows, you know?

755
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,005
绝对是这样
Absolutely.

756
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,980
鸡蛋?
Egg?

757
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,211
我的孩子们做的
My kids made 'em.

758
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,377
现在都到我这了  我得全吃掉
Now I got 'em all and I have to eat 'em.

759
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,319
真不错  很漂亮
They're nice. They're pretty.

760
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,015
吃了我吧  拜托
Eat me please.

761
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,727
为何不呢
Why not?

762
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,106
我只吃有益健康的部分
I'm just eating the healthy part.

763
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:37,678
继续  全吃了
Go on, just eat the whole thing.

764
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,239
科里森  怎么了
Creeson, what's up?

765
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,381
你两天没吃东西了
You haven't been to chow in two days.

766
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,718
你得去医务室检查检查  把衣服穿上
You got a call out to go to Medical. Get dressed.

767
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,259
在那儿等等
Hold up there.

768
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,753
感觉到什么没
You feel anything?

769
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,931
没
No.

770
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:36,633
有点像刺痛的感觉
Like a tingling?

771
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:41,509
没  没什么感觉
No, I don't. I don't think I...

772
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,805
像有种拉力
Like a pull?

773
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,504
不会那么明显
It's not dramatic, you know.

774
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,015
只是某种感觉
It's just- it's kind of a sense.

775
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,952
或许有点什么吧
Yeah well, you know, maybe a little something.

776
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,851
嗯
Yeah.

777
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,056
"我遵从上帝的承诺
"To what extent is my commitment to obey God

778
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,859
有多少是基于信条与戒律
based on dos and don'ts

779
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,027
又有多少是出于对他的真爱呢"
or on a true love for Him?"

780
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,806
"在近期哪些时候我感到了上帝的指引"
"In what recent circumstance was I aware of God's leading?"

781
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,244
你来说感恩祷告吧
Why don't you say the blessing?

782
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:44,311
嗯
Yeah.

783
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,045
感谢主
Blessed O Lord...

784
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,150
感谢主
blessed O Lord,

785
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:55,855
赐予食物与您的仁爱
this food to our use, and us to Thy loving service,

786
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,935
让我们能够留意到他人的需求
and... make us mindful of the needs of others...

787
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,066
-以基督之名  阿门  - 阿门
- In Christ's name, Amen.  - Amen.

788
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,778
你失神了吗
You lose your place?

789
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,280
要鸡蛋吗
You want an egg?

790
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,998
罪恶从出生时就跟随着我们
Sin comes naturally to us from our birth.

791
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:16,940
它是自生而得的
We-we- it's inbred in us.

792
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:20,139
做了罪恶之事并不表示我们就是罪人
We are not sinners because we sin;

793
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,808
做恶事是因为我们本身就是罪人
we sin because we are sinners.

794
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,150
即使你过了完全公正的一生
Even if you lived a life of perfect righteousness,

795
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,121
你也值得入地狱  知道为什么吗
you deserve hell. You know why?

796
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,625
因为艾赛亚说  "我们所有的公正
Because "All of our righteousnesses," Isaiah says,

797
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,320
也正如肮脏的邪恶"
"Are as filthy rags. "

798
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,646
你真的很棒  杰克
You're real sweet, Jack.

799
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,749
你真的很棒很棒
You're real sweet.

800
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,422
再猛点
Fuck me harder.

801
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,299
你很棒  杰克
You're good, Jack.

802
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,129
你是个大好人  帮助我们
You're a good man for helping us,

803
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,432
我很感激
I appreciate it.

804
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,106
你要明白不能有人知道这事
You know that nobody can know about this.

805
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,946
你懂的  对吧
You know that, right?

806
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,610
任何人都不能知道
I mean nobody.

807
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,779
这非常重要
That's very important.

808
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:46,087
不管你要什么  如果有人知道就完蛋了
Whatever you want, it'll all go bad if anybody knows.

809
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,288
大家都完蛋  你明白吗
Bad for everybody, you understand that?

810
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,296
当然  傻瓜
Of course, silly.

811
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,509
怎么了  你不吃吗
What's wrong? You're not eating?

812
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,342
你是否曾想过他们所说的那些永恒的东西
You ever think about things they say go on forever?

813
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,181
什么
What?

814
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,017
他们所说的永恒的东西
Things they say go on forever- like...

815
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,953
你知道那到底是什么意思吗
What's that mean, you know?

816
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:58,192
比如说天空  他们说天空是永恒的
The sky, like, they say the sky goes on forever.

817
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,833
但它究竟是什么  它是
But what is that really? That's-

818
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:05,530
我意思是  你不会了解你看不到的东西
I mean, you can't see nothing you can't see, so...

819
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,374
天空就像在你头顶的巨大的蓝色大碗
It's like a big bowl of blue above you.

820
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,308
白天你能看到云朵
You can see clouds during the day

821
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,414
晚上或许你能看到星星
or you can see stars at night maybe,

822
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,073
但就算用望远镜  你也看不到无穷
but even with a telescope you can't see forever.

823
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,981
所以他们怎么能知道
So how do they know?

824
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,347
知道什么
Know what?

825
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,514
知道天空到底是什么
What it is.

826
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,025
永恒  他们又是怎么知道的
Eternity- how do they know?

827
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,732
那么  杰克
So- so, Jack,

828
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,707
他说委员会会复查整件事
he said the board's gonna review the whole thing, okay?

829
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,243
他们会考虑
And they're going to take into consideration

830
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,610
你的年龄和
your age and, you know,

831
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,684
你妈  所有的因素
your mom and all that,

832
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:54,584
还有那时你曾是瘾君子的事实
and the fact that you were an addict back then, um...

833
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,954
-石头宝贝  -嗯?
- Hey, Stoney baby?  - Hmm?

834
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,255
看着我
Look at me.

835
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,301
我在告诉你假释的事
Well, I was trying to tell you about your parole.

836
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:09,403
嗯
Yeah?

837
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,267
你没有在听
Well, you weren't listening.

838
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,970
我在听着的
Oh yeah, I'm listening.

839
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,707
我有在听
I am.

840
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:25,115
好  杰克说
Okay, so Jack said, um-

841
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,084
你叫他杰克?
You call him Jack?

842
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:28,780
当然
Sure.

843
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,623
很好  他说了什么
That's good. What's he say?

844
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,962
他会和你谈
Okay, so, um, he's gonna talk to you

845
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,658
他会重新审核你的档案
and he's going over the whole thing

846
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,115
几天之内他就会总结
and he's gonna decide in a

847
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,499
对你这案件的意见
few days to write up his notes in your case file

848
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,704
然后递交给假释委员会
to submit it to the parole

849
00:57:45,705 --> 00:57:47,471
他们下星期重审的时候
commission so when they go over it next week

850
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,628
就可以看到他的总结
they're gonna see it.

851
00:57:48,629 --> 00:57:49,736
这难道不棒吗  宝贝
Isn't that great, baby?

852
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,972
甜心  就要成功了  这难道不棒吗
Honey, this could be it. Isn't that great?

853
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,517
嗯
Yeah.

854
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,159
我做得还不够好吗
Didn't-didn't-didn't I do good?

855
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,794
看着我
Well, look at me.

856
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,504
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

857
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,768
有时我觉得  最好的事
Sometimes I think the best thing is...

858
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,872
就是聆听
Is just-just listen.

859
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,956
别装了行吗
Would you stop playin'?

860
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,622
你认为天国是个安宁的国度吗
Is the kingdom of heaven you think it should be a peaceful kingdom

861
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,029
我们会和谐相处吗
And we should all get along?

862
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,525
如果是那样最好  但这也可能是为了把
That's great, but is it just going

863
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,846
天国搬到地球这个同样是主创造的世界
to be a constant struggle...

864
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:47,124
而做的无休无止的斗争
...to have the kingdom of heaven here on earth, one of his creation?

865
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:44,962
的确是个难以定夺
That's a tough one.

866
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,875
打开53
Crack 53!

867
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,817
只要告诉我是30还是31号就行
Just tell me, is it the 30th or the 31st?

868
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,387
我受够你了
I've had about enough lip from you!

869
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,921
妈的  告诉我是哪天就好
God damn it, just tell me, which one is it?

870
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,559
把你姿态收起来  客气点  我说真的
You can button that up right now and be nice. And I mean it.

871
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,502
科里森到了
Creeson's here.

872
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,070
如何叫一个人
How do ask a person to...

873
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,730
把他自身经历过的东西
To explain something that-

874
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,104
解释给另一个
that they experienced

875
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:30,939
无法体验到
to where another person's got no way

876
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,674
这种不定性经历的人
to relate to the whole indefiniteness of it, you know?

877
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,281
你已经不信我了  是吗
You don't believe me already, do you?

878
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,547
我不是不信你  我只是
I'm not saying I don't believe you. I just, you know, I-

879
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,417
我看过带子  确实很让人吃惊
look, I've seen the tape, it's quite a thing.

880
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,092
但你并没有怎么样
But nothing happened to you.

881
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:46,254
我是说  你并未身在其中
I mean, you weren't involved in any way.

882
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,920
没错  我不知道如何去...
Yeah, look, I don't know how to even-

883
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:54,229
我不是...
I'm not-

884
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,428
我不知道  我...
I don't know. I-

885
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,630
你经历了  一个深奥的
You had, what, a profound

886
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,969
精神圣灵体验
spiritual epiphany.

887
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,703
妈的  我以前甚至从未听过那词
Shit, man, I ain't never even heard that word before.

888
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,371
我们不必非要谈这个
Look, we don't have to talk about it.

889
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,642
真的无关紧要
You know, it really don't matter.

890
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,786
那么...
Well...

891
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,221
别误会我
I mean, don't get me wrong,

892
01:00:13,222 --> 01:00:15,116
我想相信这类事  但...
I'd like to believe in such things, but-

893
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,053
例如什么  你难道相信我吗
Like what? Like me? You believe in me?

894
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:18,788
当然  我也想信你
Sure, I'd like to believe in you too.

895
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,491
所以我们才会坐到这  是吧
I mean that's why we're all here, right?

896
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,296
哇
Wow.

897
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:32,164
好  等等  好好听着
Okay, you know, wait, look,

898
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,275
当时那就好像
there were something like...

899
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,070
一瞬间
It was just a moment.

900
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:42,815
干扰  全消失了
The static, it just all went away, you know?

901
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,316
我真能听见
And I could really hear,

902
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,977
就好像我真的能清晰听见
like I could hear clear, for real.

903
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:51,024
我也不清楚  它让我从不同角度看待事物
I don't know. It just made me see everything different.

904
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,492
它让我以不同方式看待自己的人生
It made me look at my life in a different way.

905
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,154
突然间  我能看到
It was just all of a sudden I could- I could see that

906
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,816
我在这儿的生活并不像我之前认为的那样
my life in here isn't empty

907
01:00:58,817 --> 01:01:01,200
空洞  毫无意义
and pointless like I thought it was before.

908
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,461
家庭和...
Family and...

909
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,540
-石头  别玩了  -别玩什么
- Look, Stone, just drop it. - Drop what?

910
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,305
我知道你想干什么  但别干了
Well, I know what you're trying to do, but don't.

911
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,508
别干了  那没用的  停下吧
Just-just-just don't. It's not helping. Just stop.

912
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,846
嘿  听着
Hey look, man,

913
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,512
这对我不再重要了
it don't matter to me no more.

914
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,124
-什么不重要了  -我不在乎
- What doesn't matter?  - I don't care about what-

915
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:27,387
你所做的或其他人想让你做的
what you're doin' or what anybody else is tryin' to make you do.

916
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,633
让我做吗  什么意思  
Make me do? What's that?

917
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:31,021
没人想让我做什么
Nobody's trying to make me do anything.

918
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,533
好
Okay.

919
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:40,074
你应做你认为正确之事  好吧
You should do what you think is right, okay?

920
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,177
你说我怎样就怎样  就写你的真实感受
I am whatever you say I am in there, so write what you feel.

921
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,644
我说真的  怎么想的就怎么写
Seriously. I mean it. I mean, judge me how you think.

922
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,840
-好吧  -我是说  别误会我的意思
- Well... - I mean, don't get me wrong,

923
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,882
我是想出去
I want to be out,

924
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,885
但是如果我出去了还会像以前那样混日子
but I'm gonna wrestle with the same shit if I'm out.

925
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,718
反而我要是不出去就能保持这样的感觉
And I'm gonna keep this feeling if I'm in.

926
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,821
那你现在改过自新了吗
So you're all good now?

927
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,933
不是  我不是说我突然一下高兴了
No, no, no. Look, I ain't sayin' I'm all happy all of a sudden.

928
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,433
你知道  一直以来我都很嚣张
You know, my middle finger's been up a long time, man.

929
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:11,573
我不会突然之间跟人招手微笑
I'm not just gonna start wavin' and smilin' at people.

930
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,732
我还是会发火  我还是会发脾气
I'm gonna pop off. I'm gonna lose my temper, and-

931
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,072
而且会说一些做一些让我后悔的事
and say shit and do shit that I'm gonna regret, whatever.

932
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:21,079
我只是  我就是我  你明白吗
I just- I just- I am who I am, you know?

933
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,412
那些都没什么  你明白我的意思吗
And that's okay. You know what I'm sayin'?

934
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,952
不  我想我不明白
No. No, I'm afraid I don't.

935
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,784
好吧  我说过我解释不清楚的
Well, I told you I couldn't explain it really.

936
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,051
-你没事吧  -后背不太舒服
- Are you okay? - Yeah. My back.

937
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,957
我去别的房间睡
I'm gonna go sleep in the other room.

938
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,598
你能在那里找到慰藉
You can take great comfort in that,

939
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,529
但那种慰藉并不是真的
but that can be a false comfort.

940
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,602
有时候在文明的曙光中
Sometimes in the twilight of a civilization,

941
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,035
伟大的文化会繁荣昌盛起来
there can be a great cultural flowering,

942
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:48,699
但事实上  那样的社会根基里存在着裂缝
but in reality, there are cracks in the foundation of that society

943
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,310
所以那样的社会注定在劫难逃
and that society is doomed.

944
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,333
如果你真的想知道...
If you really want to know,

945
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:17,961
我觉得那只是演戏什么的
I think it's some kind of play-acting or something.

946
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,766
那都是胡扯
It's all bullshit?

947
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:24,139
不  不  石头只是
No. No. Look, Stoney's just...

948
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,110
你知道的  他脑子有点混乱
You know. I mean, he's screwed up.

949
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,647
他对事物的看法很怪异
He's got weird ideas about things.

950
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,479
有时候真的很怪异
Sometimes really weird.

951
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,622
但是  他一直就那样
But, I mean, he's always been that way.

952
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:38,487
跟他谈话后
Talkin' to him,

953
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,525
我觉得他...
he almost seemed like...

954
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,664
他怎么了
Like what?

955
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,266
有点  我也说不清  不一样了
Something- really, I don't know. Different.

956
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:49,370
不会吧
No.

957
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:53,497
他只是想给你留下个好印象
Look, he-'s just trying to impress you, you know,

958
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,166
为了出来他什么都肯做
trying to do whatever it takes to get out.

959
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,335
你能因为这个责怪他吗
Can you blame him?

960
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,777
-不  别了  -怎么了
- No, it's okay. - What?

961
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,715
坐下来吧
Hey, sit down.

962
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,547
过来  过来坐下
Come on. Come on, sit down.

963
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,383
坐下
Sit down.

964
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,819
他很敬仰你
Look, he admires you a lot, you know.

965
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,727
他跟我说和你谈话学到了很多东西
He told me he learned a lot talking to you.

966
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,963
你能跟说实话吗
Can you be straight?

967
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:27,039
一直都在说实话呢
Straight as you.

968
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,867
所有这一切都只是...
Is this all just a- I mean,

969
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,707
告诉我到底怎么回事
just-just-just tell me what's going on.

970
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,879
我不会去做任何我不想做的事
I don't do anything I don't want to do.

971
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,214
我喜欢你
I like you.

972
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,519
我喜欢你  杰克
I like you, Jack.

973
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,326
如果我不愿意我是不
