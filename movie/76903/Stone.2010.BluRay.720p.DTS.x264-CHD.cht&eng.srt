1
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,834
剛那是非常短的一桿推桿
It was a very short putt.

2
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,192
鑒于之前一洞已多于標準桿一桿
It would seem routine had

3
00:00:32,193 --> 00:00:34,343
這一桿反而顯得有些劍走偏鋒
he not just come off a bogey the hole before.

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,744
失誤在先顯然令他有些沮喪
Mm-hmm, obviously smarting from that.

5
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,886
不過我們來看看這一桿他怎么處理
But let's see what he does here.

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,988
教科書般完美無缺  完美無缺
Oh perfect. Textbook, textbook.

7
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,182
現在去看看第七球道上李·特拉維諾的情況
We move ahead now to Lee Trevino on the fairway at the seventh.

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,726
從他的桿底角看  似乎下方草皮有斷片
His lie looks as though he may be in a little divot.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,388
顯然如此  巡回賽官員正在嚴加斥責
Absolutely. Tournament officials have been cracking down

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,398
負責填補的球童
on caddies filling in the divots.

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,657
在這樣高水平的比賽中
At this level of the game,

12
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,561
高爾夫的規范制度也愈加彰顯
some of us gotta watch the etiquette of golf.

13
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,949
睡吧
Just go to sleep.

14
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,775
漂亮的近距切球
A lovely approach.

15
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,078
他在斟酌  我想這般優秀...
He's considering it now. I presume that a player like...

16
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,346
沙桿還是中號劈起桿
Sand wedge or intermediate pitching wedge.

17
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,109
真讓人激動  他正在瞄準
Oh, very exciting. He's lining up the shot.

18
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,287
看著我
Look at me.

19
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,423
什么
Hmm?

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,121
我受不了了
I'm not standing for this.

21
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,266
什么
Sorry?

22
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,363
你禁錮了我的靈魂
You keep my soul in a dungeon.

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,830
我要離開你
I'm leaving.

24
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,012
杰克
Jack?

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,329
-杰克  -你走我就把她扔下去
- Jack. - If you leave me, I'll throw her.

26
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,966
你覺得我不敢是嗎
You think that I won't, hmm?

27
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,335
-求你了  -你覺得我不敢是嗎
- Please. - Do you think I won't?!

28
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,799
我不走  不離開你
I won't leave. I won't leave you.

29
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,756
對不起  別再那樣做
I'm sorry. Don't ever do that again.

30
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,557
別離開我  別再那樣做
Don't ever leave me. Don't ever do that again.

31
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,009
光明美麗遍大地
All things bright and beautiful.

32
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:02,381
浩瀚渺小皆蒼生
All creatures great and small.

33
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,422
聰慧美好滿人間
All things wise and wonderful.

34
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,359
上主慈悲萬物生
The Lord God made them all.

35
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,555
請各位就座
I invite you to be seated at this time.

36
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,200
非常漂亮的補桿
Oh, that's a very nice touch.

37
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,639
那或許他可以保住標準桿
So maybe he can make a par. And at worse from there

38
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,437
之后再糟糕應該也能保住總桿數標準桿
you'd think he could stay his point total.

39
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,377
他現在卻在這個標準三桿的洞使用七號鐵桿
Now here we find him with a 7-iron at this par-3 hole.

40
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:31,377
鐵桿：用金屬做的桿，用作中距離的擊球
桿號越小，球擊得越遠

41
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,270
我不知道是不是他右腳打滑的原因
I don't know if there was a problem with him slippin' with

42
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,258
但那絕對應該是個左旋球
his right foot there, but definitely a pull.

43
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,120
顯然他心中早有打算
He obviously had the thought in his head

44
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,955
想要出其不意
that he needed to give it a little bit extra,

45
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,427
如今卻陷入困境
and he's found himself in a difficult spot.

46
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,658
他對這場比賽的全部期望...
All the expectations he had coming into this,

47
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,939
-喂  -杰克
- Hello? - Jack.

48
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,807
貝西
Betsy.

49
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,607
你哥哥去世了
Your brother slipped away.

50
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,320
終于脫離苦海了
Finally out of his misery.

51
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,683
-是的  -我懂  我懂
- Yes, he is. - Oh, I know, I know.

52
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,135
我一次次聽到這樣的話語
And how many times did I hear,

53
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:14,985
"你為什么不能像你哥哥鮑比那樣"
"Why can't you be like your brother Bobby"?

54
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,527
要是每聽一次這句話我就有一毛錢進帳
If I had a nickel for every time that was said to me...

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,626
想必我也發達了
I'd be a rich man today.

56
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,168
對于他前額上的那一塊傷疤
That scar on his forehead that he had,

57
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,205
他總能講出一個淵源
he always had a story for it,

58
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,415
但其實罪魁禍首是我
but it was me.

59
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,673
我八歲時砸了這位完美先生一錘頭
I threw a hammer at Mr. Perfect when I was eight.

60
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,042
但為了庇護他愛的人  他絕口不提  
He never told though. He covered for the people he loved.

61
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,515
我愛著這樣的他  他就是這樣一個人
That's how he was and I loved him for that.

62
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,154
我希望能像他一樣
And I wanted to be like him.

63
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,051
方方面面
Everything-

64
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,362
我只想說...
I just want to say that...

65
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,172
若不是鮑比  我...
If it wasn't for Bobby, I'd...

66
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,005
我不知道...
I- I don't know...

67
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,514
自己會是何種境地
Where I would've wound up.

68
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,213
他教會我生活  明辨是非
He taught me how to live, what was right.

69
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,182
我會懷念他
I'm gonna miss him.

70
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,592
他一生無憾  一生無憾  他...
He lived right. He lived right. He was...

71
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:30,565
人生至此  夫復何求
What more could you s- want people to say about you?

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,671
圣經通篇描述上帝如何公正
All throughout Scripture it talks about God being a just God.

73
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,946
可我剛讀了一個寓言  
I mean, I just read the parable

74
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,677
講述了一個女人不停地前來訴說
about the unjust judge,

75
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,749
其中的決斷就有失公允
where the woman kept coming and coming and saying...

76
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,079
關懷  愛意  寬容
Caring, loving, forgiving...

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,915
我懷疑你是否真心贊同那些言論
I'm wondering if you concur with what you've heard so far?

78
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,956
我認為關于選擇  關于自由意志...
I think that the choices, the idea of free will,

79
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,060
以及我們有選擇的自由...
and the fact that we have freedom of choice...

80
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,101
如今我們生活的時代
The reality of the times we live in,

81
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,190
充斥著焦躁和不安
this notion that- this angst

82
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,743
片名:  《色獄心機》

83
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,736
舉國上下多少人內心波瀾起伏
that a lot of people are feeling in this country,

84
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,145
憂心于我們經歷了某種根本性轉變
that we've gone through some sort of fundamental transformation...

85
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,927
今日早些時候
"Barack Obama earlier today,

86
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,222
巴拉克·奧巴馬將其五個月前
crediting his so-called stimulus package

87
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,618
簽署的所謂刺激計劃標榜為
that he signed four or five months ago,

88
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,784
"把現金送進納稅人的口袋"
as "Putting cash into the pockets of taxpayers. "

89
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,954
如果作為底特律地區的納稅人的您
If you're a taxpayer in the Detroit area

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,565
拿到了刺激計劃送來的現金
who got cash in your pocket from the stimulus plan,

91
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,545
請打電話給我
I'd love to hear from ya,

92
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:37,963
當然您也可以通過網絡聯系我們
and you can also check in via the internet,

93
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,967
但我們期待聽到您的親口描述
but we would love to hear from you personally.

94
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,346
沃倫市的凱文  接通凱文
Kevin in Warren. We go to Kevin.

95
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:42,606
凱文  感謝來電
Kevin thanks so much for calling.

96
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,070
非常榮幸
Welcome.

97
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,078
你好  帕姆
Hi, Pam.

98
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,021
謝謝
Thanks.

99
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,157
不  是真的
No, it's true.

100
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,058
上帝作證  我改過自新了
With God is my witness, I've changed.

101
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,495
以耶穌和家人的名義...
With Jesus and my family...

102
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,857
主啊  以前的事我很后悔
Oh my God, I'm sorry for what I've done.

103
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,892
搞了把玩具槍把酒品店給搶了
I mean, I robbed a goddamn liquor store with a toy gun.

104
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,054
哪個傻帽干這種蠢事啊
What kinda- what kinda idiot does that?

105
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,783
監獄長找你
Warden wants to see you.

106
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,556
你好  艾利
Hi, Allie.

107
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,859
-你好  米曲  杰尼斯  -杰克
- Hi, Mitch. Janice. - Jack.

108
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,264
-什么事  -關門  杰克
- What's up? - Shut the door, Jack.

109
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,239
這個叫迪肖恩·麥克尼的
This Deshawn Mackey guy.

110
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,347
由你負責  這是你的報告  對吧
This is yours? Your report, right?

111
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,120
對  怎么了
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

112
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,812
簡直一團糟  杰克
It's an incompetent mess, Jack.

113
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,788
我知道你的心早就飛到高爾夫球場上了
I mean, look, I know your head's already out on the golf course,

114
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,157
但這份報告簡直是有辱斯文
but this is a travesty of proper casework here.

115
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,262
-騙到你了  -確實
- I got ya. - You got me.

116
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,309
給  跟言簡意賅的大師學學
Here. Learn from the master of understatement.

117
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,946
-一定  -要簡潔
- Absolutely. - Keep 'em brief.

118
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,411
得趁你走人之前
Now I need to get Janice

119
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,811
讓杰尼斯熟悉起來
up to speed before you're out the back door,

120
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,352
所以就把你手上未定的審核都交給她吧
so let's pass all your indeterminates eligible off to her.

121
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,753
好的  當然  但我手頭已經審核的案子
Yeah yeah, of course, but I'd like to stay on my currents,

122
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,985
我想堅持做完他們的復查階段  可以嗎
if I can see them through to review- is that okay?

123
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,761
當然  只要你愿意
Yeah, if you're willing.

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,365
-我很愿意  謝謝  -好的
- I would like to. Thank you. - Yeah.

125
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,968
-沒事了  -好
- We're good. - Okay.

126
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,196
節哀順變
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

127
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,965
什么
Excuse me?

128
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,370
你哥哥  我才聽說  請節哀順變
Your brother- I just recently heard, I'm sorry.

129
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,307
多謝關心
Thank you.

130
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,145
-好的  -好
- Okay. - Yeah.

131
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,048
石頭
S- Stone.

132
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,153
什么
Hmm?

133
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,050
不是  我叫石頭
No, I-I'm Stone.

134
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,215
我知道文件里寫的"杰拉德"
I mean, I know it say "Gerald" In the file,

135
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,328
但我更喜歡石頭這個名號
but I'm just saying I prefer Stone.

136
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,732
杰拉德·科里森
Gerald Creeson.

137
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,397
石頭算怎么回事  外號嗎
So what's Stone, like a nickname?

138
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,227
是監獄里的外號嗎
That's something from here?

139
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,096
不  不是  老兄  讓那幫屌人去死
No. Oh no, man. Fuck ail these assholes.

140
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,569
那些認得我的人才這么叫我
Yo, that's what my people call me. You know, people who know me.

141
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,007
我們不會就這樣
Look, are we just gonna,

142
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,070
拿張表勾勾叉叉吧?
like- are you just gonna tick the boxes and shit?

143
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,681
就不能有話直說嗎
I mean, can we- can we talk straight?

144
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,481
你到底幫不幫我出去
I mean, you gonna help me out or what?

145
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,909
你懂不懂  我覺得
'Cause I, you know, I don't think

146
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,131
這破牢我已經蹲夠本兒了
I deserve to be up in here no more.

147
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,247
說慢點  慢點  慢點
Let's just slow down. Slow slow down.

148
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,719
我磨了夠久了  再來三年也不能...
I've done a long bid, man. Three more years ain't gonna-

149
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,757
說慢點  來談談你為什么來蹲牢吧
Slow down. Let's - let's talk about what got you here.

150
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,809
來講講吧
You want to tell me about that?

151
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,758
不就在你面前嗎
It's right there in front of you.

152
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,422
干嘛還要說一遍
Why you want to talk about that again?

153
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,363
因為現在你攥在我手里
'Cause now you're mine.

154
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,260
你進入下一級審核了
You moved up.

155
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,423
還有  我就是喜歡聊天
And just 'cause I like to chat.

156
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,673
里面那幫二逼
All these scrubs in here,

157
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,537
那幫短刑期的  還有那些軟柿子
you know, these short-timers and meatballs,

158
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,900
都裝出一副被冤枉的樣子  對不對
they're like, they're all innocent, right?

159
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,702
至少我承認了
Yeah. But at least I admit it.

160
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,708
我當時就承認了自己的罪過
You know, I copped to what I did right away,

161
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,143
現在該往前看了  老兄
and-and now I'm lookin' forward, man.

162
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,283
我外面有工作等著  我就不明白了
I got a job lined up and I'm sayin',

163
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,544
這種屁話要說多少遍才算個頭
why I got to talk about that shit every fuckin' time?

164
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,449
因為我想聽你自己說出來  沒其他原因
'Cause I want to hear your side of it, that's why.

165
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,453
猜怎么著  操他媽的狗屁事  操你媽
You know what? Just fuck this shit. Fuck you too.

166
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,888
-我他媽沒空陪你玩  -小子
- I ain't got time for this bullshit. - Hey, son-

167
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,426
你丫壓根就沒想讓我通過
No, you're just settin' them up so they can flop me, man.

168
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,655
你愛寫什么隨便寫  不同意就不同意吧
So you write what you're gonna write and let's just get on with it, man.

169
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,765
-哥無所謂  -小子  石頭
- 'Cause I'll take the flop. - Hey, son. Stone.

170
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,298
-你寫啊  寫不同意啊  寫啊  -小子  別激動
- Go ahead, max me, max me. - Son, calm down.

171
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,402
你以為我怕你啊  隨你他媽怎么寫
You don't think I'll do it, I'll see that max standing

172
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,662
-哥才不怕你  -石頭
- on my fucking head, man. - Stone!

173
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,464
出去以后有你好看  賤人
I'll see you outside before you see me, bitch.

174
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,774
石頭  兩秒以后  
Stone!

175
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,425
你他媽就會回牢里蹲著
In about two fucking seconds you're gonna go in the hole,

176
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,575
而你的檔案也會被壓在最底下
and your file is gonna go to the bottom of my pile.

177
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,476
明白嗎  看見面前那扇門沒
You understand? You see that door in front of you?

178
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,947
你知道出門意味著什么  回監獄
You know where it goes- back.

179
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,017
你想重回監獄  隨便你
You want to go back? Be my guest.

180
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,655
想開始新生活  想出去看新世界
You want to go forward, you want to walk out of here,

181
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,189
想找到那扇門嗎  我  我就是那扇門
you want to find that door? Me, I'm that door.

182
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,513
你得通過我
And you will go through me.

183
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,328
哪怕我問起天氣
If I ask you a question about the weather,

184
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,532
你他媽也得乖乖回答
you better fucking answer it

185
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,464
否則咱們三年后再見
or go back and I'll see you in three years.

186
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,997
-明白沒  -明白
- You got it? - Yeah.

187
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,761
-那你他媽就坐下  -好
- Then sit the fuck down. - All right.

188
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,303
都沒事了
Well, we just shootin' the shit.

189
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,511
我喜歡她  夠勁兒
I like her, man. She's hard.

190
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,318
好  行了  聽我說
Okay. All right, look,

191
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,685
程序就是這樣
look, this is a process.

192
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,849
我們聊聊
We talk.

193
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,553
我們不是朋友  那就裝成朋友  好嗎
We're not friends, but just pretend we're friends, okay?

194
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,858
放松  隨便聊聊  就這樣
Relax, just-just talk, that's all,

195
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,524
說不定咱們就能各得其所  好嗎
and then maybe we both get what we want, okay?

196
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,035
-行  那就裝吧  -好
- Okay, let's pretend. - Okay.

197
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,867
你結婚了
You're married.

198
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,031
對
Yeah.

199
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,836
那很好
Okay, that's good.

200
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,376
你結婚多久了
How long are you married?

201
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,572
九年了  八年就在這兒耗了
Nine years, man- eight of it up in this shit.

202
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,514
材料里寫過了  老兄  我不想...
It's right in the file, man. I don't want-

203
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,355
說說你的妻子
Let's talk about your wife.

204
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,752
-露西塔  -對
- Lucetta? - Mm-hmm, yeah.

205
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,824
-她來過這里沒  你見過她沒  -沒有
- Has she come up here? You seen her? - No.

206
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,656
-她正點到爆  兄弟  -什么意思
- She's a dime, dawg. - What's a dime?

207
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,820
完美情人  她很好
Perfect 10, man. She's fine.

208
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,400
我偷偷跟你說
I'll tell you, between you and me,

209
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,400
她很不同一般
she's-she's a alien.

210
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,232
不同一般  她是外國來的非法移民嗎
Alien? What do you mean, like an illegal?

211
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,069
不  不是非法移民  她比你還白呢
No, she ain't illegal, man. She's whiter than you.

212
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,336
她就像是  就像是
No, she's like- she's like a-

213
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,912
從另一個世界來的
she's an alien from another world, man.

214
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,884
她常來看你嗎  周六給你帶便當嗎
She visit you much? Picnics most Saturdays?

215
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,114
我討厭便當  我喜歡干她
I don't want no picnic, man. I miss my dick in her fuckin' ass.

216
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,589
我無比懷念口交時那種欲仙欲死的感覺
You know, I miss her suckin' me till I can't take no more.

217
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,524
她瘋的很  什么都肯做
I mean, she's crazy. She'll do anything.

218
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,977
乳交  顏射都無所謂
Fuck her tits, come in her face,

219
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,756
她也就眨眨眼  笑個不停
she'll just blink and keep on laughing, man.

220
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,366
她就是...
It's- she-

221
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,949
你要真想聊露西塔
look, if we gonna talk about Lucetta,

222
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,764
可得做好心理準備
you better watch out,

223
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,598
接下來給你描述的事兒
'cause I'm gonna give you some pictures in your head

224
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,740
估計要讓你性奮得好幾夜睡不著了
gonna keep you up nights, man.

225
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,143
不會吧
Oh man.

226
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,443
對不起  對不起  我說話漏風  我知道
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I- I got a mouth, I know.

227
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,609
我的錯  老兄  你現在看我那眼神 
I apologize, man. You're givin' me that look,

228
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,484
感覺就像是審核到此為止了
and I feel like you go down here and that's the end of this shit.

229
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,626
這樣  我可不想惹你
Look, I don't want no beef with you.

230
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,658
我好好待著
I just want to be vegetarian.

231
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,468
那是你老婆嗎
Is that your wife? You're married?

232
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,334
對
Yeah.

233
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,338
-很久了嗎  -四十三年了
- A long time? - 43 years.

234
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,670
不會吧
Get the fuck out.

235
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,313
看來是真愛了
Man, that's true love, huh?

236
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,293
真好  四十三年了
That's great, and after 43 years

237
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,313
還有激情干柴烈火什么的
and you still get it on and everything?

238
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,817
-你說什么  -不是  我是真好奇
- Excuse me? - No, I'm really curious about this.

239
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,818
是這樣  我愛我的馬子
It's like, say, I love my lady, right,

240
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,423
但有時候想想
but, you know, I wonder sometimes,

241
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,084
要是她以后滿身滿臉的褶子可怎么辦
like how you gonna do when the skin starts to go to the crepe,

242
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,866
你明白我意思嗎
you know what I'm sayin'? I mean,

243
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,629
你一般怎么搞
what do- how does that work for you?

244
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,428
要吃點偉哥硬起來還是怎樣
Like you get hip to Viagra, so you can like hammer nails with it?

245
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,220
等等  你聽好
Listen listen, look, I don't

246
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,664
我不跟人這樣討論我老婆
talk with anybody about my wife like that.

247
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,672
我沒說你老婆  我在說我自己
I ain't talkin' about your wife. I'm sayin', for me,

248
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,674
我關在這里很多年了
you know, I've been locked up a long time.

249
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,817
現在讓我去干
You don't need much more

250
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,541
估計沒兩下就不行了
than two pumps and a swirl to get it done.

251
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,148
嘴巴干凈點
I don't consider this polite conversation.

252
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,116
我沒想顯粗魯  我只想知道
I ain't tryin' to be rude, okay? I really want to know

253
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,277
你能量釋放到哪里
where does that go?

254
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,890
或者說發泄到哪里
Or where do you put it, if you-

255
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,719
你懂我的意思不
you get what I'm sayin'?

256
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,328
我想知道你怎么處理這事
I want to know how it works for you,

257
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,054
怎么把那把火壓住
how you keep a lid on that.

258
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,393
現在不是談我的時候
We're not- we're not talking about me.

259
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,366
不談我  懂不懂
We're not talking about me, okay?

260
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,329
人類看表象
Man looks on the outward appearance.

261
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,736
上帝看心靈
God looks on the heart.

262
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,242
當然人的心靈確實很重要
And certainly the heart of a man does matter,

263
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,710
因為口中所言皆由心生
because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks...

264
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,700
選擇是上帝決意呈現給我們的
Only in the choices that God decides to present to us.

265
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,236
不對  我不是那意思
Well, no, I'm not saying that.

266
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,740
我是說我相信人是有主觀能動性的
I'm saying that I just believe that we're automatons...

267
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,532
事情就是這樣
...and here's the deal:

268
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,370
-我沒有選擇出生  -很嚴肅的
- I did not choose to be born... - This is very very serious.

269
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,706
我也無法選擇再出生一次
...and I cannot choose to be born again.

270
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,109
她都四歲了  你相信嗎
She's four- can you believe it?

271
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,808
諸如此類的事情上我沒有選擇權
I had no choice in that matter whatsoever, and yet

272
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,284
-卻有很多人...  -你去哪兒了
- there are so many people that... - Where have you gone?

273
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,286
認為他們在靈魂再生
...think they have a choice in the matter

274
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,949
和靈魂形成上可以選擇
of their spiritual rebirth and their spiritual formation.

275
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,681
事實上
The fact of the matter is,

276
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,393
生命種子埋下  受孕完成
a seed is planted and conception takes place,

277
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,760
-而你只能順應天命  -阿門
- which you had nothing to do with. - Amen.

278
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,129
上帝之聲  WDDL廣播電臺
All Voices Under God, WDDL,

279
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,829
幾條重要消息后再回來
will continue here right after these very important messages.

280
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,644
當時我們嗑嗨了  想找錢
Look, we was high as shit and we were lookin' for money.

281
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,676
爺爺聽到我們的聲音
You know? My poppy hears us.

282
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,314
他和迪奇說了幾句
Him and Teach have words.

283
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,972
爺爺去別處拿了槍
Poppy goes and gets his gun.

284
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,175
我就想"搞毛  我可不想攙和進來"
And I was like, "Fuck this. I don't want no part of this,"

285
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,978
于是我就出去了
and I went outside.

286
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,022
然后迪奇把事情處理了  房子也燒了
So then, Teach done what he done and then the house got burnt.

287
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,860
實在是...糟透了
It was- you know, it was terrible.

288
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,860
我當時就知道自己犯了大錯
I was like a terrible mistake that I made.

289
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,499
悲慘極了但也已經過去很久了
I was tragic and it was a long time ago

290
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,135
我為此付出了...
and I've paid- I've paid...

291
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,634
太長時間的煎熬
With a lot of hard time.

292
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,797
我想現在我準備好出去了
And I just think, you know, I'm so ready to be out

293
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,000
開始新生活
and start my life again,

294
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,441
所以...
and well, so what-

295
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,877
我們要怎怎怎么做才能實現
you know, what-what-what can we do to make that happen?

296
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,482
怎樣你才會幫我實現
How can you help me make that happen?

297
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,982
看情況吧
Well, we'll see.

298
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,485
這才剛開始  所以
We were just getting started, so-

299
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,817
我來這里變好了不少  你知道嗎
A lot of good things have happened for me in here, you know.

300
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,687
我考了GED[相當于高中水平]
I did my GED like that, man.

301
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,885
我在紡織工廠里改造
I held down this job- Textiles Unit,

302
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,826
過去的兩年一直是第一名
number one position the last two years.

303
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,400
我要回家找我的妻子
I'm goin' home to my wife.

304
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,557
她都給我找好工作了
She's got a spot for me, you know,

305
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,506
在埃勒特山的克萊斯勒汽車廠
Mount Elliot Chrysler,

306
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:52,007
工作都準備好了
job lined up.

307
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,506
我想去  你知道嗎  
I'm-I'm going, you know.

308
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:54,834
是的  這是誰的主意
Yeah, whose idea was it?

309
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,879
露西塔  她認識
Lucetta- she knows

310
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,133
埃勒特山分店的經理
the branch manager at Mount Elliot.

311
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,673
不  不是你的工作
No no, not your job.

312
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,209
要去你祖父母家是誰的主意
Whose idea was it to go to your grandparent's?

313
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,903
-什么  -是誰的主意
- What? - Whose idea was it?

314
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,043
我告訴過你  我告訴過你  是迪奇
I told you- I told you it was Teach.

315
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,745
迪奇  你知道
Teach, you know.

316
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,391
就像我說的  我甚至沒有...
Like I said, I wasn't even...

317
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,754
我一直就在屋子外面
I was...I went outside the house.

318
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,055
是的  但是你沒有阻止他們  對吧
Yeah, but you didn't stop them, did you?

319
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,824
-阻止他們什么  -殺害你的祖父母
- Stop 'em what? - From killing your grandparents.

320
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:28,001
你根本不想讓我通過是吧  哥們
You-you-you ain't gonna do it, man.

321
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,534
你不會...
You're not gonna-

322
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,406
你知道個屁啊  見鬼
You don't give a fuck, man. Shit.

323
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,116
我當時在外面
I was outside,

324
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,447
迪奇出來了
Teach...Teach come out,

325
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,023
直到他告訴我  我才知道他做了什么
and I didn't even know what he'd done until he told me.

326
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,592
迪奇都已經作證了  哥們
Teach testified to that, man.

327
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,222
這就是為什么我沒有被判謀殺罪
He- that's why I didn't even catch the rap for...for manslaughter.

328
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,628
而只是幫兇和縱火罪
I got accessory and arson.

329
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,293
我已經蹲了八年了
I've done eight out of 10-15.

330
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,601
你們到底想讓我怎么樣
I mean, what...what more do you want from me?

331
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,546
好吧  這樣
Okay, so,

332
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,648
我們要讓今天
let's make today

333
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,284
成為又一個異常特殊的日子
an extra special day.

334
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,785
讓我們為某人做一件好事
Let's do one nice thing for someone else,

335
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,050
但是不告訴任何人我們做過  好嗎
but not tell anyone else that we did it, okay?

336
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:23,996
好的
Okay.

337
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,987
要是拿7-2牌的人贏了  每人給十塊錢
Win with the seven-deuce, it's 10 bucks for everybody.

338
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:27,987
7-2  Poker里面最不可能贏的組合
所以必須有特殊規則來保護
否則拿到這種牌的人會直接放棄  也就是fold

339
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,894
分高低彩池都贏的話
Win both ways with the seven-deuce,

340
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,897
-每人二十塊  -杰克狂野嗎
- 20 bucks a head. - Jack's wild?

341
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,467
他當然不狂野
Jack's definitely not wild.

342
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,504
瑪莎  跟進嗎
Marsha, stay in?

343
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,072
你好
Hello?

344
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,019
請問這是杰克·瑪布里的家嗎  
Hi, is this Jack Mabry's place?

345
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,520
什么
Excuse me?

346
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,211
我叫露西塔·科里森  
Oh, my name is Lucetta Creeson.

347
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:42,806
我的丈夫...
My husband's...

348
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,811
對不起  我沒聽明白
Excuse me, I couldn't understand what-

349
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,189
我想找杰克·瑪布里  
Can I speak to Jack Mabry?

350
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,577
我是瑪布里夫人
Well, this is Mrs. Mabry.

351
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,312
好的  我能跟杰克對話嗎
Okay, can I speak to Jack?

352
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,821
你要找我丈夫的話  我可以給他帶個話
You need my husband. I can give him a mess-

353
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,200
-你找到他了嗎  -跟他太太說了幾句
- Hey, you get ahold of him? - She was a little short.

354
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,839
我也不知道
You know? Like, I don't know.

355
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,973
她好像不想跟我說什么
Like she didn't want to talk or something.

356
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,343
你為什么和她說話呢
Why-why-why you talkin' to her?

357
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,382
嘿  湯米  我們不能咬
Hey, Tommy, Tommy, we don't bite.

358
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,316
不能咬  好嗎
Huh-uh, no biting, okay?

359
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,123
你明白我在說什么嗎
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

360
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:28,014
我現在需要你幫我
I need you to do this for me right now.

361
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,182
就現在  別讓機會溜走
Right now. Don't let it slide.

362
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,488
好的  我會的
Okay, I will.

363
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,495
好嗎  今晚給他打電話
Okay? Call him tonight.

364
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,032
明天還給他打  明天晚上還給他打
Call him tomorrow. Call him tomorrow night.

365
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,693
后天還給他打  后天晚上還打
Call him the day after. Call him the day after tomorrow night.

366
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,902
我想知道
That's what I'm getting

367
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,898
你承認你之前做錯了嗎
at is do you believe what you did was wrong?

368
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,669
你在想什么  就因為我在西部長大
What-what d'you think, because I grew up westside

369
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,813
我就是不能分辨是非的
that like I'm one of these socio-delinquent types,

370
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,813
社會問題青年
don't know the difference between right and wrong?

371
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,418
你想知道我的悲慘童年和狗屎命運嗎
You want me to tell you about my bad childhood and shit?

372
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,917
我不知道  你曾經有嗎
I don't know. Did you have one?

373
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,414
你知道  在那時  
Well, you know, at the time,

374
00:22:58,415 --> 00:22:59,886
我認為干壞事都是正常的
I thought a lot of shit was normal.

375
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,049
這當然是不對的
It was definitely unhealthy,

376
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,559
但另一方面  我認為
but on the same token, you know, I didn't think

377
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,994
我本身并不壞
I was a bad person to begin with.

378
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,191
所以  我是說  你還想知道什么
So, you know, I mean, what, you want to know

379
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,530
我是否會點燃其他祖父母的房子嗎
if I'm gonna light any more grandparents on fire?

380
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,365
-你會嗎  -不會
- Are you? - No.

381
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,957
你還有祖父祖母在世嗎
You got any more?

382
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,531
還有一個
Yeah, I got one.

383
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,270
那你應該對那位老人好些
Yeah well, try to make a better effort with that one.

384
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,784
我并不是專門來找你麻煩的
I'm not trying to be flip.

385
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,752
我覺得我應該獲得自由
I think I deserve to be free, I do.

386
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,791
為什么  就因為你服滿刑期了嗎
Why, because you did the time?

387
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,775
就這樣  你準備好了嗎
That's it, you're ready?

388
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:39,759
你現在清白了嗎
Now you're a clean slate?

389
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,083
我跟所有人一樣清白  哥們  
I'm clean as anybody, man.

390
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:43,093
我跟你一樣清白
I'm clean as you.

391
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,895
也許是  也許不是
Well, maybe, maybe not.

392
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,766
真的  我想問問你
Seriously, let me ask you something, you know.

393
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,306
為什么你就能坐在那兒
Why are you- why are you- why are you gonna sit there,

394
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,773
問我這些問題  好像你從來沒犯過錯
like, asking me these questions like you never done nothin'?

395
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,040
為什么你能自由地進來出去而我就不能
I mean, you know, why do you get to walk around free and I don't?

396
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,944
我從沒有犯過罪
I wasn't convicted of a crime.

And they- it's a nest and they come and they take their twine

531
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,432
它們銜來的樹枝做成的小家
and their twigs and stuff and they make their little home.

532
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,041
謝謝
Thank you.

533
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,371
好的
Okay.

534
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,071
-很高興見到你  -謝謝
- Nice to meet you. - Thank you.

535
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,822
好了
Okay.

536
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,389
這到底是什么
What the hell is this?

537
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,623
-什么東西  -這個  你妻子給的
- What's that? - This...your wife.

538
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,993
什么  她寄給你的嗎
What, she sent it to you?

539
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,294
她剛才在停車場給我的
She gave it to me in the parking lot just now.

540
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,495
等等  什么  露西塔來找你了嗎
Wait, what, Lucetta come and find you?

541
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,664
她剛剛在停車場給我的  別想搗亂
She gave that to me in the parking lot. Don't mess with me.

542
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,106
我不想給你帶來任何麻煩
I ain't lookin' for any kind of trouble with you, you know.

543
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,142
我希望你沒有把她牽扯進來
I hope you didn't put her up to it.

544
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,440
到時候假釋小組直接給你寄駁回書
The parole board's gonna send you a flop in the mail

545
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,139
你連申辯的機會都不會有
and you won't even see them.

546
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,442
露西塔想干什么是她的事  
Lucetta does whatever the fuck she wants.

547
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:55,945
我跟你說
I told you, man.

548
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,678
她就是喜歡這些小孩子的玩意兒
She's just boisterous.

549
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,851
上帝啊  真是倒霉的一周
Jesus, what a week.

550
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,700
我想知道你對這個怎么看
Hey hey, I want to see what you think about something.

551
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,179
你看過這個嗎
You ever- you seen this?

552
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,208
我在圖書館找到的
I found it in the library.

553
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,220
《音禪  上帝的聲音和生命》
"Zukangor, The Sound and Life God."

554
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,880
是的  你知道它嗎
Yeah, you know it?

555
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,357
不
No.

556
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,860
書里說  聲音是一切的開始
They say the sound part come first.

557
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,555
他說  如果你感受到了
They say the- when you experience

558
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,065
心靈世界的真理
a spiritual truth

559
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,204
它會通過聲音來到你身邊
that it comes to you as a sound,

560
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,636
穿透你的身體
that it goes through you,

561
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,969
改變你的震頻  讓你回歸和諧
changes your vibration, gets you back into harmony.

562
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,510
就像上帝的調音叉
Like God's tuning fork or something.

563
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,148
如果你身體上發生這些變化
And then if you let that happen to you,

564
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,841
你就會得到光明
then- then you get the light,

565
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,419
得到啟示什么的
or you get illumination or something.

566
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,414
我沒聽過這些  我是主教派的
I wouldn't know about that. I'm an Episcopalian.

567
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,527
他們說  要從小事開始
They say it starts with small things,

568
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,528
比如一些小聲音  小震動
like little sounds, little vibrations,

569
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,563
比如電燈的嗡嗡聲
like a-just like a buzzing electric light

570
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,167
水流聲  或者蜜蜂的聲音
or rushing water or the sound of a bee or...

571
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,201
-是嗎  -是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

572
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,895
然后就會發展
And then it grows.

573
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,201
但是這不用教父什么的  它不像宗教
But there's no priest or nothing. It's not like a religion.

574
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,492
就是一個叫阿諾德的人  
There's just this one dude named Arnold

575
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:30,744
他是創始人
who's the Zukmaster.

576
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,406
書上說  你可以自己練習
They say you do this practice all by yourself.

577
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,849
你可以聽得更好
You can- you can hear better.

578
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,750
你可以通過聲音聽到上帝對你說話
You can hear God speaking to you through sounds.

579
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,413
什么練習
What's the practice?

580
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,787
-他們吟唱"Hue"  -Hue
- They chant "Hue. " - Hue?

581
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,089
-然后他們聆聽  -聽什么  蜜蜂嗎
- And then they listen. - For what, a bee?

582
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,423
可能吧  我不知道
Maybe, I don't know.

583
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,195
但是  關鍵是
But you know, the thing is

584
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,104
他們說你會不斷輪回
they say you got to keep coming back

585
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,041
直到你償還所有的罪孽
until you pay for all your shit.

586
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,545
你會用幾輩子的時間來償還
That you've got to fix it

587
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,947
直到所有罪孽都清算干凈
over a lot of lives, you know, until you work it all out.

588
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,644
好吧  那這輩子呢
Well, what about this life?

589
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,154
你這輩子做的事情呢
What about answering for

590
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,451
你該如何償還
the things that you've done in this life?

591
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,957
見鬼  我知道我已經償還了
Shit, I know I have.

592
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,962
是嗎
Have you?

593
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,623
是的  你呢
Yeah. Have you?

594
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,408
這是耶穌的身體  賜予你
This is the body of Christ, given for you.

595
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,478
耶穌的身體  賜予你
The body of Christ, given for you.

596
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,645
耶穌的身體  賜予你
The body of Christ, given for you.

597
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,808
-我一會兒回來  -好的
- I'll be right back. - Sure.

598
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,691
給你  你開車回家
Here, you drive home.

599
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,489
我去跟牧師聊一會兒  然后自己走回去
I'm going to talk to the pastor a minute and then I'll walk.

600
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,325
好的
Okay.

601
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,333
嘿  傻子 婊子
Hey yo, foul, bitch!

602
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,130
可惡  你這個傻子
Damn, that's a hard foul!

603
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,330
這個蠢驢
Yo, that's a foul!

604
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,780
Hue
Hue...

605
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,831
伙計  你應該扣下去的
Man, you should've dunked it!

606
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,839
好的  我以前從沒這樣做過
Okay, I've never done this before, so-

607
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,845
我是說  我每周
well, I mean, I come to the...

608
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,313
都來教堂  我努力嘗試
Church every week and I really try.

609
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,479
但是我不知道  我本來希望
And I don't know, I mean, I guess I had hoped with time

610
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,682
隨著時間會越來越容易
it would be easier and easier and...

611
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,919
而且
And I'd be...

612
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,689
我的家人  身邊的人
My family, people close to me,

613
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,029
對于他們似乎都很容易  但是對我
it seems to come to them easily, but for me it's...

614
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,729
我是說
I mean I've...

615
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,396
我不知道
I don't know.

616
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,073
我是說
I mean I've...

617
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,081
有時我的想法
Sometimes the thoughts that I have,

618
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,082
我的感覺...
feelings...

619
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,247
但是  有時
But, uh, sometimes

620
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,359
我只覺得你應該槍斃了我或怎樣
I just think maybe you should shoot me or something.

621
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,428
我認為這不是上帝的旨意
Well, I don't believe that that's what God wants for you.

622
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,361
好吧  那他要怎么樣
Well, what does he want?

623
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,799
我希望我能有個簡單的答案
I wish I had a simple answer for you.

624
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,701
我不確定上帝想讓你干什么
I'm not sure what God wants for you.

625
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,303
是否有...
Is there anything...

626
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,540
圣經有篇古老的短文說
There's an old Biblical passage that says...

627
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,614
"靜心  吾乃上帝"
"Be still and know that I am God. "

628
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,585
也就是說
Which is a way of saying

629
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,156
有時上帝確實
sometimes God does, um,

630
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,556
會以神秘的方式向我們說話
speak to us in mysterious ways.

631
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,970
離開護欄
Off the rail!

632
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,979
我說  離開護欄
I said off the rail!

633
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,539
你好
Hello?

634
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,974
嗨  我是露西塔·科里森  我們上星期談過
Hi, this is Lucetta Creeson. We talked last week.

635
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,444
抱歉  再說下你名字?
I'm sorry, what is your name again?

636
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,514
露西塔·科里森
Lucetta Creeson.

637
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,050
我只想問下杰克在不在家
I was just wondering if Jack was home.

638
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,779
恐怕他還在  等等  別掛
I'm afraid he's still- oh no, wait, hold on.

639
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:09,221
-杰克  電話  -是誰
- Jack, telephone.  - Who is it? Who? Who is it?

640
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,121
你的一個朋友?
A friend of yours?

641
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,293
-你好  -嘿
- Hello.  - Hey.

642
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,125
我是露西塔·科里森
It's Lucetta Creeson.

643
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,494
我只想問
Listen, I was just wondering, um,

644
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,693
我們什么時候可以見個面
when we could meet, when we could get together.

645
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,898
科里森夫人  我不知你怎么弄到我家電話的
Uh, Mrs. Creeson, I don't know how you're calling my house,

646
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,633
但我告訴過你打給辦公室
but I told you to call the office.

647
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,368
我只是
Well, look, I'm just,

648
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,037
不擅長辦公  而且
I'm not that great at offices and, you know,

649
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,514
在辦公室我說不了真心話
I just- I just can't be real, like, in an office, you know?

650
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,550
-科里森夫人  -露西塔
- Look, Mrs. Creeson  - Lucetta.

651
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,054
科里森夫人  我在審核你丈夫的檔案
Mrs. Creeson, I have business with your husband.

652
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,385
正因為這樣我才打電話
Well, that's why I'm calling.

653
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,550
你覺得還有其他原因嗎
I mean, what, did you think I had another reason?

654
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,321
沒有  我沒那樣想
Well, no, I didn't.

655
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,073
或許我們可以一起午餐
Maybe we could go to lunch,

656
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:50,398
你可以帶上瑪布里夫人
you could bring Mrs. Mabry too.

657
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,263
她聲音很甜  她的名是什么來著
You know, she's got a sweet voice. What's her first name?

658
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,062
聽著  我很欣賞你如此愛你丈夫
Look, I admire that you love your husband

659
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,603
想給他幫忙
and you want to do what's right for him,

660
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,765
但我現在告訴你  你這是在幫倒忙
but you're not helping him. I'm telling you that right now.

661
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,774
聽我說  杰克
Listen to me, Jack.

662
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,004
我的確愛我丈夫
I do love my husband.

663
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,943
我如此
I love my husband

664
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,381
愛我丈夫
so much.

665
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,189
我所要求的只是一個
And all I'm asking you is for a chance

666
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,121
幫助你從不同角度認識他的機會
to help you see him in a different light.

667
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,928
我是說  你工作那地方有多少人
I mean, how many men at that place you work at

668
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,464
會有這樣愛他們的女人
have somebody loving them like that, huh?

669
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,197
難道這都不能讓你動下惻隱之心嗎
Doesn't that mean something to you,

670
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,930
你手中控制的可是他人的命運啊
a man in a position like yours?

671
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,133
這  確實  別誤會我
It-it- no, it-it does, it does. Don't misunderstand me.

672
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,870
我只想要他回家
I just want him home.

673
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,482
我如此  需要他
I want... I want him so bad.

674
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,948
我要他擁抱我
I want his arms around me.

675
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,451
我要他在我床上
I want him in my bed.

676
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,954
我想念他
I miss him.

677
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,285
我不能說服你么
Can't I persuade you?

678
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,621
受傷的會是誰
Who's it gonna hurt, hmm?

679
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,061
就讓我來見你吧  拜托
Just let me come see you, please.

680
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,993
讓我來見你  杰克
Let me come see you, Jack.

681
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,904
我吊上他了
I got him.

682
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,978
會搞定的  寶貝
It's gonna happen, baby.

683
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,309
甜心  你沒事吧
Huh. Honey, you okay?

684
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,183
我太他媽累了
I'm so fuckin' tired.

685
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,759
睡不著嗎
Can't you sleep?

686
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,794
這里一直吵個不停
No, it's too loud all the time.

687
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,022
吵得我無法
So noisy I can't...

688
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,759
我無法靜下心來
I can't get out of my head.

689
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,165
什么都聽不到
I can't hear nothin'. I can't listen.

690
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,000
這地方開始讓我頭腦混亂了
This place is startin' to mess with my head.

691
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,541
跟你說  我最近在做很奇怪的夢
I'm tellin' you, I'm having these weird~ass dreams.

692
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,679
可憐
Poor honey.

693
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,885
我想自殺
I thought I wanted to kill myself, right?

694
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,222
想找個偏僻的地方把自己吊死
Thought
