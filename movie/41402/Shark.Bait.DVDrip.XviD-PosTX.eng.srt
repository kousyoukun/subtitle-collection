1
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,454
If you'll indulge for a moment
my rhyming motif,

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,559
I'd like to tell you a tale
of a place called the Reef.

3
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:32,130
The entire coral kingdom is
a delight to the senses...

4
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,326
Alas, that is not where
our story commences.

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,731
We're used to blue water,
this water would spook us,

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:47,745
It's the color of phlegm,
or possibly mucus.

7
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,942
And the salty sea spray
that wafts on the breeze,

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,348
Is like the stuff that comes out
of your nose when you sneeze.

9
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,751
In this polluted and ominous swill,

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:03,227
There was one little fish
of unusual skill...

11
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,331
Who would one day meet
a most incredible fate,

12
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:11,927
Full of fighting! Romancing!
Becoming live bait!

13
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,338
I know it boggles the mind
and beggars belief,

14
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,139
But that's the wee lad
who'd one day save the Reef.

15
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,740
Shark Bait

16
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:36,328
I don't have anything against
your cousin Pearl... except she's nuts.

17
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,328
But that doesn't mean
I wanna live next door to her.

18
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,524
But Pike, it's safe on the Reef.

19
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,225
There's no fishing,
the water's clean...

20
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,529
But honey, I love Boston.

21
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,832
What's the big attraction?
Is it the gill nets?

22
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,339
The medical waste?
The industrial pollution?

23
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,036
- Hey, it's never hurt me.
- Oh please, Pike.

24
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,839
Sweetie, you're so full of mercury

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,141
I could stick your tail in my mouth
and take my temperature.

26
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,049
Honey, you're exaggerating.
The water here is perfectly healthy.

27
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,553
- Hey, Pike.
- Morning, Bob.

28
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:05,557
Honey.

29
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,125
And what if Pi grows up
to have three eyes?

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,420
Cool!

31
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,929
Okay, but think of the cultural
opportunities here.

32
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,830
In Boston Harbor, Pi can meet
fish from all over the world!

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,030
Oh like those salmon?
What a classy bunch they were.

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,936
All of them talking
about how they just

35
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,738
couldn't wait to
get up river and... S-P-A-W-N.

36
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,346
Spawn!

37
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,648
What did I tell you about
using language like that?

38
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,751
I'm sorry!

39
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,548
Oh, you're growing up so fast...

40
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,555
Go play, sweetheart.
Your father and I need to talk.

41
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,248
Okay!

42
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,826
- But don't go too far!
- Pike!

43
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,732
- Hey!
- Oh! Hallo!

44
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,429
Haven't seen you around here before.

45
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,337
I'm just passing through.
We're migrating.

46
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,535
You're lucky. I wish I migrated.

47
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,842
We never go anywhere.
You're a dolphin, right?

48
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,849
I'm a porpoise! Why does
everyone think I'm a dolphin?

49
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,452
Percy, darling,
we've getting ready to leave...

50
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,953
Oh! Hallo, Mum.
This is... uh...

51
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,556
Pi! Where are you?

52
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,717
Oh, that's my mom,
I gotta go.

53
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,726
Nice meeting you!

54
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,023
Mom! Dad!
I met a porpoise!

55
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,930
Pi! What did I tell you
about talking to strangers?

56
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,937
You have to be careful, son.

57
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,938
Boy, I'll say!

58
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,043
You wouldn't believe some
of the weirdos you see around here.

59
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,645
Bob... Don't help me.

60
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,944
- Hey! Watch it! What's the rush?
- It's a net!

61
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,642
- Net?
- Swim!

62
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,151
What are we gotta do?

63
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,857
- Pike! Swim!
- Swim as fast as you can!

64
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,620
- What is it?
- Swim, Pi!

65
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,424
Swim!

66
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,037
Pike! We've got to get him
out of here before they...

67
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,142
They're pulling it up!

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,638
Pi! Try to squeeze through!

69
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,543
But... What about you?

70
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,343
We're right behind you. Hurry!

71
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,943
Push Pi!
Push harder!

72
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,857
I made it! Come on!

73
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,619
Mom! Dad!

74
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,428
- Don't let him get near the net!
- Let go of me! I have to help 'em!

75
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,534
Pi! Go to the Reef!
Find your Aunt Pearl!

76
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,930
Promise me, Pi!

77
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,333
I can't! You have to go with me!

78
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,134
Promise me, Pi!
Promise me you'll go to the Reef!

79
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,835
Mom! Dad!

80
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,352
Mom... Dad...

81
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,823
- We'll take you to the Reef,
- Pi. But I can't leave.

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,231
What if they, what if they come back
and I'm not here?

83
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,931
- They won't be able to find me.
- I'm sorry, Pi.

84
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,033
But once the net gets you...
there's no coming back.

85
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,545
Mom... Dad...

86
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,135
Come on, Pi!

87
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,741
Your turn!

88
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,934
- Hey, what's in here?
- Let's find out!

89
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,443
Hey, you kids!

90
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,448
Pi, you can do it!

91
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,825
- Cool!
- Hey, hello there?

92
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,624
- Really big!
- Huge!

93
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,724
Wow, wonderful.

94
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,852
Hey! Wait! Wait!

95
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,327
You all right?
Try again!

96
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,136
Look at me!

97
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,037
Wow!

98
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,531
Hahaha, little fish...
It's not painful while I eat you,

99
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,837
I'm gonna swallow you whole.

100
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,041
Hey!

101
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,342
What the... Bad fish!

102
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,429
Pi! That was brilliant!

103
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,030
You sure you won't come with us?

104
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,623
I wish I could, Perc,
but I promised my mom.

105
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,736
There you go, dear.

106
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,237
Just follow those stones,
and they'll take you right to the Reef.

107
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:31,332
I'll never forget you help,
Mum. So long, Perc.

108
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,445
S'Iong, mate.

109
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,648
Wow!

110
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,828
- Dokdo is whose land?
It's Korean.

111
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,143
It was a 55-foot trawler,

112
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,947
and they we're using a three-pronged
titanium steel hook on 45-pound,

113
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,055
stress-tested monofilament.

114
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,850
I must have played 'em
for three hours

115
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,016
before the line finally snapped
and they got away.

116
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,324
55-foot trawler. Right...
Oh, like I haven't heard that one before.

117
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,425
I tell ya... That boat gets bigger
every time he tells the story

118
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,126
Excuse me?

119
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,829
What's a matter, boychik?
You lost?

120
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,439
How's that?
What'd he say?

121
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,236
He says he's lost!
You deaf marlin.

122
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,843
Actually, I'm looking
for my Aunt Pearl.

123
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,538
- You're lookin' for a squirrel?
- No, no, Pearl!

124
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,149
He's looking for the crazy lady!

125
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,049
Oh, ee. Come here.
She lives right down there, chico.

126
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,950
Thank you.

127
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,438
That is right, darling.
Work with me!

128
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,233
Now take it to the edge.

129
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:14,738
Yes! Take it to the edge...
take it right to the edge...

130
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,448
YOU'RE RIGHT AT THE EDGE!
Bring it back!

131
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:23,044
Oh, yes, yeah!
Magnifique!

132
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,657
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

133
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,624
That's Cordelia, dude.
Where've you been?

134
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,023
I just got into town.

135
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,222
Oh. Welcome to the Scab, dude.

136
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,924
Perhaps you should
wear it up.

137
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:40,232
Oh, Yes! Sleek, sophisticated.
Like Audrey Hepburn.

138
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,933
Only better... with scales!

139
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:47,437
- She's beautiful.
- Oh yeah. She's a model.

140
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,844
She've been on the cover
of National Geographic.

141
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,244
Twice!

142
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,944
Don't look over here!

143
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,247
Ignore me... Look at me!

144
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,151
I've got to meet her.

145
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,816
Whoa there, newbie. Newbie.
Take my advice and worship from afar.

146
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,355
Uh? What?

147
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,924
No, no, no, no.

148
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,120
You're ruined my shot!
Baffoon! Baffoon!

149
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,424
Can we please keep the local
riffraff out of my shot?

150
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,226
Is that too much to ask?

151
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,835
Sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,431
That's your good side.

153
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,633
That is a wrap, people!

154
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:53,336
I don't blame you, mon cher.
You were sublime, as always

155
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,743
- Thank you, Max.
- Belissima! Ciao!

156
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,242
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to mess things up back there.

157
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,449
Don't worry about it.
They'll be back

158
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,821
Oh, cool, cool.

159
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,428
So I'm Pi.
I'm new in town.

160
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,930
Really?
I couldn't tell.

161
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,330
Yeah, I just swam
in from Boston.

162
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,528
Boston?
That's a long way.

163
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,129
Well, you know I'm pretty
strong for my size.

164
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,036
Check these mussels?

165
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,837
- Hey!
- Hands off the merchandise!

166
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,446
Oww! Hey. Easy, man!

167
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,550
Cute and funny.
What did you say your name was?

168
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,318
I'm PI.

169
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,344
Well, Pi from Boston,
welcome to the Reef.

170
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,319
Dude. She actually
talked to you!

171
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:47,228
That's fully the most awesome
thing I've ever... seen?

172
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,943
Cordelia, look out!

173
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,243
Dude, don't!
He's a shark!

174
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,748
Ohhhh. Hello fellas.

175
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,354
- Help me! Somebody help me!
- Here you go, Mr. Crab.

176
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,549
Thank you so very much!

177
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,024
I have been
wrong-side up all day

178
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,529
and it has been
most uncomfortable, ohhhhh!

179
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,131
- You taste like tuna!
- You are what you eat.

180
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,943
You're disgusting, Troy!
Why can't you leave me alone?

181
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,740
But you are alone,
sweet gilles.

182
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,544
No family, no one to protect you
from the dangers of the deep.

183
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,653
The only danger in this part
of the deep is you.

184
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,154
Well then. All the more reason
to get on my good side.

185
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,816
You need someone
to look after you.

186
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,219
I don't need a rude, egotistical bully
with a bad case of tuna breath!

187
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,025
- Back off!
- Pi!

188
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,532
- What did you say?
- You heard me. Leave her alone.

189
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,933
What are you gonna
do about it, Chum?

190
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,837
- I'm... gonna...
- You're gonna,

191
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,139
Oh yeah, you're gonna take a little trip...
through my digestive system.

192
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,545
Man, you're getting' chunky!
It used to be easy to stuff you into this hole.

193
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,245
We're gonna have to find
a bigger hole,
or a skinnier nerd!

194
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,756
Yikes! No more beating up
bad weathers.

195
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,621
I'm grossed out!

196
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,318
Let's get outta here!

197
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,524
- Nobody close into my hole! Nobody!
- I can pick my old dough.

198
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,933
Forget about him, he doesn't
know what he's saying!

199
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,637
Yeah... That tends to happen
when you get smacked in the head.

200
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,743
Hey!

201
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,347
You're a coward, Troy!

202
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,450
You only come to the Reef because
we're small and easy to push around

203
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:49,042
Why don't you try this act out there,
in the open sea, where there're fish as big as you?

204
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,352
I've got a soft spot, Cordelia,
for fine looking fish like you.

205
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,121
But don't push me too far.
I'm Troy.

206
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,129
Who's the shark
who's more bite than bark?

207
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,428
Troy!

208
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,936
Who's faster than a beam of light?
Who's got the teeth that are pearly white?

209
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,936
Troy!

210
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,734
Who gets the applause
'cause he's got the jaws?

211
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,743
Who can do what
he wants just because?

212
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,937
Who ain't afraid of
no lobster claws?

213
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,240
Troy!

214
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,247
Hey, that's me.

215
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,844
I'll be back when you're done
playing mommy to that little hunk of bait.

216
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,148
Vamanos...

217
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,527
- You got fully thrashed, dude.
- What?

218
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,829
Axed. Hemo-ed. Smeared. Creamed,

219
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:41,429
obliterated, flattened,
murdered, wipe out!

220
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,541
That wasn't the smartest
thing I've ever seen.

221
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,837
He hit me when I wasn't looking!

222
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,741
There's only one dangerous place
on the Reef.

223
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,847
And that's between Troy
and whatever he wants.

224
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,449
Go home and get that
taken care of yourself.

225
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,952
- What... Cordelia!
- Troy is my problem,

226
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,047
and I don't want anyone else
getting hurt on my account.

227
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,657
But...

228
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,719
- Busy first day, dude.
- Yeah.

229
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,330
Listen, I've gotta find my aunt Pearl.

230
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,527
She's supposed to be
this weird kind of New Age,

231
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,436
fortune teller type sort of...
- koo, koo!

232
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,439
You know, crazy,
Basically insane.

233
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:21,842
- You don't happen to know her, do you?
- Yeah, dude. She's my mom.

234
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:31,247
I see it... yes. Oh boy,
that doesn't look good.

235
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,621
What do you see?
Will my dreams come true?

236
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,422
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

237
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,124
Do your dreams involve sitting on a sink
next to a bottle of dishwashing liquid?

238
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,631
This can't be!

239
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,829
My cousin's a loofah! She's exfoliated
some of the most prominent backsides around!

240
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,236
But I get to
scrub pots?

241
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,535
NO!

242
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,645
Curse you,
star-crossed DESTINY!

243
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,247
Sponges.
They're all so emotional.

244
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,943
At least she's not stuck in this pinnacle
all day and you get all the pretty!

245
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,848
Sorry, Madge.

246
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,748
- Dude.
- Dylan!

247
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,917
Ohh! Pi!
You made it!

248
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,825
- You knew I was coming?
- Of course darling.

249
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,330
While meditating, my astral form
achieved a transcendent communion

250
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,730
with none other than
the Spirit of the Sea!

251
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:22,535
And it revealed to me
a vision of your arrival!

252
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,132
And a passing porpoise mentioned
you were in the neighborhood.

253
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,444
Then... you know
what happened to my parents.

254
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,640
Oh, Pi, I'm so sorry!

255
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,252
But I think they're
in a better place now

256
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,354
Yeah. In a sushi bar.

257
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,355
- Can it stop, fish!
- Don't hurt me!

258
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,016
The Reef is where
you'll find your destiny, honey

259
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,026
Give me your fin,
I'll tell your fortune...

260
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,721
Oh, fish...

261
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,630
Boy, let's see chapter two.

262
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,441
Hey, I can't wait to
see all these sentences!

263
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,635
Here come the Pull
on dorsal fin probe.

264
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,246
I don't really
believe in that stuff.

265
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,841
The Reef is a place
where dreams come true.

266
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,351
Unless you happen to
be a sponge.

267
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,651
Now Pi, the Reef is paradise,

268
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,226
and you can go
anywhere you want.

269
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,125
But stay away from the old wreck.
It's haunted by dead pirates.

270
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,231
Cool!

271
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,423
And most important of all:

272
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,832
We never, ever, ever
go to Flatbottom.

273
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,133
- What's Flatbottom?
- It's a place we never go.

274
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,141
Awe Mom. You're not going out
in public like that, are you?

275
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,248
I like to have a little star quality.

276
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,842
Plus, It gives me more height and
helps to de-emphasize my tail fin.

277
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,352
Right?

278
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:47,823
I'm gonna need some time freshen up first,
I got like five armpits over here.

279
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,123
Is that Ricky Marlin?

280
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,430
Is that Ricky Marlin?

281
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,734
No, huh. But almost.

282
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,644
Oh, hello, Dr. Tang!

283
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,243
He's a very prominent sturgeon.

284
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,946
You see why I always
try to look my best,

285
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,250
you never know
who you might meet.

286
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,827
- What do you think?
- What? No. Ha. No. No.

287
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,627
It clashes with the beer can.

288
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,429
I think it'd look
better over there.

289
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,630
You've crushing
my creative instincts.

290
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,642
Check out the bling-bling
on Miss Thing!

291
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,338
Oh, hello you two.

292
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,846
More like J-Lo jellyfish.
So crazy.

293
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,847
- Hello
- Looking good

294
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,850
Oh, you two are such flirts!

295
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,151
Don't stop... Don't stop!

296
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,924
Oh, clams!

297
00:19:56,061 --> 00:20:00,122
I'm late for my healing crystal seminar
at the monkfish monastery,

298
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,632
So Dylan, I want you
to introduce Pi around. Okay?

299
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,135
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks, Sweetie.

300
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,832
- No PDPA. Remember?
- PDPA?

301
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,138
Public Displays of
Parental Affection.

302
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,643
Excuse me, sir...
I'm not proud.

303
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,850
Dude, that was
totally feebish.

304
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:22,954
You can't be that big a feeb
and expect to hang out with me.

305
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,350
Well, how big a feeb
can I be?

306
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,720
Well, you can't be more than 30% feeb,
and no more than 15% dork.

307
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,020
Hey! What's that?

308
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,226
- That's the old pirate ship.
- Cool. Come on!

309
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,924
No way, dude, now way.
It's totally off-limits.

310
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,036
That's wonderful!

311
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,730
Dude, I'm... Man!
Don't you listen!

312
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,533
You're not afraid of
ghosts, are you?

313
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,040
No, I'm not afraid of anything!

314
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,237
But Dude, there's a totally spooky
turtle that lives in there.

315
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,644
A spooky... turtle?

316
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:56,345
No. No. Yeah. No. But yeah...
But he's a wizard turtle!

317
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,048
And he really doesn't
like visitors.

318
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:04,925
Dude! Oh... fish.
Ok, can we please just go? Please!

319
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,227
That's him, you see.
That's Nerissa.

320
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,442
Can we please not do that again?

321
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,848
So, dude, you think you're
gonna see that Cordelia?

322
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,250
Ugh. Not if she sees me first.

323
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,552
Don't be negatory, bro.
I think she really liked you.

324
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,126
She thinks I'm an idiot.

325
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,819
True. Well, maybe she likes idiots.

326
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,228
It's kinda like having a friend
and a pet at the same time.

327
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,424
So how bad is the shark
problem around here?

328
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,229
Well, reef's too shallow for most sharks.
But Troy comes around

329
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,137
every full moon, weee, fun for me,
you know. Him and his buddies.

330
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,333
Why?

331
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,934
'Cause he's got a thing for Cordelia,
dude! Don't you listen?

332
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,344
His buddies just come mostly
to stuff my head into a lobster hole.

333
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,452
Yeah, like nobody
ever thought of that before.

334
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,349
- Oh oh...
- What is it?

335
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,752
- Flatbottom.
- It's the open sea.

336
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,223
Why is everyone
so afraid of this place?

337
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,021
I'm NOT afraid...!

338
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,528
But we're outside the Wildlife Sanctuary.

339
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,132
You see. And, and, this is where
the humans come with their nets

340
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,735
and their hooks
and their sharp things.

341
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,432
The net!

342
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,443
Bye bye.

343
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,847
Dylan?

344
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,122
Dylan! Dylan!

345
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,950
What happened to you little fella?

346
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,855
Are you all right?

347
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,918
Cordelia!

348
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,526
- Don't panic!
- What is it?

349
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,324
Haven't you ever seen a lure?

350
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,025
Of course you haven't.
There's no fishing on the Reef.

351
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,931
This must have been carried here
by the current.

352
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,833
- What'll I do?
- Don't worry.

353
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,337
I think I know someone who can help.

354
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,736
We need some help over here!

355
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,843
Front and center, girlfriend.
We got an emergency.

356
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:40,440
- Look!
- Oh, honey! That is so not you!

357
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,248
I tell you, these kids today, with their
extreme sports and their piercings.

358
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,357
Guys, it was an accident.

359
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,621
- I thought it was a smelt in distress.
- You were supposed to, honey.

360
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,926
Good likeness. Looks like a smelt
I knew back in San Francisco...

361
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,124
Oh, what a weekend that was.

362
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,032
Oh no, not this story again!

363
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,230
- Can you take it out?
- Absolutely!

364
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,034
But you're going to have to
help me big time.

365
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:03,834
Me?

366
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,240
Ok, you lay back like
I'm giving you nice pedicure.

367
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,746
Now what I need you to do is
to take her fin... that's right.

368
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:15,251
And Honey, I want you to
look into his eyes, okay?

369
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:21,519
Ok, now this isn't going to hurt... me.
You gonna be a brave girl?

370
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,823
- I will.
- She will.

371
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,329
She was!

372
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,430
- How do you feel?
- Okay, I think.

373
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,130
I guess I was more
scared than hurt.

374
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,639
But I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't been there, Pi.

375
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,046
- How'd you wind up down here?
- I made a promise...

376
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,543
Or maybe it's destiny.

377
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,450
Well... there's a big show tonight
at the Amphitheater.

378
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:55,823
Normally I skip it. But I thought...
well if you wanna go...

379
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,734
Bong-bong... BONG-bong...

380
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,138
Ha, ha, ha. We got it!

381
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,543
But getting, and keeping,
are two different things.

382
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,043
Back off, before you get hurt.

383
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,949
~Got a date with Cordelia,
cause you're a big bad fish, ya.

384
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,850
Zip it, Harry codfish junior.

385
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,549
- Where you've been?
- I was hiding out.

386
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,627
- From who?
- Squidnappers!

387
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,229
That trying to steal
Nerissa's blue pearl, buddy boy.

388
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,922
Well, come on!

389
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,225
Hey!

390
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,233
Dude! Oh fish!

391
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,338
Now, I'm no fortune-teller, boys,

392
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,032
but I can predict three things
that aren't gonna happen:

393
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,642
You see,

394
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,339
I'm not gonna get hurt.
I'm not gonna back off.

395
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,642
We're gotta do something.

396
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,149
Dude. Getting beat up once a day
isn't good enough for you?

397
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,548
There's three of them!

398
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,847
Get him!

399
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,226
You took left!

400
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,440
Hey, come back here!

401
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,745
Trick or treat?

402
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,333
Quit now, before you're calamari.

403
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,732
I got the sauce right here.
I'm not afraid to use it.

404
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,929
What a old man!

405
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,944
You turtle!
I don't feel so good!

406
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,322
See you later.

407
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,533
Such big heads.
Such tiny brains.

408
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,637
- Wow
- Turtlely awesome.

409
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:22,933
Let's go.

410
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,243
That old turtle's
unbelievable!

411
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,442
- You boys saw Nerissa?
- Speak up, son.

412
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,849
We saw Nerissa fight some squids!
He was amazing!

413
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,249
Of course.

414
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,449
That's why they call him
el macho tor tuga.

415
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,617
Man he've got the moves awesomely
for an old coots.

416
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,126
Oh, sorry.
Sorry about that old coots.

417
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,322
- Huh?
- He said old coot!

418
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,126
No, I did not toot!

419
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,326
Why don't you accuse Manny for once?

420
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,528
He blasts out more bubbles
than a scuba diver.

421
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,731
What you say man?

422
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,239
Hold up a second.
What' you say?

423
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:02,244
That's it, viejo loco!
I've had enough of your insults!

424
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,849
En garde! En garde!

425
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,443
Spirit of the Sea!

426
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:13,546
We ask your help in contacting,
Uncle Phil.

427
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,922
He was last seen...

428
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:16,720
La, la, la, LA,
la, la, la, LA!

429
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,419
Where?
Where was he seen?

430
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,724
I'm not listening,
I'm not listening this... La, la, la, LA,

431
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,127
What're you doing?

432
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,928
Dude, you saw
what was goin'on down there.

433
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,331
My mom with all
her voodoo mumbo jumbo.

434
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,133
Those seances are totally embarrassing.
You know what, I think you're right.

435
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,536
I think swimming through
the middle of the room going,

436
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:35,635
'La la, LA LA LA LA! 'is
much more dignified.

437
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,941
So what's that thing
your mom's always staring at?

438
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,246
Oh, that's the pearl my dad gave her.

439
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,152
You know the old saying,
'give a girl a pearl?

440
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,823
Why would anyone want to
give a girl a pearl?

441
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,623
Cause if she accepts it,
it means you'll be together forever.

442
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,322
Anyway, My Mom thinks hers is magic.

443
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,232
Hey, that's what those squids
were trying to steal from Nerissa... a pearl!

444
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,827
You don't think he's gonna ask
some girl to marry him, do you?

445
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,737
Oh, gross, no, dude!

446
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,640
He's like 200 years old!
That's disgusting.

447
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,625
- Hi!
- Hey!

448
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,729
It's showtime!

449
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,037
Welcome, to the Reef Amphitheater.

450
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:44,444
We are proud to present
the Caribbean's most famous adventurer,

451
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:48,643
who is here tonight to tell
the thrilling tales of his encounters

452
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,153
with the sea's
most fearsome creatures.

453
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,122
Ladies and gentlemen,
give up for... Thornton!

454
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,717
And his back-up prawns,
the Kim Chi!

455
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,319
I could make you all gasp
with just an average story

456
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,830
for even my typical tales
are scary and gory

457
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:44,739
But I know the adventure you're aching
to hear The most stupendous!

458
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:49,939
And horrendous battle
of my entire career!

459
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,948
He faced a creature that would
make you faint dead with fear!

460
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,552
The most hideous sea monster
to ever appear!

461
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,350
It had two mouths,
and on each mouth a sneer!

462
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,924
It had two heads! And looked like
a giant brassier!

463
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,724
I faced a sea monster
but I didn't make tracks.

464
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,631
I stood face to face
and fought off her attacks.

465
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,737
And I know that you'll
want to get all of the facts.

466
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,841
So stick a fin in your ear
and dig out the wax.

467
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,533
Dig the wax from your ears,
you'll seem more debonair

468
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:22,635
'cause it looks like you've stuck
two big candles in there.

469
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,047
It was a monstrous sea monster,
the size of a tanker!

470
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,244
What did you do?

471
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,548
I capsized and sank her.

472
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,951
And then were you through?

473
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,925
Not a bit! She was brawny.
And strong as an anchor!

474
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:42,727
I had to get tough
I tickled and spanked her!

475
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,630
What an amazing sight!

476
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,237
When it was over
I thanked her.

477
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,230
Because I am always polite.

478
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,742
I'm fairly certain,
this guy is full of blowfish.

479
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,541
I hear you say 'But! '
And you say 'Tut! Tut'

480
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,742
Things are not always
what they appear

481
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:04,150
I may have gray whiskers
and an oversized rear...

482
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,417
His butt is humongous!
It must weigh a ton

483
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,321
It frightens small children
And blots out the sun!

484
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,121
What are you doing?

485
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,530
That's not in the script!
Are you mad? You're running!

486
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,931
It's a big bulging billowing
blubber-stuffed rump!

487
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,436
It's bigger by far than
a humpback whale's hump!

488
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,739
- Hey, Max! Bring up the music!
- Hit it boy! Quickly!

489
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,343
Go Thornton!
You're humongous!

490
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,246
Thank you!

491
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,830
That was quite
an amazing story.

492
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,329
It's getting late,
I guess I better go.

493
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,735
No, wait. Don't go. Not yet.

494
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,738
Well, I...

495
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:03,238
- Have you ever been to the surface?
- No.

496
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,142
Come on!

497
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,822
Wow!

498
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,828
See that set of stars over there?

499
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,830
That's called the Big Dipper.
And that over there is the Little Dipper...

500
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,729
I had no idea!

501
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,736
And up there is
Leo and next to it, Gemini

502
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,534
And see that one over there?
Well, that's me...

503
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,040
Huh?

504
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,736
Those stars are called Pisces.

505
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,347
Pi is for Pisces.

506
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,840
Beautiful...

507
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,049
Boo! Let's get out of here!

508
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,623
Hurry, Cordelia!

509
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,125
You'd better be scared.

510
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,829
- Well hello.
- Go, Pi. Leave me.

511
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,337
I won't

512
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,633
No!

513
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:07,441
Leave him alone!

514
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,637
Oh well I'm confused, baby,

515
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,841
cause I thought you wanted
to be left alone,

516
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,147
and yet I find you swimming around
with that piece of chum.

517
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,848
It's none of your business what I do, Troy.
You don't own me.

518
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,620
I'm a tiger shark, baby.
I own whatever I can take,

519
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,628
and I take whatever I want.

520
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,825
Troy!

521
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,026
- Can I eat him?
- Eenie, meeney,

522
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,435
- ah miney...
- Troy!

523
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,235
Oh, what the heck.
Why don't you each take half?

524
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,243
NO! Troy, if you let them do this,
I'll never forgive you.

525
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,942
Forgiveness. I don't need
your stinking forgiveness.

526
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,549
Please! Please!
If you don't hurt him...

527
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,721
I'll do anything

528
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,124
Like... anything, anything?

529
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,226
If you leave Pi alone, and promise never
to come to the Reef again,

530
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:06,234
- then... I'II... I'II...
- Yeah?

531
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,736
Accept your pearl.

532
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,341
- No!
- Hey!

533
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,740
Let our little chum go.

534
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,438
Cordelia, you can't...

535
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,846
I'll be back at
the next full Moon.

536
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,151
Wait till you see the pearl
I'm gonna bring you little girl.

537
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,225
You'll change your mind
about me then.

538
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,520
Vamanos!

539
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,927
So baby, when I get back,
be ready.

540
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:38,832
I got thirty days
to live it up and party!

541
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,438
Who's the hotshot
who can't be caught?

542
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,732
Troy!

543
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,140
- Who's twice as mean as an ocelot?
- Troy!

544
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,140
Oh, Pi...

545
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,521
What could I do?

546
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,325
You know the rules of the sea...
you can't leave a man adrift like that.

547
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,832
Owww, my head...

548
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,731
I wouldn't be so hasty, kid.

549
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,739
That shark did quite a number
on your sorry tail.

550
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,740
How did I get here?

551
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,041
Well, the currents brought you here
and dumped ya outside.

552
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,140
If it wasn't for your pretty lady friend.

553
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,343
Cordelia! Is she all right?

554
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,044
She spent the night bawlin'
at your side.

555
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,452
I finally had to send her home
to get some peace and quiet around here.

556
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,219
I've got to stop her.
She's gonna accept Troy's pearl.

557
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,128
I sorry kid. She seemed very determined
to go through with it.

558
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,027
Then I'll stop Troy.

559
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,929
You're gonna to stop a tiger shark?

560
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,036
Is that whatjust came
out of your mouth, just know?

561
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,833
Yeah... you're right.

562
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:54,836
Determined women and tiger sharks.
You don't pick easy fights, do ya kid?

563
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:55,638
Well what about you?

564
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,248
I ain't helping you with
your love life, kid. Forget it.

565
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,545
- Everybody says your a wizard!
- Oh, do they now?

566
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,950
Yeah, and I saw
you beat those squids.

567
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,750
Three of them at once!
You totally rocked!

568
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,518
Can you help me fight Troy?

569
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,321
- Go fight your own battle kid.
- Please.

570
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,726
Haven't you ever been
in love before?

571
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,326
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,150
Hey boychick,
why the long face?

573
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,653
- I bet it's about a girl.
- Did you say Pearl?

574
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,622
Actually, that't my problem.

575
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,626
The girl I like... Cordelia
she's gonna accept Troy's pearl.

576
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,525
That Troy's a punk!

577
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,828
Why, back in my day,
we, we knew how to handle sharks like that.

578
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,529
You never fought a shark, Jack.

579
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,832
Oh yes I did.

580
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,134
Took on a 25-foot hammerhead back in '71.

581
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,744
- Really?
- Yep.

582
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:04,143
Poked him right in the keister.
Right where the sun never shines.

583
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,344
He'll never forget me,
I guarantee ya that.

584
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,648
I wouldn't put a whole lotta stock
in what Jack says, chico.

585
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,551
You calling me crazy?!

586
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,521
You questioning
my credibility, boy?

587
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,719
For about the tenth time today, yes!

588
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,728
- All right! That's it. Put'm up.
- En garde!

589
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:34,836
Hey! Would you guys
help me fight Troy?

590
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,743
Get the seacup out of
your mouth, son. Speak up.

591
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,443
He wants us to,
fight the SHARK!

592
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,350
My back!

593
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,823
Man! These cartilage crabs
are killin'me.

594
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,229
Well, you see chico
we've what you call past our prime...

595
00:38:54,365 --> 00:39:00,235
Past our prime? We're old and feeble.
Over the hill. We're nearly buried, boychick.

596
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,829
Listen. Fighting it's,
it is a young man's game.

597
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,340
You need someone with a little more
'oomph' to his swim

598
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,536
if you know what I'm talking about.

599
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,647
Somebody more robust
and sportin' like Thornton.

600
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,840
Thornton?
What about Thornton?

601
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,247
That's it,
Someone more like Thornton

602
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:20,346
Thorton? Agh. Well,
What've I gotta lose!

603
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,923
Did I ever tell you boys
about the time I freed Willy?

604
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,429
Aye, caramba.

605
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,430
Now there's one minor change
I want to make to the act

606
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,133
There will be no further references
to my rear end.

607
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,540
That's my complex.

608
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,842
You will cease comparing
its size and appearance to

609
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:49,351
A) a tugboat, B) the planet Jupiter,
or C)...

610
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,148
Mr. Thornton!

611
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,051
Oh? You are a little early
for the show, my boy.

612
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,021
My girl's engaged to a shark!

613
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,222
SHARK?! Shark!
Where? Where?!

614
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,829
My girl's engaged to a shark!

615
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,829
You're girls engaged to a shark.

616
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,434
Shocking.
Absolutely shocking.

617
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,229
He's gonna take
Cordelia away.

618
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,234
I need your help.
Will you fight him?

619
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:13,241
You want me to fight a shark?
You've come unhinged, lad.

620
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,640
I thought you fought a sea monster
as big as an oil tanker.

621
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:20,547
- Who said that?
- You did. Last night.

622
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:24,051
I did? Oh, yes that's
right, I did.

623
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,716
Yes, but you see, that doesn't count,
because I said it in rhyme.

624
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,228
That's what we call
poetic al license.

625
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,033
You mean you lied.

626
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,932
Well, I, I... I may have
exaggerated for dramatic effect.

627
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,030
But... And anyway, I, I'm sure

628
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,838
I said it was more the size
of a... kayak.

629
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,244
Thanks for nothing.

630
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,248
Don't worry lad,
There's plenty more fish in the sea.

631
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,946
- Well, would you fight a shark?
- You're nothing but a fat booty!

632
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:13,831
All right, I got the most
beautiful girl on the Reef.

633
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,838
Now I've just gotta find
the most beautiful pearl.

634
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,137
But Troy, finding something
like that could take months.

635
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,543
Yeah, If we were morons!

636
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,344
Who's got the best one
on the reef?

637
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,750
Hey... Nerissa.
He has a blue pearl.

638
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,651
It's the only one on the Reef, see?

639
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,727
Perfect. Go get it, and bring it back.
Problem solved.

640
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,628
They say he's kind'a tough,
this Nerissa

641
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,826
Are you tellin' me that
you are not tougher than a ta too... turtle?

642
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,531
Are you an idiot?
Are you?

643
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,641
Well... I...

644
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,243
Who can part the sea
like Charlton Heston?

645
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,140
Troy!

646
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,646
Who's tougher than you all,
even when he's just restin?

647
00:41:58,782 --> 00:41:59,441
Troy!

648
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:03,542
Who's gonna do what I say,
or find themselves in my large intestine?

649
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,752
- Us.
- That's right!

650
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,823
What am I gonna do?

651
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,122
PI!

652
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,632
I'm not worthy.
I'm not worthy!

653
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,029
Dylan, what are you doing?

654
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:22,229
Dude, you are my idol!
Dude, don't play dumb with me, man.

655
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,433
You didn't come home last night
from your hot date with Cordelia.

656
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,136
But don't worry,
I got ya covered with mom.

657
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,042
So... details, please.

658
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,741
I got beat up by Troy and
Cordelia agreed to accept his Pearl.

659
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,441
What?

660
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:38,646
She agreed to accept Troy's pearl
if he stopped pummeling my head.

661
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,519
- So, the date didn't go well?
- Not exactly...

662
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,219
DUCK!

663
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,130
I don't feel good about this.

664
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,731
- Dude, what the?
- Shhhh!

665
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,724
Everyone says that old turtle is a wizard.

666
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,338
They say that old shipwreck
he lives in is haunted with ghosts.

667
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,532
It sounds spooky.

668
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,737
You know what you are?
You're a disgrace to vicious predators! See?

669
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,544
If Troy tells us to go steal Nerissa's pearl
then we go steal Nerissa's pearl.

670
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,346
Okay, I'll do it.

671
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,852
Okay, Magellan, Which way is
that stupid shipwreck?

672
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,516
- I think it's that way.
- Wrong way dummy!

673
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,822
- That was close, dude.
- Come on, we gotta warn Nerissa.

674
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,123
Dude...

675
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,733
Oh... fish... Dude!

676
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,736
- Dude!
- Nerissa!

677
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,130
Nerissa!

678
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,934
Oh well, no one's home.
We tried Bye bye!

679
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,638
Nerissa!

680
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,840
Dude, nobody's here. And if they are
they don't wanna be disturbed.

681
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,042
Let's just go.

682
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,243
Oh-oh...

683
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,854
Well. Look who's here.

684
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,354
Oh God, no!

685
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,218
Let go of me!

686
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,126
All right, stupid!
First we get them, then the pearl.

687
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,335
- Dylan!
- We're coming for you, chum!

688
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,943
Hey! They're down there!
Come on!

689
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,438
But, Bart!

690
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,451
- I don't like this...
- Stop your whining.

691
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,453
Come on! Let's go! Let's go.
We gotta go

692
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,453
No! We can't let them
get Nerissa's pearl.

693
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,717
- I'm just, just...
- Don't freak out on me!

694
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,224
I'll figure something out.

695
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:31,528
- Hey, what's that?
- It's... I don't know...

696
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,545
- Not bad. Not bad at all...
- Pardon?

697
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:55,515
You're got more nerve
than I thought.

698
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,026
Maybe I can do something about
with your little problem with Troy.

699
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,928
Be here tomorrow, sunrise,
begin your training.

700
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,627
My what? My training?

701
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,930
Dude, you're going to teach Pi
how to fight Troy?

702
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,939
I'm going to teach the Kid
how to defeat Troy.

703
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,441
Sunrise!
Not one second later

704
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,945
- Cool!
- Dude!

705
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,042
Pi!

706
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,552
I can't let you go.

707
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,950
I've heard from
the ethereal netherworld,

708
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:29,219
and they think this is
an incredibly stupid idea.

709
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,318
You said I'd find my destiny
on the Reef. Well I did.

710
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,228
And I'm about to lose her,
just like I lost my parents.

711
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,334
I couldn't do anything to save them,
and maybe I can't save Cordelia.

712
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,937
And maybe I can't save Cordelia.

713
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,231
But Aunt Pearl...
I've got to try.

714
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,951
I'm gonna regret this...

715
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,347
All right, Kid,

716
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,352
We're gonna take a trip
through the Canyon.

717
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,923
And if you can keep up
and if you're still in one piece at the end

718
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,719
then we'll go on.

719
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,023
If not, I'll send what's left
of you home in a doggy bag.

720
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,927
- I can keep up.
- We'll see about that, kid.

721
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,535
This is nothing!
I can go twice as fast as this!

722
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,338
It isn't what you can do on
the straightaway,

723
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,344
Kid. It's the turns that'll get ya.

724
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:33,049
The Reef isn'tjust a pretty place to sightsee,
it can be your best weapon.

725
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,819
But to use it against your opponent,
you've gotta master it yourself!

726
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,021
Elkhorn coral. Razor sharp.

727
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,725
If you're lucky, it'll just
scrape off a patch of skin.

728
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,335
If you're unlucky, you'll get
to see your own skeleton.

729
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:52,035
Fire coral. One touch and it can burn
a hole right through your fin.

730
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,742
This section of the canyon is
called Bottleneck Alley.

731
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,148
Some folks find a dark,
enclosed space disorienting.

732
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,622
Plus, there's lots of rocks
for them to bump their head on.

733
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,325
Remember this place, kid.
I will ask questions later.

734
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:16,728
See you tomorrow,
same time, same place.

735
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:25,335
If we get the crazy lady's pearl,
maybe Troy will forgive us.

736
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,739
For what happened at the wreck?
He already has.

737
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,143
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I told him it was your fault.

738
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,944
What? That isn't true!

739
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,645
- What's your point?
- You are a liar!

740
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,621
Of course I lied.
I'm an evil henchman.

741
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,225
I am an evil henchman also!

742
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,228
- You're not evil.
- I am so!

743
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,424
If you were evil,
you wouldn't care about me lying.

744
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,627
You think I'd care
if you told lies about me?

745
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,136
I wouldn't tell lies about you!

746
00:47:56,273 --> 00:48:00,232
Exactly.
Because you're not evil!

747
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,642
I'm kaida evil.

748
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,650
All right, so you're pretty fast
and agile for a fish. I'll give you that.

749
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,947
But still I'm tiny,
compared to Troy.

750
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,216
Yeah, and Troy's tiny
compared to the sea.

751
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,724
You learn to make the ocean work for ya,
and size won't matter.

752
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,422
You get water dense enough,
and it becomes a weapon.

753
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:27,226
What are you doing?

754
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:39,640
Please! Help! Nerissa!

755
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,843
- Ladies and gentleman. Place your bets!
- Help! Nerissa!

756
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,951
No! Wha... Please!
I'm gonna be sick!

757
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,924
A fish getting' sea sick.
Now I've seen everything!

758
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,222
No barfing on the poop deck.

759
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:59,625
Yes, yes, yes!
I want her to wear it up.

760
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,332
WAY UP for her
next photo spread! That is supreme.

761
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,840
Now tease it.
Tease it! TEASE IT!

762
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,140
You're squeezing it! I said tease it!
Don't get huffy with me crab face.

763
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,044
I scratch your eyes out.

764
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:17,347
Ach do leber.
This is so you. I just LUV it!

765
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:21,619
Please, sea shells
were so last year.

766
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,424
The shells are fine...

767
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,519
Oh honey,
you look so beautiful...

768
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,632
No, babe,

769
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:34,328
don't look so glum I wish
I had two boys fighting over me.

770
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,938
What are you
talking about?

771
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,339
Max...
what's he talking about?

772
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,038
Darling, you have
enough on your mind.

773
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,649
I don't want you
worrying about some riffraff Romeo.

774
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,446
- The girl has got a right to know.
- I second that...

775
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:53,818
Well, your admirer.
The red one with the cute white stripe.

776
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,015
You mean Pi?

777
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,626
He's been working out with
that crazy old wizard turtle

778
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,820
learning how to fight
so he can beat up Troy when he comes.

779
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,123
No!

780
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,034
I hope it wasn't anything I said.

781
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,830
I don't like fighting.
I like loving.

782
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:12,638
Eddie's not evil...
Eddie's not evil!

783
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:17,236
Shut up!
I am so! See! I said shut up!

784
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,440
That's not evil.
That's just rude.

785
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:24,452
Well my mom always said,
rudeness is the root of all evil.

786
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,820
I win! Evil henchmen don't talk
about their mothers!

787
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,925
No...

788
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,931
All right, play time is over.

789
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,432
I've shown you ways
to confuse and trap your opponent.

790
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:42,434
But you must train yourself to move
and react faster than him.

791
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,039
Let's see what you can do.

792
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,937
Swim the obstacle course
as fast as you can.

793
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,338
Go!

794
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,837
Swim like you life
defended on it!

795
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,839
Cause itjust might.

796
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,552
Come on!
Put some fish oil into it!

797
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:59,052
All right, now,
off the mast!

798
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,623
Over the sail!

799
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,326
Watch out!

800
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,828
I guess I should have
explained myself.

801
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,836
The idea of an obstacle course
is to avoid the obstacles.

802
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,037
Now, if the idea was
to demolish my home with your face,

803
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,235
you'd be doing great.
Try it again.

804
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,744
- But
- And this time, do it fast!

805
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,741
Do it fast?

806
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,543
Go!

807
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,654
- Pi!
- Cordelia!

808
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,621
I can't let you do it, Pi.

809
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,125
I make my own decisions,
and I've chosen Troy.

810
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,319
Because you love him?

811
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,227
He promised to leave you alone
and the Reef alone!

812
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:46,131
- Do you really believe he'll keep his promise?
- I have to believe it.

813
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:54,835
If you can believe in him...
then why can't you believe in me?

814
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,746
Did you hear about the kid
who's gonna fight Troy?

815
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,853
Like we don't have
enough problems with Troy.

816
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,116
This is only gonna make him madder.

817
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,225
Huh?

818
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,817
Exactly! And who's he gonna
take it out on? Us!

819
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,022
Well, maybe after he eats the kid
he'll feel too bloated

820
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,030
and lethargic to chase anybody else.

821
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,330
Good point! You shouldn't swim
for at least half an hour after eating,

822
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,735
so maybe he'll get a cramp
and we can all hide.

823
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:33,841
Spirit of the Sea?
It's Pearl calling.

824
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,250
You know, it's too much to ask
that he actually be able to win.

825
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:40,049
But please...

826
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,923
if everyone who loves Pi could
just be there for him when the time comes...

827
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,121
Well, I'd really owe you one.

828
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,432
Percy... I had the strangest dream.

829
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:56,334
Me too,

830
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,838
Was it about Pi?

831
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,432
Yes. I have the feeling
something awful is about to happen...

832
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,739
- Not evil.
- I am so evil!

833
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,247
Not evil. I win!

834
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,626
Eddie... I am your father.
Join me!

835
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,024
Oh wait, you're not evil enough.

836
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:24,725
Stop Now!
You know it gives me the willies!

837
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,632
Evil henchmen don't
get the willies.

838
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,534
They give the willies.

839
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,233
You don't have one evil scale
all over you!

840
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:36,539
Yes, we're all very scaled down here,
but must you be so loud?

841
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,847
See? I am evil.

842
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,952
Let go get that pearl!

843
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,720
Nerissa? How come you
live in that old wreck?

844
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,417
Why don't you live on the Reef
with everyone else?

845
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,926
What are you, a priest?

846
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,021
Well, uh... no.

847
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,827
Good! 'cause I don't remember
goin' to confession.

848
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:02,530
Now listen up... You think you're fast,
and maybe you are. But so is Troy.

849
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,331
I know.

850
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,941
But the ocean's faster
than both of you.

851
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,236
Come on.

852
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,947
This is the West Indies Current.

853
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,746
Come on!

854
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,722
This is great!
Why don't all fish do this?

855
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,521
Because we're not the only one's
using the current.

856
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,129
Portuguese Man O'war.

857
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,732
One of the deadliest
creatures in the ocean.

858
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,035
One of the deadliest creatures
in the ocean.

859
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,332
Notice the tentacles?
Almost transparent;

860
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:40,034
easy to swim right into 'em. One touch,
and a big fish is paralyzed.

861
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,441
One touch,
and a fish your size is dead.

862
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,738
DEAD!

863
00:54:55,959 --> 00:55:00,328
- What happened?
- Someone broke in and stole Mom's pearl.

864
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,727
This is a bad omen, dude.

865
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,629
Stop it, Dylan! There's nothing
mystical about this, Honestly,

866
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,830
I don't know where you get that from.
We just got robbed, kids.

867
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,033
We just got robbed, kids.

868
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:15,337
It happens.
Even in the nicest neighborhoods.

869
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:21,849
I'm a... I'm just a,
going to clean up down here is all.

870
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,350
Good night.

871
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:31,022
It's a sign.
It's a terrible sign.

872
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,129
My dad gave her that pearl.

873
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,932
Hey, Dude.
Forget all this, huh?

874
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,230
We'll run away and find your friend Percy.
We'll migrate with the dolphins.

875
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,736
- Porpoises.
- Whatever.

876
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,137
I wish we could, Dyl.
But I made a promise.

877
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:50,337
To who? Cordelia? Dude,
she doesn't even want you to fight Troy.

878
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,644
Maybe not. But if I break my word,
she'll have to go off with Troy,

879
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,652
and I'll have to live with that.

880
00:55:56,786 --> 00:56:01,917
Pi, I take back what I said before.
You're 100% non-dork.

881
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,027
Oh, Dude. Sorry. Now that was
the uncoolest thing I've ever done.

882
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,427
It's o-

883
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:13,730
And you're 99% feeb-free.

884
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:33,551
What's that Captain? How am I supposed
to now what's wrong with him?

885
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:38,627
Maybe he's one of those farm fresh fish
or something? Genetic malcontents.

886
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,428
Look, this is stupid!

887
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,035
I thought you were gonna teach me
how to fight like you.

888
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,535
I don't stand a chance.

889
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,532
NO!

890
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:52,241
Hey! Get away from there!

891
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,037
Don't ever touch it again!
Do you understand?

892
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:58,636
I'm... I'm sorry!
What's the big deal?

893
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,848
It's the pearl I gave my wife.
And it's all I have left of her.

894
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,455
Used to be, folks stuck together.

895
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,421
Then they put
in the Wildlife Sanctuary,

896
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,720
and everybody forgot what
it was like to be hunted.

897
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,926
When my wife got hooked out
on Flatbottom,

898
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,727
I begged for help.

899
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,928
But nobody came,
they all hid on the Reef, where it's safe.

900
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,234
I'm sorry.

901
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,832
Listen, Kid, I never told you
I'd teach you how to fight the shark.

902
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,138
I never would,
cause you'd never win.

903
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,738
- Then what...
- I told you I'd teach you how to defeat him.

904
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,249
- But how?
- With your brain.

905
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,355
What's stronger than Troy?

906
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,923
- Bigger? Faster.
- The sea.

907
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,618
But what's to stop him
from using them against me?

908
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:48,026
Troy always picks on folks
who are smaller and weaker.

909
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:51,429
He has never had to learn about things
bigger than himself.

910
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:56,028
I understand how to use all this stuff
to avoid Troy, but how do I defeat him?

911
00:57:56,172 --> 00:58:00,233
You offer something he wants,
and then give him something he doesn't want.

912
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,435
You're shark bait, kid, like it or not.

913
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,046
And the Reef's the hook.

914
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:15,615
- Hey! Boychik!
- Hey, Moe.

915
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,022
You look limper than a slice of lox.

916
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,527
I guess he's being pretty tough
on you, huh?

917
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,826
Yeah, he was always like that,
to build a higher.

918
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,231
- You know him?
- Nerissa? Oh sure.

919
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:29,634
We were all of us pretty close,
back before his... uh Well.

920
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,940
That's a long story.
You better go back to bed, boychik.

921
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:38,445
If I know that old turtle,
tomorrow's only gonna be worse.

922
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,745
Listen, Pi. If you get a chance,
you tell Nerissa...

923
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,946
You, you, you tell
him Moe says Hi.

924
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,922
And... uh... that I'm sorry.

925
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:05,236
Well, it's my last day
of training.

926
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:11,837
Oh, Pi... I... I see a great destiny
for you, my darling.

927
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,142
Really, are you just making that up?

928
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,048
What are you kidding me?
I could lose my license.

929
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,451
You're talking to someone
that read the fin of the con-father.

930
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:25,927
I'm telling ya,
I see love, honesty, courage.

931
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:33,225
You're destined for great things.
And don't you forget it, mister.

932
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:50,443
Pretty good, kid.
But we still got some work to do.

933
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,132
Un-fishin' believable.

934
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:08,135
What's that captain? Huh? Heh!
The Captain is embarrassed for you.

935
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,829
And he doesn't even exist.

936
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,942
You can tell the Captain
I get the POINT!

937
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,351
- You're ready.
- I am?

938
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:30,221
Well, you better be.

939
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:38,723
TROY! TROY! TROY!

940
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,331
I just want to thank everyone here
for coming to my bachelor party.

941
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,739
I feel like the luckiest shark
in the whole world.

942
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,539
I never though you would be
the first one to go, squirt!

943
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,638
What's the old ball
and chain for the little shrimp?

944
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,150
It'll never last...

945
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:02,317
Man, I love you dudes!

946
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,722
You know I got the hottest babe
on the reef

947
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,726
but more importantly,

948
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:09,024
I got the best buds that the shark
could ever have!

949
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,429
Who's goina'
have a good time tonight,

950
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,627
before the old ball
and chain takes away his bite?

951
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,432
TROY!

952
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:31,942
- Beautiful huh?
- Cordelia!?

953
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,146
What are you doing here?

954
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,018
I like to come up here...

955
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,626
because it reminds me of you.

956
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,925
You need to make a wish.

957
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,741
What'd ya wish for?

958
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,438
That you come to your senses
before tomorrow...

959
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,023
SSSSSSShark!

960
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,740
- Where's Pi?
- Now you show up?

961
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:32,246
Model schmodel.
That brave boy has left already

962
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:34,849
No! I've got to stop him!

963
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:36,952
Cordelia, wait!

964
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,350
We should have stopped Troy
a long time ago,

965
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,013
but we were all too scared.

966
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,215
Well I won't let Pi throw his life away

967
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,223
standing up for fish
who won"t even stand up for themselves!

968
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,328
Who decides if it's life or it's death?

969
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,036
Who can eat a whole
school of salmon

970
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:07,548
and still have minty fresh breath?

971
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:08,342
Troy!

972
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:11,453
Who ain't afraid of
no fishin' pole?

973
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:14,112
Who makes the babes
all lose control?

974
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,919
Who can't be flushed down
no toilet bowl?

975
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:17,718
Troy!

976
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,229
Well, well, well.
Chicken of the sea.

977
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:26,131
Troy. If you want to take Cordelia,
you'll have to go through me first.

978
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,432
It'll be my pleasure, chum.

979
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:33,736
You guys stay back.
Cause this one's mine...

980
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,248
You're just prolonging the agony!

981
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,947
Actually,
I'm postponing the agony!

982
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,024
What's a matter, Troy?
Can't keep up with a piece of chum?

983
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,027
You are so dead!

984
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,530
You gotta catch me first!

985
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,536
Here I come!

986
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,942
Elkhorn coral!
Razor sharp!

987
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,216
Fire coral.
Wouldn't wanna touch that!

988
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,025
Oh-oh,
tight squeeze up ahead!

989
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,836
No, no, no, no.

990
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,849
Stop, stop. Stop,
please stop, stop the spinning!

991
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,819
I'm gonna hurl!

992
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,321
A sea-sick shark.

993
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,518
A sea-sick shark.
Now I've seen everything.

994
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,822
Welcome to Bottle neck alley!

995
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:12,029
No, no!

996
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,642
Troy, I can't beat you in a fight.

997
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,244
But I can certainly out think you.

998
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:20,440
Help me! Help me!
Guys, help me!

999
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,349
Please!
I'm endangered species!

1000
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,055
Cheese!

1001
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,225
Come on guys!
Yeah, yeah, that's good!

1002
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,527
No!

1003
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,242
Yeah, Out of reef
and out of luck, buddy.

1004
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,527
I got you now!

1005
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,932
Get him! You idiots!

1006
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,934
We're coming for you, chum!

1007
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,446
Time you boys got the boots!

1008
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,420
- Wait!
- No, What do you want?

1009
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:37,219
You took my mom's pearl.
Give it back.

1010
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,419
Chunky boy here wants to fight?

1011
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,722
Give it back!

1012
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,825
Wait!

1013
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:45,925
Bart, I'm scared!

1014
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:49,526
What I say about going into my hole!
What I say! It's my hole!

1015
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,934
You don't pay to press,
here coming pitching!

1016
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,441
Wait! Stop! I'm sorry! Oh my...

1017
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:56,937
Hey, Troy.

1018
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,140
Nobody makes those idiots
look like idiots except me!

1019
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,619
Ready to go for
a big ride, Troy?

1020
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,222
Portuguese Man O'war.

1021
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,834
Watch out for the tentacles?

1022
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,437
No!

1023
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:45,823
Pi!

1024
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,326
Stay back, guys!

1025
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,129
Be careful!

1026
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,737
Kid! You all right?

1027
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,542
Nerissa!

1028
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,748
Ah, yeah. Nerissa.

1029
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,914
I was wondering where
that little squirt picked up all his moves.

1030
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:17,616
Too bad pops.

1031
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,422
Looks like you didn't
live up to your legend.

1032
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,134
- Come on!
- Oh no...

1033
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,830
Here, here! Told ya.
They hate this!

1034
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,033
Ay caramba.

1035
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,045
- You gotta get out of here!
- No!

1036
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,147
Keep your distance, tiburon,

1037
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,252
or we'll chop you into ceviche!

1038
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,148
What do you think you're doing?

1039
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,517
Helping out an old friend!

1040
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,124
Like we should have done
a long time ago!

1041
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:51,726
Oh you bad fish, come back!

1042
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,227
Come back!
Come back right now!

1043
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:55,728
Let's go!

1044
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,526
Yes!

1045
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,536
Move it! Ha!
I got you now, chum!

1046
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,433
Pull him up!
Pull him up!

1047
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,038
What the?

1048
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,437
Have AT you, varlet!

1049
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,741
Thou fusty fat-kidneyed flirt-gill!

1050
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,723
I'm largely blubber!

1051
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:26,225
My rear end alone contains
a fatal dose of cholesterol!

1052
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,131
He SHOOTS! He SCORES!

1053
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,027
I can't move it!

1054
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,931
Perhaps we can move it together, dear.

1055
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,229
Mum!

1056
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,334
Pants, I was robbed.

1057
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,639
Ref I want instant replay.
Right now.

1058
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,247
Percy...!

1059
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,120
- The net!
- Pi... no!

1060
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,418
Don't do this, dude.

1061
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,429
It's the only way!

1062
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,828
Pi! Be careful!

1063
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,629
Troy! This is between us!

1064
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,739
Well, maybe a little squirt like you
can hide on the Reef,

1065
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,932
but we're in open water now.

1066
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:16,135
There's no way
you can outrun me here.

1067
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,246
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

1068
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,021
You're dead!

1069
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,327
What the...

1070
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:40,730
Got you!

1071
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,034
If I'm going,
I'm gonna take you with me.

1072
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,333
I don't think so!

1073
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,518
Help!

1074
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,629
Help, guys, please!

1075
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,850
Who's the shark who's mean and rotten,

1076
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:32,442
and going to be served
with potatoes au gratin?

1077
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,247
Troy!

1078
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,914
Who's gonna find himself
coated in batter,

1079
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,821
featured on a Seafood Sampler Platter?

1080
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,723
Troy!

1081
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,922
That was a fairly insane thing
you just all did.

1082
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,830
Well, you know. We thought maybe you
and the boychik could use a little help.

1083
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,632
Anything for an old amigo.

1084
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:55,335
Oh, Dylan! My baby.
Oh, I'm so proud!

1085
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,445
Mom, l...

1086
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,347
Excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

1087
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:07,613
Oh, no. That belongs to
my awesome mother.

1088
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,027
Why, thank you... Doctor.

1089
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,528
- Thank you, Nerissa.
- You can keep your thanks.

1090
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,637
And you can take this off my hands.

1091
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,831
But... This belongs to you.

1092
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,341
A long time ago, I gave it
to the girl of my dreams.

1093
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,639
We would've passed it on to our son,
if we'd had one...

1094
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,943
And if he's turned out like you.

1095
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,847
I don't know what to say.

1096
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:41,422
You know what to say.
I'm just not the one you need to say it to.

1097
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:54,425
- Cordelia...
- Oh, Pi...

1098
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,738
That sweetest thing ever!

1099
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,636
I do believe in you.

1100
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,037
Cordelia.

1101
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,450
They're kissing!

1102
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,418
- Why?
- Come on! Let's go!

1103
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,527
The townsfolk said 'Pi,
you can't possibly win! '

1104
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,726
He'll swallow your head
and pick his teeth with your fin!

1105
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:06,432
But Pi was determined,
he refused to despair.

1106
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,337
I know it's all true For you see...

1107
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:14,142
I was there!
