1
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,486
- You're cute.
- I love you.

2
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,991
Spring break!

3
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,028
Hey!

4
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,129
Whoo!

5
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,231
Awesome!

6
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,734
Gross.

7
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,170
- Greg!
- Here you go, girl.

8
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,773
Cheers.

9
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,843
Best night ever!

10
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,811
Whoo, Milly!

11
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,551
Oh, my... No, come on!

12
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,588
I can't. I can't.

13
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,026
- Yeah!
- Oh, my...

14
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,661
Oh, my God!

15
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,598
Whoa, no! Oh! Milly! Milly, no!

16
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,334
- Tom! Help!
- I can't do shit.

17
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,836
Nat! Nat!
Nat! Nat!

18
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,105
Nat, Nat, Nat, Nat, Nat!

19
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:13,586
Work it! Work it girls!
Work it, girl!

20
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,123
- Take a pic... Take a picture!
- And me!

21
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:19,026
Hey! Spring break! Whoo!

22
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,161
Come on!

23
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,297
- Yeah, I could dance.
- You know you wanna dance.

24
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,951
Okay, worst hangover ever.

25
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,752
I mean, easy, that's tomorrow.

26
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,056
Best hangover cure?

27
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,658
Um, pancakes and syrup?

28
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,061
Easy, it's tequila.

29
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,262
Tequila!

30
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,965
- To friends!
- To amigos!

31
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,267
Salud!

32
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,838
Aghh!

33
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,282
Let me help you out there,
baby girl.

34
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,975
Alright, line 'em up.

35
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,144
Bad news.

36
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,213
- Time to play spin the bottle?
- Yeah!

37
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,915
Okay, and then, and then
the loser has to go to the bar.

38
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,383
- Yeah!
- Yeah, alright, okay!

39
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,751
Whoa...!

40
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,789
- Of course!
- Loser!

41
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,060
- Okay, beers? Beers, beers?
- Beers!

42
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,295
And don't forget the tequila!

43
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,871
She better not come back
with water.

44
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,039
Oh, you know she's gonna
drink water.

45
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,975
That's Nat in a nutshell.

46
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,705
Hi, Mom and Billy!

47
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,741
I just wanna say
I really miss you guys.

48
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,443
Can't wait to see you.

49
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,380
<i>Por favor.</i>

50
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,248
Sure.

51
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:25,052
Let me see. Uh, one second.

52
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,122
- There.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

53
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,024
Uh, can I get you something
to eat?

54
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,358
<i>Quieres comer?</i>

55
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:35,062
<i>No, gracias. Cigarillo?</i>

56
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,998
Oh, no. No, thank you. No <i>fumo.</i>

57
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:40,935
Uh, <i>donde estan tus amigos?</i>

58
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:45,206
Uh, my friends, uh,
they're on the beach. Partying.

59
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,474
Ah.

60
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,977
Hmm. <i>Tiburon.</i>

61
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,113
<i>Gran Tiburon Blanco.</i>

62
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,987
Hey, Nat. Who's your new friend?

63
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,754
- Are you gonna introduce us?
- Uh...

64
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,092
<i>- Tiburon.</i>
- T-tibur... what dude?

65
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,228
I think that's how
he must've lost his legs.

66
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,230
It's a good thing
we're out of here tomorrow.

67
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,331
Tyler!

68
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,866
<i>Escuchame. No estoy mintiendo.</i>

69
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,435
- Whoa. Uh...
- Oh, geez.

70
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,937
<i>- No estoy mintiendo.</i>
- Dude's loco.

71
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:18,806
- And in serious need of a bath.

72
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,043
<i>- Cuidado.</i>

73
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:26,814
- Hey, dude. Hands to yourself.
<i>- Cuidado. Cuidado.</i>

74
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,449
<i>- Cuidado.</i>
- "Watch out."

75
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,985
<i>- Cuidado.</i>
- He told me to watch out.

76
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,987
It's fine.

77
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,163
Ooh! It's warm!

78
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,498
Ooh! So nice!

79
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,533
- I don't wanna go home.
- Me neither.

80
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,503
Oh, man! I almost slipped
in the water!

81
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,138
What are you guys doing?!

82
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,274
- What are you doing?!
- What the fuck are you doing?

83
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,809
Get the fuck over here!

84
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,816
Hey!

85
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,853
It's our last spring break.

86
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,554
Nat!

87
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,197
<i>Vamos a la playa,</i> homies!

88
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,509
Hey! Let's get this show
back on the road.

89
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,078
<i>Nada mas.</i> I need to sleep.

90
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,213
No, honey. Come
six o'clock this evening,

91
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,183
our asses are on a plane
back to Kansas.

92
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,320
And that's it. <i>Adios.</i>

93
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,890
Plea-ease! When we're back
home, you can sleep for, like,

94
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,193
the next 50 years for all
I care, but... right now,

95
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:50,230
you're gonna get that cute
little butt of yours into gear.

96
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:53,133
And we're gonna party!

97
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,102
Okay!

98
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,271
- Whoo!
- Wait up, boom, uh...

99
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,044
Whoo!

100
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,115
- Whoo! Loser!
- Yeah. Douche!

101
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,319
Hey.

102
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,955
Jet skis?

103
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,264
Guys! Look what we found!

104
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,999
Go, go, go!

105
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,571
Come on, get over here!

106
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,507
Ride or die, motherfuckers!

107
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,309
Whoo!

108
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,978
Just break it, man.

109
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,448
This is such a bad idea,
you guys.

110
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,017
We're just borrowing
a couple of jet skis.

111
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,252
Still stealing!

112
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,287
Oh, my God,
keep taking those chill pills.

113
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,655
Spring break!

114
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,925
And our last chance
to do some dumb shit like this.

115
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,927
Well, I-I'm out of here,
you guys.

116
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,498
Oh, my God, you can
take a girl out of Kansas...

117
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,133
You were doing
a good impersonation

118
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,968
of someone who knew
how to enjoy herself.

119
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,004
Hey, Nat.
Something to tell the grandkids!

120
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,043
Alright!

121
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:16,950
Come on!

122
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,686
- Has he got the keys?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,664
- He has the keys?
- He got the keys, got the keys.

124
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,357
Are we actually doing this?

125
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,262
This is gonna be
fucking awesome.

126
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,098
Alright, come on!

127
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,168
30 bucks an hour, guys!
Who's paying?

128
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,404
Ha-ha, yes!
Gimme them bad boys.

129
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:38,605
- Okay.
- Hell yeah!

130
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,574
Hey...

131
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,278
- Hey!
- Whoa!

132
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,947
Hey, guys. Wait up!

133
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,551
- And we have lift off!
- Whoo!

134
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,553
Let's do it, Tyler!
- Yeah!

135
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,088
<i>- Vamos!</i>

136
00:10:56,056 --> 00:11:00,294
Whoo!

137
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,063
Where is he?

138
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,698
Tom, you're a douchebag!

139
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,303
- Is he al... Ah, hey!
- Hey! Whoo!

140
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,637
Asshole!

141
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,539
That's it dude,
I'm definitely driving.

142
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,775
Oh, yeah? Keys.

143
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,211
Hey, there's room
for a little one.

144
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,412
Hop on, honey!

145
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,447
Come on,
a quick five minute blast

146
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,316
and then we can get churros
for breakfast!

147
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,750
Churros!

148
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,652
Churros!

149
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,356
- Yes!
- Ahh! Yes!

150
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,193
- Woo!
- Are you on?

151
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,595
Yeah.

152
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,597
- Whoo!
- Do it!

153
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,806
Yeah!

154
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,773
Whoo!

155
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,319
- That's all you got?!
- Losers buy breakfast!

156
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,188
Let me show you, baby!

157
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,304
Yeah!

158
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,110
- Yeah!
- Go on!

159
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,145
- Come on!
- Go on!

160
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,482
We're going too far out!

161
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:32,152
Greg, I wanna go back to shore!

162
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,223
Greg, please!
Take me back to shore!

163
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,694
Come on! Yeah!

164
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,730
- Where are they going?!
- Jokers!

165
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,433
Go get 'em!

166
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:49,236
- Okay!
- What are you doing?!

167
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,771
- Slow down!
- Whoa!

168
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,840
Let's go!

169
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:54,541
Losers!

170
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:58,145
You wanna play chicken?!
Let's go! Come on!

171
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,746
- Greg, that's enough!
- Whoo-oh!

172
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,317
Yeah, let's go! Woo, woo!

173
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,721
Whoa!

174
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,759
Greg, that's enough.
This is wrong!

175
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,294
That was totally awesome!

176
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,163
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Let's go again!

177
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,564
Please take us back to shore!

178
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,132
Don't be a chicken.
Come on, man!

179
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,400
Yeah, come on!

180
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,768
- Whoo!
- Greg, no.

181
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:24,137
Who's the chickens here?
Come on!

182
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,345
My leg... My leg!

183
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,547
- Greg?!
- I fucked my fucking leg!

184
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,885
I'm coming!

185
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,890
I'm coming! Greg!

186
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,229
Help, Tom. I can't swim!

187
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,832
Tom!

188
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:30,203
You alright, Milly?

189
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,472
Milly, you alright?

190
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,441
Okay, stay there, I'm coming.

191
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,714
Don't worry, I got you.
Hold on to me. Okay?

192
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,619
Is it bad?

193
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:49,222
No, no.
Nothing we can't fix.

194
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,693
- What's that smell?
- Gas.

195
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,429
Fuel tank. Must've ruptured.

196
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,598
Tyler?! Where's Tyler?!

197
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,701
Tyler?! Where's Tyler?!

198
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,470
Tyler?!

199
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,974
Tyler?!

200
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,983
Fuck!

201
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,386
Dude!

202
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,622
Dude, dude. Come on. Dude!

203
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,966
Come on.

204
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,902
No, Greg, Greg, Greg,
Greg, Greg. No, please.

205
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,771
Okay, hold on.

206
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:39,573
- You need to talk to him!
- What?!

207
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,943
In case he has a head injury.
Ask him some questions!

208
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,311
- Dude, what's your name?
- Huh?

209
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,513
Your name, dude! Your name!

210
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,749
It's Tyler, you dumb shit.

211
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,618
- How long you known me for?
- He's good.

212
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay, dude. Come here.

213
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,804
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
One, two, three.

214
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:13,306
Alright, one, two, three...

215
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,884
Here!

216
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,389
Oh, God!

217
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,793
My cell!

218
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,029
You gotta keep still
or you're gonna tip us over.

219
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,035
You okay, bro?

220
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,538
It's working!

221
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,008
Oh, fuck. No signal.

222
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,876
- Fuck, fuck!
- Here, let me.

223
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,518
Son of a bitch, come on!

224
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,588
It's okay.

225
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,059
We'll be okay.

226
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,361
Hang on.

227
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,607
Oh, no, no. No, no.

228
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,810
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, no, no, no, no...

229
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,716
We need to get him to hospital.

230
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,552
You think you could take us
back to shore? Nice and steady?

231
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,055
What? Yeah, uh,
but how are we all gonna fit on?

232
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,957
There's only room
for three of us.

233
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,061
Let's get Greg to the hospital.

234
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:17,164
No. No, no, wait, hold on.
I can't swim properly!

235
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:19,066
- We'll come right back for you.
- What?!

236
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,002
The sea's calm
and the water's warm.

237
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:23,703
No. No, no, no way, sorry!

238
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,573
You can hold on to the other
jet ski if you have to.

239
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,975
We gotta get him back to shore.

240
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:30,011
Please. Please, I don't...
I don't wanna die.

241
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:33,214
Milly, Milly. We're good
right here. Okay? Right here.

242
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,850
Look.
Hold on to me if you have to.

243
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,154
- Alright?
- We need to do this. Right now.

244
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,026
Okay.

245
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,627
Okay.

246
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,964
Hey, breathe. Breathe.

247
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,043
- Hold on to me, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

248
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,744
- I got you.
- Alright. Okay.

249
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,716
You two cool?

250
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,551
It's a nice day for a swim, bro.

251
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,988
- Nat?
- Yeah, I got him.

252
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,792
Okay, yeah. Alright. Yeah.

253
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,499
- Shit!
- What?!

254
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,902
- God damn!
- Well, what is it?

255
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,502
It's dead!

256
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,042
- Motherfucker!
- Can you fix it?

257
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,744
I major in history. Tyler,
you know anything about engines?

258
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,746
I don't even know
where the engine is.

259
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,514
I can feel something.

260
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,260
- I... I think it's a clasp.
- Good work, dude.

261
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:46,153
We need to move him
so we can get under the seat.

262
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:49,556
We're gonna move you, okay?
Guys, we need help.

263
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,690
Come on.

264
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:54,895
- Okay, go.
- W-w-w-wait!

265
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,933
- Hold on to me, alright?
- Yeah.

266
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,800
- You gotta hold on.
- You got him?

267
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,669
- Hold on to us.
- Easy.

268
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,972
Slow. Slow, Greg. Slow.
Slow.

269
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,878
It's okay, it's okay, dude.

270
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,847
It's okay, dude.
We got you. We got you.

271
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,049
Let's do this. Quickly.

272
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,096
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,835
Can you see anything?

274
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,603
I don't know. Hang on.

275
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,875
How am I supposed
to get this thing off?

276
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,344
Uh... uh, is there a toolbox?

277
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:45,712
No. Fuck!

278
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,281
Alright, try starting it again.

279
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,055
We need to get him back up.

280
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,726
Pull me up!

281
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,829
Three, two, one...

282
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,141
<i>Animales.</i>

283
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,265
It's, like,
seven in the morning.

284
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,101
No one's out and about.

285
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:17,404
You got any other bright ideas?

286
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,273
I was just saying.

287
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,841
Well, don't.

288
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,210
Cos every time I listen to you,
I end up in trouble.

289
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,119
We're drifting out.

290
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,888
What?

291
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,324
There was a church tower on the
left and I can't see it anymore.

292
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:39,093
The tide must've changed.

293
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:43,097
We have to get signal
on Milly's cell.

294
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,399
- Tom?
- Shh, dude, someone's coming.

295
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,667
No... I'm so thirsty.

296
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:51,138
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

297
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,740
Greg, you can't drink the water.

298
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,309
- Please. Please.
- Dude, I'm sorry.

299
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:56,977
Okay.

300
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,813
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

301
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,748
- Okay.
- I'll get us out of here.

302
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,018
Okay. Okay.

303
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,387
"Can't stop thinking
about last night."

304
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,089
What?

305
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:10,858
"So hot."

306
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:17,464
Give me the phone.

307
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:19,266
No!

308
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:21,869
What are you doing?!

309
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,413
- What am I doing?!
- Give me the God damn phone!

310
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:24,939
- No!
- Give me the God damn phone!

311
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:26,440
- No! I...
- Shit!

312
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:29,310
- Look what you've done!
- What I've done?!

313
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:31,312
Yes, you!
- I trusted you!

314
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,480
- Nat, I was drunk!
- Cheaters!

315
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,854
- Asshole!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

316
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,290
You are such an asshole.

317
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,826
- Nat, I am sorry.
- Fuck you.

318
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,991
He's never gonna get it.

319
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,353
God, where is he?

320
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,996
- No! Whoa, whoa!
- What was that?

321
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,564
- Milly?!
- Shit.

322
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,303
Sorry.

323
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,905
You dragged me under!
You asshole!

324
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,277
Didn't think
I was gonna make it.

325
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,313
Here's the cell.

326
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,591
Asshole.

327
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,586
Natty, I'm so, so, so sorry.

328
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:28,956
I was so drunk.

329
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,358
So was he.

330
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,963
He said you two weren't
getting on and that's why...

331
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,202
That's why he what?

332
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,640
I may not be the only one.

333
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,442
Did anyone notice
that dude in the boat?

334
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:51,111
- What?
- We passed him on the way out.

335
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:54,014
He was on some kind of sailboat.

336
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,049
I don't think he was moving
very fast,

337
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,652
so he might still be out there
between us and the shore.

338
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,989
So why can't we see him?

339
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,658
I don't know. But I think
I'm gonna take my chance.

340
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:07,094
We have to stick together
till someone comes.

341
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,163
And what if no-one comes?

342
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:16,670
Look, I can ace this.
I can do this.

343
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,572
Tyler, no.
You took a bang to the head.

344
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:22,075
That might be a problem if there
was something inside of there.

345
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,212
You don't have to do this.

346
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:28,048
- Please.
- I reckon I do.

347
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,417
Thank you.

348
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,653
Here.

349
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:35,756
I got it when I was 14
at the Platte County Fair

350
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,491
from the guy running
the bumper cars.

351
00:27:38,592 --> 00:27:40,461
That all he gave you?

352
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,095
That's so cool.

353
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,600
Bro.

354
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,070
Kick ass.

355
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:53,240
Dude.

356
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:54,675
You got this.

357
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,448
Good luck, Tyler.

358
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,319
Y'all just hang tight now,
alright?

359
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:09,156
No partying when I'm gone.

360
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,795
- Go, Tyler!
- Whoo!

361
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,797
- Go on, Tyler!
- Go, Tyler!

362
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:19,700
- Go, Ty!
- Go, Tyler!

363
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,568
Whoo-ooh!

364
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,307
Shit.

365
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,776
Don't worry, he's gonna make it.

366
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,478
He's got this.

367
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:33,313
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:24,164
Fuck.

369
00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:27,434
Shark. Shark!

370
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,102
What?

371
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:31,438
Tyler! Shark!

372
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,076
- Tyler!
- Tyler!

373
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,683
Get out of the water, shark!

374
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,861
- Where did it go?
- Uh...

375
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:03,770
You sure it was a shark?

376
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:06,740
Shit, I don't know! What does
a shark even look like?!

377
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,211
Let me up!

378
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,570
Greg! Greg!

379
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:41,508
- I can't swim! Ah!
- Milly!

380
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,543
We need to get out the water!

381
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,614
Milly!

382
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,721
- I'm coming! Milly!
- Greg!

383
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:02,262
I felt something on my leg!

384
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,402
Milly! Come on!

385
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:09,904
Come on.

386
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:26,821
We need help! Somebody help!
Tom!

387
00:31:26,854 --> 00:31:28,823
Somebody help me!

388
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,933
Tom!

389
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,634
We need help!

390
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:44,872
Nat, stay there.
I'm coming.

391
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,912
Please, God.

392
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:56,984
Nat!

393
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:04,424
It's dragging both of you!
You have to let go!

394
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:09,229
Nat!

395
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,335
Nat!

396
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,918
- Nat!
- Oh, my God!

397
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,521
Oh, my God, come on, come on!

398
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,358
- Keep going, keep going!
- Keep swimming!

399
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:14,628
Come on, come on!
You can do it, you can do it!

400
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:18,398
Come on!

401
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,667
Grab my hand.

402
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,569
- Tom, help her.
- I got her.

403
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,707
I thought we lost you.

404
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,713
You're safe now, okay?

405
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:35,049
You're safe now.

406
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:38,085
Just breathe.

407
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,320
Nice and slow.

408
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,457
It's okay, Nat.

409
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,528
It's okay.

410
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:42,850
Is there any way that...

411
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:50,091
Greg, he maybe...

412
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:20,420
<i>Gran tiburon blanco.</i>

413
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:29,130
What?

414
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:35,669
The beggar... in the town.

415
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:41,775
He told me he had lost his legs
in a shark attack.

416
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:51,685
He said it was a great white.

417
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:44,238
Anything?

418
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:45,906
No.

419
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,816
What if no-one comes?

420
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,188
What if Tyler
can't find the boat?

421
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:03,124
Milly, shut up!

422
00:37:04,624 --> 00:37:07,594
The shark gets him
and then comes back for us.

423
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,296
Milly, shut the fuck up!

424
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:19,773
I'm such an asshole,
you're right.

425
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,213
How many others were there?

426
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:31,651
How many besides Milly?

427
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:42,029
Two.

428
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,331
I'm sorry.

429
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:58,212
My mom and dad got you down
as a stand-up guy.

430
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,016
Real son-in-law material.

431
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:05,186
And Billy, he hero worships you.

432
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:10,891
I mean, why are you even
still with me?

433
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:16,729
Huh?

434
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,201
Cos I love you.

435
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:23,070
Tom, the only person you love
is yourself.

436
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,041
Okay.
So, maybe you should start

437
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:29,243
trying to show yourself
some love.

438
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:32,079
And stop doing shit for people
and trying to please everyone.

439
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,746
It's called showing respect.

440
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,949
It's called being a doormat

441
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,984
and that's why people
walk all over you.

442
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:02,343
Hey!

443
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:04,078
Hey! Over here!

444
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,351
Hey! Right here!

445
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:18,691
Hey!

446
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:19,960
Hey!

447
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,198
No! No!

448
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,268
No, no. No...

449
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,455
Help! Shark! Help!

450
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,222
What time is it?

451
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,926
Nat? Time.

452
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:40,534
It's 3:15.

453
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:43,037
How long we been out here?

454
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:48,375
Tyler must've found the boat
by now.

455
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:55,549
Someone's gotta be
missing us? Right?

456
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,152
Someone cares?

457
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:10,397
I just wanna go home.

458
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,876
I hope you can forgive me.

459
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:47,101
I think I've found something.

460
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:02,583
I don't know
what I'm looking at.

461
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,025
Don't.

462
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,931
If you wanna feel even more
dehydrated, be my guest.

463
00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:28,409
Try, uh...

464
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,578
Try licking your lips.

465
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:27,267
It's 6:30.
It'll be dark soon.

466
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:31,472
Least we'll be out of the sun.

467
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,109
We were supposed
to be home by now.

468
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:45,118
The airline, they'll
know we're missing, right?

469
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,527
I don't wanna be
out here in the dark.

470
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,223
So cold.

471
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,562
What the fuck was that?

472
00:45:30,264 --> 00:45:31,765
I don't know.

473
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,806
Do sharks hunt at night?

474
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,477
I guess... it depends
if they're hungry or not.

475
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,312
This thing's fucking with us.

476
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:03,764
There's a light.

477
00:46:05,465 --> 00:46:06,700
Guys!

478
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:08,802
Is that a boat?!

479
00:46:10,203 --> 00:46:12,874
Guys, there's a light.
Over there!

480
00:46:12,907 --> 00:46:14,842
- Hello?!
- Hey!

481
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,677
Somebody?! Hey!

482
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,745
- Hey, over here!
- We're over here!

483
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,858
- What is it? What is it?
- That is a boat over there.

484
00:46:20,882 --> 00:46:22,316
- Hey! Dude!
- We're stuck!

485
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,251
- Hey!
- Over here!

486
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,487
- Over here!
- I don't think they can hear us.

487
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,556
Use the torch! The torch
on your cell phone

488
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,358
so they can see us in the dark!

489
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:33,126
Somebody, help. Please!

490
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,529
Hey, hey! Over here!

491
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:38,565
What are they doing?

492
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,367
Give me the phone.

493
00:46:41,234 --> 00:46:42,569
Hello?!

494
00:46:43,938 --> 00:46:45,339
- Hey!
- Hey!

495
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:46,773
- This way!
- Help!

496
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:50,243
- What are they waiting for?
- Don't know.

497
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:51,813
How far is it?

498
00:46:51,846 --> 00:46:53,780
50, maybe 60 yards.

499
00:46:53,815 --> 00:46:55,382
You think you can swim it?

500
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:00,354
What?

501
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,656
One of us is gonna have
to swim over to the boat.

502
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,829
You can do this.

503
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:41,989
I can't, I can't.

504
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:43,858
I can't. I'm sorry.

505
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:51,866
Sorry.

506
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:05,980
I'm sorry.

507
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:13,320
Nat?

508
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:15,923
You don't have to.

509
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:18,759
Nat.

510
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:25,867
You see anything...
move in the water...

511
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:30,270
you holler.

512
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:20,047
Are you okay?

513
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,818
What happened here?

514
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:43,436
- Nat!
- Nat!

515
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,704
- Nat!
- Hey!

516
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:46,140
We have to do something!

517
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:49,010
Do something!

518
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,718
Oh, fuck.

519
00:52:09,163 --> 00:52:10,998
It's only me!

520
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:12,766
It's only me, it's only me.

521
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,502
It's only me. Come on. Got you.

522
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:20,041
I got you.

523
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,679
We're almost there.
Nearly there.

524
00:52:31,052 --> 00:52:32,519
It's okay.

525
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,960
- Milly, come on, help.
- Give me your hand, here.

526
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:43,831
Did it bite you?

527
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:49,636
There was...

528
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:54,809
- Tell me.
- There was a man...

529
00:52:56,077 --> 00:52:57,812
in the water in a life vest.

530
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,580
He must've been a sailor.

531
00:53:00,613 --> 00:53:02,950
I think the shark
must've wrecked his boat

532
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:04,218
and killed him.

533
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:55,229
Oh, what is it?!

534
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:58,165
Oh, geez.

535
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,039
Holy fuck.

536
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:21,155
If we sit here and do nothing,
we're shark bait.

537
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:24,125
If we don't die of dehydration
first.

538
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:33,766
There's some driftwood.
You think we can reach it?

539
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:47,714
Got it! Got it.

540
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:50,683
For you.

541
00:55:50,717 --> 00:55:52,419
There's a life vest.

542
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:56,157
What if I fall in the water?
I can only do the doggy paddle.

543
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,128
Okay.

544
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,033
Now hold it right there.

545
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,434
Holy shit.

546
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,736
Who's doing this?

547
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,109
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

548
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,248
Thanks.

549
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,226
Are you sure it's this way?

550
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:15,329
Uh, I can't tell.

551
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:53,400
Come on, back there.

552
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:55,235
I'm exhausted.

553
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,872
God, I'm sorry.

554
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:02,276
Sorry's... not good enough.

555
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:04,144
Screw you, Nat.

556
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:08,115
Screw... you, Milly!

557
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:16,357
Where did it go?

558
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:32,272
Oh, shit!

559
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,449
Oh, God.

560
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:50,657
Nat got the motherfucker
real bad. Like, real bad.

561
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:52,559
So why would it even bother
coming back?

562
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:55,162
Cos now it's pissed
as well as hungry.

563
00:59:58,098 --> 00:59:59,566
We gotta get this thing started.

564
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,169
We all get up, real slow.

565
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:03,537
We already did that.

566
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,539
There's no way I'm going into
the God damn water.

567
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:08,342
We have to try.

568
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:10,377
How are we gonna do this?

569
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:16,450
You go the left,
I'll go to the right.

570
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:18,085
Hold on to each other,

571
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:19,987
keep ourselves
from falling into the sea.

572
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,489
Whoa, whoa! We have to go
at the same time. Okay?

573
01:00:22,523 --> 01:00:24,391
Yeah. Yeah.

574
01:00:26,226 --> 01:00:27,628
On the count of three.

575
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:30,097
One...

576
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,633
two, three.

577
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,276
I got you. I got you.

578
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:49,650
- Natty!
- You're good. You're good.

579
01:00:51,118 --> 01:00:53,153
Tom, you got this?

580
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:16,043
- You ready?
- Yeah.

581
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:17,578
Yeah, yeah.

582
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:24,051
Yeah.

583
01:01:25,252 --> 01:01:26,687
Further.

584
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:34,495
Now what?

585
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:37,397
We need to get that casing off
so we can get into the engine.

586
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:50,544
If I can get something
under it, I can work it loose.

587
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:54,248
We need to break it.

588
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:58,085
I'm in the wrong position.
Milly, you try.

589
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:00,320
Nat, grab the other side
and we'll pull together.

590
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:01,722
Oh, fuck.

591
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:04,091
Come on. Milly?

592
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:09,029
Nobody move.

593
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:12,466
Why?

594
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:20,641
What's it doing?

595
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,110
Circling us.

596
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,251
It's getting closer.

597
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:34,288
We have to get
the seat back down.

598
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:19,466
Milly! Milly!

599
01:03:19,499 --> 01:03:21,635
Tom!

600
01:03:21,668 --> 01:03:23,838
- Tom!
- Nat!

601
01:03:34,548 --> 01:03:36,818
Tom!

602
01:03:36,851 --> 01:03:38,285
Milly!

603
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:41,588
Help! No!

604
01:03:41,622 --> 01:03:43,690
Fuck!

605
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:46,760
Milly!

606
01:03:48,729 --> 01:03:51,465
Tom, I have to get you
to help me, okay?

607
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:52,799
Hold on!

608
01:03:52,834 --> 01:03:54,668
Hold on!

609
01:03:58,472 --> 01:03:59,706
Tom!

610
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:02,643
Milly!

611
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,444
Milly!

612
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:06,814
Milly!

613
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,290
Milly!

614
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,863
Come on, Milly!

615
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:23,196
Milly!

616
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:29,569
Come on!

617
01:04:29,603 --> 01:04:31,338
I've got you!

618
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,242
I've got you.

619
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:38,578
I got you.

620
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:40,280
Hold on. Hold on.

621
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:43,951
Milly!

622
01:06:24,986 --> 01:06:26,686
I'm a Kansas girl.

623
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,491
Go Kansas.

624
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:35,963
Kansas girls go down fighting.

625
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,002
Tom?

626
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:43,938
Tom?

627
01:06:46,439 --> 01:06:47,674
Tom?

628
01:06:51,979 --> 01:06:53,747
Stay with me, okay?

629
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:18,572
Tom?

630
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,344
Tom, uh, best linebacker?

631
01:07:25,179 --> 01:07:26,580
Huh?

632
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,749
Come on, Tom. Talk to me, Tom.
Best Chiefs linebacker?

633
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:34,956
Tom?!

634
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:36,991
Bobby Bell.

635
01:07:37,024 --> 01:07:40,560
Bell sucks.
Derrick Thomas all day!

636
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:48,970
Uh, best quarterback?

637
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:54,141
Come on, Tom. Best quarterback?

638
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:01,548
Shit.

639
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:03,717
I can't hear you, Tom.
Keep talking.

640
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,053
I'm thirsty.

641
01:08:06,087 --> 01:08:07,855
We'll be back in San Jose

642
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,024
drinking a cold cerveza
in no time.

643
01:08:35,016 --> 01:08:36,583
You can do this.

644
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,561
Nat!

645
01:09:21,594 --> 01:09:24,031
Nat! Nat!

646
01:09:36,776 --> 01:09:39,779
Nat. Nat...

647
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:04,071
Nat. Nat!

648
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:06,173
It's coming back!

649
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,709
It's coming back!

650
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,783
It's coming back!

651
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:18,551
Nat!

652
01:10:23,057 --> 01:10:25,126
Nat...

653
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:34,567
Nat?

654
01:11:27,388 --> 01:11:29,957
I thought you were dead.

655
01:11:41,368 --> 01:11:43,904
Still need to get the seat up.

656
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:54,808
Hold me. Not too tight.

657
01:13:10,824 --> 01:13:12,159
Please, God.

658
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:26,773
Hang on, Tom.

659
01:14:08,382 --> 01:14:12,186
Tom, I can see the shore!
We're almost there!

660
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:22,162
We're gonna make it!

661
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:36,443
Hold on!

662
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:48,022
Shit! We're taking in water.

663
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:55,529
I don't know if we have
the power to outrun it

664
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:57,131
and make it to shore.

665
01:14:57,865 --> 01:14:59,333
Come on!

666
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:06,206
Tom, we're sinking.

667
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,175
We're too heavy.

668
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,843
Can you see it?

669
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:12,246
Is it still following us?

670
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,986
Tell your folks and Billy

671
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,254
I really was a stand-up guy.

672
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:22,056
God!

673
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,995
- I love you.
- Tom!

674
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,232
Tom? Tom! No! Wait!

675
01:15:35,502 --> 01:15:37,905
- Get out of here.
- Hold on!

676
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,176
Shark. Shark!

677
01:15:45,446 --> 01:15:47,381
Tom, no!

678
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:49,316
Come on. Please!

679
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,251
I can't do this alone.

680
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:52,953
Just go.

681
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,358
You can still make it.
Come on!

682
01:15:59,326 --> 01:16:02,162
Come on, Tom. Please.

683
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:05,065
I'm sorry.

684
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,001
Tom!

685
01:16:08,035 --> 01:16:11,238
No!

686
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:50,304
Shit.

687
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:43,503
