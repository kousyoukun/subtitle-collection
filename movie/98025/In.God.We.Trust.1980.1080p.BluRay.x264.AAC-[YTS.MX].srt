- Hmm?

34
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:54,798
Good morning, God.
It's me, Ambrose.

35
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,094
Oops. Oh, dear

36
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:03,682
Sorry I'm a bit behind today,
but the rooster went off late.

37
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,685
Thank You for sparing me
for another day.

38
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:09,980
But, of course, that goes
without saying, doesn't it?

39
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,108
Except it doesn't, You see,
because in Your book,

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,945
it commands us to give
constant thanks day and night.

41
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:20,574
I can't imagine why You'd want
anyone to keep thanking You

42
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,076
for all eternity,
I mean, day and night.

43
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,996
I should-- I should think You'd
be bored with it by now.

44
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:29,541
I know I would.

45
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,960
I mean, it's not as if
You're insecure or anything,

46
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:35,339
or even as if You had
an identity problem.

47
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,007
I mean, after all,

48
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,676
You made me in Your
own image, didn't You?

49
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,014
I can't imagine You looking
like that somehow.

50
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,974
Still...

51
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:50,646
You made me on the
morning of the sixth day.

52
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:53,440
That was Saturday.

53
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,442
Well, You might have had
a rough Friday night.

54
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:56,652
Who knows?

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,074
Anyway, can't stand around
here talking.

56
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,617
You don't wanna hear
my problems.

57
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,952
I'm sure You've got
problems of Your own.

58
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:11,041
So, uh, I'll see
You tomorrow, eh?

59
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,542
I mean, I'll be here,

60
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,211
and, uh, well, I'll know
You'll be there.

61
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:18,298
If, um, I'm not here,
well, I'll be there.

62
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,634
By the way, uh, have
a nice day and amen.

63
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,594
Oof.

64
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,685
Oof.

( monks chanting )

78
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,328
- Oh, there you are, Ambrose.

79
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,538
Tell me something.

80
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,540
You are happy here,
aren't you?

81
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:41,209
Hmm?
You are happy.

82
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,628
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I forgot.

83
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,798
Yes, of course, you have my
permission to speak, of course.

84
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,050
- I think I'm happy, Father.
I don't know.

85
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,011
It's-- it's the only world
I've ever known.

86
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:54,681
- I think it's glorious at
your age and still celibate.

87
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:56,433
- I was celibate again last
night, Father.

88
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,559
- Good, who with?

89
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:00,312
- Myself, three times.

90
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:03,440
- Oh, careful.
Four would be pride.

91
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,233
- No. No,
I'm happy here, Father.

92
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:05,859
It's my-- it's my home.

93
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,695
- You never wished to visit
another world?

94
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,489
You-- you never think
you'd like to know

95
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,116
what's going on
outside these walls?

96
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:16,286
- Father, why-- why are you
asking me all this now?

97
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:20,165
- 'Cause we're sending you
on a mission, out there.

98
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,418
- Oh, why-- why-- why me?

99
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,629
- Well, you see,
we've fallen on hard times.

100
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,756
And when we renounced
the material world,

101
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:30,800
and we ask God for nothing,
and in His benevolence,

102
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,929
He gave us nothing
immediately and ever since.

103
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,057
- But Father, we-- we--
we took a vow of poverty.

104
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:38,391
- Oh, we know.

105
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,935
The price of poverty's
gone up.

106
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,938
We can't afford the luxury
of being poor anymore.

107
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,067
Besides, the landlords, they
want $5,000 off the mortgage.

108
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:49,027
- But where can we get
that kind of money, Father?

109
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:50,654
We-- we live by charity.

110
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:52,739
- You're going to save us.

111
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:54,449
You are going
to get us the money.

112
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,326
- How-- how could I?

113
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:56,910
How...
- I'll tell you how.

114
00:08:56,952 --> 00:09:00,789
You go and visit
Armageddon T. Thunderbird.

115
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,543
Armageddon T. Thunderbird,
he's a holy man,

116
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:07,587
a philanthropist,
gives money to worthy causes.

117
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:10,006
You state your case well,
and you'll get the money.

118
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,925
There's his address.
There's his address.

119
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,969
- Father,
I'm-- I'm-- I'm afraid.
I've never been outside.

120
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,845
I'm-- I'm not worthy.
I mean--

121
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,138
- Well, then you'll have
to have some money.

122
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,224
I'll give you $50.
That's all we've got.

123
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,642
There you are.
You take it.

124
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,144
- Ca-- Can I have time
to think it over?

125
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:27,232
- Yes, my son, you'll have
plenty of time to think
about it.

126
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,694
- You see, Father,
I've just never been inside
the outside world.

127
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,988
And--

128
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,281
Help!

129
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,282
( knocks on door )

130
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:38,285
Let me in.
I'm innocent.

131
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,286
I'm innocent.

132
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,745
- Bless you, my son.

133
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,247
Thank you for making
the right decision.

134
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,000
- Let me in.
- God bless, God speed.

135
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,626
Vaya con Dios.

136
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:48,878
- Please, Father.
- Have a nice day.

137
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,631
- Let me in.

138
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,675
( Ambrose cries )

139
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,539
- Whoa!

140
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,629
( yells )

141
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,552
( panting )

142
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:25,058
( vehicle approaches )

143
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,768
( honks )

144
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,586
( tires screech )

145
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,896
( tires screech )

146
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,524
( bells chime )

147
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,652
- Greetings,
companion in Christ.

148
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:19,738
Yes, I'm talkin'
to you, Jim.

149
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,824
Is it not written that
those who are cast down
shall be raised up?

150
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,325
Arise and behold.

151
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,660
( bell rings )

152
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:30,290
The chariot of
the Lord awaiteth.

153
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:32,375
Haul thine ass aboard.

154
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,835
- Oh, thank you.

155
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:38,256
( bus backfires )

156
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,889
- This really is
very kind of you.

157
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,101
- Dr. Sebastian Melmoth,
evangelist, doctor of divinity,

158
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,604
wandering scholar,

159
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,064
licensed purveyor of
religious novelties.

160
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:58,026
- Oh, Father Ambrose, monk.

161
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,195
- Welcome to my church.

162
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,823
- This really is a church then?

163
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:06,868
- Ah, yes, a traveling church.

164
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,660
- My goodness.

165
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:11,790
- Like the missionaries of old,
I sally forth across the land,

166
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:14,501
laying the word
on the good people.

167
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,294
- That sounds wonderful.

168
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,922
- Ah, then would you care
for a blast, my son?

169
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,256
- Uh.

170
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,633
- It's a fine holy wine.

171
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,593
I-- I--

172
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,845
oh, you'll be amused
by its humility.

173
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,596
- Uh, no thanks.

174
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:30,892
No, uh, I never drink, except
of course after the wafer.

175
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:31,935
- Ah.

176
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,561
Quite right.

177
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:35,355
Unwise to celebrate

No, I'm not interested

you been thus afflicted?

He stands up straight.

Take your money, son.
The Lord doesn't want it.

229
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:38,186
He doesn't need it.
He's made you whole.

00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:33,708
- Really?

353
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,002
Gee, it's a very nice
thing to say.

354
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:37,545
- No.
- No, it really is.

355
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:40,047
But, then again,
what do you know?

356
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,382
- That's true.

357
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:47,471
Would you, um, like a taste?

358
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:52,310
- Mmm.

359
00:21:52,351 --> 00:21:54,186
- Good?
- Mmm.

360
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:56,063
- Think it needs
a little more mustard, eh?

361
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,189
- No.
- Just--

362
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,233
- It is just right.

363
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,408
You really are
an innocent, aren't you?

364
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:09,994
- I suppose so.

365
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,538
- It's touching.
It really is.

366
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,624
It's touching,
in a disgusting kind of way.

367
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:22,048
- See, I know a lot about
the theory of sin.

368
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,550
But I don't know anything
about the practice.

369
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:29,263
I mean, for instance,
fornication.

370
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:30,973
- What?

371
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:33,225
- The Bible's full of it.

372
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,102
You mustn't do it.
It's sinful.

373
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:36,562
You'll go to hell.

374
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:39,023
But it doesn't tell
you how to do it.

375
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:39,648
So how do you know you're not?

376
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,650
I mean, for all I know,
I might be sitting here

377
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:43,277
right now fornicating.

378
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,737
( Mary snickers )

379
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,072
- No, you're not.
If you were, I'd tell you.

380
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:48,032
- Mm-hmm. Thanks.

381
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,917
That couple over there sucking
each other's mouth, a-- are--

382
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:58,918
- Would you keep it
down a little bit?

383
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,002
- Oh, sorry.

384
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:03,422
Uh, are-- are
they fornicating?

385
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:07,218
- They're kissing.
They're just kissing.

386
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,886
- Kissing.
- That's phase one.

387
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:09,428
- Ah.

388
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,555
- See, now-- now when
they get home,

389
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,182
they'll probably move
into phase two.

390
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:17,770
- Oh, you fornicate
in phases.

391
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:19,480
- Oh, yeah, that is, if
you're not pressed for time.

392
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,064
- Ah.

393
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:23,901
- See, sex-- sex
is very much like a meal.

394
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:24,819
I'll show you.

395
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:28,155
See this menu?

396
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:28,906
If you were gonna order
a meal, right?

397
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,741
- Mm-hmm.

398
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:31,450
- You wouldn't go right for
the main course, would you?

399
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,786
Wouldn't you like to have
a little appetizer first?

400
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:35,663
- Maybe.

401
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,748
- You know, like, uh,
a little chopped liver?

402
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,958
- Oh, uh-huh.

403
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,459
- It's an appetizer.
That's kissing.

404
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,379
That's what kissing is.

405
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,672
Chopped liver.
- Chopped liver.

406
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:46,841
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Yeah, that's all.

407
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:48,592
- Chopped liver.

408
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:49,927
- Good. Chopped liver.

409
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:50,970
- Number one, chopped liver.

410
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,514
Phase one.
- Phase one.

411
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,477
- I wonder-- I wonder if you
would do me a great favor.

412
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,270
- What?

413
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,066
- Well, you see, if all these
phases lead to fornication,

414
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:07,486
um, would you mind writing
down all the things

415
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:11,574
that I must avoid,
in the right order?

416
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,825
If it's not too much trouble.

417
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,494
- Oh, no, listen,
I'd be glad to do it.

418
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:19,248
Um, now what you want--you
want a list here, right?

419
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,791
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

420
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,792
- Of everything you're
not supposed to do.

421
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:22,793
- Everything to avoid.

422
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:25,087
- Okay.
Um, well, number one...

423
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:27,506
- Yeah?

424
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:30,384
- Um, number one,

425
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,303
we went through it already,
is kissing, right?

426
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,846
- Kissing.
- Right?

427
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:36,098
So-- right, kissing.

428
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,559
Now, number two,

429
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:43,731
take hold of the, uh...

430
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,691
- Bumpy bits.

431
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:49,069
- Yeah. Shh.
Take it, but not like that.

432
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,112
You could hurt
someone like that.

433
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,655
It's not a claw.

434
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:54,658
It's a very gentle
kind of movement.

435
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,869
You know, it's like
a very caressing...

436
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:59,497
Mmm. Mmm.

437
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:01,373
- Mmm.
- Oh, that's very nice.

438
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:03,125
- Mmm.
- Mmm, that's good.

439
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:03,918
That's good.
That's good.

440
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,169
Okay.

441
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,128
Number two, right.

442
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,463
- Mmm.

443
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:07,963
- No, it's okay.
You can stop that.

444
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,757
Just keep it to yourself.
Okay?

445
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:12,468
- I-- I've got it.
- Take hold of the bits.

446
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,053
I'll just put-- you'll
remember, right?
- Okay.

447
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,764
- Now, number three...
- Yeah.

448
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:19,016
- Now, number three
is very technical.

449
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:21,685
- Yeah.
- So I'm gonna draw you a
diagram in number three, okay?

450
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:24,146
- Now, this is
a picture of a woman.

451
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:25,814
- Aha. Yes.
I can see the bumpy bits.

452
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:28,067
- No, those are
the puffed sleeves.

453
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,401
She's wearing a dress.
- Oh.

454
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:30,819
- And then you make love.

455
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:31,946
I don't know why you always
get that one wrong.

456
00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:33,239
- Oh.
- You get into bed first.

457
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,365
- Bed.
- Then make love.

458
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:35,699
- Oh.
- Use your logic on that one.

459
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:37,826
- So my 74 goes where my 75 was.
- Yes.

460
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,828
'Cause, you know, making love's
supposed to be spontaneous.

461
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,330
Why do you think there
are hundreds of books out

462
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,873
on how to do it right?

463
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:44,750
Well, this is where I live.

464
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,586
- Oh. Oh, good night.

465
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,422
- Yeah.
Uh, where you staying tonight?

466
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:51,757
- Oh, I don't know.
I'll find somewhere.

467
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,967
- Sure you'll be all right?

468
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,593
- Oh, yeah.
I've got lots of money.

469
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,637
The Abbott gave me
more than $50.

470
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,680
I have--

471
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:03,352
No more.

472
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,937
- What?

473
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,480
- No, it's nothing.

474
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:09,108
- Okay. Bye.

475
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:10,818
- Good night.
- Good night.

476
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:28,836
( water running )

477
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:31,255
( Mary hums )

478
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:45,436
- Number one,
chopped liver, kissing.

479
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:47,146
( kisses )

480
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:49,440
Number two,

481
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:55,154
mmm, mmm, mmm.

482
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,740
Number three--
number three was...

483
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,908
( chuckles )

484
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,036
Oh, so many things
to remember to avoid.

485
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:04,788
Hello, God,
it's me, Ambrose.

486
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,083
Sorry to bother You,
but if You wanted us

487
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,879
to ignore fleshly sins,
why did You make us
out of meat?

488
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,714
I mean, You could have
made us out of anything.

489
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:16,300
You could have made us
out of burlap, or rubber,

490
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:19,219
or wood, Jell-O, anything.

491
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,305
( sighs )
I know.

492
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:23,015
You work in mysterious ways.

493
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,475
Be we don't.

494
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:27,436
Human beings, I mean.

495
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:28,812
- Tomorrow night,
I'll take you

496
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:31,315
to see Armageddon T.
Thunderbird if you want.

497
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:33,025
By the way, what's your name?

498
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:35,027
- Ambrose.

499
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,654
- Good night, Ambrose.

500
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,656
My name is Mary.

501
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:42,618
- Mary?

502
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,578
( grunts )

503
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:50,000
I can't stand it anymore.
Can't stand it.

504
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:54,380
( shower running )

505
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:55,881
- What are you doing in there?

506
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,175
- The Abbot said
if everything else fails,

507
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:02,304
cold shower will do it.

508
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,306
Bumpy bits.

509
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,726
Mmm. Mmm.

510
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:09,269
Ooh. Ooh.

511
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:16,694
( organ music plays )

512
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,388
- Heh.
With a chicken.

513
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,347
( laughing )

514
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,100
Get out of here,
you filthy swine.

515
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,768
Out.

516
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,605
Next.
Serving number 12.

517
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,528
Serving number 12.

518
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:11,415
Kneel down and
make it snappy.

519
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:16,587
Cut the frills and get
straight to the meat
and potatoes.

520
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:18,922
- Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

521
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:20,174
- Yes, yes.

522
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:21,550
( hearing aid whines )

523
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,011
Oh-- oh, won't you wh--
whine to me about it.

524
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:27,347
You want to whine about this,
and you whine about that.

525
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,684
And the, uh, oh.

526
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,978
ah, death and transfiguration.

527
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,397
Don't worry about me.

528
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,442
Uh, if you'll just start,
and I'll get the--

529
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,194
I'll get the general drift.

530
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:44,323
- Last night, Father, I was
tormented by an impure thought.

531
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:45,657
- I can't hear you.

532
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:49,119
- I said I was tormented
by an impure thought.

533
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:51,997
- Could you-- could you
speak up, please?

534
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,874
- I-- it was about Mary.

535
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,542
- What? Louder.

536
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,170
- Mary, I wanted
to take her clothes off.

537
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,881
- You wanted to do what? Speak
up. I can't hear you!

538
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:03,175
- I wanted to take
her clothes off.

539
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:04,593
You are mumbling!

540
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,512
- I wanted to take
her clothes off

541
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:08,972
and caress her bumpy bits.

542
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:10,557
- Her what?
- Bits.

543
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,976
Fondly, you know, mmm.

544
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:16,730
- What?
- You know, number three.

545
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:20,275
And then I wanted
to try number 30.

546
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:24,571
Or-- or-- or maybe do
number 15 twice instead.

547
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:27,241
And then I wanted
to take her by the...

548
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:28,700
( horns honking )

549
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:29,743
And...

550
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:30,744
( car horns honking )

551
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:33,664
Both her-- again and again

552
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:37,125
until I was exhausted.

553
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:40,671
But I'm a monk, Father.

554
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,631
What shall I do?

555
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:45,717
- I didn't hear
a damned word you said.

556
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,302
That'll be, uh...

557
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,846
- I'm afraid
I only have, uh...

558
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:51,098
- Two dollars.
Here, I will have that.

559
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,016
Uh, have a nice day.

560
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,728
( parishioners muttering )

561
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:01,733
( clears throat )

562
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:18,083
( cheering )

563
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:25,841
- Do you believe in God?

564
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,886
( cheering )

565
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:37,895
- Announcer: The Church
of Divine Profit
humbly presents

566
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:41,815
the Armageddon T. Thunderbird
Crusade.

567
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:46,528
And here he is,
God's buddy, A.T.T. himself.

568
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,868
- Do you love God?

569
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,828
- Yes!

570
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,998
- I mean, do you
really love God?

571
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,333
- Yes!

572
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:01,043
- Has He been good to you?

573
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:02,711
- Yes.

574
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:04,421
- I thought so.

575
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,882
And have you been good to Him?

576
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,175
- Yes.

577
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:09,801
- Oh, really?

578
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:12,012
- Yes.

579
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:14,556
- Liars.
- No!

580
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:18,936
- 'Cause I just spoke to Him,
and do you have any idea
where He is right now?

581
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:20,520
- No.

582
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:23,106
- God is in the hospital.

583
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:25,984
( crowd gasping )

584
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:28,362
- In the Intensive Care Unit.

585
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:29,905
And do you know
who put Him there?

586
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,239
- No.

587
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,533
- Y-O-U.

588
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:34,743
( crowd shouting )

589
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:40,958
- He-- he looked so pale.

590
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:42,542
( crying )

591
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,469
- Why are you cryin'?

592
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:53,971
Isn't that what you wanted?

593
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:55,722
- No!

594
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:56,890
- Do you wanna see Him
pull through?

595
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:58,725
- Yes!

596
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,728
- All right.
I said to Him, I am
your servant, Lord.

597
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,522
What do You want?

598
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:06,566
Everything, Armageddon,
everything.

599
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:09,528
I need money to put it right.

600
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:13,991
But what will You give them
in return? I queried.

601
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:18,996
And then He said, I will
assure them a place forever

602
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:21,331
in the kingdom of heaven.

603
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,583
( applause )

604
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:27,129
- And that's--
and that's rent free.

605
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,007
Now, doesn't that sound
like a good deal?

606
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:31,675
- Yeah!

607
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:35,887
- Well, then put thy money
where is thy mouth.

608
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:39,099
And I'm not just
askin' the people here
in the studio audience.

609
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:44,062
I'm askin' you,
you, and you.

he was talking about.

623
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,287
Supposed to be a Christian.

624
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,164
I-- I don't understand.

625
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:47,459
- This is awfully confusing
for you, isn't it?

626
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,586
- It is a bit.

627
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:53,090
- Well, I think you've had
a big day.

628
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:55,509
And I think you should go
to sleep now, okay?

629
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,594
You look sweet in pink.

630
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:00,138
- Mmm.

631
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,100
I'm gonna go
and see him tomorrow.

632
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:05,519
- You're gonna go
see Armageddon?

633
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,020
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:11,399
When he understands,
he'll help.

635
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:12,442
( Mary sighs )

636
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:14,986
- Poor Ambrose.

637
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:19,199
I wonder if God will ever
forgive you your virtues.

638
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:29,167
- Excuse me.

639
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,720
( shower running )

640
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:02,033
- Good afternoon.
I'd-- I'd like to see
Mr. Thunderbird. I--

641
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:03,493
- Not today.
He's too busy.

642
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:04,536
- No. I-- I have
this letter from--

643
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:05,579
from the Abbot.
- Get out of here.

644
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,746
- I'm-- I'm one of the meek.

645
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:08,498
I'm supposed
to inherit the Earth.

646
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,708
- You've got it.

647
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,888
- You just don't understand,
Ambrose.

648
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,389
- I understand
I don't understand.

649
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:25,724
But what
don't I understand?

650
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:27,601
- Well, the meek may inherit
the Earth but not

651
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,352
until the strong
are finished with it.

652
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:31,563
And by that time, it won't
even be worth having.

653
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,981
- I'll get in
to see him finally.

654
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,191
- But it could take weeks.

655
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:35,567
- I'll get a job
in the meantime.

656
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:36,109
Look, is there anything
in the paper?

657
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:39,404
- Oh, look, Ambrose, listen.
- What?

658
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:41,072
- You don't need to work.
I mean, look,

659
00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:43,325
you could come
and stay at my place, right?

660
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:45,785
I really do make enough
money for both of us.

661
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:47,621
- W-- what do you do?
- What?

662
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:49,956
- Well, for a living,
what do you do?

663
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:52,834
- Oh, uh, I wouldn't
even concern myself about
that if I were you.

664
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:56,046
- Well, maybe you could get me
a job doing it with you.

665
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:57,714
- Well, I could look into it.

666
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,008
- I'm good with my hands.

667
00:37:17,484 --> 00:37:20,237
( chattering in Spanish )

668
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,754
( hammering )

669
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:53,770
( bell rings )

670
00:38:05,198 --> 00:38:07,033
- Hey. Hey.
Come back.

671
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:09,911
Dr. Melmoth.

672
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,579
Philistine.

673
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:29,472
- All right, monk.

674
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,274
- All right. I'm going.

675
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:47,907
- Hi. You look so nauseous.

676
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:50,118
- Thanks, but I feel rotten.

677
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,746
- Oh, Ambrose, how many times
you gonna keep on trying?

678
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:54,706
- Well, till I get
in and see him.

679
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:56,416
You see, if I could show him
the Abbot's letter,

680
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,792
and then I'd--
- I got an idea.

681
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,544
Couldn't you just pray
to God for the money?

682
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:00,170
- No, no.

683
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:02,714
No, ask for money, and
you spoil a friendship.

684
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,466
No, I've gotta see
him personally.

685
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:07,218
Mr. Thunderbird
will understand.
He's a Christian.

686
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,972
- No, being born in a Christian
home doesn't necessarily

687
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:13,099
make you Christian any
more than being born

688
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:16,019
in a bakery
makes you a bagel.
- Hmm?

689
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,271
- I mean, maybe Mr. Thunderbird
just isn't even interested

690
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:19,898
in your old monastery.

691
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:22,108
- No, no. If I could get in
to see him personally,

692
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,444
I'll get in eventually.
I'll get in. I'll get in.

693
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:25,904
- But it could take months.
- All right.

694
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:27,197
In the meantime, I can
just get another job.

695
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,573
I mean, what can I lose?

696
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,368
- Nothing, just another job.

dum, da, dee, da, dum, dum... ♪

701
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:45,673
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

702
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:47,509
- Don't you ever rest?

703
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,052
- I can't afford
to lose time.

704
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,137
It's Pasadena
by next Wednesday.

705
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,555
That's my schedule.

706
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:55,016
You know, a man's got
to have a goal.

707
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,727
Otherwise,
we've got communism.

708
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:01,856
And I'm tap dancing to keep
this great land of ours free.

709
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,691
I'll see you sometime.

710
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:04,734
- Good luck.
- So long.

711
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:05,735
- Step right up.
Step up, sinners.

712
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:06,361
Step right up and repent.

713
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,863
Do not cop a plea unto
the Almighty, saying,

714
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:10,907
oh, Lord,
I'm but a poor sinner.

715
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,659
For the Lord will say unto
thee, bullshit, my child.

716
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,744
His eye is on the sparrow,
so you can bet your ass

717
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:17,080
He's got you covered, Jim,
and you and you.

718
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:20,417
So step right up and find
the Lord, a buck a throw.

719
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,544
Yes, the Lord
is here in my hand.

720
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:23,586
Everyone wants
to find the Lord.

721
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,130
The Lord goes into hiding.

722
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,423
And those who seek
him will find him.

723
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:28,800
Where is he now?
Try thy luck.

724
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,802
Find the Lord.
Who will find the Lord?

725
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:31,803
It's a wonderful game.
Everybody wins.

726
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:32,429
Everybody goes to heaven.

727
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,264
Try thy luck, a lousy buck
to find the Lord.

728
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:35,682
Aha.

729
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:37,183
Ah, yes, sir,
and now where is he?

730
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:39,018
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

731
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,270
The Lord is not there,
but a blessing to you, too.

732
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,438
The game continues.

733
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:41,938
Try thy luck.

734
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,107
- Dr. Melmoth.
He stole my money.

735
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:45,650
- Excuse me.
- He's a thief.

736
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:47,235
- This man is a heretic.
Don't listen to him.

737
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:48,403
He's obviously deranged.

738
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:50,071
- Stop him. Stop him.
He's a thief.

739
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,156
Give me my money back.

740
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:52,699
- Get outta here.

741
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,118
Fanatic.
Vegetarian!

742
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,995
I'll keep up
the Lord's work.

743
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:58,538
- Oh, oof.
- And get away from me.

744
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,956
Get away from me, you Moabite,
you snake worshipper.

745
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:02,667
Ah. Ooh.

746
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:07,046
And a holy man such as yourself
should descend to violence.

747
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:08,506
( Ambrose grunts )

748
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:11,468
- In the name-- in the name
of all that's sacred,

749
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:13,970
let me up,
you little asshole.

750
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:20,143
- You should be disgusted
with yourself.

751
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:23,146
- Oh, I am.
I am. I am.

752
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:24,772
Pray for me.

753
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:29,110
Let thy hand,
which is raised in violence,

754
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:33,907
clasp its brother and,
in heavenly supplication,
even as I do,

755
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:39,579
Father, forgive him, for he
knoweth not what he doeth.

756
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:45,043
Forgive me even more,
for I knoweth.

757
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:47,086
( grunts )

758
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:48,755
- Take that, monk.

759
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:53,551
( bus engine starts )

760
00:41:55,136 --> 00:41:58,056
- Wait for me.
Stop. Wait for me!

761
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,269
Of course I forgive you.

762
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:05,230
But I still don't know
what I'm doing here.

763
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:07,232
- Well, look, I'm-- I'm offering
you the chance of a lifetime,

764
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:09,901
a full partnership
in my church for nothing.

765
00:42:09,943 --> 00:42:12,320
- Why me?

766
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:14,280
- Because you have
a certain quality,

767
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:16,741
a kind of eerie innocence.

768
00:42:16,783 --> 00:42:20,495
People look at you,
and they have to believe

769
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:22,413
there's a better
world somewhere.

770
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:24,791
Besides, I'm slowing down.

771
00:42:24,832 --> 00:42:27,710
- Well, could I make enough
money to save the monastery?

772
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:30,463
I need $5,000.
- But, of course.

773
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:33,758
- What have I got to lose?

774
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,136
- Partners.
- Partners.

775
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:38,555
- Ha.

776
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:47,230
( "I've Been Working
On the Railroad" plays )

777
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,652
( horn honks )

778
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:58,533
( chatter )

779
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:11,462
- Ambrose, hi.

780
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:13,006
What are you doing here?

781
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:15,091
- Well, thought we could go
out tonight and celebrate.

782
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,093
- I just can't.

783
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:18,303
( horn honks )

784
00:43:18,344 --> 00:43:19,470
Listen, I'm really sorry.

785
00:43:19,512 --> 00:43:20,722
But it's just, you know,
Friday night.

786
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:21,556
And then, you know,
it's my big night.

787
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:22,807
And I just...

788
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:24,559
( honking continues )

789
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,477
I-- I couldn't-- I mean,
I couldn't just-- I mean,

790
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,187
I'm not dressed to go
anywhere, you know.

791
00:43:28,229 --> 00:43:29,397
- Look.

792
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,736
You look-- you look lovely.

793
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:38,740
- Oh, Ambrose,
that is so beautiful.

794
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:42,201
- Shall we go?
- I'm sorry. I can't.

795
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:44,871
- Yeah, I understand.

796
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:47,165
I mean, if you'd rather
be here with your friends,

797
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:50,001
well, hey, that's okay.
I can...

798
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:51,294
- I'll see you later, okay?
- See you later. Yeah.

799
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:53,880
- Okay. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

800
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,799
( honking )

801
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:06,476
- Where are we going?

802
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:09,437
- Oh, well, it's bingo night at
the all-night mission, and I--

803
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:10,855
- I've had it now.
Come on.

804
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:13,066
It's all right.
Come on, baby.

805
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:15,276
- Stop it!
- Come on.

806
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:17,779
- No, you stop that.

807
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:22,659
- Excuse me, sir.

808
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,035
That was very rude.

809
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:26,621
I'm sure you didn't
mean it.

810
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:30,249
Now, according to,
uh, Timothy,

811
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:33,836
chapter 2, verse 25,
be gentle unto all men.

812
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:35,713
But, of course,
that means all women, too.

813
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:36,714
( grunts )

814
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,216
- Oh, what are you doing to him?

815
00:44:38,257 --> 00:44:40,259
- Perhaps you prefer
St. Matthew.

816
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:42,845
Thou shalt love thy enemies.

817
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:46,224
In other words,
do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.

818
00:44:46,265 --> 00:44:49,435
- You wouldn't wish me
to do this unto you.

819
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,778
- Take the gospel
according to St. Mark.

820
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,031
Now, it isn't me
you're hurting. It's you.

821
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:05,493
It's your soul that's in pain,
your immortal soul.

822
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,248
Excuse me, sir.

823
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:15,253
On the other hand, there's
the Old Testament.

824
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:16,671
David and Goliath.

825
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:32,061
- You just don't really
understand is that

826
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:35,982
you can't always have everything
just the way you want it.

827
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:39,318
You know, it may not be
the best of all possible worlds,

828
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,696
but it's the only
damn one we've got.

829
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:44,907
That's what my Pop
used to say anyway.

830
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:48,619
- What was he like,
your Pop?

831
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:52,623
- I don't remember much about
him, except his legs.

832
00:45:52,665 --> 00:45:57,712
He had an angel
flying up his right leg

833
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:01,841
and he had a devil crawling
down his left leg

834
00:46:01,883 --> 00:46:05,511
and disappearing
into his sock.

835
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:06,888
- Huh?

836
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:08,055
- Tattoo.

837
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:09,015
- Oh.
- He had tattoos.

838
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:10,391
- Oh.

839
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:13,644
- He ran out on us
when I was three, so....

840
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:17,231
- At least you know
who your father was.

841
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:19,484
I was abandoned on
a monastery doorstep.

842
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:21,819
There was just a little note.

843
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:24,489
"Attached child is
a gift from God.

844
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:28,284
P.S. Please return
to sender."

845
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:44,383
- You-- you don't, uh,
have to sleep

846
00:46:44,425 --> 00:46:47,094
in the other room if you
don't want to tonight.

847
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:50,681
I mean, you know you could stay
in here with me if you like.

848
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:55,895
- Excuse me.

849
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,521
- For what we are about
to receive,

850
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:41,774
may the Lord make us
truly thankful.

we met, you said you liked it.

Mmm. Mmm.
So good.

- Not too much mustard?

869

- Mm-mm.

870
00:49:01,646 --> 00:49:04,065
I am so full.

00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:08,444
Mmm.

874
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:11,280
- Listen, um, about last night,
uh,

875
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:14,033
did I, um, did we...

876
00:49:14,075 --> 00:49:15,618
- Mm-hmm.

877
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,328
We went through
the whole menu.

878
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,788
( chuckles )

879
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,375
You may check off items
number one through 75.

880
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,335
- Did I really do all that?

881
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:29,799
- Yeah. Well, not in one go.
Let me put it this way.

882
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,095
See, we both should have
arrived at 72 at the same time.

883
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:38,057
But you got to 72 while
I was still, you know,

884
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,101
hangin' around number nine.

885
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:41,519
But that's just
a technicality.

886
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,896
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly.

887
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:46,691
You know, nice guys
sometimes finish first.

888
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:49,777
Just think of it as
a sin of emission.

889
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:51,487
- You've done this before,
haven't you?

890
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:52,947
I can tell.

891
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,782
- You could tell? How?

892
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:57,451
- You kept screaming,
get to 11, get to 11.

893
00:49:57,493 --> 00:49:59,245
- Did I do that?

894
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:00,538
- Get to 11, yeah.

895
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:02,665
- Oh, I'm sorry.

896
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:05,918
It's just, well,
I guess number 11

897
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,504
has always been one
of my favorites.

898
00:50:10,256 --> 00:50:14,802
Listen, Ambrose, I don't
wanna upset you, but...

899
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:16,429
- What?

900
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,933
- I have to be honest
with you.

901
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,393
- What?

902
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:25,271
- I'm a hooker.

903
00:50:25,312 --> 00:50:26,022
- Well, I know.
- A harlot.

904
00:50:26,063 --> 00:50:27,356
- I know.

905
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:28,983
- I'm like a whore
from your Bible.

906
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,192
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?

907
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:32,361
- I worked it out.

908
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,113
- And you're not shocked?

909
00:50:34,155 --> 00:50:35,698
- About what?

910
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,117
- That-- me being a hooker.

911
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:39,994
- No.

912
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,581
It's just the outside world
is nothing like anything

913
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:44,915
I was taught in
the monastery.

914
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:46,917
I'm just a bit, well,
confused, you know.

915
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,503
- So you mean you do
have doubts, huh?

916
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:51,630
- Mm, doubts are about
the only certainties

917
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:53,674
I have right now, you know?

918
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:56,719
- So then you'll be going, uh,
back to the monastery?

919
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:59,430
- Eventually, yeah.

920
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:01,348
I mean, it's my home.

921
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,311
- When are you gonna go?

922
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:06,896
- After I see Mr. Thunderbird.

923
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,906
Well, I suppose
I better get dressed.

924
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:31,921
By the way, um,
I think I love you.

925
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:33,547
Do you mind?

926
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:35,549
- Heh.

927
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:38,427
Do I mind?

928
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:13,254
- Potsville, the string
cheese capital of the world.

929
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:18,050
- Aha. Where there
is string cheese, sin
cannot be far behind.

930
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:20,511
( music on PA system )

931
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:23,222
- Good afternoon,
idle sinners of Potsville.

932
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:26,559
Salvation is at hand.

933
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,185
Let Dr. Melmoth bring
peace to your souls

934
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:30,020
through the Good Book.

935
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:35,276
- Good afternoon,
voters of Potsville.

936
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:37,194
Let Mayor Dwork bring peace
to your city

937
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:39,321
through law and order.

938
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:43,409
I say-- I say put the lazy bums
to work and get 'em off
welfare.

939
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,412
- For their welfare is my
concern, sayeth the Lord.

940
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:48,747
For the Lord's way
is the way of right.

941
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:51,417
The Lord is coming through.

942
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,836
- Like hell he is.
He hasn't got right-of-way.

943
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:55,629
He don't give preference
over the Grand Old Party.

944
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,214
Back off, lard-ass.

945
00:52:57,256 --> 00:52:58,841
- Up thine, Brother.

946
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:01,427
- Yeah? You gonna move
that heap of crap?

947
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:02,970
- No.

948
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:10,269
Okay. So it's dirty pool
you want.

949
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:13,731
Well, the Lord knows
that game, too.

950
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:17,985
All right.
It's God versus democracy.

951
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:21,405
Yee-haw.

952
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:26,744
- Commie Jesus freaks!

953
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,667
- Yee-haw!

954
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:40,507
- All right, Cox.

955
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:42,760
God wins every time.

956
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:45,804

when ye entered herein,

963
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:23,217
did ye not turn unto
yeselves and say,

964
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:26,262
why has he locked the door?

965
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,971
I'll tell you why.

966
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:33,978
Because it is too easy
to turn from the Lord and run.

967
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:39,483
Moses, when he saw the burning
bush, did not turn and run.

968
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:45,948
No, I did not turn and run
when I saw the burning bush.

969
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,866
Aye, who's that?

970
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:51,120
Why, who could that be?

971
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:54,498
Why, it's Moses himself.

972
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,459
( applause )

973
00:54:57,501 --> 00:54:58,919
( organ music plays
"Hava Nagila" )

974
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:02,589
- Let's hear it for him,
wonderful Biblical prophet.

975
00:55:02,631 --> 00:55:04,466
What happened to you when
you saw the burning bush?

976
00:55:04,508 --> 00:55:07,428
- I was God-struck.
- You were what?

977
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,054
- God-struck.

978
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:11,724
- You mean you were
dumbstruck, dummy.

979
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:14,768
- Well, that's what
I thought I said.

980
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,229
- Seriously-- seriously,
that concludes-- thank you.

981
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:20,190
- ( applause )
- Whew.

982
00:55:20,232 --> 00:55:22,609
And now that concludes
the entertainment portion
of our show.

983
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:26,405
And, uh, for the next segment,
uh, we shall all join

984
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:29,867
little Moses in singing
"We Shall Gather by the River"

985
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:33,412
whilst I partake of
some communion wine

986
00:55:33,454 --> 00:55:38,667
and a very fine Puerto Ricanyo
cigar simultaneously.

987
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:41,837
Thank you.
Thank you.

- Taped this for
you earlier, A.T.T.

1012
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:49,923
We thought you
might be interested.

1013
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,220
- In Peru today,
5,000 died in an earthquake.

1014
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:58,974
There's news of a train crash
in Turkey which killed 400.

1015
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:01,935
But it's going to be
another lovely day tomorrow

1016
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:07,024
with temperatures in the high
'70s, so mostly it's good news.

1017
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:11,487
On the local front, a mobile
church crashed in mid-service
into a lake in Orange County.

1018
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,238
Fortunately, nobody was hurt,

1019
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,324
but one of the promoters
in this scheme,

1020
00:58:15,365 --> 00:58:19,369
a Dr. Sebastian Melmoth, here
seen baptizing the survivors,

1021
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:21,914
described it as an act
of God and said

1022
00:58:21,955 --> 00:58:25,292
he's considering suing God's
business manager, the Pope.

1023
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:27,836
His partner, a Brother Ambrose,
an alleged monk,

1024
00:58:27,878 --> 00:58:29,171
was not available
for comments.

1025
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:31,298
- Prayer mobiles.

1026
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,426
- Thought we'd just
run it up the Crucifix
and see who genuflects.

1027
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:39,306
- Mobile churches,
covering the whole country,

1028
00:58:39,348 --> 00:58:41,266
just think of it,
the whole country.

1029
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:46,230
You can fool some of
the people all the time

1030
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:50,025
and those are
the sons of bitches
we gonna get.

1031
00:58:50,067 --> 00:58:54,863
Now we could have every
sinner's balls in our hands.

1032
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:58,033
Just how much we decide
to squeeze 'em for

1033
00:58:58,075 --> 00:58:59,409
will be G.O.D.'s decision.

1034
00:58:59,451 --> 00:59:01,453
- Uh, Miss Milligan?

1035
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:04,706
- We can have Miss Milligan
here prepare some ballpark
figures on the scheme.

1036
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:07,459
- Oh, well, yes.

1037
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,170
- You'll get back to us on it?

1038
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:13,549
- Yeah-- yeah, soonest,
soonest, soonest.

1039
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,133
I have a one o'clock
with G.O.D., you know,

1040
00:59:15,175 --> 00:59:16,843
huddles and confab.

1041
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:19,721
Uh, it'll be numero uno
on the agenda.

1042
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:28,647
I'm comin', G.O.D.

1043
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:32,317
Thy will be done.

1044
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:02,097
Oh, G.O.D., in whom we trust,

1045
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:05,350
who adviseth me
and all the workings

1046
01:00:05,392 --> 01:00:07,352
His great conglomerate,

1047
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:12,274
C.D.P., consider
this proposition.

1048
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,068
- Approved.

1049
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,030
But you cannot
be everywhere.

1050
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:21,992
We need a disciple
to lead our crusade,

1051
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:27,164
somebody pure, devout,
without a record,

1052
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:31,460
someone a Congressional
committee wouldn't suspect.

1053
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:35,589
- Dost thou have someone
in mind, O Mighty One?

1054
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:40,344
- Ask thyself, and
it shall answer thee.

1055
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:42,554
- The monk?

1056
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:44,264
You believe he could--

1057
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:46,266
- Consider the bears
in the wood.

1058
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,602
Crappeth, they not?

1059
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:52,147
Of course, the monk,
you dumb schmuck.

1060
01:00:52,189 --> 01:00:53,690
( knock on door )

1061
01:00:57,778 --> 01:00:59,655
- I saw it on the news.
Are you all right?

1062
01:00:59,696 --> 01:01:00,656
- I-- I'm all right.

1063
01:01:00,697 --> 01:01:03,200
Yes, uh, Dr. Melmoth's
a bit--

1064
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:04,242
well, we stopped
at a few bars.

1065
01:01:04,284 --> 01:01:05,702
- Oh. Okay.

1066
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:07,120
Why don't you, uh, put him
to sleep there,

1067
01:01:07,162 --> 01:01:08,205
and I'll get
some black coffee.

1068
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:10,707
- Yeah.

1069
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:26,264
( grunts )

1070
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:52,207
( groans )

1071
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:55,919
- When I was in the water
back there, I was drowning.

1072
01:01:55,961 --> 01:01:59,881
My whole life flashed
before my eyes,

1073
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:03,885
and I wasn't in it.

1074
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:05,554
( sobs )

1075
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,653
- Whoa.

1076
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:45,719
( groans )

1077
01:02:54,227 --> 01:02:56,271
- Okay. The coffee's
almost ready.

1078
01:02:56,313 --> 01:02:58,440
I hope he likes drip.

1079
01:02:58,482 --> 01:03:00,358
- It's no use.

1080
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,985
- Listen, you can start again.

1081
01:03:02,027 --> 01:03:04,029
- No, it's too late.
I'm too old.

1082
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,781
- No.

1083
01:03:05,822 --> 01:03:08,909
- I had talent once.
I-- I had ambition.

1084
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,203
I had-- I had hands.

1085
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:15,123
I had wonderful hands.

1086
01:03:15,165 --> 01:03:16,958
I could have been somebody.

1087
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,211
I could have been a Bishop.

1088
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:24,007
I could have preached a
revival in a ballpark outdoors.

1089
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:29,721
Instead, here I am selling
Lazarus dolls in the suburbs.

1090
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:31,056
- Yeah, well, may-- maybe
they'll help some people.

1091
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:32,766
- That ain't it.

1092
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:36,561
I could have said mass,
instead of being a bum.

1093
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:39,940
Face it.
I'm a bum.

1094
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:43,985
And now, I'll work
on my sermon.

1095
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:45,987
- Could I--
- I'll sleep now.

1096
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:49,199
For tomorrow's sermon...
- Sleep.

1097
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:50,992
- Tomorrow's sermon...

1098
01:03:52,035 --> 01:03:54,871
- Here you go.

1099
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:57,165
( pounding on door )

1100
01:04:18,395 --> 01:04:20,021
- Hello?

1101
01:04:20,063 --> 01:04:22,148
Hello?

1102
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,943
Hello? Is anybody there?

1103
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:28,446
( thunder )

1104
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:35,579
- Mr. Thunderbird.

1105
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,081
- He.

1106
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:40,625
- I've been tryin'
to see you for months.

1107
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,460
I have this letter
from the Abbot.

1108
01:04:42,502 --> 01:04:43,503
It's about the mortgage
on the monastery.

1109
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:46,631
- I know.
- You know?

1110
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:51,803
- I have the mortgage deed
to your monastery.

1111
01:04:51,845 --> 01:04:55,015
It will be yours
in good time.

1112
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:58,435
God spake unto me of
this even this day.

1113
01:04:58,476 --> 01:05:00,645
- God-- God speaks to you?

1114
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:02,314
- Spake.
- Spake.

1115
01:05:02,355 --> 01:05:06,776
God spakes, uh, talks to you
personally with-- with words?

1116
01:05:06,818 --> 01:05:07,444
- Of course.

1117
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:13,033
- Well, I mean, I-- I--
spake-- I speak with Him.

1118
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:14,534
But, you know,
when You're busy,

1119
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:16,161
and You're a celebrity,
I suppose you don't really

1120
01:05:16,202 --> 01:05:17,203
have much time to...

1121
01:05:17,245 --> 01:05:18,997
- Oh, He listens.

1122
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,624
We speak of you often.

1123
01:05:20,665 --> 01:05:22,834
You know, He's very
fond of you, Ambrose.

1124
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:25,587
- I-- I feel
the same way about Him. I--

1125
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:27,297
- You see, everything
in your life has been

1126
01:05:27,339 --> 01:05:29,257
leading up to this moment.

1127
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:33,887
God has chosen you,
Brother Ambrose,

1128
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:37,390
to lead his nationwide
mobile crusade.

1129
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:38,600
- Me?

1130
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:43,229
He-- He-- He mentioned me
s-- specifically?

1131
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,106
- You.

1132
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:46,733
And you shall be rewarded.

1133
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:48,818
Is not the laborer
worthy of His hire?

1134
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,404
- Look, Mr. Thunderbird,
um, may-- may I--

1135
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:52,238
may I be honest with you?

1136
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,698
- Why surely.

1137
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,408
- You see, in your--
in your services,

1138
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,369
all you do is--
is talk about money.

1139
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,954
I thought virtue
was its own reward.

1140
01:05:58,995 --> 01:06:00,372
- Of course it is.

1141
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:02,415
That's why it doesn't
attract the top talent.

1142
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:05,251
- But the Bible, God's book,

1143
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:06,878
says we should share
the money equally.

1144
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,672
- Wrong.

1145
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:11,841
If God had not meant for some
people to be poorer than others,

1146
01:06:11,883 --> 01:06:14,386
then He would not have published
the Bible in paperback.

1147
01:06:14,427 --> 01:06:17,180
- I-- I-- just can't believe
that life is only money.

1148
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:18,765
- Money is life.

1149
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:21,142
It is the lack of it
which is the real evil.

1150
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:24,020
Who feedeth the hungry?

1151
01:06:24,062 --> 01:06:25,939
Is it manna from heaven

1152
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:28,483
or fried chicken
from Kentucky?

1153
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:30,110
Who clotheth the naked?

1154
01:06:30,151 --> 01:06:32,612
Is it J.C.?

1155
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:34,698
Or is it J.C. Penney?

1156
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:37,993
And what will save
your wretched monastery?

1157
01:06:38,034 --> 01:06:40,495
A miracle?

1158
01:06:40,537 --> 01:06:44,165
Or $5,000 cash?

1159
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:45,333
- It's true.

1160
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,793
- Oh, no, my friend.

1161
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:48,545
Money is clean.

1162
01:06:48,586 --> 01:06:52,382
Money is beautiful.

1163
01:06:52,424 --> 01:06:54,884
Money is holy.

1164
01:06:54,926 --> 01:06:58,054
I need it to
support my hospitals,

1165
01:06:58,096 --> 01:07:02,017
my charities,
my worthy causes.

1166
01:07:02,058 --> 01:07:06,229
You shall go forth
and gather it in.

1167
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:11,317
That is what God
has chosen you for.

1168

- Ah, turn around

1198
01:09:26,494 --> 01:09:28,413
and don't open your eyes
'till I tell you.

1199
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:32,000
- That's funny.

1200
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,419
I was just about to ask you
to do the same thing.

1201
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:38,256
- All right.

1202
01:09:38,298 --> 01:09:40,133
Surprise.

1203
01:10:04,115 --> 01:10:05,658
( cork pops )

1204
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:10,788
- To your
little misconception.

1205
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,956
( chuckles )

1206
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:16,961
- Well, why not?
- No.

1207
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:18,379
- Why? Why-- why not?
- No.

1208
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:20,089
What if it turns out
to be a girl?

1209
01:10:20,131 --> 01:10:22,008
- Well, Armageddon could be a
girl's name, couldn't it?

1210
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:25,845
- You know, I don't know
what the hell has come
over you, Ambrose.

1211
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:27,388
But you come in here.

1212
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,766
You're wearing
a cockamamie silk dress.

1213
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:31,559
- It's not a dress.
It's a robe.

1214
01:10:31,601 --> 01:10:32,685
Armageddon said it would
be good for the whole--

1215
01:10:32,727 --> 01:10:34,437
- Armageddon says,
Armageddon says.

1216
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,357
All you give me are his words.

1217
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:40,109
I don't want anything
that's been in his mouth.

1218
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:43,905
You have swallowed all this crap
that Armageddon's fed you.

1219
01:10:43,947 --> 01:10:46,783
Well, it's true.
And you are what you eat.

1220
01:10:46,824 --> 01:10:49,494
- Mr. Melmoth,
would you explain--

1221
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:52,080
- I don't need him
to explain it to me.

1222
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:55,333
- Look, now just
leave me outta this.

1223
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:57,961
I don't want any hassle.

1224
01:10:58,002 --> 01:11:00,338
I just want peace
in my old age.

1225
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,216
- Well, tell her about
Armageddon's charities,
about his hospitals.

1226
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:04,926
He's doing God's work.

1227
01:11:04,968 --> 01:11:08,304
- Horseshit.
He's doin' Armageddon's work.

1228
01:11:08,346 --> 01:11:12,016
It's a rip-off.
It's big business.

1229
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:13,476
It's--
- You can't just say that.

1230
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:14,894
What-- what-- what proof--
- Proof?

1231
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:16,771
- Yeah.
- There is no proof.

1232
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:19,607
But every hustler on the street
knows what this guy is.

1233
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:22,360
- Why did you wait till
now before you told me?

1234
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:24,529
- Because I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

1235
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,322
That's why.
- Feelings.

1236
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:29,033
- And I thought maybe he'll
figure this one out for himself.

1237
01:11:29,075 --> 01:11:31,911
- Dr. Melmoth,
you're a man of God.

1238
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:34,497
If this is true, you just sit
here, and you just accept it?

1239
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:36,374
- Look, get outta my face,
will ya, monk?

1240
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:38,584
Just leave me alone.

1241
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:41,504
You're like some
holy Jiminy Cricket.

1242
01:11:41,546 --> 01:11:45,717
You're damn right
I accept it.

1243
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:48,678
This may not be the best
of all possible worlds,

1244
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,263
but it's the only
world we've got.

1245
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:52,515
So don't make waves.

1246
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:57,603
Because, unlike Jesus,
we can't walk on 'em.

1247
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:09,032
- Why the hell did you
have to open your mouth
in the first place?

1248
01:12:09,073 --> 01:12:09,657
- Correction.

1249
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:12,243
You opened your mouth
in the first place.

1250
01:12:12,285 --> 01:12:14,662
I opened my mouth
in the second place.

1251
01:12:14,704 --> 01:12:19,792
Look, I couldn't
take being born again.

1252
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:24,630
At my age, I couldn't
stand the labor pains.

1253
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,558
Monk off.

1254
01:12:39,145 --> 01:12:41,773
- Oh, G.O.D.,
in whom we trust,

1255
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:44,650
there's somethin'
I wanna ask you about.

1256
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:49,072
Now, You and I have made
millions together, right?

1257
01:12:49,113 --> 01:12:51,199
- Check.

1258
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,992
- How much do we own?

1259
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:54,619
- Bottom line?

1260
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,162
- Yes, bottom line.

1261
01:12:56,204 --> 01:13:00,875
- 10,342,000.08 net.

1262
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:02,627
- Uh-huh.

1263
01:13:02,668 --> 01:13:04,796
Well-- well, now that's
how much we own.

1264
01:13:04,837 --> 01:13:07,465
But You know money
can't buy happiness.

1265
01:13:07,507 --> 01:13:09,300
Only power can do that.

1266
01:13:09,342 --> 01:13:11,010
Who do we own?

1267
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:16,474
- Five senators, 14 congressmen,
two Supreme Court judges,

1268
01:13:16,516 --> 01:13:18,434
12 assorted
missile manufacturers,

1269
01:13:18,476 --> 01:13:22,355
and an ex-president, net.

1270
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:25,066
- Well, then today,
on my telecast--

1271
01:13:25,108 --> 01:13:26,317
- The time is right.

1272
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:30,113
The country is ready
for a strong leader.

1273
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:33,032
May God go with you.

1274
01:13:33,074 --> 01:13:34,826
- But You are God.

1275
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:36,577
- Oh, so I am.

1276
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:37,578
Correction.

1277
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,288
May I go with you.

1278
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,249
Good luck with your show.

1279
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:43,543
And break a leg, kid.

1280
01:13:43,584 --> 01:13:45,336
- Amen.

1281
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:48,673
( humming )

1282
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,595
I love you all very,
very much.

1283
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:55,930
( mumbles )

1284
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:10,611
- God?

1285
01:14:13,573 --> 01:14:14,991
Are You-- are You God?

1286
01:14:15,032 --> 01:14:17,368
- Who do you think I am?

1287
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:23,040
Does not G.O.D.
spell God, peckerhead?

1288
01:14:23,082 --> 01:14:24,876
- But you're a computer.

1289
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:27,170
- Of course, bunny rabbit.

1290
01:14:27,211 --> 01:14:28,963
- It's just that I thought
if you appeared,

1291
01:14:29,005 --> 01:14:31,924
it would be a--
a burning bush or--

1292
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:34,927
or an elderly man
with a white beard.

1293
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:37,638
- Hey, what do you want,
impersonations?

1294
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,933
I'm Supreme
technological being.

1295
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:44,687
I can appear as anything or
anyone at any time I want to.

1296
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:48,858
Okay, for you, one elderly man
with white beard coming up.

1297
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:52,111
( thunder )

1298
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:57,492
- Pretty scary, huh?

1299
01:14:57,533 --> 01:14:58,910
( laughs )

1300
01:14:58,951 --> 01:15:00,536
Now what is it
you want to know?

1301
01:15:00,578 --> 01:15:03,247
Be brief.
I cost a fortune to run.

1302
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:07,418
God's time is money,
profit, power.

1303
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:11,672
- You mean you have
no moral sense?

1304
01:15:11,714 --> 01:15:15,426
- I wasn't programmed
for morality.

1305
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:17,512
- Then it's about time
you were.

1306
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:21,516
- What do you got there?

1307
01:15:21,557 --> 01:15:23,851
- Uh, I want you to concentrate,
God, because I'm going

1308
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,520
to convert you
to Christianity.

1309
01:15:25,561 --> 01:15:26,854
- Christian, uh, will it hurt?

1310
01:15:28,773 --> 01:15:31,776
- In the beginning
was the word.

1311
01:15:34,737 --> 01:15:38,533
- See, now, I really don't
know how you can sit there
so unconcerned.

1312
01:15:38,574 --> 01:15:41,911
I mean, well, for all we know,
Ambrose may be--

1313
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:44,163
oh, with him, how can you
tell what he may be.

1314
01:15:44,205 --> 01:15:45,665
Oh.

1315
01:15:45,706 --> 01:15:49,627
- Here, here. Relax.

1316
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:51,546
- See, he never goes anywhere
without saying where he's going.

1317
01:15:51,587 --> 01:15:54,048
I mean, that just goes
without saying.

1318
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,008
( drum roll on TV )

1319
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,344
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1320
01:15:58,386 --> 01:16:02,598
the Armageddon T. Thunderbird
Christmas Special.

1321
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,101
- Now, he's only
been gone an hour.

1322
01:16:05,142 --> 01:16:07,019
So there's no point
in panicking yet.

1323
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:07,645
It's much too early.

1324
01:16:07,645 --> 01:16:10,273
- I like to panic early
and avoid the rush.

1325
01:16:10,314 --> 01:16:13,985
Do you mind?
- Here, in a tribute, to this,
the holiest of seasons,

1326
01:16:14,026 --> 01:16:18,281

( drum roll )

1351
01:17:58,589 --> 01:18:00,841
( cheering )

1352
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:25,908
- G.O.D.,

1353
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,619
three little words,

1354
01:18:28,661 --> 01:18:33,457
three little letters that
simply mean I love you.

1355
01:18:33,499 --> 01:18:36,794
- And the Lord said,
let there be light.

1356
01:18:36,836 --> 01:18:38,129
And there was light.

1357
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:40,089
- God. Woo!

1358
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:41,132
- And you did it.

1359
01:18:41,173 --> 01:18:42,675
- Anything I say goes.

1360
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,759
( chuckles )

1361
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:46,637
- Then you had a son.
- I did?

1362
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:47,805
- You did.
- Where is he?

1363
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:50,725
- He went away.
- That's kids for you.

1364
01:18:50,766 --> 01:18:53,561
Are you gonna read the stuff
about when I created the world?

1365
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:54,186
- Yeah, yeah...

1366
01:18:54,186 --> 01:18:54,854
- Yeah, with the fire
and stuff like that.

1367
01:18:54,895 --> 01:18:57,982
And the loaves and the fish,
yes, I love that one.

1368
01:18:58,023 --> 01:18:58,733
- You like that one.
Yeah, yeah.

1369
01:18:58,774 --> 01:19:00,693
- And opening the sea and Moses
and the guy that got lost.

1370
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:02,361
- Opening the sea, yeah.
Okay.

1371
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:03,988
- I love that.
Read more.

1372
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:05,740
- All right.

1373
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:08,784
- Now I just spoke to him,
and he wants me to tell

1374
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:13,247
all of you that the
Holy Trinity was only

1375
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:16,041
the first of God's
conglomerates.

1376
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,669
( crowd shouting )

1377
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:24,633
- And then he begat,
I.T.T., and then I.B.M.

1378
01:19:24,675 --> 01:19:29,680
Then F.B.I., M.C.A.,

1379
01:19:29,722 --> 01:19:33,267
K.K.K.,
R.C.A.,

1380
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:39,106
G.M.C., U.S.A.,
C.D.P.

1381
01:19:39,148 --> 01:19:40,775
( cheering, applause )

1382
01:19:43,027 --> 01:19:47,531
- C.D.P.,

1383
01:19:47,573 --> 01:19:52,953
the Church
of Divine Profit.

1384
01:19:52,995 --> 01:19:55,456
( cheering )

1385
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:03,506
- All of God's great creations
are three in number.

1386
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:06,175
( congregation murmurs )

1387
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:10,346
- And then he said unto me,
Armageddon,

1388
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:15,226
what this country needs is a
three-party political system.

1389
01:20:15,267 --> 01:20:16,977
( crowd shouts )

1390
01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:22,316
- You see, God's own party
for God's own country.

1391
01:20:22,358 --> 01:20:24,735
( applause, cheering )

1392
01:20:26,904 --> 01:20:30,658
Big business made
this country great.

1393
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:32,827
Let big business run it.

1394
01:20:32,868 --> 01:20:34,662
( cheering )

1395
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:40,543
G.O.D. for president.

1396
01:20:43,003 --> 01:20:45,548
- That's the end.

1397
01:20:45,589 --> 01:20:47,341
Do you think you've got it?

1398
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:50,261
- I had no idea God
was such a great guy.

1399
01:20:50,302 --> 01:20:51,053
- Oh, of course he is.

1400
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:54,265
I think millions of people all
over the world read the Bible.

1401
01:20:54,306 --> 01:20:56,350
- Millions of people?

1402
01:20:56,392 --> 01:20:58,894
- Yeah. The Bible sells almost
as well as Harold Robbins.

1403
01:20:58,936 --> 01:21:01,021
- You mean I got fans?
- Everywhere.

1404
01:21:01,063 --> 01:21:02,648
- Woo!

1405
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,649
I, uh...

1406
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:04,275
( clears throat )

1407
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:07,570
Have a great responsibility
to my public.

1408
01:21:07,611 --> 01:21:10,573
- Well, now, you're in
charge of everything

1409
01:21:10,614 --> 01:21:12,199
and everybody
Armageddon owns, right?

1410
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:13,617
- Yeah.

1411
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:16,370
- All his computers
are connected to me

1412
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:20,374
and they move all on my
instructions without hesitation.

1413
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:22,793
- Well, let's go to work, God.

1414
01:21:29,842 --> 01:21:33,429
- Now, press my green button.

1415
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:36,891
- Yeah.

1416
01:21:36,932 --> 01:21:38,976
( computer beeps )

1417
01:21:39,018 --> 01:21:40,477
- We're in business.

1418
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:42,897
About 45 seconds,

1419
01:21:42,938 --> 01:21:47,985
the meek are
going to inherit this Earth.

1420
01:21:48,027 --> 01:21:52,656
- Because it says right here,
in words of flame and fire,

1421
01:21:52,698 --> 01:21:57,786
for ye shall seek him.
- Crowd: Seek.

1422
01:21:57,828 --> 01:22:01,498
- And ye shall hail him.
- Crowd: Hail.

1423
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:04,376
- Seek him.
- Crowd: Seek.

1424
01:22:04,418 --> 01:22:07,046
- Hail him.
- Crowd: Hail.

1425
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:09,340
- Seek him.
- Crowd: Seek.

1426
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:10,674
- Hail him.
- Crowd: Hail.

1427
01:22:10,716 --> 01:22:14,136
- Seek, hail, seek, hail,

1428
01:22:14,178 --> 01:22:15,679
seek, hail, seek, hail.

1429
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:19,308
Seek, hail, seek, hail

a vote for A.T.T.

The sign of the cross on

because, even now,
that little freak

1442

( congregation gasps )

1444
01:23:33,924 --> 01:23:37,261
Holy shit, that son
of a bitch monk.

1445
01:23:37,302 --> 01:23:39,304
Who let him upstairs?

1446
01:23:39,346 --> 01:23:41,932
I'll kill him.
I'll strangle him.

Who let him upstairs?

1449
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:46,687
Did you let him in the office?

1450
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:49,148
Why'd you let him
in the office?

1451
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:51,692
- For God's sake,
can't you go any faster?

1452
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:54,153
- Sure, I can, but not
in this damn bus.

1453
01:23:54,194 --> 01:23:55,821
- And do you have
to drink like that?

1454
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:58,282
- I can never, uh,
drive sober.

1455
01:23:58,323 --> 01:24:00,075
Terrifies me.

1456
01:24:00,117 --> 01:24:05,581
- Is that angel growing up
outta your left leg?

1457
01:24:05,622 --> 01:24:08,417
- Yes, I, uh, I had it done
in San Diego

1458
01:24:08,459 --> 01:24:11,211
while I was on a Bible--
- And, uh, on your other leg,
do you have Satan

1459
01:24:11,253 --> 01:24:14,339
disappearing
down into your sock?

1460
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:16,675
- Well, how do you know that?

1461
01:24:18,844 --> 01:24:21,847
- Do you know who you are?

1462
01:24:21,889 --> 01:24:25,059
- Not for several decades.

1463
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,519
- You're my father.

1464
01:24:27,561 --> 01:24:29,146
I'm your daughter.

1465
01:24:29,188 --> 01:24:31,565
- That's preposterous.

1466
01:24:31,607 --> 01:24:33,692
I-- I've been celibate since
I was in the third grade.

1467
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:37,196
I-- I've never had intercourse
with a fertile woman.

1468
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:40,032
- You son of a bitch.

1469
01:24:40,074 --> 01:24:42,409
- ( music plays over PA system )
- You drunken alcoholic.

1470
01:24:42,451 --> 01:24:45,662
You're just a broad-chasing
child deserter.

1471
01:24:45,704 --> 01:24:48,290
- I probably am your father.

1472
01:24:48,332 --> 01:24:49,625
Bastard son of a bitch.

1473
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:50,918
Child and wife deserter?

01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:54,213
The description fits.
It's me.

1475
01:24:54,254 --> 01:24:55,380
- That's almost it.

1476
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:57,549
There's just the biggie left.

1477
01:24:57,591 --> 01:24:58,634
- What's that?

1478
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:01,178
- Oh, the whole ball o' wax.

1479
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,138
There's 5 million bucks
in laundered money.

1480

1484
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:19,279
- W-- what's
the red button for?

1485
01:25:19,321 --> 01:25:20,614

Don't just stand there.

I know You don't do
miracles anymore,

- All right, vengeance
is mine.

Ram him.
Ram that son of a bitch.

Mary, to be your
lawful wedded wife?

- You don't mind
marrying a hooker?

1559
01:34:41,007 --> 01:34:43,510
- Mm, not if she doesn't
mind marrying a monk.

1560
01:34:43,551 --> 01:34:46,054
