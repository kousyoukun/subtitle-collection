1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:03,186
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:05,693
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,786
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:14,964
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:19,707
<i>Michael Bluth had called a meeting...</i>

6
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,709
<i>with the family's longtime attorney...</i>

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,041
<i>to discuss his father's incarceration.</i>

8
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:28,811
I am so sorry.
It was a client. Okay.

9
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,409
<i>But he was finding it difficult
to get any answers.</i>

10
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:34,490
- How long was I on the phone?
- Twenty-five minutes.

11
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,754
With the cell phone charges,
I'm gonna round it out to about an hour...

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,590
'cause it's easier to bill...
all right.

13
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:43,996
<i>- Anything else to go over?
- We've got everything else to go over.</i>

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,558
We haven't done anything
to get my dad out of jail.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,539
Okay. First of all...
What are you doing? Pilates?

16
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:56,078
Because no 40-year-old woman
should look like that.

17
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,739
Well, no 40-year-old woman
does look like that.

18
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:01,715
<i>He was, however,
getting along with his sister...</i>

19
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,013
<i>which was unwelcome news
to their mother...</i>

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,486
<i>who feared this unity
might be used against her.</i>

21
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,489
<i>I do have some big news.</i>

22
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:10,786
It's going to cost you a little money...
20,000, something like that.

23
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:15,626
<i>The courts have agreed
to let your father out of prison.</i>

24
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,632
- This is a lawyer!
- He's a master!

25
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,827
For the entire afternoon.

26
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,427
What do you mean "afternoon"?
What afternoon?

27
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:25,803
<i>The day before Christmas,
in time for the Living Classics Pageant...</i>

28
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:28,103
because I know how important
that is to all of you.

29
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:30,645
<i>The Living Classics Pageant,
an Orange County tradition...</i>

30
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:34,308
<i>consists oflive representations
of classic works of art.</i>

31
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:37,113
<i>The Bluth family has participated
not only as a patron...</i>

32
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,383
<i>but as an integral part
of its most popular exhibit...</i>

33
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,119
<i>Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.</i>

34
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:46,320
I don't really want to be Adam this year.

35
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,761
Well, if you want to play Eve,
you got to get in line...

36
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:51,356
behind, what, about five homos.

37
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:56,395
That was wrong.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

38
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:58,838
<i>It's just that I have one
down at the office now...</i>

39
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,034
and, I mean, it is every day.

40
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:04,978
I would be happy to play Adam.
I'd prefer a speaking part...

41
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,073
Please don't speak for the rest of the meeting.

42
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:11,153
- Zing!
- No, no, seriously. I don't want to play Adam.

43
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:13,688
Buster, every year we go through
this song and dance...

44
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,352
and every year you say, "Thank you, Mama,
for making me play Adam."

45
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,225
<i>- You're doing it.
- This concerned Buster...</i>

46
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,662
<i>as he'd been secretly dating
his mother's best friend...</i>

47
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,758
<i>and chief social rival,
Lucille Austero.</i>

48
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:29,337
Can't we just stay here
and play poker again?

49
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,873
You can bet your vertigo medicine
against my anxiety pills.

50
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:35,535
No. Buster, for God's sake,
there is music to hear...

51
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:38,170
places to go, envy to stir.

52
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,079
Look, I'm tired of
keeping our love a secret.

53
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:43,778
We are going out,
and that is that!

54
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:46,787
- Oh.
- Oh, Buster. Okay, I'm okay.

55
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,720
<i>I'm okay.</i>

56
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,725
Okay. I'm gonna get out of your hair.

57
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:52,852
- We'll talk about this money later in the week.
- Excuse me.

58
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:55,988
We're not going to pay $20,000
to get my Dad out for one day.

59
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,466
No. It's a bond.
It's all refundable, unlike my time.

60
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,537
It's been a complete waste
of two hours, okay?

61
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:03,537
We're just not going to do it,
and that's that.

62
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,802
- Are you writing two hours?
- No, I'm taking notes on the case.

63
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,809
- Let me just see what you just wrote.
- You're scaring me.

64
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:13,439
just leave it alone! It is a gift from a client!
Ruining a good meeting.

65
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,643
- Barry's very good.
- He's an idiot.

66
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,653
Exactly. We're not trying
to get Dad out for a night.

67
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:20,655
We're trying
to get him out for good.

68
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:23,248
We're gonna get a new lawyer.
I actually know of one who's available.

69
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,259
His name's WayneJarvis.
He's a top guy.

70
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,420
<i>WayneJarvis had become famous...</i>

71
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,430
<i>after an employment
discrimination suit...</i>

72
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,467
<i>against the family's current attorney,
Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

73
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:35,799
It'll be a long time before Barry Zuckerkorn
calls anyone a homo again.

74
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:38,567
You know, I am really happy
that you two are in agreement...

75
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,801
but we're not getting rid of Barry.

76
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,902
He's like family,
and you can't fire family.

77
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,914
Yeah, I know.
Hey, Maeby.

78
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:49,348
<i>Maeby, where have you been?</i>

79
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,751
You left me at home.
You do remember you have a daughter, right?

80
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:54,948
Uh, yes, of course we remember...

81
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:56,957
and we were worried sick,
young lady.

82
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:01,587
She's fine. Our daughter's all right,
everybody, so...

83
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,689
<i>- You said you didn't want her to come.
- I said I didn't want you to come.</i>

84
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:08,464
- Oh, that makes more sense.
- Now she's going to think
we're totally self-involved.

85
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:11,768
I can fix this.
Buster's probably still in the lobby.

86
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:14,775
Let me go see if I can't get him
to give me the part of Adam.

87
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,607
<i>And I'll see if I can get some money
from my mom.
- Lupe!</i>

88
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,613
There are some juice glasses
on the sofa table.

89
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:21,706
<i>Mama, I'll help you clean up.</i>

90
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:23,615
There are some salad plates
on the piano.

91
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,586
Wow. What a party.
You make it seem so effortless.

92
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,680
What do you need money for?
A divorce?

93
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,487
No, Mom. Tobias and I
are doing fine, thank you.

94
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:33,721
- It's my credit card debt.
- Forget it.

95
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,627
Fine. I'll ask Michael.
He'll give it to me.

96
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:39,132
Maybe if you get him drunk.
It's the only way he'll give money...

97
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,136
to someone he calls
a "stay-in-bed mom."

98
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:45,867
- He said that about me?
- I thought it was harsh.

99
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:49,103
But, you know, he thinks
you're completely irresponsible.

100
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,840
A stay-in-bed mom.

101
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:55,213
Probably because you don't work,
and you're lazy.

102
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:57,149
His words.

103
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,653
<i>- I can't believe him.
- I know!</i>

104
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,724
just when you were
getting along so well.

105
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,590
They've got to be kidding me.

106
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,005
<i>Michael's brother Gob, meanwhile...</i>

107
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,203
<i>had missed the meeting that morning
after being delayed by his girlfriend Marta.</i>

108
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:23,007
<i>?: Te quiero!</i>

109
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,708
- English, please.
- I love you.

110
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,910
Great. Now I'm late.

111
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,351
<i>And while Gob
took his girlfriend for granted...</i>

112
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,117
<i>Michael was learning Spanish
to get closer to her.</i>

113
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:35,590
<i>That is not something I can bring to my boss.</i>

114
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:40,062
<i>Unfortunately, the one tape
he could find was oflittle use to him.</i>

115
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,064
<i>Are you going
to the complimentary breakfast?</i>

116
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,464
That'll get her hot.

117
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,538
Well, if it isn't the boy
who lives under the stairs.

118
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,539
- Hey, Gob.
- What are you doing, learning Spanish?

119
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:54,271
Nope. It's, uh... It's something for work,
so, yes, uh, yeah.

120
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:00,752
<i>Meanwhile, Buster
was trying to get George Michael...</i>

121
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,151
<i>Meanwhile, Buster
was trying to get George Michael...</i>

122
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,721
<i>to take his place as Adam.</i>

123
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,120
I don't know, Uncle Buster.

124
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,625
- Well, you don't have the "frontspiece" yet.
- "Frontspiece"?

125
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:14,391
Look, I don't want to go through a whole song
and dance with you. You're going to love it.

126
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,458
You just can't do anything that violates
the original painting, like giggling or itching.

127
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,266
They do allow some nervous crying,
but you can tell they don't like it.

128
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,469
<i>And Maeby was teaching
her parents a lesson for forgetting her...</i>

129
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:29,137
Who knows how long I'll be gone?

130
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,977
<i>when she spotted George Michael.</i>

131
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,847
Nice pecs. Got a kickin' bod.

132
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:38,753
<i>Thus, George Michael found a compelling
reason to keep the muscle suit on.</i>

133
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:42,992
Law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.

134
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,789
It's Michael Bluth for Barry.

135
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:48,627
- I'm not here.
- Barry's not here. Can I give her a message?

136
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,963
Tell her she needs to whisper
a little softer next time...

137
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,867
and I'm not paying
for this phone call.

138
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:56,668
I am not a girl, you bow-tied...

139
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:59,265
Go on. Call me something.
I'm redoing my kitchen.

140
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,312
That's it.
I've had it with this jerk Barry.

141
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:04,711
I'm going to make Mom sit down with Wayne
whether she likes it or not.

142
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:07,842
- You're the jerk.
- Did I just wake you up?
I didn't know you were home.

143
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:10,716
No, Michael, I don't just sleep all day.

144
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,722
<i>Actually, Lindsay was so upset at Michael...</i>

145
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:15,884
<i>that she tried meditating
to calm herself...</i>

146
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:18,758
<i>but ended up taking
a two-hour angry nap.</i>

147
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,024
Yeah, this suitcase
should be big enough.

148
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:24,295
Where is all this coming from?
I thought we were getting along.

149
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,166
Yeah, so did I. And now I hear
you're telling our mother...

150
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,798
that I'm completely irresponsible
and a stay-in-bed mom.

151
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,808
That doesn't even sound like me.

152
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,970
That sounds like Mom
or Bruce Vilanch.

153
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,378
- Could be Bruce Vilanch.
- Then why would she say it?

154
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,008
- Because we're getting along.
- Because we're friends again.

155
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,644
You gotta remember Mom
typically has nothing in her system...

156
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,746
except a bottle of vodka
and an estrogen pill.

157
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:48,052
Speaking of which...

158
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,491
<i>Michael and Lindsay proceeded to drink...</i>

159
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,495
<i>and air their grievances
about their mother.</i>

160
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,294
She's always trying to get me to admit
that my marriage isn't working.

161
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:59,165
- And how's it going with you and Tobias?
- It's not working.

162
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,501
And that's why I wanted her help
with my credit card debt.

163
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,337
I'm trying to take at least some of
the pressure off this marriage.

164
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,844
And if anything, it's worse
now that we're sharing a bedroom.

165
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,744
You guys were not
sharing a bedroom before?

166
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,181
Well, the cutoffs
aren't exactly a turn-on.

167
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,551
- What's the deal with the cutoffs?
- You've got to promise not to tell anyone this.

168
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:22,353
- Okay.
- He's a never-nude.

169
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,792
Is that exactly what it sounds like?

170
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:27,228
<i>Tobias suffered
a rare psychological affliction...</i>

171
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,925
<i>of never being able
to be completely naked.</i>

172
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:32,969
Excuse me.
Do these effectively hide my thunder?

173
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:37,007
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I need you to be
completely undressed.

174
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:40,134
I am completely undressed.

175
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:43,042
- I thought he just liked cutoffs.
- Me too.

176
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,547
What about you?
What's going on with your love life?

177
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,550
<i>Have you even met anyone
since your wife?</i>

178
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,553
That is the one subject
I am not eager to talk about, Lindsay.

179
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,919
I love Marta.

180
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,592
- Mom's housekeeper?
- Gob's girlfriend.

181
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,163
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:04,098
Listen. You're a great guy,
and if she doesn't see that...

183
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:07,330
- then someone else will.
- You know what else, Lindsay? You're great.

184
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:11,499
And I'm gonna move some money around
if it's gonna help you get out of debt.

185
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,008
- No, Michael.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:16,672
The hell with Mom. And here.
Mom's never gonna get between us again.

187
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,477
<i>The next day, Buster,
having pawned off playing Adam...</i>

188
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:23,554
<i>went to Lucille 2 to ask her out
for Christmas Eve.</i>

189
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:27,750
That is terrific 'cause I got
two tickets to the pageant!

190
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,590
My... My mother's going to be there.

191
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,596
<i>And George Michael was trying to pass...</i>

192
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,030
<i>- as a more muscular boy than he actually was.
- One hundred.</i>

193
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,102
One hundred?
I had you at 10.

194
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,797
I did some earlier in the day. It's a running total.
So what's with the suitcase?

195
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:44,602
It's a little test
to get my parents to notice me.

196
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,609
You ever get the feeling
like no one even sees you?

197
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,045
I've got a really good body, so... no.

198
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,276
Hey, gang. What you doing?

199
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,614
- Just packing up. Packing it on up.
- Uh-huh.

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,950
Listen, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

201
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,491
<i>- I'll leave you two alone here.
- Oh, no, George Michael, I meant you.</i>

202
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:04,152
Maeby, can we have the room?

203
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,858
So, as you know, I was hoping
to play Adam in this thing...

204
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:15,996
and I want you to know
that I am not threatened.

205
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:18,371
You know, I'd be happy
to let you play Adam.

206
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:20,569
Give me the suit.
Give me the suit.

207
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:24,341
I'm actually wearing it right now,
and I can't tell you why.

208
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,348
You're wearing it right now?

209
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,180
I have to wear it all the time.
You'd never understand.

210
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,654
Oh, please.
I'll never under...

211
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,523
I'll never understand...
that you can never be nude?

212
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,759
<i>I understand more than
you'll never know.</i>

213
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,177
Yikes.

214
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,713
<i>Michael finally arranged
a meeting with attorney WayneJarvis.</i>

215
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:59,715
Looking for a more professional approach
to our representation.

216
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:01,114
Well, I'm a professional.

217
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:04,211
- I'm serious, and I'm a professional.
- That's fantastic.

218
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,756
- So how long have you been practicing...
- I also don't like small talk.

219
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:10,190
I find that unprofessional.
Why should I be billing you for small talk...

220
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,194
when I'm enjoying it
as much as you are?

221
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,356
Then this must be a freebie
'cause I'm having a ball.

222
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,866
When you're ready
to get serious, give me a call.

223
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:22,429
No, no! No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm serious. I'm ready.

224
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,408
Good. If you retain my services,
I will get your father out of jail...

225
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,410
and we will be countersuing
before the end of the year.

226
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:31,208
We're gonna get this company's name
back to where it started.

227
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,875
- Or hopefully higher.
- I didn't say that. Don't hold me to that.

228
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,785
I won't, and I appreciate that
to a wonderful degree.

229
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:40,288
My mother is on her way up here...

230
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:44,088
and she's resistant
to the idea of hiring a new attorney.

231
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:46,663
If she even sees you,
she probably won't come in the room.

232
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:49,289
I shall duck behind the couch.

233
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,834
What a pro.

234
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:54,695
- Michael.
- Hi.

235
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,036
I need to get the money
to get your father out for the pageant.

236
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:01,578
Actually, that's not why
I called you here today, and I'm not doing that.

237
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,273
I gave that money to Lindsay
to pay off her credit card debt.

238
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:07,840
- What'd she do, get you drunk?
- No, we just, uh, well...

239
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:10,614
We did drink a little bit.
How'd you know that?

240
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:12,621
Because that's what
she said she'd do.

241
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:15,851
I said you wouldn't give her the money,
and she said, "He will if I get him drunk."

242
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,258
Probably because she thinks
you're a cheap bastard.

243
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,353
Oh. Her words.

244
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,432
She set me up?

245
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:27,266
All that stuff about her marital troubles
and Tobias being a never-nude?

246
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,273
A never-nude?
I thought he just liked cutoffs.

247
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,434
How do you treat somebody
in your own family like that...

248
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,913
lying and deceiving and saying anything
just to get your own way?

249
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,779
- So what did you want to see me about?
- Hmm?

250
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,446
Oh, um, there's a big bowl
of candy in my office.

251
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,285
<i>- Why don't you go eat it?
- WayneJarvis, attorney at law.</i>

252
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:51,725
I have a responsibility to tell you
that there is no candy in this office.

253
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,320
Lindsay.

254
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,370
- What are you doing here?
- I had to get away from Marta.

255
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:05,308
<i>If I have to smell another meal of fish,
rice and mango, I'm gonna kill somebody.</i>

256
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:08,972
- Now Michael's learning Spanish.
What's up with that?
- Oh, who knows?

257
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:10,982
He won't get your father
out of jail for a night.

258
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:13,644
<i>- He's bringing in a new attorney.
- New attorney?</i>

259
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:16,688
And he's learning Spanish?

260
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:18,780
He's hiding something.

261
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:21,519
And I intend to find out what it is.

262
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:25,222
Do yourself a favor.
Get him drunk.

263
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,496
Barry.

264
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,275
I see you're getting closer
to our attorney.

265
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:41,006
<i>Well, I just want you to know
that I won't be needing your help after all.</i>

266
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:45,813
My brother Michael came through
as he always does and as you never do.

267
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:49,877
Whatever it takes to get your relationship
with that never-nude back on track.

268
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:54,357
- Michael told you that?
- He couldn't wait to.

269
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,826
<i>And later,
while Michael was meeting with Wayne...</i>

270
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:00,262
My thing with Tobias was a secret
like you stealing your brother's girlfriend!

271
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:03,062
- I open up to you, and you run and tell Mommy!
- Excuse me.

272
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,034
Outside, please.
Thank you. Pardon us.

273
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:08,801
Like it all wasn't just lies to get me to pay
that debt. Isn't that why you got me drunk?

274
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,035
<i>- I got you drunk.
- Mom told me about your little plan.</i>

275
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:14,409
- What plan? I had a great time last night!
- So did I!

276
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:16,880
- Then why are we yelling at each other?
- Mom.

277
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:20,384
- Unbelievable.
- She did it again.

278
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:23,387
- All right. We've got to teach her a lesson.
- Hmm.

279
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:28,626
<i>Excuse me, Wayne, my sister and I were
outside having a business discussion...</i>

280
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,253
and we were wondering
if there's some sort of legal way...

281
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:34,094
that we can humiliate our mother.

282
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,566
Something shaming, something public.

283
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,832
I've used one adjective to describe myself.
What is it?

284
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,907
Professional.

285
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,581
So how are we going to screw Mom?

286
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,344
<i>- Maybe we can get Barry to help.
- Forget it.</i>

287
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:55,512
I think I was right about them all along.
You know Barry's taking Mom to the pageant?

288
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,350
- On a date?
- Yeah.

289
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:02,827
Ugh! If Dad could see her
on a date with Barry, he'd go crazy.

290
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:05,625
<i>Which would allow us to hire Wayne.</i>

291
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,526
How do you feel about staying in debt
just a little bit longer?

292
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:14,037
<i>So they decided to spend
the money Michael had promised Lindsay...</i>

293
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,167
<i>to get their father out for the pageant,
where he'd catch his wife with Barry.</i>

294
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:21,838
<i>Maeby, too, continued to try
to teach her parents a lesson.</i>

295
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:24,508
Okay, so I printed the fake airline ticket
from my computer.

296
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:28,109
If my parents miss this,
I really might go to South America.

297
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:30,781
- That says "Portugal."
- That's right.

298
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,020
<i>Maeby's parents didn't find the ticket,
but Gob did...</i>

299
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:37,027
"Portugal."

300
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,461
<i>which confirmed his suspicions.</i>

301
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,159
Gonna live it up down old
South America way, huh, Mikey?

302
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:45,567
<i>And Buster finally gave in
to Lucille 2's wishes.</i>

303
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:49,072
You ready to show me off
before God and the whole world?

304
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,370
It's not my dad's reaction
I'm worried about.

305
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:55,573
<i>And George Michael finally saw the painting
he was going to be re-creating.</i>

306
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:02,979
<i>And then what "frontspiece"meant.</i>

307
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:13,932
<i>George Sr. got his 24 hours of freedom
as the pageant finally began.</i>

308
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:17,764
You know, I saw you do this when I was a kid.
I was so impressed.

309
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,806
You know, you were
so still and godlike.

310
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:24,274
It was at that moment
that I knew I would be a dancer.

311
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,745
Glad I could make a difference.

312
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:30,509
<i>Michael and Lindsay searched the crowd
for their mother and Barry...</i>

313
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:34,074
<i>so they could revel in the public shaming
they had engineered.</i>

314
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:38,122
<i>- Mom, what the hell are you doing?
- But instead they found her with Wayne.</i>

315
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:40,124
I don't have to answer that.

316
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:42,387
I don't know which one of you
I'm more disappointed in.

317
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,520
No, it's Wayne. Wayne...

318
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,258
- I have needs. I am a man!
- Hey, watch...

319
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,130
What's the difference?
Your father doesn't care about me.

320
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:52,727
Barry tells me he's not even trying
to get out of prison.

321
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,602
- Mom, he's here. Dad's here.
- He's here?

322
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,040
- Yeah, he's here.
- Why did you do this?

323
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:00,476
<i>- We were trying to teach you a lesson.
- You idiots!</i>

324
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,708
- If he sees me with Wayne...
- We'll be stuck with Barry.

325
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:06,808
I shall duck behind
that little garbage car.

326
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:10,154
Guy's a pro.

327
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,156
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

328
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,988
<i>Michelangelo's
The Creation of Adam.</i>

329
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:18,291
<i>And George Michael made his debut...</i>

330
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:20,797
Hey, that's my... Yikes.

331
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,834
<i>breaking the pageant's cardinal rule.</i>

332
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,562
How dare he!

333
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,639
Oh, stop booing!
There's nothing wrong with it.

334
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,733
There are dozens of us. Dozens!

335
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,937
<i>Buster arrived with Lucille Austero...</i>

336
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:37,846
<i>and naturally assumed the yells of disgust
were directed toward him.</i>

337
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,077
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

338
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:42,347
Buster?

339
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:44,446
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

340
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:47,924
I'm sorry, Lucille.
Yeah. Lucille.

341
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,995
Ma, I'm sorry!

342
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:54,624
Man! That old lady has really
done a number on you, hasn't she?

343
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:59,200
<i>But George Michael wasn't
the only problem with the painting.</i>

344
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,933
- Where is God?
- There is no God!

345
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,111
There goes my credit card payment.

346
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,477
Dad! Dad!

347
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:11,550
Hey! Dad!

348
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,619
- Excuse me.
- Dad!

349
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,316
- Hey, Dad, get back here!
- No! I'm not going back!

350
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,325
Dad, come here!

351
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:25,386
- Dad!
- Michael, I'm onto you.

352
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:28,160
The Spanish lessons, the lawyer.

353
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:32,067
- If you're heading for Portugal, it's due south!
- What? No, it isn't.

354
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:34,833
Dad, you're not gonna outrun me
in that dress.

355
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,899
- Let go! For God's sakes,
I'm not even wearing a jock.
- Dad, are you going too?

356
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:45,179
No one is going to Portugal, you idiot!

357
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:48,549
Lindsay and I broke Dad out of jail for a day
to catch Mom on a date.

358
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:51,350
Your mother is on a date? Oh.

359
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:52,719
Dad!

360
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:56,158
Oh, oh.

361
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,890
<i>- Dad?
- And so, many in the Bluth family...</i>

362
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:01,933
<i>gathered together
for Christmas Eve... at prison.</i>

363
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,662
- Hey, where'd your muscle suit go?
- Wait. You knew?

364
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,169
Yeah.

365
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,206
I took it off.

366
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:13,077
You did?

367
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:19,317
You have made some
tremendous strides today.

368
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,013
Ever get the feeling
like you don't even matter?

369
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,386
Only when I'm around my children.

370
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:29,359
You reach a certain age, and you have
to practically scream to get noticed.

371
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:33,364
They turn you into a monster,
and then they call you one.

372
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,866
I don't think you're a monster.

373
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,868
And I think you're a lovely girl.

374
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,234
You know what?

375
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,739
I think you and I
ought to spend more time together.

376
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:44,969
Yeah.

377
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:49,773
- That'll drive them crazy.
- Exactly.

378
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:51,782
<i>And Michael was forced to, once again...</i>

379
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:54,352
<i>call in the counsel of Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

380
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:56,614
Thank you. Thank you
for coming down on Christmas Eve.

381
00:19:56,722 --> 00:20:00,055
Oh, it's like any other day,
except that I bill double.

382
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,286
<i>So, they're not filing charges.</i>

383
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:06,956
I got them to call your flee from justice
"religious expression."

384
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,830
- This is a lawyer.
- Yeah, he's... he's very good.

385
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:13,063
You're gonna have to forfeit that bond.
I was way off about that.

386
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,299
Thanks again, Mikey.

387
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:20,411
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

388
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,539
Are all the guys in here, you know...

389
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:26,447
Oh, no, no, no.
Not all of them.

390
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:29,919
Yeah. It's never the ones you hope.

391
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:34,653
- Hope?
- Think.

392
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,423
<i>- How'd it go?
- Well, the bad news is you're in debt again...</i>

393
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:41,125
and we never busted Mom,
and we're stuck with Barry.

394
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:45,431
The good news is we've been asked
never to participate in the pageant again.

395
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,531
- Well, at least we're still pals, huh?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:54,276
That's not really doing it for me this time.

397
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,280
Yeah.
