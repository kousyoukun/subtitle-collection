1
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,999
There it is.

2
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,134
- Real big.
- Mm.

3
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,439
Want to go in first?

4
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,908
- Really?
- l don't see why not.

5
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,183
Are you coming?

6
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,197
So?

7
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,100
So what?

8
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,937
So what do you-- what do you think?

9
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,807
You already know what l think.

10
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,845
l did it, Dad!

11
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,513
That's great.

12
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,959
__

13
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,329
Lou!

14
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,306
They're here!

15
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,011
- Dad, we don't have any milk.
- l know. I'm sorry.

16
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,214
l didn't realize
that no one in town delivers.

17
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:15,583
Hmm?

18
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,219
And you forgot Marmalade's litter box.

19
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:22,256
I'll go into town tomorrow,
and I'll pick one up.

20
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,557
Uhh!

21
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,428
Uhh!

22
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,697
No, thank you.

23
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,066
I'm finished.

24
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:40,107
We're finished.

25
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,480
Well...

26
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,117
girls don't like jerky.

27
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,553
Mm-mm.

28
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,121
For dinner.

29
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,223
Uhh!

30
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,377
You going to unpack tomorrow, hon?

31
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:19,280
How are you going to do this?

32
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,781
Do what?

33
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,952
Be our father.
You don't have much practice.

34
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,821
l guess, um...

35
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,990
l guess we'll find out.

36
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,464
What are you writing?

37
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,001
A letter to Mom.

38
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,071
''Thanks for abandoning us.
You're a slut,

39
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,774
and your new boyfriend is a shit head.''

40
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,245
Well...

41
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:57,417
l agree with, uh, the second part.

42
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,188
Did you ever even love her?

43
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,924
Excuse me?

44
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,593
You didn't do anything. You let her go.

45
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:09,196
She made a decision, Louisa, okay?
l couldn't stop her.

46
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,198
But if you cared enough, you would have.

47
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,634
There was nothing l could do, honey.

48
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,969
And your mother--

49
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,705
your mother isn't a slut.

50
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,006
Fine.

51
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:22,376
l don't want you using that word anymore.

52
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,611
Fine.

53
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,113
Fine.

54
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,426
Can l come in?

55
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,794
Mm-hmm.

56
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,666
Wow.

57
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,136
You, uh...

58
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,306
you really did some work in here.

59
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:53,674
All by myself.

60
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,376
Yeah. All by yourself.

61
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,313
That's great. Thank you.

62
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,649
Louisa doesn't like it here.

63
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,151
Yeah.

64
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,322
What about you?

65
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,758
l like it if you like it.

66
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,496
l think it'll be good for us.

67
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:18,666
Is Mommy going to visit?

68
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,106
Maybe, if she saw
how much work l did unpacking,

69
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,607
she might.

70
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,613
Maybe you'll see her for Christmas.

71
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,949
- Okay? Good night.
- Good night.

72
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,456
Daddy?

73
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,724
Daddy!

74
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,359
Yeah?

75
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,729
You have to leave the door open a little.

76
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:49,863
Oh.

77
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,867
Sorry.

78
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,904
Daddy's, uh, forgetting a lot lately, huh?

79
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,143
- Good night.
- Good night.

80
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,780
You excited about
your first day of school tomorrow?

81
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,482
Yep.

82
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,350
You going to have some fun?

83
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:18,452
Yep.

84
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,320
Yeah. Good.

85
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:24,858
Well, good morning.

86
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,360
l couldn't sleep.

87
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,464
It was too quiet, and it was too dark.

88
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,865
This place sucks.

89
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,402
Please don't use that word.

90
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,939
- Doesn't mean what you think.
- l know what it means.

91
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:42,809
Okay, then really, don't use it.

92
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,018
What does sucks mean?

93
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,510
John, how are the children?

94
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,313
They're missing their mom,
but we're doing okay.

95
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:23,150
l hope there will be
a good therapist there.

96
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,284
Yeah.

97
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,219
You never know
when your daughter needs one.

98
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:29,256
Yeah, I'd say we're all
staring at some therapy.

99
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:31,291
Well, anyway, how's the book coming?

100
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,892
When are we going to see some changes?

101
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,061
- The writing?
-Yeah.

102
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,763
Well, the writing's, uh...
the writing's coming great.

103
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,765
- Yeah, John?
- Yeah, it's coming great.

104
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,168
l think I've already got
the first couple of chapters done.

105
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:55,649
How about l call you in a couple of weeks
when l have something to show you?

106
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,117
- Sounds good, John.
- Good.

107
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,618
Bye.

108
00:11:58,686 --> 00:11:59,953
Huh.

109
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,134
- Sam!
- l just found it.

110
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,336
Sam, put that down!

111
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,271
- Louisa--
- Daddy!

112
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,840
Daddy!

113
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,509
Sam, put that down.

114
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,644
Louisa, l just found it.

115
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:25,946
Sam!

116
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,017
Point that at the ground.

117
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,886
l need for you
to listen to me very carefully.

118
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,154
Louisa, come on.

119
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,323
l-- l was playing the piano.

120
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,825
l want you to bend your knees, Sam.

121
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,527
l want you to bend your knees

122
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,965
and gently, gently lay that on the ground.

123
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,633
- It was in there.

124
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,534
Sam, that's all right.

125
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,437
- That's okay.
- I'm going to tell--

126
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,973
Everything's all right.
You're not in trouble.

127
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,143
l want you to gently hand it to me.

128
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,546
l--

129
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,320
All right, all right. Hey. Hey.

130
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,793
Am l grounded?

131
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,228
Hmm?

132
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,029
Am l grounded?

133
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:19,466
No. You're not grounded.

134
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:25,372
And even if you were, Sam,
it wouldn't make any deference.

135
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,642
We're a hundred miles
from anyone you know.

136
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,843
Not now.

137
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,416
What are you going to do with it?

138
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,153
Want to let me worry about that?

139
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,854
Okay.

140
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:45,091
Come on, Sam. Let's go exploring.

141
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,095
Where?

142
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,531
Everywhere.

143
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,738
Come on.

144
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,713
Wait up, Lou.

145
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,788
- Oh!
- Be careful.

146
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,695
What the fuck?

147
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,230
- Look at that.
- Whoa!

148
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:50,624
Hey, it was loaded, all right?
It was loaded.

149
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:51,758
Okay, John.

150
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,059
Nobody got hurt, right?
l am sorry about that.

151
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,797
l thought you might want to,
you know, contact the seller,

152
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,565
let him know that he left a piano
loaded with a shotgun

153
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,434
for my T-year-old to find.

154
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,737
- Wow. You got a piano.
- Yeah.

155
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,070
right. Well, thank you, John.

156
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,274
Okay, Stewart. Thank you very much.

157
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,775
l am sorry about all this.

158
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,681
Putz.

159
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,720
- Lou?
- Yeah.

160
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,789
Does Mommy not love us anymore?

161
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,291
No, Sam. Mom still loves us.

162
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,795
Did l do something?

163
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,262
No.

164
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,931
Did Daddy?

165
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,836
No.

166
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,672
What is that, Lou?

167
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,342
l don't know.

168
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,612
Louisa?

169
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,889
Dad.

170
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,624
We found something.

171
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,266
Are you coming?

172
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,401
Yep.

173
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,903
It-- It's outside.

174
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,137
Yeah? We going to need jackets?

175
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,451
What is it, Daddy?

176
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,690
l don't know.

177
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:40,060
The realtor never said
anything about it.

178
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:43,296
Doesn't seem to be any sign
of a tractor dig or--

179
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,498
Feels old.

180
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,835
Sam, come up here.
l can almost see my window.

181
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,175
It's all right.

182
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,743
Come on.

183
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,248
No.

184
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:04,351
l-- l don't want to.

185
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,620
Whatever.

186
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,956
Okay.

187
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,991
You can walk with me.
l don't want to go up there, either.

188
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,755
Marmalade. Marmalade.

189
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,424
Oh.

190
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,696
Marmalade.

191
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,048
Marmalade?

192
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,418
Marmalade.

193
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,706
Here, Sam.

194
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,775
- What's that?
- Lunch.

195
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:21,514
You forgot to do it.
You were too busy losing Marmalade.

196
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,282
I'll find her.

197
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,150
- John James?
- Yes.

198
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,420
I'm Cassandra Parker.
We spoke on the phone.

199
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,957
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

200
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,059
You must be Louisa.

201
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,527
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:39,699
You are going to be in classroom T
with Mr. Anderson.

203
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,901
- You're Sam, right?
- Uh-huh.

204
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:46,339
You're going to be in my class,
number 4.

205
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,442
Why don't you two follow
the rest of the kids inside?

206
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,410
Sure.

207
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,713
- I'll see you at 3?
- All right.

208
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,250
Do l have to go?

209
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:06,192
Can you give it a chance for me, Sam?

210
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:10,363
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

211
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,204
How did you know who l was?

212
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,473
Oh. It's a small town.

213
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,210
l know most of the parents and kids.

214
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:29,948
But, uh, l read your book,
Lines of fire, twice.

215
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,350
I'm kind of a fan.

216
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,620
Is that weird?
Should l have not said anything?

217
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:38,324
No. No. It's always better
to meet a fan than a critic.

218
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,425
You're not perfect.

219
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,729
It was nice meeting you.

220
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,798
Nice meeting you.

221
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,914
You're in my seat.

222
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,550
Sorry.

223
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:05,652
l don't want it now.

224
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,421
Do l? You put your ass on it.

225
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,492
Oh, what? Is little baby going to cry?

226
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,409
Did you find everything all right today?

227
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,744
Mm-hmm.

228
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,347
So are you visiting? On vacation?

229
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,582
No, we just moved here
and bought a house.

230
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:40,286
Oh, well, welcome to Mercy.

231
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,555
Thank you. l can barely believe it myself.

232
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,791
You buy that house on Bacon Street?

233
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:51,231
No, we're-- we're of, uh, we're of 38
up a dirt road called Red Creek.

234
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:52,365
Really?

235
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,999
Pam.

236
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,107
Ooh, uh, what is it?

237
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,943
It's nothing.

238
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,845
Really, man, it's nothing.

239
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,518
Okay, okay.

240
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,020
Really what?

241
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:17,857
it's nothing.
It's just stupid local stories.

242
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,325
Rumors, really.

243
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,259
- Rumors?
- Pam.

244
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,329
What about that woman?

245
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,163
Sarah Wayne? And her daughter?

246
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:28,200
Dear God, Pam,
enough with the gossip.

247
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,871
Anything else for you?

248
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,040
No, this is it.

249
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:38,344
And most of the ants inside these farms
are harvest ants,

250
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,845
but they have a nickname.
Does anyone know what that is?

251
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,649
- Yes.
- Beard ants.

252
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:45,652
Bearded ants. That's right.
And why is that?

253
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,187
Because they have tiny beards.

254
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,855
That's right.
They have tiny little beards.

255
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,557
They're kind of hard to see, though.

256
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:56,895
Now, there is, also, inside here
a queen ant.

257
00:24:56,963 --> 00:25:02,568
A queen ant spends a lot of time
building all these tunnels,

258
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:06,238
and she finds a nice soft spot
where she can lay her eggs.

259
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:09,275
And after she does,
she pretty much stays there.

260
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,711
Marmalade!

261
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,116
Kitty!

262
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,223
Oh, God.

263
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,065
Uh--

264
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,735
I've been learning about all
deferent kinds of ants.

265
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,171
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

266
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,840
There's the army ants that never
stay in one place for too long.

267
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,076
- Yeah?
- And then there's these kinds of ants

268
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,677
that stay in their colony forever,

269
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,247
only to send out a scout
to look for food and stuff.

270
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,748
- Mm-hmm.
- There's only one girl ant

271
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,784
in the whole family. She's the queen ant.

272
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,786
- The grownup.
- And she's in charge.

273
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,456
What else did you do?

274
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,157
Well, after we all got ant farms,

275
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:36,762
me, Steven, and George played ping pong
during lunch for, like, hours.

276
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,332
- Miss Parker's really nice.

277
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,200
What about you? What did you--

278
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,669
What did you do?

279
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,206
What's wrong with her?

280
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,875
l don't know.

281
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:56,816
Is little baby going to cry?

282
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,552
Mm!

283
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,932
Aah! God.

284
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,741
Mm.

285
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:40,420
Son of a bitch.

286
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,776
Louisa?

287
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:10,817
Sam?

288
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:11,949
Daddy?

289
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:17,590
Have you, uh,

290
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,290
have you seen Louisa?

291
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,828
Did you find Marmalade yet?

292
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,798
No, l haven't.

293
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:31,170
l haven't found Marmalade yet, honey.

294
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:34,473
Were you playing outside?

295
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,875
Mm-mm.

296
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,683
Uh, bedtime soon, okay?

297
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,150
Okay.

298
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,029
Louisa?

299
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:05,471
Louisa, is everything all right?

300
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,343
Louisa!

301
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:13,479
Yeah?

302
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,584
Were you just, uh...

303
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,886
Were you just outside?

304
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,187
I'm in the bathtub.

305
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:25,658
Are you all right?

306
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,758
Yes.

307
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:29,928
Okay.

308
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,867
Okay, but just-- next time,

309
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,335
just be back home before it gets dark.

310
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,813
Louisa, you, uh--

311
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,349
I'm coming.

312
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,357
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

313
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,867
Come here, baby.

314
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:17,556
Daddy?

315
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,926
We have to go to school.

316
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,495
Oh. Okay.

317
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,332
Louisa.

318
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,003
God damn it.

319
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,370
What happened?

320
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,173
I'm sorry.

321
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:41,947
Honey, we're going to be late.

322
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:44,750
I'm ready.

323
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,493
Sam, where's your backpack?

324
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:57,930
My room.

325
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,163
Go get it.

326
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,401
Uh, when--

327
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,004
when did you, um...

328
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,642
Are you hungry?

329
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:11,110
No.

330
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:17,415
How did you, uh, sleep last night?

331
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,052
Fine.

332
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,020
You don't remember sleepwalking?

333
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,290
l had to put you back in your bed.

334
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,459
Well, did you take Molly?

335
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,427
What?

336
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:32,231
My doll. Molly.

337
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,066
l woke up this morning,
and l couldn't find her.

338
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,536
No, l-- l didn't take Molly, but l did--

339
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,839
l did find this.

340
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:47,045
- What's that?
- l don't know. You tell me.

341
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,581
Did you, uh-- Did you make this?

342
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,583
l don't know what that is.

343
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,552
You were holding it last night.

344
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,059
I'm ready.

345
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,362
Let's go, Sam.

346
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:06,765
Come on, Dad.

347
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,968
And his grades are much better this year.

348
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:13,572
l can really tell that he's
been picking up a lot.

349
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,275
l can see all the work that you've
been doing on his reading and--

350
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,545
Good morning.

351
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,925
Louisa!

352
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,604
Hey, you.

353
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,173
Are you hiding from me?

354
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,218
You're scared, aren't you?

355
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:11,456
What is wrong with you?

356
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,459
Are you deaf?

357
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,294
Say something.

358
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,391
- Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,295
Where's Louisa?

360
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,230
She's resting in the nurse's office.

361
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,469
We had another girl slip and fall.

362
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,702
Broke an arm.

363
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

364
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,054
How are you feeling?

365
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,090
- l don't feel good.
- Yeah?

366
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:56,227
After l called you,
she threw up a few more times.

367
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,763
My stomach hurts.

368
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:00,332
All right, let's go home.

369
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,033
Can you walk,
or do you want me to carry you?

370
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:05,504
- Carry me.
- Okay.

371
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,944
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

372
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,782
It's okay, honey.
You're going to feel better soon.

373
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,654
It's a tough age for girls.

374
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,291
Hormones, puberty...boys.

375
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:31,195
- It can be tough on fathers, too.
- Yes, it can.

376
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,931
She's, uh...

377
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:35,966
They both had it rough for a while.

378
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:38,971
My-- My wife and l just got divorced,

379
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:41,707
so now with this move, it's just--

380
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,008
it's a lot for them to take in.

381
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:45,677
They might surprise you, though.

382
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:50,280
Kids have a way of coping with change,
sometimes better than adults.

383
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,382
Yeah.

384
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,652
And I've had experience
with adopted children,

385
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,487
- and they in no way--
- What?

386
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,322
Adopted?

387
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,457
Louisa's told me that she--

388
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,128
Oh.

389
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,566
Louisa said that she was--

390
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,233
- Yeah.
- ...adopted?

391
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,237
Yeah. And with her dark hair,
as opposed to yours and Sam's--

392
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,739
- She-- She takes after her mom.
- Right.

393
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,343
Sorry.

394
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,746
Here.

395
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,349
My home phone number,

396
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:29,019
in case you ever need someone to talk to.

397
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:34,325
Thanks. l, uh, l better get going.

398
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

399
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,690
Aah!

400
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,662
Aah!

401
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,930
l told you l want you home
before it gets dark, honey.

402
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,270
Louisa.

403
00:43:30,142 --> 00:43:32,611
We need to talk.

404
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,945
It's okay. l get it, all right? l get it.

405
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,949
You're not a child anymore.
You're changing.

406
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,517
And l know, all right?

407
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,820
l know l got a lot to learn
about being a parent,

408
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:44,455
but l promise--

409
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:47,658
l promise you I'm doing the best l can.

410
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,229
lf this move doesn't work for you
and you hate it--

411
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,698
l don't hate it, Dad.

412
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,066
No?

413
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,468
No.

414
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,420
Honey, what's this?
Where did you get these?

415
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,689
Don't touch me.

416
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,755
Hey, l was just--

417
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,925
Why do you always have to ruin everything?

418
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,727
- Honey, l was just--
- Just leave me alone.

419
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,594
l just want to see if you're all right.

420
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:22,313
Uhh!

421
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:15,265
l went to San Francisco on a signing tour,

422
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,669
and a week later, when l got back
to, uh, Charleston,

423
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:23,941
she'd already hired a divorce attorney
and-- -- filed papers.

424
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,843
- Wow.
- Yeah.

425
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,345
So sudden doesn't really cover it.

426
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:30,782
No.

427
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,583
So...

428
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:35,053
how did you end up with the kids?

429
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:42,294
That's the part
that l still don't understand yet.

430
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,295
l mean, my wife, uh--

431
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:49,734
my-- my ex-wife Isabel,
she wanted to start a family.

432
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,070
She wanted us to move to Charleston
so we could be ne_ to her parents,

433
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:57,140
and then, all of a sudden, she, uh...

434
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,411
she didn't want anything to do with us.

435
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,883
And now I'm, uh, I'm here,

436
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,752
and l know this is the most important
thing that I've ever done.

437
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,788
l know that, and it--

438
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,291
and it scares me...

439
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,827
more than anything.

440
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:35,846
John, you're not going to fail them.

441
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,681
You're doing a great job.

442
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,785
Oh, yeah. I'm doing great, you know.
I'm doing really great.

443
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,953
l don't even know who Louisa--

444
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,988
l don't even know who Louisa is anymore.

445
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,924
One minute she's my, uh, my little girl,

446
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:50,928
and then the next minute
she's telling me to go, you know,

447
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,596
screw myself.

448
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,800
You want to know what l think?

449
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,635
l do.

450
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:04,675
l think you're probably a lot stronger
than you give yourself credit for.

451
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,281
Thank you.

452
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,175
Louisa?

453
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,888
Louisa, is that you?

454
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,523
Honey?

455
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:55,253
Louisa.

456
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,112
Uhh!

457
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,870
- Dad.
- Go inside.

458
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:50,107
What happened? Dad?
Is everything okay?

459
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:52,309
- Just go inside.
- Daddy.

460
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,281
Were you just outside?

461
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,783
No.

462
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,457
l don't want you playing
out in the fields anymore, honey.

463
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,794
l don't want you
playing out on the mound.

464
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:13,164
So you take me away
from all of my friends,

465
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,764
- and now l can't even go outside?
- Louisa--

466
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,201
Look, l don't care.

467
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,212
What's wrong?

468
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,747
All my ants are dying.

469
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,884
l think it got too hot.

470
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:09,586
Or maybe it got too cold.

471
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,689
Did l kill them?

472
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,294
Well, ants usually don't live
that long anyway, honey,

473
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,765
and remember what you were saying
about there only being one girl ant?

474
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:22,867
You know, the queen?

475
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:25,303
Do you think she died?

476
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,970
They can't live without her.

477
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:30,374
Usually, before one queen dies,
another one is born, and--

478
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,742
See, there's, uh--

479
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,412
See? There's still some
moving around in there.

480
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:38,081
We'll just-- We'll just have to
wait and see, honey.

481
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,050
What happens
if the queen dies before then?

482
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,453
Well, l don't--
Honey, l don't think that she will.

483
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,721
But what if she does?

484
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,389
Sam, I've got to go talk
to somebody, okay?

485
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:48,592
Can you watch some cartoons?

486
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:01,304
Could it have been a kid throwing rocks?

487
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,472
No.

488
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,842
Well...

489
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,445
l don't know, then.

490
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,782
We don't get anything out here
bigger than a pig.

491
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,086
Former owners
never mentioned anything.

492
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:19,289
All they ever asked about
was that old Indian burial mound.

493
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,827
Is that what that is?

494
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:27,031
Oh, l don't know.

495
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,966
Probably.

496
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,335
Was that the only thing
you wanted to talk about?

497
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,803
No, l wanted to talk to you
about the sale of the house

498
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,106
and the woman that went missing--
Sarah Wayne.

499
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,809
- What?
- Sarah Wayne.

500
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,277
She lived here with her daughter.

501
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:41,678
l read about it.

502
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:42,779
- Right.
- Right.

503
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,647
- About that--
- And when l bought the house,

504
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,651
you told me that the seller
was Roger Wayne.

505
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:50,153
Yeah. No. He was the seller, John.

506
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,488
- He was co-signer on Sarah's loan.
- Right.

507
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,557
When she disappeared,
he became the heir.

508
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,193
You never told me anything about this.

509
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,062
Well, there was no crime committed.

510
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:03,000
Okay? It was just assumed
that Sarah couldn't' t make payments,

511
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:04,067
so she bolted.

512
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,036
Yeah, but she left her 16-year-old
daughter, Stew.

513
00:55:06,104 --> 00:55:08,239
You don't think that was
an important piece of information?

514
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,073
- Oh, come on.
- If not a little strange?

515
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:13,911
Look, John, the world is full
of deadbeat parents. Hmm?

516
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,919
You're going to love this.

517
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,155
What did you find?

518
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,023
You have to see.

519
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,502
What's up there, Lou?

520
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,205
After Sarah disappeared,

521
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,375
Roger took his granddaughter
Emily away.

522
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,776
Where?

523
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,378
l don't-- A suburb of Charleston.

524
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,182
Suburb of Charleston. Okay.

525
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:54,084
Anything else?

526
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,455
And there was a house fire,

527
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,690
and the girl died.

528
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:07,063
There was a house fire,
and the girl died,

529
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:09,399
And you never told me
anything about this.

530
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,901
It doesn't have anything
to do with you, John.

531
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:15,205
You're going to give me the address
of the house that burned, Stewart,

532
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:18,041
and then I'm going to find
this Roger Wayne.

533
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:22,313
l have to know if my family is safe.

534
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,214
Louisa?

535
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,151
Louisa?

536
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,792
Lou?

537
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,800
Seven stitches, Lou.

538
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,270
Seven stitches.
What in the world were you thinking?

539
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,239
l didn't even scare him
He just let go of the ladder.

540
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:53,476
You're his older sister.
You're supposed to look out for him.

541
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:54,911
Sorry.

542
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,316
And he said you were
out at the mound again.

543
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,284
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

544
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,586
Yes? Well, what did l tell you?

545
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:06,189
- Well, you don't let me do anything.
- You--

546
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,427
You just sit here and wait.

547
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,295
You understand me?

548
00:57:14,299 --> 00:57:16,000
We'll be going home soon.

549
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,944
- Hello.
- Hi.

550
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,479
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

551
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,047
Oh, no problem at all.

552
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,984
Cassandra Parker has given you
a glowing recommendation.

553
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:35,318
Oh, that was nice of her.

554
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,619
Please, uh, come in.

555
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,824
- This is Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

556
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,460
Hi.

557
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:46,329
My daughter Louisa's upstairs, okay?

558
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:50,166
I'm only going to be gone
four or five hours, all right?

559
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:51,535
Okay.

560
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,336
So if I'm delayed for any reason,
I'll call you.

561
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,937
- All right.
- Okay?

562
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:58,842
You'll be good? Yeah? You'll be okay?

563
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,577
- Big boy?
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,679
- Hmm? All right? Okay.
- Okay.

565
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:06,082
Um, one more thing.

566
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,185
Louisa is, uh, grounded.

567
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:10,420
She likes to play out in the fields
in the back,

568
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,655
but she's not allowed to right now.

569
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:14,157
I'll make sure she doesn't.

570
00:58:14,225 --> 00:58:16,560
Okay. Be good.

571
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,862
Professor Evan White's office.

572
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:53,996
Yeah, this is John.

573
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,699
Hello, Mr. James.
We just got your email.

574
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:57,767
Listen--

575
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,368
- It's very interesting.
- Yeah.

576
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:01,237
The professor's looking at your photos.

577
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:02,639
Listen, l really--

578
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,274
- Evan, it's our writer.
- What?

579
00:59:04,342 --> 00:59:05,876
The one with the mound.

580
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,077
- Evan.
- Okay, I'll be--

581
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,279
Evan!

582
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,009
Sam.

583
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,312
What?

584
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,482
Come play with me.

585
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,227
Where?

586
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,428
The mound.

587
01:00:32,497 --> 01:00:35,132
We're not supposed to, Lou.

588
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,638
We're not supposed to, Lou.

589
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,442
Aah!

590
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,612
- Get out!
- Okay.

591
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,515
- This is my house! Get out!
- All right.

592
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,618
- You're not wanted here.
- Wait.

593
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:09,852
- Get out!
- Roger Wayne?

594
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,690
Oh. I'm sorry. Are you--

595
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:17,060
Are you Roger Wayne?

596
01:03:19,664 --> 01:03:22,199
What did you say?

597
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,569
l was going to get rid of that house.

598
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:29,373
Did you ever go out there?

599
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:34,677
Just once. l hadn't heard from Sarah
in over three weeks.

600
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,780
l was worried. l drove down.

601
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,415
She was gone.

602
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,885
And Emily--

603
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:49,392
l heard about your...granddaughter.

604
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,561
You live there now?

605
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:52,830
Yeah.

606
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,399
Have any children?

607
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:59,836
Yeah. A boy and a girl.

608
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,176
She changing?

609
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:08,678
What?

610
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:11,914
Your daughter, is she changing?

611
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:18,087
Emily changed.

612
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:21,692
What do you mean?

613
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:26,395
When l went out to that house,
l found her locked in the bedroom.

614
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:30,133
From the outside.
Sarah had locked her in there.

615
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,136
What are you talking about?

616
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:38,941
l brought Emily back to the city,
but she was sick.

617
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,677
Something inside of her had changed.

618
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:45,049
One night l woke up. It was pouring rain.

619
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,883
l went to check on her.

620
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:51,387
She wasn't in bed.

621
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:55,791
l found her in the backyard,
covered in mud

622
01:04:55,859 --> 01:05:01,297
and digging in the ground
with her hands.

623
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:08,804
She wasn't really awake,
but she wasn't really asleep, either.

624
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,776
She didn't even seem to notice,

625
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,045
and l thank God for that.

626
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:20,950
When l picked her up
and brought her inside...

627
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,488
l started the fire.

628
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,029
What?

629
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,834
She wasn't my granddaughter anymore.

630
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:41,337
l had to do it. So will you.

631
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:45,274
Wait a minute. You started the fire?

632
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:49,111
My Sarah couldn't do
what needed to be done.

633
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:53,149
That's why she locked Emily
in the bedroom.

634
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:57,787
A father will do anything for his daughter,
even the worst thing.

635
01:05:58,823 --> 01:06:00,057
Even the worst thing!

636
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:06,028
Taking her away from that place
did nothing!

637
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,897
You can't stop it!

638
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:18,507
Good night, Sam. Sweet dreams.

639
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:20,143
Good night, Mrs. Amworth.

640
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:28,684
Oh. Oh, Louisa, you scared me.

641
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,354
Have you been outside?

642
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:35,591
You'll definitely have to have a bath
before bed, so go wash up.

643
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,159
Look at you. You have--

644
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,799
- Damn it.

645
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,869
Sam? Louisa?

646
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,239
Open the door, please.

647
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,173
Open the door!

648
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,275
Sam!

649
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,778
- Open the door.

650
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,215
- Open the door.

651
01:08:40,985 --> 01:08:42,820
Louisa?

652
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:47,322
Louisa, open the door.
For God's sake, open the door!

653
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,525
Oh, Jesus!

654
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,460
Louisa!

655
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,528
Louisa!

656
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,999
- Louisa! Louisa!

657
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,671
- Please help me!

658
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,667
Mrs. Amworth?

659
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,014
Louisa.

660
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,091
Sam?

661
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,696
Sam?

662
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,099
Sam, are you in there?

663
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,069
Sam?

664
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,072
Sam!

665
01:10:21,085 --> 01:10:23,954
Sam. Are you all right?

666
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,589
Sam, are you okay?

667
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,792
What's wrong?

668
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,228
Huh?

669
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:35,598
Hey. What's wrong?

670
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,133
What's wrong?

671
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:41,070
l heard screaming.

672
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,775
Louisa.

673
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,113
Louisa, wake up. Wake up.

674
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,181
- Daddy.
- Where's Mrs. Amworth?

675
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,018
- What?
- Mrs. Amworth, the babysitter.

676
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,519
Where is she?

677
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:58,921
l don't know.

678
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,904
So l just went to bed.

679
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:19,975
Um, l woke up when my dad
came into my room.

680
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,277
And you didn't hear anyone screaming?

681
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:24,613
Mm-mm.

682
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:31,620
You, Sam, you said
you heard the sound of screams, right?

683
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,855
l heard her.

684
01:11:35,558 --> 01:11:37,493
It was scary.

685
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,298
Okay.

686
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,301
Ms. Parker.

687
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,174
Maybe it's not too far down the road.

688
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,408
Yeah. Yeah.

689
01:11:56,512 --> 01:12:00,082
So, uh, what happens now?

690
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,985
Well, I'm going to take a ride
over to Evelyn's.

691
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:07,289
Hopefully, she's just left and gone home.

692
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,558
That wouldn't be like Evelyn at all.

693
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:14,130
You'll call me
as soon as you hear everything?

694
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:19,335
l will. In fact, Mr. James,
make sure you stay where l can reach you.

695
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,539
Good evening.

696
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:32,048
Do you want me to stay?

697
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:38,220
Better not.

698
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,456
I'll call you tomorrow.

699
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,458
Okay.

700
01:12:53,269 --> 01:12:55,838
Your girlfriend's not staying over?

701
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,373
No.

702
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,275
Don't you want her to?

703
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:04,747
Cassandra's going home,
and it's time for bed.

704
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:07,483
Why, because you say so?

705
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,119
Yes, Louisa. Because l say so.

706
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:12,087
I'm the father. You're the daughter.

707
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,756
Well, you don't know
how to be a fath--

708
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,581
Daddy.

709
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:42,151
I'm so cold.

710
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,088
It's okay.

711
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,590
Everything's going to be okay.

712
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,761
Are you going to leave me?

713
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,931
No. No.

714
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,433
I'm not going to leave you.

715
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:00,035
But Mommy left.

716
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,771
Why did Mommy leave?

717
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,650
You'll leave me, too, won't you?

718
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:16,151
Louisa.

719
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,324
I'll never leave you.

720
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,901
You have to try and rest, okay?

721
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,122
Daddy.

722
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,127
Can l sleep with you tonight?

723
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,124
Daddy!

724
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,676
I'm your new daughter.

725
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,842
All right, get your stuff.

726
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,177
I'll be right here
when you guys get out, okay?

727
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:30,379
Okay, Daddy. Bye.

728
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:38,219
Have you heard from the police yet?

729
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,188
- Yeah.
- And?

730
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:41,890
And there's still no sign of her.

731
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:47,196
She's going to turn up, Cassandra.
She has to.

732
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:48,330
Can you--

733
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,068
Can you keep an eye on Louisa for me?

734
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,703
Absolutely.

735
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,338
All right. Thank you.

736
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,550
Oh, no.

737
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,254
Ohh...

738
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,761
- Rick?
- Yeah.

739
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,897
I'm taking the mound down today.

740
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,299
These things can be tricky.

741
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:00,068
Maybe these things can be tricky.
l don't care.

742
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,570
Many root systems go down pretty deep.

743
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:05,606
- Yeah, l--
- You have to get way below surface.

744
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:07,307
- l don't--
- bring the diesel--

745
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,977
- Listen to me.
- Ammonium nitrate--

746
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,912
- Rick, look.
- Yeah.

747
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,083
Get that bulldozer up here
as soon as possible, all right?

748
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,917
- Sure, Mr. James.
- Thank you.

749
01:19:33,701 --> 01:19:35,803
- Yeah?
- Mr. James,

750
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,106
this is Evan White from
the University of Charleston.

751
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:39,207
Hello, Professor.

752
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,476
I've taken a look at the photos
of your property.

753
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,177
- I'm very intrigued.
- Well, actually, um--

754
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:46,047
Would it be possible for me to come
down there today and take a look?

755
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,549
l do appreciate you taking the time,

756
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,017
but there's been a change of plan.

757
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:52,120
I'm actually going to be
taking the mound down today.

758
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,022
Could you at least wait
until we get there?

759
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,825
l can't talk about this anymore.
It's something l have to do today.

760
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:58,026
- Please--
- Thank you very much.

761
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,360
Mr. James, please--

762
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:17,846
This baby's going to blow.

763
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:39,868
Don't stop.

764
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,574
Hello?

765
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:50,446
Professor Evan White.
We spoke on the phone.

766
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,846
Oh, that's right.

767
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:53,782
Look.

768
01:20:53,848 --> 01:20:55,783
Alexis Danella.

769
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:58,719
- I'm the professor's .
- Hello.

770
01:20:58,786 --> 01:21:02,523
Mr. James, an excavation
wouldn't take much time,

771
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,226
and ritualized mound burial--

772
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:09,131
its study, it's important.

773
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:11,266
No, I'm doing this today.

774
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:14,469
What a waste.

775
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:18,107
Mr. James, mound burial is something

776
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:21,576
that links many civilizations
all across the globe.

777
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,778
I'm sorry.

778
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,547
This wants to be studied.

779
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,884
Hey, how come
they bury their dead like this?

780
01:21:29,952 --> 01:21:31,787
Mostly, they didn't.

781
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,655
Mound burial
was only for the most revered

782
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,626
because, at least in some cases,
the mounds themselves were worshiped.

783
01:21:38,694 --> 01:21:41,663
We found some evidence
in a limestone cave in Mississippi.

784
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,900
There's drawings
that might depict a mythology

785
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:49,104
of the gods that existed
inside the mounds.

786
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,439
Inside?

787
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:53,842
They called them mound walkers.

788
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:55,309
Mounds were places of power,

789
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:58,747
and the walkers were believed to be
a dying race of deities,

790
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:00,915
weakened over thousands of years

791
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:02,784
by the encroachment of humans
onto their land.

792
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,484
Rick, go on.

793
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:07,289
I've even found depictions of a ritual,

794
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:10,025
an exchanging of gifts
between the walkers

795
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:13,028
and children of some of the native tribes.

796
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,364
Dolls?

797
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,504
Well...

798
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:24,272
Straw dolls?

799
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,040
Yes, that's right. Um...

800
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,945
- how did you know that? l haven't--

801
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:33,181
Rick, wait.

802
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,559
What did they want?

803
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,495
What any species wants-- to survive.

804
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:51,633
So, when faced with extinction,
the gods themselves began to pray.

805
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,802
Pray for what?

806
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:57,371
A savior, a chosen one.

807
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,074
And she would come
from the unlikeliest of places.

808
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,676
She would be human--

809
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:05,547
...young girl--

810
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,084
and then the mating ritual would begin.

811
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:15,657
The myth was that the walkers
were an all-male race.

812
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,927
They needed a mother, a queen,
to give birth to the ne_ life's eggs.

813
01:23:18,993 --> 01:23:22,096
And then a new age would begin.

814
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,004
Mr. James--

815
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,405
Do it now!

816
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,618
Mr. James, please.

817
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:50,225
Aah!

818
01:23:57,132 --> 01:24:01,069
I've had officers combing for blood
in and around your house all day.

819
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,037
My-- My house? Look, l didn't--

820
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,372
Hey, l didn't do this.

821
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,275
Okay. All right.

822
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:09,210
I'd like to believe that,

823
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:13,315
but we're going to do this right.

824
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,585
But you're going to have to be
helpful and patient.

825
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:17,686
Understand?

826
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:22,657
Can l at least call my kids
at their school?

827
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,459
l called Cassandra Parker already.

828
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,927
She, uh...

829
01:24:25,993 --> 01:24:29,096
She's going to take your kids home
and stay with them.

830
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,600
Look, l promised my kids
that l would pick them up.

831
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:33,835
l understand that.

832
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,171
But I'm just going to need you
to stay here for a little while, all right?

833
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:40,809
lf your, uh, story checks out,
you're going to be with them soon enough.

834
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,510
l give you my word, okay?

835
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,388
My ants are dead.

836
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:56,691
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Sam?

837
01:25:01,028 --> 01:25:02,996
My ants are dead.

838
01:25:05,968 --> 01:25:07,669
Those are eggs.

839
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:11,139
Daddy was right.

840
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,641
There's a new queen.

841
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:16,411
Look how all the other ants
are surrounding her,

842
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:20,915
guarding her until it's done.

843
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:25,287
What's wrong, Sam?
Are you all right?

844
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:31,660
l think something bad
is going to happen now.

845
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:35,664
Nothing bad is going to happen. Hmm?

846
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:43,638
There's something wrong with Louisa.

847
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:49,411
Hello?

848
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,780
- Hello, Ed?
- No, this is John.

849
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:54,683
It's Skinner from the lab
for Officer Lowry.

850
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:59,354
Hold on. I'm with Officer Lowry.
Let me put you on the speaker.

851
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:04,192
Ed, hi. Look, we did a preliminary
autopsy on the body,

852
01:26:04,258 --> 01:26:06,793
and it appears she was eaten alive.

853
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,397
- What could have done that?
- Ed, we're not sure.

854
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,032
The bite marks don't match
any known creatures,

855
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:14,901
and really, we've never seen
anything like this.

856
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,571
Shit!

857
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:20,275
What the--

858
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,577
Ed, are you there?

859
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:24,445
Look, we're going to have to call you back.

860
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,716
- Ed?
- Jesus Christ, l think l hit someone.

861
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:30,919
No. Where are you going?
No, no, no. Stay in the car.

862
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,435
What happened to the light?

863
01:26:55,142 --> 01:26:56,810
Come on.

864
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,815
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Hey!

865
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,556
Oh, my God!

866
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:43,825
Cassandra!

867
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,194
Sam!

868
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:51,999
Louisa!

869
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:12,954
God.

870
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,690
Oh. Cassandra.

871
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:26,234
Louisa. What happened?

872
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,314
Daddy!

873
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:41,715
Sam?

874
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:44,685
Sam?

875
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:51,059
Daddy!

876
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:56,264
It's okay, Sam. It's okay.
We're going home now.

877
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:57,831
She won't let us.

878
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:01,736
We're leaving, Louisa.

879
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:03,838
No.

880
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:05,773
We're not.

881
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,643
Louisa, listen to me.
Please, honey, just--

882
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:11,746
Louisa, just come--

883
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:25,259
Okay. Don't move. You don't move.

884
01:29:50,517 --> 01:29:52,018
I'm going down there with them.

885
01:29:52,087 --> 01:29:54,355
lf you go somewhere, l can't follow you.

886
01:29:54,421 --> 01:29:56,189
You will follow.

887
01:29:56,258 --> 01:29:57,726
- Shut up!

888
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:58,792
Shut up.

889
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,262
- Please.

890
01:31:43,497 --> 01:31:44,531
Louisa!

891
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,373
Daddy!

892
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,950
Don't move, Sam.

893
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:17,298
Daddy!

894
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,373
No, Daddy!

895
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,715
Daddy! Daddy!

896
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:37,819
Please, no!

897
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:42,289
Daddy--

898
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:43,591
Daddy.

899
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:47,295
Don't! Please, Daddy!

900
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:50,431
Don't!

901
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:54,935
Sam, you need to wait here, okay?

902
01:32:55,003 --> 01:32:57,572
Wait here until the police come.

903
01:32:57,638 --> 01:32:58,805
Here.

904
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,942
Where are you going?

905
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:10,284
Tell the police to call Mommy, okay?

906
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:11,852
Dad.

907
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:16,690
l love you, Sam, okay?

908
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:26,267
Okay. You want your monkey?

909
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:29,303
Your monkey will be safe with you, okay?

910
01:33:30,305 --> 01:33:31,939
You be a big boy.

911
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:33,207
You be a big boy.

912
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:25,026
Be a big boy.

913
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:51,204
Come on.

914
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:05,045
Louisa?

915
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:11,752
Louisa.

916
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:16,757
Louisa.

917
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:23,497
Daddy?

918
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:25,632
Louisa.

919
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,134

920
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,834
Yes, l will take you.

921
01:38:29,903 --> 01:38:31,137
Take you out of here.

922
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,890
Okay. We're almost home,
but you're going to have to pull yourself.

923
01:39:22,956 --> 01:39:24,791
You're going to have to push.

924
01:39:28,496 --> 01:39:29,496
Hurry.

925
01:40:11,873 --> 01:40:13,441
