171
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,561
for my 7-year-old to find.

172
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,863
<i>- Wow. You got a piano.
- Yeah.</i>

173
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,197
<i>All right. Well, thank you, John.</i>

174
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,397
Okay, Stewart. Thank you very much.

175
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,905
<i>I am sorry about all this.</i>

176
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,807
Putz.

177
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,850
- Lou?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,910
Does Mommy not love us anymore?

179
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:26,423
No, Sam. Mom still loves us.

180
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,925
Did I do something?

181
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,392
No.

182
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,053
Did Daddy?

183
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,966
No.

184
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,674
[creature growling]

185
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,796
What is that, Lou?

186
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,466
I don't know.

187
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:52,737
Louisa?

188
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:02,080
[clock ticking]

189
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,018
Dad.

190
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,749
We found something.

191
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,389
Are you coming?

192
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,523
Yep.

193
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,033
It... It's outside.

194
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,262
Yeah? We going to need jackets?

195
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,575
What is it, Daddy?

196
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:36,818
I don't know.

197
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:40,187
The realtor never said
anything about it.

198
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:43,421
Doesn't seem to be any sign
of a tractor dig or...

199
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,621
[Louisa]
Feels old.

200
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:49,962
Sam, come up here.
I can almost see my window.

201
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,301
It's all right.

202
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,863
Come on.

203
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,373
No.

204
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,472
I... I don't want to.

205
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,747
Whatever.

206
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,084
Okay.

207
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:13,123
You can walk with me.
I don't want to go up there, either.

208
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,330
[scraping]

211
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,885
Marmalade. Marmalade.

00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,546
Oh.

[roaring in distance]

214
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,819
Marmalade.

215
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,171
Marmalade?

216
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,237
[grumbling in distance]

217
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:19,546
Marmalade.

218
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,831
Here, Sam.

219
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,896
- What's that?
- Lunch.

220
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:21,638
You forgot to do it.
You were too busy losing Marmalade.

221
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:23,407
I'll find her.

222
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:25,278
- John James?
- Yes.

223
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:28,546
I'm Cassandra Parker.
We spoke on the phone.

224
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,087
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

225
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,180
You must be Louisa.

226
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,656
- Hi.
- Hi.

227
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:39,822
You are going to be in classroom 7
with Mr. Anderson.

228
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:42,024
- You're Sam, right?
- Uh-huh.

229
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:46,468
You're going to be in my class,
number 4.

230
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:49,563
Why don't you two follow
the rest of the kids inside?

231
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,540
Sure.

232
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,839
- I'll see you at 3?
- All right.

233
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:58,379
Do I have to go?

234
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:06,322
Can you give it a chance for me, Sam?

235
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,483
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

236
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,325
How did you know who I was?

237
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:21,599
Oh. It's a small town.

238
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:24,334
I know most of the parents and kids.

239
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:30,074
<i>But, uh, I read your book,
Lines of Fire, twice.</i>

240
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,478
I'm kind of a fan.

241
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,745
Is that weird?
Should I have not said anything?

242
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:38,448
No. No. It's always better
to meet a fan than a critic.

243
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:40,547
You're not perfect.

244
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:41,921
[bell rings]

245
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:43,857
It was nice meeting you.

246
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:45,919
Nice meeting you.

247
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,326
[chatter]

248
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,040
You're in my seat.

249
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,671
Sorry.

250
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,773
[laughs]
I don't want it now.

251
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,546
Do I? You put your ass on it.

252
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:13,623
Oh, what? Is little baby going to cry?

253
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,540
Did you find everything all right today?

254
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:32,871
Mm-hmm.

255
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:35,468
So are you visiting? On vacation?

256
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:37,707
No, we just moved here
and bought a house.

257
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,410
Oh, well, welcome to Mercy.

258
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:43,681
Thank you. I can barely believe it myself.

259
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:45,915
You buy that house on Bacon Street?

260
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,360
No, we're... we're off, uh, we're off 38
up a dirt road called Red Creek.

261
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,487
Really?

262
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,121
Pam.

263
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:02,228
Ooh, uh, what is it?

264
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,069
[Man]
It's nothing.

265
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:05,972
Really, man, it's nothing.

266
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:13,640
Okay, okay. [laughing]

267
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,150
Really what?

268
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:17,983
it's nothing.
It's just stupid local stories.

269
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,454
Rumors, really.

270
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,388
- Rumors?
- Pam.

271
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,450
What about that woman?

272
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:25,290
Sarah Wayne? And her daughter?

273
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:28,331
Dear God, Pam,
enough with the gossip.

274
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,995
Anything else for you?

275
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,162
No, this is it.

276
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:38,470
And most of the ants inside these farms
are harvest ants,

277
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,976
but they have a nickname.
Does anyone know what that is?

278
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:42,774
- Yes.
- Beard ants.

279
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:45,782
Bearded ants. That's right.
And why is that?

280
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,317
Because they have tiny beards.

281
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:49,978
That's right.
They have tiny little beards.

282
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,681
They're kind of hard to see, though.

283
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:57,022
Now, there is, also, inside here
a queen ant.

284
00:24:57,094 --> 00:25:02,691
A queen ant spends a lot of time
building all these tunnels,

285
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:06,361
and she finds a nice soft spot
where she can lay her eggs.

286
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,406
And after she does,
she pretty much stays there.

287
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,841
Marmalade!

288
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,244
Kitty!

289
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,346
Oh, God.

290
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,196
Uh...

291
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:09,858
[Sam] I've been learning about
all different kinds of ants.

292
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,299
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

293
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:14,963
There's the army ants that never
stay in one place for too long.

294
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,200
- Yeah?
- And then there's these kinds of ants

295
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:18,798
that stay in their colony forever,

296
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,367
only to send out a scout
to look for food and stuff.

297
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:22,878
- Mm-hmm.
- There's only one girl ant

298
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:24,915
in the whole family. She's the queen ant.

299
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,916
- The grownup.
- And she's in charge.

300
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,580
What else did you do?

301
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:33,282
Well, after we all got ant farms,

302
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:36,884
me, Steven, and George played ping pong
during lunch for, like, hours.

303
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,452
- Miss Parker's really nice.
- [John chuckles]

304
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,327
What about you? What did you...

305
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,796
What did you do?

306
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:48,329
[Sam]
What's wrong with her?

307
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:49,997
I don't know.

308
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:56,947
Is little baby going to cry?

309
00:26:58,582 --> 00:26:59,674
Mm!

Mm.

Sam?

319
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:12,072
Daddy?

320
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,712
Have you, uh,

321
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,415
have you seen Louisa?

322
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,952
Did you find Marmalade yet?

323
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:26,922
No, I haven't.

324
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:31,299
I haven't found Marmalade yet, honey.

325
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:34,599
Were you playing outside?

326
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:37,003
Mm-mm.

327
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:43,804
Uh, bedtime soon, okay?

328
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,280
Okay.

329
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,158
Louisa?

[doorknob rattles]

00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,601

Yeah?

335
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,712
Were you just, uh...

336
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:21,012
Were you just outside?

Yes.

340
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,056
Okay.

341
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:34,992
Okay, but just... next time,

342
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:37,465
just be back home before it gets dark.

What happened?

360
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,298
I'm sorry.

00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:42,068
Honey, we're going to be late.

I'm ready.

363
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:55,621
Sam, where's your backpack?

364
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,057
My room.

365
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,288
Go get it.

366
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:03,530
Uh, when...

367
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,125
when did you, um...

368
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,766
Are you hungry?

369
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,239
No.

370
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:17,545
How did you, uh, sleep last night?

371
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:20,174
Fine.

372
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,151
You don't remember sleepwalking?

373
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,415
I had to put you back in your bed.

374
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:27,582
Well, did you take Molly?

375
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:29,557
What?

376
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:32,356
My doll. Molly.

377
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:35,193
I woke up this morning,
and I couldn't find her.

378
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:38,666
No, I... I didn't take Molly, but I did...

379
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:41,964
I did find this.

380
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,173
- What's that?
- I don't know. You tell me.

381
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,712
Did you, uh... Did you make this?

382
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,713
I don't know what that is.

383
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,683
You were holding it last night.

384
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:01,181
I'm ready.

Come on, Dad.

387
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:10,095
And his grades are much better this year.

388
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,694
I can really tell that he's
been picking up a lot.

389
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,399
I can see all the work that you've
been doing on his reading and...

390
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:19,666
Good morning.

00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:11,579
What is wrong with you?

00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:14,590
Are you deaf?

399
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:16,421

00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:26,359
She's resting in the nurse's office.

406
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,591
We had another girl slip and fall.

407
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:31,827
Broke an arm.

408
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,843
- Hey.
- Hey.

409
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:50,182
How are you feeling?

410
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,221
- I don't feel good.
- Yeah?

411
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:56,349
After I called you,
she threw up a few more times.

412
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:58,894
My stomach hurts.

413
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:00,452
All right, let's go home.

414
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,158
Can you walk,
or do you want me to carry you?

415
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,633
- Carry me.
- Okay.

416
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:13,072
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

417
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,905
It's okay, honey.
You're going to feel better soon.

418
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,782
It's a tough age for girls.

419
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:27,414
Hormones, puberty... boys.

420
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,325
- It can be tough on fathers, too.
- Yes, it can.

She's, uh...

422
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,091
They both had it rough for a while.

423
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,101
My... My wife and I just got divorced,

424
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:41,831
so now with this move, it's just...

425
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:44,135
it's a lot for them to take in.

426
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:45,799
They might surprise you, though.

427
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:50,403
Kids have a way of coping with change,
sometimes better than adults.

428
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,504
Yeah.

429
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:54,778
And I've had experience
with adopted children,

430
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,614
- and they in no way...
- What?

431
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:58,449

00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:04,258
Oh.

434
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,695
Louisa said that she was...

435
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:09,356
- Yeah.
...adopted?

436
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:12,367
Yeah. And with her dark hair,
as opposed to yours and Sam's...

437
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:14,869
- She... She takes after her mom.
- Right.

438
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:18,470
Sorry. [chuckling]

439

00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:34,452
Thanks. I, uh, I better get going.

We need to talk.

It's okay. I get it, all right? I get it.

You're changing.

And I know, all right?

454
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,947
I know I got a lot to learn
about being a parent,

but I promise...

456
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:47,782
I promise you I'm doing the best I can.

Uhh!

00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:15,392
I went to San Francisco on a signing tour,

470
00:47:15,464 --> 00:47:18,797
and a week later, when I got back
to, uh, Charleston,

471
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:24,067
she'd already hired a divorce attorney
and... [chuckles]... filed papers.

472
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,971
- Wow.

476
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,182
how did you end up with the kids?

477
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:42,416
That's the part
that I still don't understand yet.

478
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:44,425
I mean, my wife, uh...

479
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:49,863
my... my ex-wife Isabel,
she wanted to start a family.

480
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:54,198
She wanted us to move to Charleston
so we could be next to her parents,

481
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:57,262
and then, all of a sudden, she, uh...

482
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,537
she didn't want anything to do with us.

483
00:48:02,345 --> 00:48:06,008
And now I'm, uh, I'm here,

484
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:08,880
and I know this is the most important
thing that I've ever done.

485
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:11,920
I know that, and it...

486
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:14,422
and it scares me...

487
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,958
more than anything.

488
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:35,971
John, you're not going to fail them.

You're doing a great job.

Oh, yeah. I'm doing great, you know.
I'm doing really great.

and then the next minute
she's telling me to go, you know,

I do.

498

than you give yourself credit for.

- Go inside.

00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:50,232
What happened? Dad?
Is everything okay?

518
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,433
- Just go inside.
- Daddy.

519
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:58,406
Were you just outside?

520
00:51:58,481 --> 00:51:59,914
No.

521
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:06,581
I don't want you playing
out in the fields anymore, honey.

522
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:10,924
I don't want you
playing out on the mound.

523
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:13,291
So you take me away
from all of my friends,

524
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:14,886
- and now I can't even go outside?
- Louisa...

525
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:16,329
Look, I don't care.

526
00:53:00,142 --> 00:53:01,336
What's wrong?

527
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,878
All my ants are dying.

528
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:08,012
I think it got too hot.

529
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,710
Or maybe it got too cold.

530
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,812
Did I kill them?

531
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:18,420
Well, ants usually don't live
that long anyway, honey,

532
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:21,895
and remember what you were saying
about there only being one girl ant?

533
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:22,988
You know, the queen?

534
00:53:23,065 --> 00:53:25,431
Do you think she died?

535
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:27,093
They can't live without her.

536
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:30,502
Usually, before one queen dies,
another one is born, and...

537
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:31,870
See, there's, uh...

538
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:34,535
See? There's still some
moving around in there.

539
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:38,205
We'll just... We'll just have to
wait and see, honey.

540
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,181
What happens
if the queen dies before then?

541
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,582
Well, I don't...
Honey, I don't think that she will.

542
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:44,846
But what if she does?

543
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,512
Sam, I've got to go talk
to somebody, okay?

544
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,716
Can you watch some cartoons?

545
00:53:58,434 --> 00:54:01,426
Could it have been a kid throwing rocks?

546
00:54:01,503 --> 00:54:02,595
No.

547
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:05,967
Well...

548
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:09,567
I don't know, then.

549
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,910
We don't get anything out here
bigger than a pig.

550
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,214
Former owners
never mentioned anything.

551
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:19,413
All they ever asked about
was that old Indian burial mound.

552
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:23,957
Is that what that is?

553
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:27,154
Oh, I don't know.

554
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:29,094
Probably.

555
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:31,462
Was that the only thing
you wanted to talk about?

556
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,933
No, I wanted to talk to you
about the sale of the house

557
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,233
and the woman that went missing...
Sarah Wayne.

558
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:38,938
- What?
- Sarah Wayne.

559
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:40,407
She lived here with her daughter.

560
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:41,807
I read about it.

561
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:42,901
- Right.
- Right.

562
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:44,775
- About that...
- And when I bought the house,

563
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:47,782
you told me that the seller
was Roger Wayne.

564
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,284
Yeah. No. He was the seller, John.

565
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:52,616
- He was co-signer on Sarah's loan.
- Right.

566
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:54,679
When she disappeared,
he became the heir.

567
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:56,315
You never told me anything about this.

568
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:59,190
Well, there was no crime committed.

569
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:03,129
Okay? It was just assumed
that Sarah couldn't make payments,

570
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:04,187
so she bolted.

571
00:55:04,266 --> 00:55:06,166
Yeah, but she left her 16-year-old
daughter, Stew.

572
00:55:06,235 --> 00:55:08,362
You don't think that was
an important piece of information?

573
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:10,200
- Oh, come on.
- If not a little strange?

574
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:14,038
Look, John, the world is full
of deadbeat parents. Hmm?

575
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:23,040
You're going to love this.

576
00:55:23,118 --> 00:55:25,279
What did you find?

577
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:27,151
You have to see.

578
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:39,624
What's up there, Lou?

579
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:42,330
After Sarah disappeared,

580
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:45,498
Roger took his granddaughter
Emily away.

581
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:46,905
Where?

582
00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:49,500
I don't... A suburb of Charleston.

583
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:52,308
Suburb of Charleston. Okay.

584
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,212
Anything else?

585
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:58,584
And there was a house fire,

586
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:00,815
and the girl died.

587
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,188
There was a house fire,
and the girl died,

588
00:56:07,262 --> 00:56:09,526
And you never told me
anything about this.

589
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:12,032
It doesn't have anything
to do with you, John.

590
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:15,332
You're going to give me the address
of the house that burned, Stewart,

591
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:18,168
and then I'm going to find
this Roger Wayne.

592
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,438
I have to know if my family is safe.

593
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:24,342

594
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:28,277

598
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:47,400
Seven stitches.
What in the world were you thinking?

599
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:50,370
I didn't even scare him
He just let go of the ladder.

600
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:53,602
You're his older sister.
You're supposed to look out for him.

601
00:56:53,675 --> 00:56:55,040
Sorry.

602
00:56:57,312 --> 00:56:59,439
And he said you were
out at the mound again.

603
00:56:59,515 --> 00:57:01,415
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

604
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:03,713
Yes? Well, what did I tell you?

605
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:06,311
- Well, you don't let me do anything.
- You...

606
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,550
You just sit here and wait.

607
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,423
You understand me?

608
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,125
We'll be going home soon.

- Hi.

Thanks for coming on such short notice.

00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:31,168
Oh, no problem at all.

612

Cassandra Parker has given you
a glowing recommendation.

613

Oh, that was nice of her.

Hi.

617
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:46,457
My daughter Louisa's upstairs, okay?

618
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:50,294
I'm only going to be gone
four or five hours, all right?

619
00:57:50,365 --> 00:57:51,662
Okay.

620
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:53,462
So if I'm delayed for any reason,
I'll call you.

621
00:57:53,535 --> 00:57:55,059
- All right.
- Okay?

622
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:58,971
You'll be good? Yeah? You'll be okay?

- Big boy?
- Mm-hmm.

624
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:02,801
- Hmm? All right? Okay.
- Okay.

625
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:06,211
Um, one more thing.

626
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:08,306
Louisa is, uh, grounded.

627
00:58:08,383 --> 00:58:10,544
She likes to play out in the fields
in the back,

628
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:12,780
but she's not allowed to right now.

629
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:14,288
I'll make sure she doesn't.

630
00:58:14,356 --> 00:58:16,688
Okay. Be good.

Did you ever go out there?

Just once. I hadn't heard from Sarah
in over three weeks.

I was worried. I drove down.

666
01:03:37,979 --> 01:03:39,537
She was gone.

667
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:43,010
And Emily...

668
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:49,517
I heard about your... granddaughter.

669
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:51,684
You live there now?

670
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,954
Yeah.

671
01:03:54,663 --> 01:03:56,528
Have any children?

672
01:03:56,598 --> 01:03:59,965
Yeah. A boy and a girl.

673
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:06,299
She changing?

674
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:08,808
What?

675
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:12,040
Your daughter, is she changing?

676
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:18,209
Emily changed.

677
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,823
What do you mean?

678
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:26,520
When I went out to that house,
I found her locked in the bedroom.

679
01:04:26,595 --> 01:04:30,258
From the outside.
Sarah had locked her in there.

680
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,261
What are you talking about?

681
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:39,066
I brought Emily back to the city,
but she was sick.

682
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,802
Something inside of her had changed.

683
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:45,176
One night I woke up. It was pouring rain.

684
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:47,010
I went to check on her.

685
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:51,519
She wasn't in bed.

686
01:04:51,586 --> 01:04:55,920
I found her in the backyard,
covered in mud

687
01:04:55,991 --> 01:05:01,429
and digging in the ground
with her hands.

688
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:08,925
She wasn't really awake,
but she wasn't really asleep, either.

689
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:13,907
She didn't even seem to notice,

690
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:16,170
and I thank God for that.

691
01:05:16,244 --> 01:05:21,079
When I picked her up
and brought her inside...

692
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:25,613
I started the fire.

693
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,151
What?

694
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:38,956
She wasn't my granddaughter anymore.

695
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:41,468
I had to do it. So will you.

696
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:45,404
Wait a minute. You started the fire?

697
01:05:45,473 --> 01:05:49,239
My Sarah couldn't do
what needed to be done.

698
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:53,270
That's why she locked Emily
in the bedroom.

699
01:05:53,348 --> 01:05:57,910
A father will do anything for his daughter,
even the worst thing.

700
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:00,182
Even the worst thing!

701
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:06,159
Taking her away from that place
did nothing!

702
01:06:06,227 --> 01:06:09,025
You can't stop it!

703
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:18,635
Good night, Sam. Sweet dreams.

704
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:20,265
Good night, Mrs. Amworth.

705
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,809
Oh. Oh, Louisa, you scared me.

706
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:32,478
Have you been outside?

707
01:06:32,554 --> 01:06:35,717
You'll definitely have to have a bath
before bed, so go wash up.

708
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,280
Look at you. You have...

Sam? Louisa?

715
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:29,366
Open the door, please.

716
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:31,302
Open the door!
[knocking]

717
01:08:31,372 --> 01:08:33,397

718
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:36,909
- Open the door.

01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:42,947
Louisa?

721
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:47,454
Louisa, open the door.
For God's sake, open the door!

722
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:49,649
Oh, Jesus!

723
01:08:49,724 --> 01:08:51,589
Louisa!

724
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:53,650
Louisa!

01:08:53,728 --> 01:08:57,129

Mrs. Amworth?

733
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:46,145
Louisa.

734
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:56,220
Sam?

735
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,827
Sam?

736
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:04,224
Sam, are you in there?

737
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:07,200
Sam?

738
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:10,198
Sam!

739

[Sam whimpering]

740
01:10:21,216 --> 01:10:24,083
Sam. Are you all right?

741
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:27,714
Sam, are you okay?

742
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:30,920
What's wrong?

743
01:10:30,992 --> 01:10:32,357
Huh?

744
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:35,726
Hey. What's wrong?

745
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:37,264
What's wrong?

746
01:10:39,267 --> 01:10:41,201
I heard screaming.

747
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,900
Louisa.

748
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:51,238
Louisa, wake up. Wake up.

749
01:10:51,312 --> 01:10:53,303
- Daddy.
- Where's Mrs. Amworth?

750
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:56,145
- What?
- Mrs. Amworth, the babysitter.

751
01:10:56,217 --> 01:10:57,650
Where is she?

752
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,050
I don't know.

753
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:16,029
So I just went to bed.

754
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:20,097
Um, I woke up when my dad
came into my room.

755
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:22,404
And you didn't hear anyone screaming?

756
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:24,741
Mm-mm.

757
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:31,752
You, Sam, you said
you heard the sound of screams, right?

758
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:33,980
I heard her.

759
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,624
It was scary.

760
01:11:40,595 --> 01:11:42,426
Okay.

761
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:46,426
Ms. Parker.

762
01:11:50,438 --> 01:11:52,303
[Cassandra]
Maybe it's not too far down the road.

763
01:11:52,373 --> 01:11:53,533
[policeman]
Yeah. Yeah.

764
01:11:56,644 --> 01:12:00,205
So, uh, what happens now?

765
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:03,114
Well, I'm going to take a ride
over to Evelyn's.

766
01:12:03,184 --> 01:12:07,416
Hopefully, she's just left and gone home.

767
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:09,683
That wouldn't be like Evelyn at all.

768
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:14,259
You'll call me
as soon as you hear everything?

769
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:19,460
I will. In fact, Mr. James,
make sure you stay where I can reach you.

770
01:12:23,237 --> 01:12:24,670
Good evening.

771
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:32,176
Do you want me to stay?

772
01:12:36,918 --> 01:12:38,351
Better not.

773
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:41,582
I'll call you tomorrow.

774
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,579
Okay.

775
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,961
Your girlfriend's not staying over?

776
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:57,504
No.

777
01:12:57,572 --> 01:12:59,403
Don't you want her to?

778
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:04,868
Cassandra's going home,
and it's time for bed.

779
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:07,608
Why, because you say so?

780
01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:10,242
Yes, Louisa. Because I say so.

781
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:12,218
I'm the father. You're the daughter.

782
01:13:12,286 --> 01:13:14,880
Well, you don't know
how to be a fath...

783
01:13:14,956 --> 01:13:16,548
[retching]

784
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:38,709
Daddy.

785
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:42,280
I'm so cold.

786
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:46,220
It's okay.

787
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:48,721
Everything's going to be okay.

788
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:52,892
Are you going to leave me?

789
01:13:54,662 --> 01:13:56,061
No. No.

790
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:58,564
I'm not going to leave you.

791
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:00,157
But Mommy left.

792
01:14:00,234 --> 01:14:02,896
Why did Mommy leave?

793
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:14,776
You'll leave me, too, won't you?

794
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:16,282
Louisa.

795
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:22,448
I'll never leave you.

796
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:33,024
You have to try and rest, okay?

797
01:15:26,053 --> 01:15:27,247
Daddy.

798
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:32,257
Can I sleep with you tonight?

799
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:33,620
[panting]

800
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:36,245

I'm your new daughter.

All right, get your stuff.

804
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:29,305
I'll be right here
when you guys get out, okay?

805
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:30,503
[Sam]
Okay, Daddy. Bye.

806
01:17:36,684 --> 01:17:38,345
Have you heard from the police yet?

807
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:40,319
- Yeah.
- And?

808
01:17:40,388 --> 01:17:42,015
And there's still no sign of her.

809
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:47,321
She's going to turn up, Cassandra.
She has to.

810
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:48,453
Can you...

811
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:53,191
Can you keep an eye on Louisa for me?

812
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:54,825
Absolutely.

813
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:56,460
All right. Thank you.

814
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:41,671
Oh, no.

- Yeah.</i>

01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:14,206
Get that bulldozer up here
as soon as possible, all right?

01:19:39,406 --> 01:19:41,601
I've taken a look at the photos
of your property.

833
01:19:41,675 --> 01:19:43,302
<i>- I'm very intrigued.
- Well, actually, um...</i>

834
01:19:43,377 --> 01:19:46,175
Would it be possible for me to come
down there today and take a look?

835
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:47,680
<i>I do appreciate you taking the time,</i>

836
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:49,147
but there's been a change of plan.

837
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:52,242
I'm actually going to be
taking the mound down today.

838
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,150
Could you at least wait
until we get there?

839
01:19:54,221 --> 01:19:56,951
I can't talk about this anymore.
It's something I have to do today.

840
01:19:57,024 --> 01:19:58,150
<i>- Please...
- Thank you very much.</i>

841
01:19:58,225 --> 01:19:59,487
<i>Mr. James, please...</i>

842
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:17,971
This baby's going to blow.

843
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:39,989
Don't stop.

844
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:46,699
Hello?

845
01:20:48,209 --> 01:20:50,575
Professor Evan White.
We spoke on the phone.

846
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:51,975
Oh, that's right.

847
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:53,911
Look.

848
01:20:53,981 --> 01:20:55,915
Alexis Danella.

849
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:58,850
- I'm the professor's TA.
- Hello.

850
01:20:58,919 --> 01:21:02,650
Mr. James, an excavation
wouldn't take much time,

851
01:21:02,723 --> 01:21:05,351
and ritualized mound burial...

852
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:09,260
its study, it's important.

853
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,389
No, I'm doing this today.

854
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,591
What a waste.

855
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,236
Mr. James, mound burial is something

856
01:21:18,305 --> 01:21:21,706
that links many civilizations
all across the globe.

857
01:21:21,775 --> 01:21:23,902
I'm sorry.

858
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:26,674
This wants to be studied.

859
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:30,012
Hey, how come
they bury their dead like this?

860
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:31,915
Mostly, they didn't.

861
01:21:31,986 --> 01:21:34,784
Mound burial
was only for the most revered

862
01:21:34,855 --> 01:21:38,757
because, at least in some cases,
the mounds themselves were worshiped.

863
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:41,795
We found some evidence
in a limestone cave in Mississippi.

864
01:21:41,862 --> 01:21:46,026
There's drawings
that might depict a mythology

865
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,228
of the gods that existed
inside the mounds.

866
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:51,564
Inside?

867
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:53,971
They called them mound walkers.

868
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,440
Mounds were places of power,

869
01:21:55,509 --> 01:21:58,876
and the walkers were believed to be
a dying race of deities,

870
01:21:58,946 --> 01:22:01,039
weakened over thousands of years

871
01:22:01,115 --> 01:22:02,912
by the encroachment of humans
onto their land.

872
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:04,610
Rick, go on.

873
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:07,415
I've even found depictions of a ritual,

874
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:10,150
an exchanging of gifts
between the walkers

875
01:22:10,224 --> 01:22:13,159
and children of some of the native tribes.

876
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:16,493
Dolls?

877
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:22,635
Well...

878
01:22:22,703 --> 01:22:24,398
Straw dolls?

879
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:26,166
Yes, that's right. Um...

880
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:30,070
- how did you know that? I haven't...
- [engine starts]

881
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,313
Rick, wait.

882
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,745
[engine shuts down]

883
01:22:42,656 --> 01:22:44,681
What did they want?

884
01:22:44,758 --> 01:22:47,625
What any species wants... to survive.

885
01:22:47,695 --> 01:22:51,756
So, when faced with extinction,
the gods themselves began to pray.

886
01:22:51,832 --> 01:22:53,925
Pray for what?

887
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:57,493
A savior, a chosen one.

888
01:22:57,571 --> 01:23:00,199
And she would come
from the unlikeliest of places.

889
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:01,798
She would be human...

890
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,275
[shouting]

891
01:23:04,345 --> 01:23:05,676
...young girl...

892
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:10,215
and then the mating ritual would begin.

893
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:15,784
The myth was that the walkers
were an all-male race.

894
01:23:15,856 --> 01:23:19,053
They needed a mother, a queen,
to give birth to the next life's eggs.

895
01:23:19,126 --> 01:23:22,220
And then a new age would begin.

896
01:23:28,635 --> 01:23:30,125
Mr. James...

897
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:31,535
Do it now!

898
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,367
[engine starts]

899
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:43,745
[Alexis]
Mr. James, please.

900
01:23:47,688 --> 01:23:50,350
Aah!

901
01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:01,200
I've had officers combing for blood
in and around your house all day.

902
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:03,168
My... My house? Look, I didn't...

903
01:24:03,237 --> 01:24:05,501
Hey, I didn't do this.

904
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:07,403
Okay. All right.

905
01:24:07,474 --> 01:24:09,339
I'd like to believe that,

906
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:13,437
but we're going to do this right.

907
01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:16,711
But you're going to have to be
helpful and patient.

908
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:17,808
Understand?

909
01:24:17,885 --> 01:24:22,788
Can I at least call my kids
at their school?

910
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:24,585
I called Cassandra Parker already.

911
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:26,057
She, uh...

912
01:24:26,126 --> 01:24:29,220
She's going to take your kids home
and stay with them.

913
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:32,732
Look, I promised my kids
that I would pick them up.

914
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,960
I understand that.

915
01:24:34,034 --> 01:24:37,299
But I'm just going to need you
to stay here for a little while, all right?

916
01:24:37,371 --> 01:24:40,932
If your, uh, story checks out,
you're going to be with them soon enough.

917
01:24:41,008 --> 01:24:42,635
I give you my word, okay?

918
01:24:51,418 --> 01:24:53,511
My ants are dead.

919
01:24:53,587 --> 01:24:56,818
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Sam?

920
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:03,129
My ants are dead.

921
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,795
Those are eggs.

922
01:25:09,403 --> 01:25:11,268
Daddy was right.

923
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:13,772
There's a new queen.

924
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,537
Look how all the other ants
are surrounding her,

925
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:21,047
guarding her until it's done.

926
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:25,415
What's wrong, Sam?
Are you all right?

927
01:25:27,955 --> 01:25:31,789
I think something bad
is going to happen now.

928
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:35,795
Nothing bad is going to happen. Hmm?

929
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:43,764
There's something wrong with Louisa.
