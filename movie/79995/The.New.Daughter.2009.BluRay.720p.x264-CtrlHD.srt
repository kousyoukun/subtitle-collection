1
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,261
There it is.

2
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,289
- Real big.
- Mm.

3
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,403
Want to go in first?

4
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,236
- Really?
- I don't see why not.

5
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,313
Are you coming?

6
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,318
So?

7
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,297
So what?

8
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,230
So what do you... what do you think?

9
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,529
You already know what I think.

10
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,499
I did it, Dad!

11
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,404
That's great.

12
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,349
Lou!

13
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,369
They're here!

14
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,275
- Dad, we don't have any milk.
- I know. I'm sorry.

15
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,337
I didn't realize
that no one in town delivers.

16
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,348
And you forgot Marmalade's litter box.

17
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:22,343
I'll go into town tomorrow,
and I'll pick one up.

18
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,452
No, thank you.

19
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,293
I'm finished.

20
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,305
We're finished.

21
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,315
girls don't like jerky.

22
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,315
For dinner.

23
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,400
You going to unpack tomorrow, hon?

24
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,344
How are you going to do this?

25
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,471
Do what?

26
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,245
Be our father.
You don't have much practice.

27
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,479
I guess, um...

28
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,245
I guess we'll find out.

29
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,394
What are you writing?

30
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,256
A letter to Mom.

31
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,259
"Thanks for abandoning us.
You're a slut,

32
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,499
and your new boyfriend is a shit head. "

33
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,334
Well...

34
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,415
I agree with, uh, the second part.

35
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,315
Did you ever even love her?

36
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,252
Excuse me?

37
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,451
You didn't do anything. You let her go.

38
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,325
She made a decision, Louisa, okay?
I couldn't stop her.

39
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,330
But if you cared enough, you would have.

40
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,457
There was nothing I could do, honey.

41
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,263
And your mother...

42
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,462
your mother isn't a slut.

43
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,266
Fine.

44
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,365
I don't want you using that word anymore.

45
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,433
Fine.

46
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,274
Fine.

47
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,388
Can I come in?

48
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,335
You, uh...

49
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,327
you really did some work in here.

50
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,463
All by myself.

51
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,373
Yeah. All by yourself.

52
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,344
That's great. Thank you.

53
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,448
Louisa doesn't like it here.

54
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,312
Yeah.

55
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,343
What about you?

56
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,514
I like it if you like it.

57
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,427
I think it'll be good for us.

58
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,453
Is Mommy going to visit?

59
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,294
Maybe, if she saw
how much work I did unpacking,

60
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,431
she might.

61
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,467
Maybe you'll see her for Christmas.

62
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,244
- Okay? Good night.
- Good night.

63
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,380
Daddy?

64
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,479
Daddy!

65
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,382
Yeah?

66
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,484
You have to leave the door open a little.

67
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,223
Oh.

68
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,230
Sorry.

69
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:58,226
Daddy's, uh, forgetting a lot lately, huh?

70
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,304
- Good night.
- Good night.

71
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,502
You excited about
your first day of school tomorrow?

72
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,405
Yep.

73
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,382
You going to have some fun?

74
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,405
Yep.

75
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,351
Yeah. Good.

76
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,515
Well, good morning.

77
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,350
I couldn't sleep.

78
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,418
It was too quiet, and it was too dark.

79
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,227
This place sucks.

80
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,392
Please don't use that word.

81
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,268
- Doesn't mean what you think.
- I know what it means.

82
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,536
Okay, then really, don't use it.

83
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,246
What does sucks mean?

84
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,408
<i>John, how are the children?</i>

85
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,377
They're missing their mom,
but we're doing okay.

86
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,314
<i>I hope there will be
a good therapist there.</i>

87
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,338
Yeah.

88
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,317
<i>You never know
when your daughter needs one.</i>

89
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,354
Yeah, I'd say we're all
staring at some therapy.

90
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,356
<i>Well, anyway, how's the book coming?</i>

91
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,221
<i>When are we going to see some changes?</i>

92
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,281
<i>- The writing?
- Yeah.</i>

93
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,487
Well, the writing's, uh...
the writing's coming great.

94
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,497
<i>- Yeah, John?
- Yeah, it's coming great.</i>

95
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,297
I think I've already got
the first couple of chapters done.

96
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,471
How about I call you in a couple of weeks
when I have something to show you?

97
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,311
<i>- Sounds good, John.
- Good.</i>

98
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,441
<i>Bye.</i>

99
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,322
- Sam!
- I just found it.

100
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,358
Sam, put that down!

101
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,336
- Louisa...
- Daddy!

102
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,529
Daddy!

103
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,433
Sam, put that down.

104
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,466
Louisa, I just found it.

105
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,273
Sam!

106
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,249
Point that at the ground.

107
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,251
I need for you
to listen to me very carefully.

108
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,309
Louisa, come on.

109
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,344
I... I was playing the piano.

110
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,515
I want you to bend your knees, Sam.

111
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,419
I want you to bend your knees

112
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,260
and gently, gently lay that on the ground.

113
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,457
It was in there.

114
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,433
Sam, that's all right.

115
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,401
- That's okay.
- I'm going to tell...

116
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,269
Everything's all right.
You're not in trouble.

117
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,297
I want you to gently hand it to me.

118
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,412
I...

119
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,350
All right, all right. Hey. Hey.

120
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,484
Am I grounded?

121
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,351
Hmm?

122
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,293
Am I grounded?

123
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,422
No. You're not grounded.

124
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:25,404
And even if you were, Sam,
it wouldn't make any difference.

125
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,430
We're a hundred miles
from anyone you know.

126
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,532
Not now.

127
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,371
What are you going to do with it?

128
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,318
Want to let me worry about that?

129
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,512
Okay.

130
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,280
Come on, Sam. Let's go exploring.

131
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,290
Where?

132
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,420
Everywhere.

133
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,494
Come on.

134
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,471
Wait up, Lou.

135
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,512
- Oh!
- Be careful.

136
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,486
What the fuck?

137
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,360
- - Look at that.
- Whoa!

138
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,447
Hey, it was loaded, all right?
It was loaded.

139
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,478
<i>Okay, John.</i>

140
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,287
<i>Nobody got hurt, right?
I am sorry about that.</i>

141
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,487
I thought you might want to,
you know, contact the seller,

142
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,458
let him know that he left a piano
loaded with a shotgun

143
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,399
for my 7-year-old to find.

144
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,492
<i>- Wow. You got a piano.
- Yeah.</i>

145
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,298
<i>All right. Well, thank you, John.</i>

146
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,362
Okay, Stewart. Thank you very much.

147
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,465
<i>I am sorry about all this.</i>

148
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,439
Putz.

149
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,484
- Lou?
- Yeah.

150
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,487
Does Mommy not love us anymore?

151
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,349
No, Sam. Mom still loves us.

152
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,485
Did I do something?

153
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,353
No.

154
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,261
Did Daddy?

155
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,526
No.

156
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,464
What is that, Lou?

157
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,338
I don't know.

158
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,468
Louisa?

159
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,221
Dad.

160
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,449
We found something.

161
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,355
Are you coming?

162
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,390
Yep.

163
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,231
It... It's outside.

164
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,294
Yeah? We going to need jackets?

165
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,381
What is it, Daddy?

166
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,479
I don't know.

167
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,288
The realtor never said
anything about it.

168
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,351
Doesn't seem to be any sign
of a tractor dig or...

169
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,420
Feels old.

170
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,525
Sam, come up here.
I can almost see my window.

171
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,331
It's all right.

172
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,500
Come on.

173
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,345
No.

174
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,372
I... I don't want to.

175
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:07,443
Whatever.

176
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,250
Okay.

177
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,258
You can walk with me.
I don't want to go up there, either.

178
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,479
Marmalade. Marmalade.

179
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,484
Marmalade.

180
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,270
Marmalade?

181
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,375
Marmalade.

182
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,498
Here, Sam.

183
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,474
- What's that?
- Lunch.

184
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:21,410
You forgot to do it.
You were too busy losing Marmalade.

185
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,346
I'll find her.

186
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,316
- John James?
- Yes.

187
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,376
I'm Cassandra Parker.
We spoke on the phone.

188
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,286
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

189
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,258
You must be Louisa.

190
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,417
- Hi.
- Hi.

191
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:39,453
You are going to be in classroom 7
with Mr. Anderson.

192
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,261
- You're Sam, right?
- Uh-huh.

193
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,363
You're going to be in my class,
number 4.

194
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,397
Why don't you two follow
the rest of the kids inside?

195
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,409
Sure.

196
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,502
- I'll see you at 3?
- All right.

197
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,349
Do I have to go?

198
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,320
Can you give it a chance for me, Sam?

199
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,387
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

200
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,326
How did you know who I was?

201
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,396
Oh. It's a small town.

202
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,307
I know most of the parents and kids.

203
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:30,246
<i>But, uh, I read your book,
Lines of Fire, twice.</i>

204
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,340
I'm kind of a fan.

205
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,442
Is that weird?
Should I have not said anything?

206
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,354
No. No. It's always better
to meet a fan than a critic.

207
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,391
You're not perfect.

208
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,488
It was nice meeting you.

209
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,496
Nice meeting you.

210
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,242
You're in my seat.

211
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,440
Sorry.

212
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,473
I don't want it now.

213
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,384
Do I? You put your ass on it.

214
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,416
Oh, what? Is little baby going to cry?

215
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,409
Did you find everything all right today?

216
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,501
Mm-hmm.

217
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,377
So are you visiting? On vacation?

218
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,439
No, we just moved here
and bought a house.

219
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,349
Oh, well, welcome to Mercy.

220
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,411
Thank you. I can barely believe it myself.

221
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,513
You buy that house on Bacon Street?

222
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:51,355
No, we're... we're off, uh, we're off 38
up a dirt road called Red Creek.

223
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,352
Really?

224
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,296
Pam.

225
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,273
Ooh, uh, what is it?

226
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,240
It's nothing.

227
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,504
Really, man, it's nothing.

228
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,418
Okay, okay.

229
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,282
Really what?

230
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,515
it's nothing.
It's just stupid local stories.

231
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,348
Rumors, really.

232
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,358
- Rumors?
- Pam.

233
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,361
What about that woman?

234
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,295
Sarah Wayne? And her daughter?

235
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,332
Dear God, Pam,
enough with the gossip.

236
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,200
Anything else for you?

237
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,261
No, this is it.

238
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,333
And most of the ants inside these farms
are harvest ants,

239
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,503
but they have a nickname.
Does anyone know what that is?

240
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,440
- Yes.
- Beard ants.

241
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,483
Bearded ants. That's right.
And why is that?

242
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,348
Because they have tiny beards.

243
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,513
That's right.
They have tiny little beards.

244
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,415
They're kind of hard to see, though.

245
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:57,258
Now, there is, also, inside here
a queen ant.

246
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:02,427
A queen ant spends a lot of time
building all these tunnels,

247
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,335
and she finds a nice soft spot
where she can lay her eggs.

248
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,340
And after she does,
she pretty much stays there.

249
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,468
Marmalade!

250
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,277
Kitty!

251
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,311
Oh, God.

252
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,260
Uh...

253
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,493
I've been learning about
all different kinds of ants.

254
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,331
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

255
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,532
There's the army ants that never
stay in one place for too long.

256
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,298
- Yeah?
- And then there's these kinds of ants

257
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,468
that stay in their colony forever,

258
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,343
only to send out a scout
to look for food and stuff.

259
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,471
- Mm-hmm.
- There's only one girl ant

260
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,482
in the whole family. She's the queen ant.

261
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,517
- The grownup.
- And she's in charge.

262
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,385
What else did you do?

263
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,322
Well, after we all got ant farms,

264
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,486
me, Steven, and George played ping pong
during lunch for, like, hours.

265
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,361
Miss Parker's really nice.

266
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,331
What about you? What did you...

267
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,458
What did you do?

268
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,336
What's wrong with her?

269
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,238
I don't know.

270
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,514
Is little baby going to cry?

271
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,260
Aah! God.

272
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,380
Mm.

273
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,500
Son of a bitch.

274
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,700
Louisa?

275
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,830
Sam?

276
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,040
Daddy?

277
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,920
Have you, uh,

278
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,080
have you seen Louisa?

279
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,090
Did you find Marmalade yet?

280
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,900
No, I haven't.

281
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,020
I haven't found Marmalade yet, honey.

282
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,800
Were you playing outside?

283
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,070
Uh, bedtime soon, okay?

284
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,910
Okay.

285
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,850
Louisa?

286
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,990
Louisa, is everything all right?

287
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,970
Louisa!

288
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,990
Yeah?

289
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,040
Were you just, uh...

290
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,840
Were you just outside?

291
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,910
I'm in the bathtub.

292
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,040
Are you all right?

293
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,090
Yes.

294
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,820
Okay.

295
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,830
Okay, but just... next time,

296
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,950
just be back home before it gets dark.

297
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,100
Louisa, you, uh...

298
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,970
I'm coming.

299
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

300
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,820
Come here, baby.

301
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,010
Daddy?

302
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,820
We have to go to school.

303
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,020
Oh. Okay.

304
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,960
Louisa.

305
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,860
God damn it.

306
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,960
What happened?

307
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,900
I'm sorry.

308
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,840
Honey, we're going to be late.

309
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm ready.

310
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,010
Sam, where's your backpack?

311
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,850
My room.

312
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,920
Go get it.

313
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,990
Uh, when...

314
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,860
when did you, um...

315
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,030
Are you hungry?

316
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,900
No.

317
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,970
How did you, uh, sleep last night?

318
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,880
Fine.

319
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,880
You don't remember sleepwalking?

320
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,940
I had to put you back in your bed.

321
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Well, did you take Molly?

322
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,020
What?

323
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,920
My doll. Molly.

324
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,860
I woke up this morning,
and I couldn't find her.

325
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,020
No, I... I didn't take Molly, but I did...

326
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,090
I did find this.

327
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,870
- What's that?
- I don't know. You tell me.

328
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,030
Did you, uh... Did you make this?

329
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,040
I don't know what that is.

330
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,040
You were holding it last night.

331
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm ready.

332
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,990
Let's go, Sam.

333
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,080
Come on, Dad.

334
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,860
And his grades are much better this year.

335
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,020
I can really tell that he's
been picking up a lot.

336
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,930
I can see all the work that you've
been doing on his reading and...

337
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,030
Good morning.

338
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,850
Louisa!

339
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,020
Hey, you.

340
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,930
Are you hiding from me?

341
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,910
You're scared, aren't you?

342
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,010
What is wrong with you?

343
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,020
Are you deaf?

344
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,950
Say something.

345
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,990
- Hi.
- Hi.

346
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,950
Where's Louisa?

347
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,920
She's resting in the nurse's office.

348
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,020
We had another girl slip and fall.

349
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,050
Broke an arm.

350
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

351
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,880
How are you feeling?

352
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,880
- I don't feel good.
- Yeah?

353
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,910
After I called you,
she threw up a few more times.

354
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,120
My stomach hurts.

355
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,960
All right, let's go home.

356
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,860
Can you walk,
or do you want me to carry you?

357
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,020
- Carry me.
- Okay.

358
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,830
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

359
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,100
It's okay, honey.
You're going to feel better soon.

360
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,040
It's a tough age for girls.

361
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,950
Hormones, puberty... boys.

362
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,920
- It can be tough on fathers, too.
- Yes, it can.

363
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,820
She's, uh...

364
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,860
They both had it rough for a while.

365
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,860
My... My wife and I just got divorced,

366
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,060
so now with this move, it's just...

367
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,860
it's a lot for them to take in.

368
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,060
They might surprise you, though.

369
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,940
Kids have a way of coping with change,
sometimes better than adults.

370
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,970
Yeah.

371
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,040
And I've had experience
with adopted children,

372
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,010
- and they in no way...
- What?

373
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,950
Adopted?

374
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,010
Louisa's told me that she...

375
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,890
Oh.

376
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,020
Louisa said that she was...

377
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,930
- Yeah.
...adopted?

378
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,930
Yeah. And with her dark hair,
as opposed to yours and Sam's...

379
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,060
- She... She takes after her mom.
- Right.

380
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,960
Sorry.

381
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,060
Here.

382
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,970
My home phone number,

383
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,880
in case you ever need someone to talk to.

384
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,980
Thanks. I, uh, I better get going.

385
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,890
- Bye.
- Bye.

386
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,820
I told you I want you home
before it gets dark, honey.

387
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,920
Louisa.

388
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,060
We need to talk.

389
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,840
It's okay. I get it, all right? I get it.

390
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,830
You're not a child anymore.
You're changing.

391
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,000
And I know, all right?

392
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,070
I know I got a lot to learn
about being a parent,

393
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,970
but I promise...

394
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,040
I promise you I'm doing the best I can.

395
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,920
If this move doesn't work for you
and you hate it...

396
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,050
I don't hate it, Dad.

397
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,860
No?

398
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,990
No.

399
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,980
Honey, what's this?
Where did you get these?

400
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,070
Don't touch me.

401
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,080
Hey, I was just...

402
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,810
Why do you always have to ruin everything?

403
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,080
- Honey, I was just...
- Just leave me alone.

404
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,060
I just want to see if you're all right.

405
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,950
I went to San Francisco on a signing tour,

406
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,050
and a week later, when I got back
to, uh, Charleston,

407
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,830
she'd already hired a divorce
attorney and... filed papers.

408
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,100
- Wow.
- Yeah.

409
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,930
So sudden doesn't really cover it.

410
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,100
No.

411
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,040
So...

412
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,880
how did you end up with the kids?

413
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,950
That's the part
that I still don't understand yet.

414
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,960
I mean, my wife, uh...

415
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:50,090
my... my ex-wife Isabel,
she wanted to start a family.

416
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:54,900
She wanted us to move to Charleston
so we could be next to her parents,

417
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,900
and then, all of a sudden, she, uh...

418
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,960
she didn't want anything to do with us.

419
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,810
And now I'm, uh, I'm here,

420
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,110
and I know this is the most important
thing that I've ever done.

421
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,120
I know that, and it...

422
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,940
and it scares me...

423
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,110
more than anything.

424
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,100
John, you're not going to fail them.

425
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,040
You're doing a great job.

426
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,100
Oh, yeah. I'm doing great, you know.
I'm doing really great.

427
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,840
I don't even know who Louisa...

428
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,850
I don't even know who Louisa is anymore.

429
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,850
One minute she's my, uh, my little girl,

430
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,860
and then the next minute
she's telling me to go, you know,

431
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,050
screw myself.

432
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,090
You want to know what I think?

433
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,020
I do.

434
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:05,060
I think you're probably a lot stronger
than you give yourself credit for.

435
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,940
Thank you.

436
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,890
Louisa?

437
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,850
Louisa, is that you?

438
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,010
Honey?

439
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:55,900
Louisa.

440
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,830
- Dad.
- Go inside.

441
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,890
What happened? Dad?
Is everything okay?

442
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,960
- Just go inside.
- Daddy.

443
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,940
Were you just outside?

444
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,070
No.

445
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,980
I don't want you playing
out in the fields anymore, honey.

446
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,080
I don't want you
playing out on the mound.

447
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,920
So you take me away
from all of my friends,

448
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,080
- and now I can't even go outside?
- Louisa...

449
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,920
Look, I don't care.

450
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,900
What's wrong?

451
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,100
All my ants are dying.

452
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,810
I think it got too hot.

453
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,010
Or maybe it got too cold.

454
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,040
Did I kill them?

455
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,950
Well, ants usually don't live
that long anyway, honey,

456
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,080
and remember what you were saying
about there only being one girl ant?

457
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,820
You know, the queen?

458
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,950
Do you think she died?

459
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,860
They can't live without her.

460
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,960
Usually, before one queen dies,
another one is born, and...

461
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,060
See, there's, uh...

462
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,000
See? There's still some
moving around in there.

463
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,870
We'll just... We'll just have to
wait and see, honey.

464
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,880
What happens
if the queen dies before then?

465
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,970
Well, I don't...
Honey, I don't think that she will.

466
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,070
But what if she does?

467
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,980
Sam, I've got to go talk
to somebody, okay?

468
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,010
Can you watch some cartoons?

469
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,930
Could it have been a kid throwing rocks?

470
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,990
No.

471
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,090
Well...

472
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,970
I don't know, then.

473
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,100
We don't get anything out here
bigger than a pig.

474
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,880
Former owners
never mentioned anything.

475
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,940
All they ever asked about
was that old Indian burial mound.

476
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,120
Is that what that is?

477
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,880
Oh, I don't know.

478
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,860
Probably.

479
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,950
Was that the only thing
you wanted to talk about?

480
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,090
No, I wanted to talk to you
about the sale of the house

481
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,890
and the woman that went missing...
Sarah Wayne.

482
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,090
- What?
- Sarah Wayne.

483
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,930
She lived here with her daughter.

484
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,030
I read about it.

485
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,100
- Right.
- Right.

486
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,070
- About that...
- And when I bought the house,

487
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,050
you told me that the seller
was Roger Wayne.

488
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,910
Yeah. No. He was the seller, John.

489
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,010
- He was co-signer on Sarah's loan.
- Right.

490
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,020
When she disappeared,
he became the heir.

491
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,920
You never told me anything about this.

492
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,890
Well, there was no crime committed.

493
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,860
Okay? It was just assumed
that Sarah couldn't make payments,

494
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,860
so she bolted.

495
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,900
Yeah, but she left her 16-year-old
daughter, Stew.

496
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,920
You don't think that was
an important piece of information?

497
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,870
- Oh, come on.
- If not a little strange?

498
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,840
Look, John, the world is full
of deadbeat parents. Hmm?

499
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,850
You're going to love this.

500
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,910
What did you find?

501
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,880
You have to see.

502
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:40,000
What's up there, Lou?

503
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,930
After Sarah disappeared,

504
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,960
Roger took his granddaughter
Emily away.

505
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,060
Where?

506
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,970
I don't... A suburb of Charleston.

507
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,910
Suburb of Charleston. Okay.

508
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,880
Anything else?

509
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,020
And there was a house fire,

510
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,080
and the girl died.

511
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,890
There was a house fire,
and the girl died,

512
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,980
And you never told me
anything about this.

513
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,830
It doesn't have anything
to do with you, John.

514
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,920
You're going to give me the address
of the house that burned, Stewart,

515
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,870
and then I'm going to find
this Roger Wayne.

516
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,930
I have to know if my family is safe.

517
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,940
Louisa?

518
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,900
Louisa?

519
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,110
Lou?

520
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,080
Seven stitches, Lou.

521
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,920
Seven stitches.
What in the world were you thinking?

522
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,930
I didn't even scare him
He just let go of the ladder.

523
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,990
You're his older sister.
You're supposed to look out for him.

524
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,840
Sorry.

525
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,970
And he said you were
out at the mound again.

526
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,950
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

527
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,040
Yes? Well, what did I tell you?

528
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,910
- Well, you don't let me do anything.
- You...

529
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:11,010
You just sit here and wait.

530
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,960
You understand me?

531
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,860
We'll be going home soon.

532
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,870
- Hello.
- Hi.

533
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,000
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

534
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,870
Oh, no problem at all.

535
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,840
Cassandra Parker has given you
a glowing recommendation.

536
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,940
Oh, that was nice of her.

537
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,040
Please, uh, come in.

538
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,110
- This is Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

539
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,980
Hi.

540
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,990
My daughter Louisa's upstairs, okay?

541
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,890
I'm only going to be gone
four or five hours, all right?

542
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,020
Okay.

543
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,960
So if I'm delayed for any reason,
I'll call you.

544
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,830
- All right.
- Okay?

545
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:59,100
You'll be good? Yeah? You'll be okay?

546
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,000
- Big boy?
- Mm-hmm.

547
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,060
- Hmm? All right? Okay.
- Okay.

548
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:06,870
Um, one more thing.

549
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,900
Louisa is, uh, grounded.

550
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,970
She likes to play out in the fields
in the back,

551
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,040
but she's not allowed to right now.

552
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,910
I'll make sure she doesn't.

553
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,010
Okay. Be good.

554
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,820
<i>Professor Evan White's office.</i>

555
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,850
Yeah, this is John.

556
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,050
Hello, Mr. James.
We just got your email.

557
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,100
<i>Listen...</i>

558
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,960
<i>- It's very interesting.
- Yeah.</i>

559
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,930
The professor's looking at your photos.

560
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,020
<i>Listen, I really...</i>

561
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,970
- Evan, it's our writer.
- What?

562
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,800
The one with the mound.

563
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,900
- Evan.
- Okay, I'll be...

564
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:09,930
Evan!

565
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,870
Sam.

566
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:16,960
What?

567
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,000
Come play with me.

568
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,920
Where?

569
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,980
The mound.

570
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,890
We're not supposed to, Lou.

571
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,060
We're not supposed to, Lou.

572
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,030
- Get out!
- Okay.

573
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,010
- This is my house! Get out!
- All right.

574
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,030
- You're not wanted here.
- Wait.

575
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,100
- Get out!
- Roger Wayne?

576
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,040
Oh. I'm sorry. Are you...

577
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,880
Are you Roger Wayne?

578
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,920
What did you say?

579
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,020
I was going to get rid of that house.

580
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,970
Did you ever go out there?

581
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,030
Just once. I hadn't heard from Sarah
in over three weeks.

582
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:38,100
I was worried. I drove down.

583
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,010
She was gone.

584
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,810
And Emily...

585
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:49,980
I heard about your... granddaughter.

586
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,010
You live there now?

587
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,080
Yeah.

588
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,960
Have any children?

589
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:00,120
Yeah. A boy and a girl.

590
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,890
She changing?

591
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,060
What?

592
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,840
Your daughter, is she changing?

593
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,880
Emily changed.

594
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,090
What do you mean?

595
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,990
When I went out to that house,
I found her locked in the bedroom.

596
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,890
From the outside.
Sarah had locked her in there.

597
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,890
What are you talking about?

598
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:39,870
I brought Emily back to the city,
but she was sick.

599
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,030
Something inside of her had changed.

600
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,870
One night I woke up. It was pouring rain.

601
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:47,810
I went to check on her.

602
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:51,980
She wasn't in bed.

603
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,080
I found her in the backyard,
covered in mud

604
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:01,950
and digging in the ground
with her hands.

605
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:09,090
She wasn't really awake,
but she wasn't really asleep, either.

606
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,060
She didn't even seem to notice,

607
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,870
and I thank God for that.

608
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:21,840
When I picked her up
and brought her inside...

609
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,010
I started the fire.

610
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,860
What?

611
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,100
She wasn't my granddaughter anymore.

612
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,960
I had to do it. So will you.

613
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,940
Wait a minute. You started the fire?

614
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:49,870
My Sarah couldn't do
what needed to be done.

615
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:53,900
That's why she locked Emily
in the bedroom.

616
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,070
A father will do anything for his daughter,
even the worst thing.

617
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,850
Even the worst thing!

618
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,890
Taking her away from that place
did nothing!

619
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,860
You can't stop it!

620
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,030
Good night, Sam. Sweet dreams.

621
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,900
Good night, Mrs. Amworth.

622
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,040
Oh. Oh, Louisa, you scared me.

623
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,980
Have you been outside?

624
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,040
You'll definitely have to have a bath
before bed, so go wash up.

625
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,920
Look at you. You have...

626
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,120
Damn it.

627
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,830
Sam? Louisa?

628
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,920
Open the door, please.

629
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,900
Open the door!

630
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,930
Sam!

631
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,100
Open the door.

632
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,940
Open the door.

633
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,110
Louisa?

634
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,940
Louisa, open the door.
For God's sake, open the door!

635
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,980
Oh, Jesus!

636
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:51,990
Louisa!

637
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,020
Louisa!

638
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,860
Louisa! Louisa!

639
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:03,060
Please help me!

640
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,050
Mrs. Amworth?

641
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,840
Louisa.

642
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,880
Sam?

643
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,080
Sam?

644
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,880
Sam, are you in there?

645
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,860
Sam?

646
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,900
Sam!

647
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,850
Sam. Are you all right?

648
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,040
Sam, are you okay?

649
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:31,110
What's wrong?

650
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,020
Hey. What's wrong?

651
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,920
What's wrong?

652
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,900
I heard screaming.

653
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,090
Louisa.

654
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,870
Louisa, wake up. Wake up.

655
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,910
- Daddy.
- Where's Mrs. Amworth?

656
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,850
- What?
- Mrs. Amworth, the babysitter.

657
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,010
Where is she?

658
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,810
I don't know.

659
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,830
So I just went to bed.

660
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:20,830
Um, I woke up when my dad
came into my room.

661
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,960
And you didn't hear anyone screaming?

662
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:32,070
You, Sam, you said
you heard the sound of screams, right?

663
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,110
I heard her.

664
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:38,020
It was scary.

665
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,960
Okay.

666
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,960
Ms. Parker.

667
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,900
Maybe it's not too far down the road.

668
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:53,960
Yeah. Yeah.

669
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,870
So, uh, what happens now?

670
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,850
Well, I'm going to take a ride
over to Evelyn's.

671
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:07,940
Hopefully, she's just left and gone home.

672
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,010
That wouldn't be like Evelyn at all.

673
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,920
You'll call me
as soon as you hear everything?

674
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:19,950
I will. In fact, Mr. James,
make sure you stay where I can reach you.

675
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:24,990
Good evening.

676
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,880
Do you want me to stay?

677
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,910
Better not.

678
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,980
I'll call you tomorrow.

679
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,990
Okay.

680
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,130
Your girlfriend's not staying over?

681
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:57,990
No.

682
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,940
Don't you want her to?

683
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,070
Cassandra's going home,
and it's time for bed.

684
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,980
Why, because you say so?

685
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,910
Yes, Louisa. Because I say so.

686
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,920
I'm the father. You're the daughter.

687
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,080
Well, you don't know
how to be a fath...

688
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,030
Daddy.

689
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,880
I'm so cold.

690
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,880
It's okay.

691
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,010
Everything's going to be okay.

692
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,090
Are you going to leave me?

693
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,820
No. No.

694
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,990
I'm not going to leave you.

695
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,860
But Mommy left.

696
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,060
Why did Mommy leave?

697
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,030
You'll leave me, too, won't you?

698
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,880
Louisa.

699
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,940
I'll never leave you.

700
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:33,820
You have to try and rest, okay?

701
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:27,870
Daddy.

702
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,890
Can I sleep with you tonight?

703
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,920
Daddy!

704
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:55,060
I'm your new daughter.

705
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,100
All right, get your stuff.

706
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,900
I'll be right here
when you guys get out, okay?

707
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:30,960
Okay, Daddy. Bye.

708
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:38,910
Have you heard from the police yet?

709
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,950
- Yeah.
- And?

710
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:42,820
And there's still no sign of her.

711
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,920
She's going to turn up, Cassandra.
She has to.

712
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:48,950
Can you...

713
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,890
Can you keep an eye on Louisa for me?

714
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,090
Absolutely.

715
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,960
All right. Thank you.

716
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,000
Oh, no.

717
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,080
<i>- Rick?
- Yeah.</i>

718
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,820
I'm taking the mound down today.

719
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:57,920
<i>These things can be tricky.</i>

720
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:00,900
Maybe these things can be tricky.
I don't care.

721
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:03,020
<i>Many root systems go down pretty deep.</i>

722
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:06,040
<i>- Yeah, I...
- You have to get way below surface.</i>

723
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,930
<i>- I don't...
- I'll bring the diesel...</i>

724
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,870
<i>- Listen to me.
- Ammonium nitrate...</i>

725
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,840
<i>- Rick, look.
- Yeah.</i>

726
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:14,870
Get that bulldozer up here
as soon as possible, all right?

727
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,810
<i>- Sure, Mr. James.
- Thank you.</i>

728
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,090
<i>- Yeah?
- Mr. James,</i>

729
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,890
this is Evan White from
the University of Charleston.

730
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,920
<i>Hello, Professor.</i>

731
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,990
I've taken a look at the photos
of your property.

732
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,900
<i>- I'm very intrigued.
- Well, actually, um...</i>

733
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,880
Would it be possible for me to come
down there today and take a look?

734
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,000
<i>I do appreciate you taking the time,</i>

735
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,840
but there's been a change of plan.

736
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,900
I'm actually going to be
taking the mound down today.

737
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,880
Could you at least wait
until we get there?

738
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,110
I can't talk about this anymore.
It's something I have to do today.

739
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:58,880
<i>- Please...
- Thank you very much.</i>

740
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,980
<i>Mr. James, please...</i>

741
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:18,100
This baby's going to blow.

742
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,830
Don't stop.

743
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,030
Hello?

744
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,000
Professor Evan White.
We spoke on the phone.

745
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,100
Oh, that's right.

746
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,070
Look.

747
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,110
Alexis Danella.

748
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,110
- I'm the professor's TA.
- Hello.

749
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,020
Mr. James, an excavation
wouldn't take much time,

750
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:05,920
and ritualized mound burial...

751
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,890
its study, it's important.

752
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,920
No, I'm doing this today.

753
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:15,000
What a waste.

754
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,900
Mr. James, mound burial is something

755
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,030
that links many civilizations
all across the globe.

756
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:24,100
I'm sorry.

757
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:27,040
This wants to be studied.

758
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,840
Hey, how come
they bury their dead like this?

759
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,110
Mostly, they didn't.

760
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:35,080
Mound burial
was only for the most revered

761
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,020
because, at least in some cases,
the mounds themselves were worshiped.

762
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:42,060
We found some evidence
in a limestone cave in Mississippi.

763
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:46,820
There's drawings
that might depict a mythology

764
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,890
of the gods that existed
inside the mounds.

765
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:51,990
Inside?

766
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,090
They called them mound walkers.

767
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,930
Mounds were places of power,

768
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:59,100
and the walkers were believed to be
a dying race of deities,

769
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,800
weakened over thousands of years

770
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,110
by the encroachment of humans
onto their land.

771
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,010
Rick, go on.

772
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,950
I've even found depictions of a ritual,

773
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,850
an exchanging of gifts
between the walkers

774
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,890
and children of some of the native tribes.

775
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,960
Dolls?

776
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,970
Straw dolls?

777
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,870
Yes, that's right. Um...

778
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,840
...how did you know that? I haven't...

779
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,910
Rick, wait.

780
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:45,020
What did they want?

781
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:47,990
What any species wants... to survive.

782
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,050
So, when faced with extinction,
the gods themselves began to pray.

783
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:54,090
Pray for what?

784
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:57,960
A savior, a chosen one.

785
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,870
And she would come
from the unlikeliest of places.

786
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,030
She would be human...

787
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,000
...young girl...

788
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,910
and then the mating ritual would begin.

789
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,080
The myth was that the walkers
were an all-male race.

790
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:19,820
They needed a mother, a queen,
to give birth to the next life's eggs.

791
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:22,880
And then a new age would begin.

792
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,860
Mr. James...

793
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,960
Do it now!

794
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,040
Mr. James, please.

795
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:01,890
I've had officers combing for blood
in and around your house all day.

796
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,900
My... My house? Look, I didn't...

797
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,960
Hey, I didn't do this.

798
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,940
Okay. All right.

799
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,900
I'd like to believe that,

800
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:13,970
but we're going to do this right.

801
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:17,000
But you're going to have to be
helpful and patient.

802
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,050
Understand?

803
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:23,050
Can I at least call my kids
at their school?

804
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,990
I called Cassandra Parker already.

805
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,850
She, uh...

806
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,880
She's going to take your kids home
and stay with them.

807
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,020
Look, I promised my kids
that I would pick them up.

808
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,120
I understand that.

809
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:37,920
But I'm just going to need you
to stay here for a little while, all right?

810
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:41,100
If your, uh, story checks out,
you're going to be with them soon enough.

811
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,000
I give you my word, okay?

812
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,970
My ants are dead.

813
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,080
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Sam?

814
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,860
My ants are dead.

815
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,060
Those are eggs.

816
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:11,900
Daddy was right.

817
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:14,030
There's a new queen.

818
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,000
Look how all the other ants
are surrounding her,

819
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:21,810
guarding her until it's done.

820
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,940
What's wrong, Sam?
Are you all right?

821
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:32,050
I think something bad
is going to happen now.

822
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:36,050
Nothing bad is going to happen. Hmm?

823
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:44,060
There's something wrong with Louisa.

824
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,990
Hello?

825
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,060
<i>- Hello, Ed?
- No, this is John.</i>

826
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,080
<i>It's Skinner from the lab
for Officer Lowry.</i>

827
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:59,980
Hold on. I'm with Officer Lowry.
Let me put you on the speaker.

828
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:04,920
<i>Ed, hi. Look, we did a preliminary
autopsy on the body,</i>

829
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,080
<i>and it appears she was eaten alive.</i>

830
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,950
<i>- What could have done that?
- Ed, we're not sure.</i>

831
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:11,890
<i>The bite marks don't match
any known creatures,</i>

832
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:15,830
<i>and really, we've never seen
anything like this.</i>

833
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,030
Shit!

834
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,930
What the...

835
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,030
<i>Ed, are you there?</i>

836
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:25,010
Look, we're going to have to call you back.

837
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,070
<i>- Ed?
- Jesus Christ, I think I hit someone.</i>

838
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:31,840
No. Where are you going?
No, no, no. Stay in the car.

839
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,990
What happened to the light?

840
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,070
Come on.

841
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:01,100
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Hey!

842
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,010
Oh, my God!

843
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,080
Cassandra!

844
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,920
Sam!

845
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:52,860
Louisa!

846
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:13,840
God.

847
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,040
Oh. Cassandra.

848
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,930
Louisa. What happened?

849
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,980
Daddy!

850
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:42,030
Sam?

851
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,070
Sam?

852
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:51,880
Daddy!

853
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:56,950
It's okay, Sam. It's okay.
We're going home now.

854
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:58,120
She won't let us.

855
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,090
We're leaving, Louisa.

856
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,120
No.

857
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:06,060
We're not.

858
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:10,070
Louisa, listen to me.
Please, honey, just...

859
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:12,100
Louisa, just come...

860
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,910
Okay. Don't move. You don't move.

861
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:52,880
I'm going down there with them.

862
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,970
If you go somewhere, I can't follow you.

863
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,920
You will follow.

864
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,080
Shut up!

865
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,090
Shut up.

866
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:01,950
Please.

867
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,020
Louisa!

868
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:52,960
Daddy!

869
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,840
Don't move, Sam.

870
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:17,910
Daddy!

871
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:26,960
No, Daddy!

872
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,040
Daddy! Daddy!

873
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:38,100
Please, no!

874
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,940
Daddy...

875
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,040
Daddy.

876
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,950
Don't! Please, Daddy!

877
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,980
Don't!

878
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:55,830
Sam, you need to wait here, okay?

879
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,030
Wait here until the police come.

880
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,090
Here.

881
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,840
Where are you going?

882
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:10,940
Tell the police to call Mommy, okay?

883
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,110
Dad.

884
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:17,050
I love you, Sam, okay?

885
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:26,920
Okay. You want your monkey?

886
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,960
Your monkey will be safe with you, okay?

887
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:32,830
You be a big boy.

888
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:33,890
You be a big boy.

889
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,850
Be a big boy.

890
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,920
Come on.

891
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:05,870
Louisa?

892
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,070
Louisa.

893
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:17,080
Louisa.

894
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,010
Daddy?

895
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,050
Louisa.

896
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:27,890
I can come home now?

897
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,090
Yes, I will take you.

898
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:31,890
Take you out of here.

899
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:23,820
Okay. We're almost home,
but you're going to have to pull yourself.

900
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,110
You're going to have to push.

901
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:29,990
Hurry.

902
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:13,990
Louisa.

903
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,830
Daddy.

904
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,980
Don't leave me, Daddy.

905
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:19,950
Daddy?
