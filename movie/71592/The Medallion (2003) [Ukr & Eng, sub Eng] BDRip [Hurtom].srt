1
00:01:56,142 --> 00:01:59,578
"In the fourth month
of the Year of the Snake...

2
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,512
...a child shall be chosen...

3
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:07,813
...to meld the two halves of the sacred
medallion together as one.

4
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:10,080
And at his touch...

5
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,419
...the reborn shall be endowed...

6
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:18,155
...with extraordinary
supernatural powers."

7
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,057
You've done well.

8
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:25,130
As agreed.

9
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,968
Pitiful.

10
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:34,579
Many people would pay more...

11
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:38,315
...to be the keeper of such a book.

12
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,976
The only pitiful thing in this room...

13
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:42,553
...is your life.

14
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:44,981
Okay.

15
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,256
Actually...

16
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,963
...you have been
quite generous, yeah?

17
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:06,295
It's nobody you know, okay?

18
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:12,272
It's fish. See?

19
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,590
Happy now?

20
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:36,726
Cheers.

21
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,997
In English, please.

22
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:12,161
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.

23
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,311
Inspector.

24
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:24,111
Positive lD on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.

25
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,650
-And he's got company.
-Copy that.

26
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,218
Hold your position.

27
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,056
Pai Gow.

28
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,626
It's our guy.

29
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,162
All right, men.

30
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:54,636
-And Snakehead?
-Snakehead was not confirmed.

31
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:55,838
We should wait.

32
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,676
My intelligence says he's here...

33
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,410
...and Giscard is his number one.
We're going in.

34
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,082
I did not agree to this.

35
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:40,624
-We are supposed to be partners.
-This is an lnterpol operation.

36
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,556
The Hong Kong
Police Department's...

37
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,357
...involvement is strictly
a babysitting service.

38
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:49,966
You don't like it,
take it up with your boss.

39
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:06,446
It's true.

40
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:10,179
Tell him we found it and we're in.

41
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,781
Full force, men.

42
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:42,682
Razor-sharp and all that.

43
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,252
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

44
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,429
That's a temple. It's a holy place.

45
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,188
You cannot take guns in there.

46
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,801
Oh, right. Well, don't worry, Eddie,
because you see these guns?

47
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,230
They're holey guns.

48
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,964
Because they make
a rather big holey.

49
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:05,037
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.

50
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,341
All right.

51
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,550
Move out, men!

52
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,988
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.

53
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,856
Come on, keep up.

54
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:44,909
Inter--

55
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,509
Freeze!

56
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:49,913
Damn.

57
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,570
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.

58
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,401
Interpol! Freeze!

59
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,163
The medallion.

60
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,169
You cannot come in he--

61
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,597
You will give me what I want.

62
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,497
What's that?

63
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,159
Check it out.

64
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,993
-Go that way.
-Got it.

65
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,592
Peter?

66
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,359
Eddie.

67
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:06,910
Interpol! Fre--

68
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,417
What the he--?

69
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:20,491
You okay?

70
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,298
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.

71
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,668
It's the cops!

72
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,804
We've gotta go now!

73
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,342
I need more time.

74
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:38,008
-We haven't finished yet.
-It's too late.

75
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:40,345
-We'll try again later!
-Hong Kong Police!

76
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,156
Jai!

77
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,133
Hang on!

78
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:17,481
Eddie!

79
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,484
Snakehead! Upstairs!

80
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,017
Right!

81
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:44,775
Damn!

82
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:46,913
Four months' work!

83
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,720
What did he want in the temple?

84
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,091
He's a smuggler, Eddie. I don't know.

85
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:57,628
Perhaps he's found a buyer for
black-market Buddhas. The point is...

86
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,493
...you let him get away.

87
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,394
Watson.

88
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,369
I also saw his face.

89
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,977
Interpol's all over me,
and I can't stay here any longer.

90
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,741
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.

91
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:21,178
I trust you will make my continued--

92
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:23,514
Just bring me the boy.

93
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:39,331
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.

94
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,132
All right, notify the team--

95
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,434
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

96
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,042
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

97
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,374
Got it. The Sea Horizon.

98
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,361
-Where are you keeping the boy?
-ln a safe place.

99
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,225
Very good. Take me to him.

100
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:40,758
Up there. Okay.

101
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:31,377
-Where is he?
-Over here.

102
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,679
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!

103
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:37,482
Untie him. Don't hurt him.

104
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:38,918
Careful. Be careful.

105
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,692
Inspector, what's going on?

106
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,293
Snakehead's men.

107
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,455
Yes. Hello.

108
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,759
It's the boy.

109
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,666
Good morning, sir.

110
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,000
Show me the boy.

111
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:57,974
Oh. Of course.

112
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:03,173
That's him.

113
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,784
Treat him like a prince.

114
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,486
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.

115
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:14,351
Attention! This is the marine police.

116
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,128
You are ordered to stand down!

117
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,494
Prepare to be boarded.

118
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,257
Attention!

119
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,424
-Showtime!
-This is the marine police.

120
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:26,196
You are ordered to stand down!

121
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:27,862
Prepare to be boarded!

122
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,932
This is the marine police.

123
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,804
Look out!

124
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,385
Let's go!

125
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:43,819
Quickly! Go! Go!

126
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,901
Are you ready?

127
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,502
I'll cover you.

128
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:50,006
The boy!

129
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,222
Wave bye-bye!

130
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,867
We've interrogated the prisoner.

131
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:13,766
The boy's been taken to Snakehead
in lreland. Repeat, lreland.

132
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:20,301
Time for vacation.

133
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:21,637
Call me in lreland.

134
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:23,645
Bring me back a snake head.

135
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,186
-Can I help you, sir?
-Yes.

136
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:08,758
I'm lnspector Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

137
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:13,096
Yes. You have an appointment to the
commander.

138
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,528
Nicole.

139
00:21:19,705 --> 00:21:21,297
Inspector Eddie Yang.

140
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,771
I knew there couldn't be two of you.

141
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,068
Nice.

142
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:26,876
You clean up well.

143
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:28,335
Thank you.

144
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:40,380
Come on.

145
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,335
It's been a long time.

146
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:52,561
Three months.

147
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:54,831
I was assigned overseas and....

148
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,872
Oh, yeah.

149
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:58,702
You were gonna call me.

150
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,370
-I didn't know you'd been assigned--
-To lreland?

151
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:05,312
-Yes.
-Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.

152
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:07,145
I am now the official liaison...

153
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,346
...between the local lnterpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.

154
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,652
Maybe if you stayed in touch
like you promised....

155
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,194
Nicole.

156
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:18,590
I should have called.

157
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:20,156
I'm sorry.

158
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,500
That's worth something.

159
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,670
Not a lot, but something.

160
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,234
Commander?

161
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,839
Inspector Yang is here to see you.

162
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,133
Yes.

163
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:36,579
I'm Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.

164
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:37,737
Likewise, commander.

165
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,717
Commander, I was just--

166
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:48,522
What the bloody hell is he doing here?

167
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:50,286
Hello, Watson.

168
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,692
You're not telling me he'll be working
on this case?

169
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,730
Watson, we need all the help
we can get.

170
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:00,128
Yes.

171
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,529
You remember this boy?

172
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,772
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?

173
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,037
-Who's he?
-One moment.

174
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:11,581
Yes, I recognize him.

175
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:13,043
This is Lester Wong.

176
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:15,954
Snakehead's number two man.

177
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:19,557
That's privileged information,
eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.

178
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:23,354
-I need to find him, Watson.
-Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...

179
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,120
...but that's classified.

180
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:27,097
We've received a tip-off...

181
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:30,895
...that Snakehead does have a new
shipment arriving tomorrow in lreland.

182
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,299
-Maybe the boy will come with it.
-Where?

183
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:35,096
We don't know.

184
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:38,865
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.

185
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:42,603
-Watson!
-What?! I mean-- Sorry. What?

186
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:44,339
Any more nonsense like this...

187
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:48,577
...and you will be off the case, and the
inspector here will be in charge of it.

188
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:52,716
Satisfied?
You've only been here five minutes.

189
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,551
Watson!

190
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:02,358
You are in my filing cabinet.

191
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:11,974
Yes.

192
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:15,745
I was just getting these.

193
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,242
I think we're in trouble.

194
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:25,389
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?

195
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:27,457
Is it? Well, yes.

196
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:30,151
-Well, let me have it checked out.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:32,327
Watson, wait.

198
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:36,794
-Let's put Hong Kong behind us.
-I'm sorry, is somebody talking to me?

199
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:39,766
We were partners.
We were good together.

200
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:43,468
-You need me.
-Really? What do you want me to do?

201
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:45,667
Just welcome you back
with open arms?

202
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:48,642
We had a good thing going,
and you left!

203
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:53,506
Watson.

204
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:56,177
It just wasn't for me anymore.

205
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:58,846
I thought you understood.

206
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,457
Oh, I understand.

207
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:04,823
I understand that you didn't like me
always being on top.

208
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:10,198
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.

209
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:13,471
Let's just do it together. Okay?

210
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:18,442
No, but you have fun doing it
by yourself. All right?

211
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:30,514
You think because of the way....

212
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,828
Thank you.

213
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:51,264
Think we....

214
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,032
Well, we're not.

215
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:54,843
I'm a man!

216
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:59,516
Yes. No, there's nothing wrong
when two people love...

217
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:00,708
...one another.

218
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:02,547
It's a good thing. I....

219
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,384
That's your fault, that is.

220
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:09,855
Now, I'm gonna go home
and cook dinner for my wife!

221
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:24,567
So on a scale of one to 1 0...

222
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,441
...how did that go?

223
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:29,671
About a seven.

224
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,239
Below zero.

225
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:40,447
I think I know just what you need.

226
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,551
Dinner.

227
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,227
Dinner?

228
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,763
Yes, dinner.

229
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,891
We need Watson
for this investigation, Eddie.

230
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,594
He's stubborn, but if we can
catch him off guard...

231
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:56,297
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.

232
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:57,772
I'll just be myself.

233
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:04,744
One more thing.

234
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,811
Watson's family...

235
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:09,317
...they don't know
that he's an lnterpol agent.

236
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,581
-What do they think he is?
-A librarian.

237
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,553
-A librarian?
-Yes.

238
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,116
Hi.

239
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,225
-Nice apron.
-Thanks.

240
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:21,627
Look, you can't just
turn up and barge in.

241
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,463
Darling, I was wondering
if you saw my spatula.

242
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:28,105
-Charlotte, hello.
-Hello.

243
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:31,067
-Please. Please come in. Please.
-Thank you.

244
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:34,474
Arthur, you didn't tell me we were
having guests.

245
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,637
-Please, welcome.
-Didn't know myself.

246
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:39,110
-We're librarians.
-Librarian?

247
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,951
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

248
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,918
Are you staying for dinner?

249
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:49,526
-Yes.
-No. Absolutely not.

250
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:50,683
Thank you.

251
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,122
See what you've done to my chops?

252
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,996
What's that called?

253
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:01,561
Now?

254
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:04,805
"Lamb a la victim."

255
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:10,737
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.

256
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:12,380
You eat, you work.

257
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:51,522
What brings you to Dublin?

258
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:56,726
-Right. I was looking for--
-Looking for a rare book.

259
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:59,193
Yes, actually, we were wondering...

260
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,060
...if Arthur would help us find this
rare book.

261
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:06,966
Oh, well, unfortunately, I'm looking for
that book myself, so--

262
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:09,402
Maybe we could find it together.

263
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,439
But I'm head librarian, though, right?

264
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:18,304
Right.

265
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,357
You need help checking in?

266
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,630
I already checked in.

267
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,560
Okay.

268
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,773
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.

269
00:29:48,947 --> 00:29:50,608
He told me to give them to you.

270
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:54,545
Why can't he just pick me up?

271
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,314
It's Watson.

272
00:29:57,155 --> 00:30:01,182
"Privileged information, eyes-only,
need-to-know and all that." So....

273
00:30:06,564 --> 00:30:07,553
Okay.

274
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,055
Okay.

275
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,027
Nicole.

276
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,463
Yeah?

277
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,134
Tonight was fun.

278
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,799
Yeah.

279
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:42,455
Excuse me.

280
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:46,301
-ls this place far away or close by?
-Far away.

281
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,939
-Hop in the car and I'll take you.
-Thank you.

282
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,015
What are you doing?

283
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:05,812
Move.

284
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,275
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

285
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:35,951
-Oh, my!
-Sorry.

286
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:40,546
Did you see that?

287
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:49,859
What are you doing?

288
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:52,134
Open this door!

289
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:22,162
Hey, what's going on?

290
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,066
Now, mind yourself.

291
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,217
Come on.

292
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,463
Wait a minute.

293
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:01,233
What are you doing?
I haven't even done any--

294
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:09,402
Say it!

295
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:11,071
Talk! Where's the boy?

296
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:13,274
Let me out of here
or I'll kick your ass.

297
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:16,079
Speak English! You are hard
to understand!

298
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:19,052
-You ever hear of police brutality?
-Sounds like fun.

299
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:22,390
One more chance
until you kick the can.

300
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,255
You mean, "kick the bucket."

301
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:26,454
-What?
-You mean, "kick the bucket."

302
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:28,128
If you say so.

303
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,067
What kind of music you like?

304
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,235
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:37,800
Just let me out and we can talk
about this, all right?

306
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:41,036
He's coming on a boat. I don't know
what time. A freighter.

307
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,305
-He'll be coming into the docks.
-A boat!

308
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,472
Look, just let me out of here!

309
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:50,413
Do you know how long I've been
waiting here for you?

310
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:54,754
What's the matter? You sound like an
obscene phone call.

311
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:56,120
You're out of shape.

312
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:57,693
You should keep fit.

313
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:00,660
Right, but let's not waste any more
time, shall we?

314
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:06,662
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship,
if Giscard's telling the truth.

315
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:09,599
Let's hope so.
It's all we've got to go on.

316
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,117
Now, these are very
dangerous people, all right?

317
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:29,385
Do you have a gun?

318
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,859
No, are you going to give me one?

319
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:33,688
No, get your own bloody gun.

320
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:37,096
And remember,
I'm head librarian, all right?

321
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:38,428
-All right?
-Yes.

322
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:42,597
Right.

323
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:43,996
Here's the plan.

324
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,469
I'll circle around to the left.
You circle ar--

325
00:34:48,012 --> 00:34:49,240
You circle arou--

326
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,712
And I'll just bloody talk to myself.

327
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:56,743
Then you go straight through.
Go around.

328
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:41,596
Welcome, Chosen One.

329
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,048
Excuse me.

330
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:13,652
You're under arrest.

331
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,865
Come on! He went this way!

332
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,284
Have you seen him?

333
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,250
There.

334
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:52,766
Watson, come on!

335
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:04,672
Where's the boy?

336
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,612
-We couldn't find him.
-Find him!

337
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,011
Shoot him.

338
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,937
You okay?

339
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,339
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!

340
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:41,680
Interpol! Freeze!

341
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,998
-Hello?
-Hello, it's me.

342
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,196
Me, who?

343
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,668
Eddie! Where are you?

344
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,339
I'm trapped inside the container
with the boy.

345
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:08,843
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.

346
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:11,937
What color is it?

347
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:14,273
I don't know.

348
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:19,145
Watson.

349
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:23,017
-Eddie's in a container.
-Which one?

350
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,691
I have absolutely no idea.

351
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:37,863
There! There!

352
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,403
It's Eddie.

353
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,919
Eddie.

354
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:03,597
Eddie, it's Nicole. Just hang on.

355
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:11,097
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!

356
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:16,243
Nicole!

357
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:28,981
Oh, my God!

358
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,401
Don't be afraid.

359
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,902
I'm not afraid.

360
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:54,312
We'll be all right.

361
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:26,336
We got control of the container. We
believe that there's bodies inside.

362
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:38,182
I need an oxygen tank
and a stretcher. Now!

363
00:41:42,827 --> 00:41:44,692
Eddie, please don't leave me, Eddie.

364
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:47,558
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.

365
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,156
-You all right?
-Please.

366
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,091
Eddie, come back.

367
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:56,862
Nicole...

368
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,834
...he's gone.

369
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:13,212
Come on.

370
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,632
God bless, Eddie.

371
00:42:58,969 --> 00:42:59,958
God bless.

372
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:04,430
Nicole.

373
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:06,337
-We've got work to do.
-You sure?

374
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:07,966
I'm sure.

375
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:09,637
Let's go.

376
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:41,775
I'm sorry...

377
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:47,708
...I wasn't there when you needed me
most, my friend.

378
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,648
That was nice.

379
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,654
Thank you. I--

380
00:43:56,694 --> 00:43:58,093
-What's wrong?
-Who are you?

381
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,456
What's the matter?

382
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:01,960
Who are you? What--?

383
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:04,965
What are we doing here?
Where's my clothes?

384
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:08,494
Watson.

385
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:09,928
Watson.

386
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:20,447
-Watson!
-Get away from me!

387
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:24,443
It must be fake.

388
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:27,052
Well, it certainly looks like you.

389
00:44:29,226 --> 00:44:31,126
My nose isn't that big.

390
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:37,325
It's really me.

391
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:38,490
Are you sure?

392
00:44:38,669 --> 00:44:40,694
Don't you think I recognize
my own thing?

393
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:42,805
It's cold in here.
Let me take a look.

394
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:47,136
-What's happening to me?
-All right.

395
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,539
Let's just...

396
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:50,476
...stay calm.

397
00:44:51,415 --> 00:44:56,284
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational
explanation for this. Think back.

398
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:59,047
You were on the boat,
in the container.

399
00:44:59,223 --> 00:45:00,315
What happened?

400
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,515
Lights everywhere.

401
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:05,154
-The boy.
-The boy?

402
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,096
-Medallion.
-Yes.

403
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,526
I have it. It was in your pocket.

404
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:17,734
What's this?

405
00:45:19,276 --> 00:45:20,265
Wow.

406
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:42,523
Where did you go?

407
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,070
Excuse me, nurse.

408
00:45:54,244 --> 00:45:55,677
We're from lnterpol.

409
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:58,974
Would you mind if we have
a few moments with the boy?

410
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,717
You know, the man outside
says you're not eating.

411
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,120
You should eat to gain strength.

412
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:29,973
How are you feeling?

413
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:32,115
Feeling. Feel.

414
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:33,613
Feeling.

415
00:46:33,784 --> 00:46:35,877
Bit bumpy out there
on the ocean waves?

416
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:37,042
Bit rough?

417
00:46:39,556 --> 00:46:40,682
Out there?

418
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:49,526
Out there on the high seas?
Bumpity-bumpity?

419
00:46:50,901 --> 00:46:54,564
Excuse me. We have to take him
for a checkup now.

420
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:56,365
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:01,935
Wait.

422
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:13,450
I think this belongs to you.

423
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:24,256
Half for me?

424
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:39,646
Nice lad.

425
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:42,343
You okay?

426
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,414
That nurse....

427
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,548
Yeah.

428
00:47:49,026 --> 00:47:50,186
Her boots....

429
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:53,585
No.

430
00:47:54,264 --> 00:47:55,629
Her boots.

431
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,989
Oh, boots.

432
00:47:58,168 --> 00:48:00,136
Nurses don't wear boots.

433
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:09,636
Watch out!

434
00:48:16,787 --> 00:48:18,448
-Get out of my way!
-Sorry.

435
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,856
-Get the boy.
-Stop him.

436
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:31,996
What the heck?

437
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,179
Give me that!

438
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:02,862
There he goes!

439
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,189
Come here.

440
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:07,302
-I got him. I got him.
-There he is.

441
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:12,500
He's mine. I've got him.

442
00:50:03,894 --> 00:50:04,883
Let's go.

443
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:16,761
Jai!

444
00:50:18,175 --> 00:50:20,143
-Clear all exits.
-Right, sir.

445
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:33,455
Watson, are you there?

446
00:50:36,593 --> 00:50:37,787
I'm not here.

447
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:43,321
What happened?

448
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,695
Snakehead's men.
They were here for the boy.

449
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:49,964
-I'm gonna keep him with me.
-Good idea. Keep him safe. Yes. Yes.

450
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,969
Watson, you did all this alone?

451
00:50:54,144 --> 00:50:55,509
No, Eddie is--

452
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,309
I mean, I think I mentioned that Eddie
wasn't the only one with a black belt.

453
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:02,874
So you're all right?

454
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:04,979
Perfect.

455
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:08,824
-Great.
-Okay. I'll see you back at the--

456
00:51:08,992 --> 00:51:13,326
Yeah. I'm gonna do a couple of
press-ups and meet you back there.

457
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:15,260
Yes. Yes.

458
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:18,664
You just take care of the boy.

459
00:51:30,314 --> 00:51:32,748
-Eddie, listen--
-Watson, something wrong.

460
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:35,976
Snakehead's men got away again,
but at least the boy is safe.

461
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:38,246
I mean, something wrong with me.

462
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,879
Hit me.

463
00:51:41,758 --> 00:51:43,157
-What?
-Go on, hit me.

464
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,722
No, I can't do that.

465
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:46,523
It's okay, I don't mind.

466
00:51:46,697 --> 00:51:48,096
Well, I mind. I mean--

467
00:51:48,265 --> 00:51:50,199
A chap could break
a finger, you know.

468
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:51,629
Okay.

469
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,829
Use this.

470
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:57,772
-No, thanks. I went before I came out.
-No, hit me with this.

471
00:51:59,276 --> 00:52:01,267
-For real?
-Yes.

472
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:05,105
God.

473
00:52:11,555 --> 00:52:13,022
There you go. All right?

474
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,452
Harder.

475
00:52:14,624 --> 00:52:16,592
I can't do this. This is ridiculous.

476
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,092
-The queen hits harder than that.
-How--

477
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:20,987
How dare you.

478
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:23,132
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

479
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,066
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, my friend.
Did it hurt?

480
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:28,761
Of course it hurt.

481
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:30,599
But nothing.

482
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,031
I was shot before...

483
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,802
...but I was okay.

484
00:52:35,512 --> 00:52:36,501
Shoot me.

485
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,704
Go ahead.

486
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:41,116
No, I think the embalming fluid
has gone to your head.

487
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:43,309
-This is ridiculous.
-Give me the gun.

488
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:45,478
-Absolutely not.
-I'll show you.

489
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:49,591
You know how many forms I have to
fill out if I fire my gun? Absolutely not.

490
00:52:50,394 --> 00:52:52,521
-This is how accidents happen.
-Look.

491
00:53:01,271 --> 00:53:02,295
Amazing.

492
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:08,404
No blood.

493
00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:11,008
Amazing.

494
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,414
Incredible.

495
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:16,748
-See?
-I mean, still....

496
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:22,121
That's incredible. I mean, just....

497
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:33,395
-Stop that.
-I'm sorry.

498
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,595
That was below the belt. I'm sorry.

499
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:38,469
That's what I mean.

500
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:47,043
Can one of you explain
this latest failure?

501
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:50,152
Why you couldn't
retrieve one small boy?

502
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,309
Sir...

503
00:53:51,822 --> 00:53:53,653
...this might sound crazy...

504
00:53:53,824 --> 00:53:57,760
...but I emptied a whole clip into that
Chinese cop and he still wouldn't die.

505
00:53:57,928 --> 00:53:59,088
What Chinese cop?

506
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:01,560
That's Eddie Yang.

507
00:54:01,731 --> 00:54:05,064
He's supposed to have died yesterday,
drowned in that container.

508
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,236
Then it's true.

509
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,901
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

510
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,546
Thank you for being here.

511
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:20,342
We've come across something
very interesting.

512
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:22,644
Have you ever seen this before?

513
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:25,549
-Doesn't ring a bell. Doctor?
-I've seen that before.

514
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,850
-The fish is the sign of life.
-That's interesting.

515
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:31,186
-And the snake is the sign of--
-Whoa.

516
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:33,125
The medallion.

517
00:54:33,463 --> 00:54:34,623
You're gonna love this.

518
00:54:35,198 --> 00:54:37,962
Now, it should have a serpent
on one side.

519
00:54:40,203 --> 00:54:41,534
And a fish on the other.

520
00:54:43,607 --> 00:54:47,168
If what you have is real, that is
the Holy Grail of Eastern mythology.

521
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:49,778
And maybe the secret to eternal life.

522
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,606
Sweet!

523
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:58,383
-Where'd you get the medallion?
-I recognize the fish.

524
00:54:58,555 --> 00:55:00,682
- You got it from a kid, didn't you?
-Y es.

525
00:55:00,857 --> 00:55:02,825
The legend says
every thousand years...

526
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:05,928
...a child is chosen that can bind the
halves together...

527
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:09,998
...and restore life to the dead.
You get that kid and the medallion...

528
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:12,260
-...you're a god.
- That's nonsense.

529
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,164
-So where's the other half?
-Wait!

530
00:55:14,337 --> 00:55:17,465
The ancient texts say that if you want
superhuman strength...

531
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:20,201
...and immortality,
you need both halves.

532
00:55:20,377 --> 00:55:23,505
The only documented case
of a genuine resurrection....

533
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,240
You can't weigh it,
measure it, smoke it.

534
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:29,408
Look, ancient texts aren't fairy tales.

535
00:55:30,086 --> 00:55:32,179
Thank you, professor. Doctor. Doctor.

536
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:34,016
-Cheerio, for now.
-Good luck.

537
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,354
Why would a young boy
have something like this?

538
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:44,600
This Snakehead chap, is he
after the medallion or the boy?

539
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:47,059
By the way,
take good care of that kid.

540
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:51,462
The medallion can not only give life,
it can take it away.

541
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,949
Okay, I'll cover the front door,
call in for backup.

542
00:56:00,116 --> 00:56:03,142
You go to the rear to Nicole's
apartment as fast as you can.

543
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,651
Got it.

544
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,179
Sorry.

545
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:38,649
You know, for a little person,
you sure do eat a lot.

546
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,352
Still going?

547
00:56:42,092 --> 00:56:43,150
What did you have?

548
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:49,587
Okay.

549
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,395
Here we go.

550
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:53,930
Try that.

551
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:56,663
That good?

552
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:00,835
You don't like.... You're not....

553
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:08,510
One of my culinary skills...

554
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:11,119
...other than peeling fruit, of course...

555
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,717
...just so happens to be a toasted...

556
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:18,717
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich...

557
00:57:20,263 --> 00:57:24,063
...which, I might add, Eddie could eat
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

558
00:57:26,536 --> 00:57:28,800
Then again, he didn't really
have any choice.

559
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:32,707
-Why?
-Because I can't cook anything else.

560
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:45,752
I just can't believe
that he's really gone.

561
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:56,823
He's not gone.

562
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,239
Jai...

563
00:58:16,553 --> 00:58:19,249
...do you not understand that Eddie's
not coming back?

564
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:20,918
I pulled him back.

565
00:58:24,661 --> 00:58:25,719
Okay....

566
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,633
Jai, Eddie's....

567
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:32,790
He--

568
00:58:39,909 --> 00:58:41,843
Just hold on.

569
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:51,242
See?

570
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:56,719
Oh, my God.

571
00:58:57,427 --> 00:58:58,416
Eddie?

572
00:59:23,086 --> 00:59:24,075
Eddie.

573
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:28,182
Jai!

574
00:59:44,774 --> 00:59:46,207
No!

575
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:47,570
Eddie!

576
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,131
You see? I told you he wasn't dead.

577
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:44,555
The boy, sir.

578
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:45,723
Yes.

579
01:01:02,852 --> 01:01:03,841
Welcome...

580
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,885
...my old friend.

581
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:14,821
So...

582
01:01:15,031 --> 01:01:17,465
...a quick, painless death...

583
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,192
...followed by resurrection...

584
01:01:21,137 --> 01:01:22,661
...immortality...

585
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,231
...and powers beyond your dreams.

586
01:01:26,676 --> 01:01:27,904
Are you sure?

587
01:01:30,513 --> 01:01:33,710
His order is ruled
by reverence for life.

588
01:01:34,651 --> 01:01:37,415
My death before him
must be reversed.

589
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:40,418
And if it isn't...

590
01:01:40,657 --> 01:01:41,646
...kill him.

591
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,250
And then who would bring you back,
Chosen One?

592
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:23,992
Pitiful mortal.

593
01:02:26,603 --> 01:02:27,592
So...

594
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:31,434
...I have no further use
for you, Chosen One.

595
01:02:32,008 --> 01:02:33,168
You're not immortal.

596
01:02:33,776 --> 01:02:34,765
What?

597
01:02:34,944 --> 01:02:38,471
To become immortal, you need
both halves of the medallion.

598
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:40,013
Where's the other half?

599
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:43,140
Tell me!

600
01:02:47,357 --> 01:02:48,381
-Nicole.
-Eddie.

601
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:51,425
It's me. I'm fine, really.

602
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:52,918
I just....

603
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,722
I still don't understand, Eddie,
because I was there...

604
01:02:56,899 --> 01:03:00,130
-...and I saw you, and--
-Nicole, it's me.

605
01:03:00,637 --> 01:03:04,073
You see, it's just that I was at the
container and you were dead.

606
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,764
I mean, you were dead.

607
01:03:05,942 --> 01:03:09,309
Nicole, the boy uses the medallion
to give life.

608
01:03:09,479 --> 01:03:11,003
That's why Snakehead took him.

609
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:14,581
With the boy and the medallion,
he could....

610
01:03:15,218 --> 01:03:16,708
He could become like you?

611
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:19,714
Yes, but he needs
the whole medallion...

612
01:03:19,889 --> 01:03:22,050
...and he only has half.

613
01:03:24,394 --> 01:03:25,383
Look...

614
01:03:26,462 --> 01:03:28,020
...this is a touching reunion.

615
01:03:28,197 --> 01:03:30,631
We're all glad that Eddie's
amongst the living...

616
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,462
...but we still haven't found
Snakehead's helicopter.

617
01:03:33,636 --> 01:03:36,799
Get online. Find anything
that was in the air in the last hour.

618
01:03:36,973 --> 01:03:40,033
I don't care if it was a bird, a plane
or bloody Superman.

619
01:03:40,209 --> 01:03:42,109
No offense, old chap.

620
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,169
Eddie.

621
01:03:45,682 --> 01:03:48,708
If he needs the other half, he's
gonna come looking for you.

622
01:03:52,155 --> 01:03:53,884
If he is looking for me...

623
01:03:54,724 --> 01:03:56,817
...he'll be looking for my partner.

624
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:00,484
Me?

625
01:04:03,366 --> 01:04:04,560
My family.

626
01:04:05,168 --> 01:04:06,430
My family.

627
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:14,999
Cool.

628
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:19,003
See, that's not normal. I mean,
that's not natural. What--?

629
01:04:19,182 --> 01:04:20,877
Eddie, take my bike!

630
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:01,349
Thank God.

631
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:02,718
They're all right.

632
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:06,584
Charlotte?

633
01:05:06,763 --> 01:05:09,357
Charlotte? I have something
I have to tell you.

634
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,027
Yes, dear?

635
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:12,492
Eddie....

636
01:05:14,771 --> 01:05:16,170
Watson! They're here!

637
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:21,535
Go!

638
01:05:26,883 --> 01:05:27,872
Go!

639
01:05:31,087 --> 01:05:32,884
Charlotte, where are you going?

640
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:38,093
This is no time for cleaning.

641
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,859
Take your shield!

642
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:46,996
Watson!

643
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:55,671
-Are you all right, love?
-Yes, I'm fine, dear.

644
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:58,473
Catch!

645
01:05:58,681 --> 01:06:00,672
Here. I'll lead them away.

646
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:02,608
Your wife?

647
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:07,347
What the--?

648
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:13,390
There you are. Quick. Quick.
That's a good boy.

649
01:06:13,563 --> 01:06:17,659
Now, listen. Guns are very dangerous
things, all right? Right.

650
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:26,199
How dare you shoot...

651
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,476
...at my...

652
01:06:28,644 --> 01:06:30,339
...wife!

653
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,584
My Lord.

654
01:06:58,741 --> 01:06:59,935
Where'd he go?

655
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:05,637
We meet again...

656
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:06,873
...Eddie Yang.

657
01:07:15,925 --> 01:07:16,914
Where's the boy?

658
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:19,956
My guest is no concern of yours.

659
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:23,496
All that matters is that you have the
other half of the medallion.

660
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:31,231
Don't run, Eddie!

661
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:33,500
You can't hide from me!

662
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:44,415
The medallion is mine!

663
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:52,660
You think it's a game?

664
01:07:52,828 --> 01:07:54,318
Well, let's play!

665
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:16,815
We're the same, you and l.

666
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:29,189
What a pity. What a waste.

667
01:08:29,365 --> 01:08:31,356
You don't know
what powers you have.

668
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,955
Destiny calls.

669
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,623
He's sleeping. At least, I think that's
what he's doing.

670
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:09,101
He doesn't even look like he's
breathing.

671
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:10,427
The boy!

672
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:12,801
Oh, God, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

673
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:14,567
Eddie, you're all right.

674
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:16,671
The boy's in danger.

675
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:20,142
He's going to kill him. Right?!

676
01:09:20,316 --> 01:09:22,614
Snakehead has taken the boy
to Raven's Keep.

677
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:24,309
I told you everything I know.

678
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,509
I did.

679
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:27,416
We need to move fast.

680
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:31,287
Of course I can fly this thing.
I built it myself.

681
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,792
You take the bike.
I'll guide you from the air.

682
01:09:33,963 --> 01:09:35,260
I'm driving.

683
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:15,761
That's Raven's Keep.

684
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:18,263
It's five miles away.

685
01:11:04,453 --> 01:11:05,943
You should wash your hands.

686
01:11:08,224 --> 01:11:09,213
Come on.

687
01:11:29,211 --> 01:11:30,473
Nicole.

688
01:11:31,447 --> 01:11:32,436
Be careful.

689
01:11:32,982 --> 01:11:33,971
You too.

690
01:12:01,977 --> 01:12:05,037
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Where's the boy?

691
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:49,814
-Let's get out of here!
-Move!

692
01:12:49,992 --> 01:12:51,152
You cowards!

693
01:13:10,312 --> 01:13:11,939
Watson. Watson!

694
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:13,376
Are you crazy?

695
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:16,141
Be careful.

696
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:18,742
Interpol. Freeze.

697
01:13:27,997 --> 01:13:29,988
Jai, are you all right?

698
01:13:35,604 --> 01:13:36,696
There she is! Get her!

699
01:13:53,656 --> 01:13:55,453
Excuse me.

700
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,722
You looking for something?

701
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:40,834
Interpol! Freeze!

702
01:14:43,205 --> 01:14:44,638
Interpol! Freeze!

703
01:14:45,908 --> 01:14:47,136
Interpol! Free--

704
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,638
Jai, thank God.

705
01:14:52,815 --> 01:14:54,282
You're in danger.

706
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:56,179
It's over.

707
01:14:56,352 --> 01:14:57,876
You're safe now.

708
01:14:58,053 --> 01:14:59,247
I don't think so.

709
01:14:59,421 --> 01:15:01,013
No, it's all right.

710
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:08,919
Run!

711
01:15:13,102 --> 01:15:14,660
For your lives.

712
01:15:25,547 --> 01:15:28,607
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

713
01:15:31,553 --> 01:15:32,747
Fetch.

714
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:57,306
My brother...

715
01:15:58,247 --> 01:15:59,976
...don't be sentimental.

716
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:03,147
It's so unnecessary.

717
01:16:03,318 --> 01:16:04,512
It's so human.

718
01:16:04,953 --> 01:16:06,250
So normal.

719
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:08,652
You and I will live forever.

720
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:10,951
We are the lords of time.

721
01:16:11,126 --> 01:16:13,060
We can take whatever we choose.

722
01:16:15,898 --> 01:16:19,857
I mean, what difference can a single
human life like hers make to us?

723
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:22,366
We are immortal.

724
01:16:22,538 --> 01:16:23,903
Let me show you.

725
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:26,284
Eddie, use the medallion
to end the life that it gave.

726
01:20:08,797 --> 01:20:10,492
Can you?

727
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:14,762
It's your turn.

728
01:21:11,626 --> 01:21:12,615
What's that for?

729
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:15,557
That, Eddie Yang,
is for not catching me.

730
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:27,238
And that, Eddie Yang, is for not
catching me.

731
01:21:31,913 --> 01:21:33,574
Interpol! Freeze!

732
01:21:37,886 --> 01:21:39,820
Isn't that lovely?

733
01:21:41,089 --> 01:21:42,249
Of course...

734
01:21:42,424 --> 01:21:45,222
...when he came back, he was naked.

735
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,356
I mean, completely starkers.
Not a stitch.

736
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:50,555
I'm not complaining, mind you.

737
01:21:50,866 --> 01:21:52,595
Listen, I have this cough.

738
01:21:52,768 --> 01:21:56,067
I think it's quite serious.
Honestly, I could snuff at any point.

739
01:21:56,238 --> 01:21:59,036
I don't suppose you'd consider
a rub on your medallion?

740
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,731
I really am. Hello?

741
01:22:01,643 --> 01:22:03,110
It's very bad--

742
01:22:05,013 --> 01:22:06,412
Very bad. You--

743
01:22:06,581 --> 01:22:08,776
Please, the med-- One quick rub.

744
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:10,645
That's all. Oh, the medallion.

745
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,585
Quick. Give me the medallion.

746
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:18,148
Give it.

747
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:22,919
All right.

748
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:25,867
It was only a tickle anyway.

749
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:27,295
Come with me.

750
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,493
Wait!

751
01:22:30,772 --> 01:22:32,672
Nicole! Eddie!

752
01:22:32,841 --> 01:22:35,036
You can't leave me here.

753
01:22:43,018 --> 01:22:44,212
Goodbye!

754
01:22:47,122 --> 01:22:49,647
Okay, that wasn't scary at all.

755
01:22:49,825 --> 01:22:53,386
He walked through a vortex
to the next universe.

756
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,259
I'm going this way.

757
01:23:08,009 --> 01:23:10,876
-Quiet on the set. Are cameras ready?
-Cameras are ready.

758
01:23:11,046 --> 01:23:12,638
Jackie, Claire. And action.

759
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:13,803
I'm sorry.

760
01:23:15,517 --> 01:23:17,109
Can you overlap
that line for me?

761
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:20,311
Eddie Yang. I knew there
couldn't be two of you.

762
01:23:21,056 --> 01:23:24,321
-Will you say action, or am I just...?
-I did. Okay, here we go.

763
01:23:24,492 --> 01:23:25,789
And action.

764
01:23:27,562 --> 01:23:30,053
Three months and not so much
as a phone call?

765
01:23:30,532 --> 01:23:33,023
That made me so nervous.
I slapped you so hard.

766
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:35,533
-Come on! Oh, my God!
-ln the middle--!

767
01:23:35,704 --> 01:23:38,195
-I got slapped for nothing!
-I'm so sorry.

768
01:23:38,373 --> 01:23:41,672
-I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-I can't believe it.

769
01:23:41,843 --> 01:23:43,310
-Oh, no!
-Claire.

770
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:46,413
Jackie, I'm so sorry.
That rea-- That hurt me.

771
01:23:47,382 --> 01:23:50,283
-You should continue filming!
-Oh, I didn't know!

772
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:53,319
-Now I got another one!
-Oh, no!

773
01:23:53,855 --> 01:23:55,686
-That was really bad.
-Try it again.

774
01:23:56,391 --> 01:23:57,380
Let's go.

775
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,386
Let's move.

776
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:02,023
Take one.

777
01:24:02,197 --> 01:24:03,357
Eddie.

778
01:24:04,599 --> 01:24:06,692
All those things that I said--

779
01:24:08,937 --> 01:24:10,598
I was right there.

780
01:24:10,939 --> 01:24:11,928
--seven, take three.

781
01:24:12,607 --> 01:24:14,199
God bless, Eddie.

782
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,280
Action!

783
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,421
Cut!

784
01:24:31,493 --> 01:24:32,482
Cut.

785
01:24:33,061 --> 01:24:34,585
Take one.

786
01:24:35,263 --> 01:24:36,855
You-- Now, how--?

787
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:38,525
It's Giscard.

788
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,636
-Really? What about Snakehead?
-Snakehead is not here yet.

789
01:24:42,804 --> 01:24:45,068
Is he not here?
What about Ken?

790
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,939
-Yeah. Ken is--
-Pete? Pete?

791
01:24:47,108 --> 01:24:49,440
Pete is just right beside me.

792
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:50,839
That's it. We're fine.

793
01:24:53,081 --> 01:24:55,413
-Now, that's--
-Somebody let Jackie in.

794
01:24:57,819 --> 01:24:59,150
Here's the plan.

795
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:00,345
We have to--

796
01:25:01,323 --> 01:25:02,312
Whoops.

797
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,752
I got it wrong.

798
01:25:07,395 --> 01:25:08,862
It's this way.

799
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:12,630
Oh, sorry. It's the other way.

800
01:25:13,668 --> 01:25:15,158
Oh, damn.

801
01:25:15,503 --> 01:25:16,868
Oh, I missed.

802
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,529
Watson.

803
01:25:20,775 --> 01:25:22,743
-Cut. Print.
-Phone.

804
01:25:22,911 --> 01:25:24,208
-A-camera.
-Action.

805
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:26,813
Watson. So many things are going on.

806
01:25:30,018 --> 01:25:31,952
-Marker.
-Come on.

807
01:25:32,654 --> 01:25:34,485
-Marker.
-One more.

808
01:25:35,957 --> 01:25:36,946
Watson.

809
01:25:37,225 --> 01:25:39,716
Sorry. What? It's-- No, you-- No.

810
01:25:39,894 --> 01:25:40,918
-Again.
-Sorry.

811
01:25:41,096 --> 01:25:42,222
Marker!

812
01:25:47,035 --> 01:25:48,764
-Cut.
-Cut!

813
01:25:51,106 --> 01:25:52,471
I want ice cream.

814
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,110
Cut!

815
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:04,273
Cut!

816
01:26:04,586 --> 01:26:07,384
Slate X67, take one coming up.

817
01:26:07,555 --> 01:26:09,921
-A-marker.
-Like a woman.

818
01:26:10,992 --> 01:26:12,619
That's it. That's it. Okay.

819
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:15,524
It's just down there.

820
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:17,130
Down.

821
01:26:17,332 --> 01:26:18,924
Then the bottom.

822
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,624
Then the bottom.

823
01:26:22,203 --> 01:26:25,331
-Sorry, Jackie.
-What's this? "The bottom."

824
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,140
-Marker.
-Move!

825
01:26:33,014 --> 01:26:34,072
Wait, wait!

826
01:26:40,488 --> 01:26:41,648
Oh, shit.

827
01:26:42,123 --> 01:26:44,353
Nicole, the boy used the meda--

828
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:46,653
Very good. Cut. Cut.

829
01:26:49,364 --> 01:26:50,956
The dog barking.

830
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:52,258
Yeah, I heard it.

831
01:26:52,434 --> 01:26:54,026
Go. Go away.

832
01:26:54,869 --> 01:26:55,927
And action.

833
01:26:56,104 --> 01:26:57,731
Interpol! Freeze!

834
01:26:57,906 --> 01:26:58,895
Cut.

835
01:27:00,575 --> 01:27:01,735
A-camera.

836
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,944
In case of emergency...

837
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:06,470
...the exits are here...

838
01:27:06,748 --> 01:27:07,806
...here...

839
01:27:08,216 --> 01:27:10,081
...and here.

840
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:16,482
-I slapped you.
-Again.

841
01:27:16,658 --> 01:27:18,683
-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Oh, my God!

842
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:21,260
-lt was meant to be fake. Sorry.
-You do on purpose.

843
01:27:21,429 --> 01:27:22,726
Are you doing on purpose?

844
01:27:22,897 --> 01:27:24,797
Try it again, Claire.
A little harder.

845
01:27:24,966 --> 01:27:26,058
It drives me crazy.
