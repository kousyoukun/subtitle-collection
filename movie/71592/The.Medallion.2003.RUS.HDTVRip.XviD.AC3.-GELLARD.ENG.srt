1
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:58,318
"In the fourth month
of the Year of the Snake...

2
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,252
...a child shall be chosen...

3
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:06,553
...to meld the two halves of the sacred
medallion together as one.

4
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,820
And at his touch...

5
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:12,159
...the reborn shall be endowed...

6
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:16,895
...with extraordinary
supernatural powers."

7
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,797
You've done well.

8
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:23,870
As agreed.

9
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,708
Pitiful.

10
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,319
Many people would pay more...

11
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,055
...to be the keeper of such a book.

12
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,716
The only pitiful thing in this room...

13
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,293
...is your life.

14
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:43,721
Okay.

15
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,996
Actually...

16
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,703
...you have been
quite generous, yeah?

17
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,035
It's nobody you know, okay?

18
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,012
It's fish. See?

19
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,330
Happy now?

20
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,466
Cheers.

21
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:06,737
In English, please.

22
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:10,901
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.

23
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,051
Inspector.

24
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,851
Positive lD on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.

25
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,390
-And he's got company.
-Copy that.

26
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,958
Hold your position.

27
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:38,796
Pai Gow.

28
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,366
It's our guy.

29
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,902
All right, men.

30
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,376
-And Snakehead?
-Snakehead was not confirmed.

31
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,578
We should wait.

32
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,416
My intelligence says he's here...

33
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,150
...and Giscard is his number one.
We're going in.

34
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,822
I did not agree to this.

35
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,364
-We are supposed to be partners.
-This is an lnterpol operation.

36
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,296
The Hong Kong
Police Department's...

37
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,097
...involvement is strictly
a babysitting service.

38
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,706
You don't like it,
take it up with your boss.

39
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,186
It's true.

40
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:08,919
Tell him we found it and we're in.

41
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,521
Full force, men.

42
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,422
Razor-sharp and all that.

43
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,992
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

44
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,169
That's a temple. It's a holy place.

45
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,928
You cannot take guns in there.

46
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:54,541
Oh, right. Well, don't worry, Eddie,
because you see these guns?

47
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,970
They're holey guns.

48
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,704
Because they make
a rather big holey.

49
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,777
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.

50
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,081
All right.

51
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,290
Move out, men!

52
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,728
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.

53
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,596
Come on, keep up.

54
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,649
Inter--

55
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,249
Freeze!

56
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,653
Damn.

57
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,310
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.

58
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,141
Interpol! Freeze!

59
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,903
The medallion.

60
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,909
You cannot come in he--

61
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,337
You will give me what I want.

62
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,237
What's that?

63
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,899
Check it out.

64
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,733
-Go that way.
-Got it.

65
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,332
Peter?

66
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,099
Eddie.

67
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,650
Interpol! Fre--

68
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,157
What the he--?

69
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,231
You okay?

70
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:23,038
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.

71
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,408
It's the cops!

72
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,544
We've gotta go now!

73
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,082
I need more time.

74
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,748
-We haven't finished yet.
-It's too late.

75
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,085
-We'll try again later!
-Hong Kong Police!

76
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:52,896
Jai!

77
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,873
Hang on!

78
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,221
Eddie!

79
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,224
Snakehead! Upstairs!

80
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,757
Right!

81
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:43,515
Damn!

82
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,653
Four months' work!

83
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,460
What did he want in the temple?

84
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,831
He's a smuggler, Eddie. I don't know.

85
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,368
Perhaps he's found a buyer for
black-market Buddhas. The point is...

86
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,233
...you let him get away.

87
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,134
Watson.

88
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,109
I also saw his face.

89
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,717
Interpol's all over me,
and I can't stay here any longer.

90
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,481
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.

91
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,918
I trust you will make my continued--

92
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,254
Just bring me the boy.

93
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:38,071
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.

94
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,872
All right, notify the team--

95
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,174
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

96
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,782
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

97
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,114
Got it. The Sea Horizon.

98
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,101
-Where are you keeping the boy?
-ln a safe place.

99
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,965
Very good. Take me to him.

100
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,498
Up there. Okay.

101
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,117
-Where is he?
-Over here.

102
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,419
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!

103
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,222
Untie him. Don't hurt him.

104
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,658
Careful. Be careful.

105
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,432
Inspector, what's going on?

106
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,033
Snakehead's men.

107
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,195
Yes. Hello.

108
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,499
It's the boy.

109
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,406
Good morning, sir.

110
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,740
Show me the boy.

111
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,714
Oh. Of course.

112
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:01,913
That's him.

113
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,524
Treat him like a prince.

114
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,226
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.

115
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:13,091
Attention! This is the marine police.

116
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,868
You are ordered to stand down!

117
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,234
Prepare to be boarded.

118
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:19,997
Attention!

119
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,164
-Showtime!
-This is the marine police.

120
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,936
You are ordered to stand down!

121
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,602
Prepare to be boarded!

122
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,672
This is the marine police.

123
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,544
Look out!

124
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,125
Let's go!

125
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,559
Quickly! Go! Go!

126
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,641
Are you ready?

127
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,242
I'll cover you.

128
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,746
The boy!

129
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,962
Wave bye-bye!

130
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,607
We've interrogated the prisoner.

131
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,506
The boy's been taken to Snakehead
in lreland. Repeat, lreland.

132
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,041
Time for vacation.

133
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,377
Call me in lreland.

134
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,385
Bring me back a snake head.

135
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,926
-Can I help you, sir?
-Yes.

136
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,498
I'm lnspector Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

137
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,836
Yes. You have an appointment to the
commander.

138
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,268
Nicole.

139
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,037
Inspector Eddie Yang.

140
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,511
I knew there couldn't be two of you.

141
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,808
Nice.

142
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,616
You clean up well.

143
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,075
Thank you.

144
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,120
Come on.

145
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,075
It's been a long time.

146
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,301
Three months.

147
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,571
I was assigned overseas and....

148
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,612
Oh, yeah.

149
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,442
You were gonna call me.

150
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,110
-I didn't know you'd been assigned--
-To lreland?

151
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:04,052
-Yes.
-Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.

152
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,885
I am now the official liaison...

153
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,086
...between the local lnterpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.

154
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,392
Maybe if you stayed in touch
like you promised....

155
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,934
Nicole.

156
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:17,330
I should have called.

157
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:18,896
I'm sorry.

158
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,240
That's worth something.

159
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,410
Not a lot, but something.

160
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,974
Commander?

161
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,579
Inspector Yang is here to see you.

162
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:31,873
Yes.

163
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,319
I'm Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.

164
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,477
Likewise, commander.

165
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,457
Commander, I was just--

166
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:47,262
What the bloody hell is he doing here?

167
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:49,026
Hello, Watson.

168
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,432
You're not telling me he'll be working
on this case?

169
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,470
Watson, we need all the help
we can get.

170
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,868
Yes.

171
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,269
You remember this boy?

172
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,512
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?

173
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:06,777
-Who's he?
-One moment.

174
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,321
Yes, I recognize him.

175
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:11,783
This is Lester Wong.

176
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,694
Snakehead's number two man.

177
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,297
That's privileged information,
eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.

178
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:22,094
-I need to find him, Watson.
-Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...

179
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,860
...but that's classified.

180
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,837
We've received a tip-off...

181
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:29,635
...that Snakehead does have a new
shipment arriving tomorrow in lreland.

182
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,039
-Maybe the boy will come with it.
-Where?

183
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:33,836
We don't know.

184
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:37,605
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.

185
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,343
-Watson!
-What?! I mean-- Sorry. What?

186
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,079
Any more nonsense like this...

187
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,317
...and you will be off the case, and the
inspector here will be in charge of it.

188
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,456
Satisfied?
You've only been here five minutes.

189
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,291
Watson!

190
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,098
You are in my filing cabinet.

191
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:10,714
Yes.

192
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,485
I was just getting these.

193
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:18,982
I think we're in trouble.

194
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:24,129
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?

195
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,197
Is it? Well, yes.

196
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,891
-Well, let me have it checked out.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,067
Watson, wait.

198
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:35,534
-Let's put Hong Kong behind us.
-I'm sorry, is somebody talking to me?

199
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,506
We were partners.
We were good together.

200
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:42,208
-You need me.
-Really? What do you want me to do?

201
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:44,407
Just welcome you back
with open arms?

202
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:47,382
We had a good thing going,
and you left!

203
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,246
Watson.

204
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,917
It just wasn't for me anymore.

205
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,586
I thought you understood.

206
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,197
Oh, I understand.

207
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,563
I understand that you didn't like me
always being on top.

208
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,938
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.

209
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:12,211
Let's just do it together. Okay?

210
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:17,182
No, but you have fun doing it
by yourself. All right?

211
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,254
You think because of the way....

212
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,568
Thank you.

213
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,004
Think we....

214
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:51,772
Well, we're not.

215
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,583
I'm a man!

216
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:58,256
Yes. No, there's nothing wrong
when two people love...

217
00:25:58,424 --> 00:25:59,448
...one another.

218
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,287
It's a good thing. I....

219
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,124
That's your fault, that is.

220
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,595
Now, I'm gonna go home
and cook dinner for my wife!

221
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:23,307
So on a scale of one to 1 0...

222
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,181
...how did that go?

223
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,411
About a seven.

224
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,979
Below zero.

225
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:39,187
I think I know just what you need.

226
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:43,291
Dinner.

227
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,967
Dinner?

228
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:46,503
Yes, dinner.

229
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,631
We need Watson
for this investigation, Eddie.

230
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,334
He's stubborn, but if we can
catch him off guard...

231
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:55,037
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.

232
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,512
I'll just be myself.

233
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:03,484
One more thing.

234
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,551
Watson's family...

235
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:08,057
...they don't know
that he's an lnterpol agent.

236
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:10,321
-What do they think he is?
-A librarian.

237
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,293
-A librarian?
-Yes.

238
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:15,856
Hi.

239
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:17,965
-Nice apron.
-Thanks.

240
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,367
Look, you can't just
turn up and barge in.

241
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,203
Darling, I was wondering
if you saw my spatula.

242
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,845
-Charlotte, hello.
-Hello.

243
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,807
-Please. Please come in. Please.
-Thank you.

244
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,214
Arthur, you didn't tell me we were
having guests.

245
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,377
-Please, welcome.
-Didn't know myself.

246
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,850
-We're librarians.
-Librarian?

247
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,691
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

248
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,658
Are you staying for dinner?

249
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,266
-Yes.
-No. Absolutely not.

250
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,423
Thank you.

251
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,862
See what you've done to my chops?

252
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,736
What's that called?

253
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:00,301
Now?

254
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:03,545
"Lamb a la victim."

255
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,477
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.

256
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,120
You eat, you work.

257
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,262
What brings you to Dublin?

258
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,466
-Right. I was looking for--
-Looking for a rare book.

259
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,933
Yes, actually, we were wondering...

260
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,800
...if Arthur would help us find this
rare book.

261
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:05,706
Oh, well, unfortunately, I'm looking for
that book myself, so--

262
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:08,142
Maybe we could find it together.

263
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,179
But I'm head librarian, though, right?

264
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,044
Right.

265
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:35,097
You need help checking in?

266
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,370
I already checked in.

267
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,300
Okay.

268
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:47,513
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.

269
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,348
He told me to give them to you.

270
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,285
Why can't he just pick me up?

271
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,054
It's Watson.

272
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:59,922
"Privileged information, eyes-only,
need-to-know and all that." So....

273
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,293
Okay.

274
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:07,795
Okay.

275
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:12,767
Nicole.

276
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,203
Yeah?

277
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,874
Tonight was fun.

278
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,539
Yeah.

279
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,195
Excuse me.

280
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,041
-ls this place far away or close by?
-Far away.

281
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,679
-Hop in the car and I'll take you.
-Thank you.

282
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,755
What are you doing?

283
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:04,552
Move.

284
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,015
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

285
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:34,691
-Oh, my!
-Sorry.

286
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,286
Did you see that?

287
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:48,599
What are you doing?

288
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,874
Open this door!

289
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,902
Hey, what's going on?

290
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:23,806
Now, mind yourself.

291
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:46,957
Come on.

292
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:55,203
Wait a minute.

293
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,973
What are you doing?
I haven't even done any--

294
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,142
Say it!

295
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,811
Talk! Where's the boy?

296
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,014
Let me out of here
or I'll kick your ass.

297
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,819
Speak English! You are hard
to understand!

298
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,792
-You ever hear of police brutality?
-Sounds like fun.

299
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:21,130
One more chance
until you kick the can.

300
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,995
You mean, "kick the bucket."

301
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,194
-What?
-You mean, "kick the bucket."

302
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:26,868
If you say so.

303
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,807
What kind of music you like?

304
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:32,975
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,540
Just let me out and we can talk
about this, all right?

306
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:39,776
He's coming on a boat. I don't know
what time. A freighter.

307
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:42,045
-He'll be coming into the docks.
-A boat!

308
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,212
Look, just let me out of here!

309
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,153
Do you know how long I've been
waiting here for you?

310
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,494
What's the matter? You sound like an
obscene phone call.

311
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,860
You're out of shape.

312
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,433
You should keep fit.

313
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:59,400
Right, but let's not waste any more
time, shall we?

314
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,402
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship,
if Giscard's telling the truth.

315
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,339
Let's hope so.
It's all we've got to go on.

316
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,857
Now, these are very
dangerous people, all right?

317
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,125
Do you have a gun?

318
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,599
No, are you going to give me one?

319
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,428
No, get your own bloody gun.

320
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:35,836
And remember,
I'm head librarian, all right?

321
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,168
-All right?
-Yes.

322
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,337
Right.

323
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:42,736
Here's the plan.

324
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:46,209
I'll circle around to the left.
You circle ar--

325
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:47,980
You circle arou--

326
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:50,452
And I'll just bloody talk to myself.

327
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,483
Then you go straight through.
Go around.

328
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,336
Welcome, Chosen One.

329
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:07,788
Excuse me.

330
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,392
You're under arrest.

331
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,605
Come on! He went this way!

332
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,024
Have you seen him?

333
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:42,990
There.

334
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,506
Watson, come on!

335
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,412
Where's the boy?

336
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,352
-We couldn't find him.
-Find him!

337
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:10,751
Shoot him.

338
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:27,677
You okay?

339
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,079
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!

340
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,420
Interpol! Freeze!

341
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,738
-Hello?
-Hello, it's me.

342
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:00,936
Me, who?

343
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,408
Eddie! Where are you?

344
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,079
I'm trapped inside the container
with the boy.

345
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:07,583
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.

346
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:10,677
What color is it?

347
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,013
I don't know.

348
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:17,885
Watson.

349
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:21,757
-Eddie's in a container.
-Which one?

350
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,431
I have absolutely no idea.

351
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:36,603
There! There!

352
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:38,143
It's Eddie.

353
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,659
Eddie.

354
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,337
Eddie, it's Nicole. Just hang on.

355
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,837
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!

356
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:14,983
Nicole!

357
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:27,721
Oh, my God!

358
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,141
Don't be afraid.

359
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:40,642
I'm not afraid.

360
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:53,052
We'll be all right.

361
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:25,076
We got control of the container. We
believe that there's bodies inside.

362
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:36,922
I need an oxygen tank
and a stretcher. Now!

363
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,432
Eddie, please don't leave me, Eddie.

364
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,298
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.

365
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:48,896
-You all right?
-Please.

366
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,831
Eddie, come back.

367
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:55,602
Nicole...

368
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,574
...he's gone.

369
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:11,952
Come on.

370
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,372
God bless, Eddie.

371
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:58,698
God bless.

372
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,170
Nicole.

373
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,077
-We've got work to do.
-You sure?

374
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:06,706
I'm sure.

375
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,377
Let's go.

376
00:43:39,218 --> 00:43:40,515
I'm sorry...

377
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:46,448
...I wasn't there when you needed me
most, my friend.

378
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,388
That was nice.

379
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,394
Thank you. I--

380
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:56,833
-What's wrong?
-Who are you?

381
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,196
What's the matter?

382
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:00,700
Who are you? What--?

383
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:03,705
What are we doing here?
Where's my clothes?

384
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:07,234
Watson.

385
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,668
Watson.

386
00:44:17,356 --> 00:44:19,187
-Watson!
-Get away from me!

387
00:44:22,194 --> 00:44:23,183
It must be fake.

388
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:25,792
Well, it certainly looks like you.

389
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,866
My nose isn't that big.

390
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,065
It's really me.

391
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,230
Are you sure?

392
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,434
Don't you think I recognize
my own thing?

393
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,545
It's cold in here.
Let me take a look.

394
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,876
-What's happening to me?
-All right.

395
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,279
Let's just...

396
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,216
...stay calm.

397
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:55,024
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational
explanation for this. Think back.

398
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,787
You were on the boat,
in the container.

399
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,055
What happened?

400
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,255
Lights everywhere.

401
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,894
-The boy.
-The boy?

402
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:05,836
-Medallion.
-Yes.

403
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,266
I have it. It was in your pocket.

404
00:45:15,314 --> 00:45:16,474
What's this?

405
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:19,005
Wow.

406
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:41,263
Where did you go?

407
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,810
Excuse me, nurse.

408
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:54,417
We're from lnterpol.

409
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:57,714
Would you mind if we have
a few moments with the boy?

410
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,457
You know, the man outside
says you're not eating.

411
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,860
You should eat to gain strength.

412
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,713
How are you feeling?

413
00:46:29,388 --> 00:46:30,855
Feeling. Feel.

414
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,353
Feeling.

415
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:34,617
Bit bumpy out there
on the ocean waves?

416
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:35,782
Bit rough?

417
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,422
Out there?

418
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:48,266
Out there on the high seas?
Bumpity-bumpity?

419
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:53,304
Excuse me. We have to take him
for a checkup now.

420
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,105
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:00,675
Wait.

422
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,190
I think this belongs to you.

423
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:22,996
Half for me?

424
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,386
Nice lad.

425
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:41,083
You okay?

426
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,154
That nurse....

427
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,288
Yeah.

428
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:48,926
Her boots....

429
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,325
No.

430
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:54,369
Her boots.

431
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,729
Oh, boots.

432
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,876
Nurses don't wear boots.

433
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,376
Watch out!

434
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:17,188
-Get out of my way!
-Sorry.

435
00:48:17,696 --> 00:48:19,596
-Get the boy.
-Stop him.

436
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:30,736
What the heck?

437
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:52,919
Give me that!

438
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,602
There he goes!

439
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,929
Come here.

440
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,042
-I got him. I got him.
-There he is.

441
00:49:09,648 --> 00:49:11,240
He's mine. I've got him.

442
00:50:02,634 --> 00:50:03,623
Let's go.

443
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,501
Jai!

444
00:50:16,915 --> 00:50:18,883
-Clear all exits.
-Right, sir.

445
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:32,195
Watson, are you there?

446
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,527
I'm not here.

447
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:42,061
What happened?

448
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,435
Snakehead's men.
They were here for the boy.

449
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:48,704
-I'm gonna keep him with me.
-Good idea. Keep him safe. Yes. Yes.

450
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,709
Watson, you did all this alone?

451
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,249
No, Eddie is--

452
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:59,049
I mean, I think I mentioned that Eddie
wasn't the only one with a black belt.

453
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:01,614
So you're all right?

454
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:03,719
Perfect.

455
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,564
-Great.
-Okay. I'll see you back at the--

456
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:12,066
Yeah. I'm gonna do a couple of
press-ups and meet you back there.

457
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes. Yes.

458
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:17,404
You just take care of the boy.

459
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:31,488
-Eddie, listen--
-Watson, something wrong.

460
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,716
Snakehead's men got away again,
but at least the boy is safe.

461
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:36,986
I mean, something wrong with me.

462
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,619
Hit me.

463
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:41,897
-What?
-Go on, hit me.

464
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,462
No, I can't do that.

465
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,263
It's okay, I don't mind.

466
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:46,836
Well, I mind. I mean--

467
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:48,939
A chap could break
a finger, you know.

468
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:50,369
Okay.

469
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:52,569
Use this.

470
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:56,512
-No, thanks. I went before I came out.
-No, hit me with this.

471
00:51:58,016 --> 00:52:00,007
-For real?
-Yes.

472
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:03,845
God.

473
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:11,762
There you go. All right?

474
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,192
Harder.

475
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,332
I can't do this. This is ridiculous.

476
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,832
-The queen hits harder than that.
-How--

477
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:19,727
How dare you.

478
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:21,872
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

479
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,806
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, my friend.
Did it hurt?

480
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,501
Of course it hurt.

481
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:29,339
But nothing.

482
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:31,771
I was shot before...

483
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,542
...but I was okay.

484
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,241
Shoot me.

485
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,444
Go ahead.

486
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:39,856
No, I think the embalming fluid
has gone to your head.

487
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,049
-This is ridiculous.
-Give me the gun.

488
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:44,218
-Absolutely not.
-I'll show you.

489
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:48,331
You know how many forms I have to
fill out if I fire my gun? Absolutely not.

490
00:52:49,134 --> 00:52:51,261
-This is how accidents happen.
-Look.

491
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,035
Amazing.

492
00:53:05,984 --> 00:53:07,144
No blood.

493
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,748
Amazing.

494
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:13,154
Incredible.

495
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:15,488
-See?
-I mean, still....

496
00:53:17,095 --> 00:53:20,861
That's incredible. I mean, just....

497
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,135
-Stop that.
-I'm sorry.

498
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,335
That was below the belt. I'm sorry.

499
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,209
That's what I mean.

500
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:45,783
Can one of you explain
this latest failure?

501
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:48,892
Why you couldn't
retrieve one small boy?

502
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,049
Sir...

503
00:53:50,562 --> 00:53:52,393
...this might sound crazy...

504
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:56,500
...but I emptied a whole clip into that
Chinese cop and he still wouldn't die.

505
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:57,828
What Chinese cop?

506
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:00,300
That's Eddie Yang.

507
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,804
He's supposed to have died yesterday,
drowned in that container.

508
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,976
Then it's true.

509
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,641
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

510
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,286
Thank you for being here.

511
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,082
We've come across something
very interesting.

512
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,384
Have you ever seen this before?

513
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,289
-Doesn't ring a bell. Doctor?
-I've seen that before.

514
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:27,590
-The fish is the sign of life.
-That's interesting.

515
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,926
-And the snake is the sign of--
-Whoa.

516
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:31,865
The medallion.

517
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,363
You're gonna love this.

518
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,702
Now, it should have a serpent
on one side.

519
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,274
And a fish on the other.

520
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:45,908
If what you have is real, that is
the Holy Grail of Eastern mythology.

521
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:48,518
And maybe the secret to eternal life.

522
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,346
Sweet!

523
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:57,123
-Where'd you get the medallion?
-I recognize the fish.

524
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:59,422
- You got it from a kid, didn't you?
-Y es.

525
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:01,565
The legend says
every thousand years...

526
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:04,668
...a child is chosen that can bind the
halves together...

527
00:55:04,836 --> 00:55:08,738
...and restore life to the dead.
You get that kid and the medallion...

528
00:55:08,907 --> 00:55:11,000
-...you're a god.
- That's nonsense.

529
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,904
-So where's the other half?
-Wait!

530
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:16,205
The ancient texts say that if you want
superhuman strength...

531
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:18,941
...and immortality,
you need both halves.

532
00:55:19,117 --> 00:55:22,245
The only documented case
of a genuine resurrection....

533
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,980
You can't weigh it,
measure it, smoke it.

534
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:28,148
Look, ancient texts aren't fairy tales.

535
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,919
Thank you, professor. Doctor. Doctor.

536
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,756
-Cheerio, for now.
-Good luck.

537
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,094
Why would a young boy
have something like this?

538
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:43,340
This Snakehead chap, is he
after the medallion or the boy?

539
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,799
By the way,
take good care of that kid.

540
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:50,202
The medallion can not only give life,
it can take it away.

541
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,689
Okay, I'll cover the front door,
call in for backup.

542
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:01,882
You go to the rear to Nicole's
apartment as fast as you can.

543
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,391
Got it.

544
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,919
Sorry.

545
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:37,389
You know, for a little person,
you sure do eat a lot.

546
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,092
Still going?

547
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:41,890
What did you have?

548
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:48,327
Okay.

549
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,135
Here we go.

550
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:52,670
Try that.

551
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:55,403
That good?

552
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:59,575
You don't like.... You're not....

553
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:07,250
One of my culinary skills...

554
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,859
...other than peeling fruit, of course...

555
00:57:10,294 --> 00:57:13,457
...just so happens to be a toasted...

556
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:17,457
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich...

557
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:22,803
...which, I might add, Eddie could eat
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

558
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,540
Then again, he didn't really
have any choice.

559
00:57:28,046 --> 00:57:31,447
-Why?
-Because I can't cook anything else.

560
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,492
I just can't believe
that he's really gone.

561
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,563
He's not gone.

562
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,979
Jai...

563
00:58:15,293 --> 00:58:17,989
...do you not understand that Eddie's
not coming back?

564
00:58:18,396 --> 00:58:19,658
I pulled him back.

565
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:24,459
Okay....

566
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:30,373
Jai, Eddie's....

567
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:31,530
He--

568
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,583
Just hold on.

569
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:49,982
See?

570
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:55,459
Oh, my God.

571
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,156
Eddie?

572
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:22,815
Eddie.

573
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:26,922
Jai!

574
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:44,947
No!

575
00:59:45,116 --> 00:59:46,310
Eddie!

576
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:10,871
You see? I told you he wasn't dead.

577
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,295
The boy, sir.

578
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:44,463
Yes.

579
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:02,581
Welcome...

580
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,625
...my old friend.

581
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,561
So...

582
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:16,205
...a quick, painless death...

583
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:18,932
...followed by resurrection...

584
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,401
...immortality...

585
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,971
...and powers beyond your dreams.

586
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:26,644
Are you sure?

587
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:32,450
His order is ruled
by reverence for life.

588
01:01:33,391 --> 01:01:36,155
My death before him
must be reversed.

589
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,158
And if it isn't...

590
01:01:39,397 --> 01:01:40,386
...kill him.

591
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:43,990
And then who would bring you back,
Chosen One?

592
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,732
Pitiful mortal.

593
01:02:25,343 --> 01:02:26,332
So...

594
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:30,174
...I have no further use
for you, Chosen One.

595
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:31,908
You're not immortal.

596
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:33,505
What?

597
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:37,211
To become immortal, you need
both halves of the medallion.

598
01:02:37,388 --> 01:02:38,753
Where's the other half?

599
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:41,880
Tell me!

600
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:47,121
-Nicole.
-Eddie.

601
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:50,165
It's me. I'm fine, really.

602
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:51,658
I just....

603
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,462
I still don't understand, Eddie,
because I was there...

604
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,870
-...and I saw you, and--
-Nicole, it's me.

605
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:02,813
You see, it's just that I was at the
container and you were dead.

606
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,504
I mean, you were dead.

607
01:03:04,682 --> 01:03:08,049
Nicole, the boy uses the medallion
to give life.

608
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,743
That's why Snakehead took him.

609
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:13,321
With the boy and the medallion,
he could....

610
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,448
He could become like you?

611
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:18,454
Yes, but he needs
the whole medallion...

612
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,790
...and he only has half.

613
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:24,123
Look...

614
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:26,760
...this is a touching reunion.

615
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:29,371
We're all glad that Eddie's
amongst the living...

616
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:32,202
...but we still haven't found
Snakehead's helicopter.

617
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:35,539
Get online. Find anything
that was in the air in the last hour.

618
01:03:35,713 --> 01:03:38,773
I don't care if it was a bird, a plane
or bloody Superman.

619
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,849
No offense, old chap.

620
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,909
Eddie.

621
01:03:44,422 --> 01:03:47,448
If he needs the other half, he's
gonna come looking for you.

622
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,624
If he is looking for me...

623
01:03:53,464 --> 01:03:55,557
...he'll be looking for my partner.

624
01:03:58,235 --> 01:03:59,224
Me?

625
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:03,300
My family.

626
01:04:03,908 --> 01:04:05,170
My family.

627
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,739
Cool.

628
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,743
See, that's not normal. I mean,
that's not natural. What--?

629
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,617
Eddie, take my bike!

630
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,089
Thank God.

631
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,458
They're all right.

632
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:05,324
Charlotte?

633
01:05:05,503 --> 01:05:08,097
Charlotte? I have something
I have to tell you.

634
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:09,767
Yes, dear?

635
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:11,232
Eddie....

636
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:14,910
Watson! They're here!

637
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,275
Go!

638
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:26,612
Go!

639
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:31,624
Charlotte, where are you going?

640
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:36,833
This is no time for cleaning.

641
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:41,599
Take your shield!

642
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,736
Watson!

643
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:54,411
-Are you all right, love?
-Yes, I'm fine, dear.

644
01:05:55,586 --> 01:05:57,213
Catch!

645
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:59,412
Here. I'll lead them away.

646
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:01,348
Your wife?

647
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:06,087
What the--?

648
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,130
There you are. Quick. Quick.
That's a good boy.

649
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:16,399
Now, listen. Guns are very dangerous
things, all right? Right.

650
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:24,939
How dare you shoot...

651
01:06:25,783 --> 01:06:27,216
...at my...

652
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,079
...wife!

653
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,324
My Lord.

654
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:58,675
Where'd he go?

655
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,377
We meet again...

656
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:05,613
...Eddie Yang.

657
01:07:14,665 --> 01:07:15,654
Where's the boy?

658
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:18,696
My guest is no concern of yours.

659
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:22,236
All that matters is that you have the
other half of the medallion.

660
01:07:28,379 --> 01:07:29,971
Don't run, Eddie!

661
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:32,240
You can't hide from me!

662
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:43,155
The medallion is mine!

663
01:07:49,933 --> 01:07:51,400
You think it's a game?

664
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,058
Well, let's play!

665
01:08:14,224 --> 01:08:15,555
We're the same, you and l.

666
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:27,929
What a pity. What a waste.

667
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:30,096
You don't know
what powers you have.

668
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,695
Destiny calls.

669
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:04,363
He's sleeping. At least, I think that's
what he's doing.

670
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,841
He doesn't even look like he's
breathing.

671
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:09,167
The boy!

672
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,541
Oh, God, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

673
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:13,307
Eddie, you're all right.

674
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:15,411
The boy's in danger.

675
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:18,882
He's going to kill him. Right?!

676
01:09:19,056 --> 01:09:21,354
Snakehead has taken the boy
to Raven's Keep.

677
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:23,049
I told you everything I know.

678
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,249
I did.

679
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:26,156
We need to move fast.

680
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:30,027
Of course I can fly this thing.
I built it myself.

681
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,532
You take the bike.
I'll guide you from the air.

682
01:09:32,703 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm driving.

683
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:14,501
That's Raven's Keep.

684
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,003
It's five miles away.

685
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:04,683
You should wash your hands.

686
01:11:06,964 --> 01:11:07,953
Come on.

687
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,213
Nicole.

688
01:11:30,187 --> 01:11:31,176
Be careful.

689
01:11:31,722 --> 01:11:32,711
You too.

690
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:03,777
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Where's the boy?

691
01:12:47,064 --> 01:12:48,554
-Let's get out of here!
-Move!

692
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:49,892
You cowards!

693
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,679
Watson. Watson!

694
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:12,116
Are you crazy?

695
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:14,881
Be careful.

696
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:17,482
Interpol. Freeze.

697
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:28,728
Jai, are you all right?

698
01:13:34,344 --> 01:13:35,436
There she is! Get her!

699
01:13:52,396 --> 01:13:54,193
Excuse me.

700
01:13:57,801 --> 01:13:59,462
You looking for something?

701
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,574
Interpol! Freeze!

702
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:43,378
Interpol! Freeze!

703
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:45,876
Interpol! Free--

704
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,378
Jai, thank God.

705
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:53,022
You're in danger.

706
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:54,919
It's over.

707
01:14:55,092 --> 01:14:56,616
You're safe now.

708
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:57,987
I don't think so.

709
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,753
No, it's all right.

710
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,659
Run!

711
01:15:11,842 --> 01:15:13,400
For your lives.

712
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,347
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

713
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:31,487
Fetch.

714
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,046
My brother...

715
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:58,716
...don't be sentimental.

716
01:15:59,089 --> 01:16:01,887
It's so unnecessary.

717
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,252
It's so human.

718
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:04,990
So normal.

719
01:16:05,162 --> 01:16:07,392
You and I will live forever.

720
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:09,691
We are the lords of time.

721
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:11,800
We can take whatever we choose.

722
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:18,597
I mean, what difference can a single
human life like hers make to us?

723
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:21,106
We are immortal.

724
01:16:21,278 --> 01:16:22,643
Let me show you.

725
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:25,024
Eddie, use the medallion
to end the life that it gave.

726
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:09,232
Can you?

727
01:20:12,342 --> 01:20:13,502
It's your turn.

728
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,355
What's that for?

729
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:14,297
That, Eddie Yang,
is for not catching me.

730
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:25,978
And that, Eddie Yang, is for not
catching me.

731
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:32,314
Interpol! Freeze!

732
01:21:36,626 --> 01:21:38,560
Isn't that lovely?

733
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:40,989
Of course...

734
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:43,962
...when he came back, he was naked.

735
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,096
I mean, completely starkers.
Not a stitch.

736
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,295
I'm not complaining, mind you.

737
01:21:49,606 --> 01:21:51,335
Listen, I have this cough.

738
01:21:51,508 --> 01:21:54,807
I think it's quite serious.
Honestly, I could snuff at any point.

739
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:57,776
I don't suppose you'd consider
a rub on your medallion?

740
01:21:57,947 --> 01:21:59,471
I really am. Hello?

741
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:01,850
It's very bad--

742
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:05,152
Very bad. You--

743
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,516
Please, the med-- One quick rub.

744
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,385
That's all. Oh, the medallion.

745
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,325
Quick. Give me the medallion.

746
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:16,888
Give it.

747
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,659
All right.

748
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,607
It was only a tickle anyway.

749
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:26,035
Come with me.

750
01:22:28,244 --> 01:22:29,233
Wait!

751
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:31,412
Nicole! Eddie!

752
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:33,776
You can't leave me here.

753
01:22:41,758 --> 01:22:42,952
Goodbye!

754
01:22:45,862 --> 01:22:48,387
Okay, that wasn't scary at all.

755
01:22:48,565 --> 01:22:52,126
He walked through a vortex
to the next universe.

756
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,999
I'm going this way.

757
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:09,616
-Quiet on the set. Are cameras ready?
-Cameras are ready.

758
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:11,378
Jackie, Claire. And action.

759
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:12,543
I'm sorry.

760
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:15,849
Can you overlap
that line for me?

761
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:19,051
Eddie Yang. I knew there
couldn't be two of you.

762
01:23:19,796 --> 01:23:23,061
-Will you say action, or am I just...?
-I did. Okay, here we go.

763
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:24,529
And action.

764
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:28,793
Three months and not so much
as a phone call?

765
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:31,763
That made me so nervous.
I slapped you so hard.

766
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:34,273
-Come on! Oh, my God!
-ln the middle--!

767
01:23:34,444 --> 01:23:36,935
-I got slapped for nothing!
-I'm so sorry.

768
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:40,412
-I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-I can't believe it.

769
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,050
-Oh, no!
-Claire.

770
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:45,153
Jackie, I'm so sorry.
That rea-- That hurt me.

771
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:49,023
-You should continue filming!
-Oh, I didn't know!

772
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:52,059
-Now I got another one!
-Oh, no!

773
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:54,426
-That was really bad.
-Try it again.

774
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:56,120
Let's go.

775
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,126
Let's move.

776
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:00,763
Take one.

777
01:24:00,937 --> 01:24:02,097
Eddie.

778
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,432
All those things that I said--

779
01:24:07,677 --> 01:24:09,338
I was right there.

780
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:10,668
--seven, take three.

781
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,939
God bless, Eddie.

782
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,020
Action!

783
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,161
Cut!

784
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,222
Cut.

785
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:33,325
Take one.

786
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:35,595
You-- Now, how--?

787
01:24:36,139 --> 01:24:37,265
It's Giscard.

788
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:41,376
-Really? What about Snakehead?
-Snakehead is not here yet.

789
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:43,808
Is he not here?
What about Ken?

790
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,679
-Yeah. Ken is--
-Pete? Pete?

791
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:48,180
Pete is just right beside me.

792
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:49,579
That's it. We're fine.

793
01:24:51,821 --> 01:24:54,153
-Now, that's--
-Somebody let Jackie in.

794
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:57,890
Here's the plan.

795
01:24:58,061 --> 01:24:59,085
We have to--

796
01:25:00,063 --> 01:25:01,052
Whoops.

797
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:02,492
I got it wrong.

798
01:25:06,135 --> 01:25:07,602
It's this way.

799
01:25:09,072 --> 01:25:11,370
Oh, sorry. It's the other way.

800
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:13,898
Oh, damn.

801
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:15,608
Oh, I missed.

802
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,269
Watson.

803
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,483
-Cut. Print.
-Phone.

804
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:22,948
-A-camera.
-Action.

805
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,553
Watson. So many things are going on.

806
01:25:28,758 --> 01:25:30,692
-Marker.
-Come on.

807
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,225
-Marker.
-One more.

808
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:35,686
Watson.

809
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:38,456
Sorry. What? It's-- No, you-- No.

810
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:39,658
-Again.
-Sorry.

811
01:25:39,836 --> 01:25:40,962
Marker!

812
01:25:45,775 --> 01:25:47,504
-Cut.
-Cut!

813
01:25:49,846 --> 01:25:51,211
I want ice cream.

814
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:01,850
Cut!

815
01:26:02,024 --> 01:26:03,013
Cut!

816
01:26:03,326 --> 01:26:06,124
Slate X67, take one coming up.

817
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:08,661
-A-marker.
-Like a woman.

818
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:11,359
That's it. That's it. Okay.

819
01:26:11,534 --> 01:26:14,264
It's just down there.

820
01:26:14,437 --> 01:26:15,870
Down.

821
01:26:16,072 --> 01:26:17,664
Then the bottom.

822
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,364
Then the bottom.

823
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:24,071
-Sorry, Jackie.
-What's this? "The bottom."

824
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,880
-Marker.
-Move!

825
01:26:31,754 --> 01:26:32,812
Wait, wait!

826
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:40,388
Oh, shit.

827
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:43,093
Nicole, the boy used the meda--

828
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:45,393
Very good. Cut. Cut.

829
01:26:48,104 --> 01:26:49,696
The dog barking.

830
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,998
Yeah, I heard it.

831
01:26:51,174 --> 01:26:52,766
Go. Go away.

832
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:54,667
And action.

833
01:26:54,844 --> 01:26:56,471
Interpol! Freeze!

834
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:57,635
Cut.

835
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:00,475
A-camera.

836
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,684
In case of emergency...

837
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,210
...the exits are here...

838
01:27:05,488 --> 01:27:06,546
...here...

839
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:08,821
...and here.

840
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:15,222
-I slapped you.
-Again.

841
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:17,423
-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Oh, my God!

842
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,000
-lt was meant to be fake. Sorry.
-You do on purpose.

843
01:27:20,169 --> 01:27:21,466
Are you doing on purpose?

844
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:23,537
Try it again, Claire.
A little harder.

845
01:27:23,706 --> 01:27:24,798
It drives me crazy.
