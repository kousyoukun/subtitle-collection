1
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,718
"In the fourth month
of the Year of the Snake...

2
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,652
...a child shall be chosen...

3
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:07,953
...to meld the two halves of the sacred
medallion together as one.

4
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,220
And at his touch...

5
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,559
...the reborn shall be endowed...

6
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:18,295
...with extraordinary
supernatural powers."

7
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,197
You’ve done well.

8
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,270
As agreed.

9
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,108
Pitiful.

10
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,719
Many people would pay more...

11
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,455
...to be the keeper of such a book.

12
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,116
The only pitiful thing in this room...

13
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,693
...is your life.

14
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,121
Okay.

15
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,396
Actually...

16
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,103
...you have been
quite generous, yeah?

17
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,435
It’s nobody you know, okay?

18
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,412
It’s fish. See?

19
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,730
Happy now?

20
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,866
Cheers.

21
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,137
In English, please.

22
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,301
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.

23
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,451
Inspector.

24
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,251
Positive ID on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.

25
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,790
- And he’s got company.
- Copy that.

26
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,358
Hold your position.

27
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,196
Pai Gow.

28
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,766
It’s our guy.

29
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,302
All right, men.

30
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,776
- And Snakehead?
- Snakehead was not confirmed.

31
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,978
We should wait.

32
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,816
My intelligence says he’s here...

33
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,550
...and Giscard is his number one.
We’re going in.

34
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,222
I did not agree to this.

35
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,764
- We are supposed to be partners.
- This is an Interpol operation.

36
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,696
The Hong Kong
Police Department’s...

37
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,497
...involvement is strictly
a babysitting service.

38
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,106
You don’t like it,
take it up with your boss.

39
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,586
It’s true.

40
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,319
Tell him we found it and we’re in.

41
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,921
Full force, men.

42
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,822
Razor-sharp and all that.

43
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,392
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

44
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,569
That’s a temple. It’s a holy place.

45
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,328
You cannot take guns in there.

46
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,941
Oh, right. Well, don’t worry, Eddie,
because you see these guns?

47
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,370
They’re holey guns.

48
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,104
Because they make
a rather big holey.

49
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,177
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.

50
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,481
All right.

51
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,690
Move out, men!

52
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,128
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.

53
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,996
Come on, keep up.

54
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,049
Inter...

55
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,649
Freeze!

56
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,053
Damn.

57
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,710
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.

58
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,541
Interpol! Freeze!

59
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,303
The medallion.

60
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,309
You cannot come in he...

61
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,737
You will give me what I want.

62
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,637
What’s that?

63
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,299
Check it out.

64
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,133
- Go that way.
- Got it.

65
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,732
Peter?

66
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,499
Eddie.

67
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,050
Interpol! Fre...

68
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,557
What the he...?

69
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,631
You okay?

70
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,438
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.

71
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,808
It’s the cops!

72
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,944
We’ve gotta go now!

73
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,482
I need more time.

74
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,148
- We haven’t finished yet.
- It’s too late.

75
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,485
- We'll try again later!
- Hong Kong Police!

76
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,296
Jai!

77
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,273
Hang on!

78
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,621
Eddie!

79
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,624
Snakehead! Upstairs!

80
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,157
Right!

81
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,915
Damn!

82
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,053
Four months" work!

83
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,860
What did he want in the temple?

84
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,231
He’s a smuggler, Eddie. I don’t know.

85
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,768
Perhaps he’s found a buyer for
black-market Buddhas. The point is...

86
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,633
...you let him get away.

87
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,534
Watson.

88
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,509
I also saw his face.

89
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,117
Interpol’s all over me,
and I can’t stay here any longer.

90
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,881
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.

91
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,318
I trust you will make my continued...

92
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,654
Just bring me the boy.

93
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,471
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.

94
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,272
All right, notify the team...

95
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,574
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

96
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,182
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

97
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,514
Got it. The Sea Horizon.

98
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,501
- Where are you keeping the boy?
- In a safe place.

99
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,365
Very good. Take me to him.

100
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,898
Up there. Okay.

101
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,517
- Where is he?
- Over here.

102
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,819
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!

103
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,622
Untie him. Don’t hurt him.

104
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,058
Careful. Be careful.

105
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,832
Inspector, what’s going on?

106
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,433
Snakehead’s men.

107
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,595
Yes. Hello.

108
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,899
It’s the boy.

109
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,806
Good morning, sir.

110
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,140
Show me the boy.

111
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,114
Oh. Of course.

112
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,313
That’s him.

113
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,924
Treat him like a prince.

114
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,626
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.

115
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,491
Attention! This is the marine police.

116
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,268
You are ordered to stand down!

117
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,634
Prepare to be boarded.

118
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,397
Attention!

119
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,564
- Showtime!
- This is the marine police.

120
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,336
You are ordered to stand down!

121
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,002
Prepare to be boarded!

122
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,072
This is the marine police.

123
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,944
Look out!

124
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,525
Let’s go!

125
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,959
Quickly! Go! Go!

126
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,041
Are you ready?

127
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,642
L"II cover you.

128
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,146
The boy!

129
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,362
Wave bye-bye!

130
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,007
We've interrogated the prisoner.

131
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,906
The boy's been taken to Snakehead
in Ireland. Repeat, Ireland.

132
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,441
Time for vacation.

133
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,777
Call me in Ireland.

134
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,785
Bring me back a snake head.

135
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,326
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes.

136
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,898
I'm Inspector Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

137
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,236
Yes. You have an appointment to the
commander.

138
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,668
Nicole.

139
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,437
Inspector Eddie Yang.

140
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,911
I knew there couldn’t be two of you.

141
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,208
Nice.

142
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,016
You clean up well.

143
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,475
Thank you.

144
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,520
Come on.

145
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,475
It’s been a long time.

146
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,701
Three months.

147
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,971
I was assigned overseas and...

148
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,012
Oh, yeah.

149
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,842
You were gonna call me.

150
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,510
- I didn’t know you’d been assigned...
- To Ireland?

151
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,452
- Yes.
- Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.

152
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,285
I am now the official liaison...

153
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:11,486
...between the local Interpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.

154
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,792
Maybe if you stayed in touch
like you promised...

155
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,334
Nicole.

156
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,730
I should have called.

157
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,296
I’m sorry.

158
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,640
That’s worth something.

159
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,810
Not a lot, but something.

160
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,374
Commander?

161
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,979
Inspector Yang is here to see you.

162
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,273
Yes.

163
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,719
I’m Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.

164
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,877
Likewise, commander.

165
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,857
Commander, I was just...

166
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,662
What the bloody hell is he doing here?

167
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,426
Hello, Watson.

168
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,832
You’re not telling me he'll be working
on this case?

169
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,870
Watson, we need all the help
we can get.

170
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,268
Yes.

171
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,669
You remember this boy?

172
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,912
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?

173
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,177
- Who’s he?
- One moment.

174
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,721
Yes, I recognize him.

175
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,183
This is Lester Wong.

176
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,094
Snakehead’s number two man.

177
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,697
That’s privileged information,
eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.

178
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,494
- I need to find him, Watson.
- Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...

179
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,260
...but that’s classified.

180
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,237
We’ve received a tip-off...

181
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,035
...that Snakehead does have a new
shipment arriving tomorrow in Ireland.

182
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,439
- Maybe the boy will come with it.
- Where?

183
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,236
We don’t know.

184
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,005
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.

185
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,743
- Watson!
- What?! I mean... Sorry. What?

186
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,479
Any more nonsense like this...

187
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,717
...and you will be off the case, and the
inspector here will be in charge of it.

188
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,856
Satisfied?
You’ve only been here five minutes.

189
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,691
Watson!

190
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,498
You are in my filing cabinet.

191
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,114
Yes.

192
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,885
I was just getting these.

193
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,382
I think we’re in trouble.

194
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,529
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?

195
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,597
Is it? Well, yes.

196
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,291
- Well, let me have it checked out.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,467
Watson, wait.

198
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,934
- Let’s put Hong Kong behind us.
- I’m sorry, is somebody talking to me?

199
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,906
We were partners.
We were good together.

200
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,608
- You need me.
- Really? What do you want me to do?

201
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,807
Just welcome you back
with open arms?

202
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,782
We had a good thing going,
and you left!

203
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,646
Watson.

204
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,317
It just wasn’t for me anymore.

205
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,986
I thought you understood.

206
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,597
Oh, I understand.

207
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,963
I understand that you didn’t like me
always being on top.

208
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,338
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.

209
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,611
Let’s just do it together. Okay?

210
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:18,582
No, but you have fun doing it
by yourself. All right?

211
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,654
You think because of the way...

212
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:48,968
Thank you.

213
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,404
Think we...

214
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,172
Well, we’re not.

215
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,983
I’m a man!

216
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,656
Yes. No, there’s nothing wrong
when two people love...

217
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,848
...one another.

218
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,687
It’s a good thing. I...

219
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,524
That’s your fault, that is.

220
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,995
Now, I’m gonna go home
and cook dinner for my wife!

221
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,707
So on a scale of one to 10...

222
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,581
...how did that go?

223
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,811
About a seven.

224
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,379
Below zero.

225
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,587
I think I know just what you need.

226
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,691
Dinner.

227
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,367
Dinner?

228
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,903
Yes, dinner.

229
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,031
We need Watson
for this investigation, Eddie.

230
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,734
He’s stubborn, but if we can
catch him off guard...

231
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,437
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.

232
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,912
L"II just be myself.

233
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,884
One more thing.

234
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,951
Watson’s family...

235
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,457
...they don’t know
that he’s an Interpol agent.

236
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,721
- What do they think he is?
- A librarian.

237
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,693
- A librarian?
- Yes.

238
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,256
Hi.

239
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,365
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.

240
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,767
Look, you can’t just
turn up and barge in.

241
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,603
Darling, I was wondering
if you saw my spatula.

242
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,245
- Charlotte, hello.
- Hello.

243
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,207
- Please. Please come in. Please.
- Thank you.

244
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,614
Arthur, you didn’t tell me we were
having guests.

245
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,777
- Please, welcome.
- Didn’t know myself.

246
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,250
- We’re librarians.
- Librarian?

247
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,091
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

248
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,058
Are you staying for dinner?

249
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,666
- Yes.
- No. Absolutely not.

250
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,823
Thank you.

251
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,262
See what you’ve done to my chops?

252
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,136
What’s that called?

253
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,701
Now?

254
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,945
"Lamb à la victim."

255
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,877
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.

256
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,520
You eat, you work.

257
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,662
What brings you to Dublin?

258
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,866
- Right. I was looking for...
- Looking for a rare book.

259
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,333
Yes, actually, we were wondering...

260
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,200
...if Arthur would help us find this
rare book.

261
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:07,106
Oh, well, unfortunately, I’m looking for
that book myself, so...

262
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,542
Maybe we could find it together.

263
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,579
But I’m head librarian, though, right?

264
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,444
Right.

265
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,497
You need help checking in?

266
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,770
I already checked in.

267
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,700
Okay.

268
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,913
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.

269
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,748
He told me to give them to you.

270
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,685
Why can’t he just pick me up?

271
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,454
It’s Watson.

272
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,322
"Privileged information, eyes-only,
need-to-know and all that." So...

273
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,693
Okay.

274
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,195
Okay.

275
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,167
Nicole.

276
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,603
Yeah?

277
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,274
Tonight was fun.

278
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,939
Yeah.

279
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:42,595
Excuse me.

280
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,441
- Is this place far away or close by?
- Far away.

281
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,079
- Hop in the car and I'll take you.
- Thank you.

282
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,155
What are you doing?

283
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:05,952
Move.

284
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,415
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

285
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,091
- Oh, my!
- Sorry.

286
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,686
Did you see that?

287
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,999
What are you doing?

288
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,274
Open this door!

289
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,302
Hey, what’s going on?

290
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,206
Now, mind yourself.

291
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,357
Come on.

292
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,603
Wait a minute.

293
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,373
What are you doing?
I haven’t even done any...

294
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,542
Say it!

295
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,211
Talk! Where’s the boy?

296
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,414
Let me out of here
or I’ll kick your ass.

297
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:16,219
Speak English! You are hard
to understand!

298
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,192
- You ever hear of police brutality?
- Sounds like fun.

299
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,530
One more chance
until you kick the can.

300
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,395
You mean, "kick the bucket."

301
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,594
- What?
- You mean, "kick the bucket."

302
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,268
If you say so.

303
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,207
What kind of music you like?

304
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,375
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,940
Just let me out and we can talk
about this, all right?

306
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,176
He’s coming on a boat. I don’t know
what time. A freighter.

307
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,445
- He’ll be coming into the docks.
- A boat!

308
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,612
Look, just let me out of here!

309
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,553
Do you know how long I've been
waiting here for you?

310
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,894
What’s the matter? You sound like an
obscene phone call.

311
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,260
You’re out of shape.

312
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,833
You should keep fit.

313
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,800
Right, but let’s not waste any more
time, shall we?

314
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,802
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship,
if Giscard’s telling the truth.

315
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,739
Let’s hope so.
It’s all we’ve got to go on.

316
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,257
Now, these are very
dangerous people, all right?

317
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,525
Do you have a gun?

318
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,999
No, are you going to give me one?

319
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,828
No, get your own bloody gun.

320
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,236
And remember,
I’m head librarian, all right?

321
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,568
- All right?
- Yes.

322
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,737
Right.

323
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,136
Here’s the plan.

324
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,609
L"II circle around to the left.
You circle ar...

325
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,380
You circle arou...

326
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,852
And I’ll just bloody talk to myself.

327
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,883
Then you go straight through.
Go around.

328
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,736
Welcome, Chosen One.

329
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,188
Excuse me.

330
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,792
You’re under arrest.

331
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,005
Come on! He went this way!

332
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,424
Have you seen him?

333
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,390
There.

334
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,906
Watson, come on!

335
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:04,812
Where’s the boy?

336
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,752
- We couldn’t find him.
- Find him!

337
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,151
Shoot him.

338
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,077
You okay?

339
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,479
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!

340
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,820
Interpol! Freeze!

341
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,138
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

342
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,336
Me, who?

343
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,808
Eddie! Where are you?

344
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,479
I’m trapped inside the container
with the boy.

345
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,983
Stay right where you are.
I’m on my way.

346
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,077
What color is it?

347
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,413
I don’t know.

348
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,285
Watson.

349
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,157
- Eddie’s in a container.
- Which one?

350
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,831
I have absolutely no idea.

351
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,003
There! There!

352
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,543
It’s Eddie.

353
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,059
Eddie.

354
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,737
Eddie, it’s Nicole. Just hang on.

355
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,237
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!

356
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,383
Nicole!

357
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,121
Oh, my God!

358
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,541
Don’t be afraid.

359
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,042
I’m not afraid.

360
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,452
We’ll be all right.

361
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,476
We got control of the container. We
believe that there’s bodies inside.

362
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,322
I need an oxygen tank
and a stretcher. Now!

363
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,832
Eddie, please don’t leave me, Eddie.

364
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,698
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.

365
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,296
- You all right?
- Please.

366
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,231
Eddie, come back.

367
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,002
Nicole...

368
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,974
...he’s gone.

369
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,352
Come on.

370
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,772
God bless, Eddie.

371
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,098
God bless.

372
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,570
Nicole.

373
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,477
- We’ve got work to do.
- You sure?

374
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,106
I’m sure.

375
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,777
Let’s go.

376
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,915
I’m sorry...

377
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,848
...I wasn’t there when you needed me
most, my friend.

378
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,788
That was nice.

379
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,794
Thank you. L...

380
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,233
- What’s wrong?
- Who are you?

381
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,596
What’s the matter?

382
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,100
Who are you? What...?

383
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,105
What are we doing here?
Where’s my clothes?

384
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,634
Watson.

385
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,068
Watson.

386
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,587
- Watson!
- Get away from me!

387
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,583
It must be fake.

388
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,192
Well, it certainly looks like you.

389
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,266
My nose isn’t that big.

390
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,465
It’s really me.

391
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:38,630
Are you sure?

392
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,834
Don’t you think I recognize
my own thing?

393
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,945
It’s cold in here.
Let me take a look.

394
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,276
- What’s happening to me?
- All right.

395
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,679
Let’s just...

396
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,616
...stay calm.

397
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:56,424
I’m sure there’s a perfectly rational
explanation for this. Think back.

398
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,187
You were on the boat,
in the container.

399
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,455
What happened?

400
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,655
Lights everywhere.

401
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,294
- The boy.
- The boy?

402
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,236
- Medallion.
- Yes.

403
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,666
I have it. It was in your pocket.

404
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,874
What’s this?

405
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,405
Wow.

406
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,663
Where did you go?

407
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,210
Excuse me, nurse.

408
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,817
We’re from Interpol.

409
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:59,114
Would you mind if we have
a few moments with the boy?

410
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,857
You know, the man outside
says you’re not eating.

411
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,260
You should eat to gain strength.

412
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,113
How are you feeling?

413
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,255
Feeling. Feel.

414
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,753
Feeling.

415
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,017
Bit bumpy out there
on the ocean waves?

416
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,182
Bit rough?

417
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,822
Out there?

418
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:49,666
Out there on the high seas?
Bumpity-bumpity?

419
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,704
Excuse me. We have to take him
for a checkup now.

420
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,505
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,075
Wait.

422
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,590
I think this belongs to you.

423
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,396
Half for me?

424
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,786
Nice lad.

425
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,483
You okay?

426
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,554
That nurse...

427
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,688
Yeah.

428
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,326
Her boots...

429
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,725
No.

430
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,769
Her boots.

431
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,129
Oh, boots.

432
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,276
Nurses don’t wear boots.

433
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:09,776
Watch out!

434
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,588
- Get out of my way!
- Sorry.

435
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,996
- Get the boy.
- Stop him.

436
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,136
What the heck?

437
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,319
Give me that!

438
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,002
There he goes!

439
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,329
Come here.

440
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,442
- I got him. I got him.
- There he is.

441
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,640
He’s mine. I’ve got him.

442
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,023
Let’s go.

443
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:16,901
Jai!

444
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,283
- Clear all exits.
- Right, sir.

445
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,595
Watson, are you there?

446
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:37,927
I’m not here.

447
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,461
What happened?

448
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,835
Snakehead’s men.
They were here for the boy.

449
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:50,104
- I’m gonna keep him with me.
- Good idea. Keep him safe. Yes. Yes.

450
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,109
Watson, you did all this alone?

451
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,649
No, Eddie is...

452
00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:00,449
I mean, I think I mentioned that Eddie
wasn’t the only one with a black belt.

453
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,014
So you’re all right?

454
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,119
Perfect.

455
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,964
- Great.
- Okay. L"II see you back at the...

456
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:13,466
Yeah. I’m gonna do a couple of
press-ups and meet you back there.

457
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,400
Yes. Yes.

458
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,804
You just take care of the boy.

459
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,888
- Eddie, listen...
- Watson, something wrong.

460
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:36,116
Snakehead’s men got away again,
but at least the boy is safe.

461
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,386
I mean, something wrong with me.

462
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,019
Hit me.

463
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,297
- What?
- Go on, hit me.

464
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,862
No, I can’t do that.

465
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,663
It’s okay, I don’t mind.

466
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,236
Well, I mind. I mean...

467
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,339
A chap could break
a finger, you know.

468
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,769
Okay.

469
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:53,969
Use this.

470
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,912
- No, thanks. I went before I came out.
- No, hit me with this.

471
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,407
- For real?
- Yes.

472
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,245
God.

473
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,162
There you go. All right?

474
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,592
Harder.

475
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,732
I can’t do this. This is ridiculous.

476
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,232
- The queen hits harder than that.
- How...

477
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,127
How dare you.

478
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,272
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

479
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,206
Oh, God. I’m so sorry, my friend.
Did it hurt?

480
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,901
Of course it hurt.

481
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,739
But nothing.

482
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,171
I was shot before...

483
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,942
...but I was okay.

484
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,641
Shoot me.

485
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,844
Go ahead.

486
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,256
No, I think the embalming fluid
has gone to your head.

487
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,449
- This is ridiculous.
- Give me the gun.

488
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,618
- Absolutely not.
- L"II show you.

489
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,731
You know how many forms I have to
fill out if I fire my gun? Absolutely not.

490
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,661
- This is how accidents happen.
- Look.

491
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,435
Amazing.

492
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,544
No blood.

493
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,148
Amazing.

494
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,554
Incredible.

495
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,888
- See?
- I mean, still...

496
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:22,261
That’s incredible. I mean, just...

497
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,535
- Stop that.
- I’m sorry.

498
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,735
That was below the belt. I’m sorry.

499
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,609
That’s what I mean.

500
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,183
Can one of you explain
this latest failure?

501
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,292
Why you couldn’t
retrieve one small boy?

502
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,449
Sir...

503
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,793
...this might sound crazy...

504
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,900
...but I emptied a whole clip into that
Chinese cop and he still wouldn’t die.

505
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,228
What Chinese cop?

506
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,700
That’s Eddie Yang.

507
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:05,204
He’s supposed to have died yesterday,
drowned in that container.

508
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,376
Then it’s true.

509
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:14,050
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

510
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,041
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.

511
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,686
Thank you for being here.

512
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,482
We’ve come across something
very interesting.

513
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,784
Have you ever seen this before?

514
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,689
- Doesn't ring a bell. Doctor?
- I've seen that before.

515
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,990
- The fish is the sign of life.
- That's interesting.

516
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,326
- And the snake is the sign of...
- Whoa.

517
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,265
The medallion.

518
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,763
You're gonna love this.

519
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,102
Now, it should have a serpent
on one side.

520
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,674
And a fish on the other.

521
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:47,308
If what you have is real, that is
the Holy Grail of Eastern mythology.

522
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,918
And maybe the secret to eternal life.

523
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,746
Sweet!

524
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,523
- Where'd you get the medallion?
- I recognize the fish.

525
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,822
- You got it from a kid, didn't you?
- Yes.

526
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,965
The legend says
every thousand years...

527
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,068
...a child is chosen that can bind the
halves together...

528
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,138
...and restore life to the dead.
You get that kid and the medallion...

529
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,400
...you're a god.
- That's nonsense.

530
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,304
- So where's the other half?
- Wait!

531
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,605
The ancient texts say that if you want
superhuman strength...

532
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,341
...and immortality,
you need both halves.

533
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,645
The only documented case
of a genuine resurrection...

534
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,380
You can't weigh it,
measure it, smoke it.

535
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,548
Look, ancient texts aren't fairy tales.

536
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,319
Thank you, professor. Doctor. Doctor.

537
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,156
- Cheerio, for now.
- Good luck.

538
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,494
Why would a young boy
have something like this?

539
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,740
This Snakehead chap, is he
after the medallion or the boy?

540
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,199
By the way,
take good care of that kid.

541
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,602
The medallion can not only give life,
it can take it away.

542
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,089
Okay, I’ll cover the front door,
call in for backup.

543
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,282
You go to the rear to Nicole’s
apartment as fast as you can.

544
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,791
Got it.

545
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,319
Sorry.

546
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,789
You know, for a little person,
you sure do eat a lot.

547
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,492
Still going?

548
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,290
What did you have?

549
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,727
Okay.

550
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,535
Here we go.

551
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,070
Try that.

552
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:56,803
That good?

553
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,975
You don’t like... You’re not...

554
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,650
One of my culinary skills...

555
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,259
...other than peeling fruit, of course...

556
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,857
...just so happens to be a toasted...

557
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:18,857
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich...

558
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:24,203
...which, I might add, Eddie could eat
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

559
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,940
Then again, he didn’t really
have any choice.

560
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,847
- Why?
- Because I can’t cook anything else.

561
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,892
I just can’t believe
that he’s really gone.

562
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:56,963
He’s not gone.

563
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,379
Jai...

564
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,389
...do you not understand that Eddie’s
not coming back?

565
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,058
I pulled him back.

566
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:25,859
Okay...

567
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,773
Jai, Eddie’s...

568
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:32,930
He...

569
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,983
Just hold on.

570
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:51,382
See?

571
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:56,859
Oh, my God.

572
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,556
Eddie?

573
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,215
Eddie.

574
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,322
Jai!

575
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,347
No!

576
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,710
Eddie!

577
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,271
You see? I told you he wasn’t dead.

578
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:44,695
The boy, sir.

579
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:45,863
Yes.

580
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:03,981
Welcome...

581
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,025
...my old friend.

582
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:14,961
So...

583
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,605
...a quick, painless death...

584
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,332
...followed by resurrection...

585
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,801
...immortality...

586
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,371
...and powers beyond your dreams.

587
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,044
Are you sure?

588
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,850
His order is ruled
by reverence for life.

589
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,555
My death before him
must be reversed.

590
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,558
And if it isn’t...

591
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:41,786
...kill him.

592
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,390
And then who would bring you back,
Chosen One?

593
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,132
Pitiful mortal.

594
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:27,732
So...

595
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,574
...I have no further use
for you, Chosen One.

596
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,308
You’re not immortal.

597
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:34,905
What?

598
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:38,611
To become immortal, you need
both halves of the medallion.

599
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,153
Where’s the other half?

600
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,280
Tell me!

601
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,521
- Nicole.
- Eddie.

602
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,565
It’s me. I’m fine, really.

603
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,058
I just...

604
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,862
I still don’t understand, Eddie,
because I was there...

605
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,270
...and I saw you, and...
- Nicole, it’s me.

606
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,213
You see, it’s just that I was at the
container and you were dead.

607
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,904
I mean, you were dead.

608
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:09,449
Nicole, the boy uses the medallion
to give life.

609
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,143
That’s why Snakehead took him.

610
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,721
With the boy and the medallion,
he could...

611
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,848
He could become like you?

612
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,854
Yes, but he needs
the whole medallion...

613
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,190
...and he only has half.

614
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,523
Look...

615
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,160
...this is a touching reunion.

616
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,771
We’re all glad that Eddie’s
amongst the living...

617
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,602
...but we still haven’t found
Snakehead’s helicopter.

618
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:36,939
Get online. Find anything
that was in the air in the last hour.

619
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:40,173
I don’t care if it was a bird, a plane
or bloody Superman.

620
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,249
No offense, old chap.

621
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,309
Eddie.

622
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,848
If he needs the other half, he’s
gonna come looking for you.

623
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,024
If he is looking for me...

624
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,957
...he’ll be looking for my partner.

625
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:00,624
Me?

626
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,700
My family.

627
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,570
My family.

628
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,139
Cool.

629
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,143
See, that’s not normal. I mean,
that’s not natural. What...?

630
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,017
Eddie, take my bike!

631
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,489
Thank God.

632
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,858
They’re all right.

633
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:06,724
Charlotte?

634
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,497
Charlotte? I have something
I have to tell you.

635
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,167
Yes, dear?

636
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,632
Eddie...

637
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,310
Watson! They’re here!

638
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,675
Go!

639
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,012
Go!

640
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,024
Charlotte, where are you going?

641
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,233
This is no time for cleaning.

642
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,999
Take your shield!

643
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,136
Watson!

644
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,811
- Are you all right, love?
- Yes, I’m fine, dear.

645
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,613
Catch!

646
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,812
Here. L"II lead them away.

647
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:02,748
Your wife?

648
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,487
What the...?

649
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,530
There you are. Quick. Quick.
That’s a good boy.

650
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,799
Now, listen. Guns are very dangerous
things, all right? Right.

651
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,339
How dare you shoot...

652
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,616
...at my...

653
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,479
...wife!

654
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,724
My Lord.

655
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,075
Where’d he go?

656
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:05,777
We meet again...

657
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,013
...Eddie Yang.

658
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,054
Where’s the boy?

659
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,096
My guest is no concern of yours.

660
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,636
All that matters is that you have the
other half of the medallion.

661
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,371
Don’t run, Eddie!

662
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,640
You can’t hide from me!

663
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,555
The medallion is mine!

664
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,800
You think it’s a game?

665
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,458
Well, let’s play!

666
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,955
We’re the same, you and I.

667
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,329
What a pity. What a waste.

668
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,496
You don’t know
what powers you have.

669
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,095
Destiny calls.

670
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,763
He’s sleeping. At least, I think that’s
what he’s doing.

671
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,241
He doesn’t even look like he’s
breathing.

672
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,567
The boy!

673
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,941
Oh, God, I wish
you wouldn’t do that.

674
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,707
Eddie, you’re all right.

675
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,811
The boy’s in danger.

676
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,282
He’s going to kill him. Right?!

677
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,754
Snakehead has taken the boy
to Raven’s Keep.

678
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,449
I told you everything I know.

679
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,649
I did.

680
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,556
We need to move fast.

681
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,427
Of course I can fly this thing.
I built it myself.

682
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,932
You take the bike.
L"II guide you from the air.

683
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,400
I’m driving.

684
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,901
That’s Raven’s Keep.

685
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,403
It’s five miles away.

686
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,083
You should wash your hands.

687
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,353
Come on.

688
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,613
Nicole.

689
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,576
Be careful.

690
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,111
You too.

691
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:05,177
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Where’s the boy?

692
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,954
- Let’s get out of here!
- Move!

693
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:51,292
You cowards!

694
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,079
Watson. Watson!

695
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,516
Are you crazy?

696
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:16,281
Be careful.

697
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:18,882
Interpol. Freeze.

698
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,128
Jai, are you all right?

699
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:36,836
There she is! Get her!

700
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,593
Excuse me.

701
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,862
You looking for something?

702
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,974
Interpol! Freeze!

703
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,778
Interpol! Freeze!

704
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,276
Interpol! Free...

705
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,778
Jai, thank God.

706
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,422
You’re in danger.

707
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,319
It’s over.

708
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,016
You’re safe now.

709
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,387
I don’t think so.

710
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,153
No, it’s all right.

711
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,059
Run!

712
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:14,800
For your lives.

713
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,747
It’s not nice to take things
that don’t belong to you.

714
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,887
Fetch.

715
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,446
My brother...

716
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,116
...don’t be sentimental.

717
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,287
It’s so unnecessary.

718
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,652
It’s so human.

719
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,390
So normal.

720
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,792
You and I will live forever.

721
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,091
We are the lords of time.

722
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,200
We can take whatever we choose.

723
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,997
I mean, what difference can a single
human life like hers make to us?

724
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,506
We are immortal.

725
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:24,043
Let me show you.

726
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,424
Eddie, use the medallion
to end the life that it gave.

727
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:10,632
Can you?

728
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:14,902
It’s your turn.

729
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:12,755
What’s that for?

730
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,697
That, Eddie Yang,
is for not catching me.

731
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,378
And that, Eddie Yang, is for not
catching me.

732
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,714
Interpol! Freeze!

733
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,960
Isn’t that lovely?

734
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,389
Of course...

735
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,362
...when he came back, he was naked.

736
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,496
I mean, completely starkers.
Not a stitch.

737
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,695
I’m not complaining, mind you.

738
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,735
Listen, I have this cough.

739
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:56,207
I think it’s quite serious.
Honestly, I could snuff at any point.

740
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:59,176
I don’t suppose you’d consider
a rub on your medallion?

741
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:00,871
I really am. Hello?

742
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,250
It’s very bad...

743
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:06,552
Very bad. You...

744
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,916
Please, the med... One quick rub.

745
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,785
That’s all. Oh, the medallion.

746
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,725
Quick. Give me the medallion.

747
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:18,288
Give it.

748
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,059
All right.

749
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,007
It was only a tickle anyway.

750
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,435
Come with me.

751
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:30,633
Wait!

752
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:32,812
Nicole! Eddie!

753
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,176
You can’t leave me here.

754
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:44,352
Goodbye!

755
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,787
Okay, that wasn’t scary at all.

756
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,526
He walked through a vortex
to the next universe.

757
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:56,399
I’m going this way.

758
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,016
- Quiet on the set. Are cameras ready?
- Cameras are ready.

759
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,778
Jackie, Claire. And action.

760
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:13,943
I’m sorry.

761
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:17,249
Can you overlap
that line for me?

762
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,451
Eddie Yang. I knew there
couldn’t be two of you.

763
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:24,461
- Will you say action, or am I just...?
- I did. Okay, here we go.

764
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:25,929
And action.

765
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:30,193
Three months and not so much
as a phone call?

766
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,163
That made me so nervous.
I slapped you so hard.

767
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,673
- Come on! Oh, my God!
- In the middle...!

768
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,335
- I got slapped for nothing!
- I’m so sorry.

769
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:41,812
- I am so sorry. I’m so sorry.
- I can’t believe it.

770
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,450
- Oh, no!
- Claire.

771
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,553
Jackie, I’m so sorry.
That rea... That hurt me.

772
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,423
- You should continue filming!
- Oh, I didn’t know!

773
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,459
- Now I got another one!
- Oh, no!

774
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:55,826
- That was really bad.
- Try it again.

775
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,520
Let’s go.

776
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,526
Let’s move.

777
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,163
Take one.

778
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:03,497
Eddie.

779
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,832
All those things that I said...

780
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,738
I was right there.

781
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,068
- Seven, take three.

782
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:14,339
God bless, Eddie.

783
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,420
Action!

784
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,561
Cut!

785
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:32,622
Cut.

786
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,725
Take one.

787
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,995
You... Now, how...?

788
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,665
It’s Giscard.

789
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,776
- Really? What about Snakehead?
- Snakehead is not here yet.

790
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,208
Is he not here?
What about Ken?

791
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,079
- Yeah. Ken is...
- Pete? Pete?

792
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,580
Pete is just right beside me.

793
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:50,979
That’s it. We’re fine.

794
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,553
- Now, that’s...
- Somebody let Jackie in.

795
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,290
Here’s the plan.

796
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:00,485
We have to...

797
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:02,452
Whoops.

798
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:03,892
I got it wrong.

799
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:09,002
It’s this way.

800
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,770
Oh, sorry. It’s the other way.

801
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,298
Oh, damn.

802
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,008
Oh, I missed.

803
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,669
Watson.

804
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,883
- Cut. Print.
- Phone.

805
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:24,348
- A-camera.
- Action.

806
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:26,953
Watson. So many things are going on.

807
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:32,092
- Marker.
- Come on.

808
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,625
- Marker.
- One more.

809
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,086
Watson.

810
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,856
Sorry. What? It’s... No, you... No.

811
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,058
- Again.
- Sorry.

812
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,362
Marker!

813
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:48,904
- Cut.
- Cut!

814
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:52,611
I want ice cream.

815
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,250
Cut!

816
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:04,413
Cut!

817
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,524
Slate X67, take one coming up.

818
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,061
- A-marker.
- Like a woman.

819
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,759
That’s it. That’s it. Okay.

820
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,664
It’s just down there.

821
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,270
Down.

822
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,064
Then the bottom.

823
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,764
Then the bottom.

824
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:25,471
- Sorry, Jackie.
- What’s this? "The bottom."

825
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,280
- Marker.
- Move!

826
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,212
Wait, wait!

827
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:41,788
Oh, shit.

828
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:44,493
Nicole, the boy used the meda...

829
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,793
Very good. Cut. Cut.

830
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,096
The dog barking.

831
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:52,398
Yeah, I heard it.

832
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:54,166
Go. Go away.

833
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,067
And action.

834
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:57,871
Interpol! Freeze!

835
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,035
Cut.

836
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:01,875
A-camera.

837
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,084
In case of emergency...

838
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:06,610
...the exits are here...

839
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:07,946
...here...

840
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:10,221
...and here.

841
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:16,622
- I slapped you.
- Again.

842
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,823
- Sorry. I’m sorry.
- Oh, my God!

843
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,400
- It was meant to be fake. Sorry.
- You do on purpose.

844
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:22,866
Are you doing on purpose?

845
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,937
Try it again, Claire.
A little harder.

846
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:26,198
It drives me crazy.

847
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
