00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,507
由路易斯·莱恩为您带来星球日报新闻
Daily Planet News with Lois Lane.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,136
今日头条：海中的正义
Today's top story: justice by sea.

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,767
看来黑蝠鲼是今日的收获
Looks like Black Manta is the catch of the day.

4
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,478
陆上的正义
Justice by land.

5
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,357
噢，这只企鹅看来需要一个冰袋了
Oh. This Penguin is going to need an ice pack.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,568
哈哈. - 啊！
Ha-ha. - Aah!

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,947
太空的正义
Justice in space.

8
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:36,328
我打赌塞尼斯托现在已经意识到自己处境危机
I bet Sinestro is now aware of the gravity of his situation.

9
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:40,791
我真希望这些超级反派们都买过保险，因为他们确实挺需要的
I hope supervillains have health insurance
because it looks like they're gonna need it.

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:45,212
自从数月之前正义联盟组建以来，他们至今没有输过一场
Since the Justice League's formation months ago, they have yet to lose a battle.

11
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,090
从今往后，如果你想看任何超级反派的镜头...
From now on, if you wanna see any supervillain footage...</i>

12
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,219
你就得去看看世界最佳滑稽节目
you'll have to watch The World's Most Ridiculous and Embarrassing Videos.

13
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,845
回到日常报道
Back to the actual news.

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,015
军方的核量子反应堆今日开始运行
The Army's prototype nuketron reactor began operating today.

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,602
这座实验发电厂将会成为比联合发电更多的能量.
This experimental power plant will generate more energy than the combined-

16
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,187
够了
Enough of that.

17
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,108
抛开她糟糕的语法和烂透的报道不谈...
Despite her bad grammar and terrible reporting...

18
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,902
「无畏的」路易斯·莱恩是对的啊
the intrepid Lois Lane is correct.

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,989
正义联盟让我们失业了
The Justice League is putting us out of business.

20
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,076
你描绘的情景比马里亚纳海沟底还黑暗啊，卢瑟
You paint a picture as black as the bottom
of the Mariana Trench, Luthor.

21
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,370
显然事情并没有那么糟糕
Surely things can't be that bad.

22
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,248
不，蝠鲼，卢瑟是对的
No, Manta, Luthor is right.

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:26,461
我们的未来十分悲观并且将会失败重重
Our glass is half empty and the full half is full of failure.

24
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:31,717
过去，我们每人和英雄单打独斗时还有点机会赢
In the past, each of us fighting a lone hero had some chance of winning.

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,678
但现在，对抗他们全部？
But now, against all of them?

26
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,139
我跟你说...
I say to you...

27
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,601
如果世界上的超级罪犯想要生存下去...
that if the supercriminals of the world want to survive...

28
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:45,689
我们必须要团结起来形成 非正义的联盟，
we too must band together and form, not a league of justice...

29
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,190
成立一个军团，
but a legion.

30
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,027
毁灭军团
A Legion of Doom.

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,670
噢，真恶心
Ah, sheesh.

32
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,047
他们上钩了
They went for it.

33
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,717
一切按我的计划进行
Everything is going according to my plan.

34
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,220
你的计划，卢瑟？
Your plan, Luthor?

35
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:24,061
我允许你加入我的计划是因为这能助我的目的一臂之力
I'm allowing your participation in my plan because it serves my purpose.

36
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,854
召集他们
Summon them.

37
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,441
把这世上最卑鄙无耻的恶棍们都召集到这里...
Summon the world's vilest villains here...

38
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,236
到这毁灭大厅...
to this, this Hall of Doom...

39
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:38,659
开始我征服地球的计划
to begin my conquest of the Earth.

40
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,252
最终，正义联盟败给了达克赛德
And so the Justice League falls to Darkseid.

41
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,130
Booyah!

42
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,804
投降吧，笨蛋
Surrender now, Dork-sew.

43
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,308
你可挡不住我的力量，孩子
You are no match for my power, child.

44
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,601
「抬」头
Heads up.

45
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,483
糊你熊脸
In your face.

46
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,958
世界最强钢骨！嗷！
World's best cyborg! Ow!

47
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,462
跟着我一起摇摆
I put the boogie in the berg

48
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,088
钢骨
The Cyborg

49
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,049
你救了我的命，钢骨.
You saved my life, Cyborg.

50
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,302
蝙蝠侠的命  - 嗯哼
Batman's life. - Mm-hm.

51
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,013
令人惊叹，我们应该多出去玩玩. - 喔！
Impressive. We should hang out more.  - Whoo!

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,057
当然，蝙蝠侠，那真是太棒了
Sure, Batman. That would be great.

53
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,477
我在蝙蝠洞里有个台球桌，而且...
I've got a pool table back at the Batcave and--

54
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,604
等等，啥？台球？台球听起来棒极了
Wait, what? Pools? Pools sound great.

55
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,566
我挺喜欢玩台球的...呃，哈？
I'd just totally love to play pool with... Uh, huh?

56
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,944
噢，我去，刚刚那是个梦？
Oh, dang, it was a dream?

57
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,948
噢，不，不，不.我睡过头了
Oh, no, no, no. I overslept.

58
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,241
我要迟到了
I'm gonna be late.

59
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,160
我会议要迟到了
I'm gonna be late for the meeting.

60
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,578
又一次
Again.

61
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,624
该死的缆线
Stupid cord.

62
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,131
你迟到了，钢骨
You're late, Cyborg.

63
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,133
额，嗨，大家好啊
Uh, hi, everybody.

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,804
维克，难道你体内没有内置一个原子钟吗？
Vic, don't you have like an atomic clock built into you?

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,139
抱歉...嘿嘿...我只是...
Sorry about-- Heh-heh. I ju--

66
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,352
我晚起是因为我忙一个秘密项目，可以...
I was up late working on a secret project, which--

67
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,313
不要介意了，年轻的钢骨，你还没来的时候我们就开始了
Think nothing of it, young Cyborg. We started without you.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,942
等了好几百万年后，我感觉大概有五百万年
After waiting a million years, which feels like 5 million years to me.

69
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,887
超级速度带来的坏处
The downside of super-speed.

69
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,487
放松，闪电侠，吃个甜甜圈吧
Relax，Flash.Have a doughnut
70
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,489
哦，天哪
Oh, boy.

71
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,074
嘿，等一下
Hey, wait a minute.

72
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,618
只剩一个甜甜圈了，妈妈总是教育我要有礼貌
There's only one. Mom raised me to have manners.

73
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,246
这个甜甜圈应该给你，神奇女侠
That doughnut should go to you,Wonder Woman.

74
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,331
好吧，你真是有绅士风度，闪电侠，但是...
Well, that's very chivalrous, Flash, but--

75
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,876
噗，他？绅士风度？你在开玩笑？
Pfft. Him? Chivalrous? Are you kidding?

76
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,837
就因为给了你一个甜甜圈？
Offering you a doughnut?

77
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,423
哇哦！ - 公主殿下应该拥有一个王座
Whoa! - A princess should have a throne.

78
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,427
哈尔，我是神奇女侠，我可不需要什么特殊待遇
Hal, I'm Wonder Woman,I certainly don't require special

79
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,721
来咯.世界各地的美味佳肴
There. Delicacies from around the world.

80
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,723
总有食物适合公主的口味
Food fit for the palate of a princess.

81
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,770
好了，都坐下，你们俩
Okay, sit down, both of you.

82
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,689
坐下
Sit.

83
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,319
如你们所知，今天是选举日
As you know, it's election day.

84
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,406
我们要选出一位新的英雄来领导正义联盟
We'll be voting for a new hero to lead the Justice League.

85
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,076
请吧，各位，用心投票
Please, everyone, vote with your heart.

86
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,538
我有异议，钢铁之躯
I beg to differ, Man of Steel.

87
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,666
要知道为做出艰难决定的候选人投票
You see Vote for the candidate who makes hard decisions...

88
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,294
是基于冰冷的数据和可靠的自觉
based on cold data and infallible instincts.

89
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,798
现在，我建议我们用投票选举
Now, I suggest we take that vote.

90
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,759
我投给神奇女侠一票 - 我可连竞选都没参加
I vote for Wonder Woman. - I'm not even running.

91
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,137
她是候选人的话我也给她一票，两票
She's a write-in and I'm voting for her.Twice.

92
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,934
我投票给超人，这位实际参选了的人
My vote goes to Superman,who is actually running.

93
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,690
我投票给黑暗骑士
My vote goes to the Dark Knight.

94
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,942
无意冒犯啦，超人 - 哦，没事没事
No offense, Superman.- Oh, none taken.

95
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,737
嗯.看来是平局
Hmm. Looks like a tie...

96
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:48,158
毕竟我和超人毫无疑都会投票给自己的
since Superman and I undoubtedly voted for ourselves.

97
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,619
我可从来都没想过
That never even occurred to me.

98
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,078
我投你一票
I voted for you.

99
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,500
所以赢家是 蝙蝠侠
And the winner is Batman.

100
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,086
太好了，黑暗骑士.来击个掌
All right, Dark Knight. Up high.

101
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,963
恭喜，蝙蝠侠
Congratulations, Batman.

102
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,467
系统里投你票的人包括我保证都绝对相信
The people have spoken and my absolute faith in the system assures me...

103
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,985
你是一个正确的领导者
that you are clearly the correct leader.

104
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,766
危险警报
The trouble alert.

105
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,226
大都会第一国家银行发生抢劫案
A robbery at Metropolis First National Bank.

106
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,430
有什么指令，主管？
What's the word, chief?

106
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:19,230
闪电侠，指令就是「出发」
The word, Flash, is "go."

107
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,412
不许动
Freeze!

108
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,122
站在那不要动，小丑
Hold it right there, Joker.

109
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,792
我不是小丑，我是魔术师
I'm not the Joker. I'm the Trickster.

110
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,085
完全不一样好吗
Totally different.

111
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,754
小丑会用一罐子蛇来攻击吗
Would the Joker attack with a can of snakes?

112
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,298
额.会吧，他很可能真会这么做 - 很像他的作风
Yeah. Yeah. He probably would.- Sounds like him.

113
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,385
哇哦！- 啊！
Whoa!- Aah!

114
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,514
哈？ - 嘿，小丑把我们的车炸飞了
Huh? - Hey, the Joker just blew up our car.

115
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,683
不，那甚至都不算一个笑话
No. That's not even a joke.

116
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,812
这是一个魔术，就像这个魔术鞋一样，小丑可没有魔术鞋
It's a trick. Like trick shoes.
The Joker doesn't have trick shoes.

117
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,272
我是魔术师，魔~术~师~
I'm the Trickster. The Trickster.

118
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,197
啊，我们的老朋友，魔术师
Ah. Our old friend, the Trickster.

119
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,825
终于，有认识我的了
Finally. He gets me.

120
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,161
我知道他不是我们的朋友，我只是在讽刺
I know he isn't really our friend. I was being ironic.

121
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,124
现在是我的下一个魔术：消失魔法
And now for my next trick: a disappearing act.

122
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,381
我可不是这货魔术的粉丝
I'm not a fan of this guy's tricks.

123
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,174
那边
There.

124
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,720
正义联盟，分散开找他
Justice League, split up and find him.

125
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,516
并小心他那些陈旧的魔术
And watch out for his corny tricks.

126
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,852
你现在无处可逃了，魔术师
No escape for you now, Trickster.

127
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,520
我会搞定他的，闪电侠
I got this, Flash.

128
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,023
不，是我会搞定
No, I got this.

129
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,823
书中最古老的魔法
The oldest trick in the book.

130
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,827
等着看神奇女侠听到你被香蕉绊倒了是什么反应吧.啊！
Wait till Wonder Woman hears that you fell for a banana. Unh!

131
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,622
没有他的踪迹
No sign of him.

132
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,502
你躲不过我的透视眼的，魔术师
You can't hide from my x-ray vision, Trickster.

133
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,172
我找到他了
I found him.

134
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,215
你到此为止了，魔术师
End of the line for you, Trickster.

135
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,177
嗯？
Huh?

136
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,773
我们很快就会把你从这个下水道里找出来的，魔术师
We'll flush you out of this sewer soon enough, Trickster.

137
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,734
我的感应器在这条隧道检测到动静
My sensors are picking up movement in this tunnel.

138
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,403
有东西在那里
There's something down there.

139
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,868
哇哦
Whoa!

140
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:41,664
看来我的蝙蝠牙线该派上用场了
Looks like a job for my Bat-dental floss.

141
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,006
你已经没有伎俩了，魔术师
You've gimmicked your last gimmick, Trickster.

142
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,342
你的诡计就是累赘
Your gags are a drag.

143
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,803
你已经无计可施了
You're bag of tricks just ran out.

144
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,013
你的魔术将给你带来一场
Your tricks just treated you to a trip...

145
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,308
直达黑门监狱的旅途
Right to Blackgate Prison.

146
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,353
正义联盟的又一场胜利，来击个掌
Another win for the Justice League. High five.

147
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,480
什么五个？ - 呃
Five what? - Ugh.

148
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,232
投降吧，魔术师
Come quietly, Trickster.

149
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,859
你们要么让我走.
You either let me go...

150
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,280
要么我就要释放我手上的气体
or we're gonna have a smelly situation on our hands.

151
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,740
我来处理
I got this.

152
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,575
喔
Ooh!

153
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,662
现在该解决这个 - 钢骨，等等
And now to dispose of it.- Cyborg, wait.

154
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,914
嗯？
Huh?

155
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,253
啊-哦
Uh-oh.

156
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,173
我做到了，booyah~
I did it. Booyah!

157
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,844
恶...这是啥味儿？
Ew! What's that smell?

158
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,389
喔，真难闻 - 喔，这真糟糕
Oh, that's nasty. - Oh, that's bad.

159
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,850
那是什么？
What is that?

160
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,396
看上去钢骨要挨蝙蝠好一顿说了
Looks like Cyborg's about to get a Bat lecture.

161
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,065
幸好我不是他
Glad I'm not in his shoes.

162
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,614
我刚才就是想告诉你这个，钢骨
I was trying to tell you, Cyborg.

163
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,950
那是个臭气弹
That was a stink bomb.

164
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,244
现在整个街道都是恶臭
Now this whole section of the city stinks.

165
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,164
更别提你们了，咻...
Not to mention you guys. Phew.

166
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,125
嘿嘿，看来我笑到了最后啊，正义联盟
Heh-heh. Looks like I got the last laugh, Justice League.

167
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,753
呃
Ew.

168
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,548
呃，对不起？
Uh, Oops?

169
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,388
欢迎来到毁灭军团
Welcome to the Legion of Doom.

170
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,141
毁灭障碍训练场
Obstacle Course of Doom.

171
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:28,354
打败正义联盟不是小事，因此我们军团只要
Defeating the Justice League is no small
matter so our legion must be comprised...

172
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,274
选拔出技巧最熟练的恶棍
of only the most skilled of scoundrels.

173
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,445
你们的任务：在训练场上活下来，碾碎你们的竞争者
Your task: survive the course, crush your competition...

174
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,655
向军团证明你的邪恶
validate your villainy for the legion.

175
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,158
这里没有规则
There are no rules!

176
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,368
什么？等一下
What? Wait a minute.

177
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,289
好吧，有一条规则，军团成员必须参加总部
Okay, there is one rule. Club members have to be able to attend...

178
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,250
各项会议和社交事宜
meetings and social events inside our headquarters...

179
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,754
我看有的人估计连门都不能进来
and I see someone here who won't even fit through the door.

180
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,714
抱歉，巨化女
Sorry, Giganta.

181
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,592
规则就是规则
Rules are rules.

182
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:09,187
好了，闲话少说，让我们马上开始吧
All right, now without further ado,
I'd like to get things started.

183
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,565
他们出发了
And they're off.

184
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,486
第一关是弹射...
This first section should put a little spring in their step.

185
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,322
和坠落，哈哈
And a little fall. Ha-ha-ha.

186
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,698
豹女一马当先
Here comes Cheetah.

187
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,746
看来猫也不总是能够优雅落地嘛
Looks like cats don't always land on their feet after all.

188
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,504
猩猩格鲁德荡过了机械鳄鱼
Gorilla Grodd swings past the Robe-gators.

189
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,216
但接下来这关会让他困在香蕉中
But this next section is going to drive him bananas.

190
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:48,393
哦，人蝠都快被打成人蚊了，哈哈哈，人蚊
Ooh. Man-Bat swatted like a man-gnat. Ha-ha-ha. Man-gnat.

191
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,561
我们来到了致命甜甜圈
We're coming up to the Deadly Doughnuts.

192
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,188
豹女掉下去了
And Cheetah gets dunked.

193
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,149
小丑来得正好刚好赶上公交
Joker's right on time to catch the bus.

194
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,653
这关是一头怪兽，
Ha-ha-ha. This course is a monster...

195
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,698
看来企鹅人的全力也就这样了
and it looks like it just got the best of Penguin.

196
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,054
这真是太逗了
That was priceless.

197
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,473
太棒了，太棒了
Too good. Too good.

198
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,142
比赛结束了
This contest is over.

199
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,813
等等，少了个选手
Wait a minute. There's one competitor missing.

200
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,116
U额，这货是谁来着？
h, who is this guy again?

201
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,536
终结者-丧钟
Deathstroke the Terminator.

202
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,825
-老牛逼了 -也许他才该来当老大
- Most impressive.
-Maybe he should be the leader.

203
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,035
谢谢您了
Thank you.

204
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,870
Huh?

205
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,171
我们赢啦
We made it.

206
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,632
不幸的是，我们只有六个停车位...
Unfortunately, we only have six parking spots...

207
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,300
所以，拜拜咯
so goodbye.

208
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,643
恭喜，你们入伙了
Congratulations. You're in.

209
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,396
欢迎我们的新同伴
And welcome to all our new members.

210
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,398
收起你那一套吧，莱秃
Keep your kudos, Lex.

211
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,942
我们只是想犯点罪而已
What we want is crime.

212
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,028
那就去犯吧，豹女
And so you shall have it, Cheetah.

213
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:10,493
这个政府秘密设施被称为52区
This is a covert government facility known as Area 52.

214
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,162
额，你是说51区？
Don't you mean Area 51?

215
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,499
旧的51区已经关了
The old Area 51 was shut down.

216
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,919
这是新52
This is the new 52.

217
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,046
这个顶级机密的政府基地
It is a top secret government base...

218
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:27,510
藏满了高级实验武器以及没收的外星科技
full of advanced experimental weaponry
and confiscated alien technology.

219
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,597
他们不想这些东西落入坏人之手
They don't want any of it
falling into the wrong hands.

220
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,144
当然这里的坏人，嘿嘿，指的就是我们
And by the wrong hands, heh-heh，they mean our hands.

221
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,439
正是如此
Quite so.

222
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,901
毁灭军团，邪恶全开吧
Legion of Doom, prepare for evil.

223
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,611
耶
Yeah.

224
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,035
啊！哦！
Aah! Ooh!

225
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,081
钢骨的功能停止运转了吗？
Have Cyborg's functions terminated?

226
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,500
没有，电子机器人，我没死
<i>No, (By-bot, I'm not dead.</i>

227
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,337
我想给正义大厅升下级，但是有点分心了
I was working on some new upgrades
for the hall, but I'm a little distracted.

228
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,256
钢骨有什么故障吗
What is Cyborg's malfunction?

229
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,717
额，我今天搞了个又大又臭的麻烦出来，
Well, I kind of made a big, stinky mess today.

230
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,261
我不觉得其他人现在想看见我
I'm not sure the others want me around right now.

231
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,389
钢骨把电子机器人设计成进行清洁和做家务
Cyborg designed Cy-bot to clean and perform chores.

232
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,267
电子机器人会清理好钢骨又大又臭的麻烦的
Cy-bot will clean Cyborg's big, stinky mess.

233
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,482
你说得对，电子机器人，
You're right, Cy-bot.

234
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,151
我需要自己清理我的麻烦
I need to clean up my own messes.

235
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,569
救命
Help.

236
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,408
嘿，伙计们，那个我想道歉...哇？！
Hey, guys, I just wanted to apolog...Wha--

237
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,536
哇哦
Whoa.

238
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,371
你们换新制服了
You guys got new outfits!

239
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,501
超人，你把内裤穿在里面了？
Superman, you're wearing your underwear on the inside?

240
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,169
不错的选择
Nice choice.

241
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,089
还有，蝙蝠侠，黑暗骑士的闪亮新战甲
And, Batman, shiny new armor for the Dark Knight.

242
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,093
神奇女侠，还是一如既往的爱国，但是更低调了
Wonder Woman, patriotic as always, but more understated.

243
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,515
闪电侠和哈尔...额...你们俩没变化啊
Flash and Hal, well...You haven't changed a bit.

244
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,683
我的制服完美无暇
My costume is an indestructible construct.

245
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,352
为何要破坏完美的结构
And why mess with perfection?

246
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,728
我说得对吧，公主殿下？
Am I right, princess?

247
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,941
噗.你带着那拖累你的珠宝才能坚不可摧吧
Pfft. You'd better be indestructible
with that jewelry slowing you down.

248
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
你可比不上这完美突显出「世上最快的人」的制服
You can't beat a costume that screams "fastest man alive."

249
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,822
比世上其他人都快的人，你怎么还不闪到一边去？
So why don't you brush off, faster than any man alive?

250
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,866
干什...？嘿. - 嘿
- What the--? Hey. -Heh.

251
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,953
哇哦，哇哦，我不明白，到底发生了什么
Whoa, whoa, I don't understand. What's going on here?

252
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,249
我们的旧制服沾上了永久的恶臭而毁了
Our former costumes were ruined with a permanent stench.

253
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,252
它有损我们作为犯罪斗士的效率
It compromised our effectiveness as crime-fighters.

254
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:28,506
对，因为我你们的旧制服才都会变臭的
Right, because it's my fault your old ones got all stinky.

255
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,258
没有的事
Nonsense.

256
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,884
我们都需要改变
We all needed a change.

257
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,554
要不我们也给你来点新东西？
Why don't we come up with something new for you too?

258
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,847
-我们不能，神奇女侠 -为什么？
- We can't, Wonder Woman. -Why?

259
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,642
钢骨不穿衣服的啊
Cyborg doesn't wear clothes.

260
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,858
-有警报 - 正义联盟，这里是莱恩将军
- The trouble alert.- Justice League, this is General Lane.

261
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,029
52区，一个顶级机密的政府机构指挥官
commanding officer of Area 52,
a top secret government installation.

262
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,157
我们正遭到未知人员的攻击
We are under attack from person or persons unknown.

263
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,244
但是很有可能是外星人
But it's probably alien.

264
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,789
您说的好像是什么脏东西一样，将军
You say that like it's a bad thing, general.

265
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,875
赶紧过来并采取...
Just get over here and take a...

266
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,212
快走吧，我光站这感觉自己开始变老了
Let's go. I can feel myself
growing older just standing here.

267
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,089
别着急，闪电侠
Not so fast, Flash.

268
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,924
蝙蝠侠是我们正式选举的领导人，
Batman is the duly-elected leader.

269
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
要由他来决定
This is his call.

270
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,139
准备起飞标枪号
Prepare the Javelin for launch.

271
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,480
打起精神，伙计们，我们进入了52区上空
Look alive, team, we've entered Area 52 airspace.

272
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:31,360
噢，一个政府绝密基地，藏满了各种绝密科技，
Ooh. A top secret government compound
loaded with top secret technology...

273
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,571
坐落于一个绝密的位置
and located in a top secret location.

274
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,573
你是怎么找到它的？
How'd you even know where to find it?

275
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,199
-我是...-...蝙蝠侠！
-I'm...  -Batman.

276
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,076
对吧，我懂的
Right? Gotcha.

277
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,049
<i>Hmm.</i>

278
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,727
这很安静
It's quiet.

279
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,896
太安静了
Too quiet.

280
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,857
除了这特雷门的电子音乐
Except for the theremin music.

281
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,652
钢骨，能把它关了吗?
Cyborg, would please stop it?

282
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,114
不好意思，我只是有点小紧...卡车！
Sorry, I was just having a little bit a...Truck!

283
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,374
欢迎你们来被打败，正义联盟
Welcome to your defeat, Justice League.

284
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,629
败在毁灭军团的手里
Defeat at the hands of the Legion of Doom.

286
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,258
呃，毁灭军团?
Ah! Legion of Doom?

287
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,928
-石化的潘多拉 - 反派们联手了?
- Petrified Pandora.
-Villains working together?

288
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,764
-我可没想到会这样 - 我想到了
- I did not see that coming. -I did.

289
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,350
干掉他们
Destroy them.

290
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,481
正义联盟，行动！
Justice League, move out.

291
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,483
你们听到了队长的话了，行动吧
You heard our captain. Let's move.

292
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,570
超人，你的联盟比不过...
Superman, your league is no match...

293
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:02,660
毁灭军团
for the Legion of Doom!

294
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,039
你该加入个差劲枪法军团什么的
You should've joined the Legion of Bad Marksmanship.

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,128
毁灭军团会取你项上人头
The Legion of Doom will have your heads.

296
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,466
长尾巴的，你输了
Tails. You lose.

297
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,520
站住，你这个烦躁轻浮的小子
Hold still, you fidgety flibbertigibbet.

298
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,441
烦躁轻浮小子?烦躁轻浮是个啥?
Flibbertigibbet? What's a flibbertigibbet?

299
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,650
噢
Ooh!

300
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,154
哦，不
Oh, no.

301
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,202
你是躲不掉的，格鲁德
It's no use trying to hide from me, Grodd.

302
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,372
谁躲了，
Who's hiding?

303
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,834
我只是在熟悉我的新座驾
I'm just getting a feel for my new ride.

304
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,212
嘿，那下有点痛
Hey, I felt that.

305
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,972
学校开始授课了，年轻人
School's in session, youngster.

306
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,683
好啊，这是我的作业
Well, here's my homework.

307
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,018
噢
Ooh!

308
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,692
下课
Class dismissed.

309
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,944
嘿，塞尼斯托
Hey, Sinestro.

310
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,863
迎接你最可怕的噩梦吧
Here comes your worst nightmare.

311
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,576
我最可怕的噩梦是穿着内裤在公众场合演讲
My worst nightmare involves public speaking in my underwear.

312
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,205
你还差得远呢
You're not even close.

313
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,501
欢迎乘坐干草机特快列车
All aboard the Haymaker Express.

314
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,299
哈哈，票已检
Ha-ha. Ticket punched.

315
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,219
尝尝这个，你个寄生弹球
Take this, you parasitic pinball.

316
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,429
没打中，差一点，
Missed me. Nice try.

317
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,181
下次好运吧
Better luck next time.

318
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,483
全中，输家
Full tilt, loser.

319
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,948
现在轮到你这个半人类
Now to finish off the half-man.

320
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:10,496
机器人，这就是你的极限了吗?
So, Robot Man, is that all you can do?

321
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,541
当真正的人类在干正事时呆在一边什么都不做?
Sit there while the real men do the work?

322
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,091
该死的电梯，
Stupid elevator.

323
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,844
快啊，打开，打开
Come on. Open. Open.

324
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,722
不可能，我都把这玩意开到11级了
Impossible. I have this thing turned up to 11.

325
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,311
丢掉你那没用的地球科技吧，卢瑟
Forget your worthless Earth technology, Luthor.

326
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,231
走这个轰爆音通道
Enter this boom tube.

327
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:42,361
这是一个由父盒控制的跨维度通道
It is an inter-dimensional gateway controlled by this Father Box.

328
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,073
另一个达克赛德的礼物
Yet another gift of Darkseid.

329
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,787
为什么你在毁灭大厅的时候不直接用爆音通道把我们送过来
Why didn't you just boom tube us here from the Hall of Doom?

330
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,916
我暂时还不想让你们军团的人知道我的存在
It is not my will that your legion knows of me, yet.

331
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,794
进来，你在浪费时间
Come. You are wasting time.

332
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,463
要是我们不是飞过来的话还可以省一大把时间呢
Could've saved a lot of time if we hadn't flown here.

333
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,008
从屠杀沼泽飞过来花了三小时...，
It was a three-hour flight from Slaughter Swamp...

334
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,177
而且黑蝠鲼的飞船闻起来就像死鱼一样
and Manta's ship smells like a wharf.

335
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,353
了不起的科技，有了这个我就可以...
Impressive technology. With these tubes, I could take over the--

336
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,942
你就可以利用我给你的工具征服这个可怜的世界
You will take over this pitiful world with the tools I give you.

337
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,863
我很乐意接受你的援助，暂时
I am happy to accept your aid. For now.

338
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,531
你说啥
What was that?

339
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,535
噢，我说我很乐意把创可贴贴牛身上...
Oh, I said I like to put Band-Aids on cows.

340
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,371
地下13层，硬件，内衣，
<i>Sub level 13. Hardware. Underwear.</i>

341
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,332
禁止的外星科技
<i>Forbidden alien technology.</i>

342
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,251
站着别动你这外星怪物
Hold it right there, you alien weirdo.

343
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,796
我就知道，外星人想要统治这个星球
I knew it. Aliens trying to take over the planet.

344
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,926
对不住了，有我萨姆·莱恩将军在就没戏
Well, sorry, pal, not on General Sam Lane's watch.

345
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,345
多么离奇有趣
How quaint.

346
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,850
修正，硬件，内衣，
<i>Correction. Hardware. Underwear.</i>

347
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,186
不省人事的偏执狂将军
<i>Unconscious paranoid generals.</i>

348
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,480
密封罐就那边，
The cylinder is right over there.

349
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,482
去吧
Go.

350
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,322
难以置信
Incredible.

351
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,494
啊，有人记下来车牌号了吗
Unh.Did somebody get the license number?

352
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,374
你的宇宙宝石搞不定吗，哈尔？
Oh, is your space jewelry not cutting it,Hal?

353
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,960
来，我教你要怎么做
Here, let me show you how to get your hands dirty.

354
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,130
啊? 啊?
Huh? Huh?

355
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,632
噢，不
Oh, no!

356
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,051
好了，这样就应该差不...
There. That ought to take the chill out--

357
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,600
我要把你们俩变成勇者和冷电侠
You two are about to become the brave and the cold.

358
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,813
这工作得需要一些无聊的东西来才能搞定
This jobs calls for something dull and blunt.

359
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,564
嘿
Hey

360
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,483
哈哈哈 - 啊？
Ha-ha-ha. Huh?

361
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,914
你只会用蝙蝠镖吗，蝙蝠侠?
Are Batarangs all you've got, Batman?

362
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:03,127
你要知道，黑蝠鲼，我是练过秘密武术的
You should know, Black Manta, that I'm
trained in the secret skills of martial arts.

363
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:08,757
你的激光和铠甲敌不过这古老的震动掌
Your lasers and armor are no match
for the ancient vibrating palm technique.

364
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,342
投降吧
Surrender now.

365
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,678
我的答案是不，蠢货
Here's your answer, fool.

366
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,123
哦不，我的电量
Oh, no, my battery.

367
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,923
有猫
Cat.

368
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,762
你这蠢猫，我看不见路了
You frustrating feline, I can't see!

369
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,822
毁灭军团，任务完成了，
Legion of Doom, mission accomplished.

370
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,201
让我们胜利撤退吧
Let us make our victorious retreat.

371
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,870
莱秃拿到了什么?
What's Lex got there?

372
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,789
肯定不妙
Nothing good.

373
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,293
哦，不，别跑
Oh, no, you don't.

374
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,132
还想在上一课吗，机器小子
Back for another lesson, Robot Boy?

375
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,802
来个突击测验吧
Here's a pop quiz.

376
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,022
你输了
You failed.

377
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,862
又一次，要由我给猪队友们来收拾烂摊子
Once again, it's up to me to clean up after lesser people's messes.

378
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,044
他们要逃走了
They're getting away.

379
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,005
有我在就没人能偷走政府的财产
Nobody steals government property while I'm around.

380
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,145
超人，你没事吧
Superman, you okay?

381
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,481
那推进器还真是够有劲的
Those afterburners really pack a punch.

382
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,151
反派们合作？
Villains working together?

383
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,486
这只是个时间问题
It was only a matter of time.

384
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,489
但是我们可是教训了他们一顿，
Ah, but we kicked their butts.

385
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,825
来击掌
Up high.

386
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,704
我们得解决一下击掌问题
We gotta work on that.

387
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,581
你们让他们逃走了
You let them get away.

388
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,333
别拿你军队的那套来唬人，将军
Don't get your Army-issued undies in a bunch, admiral.

389
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,963
他们只是拿了一罐子巨型汽水什么的
The only thing they got was a giant can of soda or something.

390
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,048
那是个外星人
It was an alien.

391
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,259
一个来自外太空的危险怪物
A dangerous monster from space.

392
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:02,139
而你们因为自己的无能让他从手指缝中溜走了
And you let it slip through your fingers because of your incompetence.

393
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,600
如果只是无能的话就好了
If it was incompetence.

394
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,312
我怎么知道你们外星人不是一伙的
How do I know all you aliens
aren't in cahoots?

395
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,480
嘿，超人不是外星人
Hey, Superman isn't an alien.

396
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,317
他是...额...好吧我想他的确是
He's a-- Oh, yeah, I guess he kind of is.

397
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,860
等一下，闪电侠
Wait a minute, Flash.

398
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:19,031
真正的问题是，你为什么囚禁外星人?
The real question is, why are you incarcerating aliens?

399
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,075
呃，那个....
Ugh. Well...

400
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,953
我不是该被审讯的人，超人
I'm not the one being questioned here,Superman.

401
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,499
现在如果你不介意，我还有个政府财产要去找
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got government property to locate.

402
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,296
我们政府一定没有在囚禁外星人吧
Surely our government isn't arresting extraterrestrials.

403
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,340
根据我对他行为的分析
Based on my analysis of his behavior...

404
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,843
莱恩将军做的事大大地超出了他的权限
more likely that General Lane is greatly exceeding his authority.

405
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,847
怎么拉长着一张脸，钢骨
Why the long face, Cyborg?

406
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,601
你独自一人对抗了如此强大的对手，干得不错
You held your own against a formidable opponent. Good job.

407
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,770
不错？他们逃走了
Good job? They got away.

408
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,314
如果不是因为我，我们本可以阻止他们的
If it wasn't for me, we could have stopped them.

409
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,359
你还是这个团队里最年轻以及最伟大的成员
You're still the youngest and greenest member of this team.

410
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,777
放轻松
Cut yourself some slack.

411
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,529
别对自己太苛刻了，小子，你做得不错
Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself, kid.You did fine.

412
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:03,033
这是我们头一次面对一整个具有超能力的团队
Look, this is the first time we've met a completely superpowered team.

413
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,536
这太出人意料，肯定会有很多成长的烦恼
It was a total surprise. There were bound to be some growing pains.

414
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:11,959
问题是，我们下次相遇会怎么样？
The question is, what happens next time we meet?

415
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,884
该死的震动掌
Stupid vibrating palm.

416
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,679
被一个废柴军团缠住
Stuck with a Legion of Losers.

417
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,430
是啊，你们都没人支援我的
Yeah, none of you had my back.

418
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,765
我一直是一人
I was all alone.

419
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,268
那也总比跟格鲁德一起困在飞碟里好
Better alone than stuck in a saucer
with Grodd.

420
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,354
这次失败是个耻辱
That was a humiliating defeat.

421
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,856
-干得漂亮，各位. -  啊?
- Excellent work, everyone. - Huh?

422
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,819
你疯了吗，莱克斯，我们好不容易才逃出来已经很幸运了
Are you nuts, Lex? We were lucky to make it out of there in one piece.

423
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,488
对啊，你说我们要毁掉正义联盟
Yeah, you said we'd destroy the Justice League.

424
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,408
你对我们作为一个团队的能力的估计
Your estimate of our effectiveness as a team...

425
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,159
还有很多值得商权，卢瑟
...left much to be desired, Luthor.

426
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,955
听听你们说的
Listen to you all.

427
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:54,751
你们因为在一场公平对抗中没打败正义联盟而失望？
You're disappointed that you didn't beat
the Justice League in a fair fight?

428
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,631
超级恶棍的哪一方面你们没有理解？
What part of supervillain do you not comprehend?

429
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,676
我的科鲁加朋友说的没错
My Korugarian friend is correct.

430
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:07,222
我们突袭52区的目的是给我们弄个秘密武器，
The whole point of our raid on Area 52 was to give us a secret weapon...

431
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,558
让胜利天平倒向我们
to tip the scales in our favor.

432
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,102
一张王牌
A game-changer.

433
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,981
就是它了
Here it is.

434
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,566
Hmm?

435
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,158
冷静下来，我的朋友，你现在安全了
Calm yourself, friend. You're safe now.

436
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,869
我，莱克斯·卢瑟，解放你
I, Lex Luthor, release you.

437
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,672
Yipe!

438
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,134
你看见了我的自由斗士团队是怎么拼死战斗
You saw how my band of freedom fighters battled to rescue you...

439
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,928
把你从那卑鄙的正义联盟手中救出来的...
from the clutches of the dastardly Justice League...

440
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,891
那群我们世界的残酷暴君
the horrible oppressors of our world.

441
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,101
我们都是一伙的
We're all on your side.

442
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,812
是的，别害怕
It's true. Don't be afraid.

443
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,274
我们毁灭军团反抗军解放了你
We rebels in the Legion of Doom freed you.

444
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,489
告诉他们你的名字
Tell them your name.

445
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,701
尚恩·琼兹...
J'onn J'onzz.

446
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,915
我叫尚恩·琼兹，来自你们称为火星的星球
I am J'onn J'onzz of the planet you call Mars.

447
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,584
感谢你拯救了我
Thank you for freeing me.

448
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:22,172
很好，那这小小的太空蜥蜴怎么帮助我们呢
Swell. How is this little space lizard
supposed to help us, Luthor, huh?

449
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,135
给他们看看你的能力，我的朋友
Show them what you can do, my friend.

450
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,987
棒极了
Fantastic.

451
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:51,118
好，那你是否愿意加入我们的正义革命推翻正义联盟的暴政呢
Now, will you join our righteous revolution
against the tyranny of the Justice League?

452
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,456
但是你们这名字，毁灭军团...
But your name, Legion of Doom...

453
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,960
是指的正义联盟的毁灭
As in doom for the Justice League.

454
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,505
一个让他们闻风丧胆的名字
A name to strike fear into their wicked hearts.

455
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,883
-对对，是这个意思 -你说的没错
- Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it meant.
-You are correct. Yes.

456
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,596
那些关押我的人应该受到惩罚
Those who held me captive should be punished.

457
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,268
-太好啦 -说得对
- Outstanding. -All right!

458
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:31,491
据观测：钢骨和正义联盟呆在一起的时间越来越少了...
Observation: Cyborg is spending less time with the Justice League...

459
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,578
而升级正义大厅却花费了越来越多的时间
and more time performing upgrades to the Hall of Justice.

460
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,455
提问：为什么呢
Query: Why?

461
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,212
没用的
It's no use.

462
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,550
我的兴趣爱好都没法让我静下心来，我需要一些建议
Not even my hobby can clear my mind. I need some advice.

463
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,771
救命  
Help.

463
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,971
我这辈子就想当个英雄，
I've wanted to be a hero my whole life...

464
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,807
而加入正义联盟使我美梦成真
and being on the Justice League is a dream come true.

465
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,809
但只是，我感觉...
It's just-- I feel like I'm not--

466
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,021
你「感觉」，就是问题所在
You feel. That's the problem.

467
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,858
你应该将自己的情绪隐藏起来
You need to stuff your emotions deep down inside.

468
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,526
什么也不要感觉
Feel nothing.

469
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:11,907
只需要针对这个充满懦弱迷信罪犯的世界做出计划，然后行动
Only plot, plan and react to a world
full of cowardly, superstitious criminals.

470
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,492
这才是健康的生活方式
It's the healthy thing to do. 

471
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,348
但是我总觉得我跟不上进度
But I feel like I'm just not up to speed.

471
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,648
嗯，我在队伍里可能显得有些不平衡
well，Having me on the team kinds of throws off the average.

472
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,166
但如果你真想跟上节奏
But if you really wanna up your game...

473
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,877
你只需要在不稳定的化学物品包围的时候 然后被雷劈一劈
All you have to do is getting hit by lightning when surrounded by chemicals and...

474
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,796
你干这行很轻松啊
You make it seem so easy.

475
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,257
你知道以前在飞行学校的时候我们说什么吗？
You know what we used to say in flight school?

476
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,635
直到你成功之前，一定要假装你已经成功了
Fake it till you make it.

477
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,182
你只需要探求内心，男人起来...
You just gotta dig deep and man up...

478
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,517
或者机器起来...
or machine up...

479
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,560
或者管他的
or whatever.

480
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,355
看起来无论我做什么都是错的
Seems like whatever I do, it's the wrong call.

481
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,066
你是不是有些小小的忧郁，钢骨?
Are you feeling a teensy bit blue, Cyborg?

482
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,819
给你唱首我们堪萨斯人经常唱的歌吧，非常振奋人心
Here's a little song we used to sing
back in Kansas. Always cheered me up.

483
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,949
噢 一个农夫需要把子 梨和锄头
<i>Oh,</i> a <i>farmer needs</i> a <i>rake
And</i> a <i>plow and</i> a <i>hoe</i>

484
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,701
他还必须精力旺盛 懂得尝试
<i>And lots of pep and some zip
And a tiny pinch of go</i>

485
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,454
穿着他的吊带裤 帽子和鞋子
<i>And get into his overalls
And hat and shoes</i>

486
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,915
如果他一开始就放弃 那早晨工作注定不顺利
<i>If he wants to lose
The early morning blues</i>

487
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,124
哈哈
Ha-ha.

488
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:09,047
然后超人给我唱了首我完全听不懂的歌
And then Superman sang me a song that I did not get at all.

489
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,675
哦，对，我以前也听过那首歌
Oh, yes, I've heard that song before.

490
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,552
我也完全没懂
I didn't get it either.

491
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,389
听着，维克，你回顾最近几场战斗，发现了很多不足
Listen, Vic, you look at your recent battles
and see mistakes.

492
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,224
那是你的看法
That's just your perception...

493
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,601
而不是别人的看法
not necessarily the perception of others...

494
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,854
更不是我对你的看法
and certainly not my perception of you.

495
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,607
你是个年轻的英雄，前途光明
You're a young hero
with a lot going for you.

496
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,818
你只需要相信自己的直觉
You just have to trust your instincts.

497
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,530
给自己时间成长并相信自己
Give yourself time to grow and believe in yourself.

498
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:38,743
所以你是说我应该强化我的机械部件，
So you're saying I should really beef up my cybernetic components

499
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,788
然后我就会更加自信
so I can then trust myself.

500
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,291
正确...等等，什么？不是
Exact-- Wait, what? No.

501
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,876
谢谢，神奇女侠，这就是我将要做的
Thanks, Wonder Woman. That's exactly what I'll do.

502
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,129
现在就开始
Right now.

503
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,970
真不知道我以前怎么没想到，只需要升级装备就好啦
I don't know why I didn't think of it before.Just gotta gear up.

504
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,441
Booyah.

505
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,203
你好啊，蝙蝠侠
What's up, Batman?

506
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,913
Mm.

507
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,291
你过得怎样，哈尔？
How you feeling, Hal?

508
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:31,546
我活在美梦里，维克，而且我的方式比闪电侠更好
I'm living the dream, Vic.
And I'm doing it way better than Flash.

509
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,592
-蝙蝠侠 -祝你今天愉快
- Batman. -Have a nice day.

510
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,390
蝙蝠侠，我知道这听起来很奇怪...
Batman, I know this must sound strange...

511
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,143
但是我觉得我刚刚经过你两次...而且我...
but I think I just passed you twice, and I don't...

512
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,896
也许如果你专注于超级英雄的责任
Perhaps if you concentrated on superheroing

513
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,649
而不是到处管多管闲事
instead of butting into
other people's business

514
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,859
你才会成为一个更好的正义联盟成员
you'd be a better Justice League member.

515
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,404
额...好吧，对不起
Oh, right. Sorry.

516
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,388
这就是我学到的方式，
And that's how I learned

517
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:25,016
千万不要在谷仓里关着灯去给奶牛挤奶
you should never milk a cow in the barn when the lights are off.

518
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,393
嘿，等一下
Hey, wait up.

519
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,395
嘿，蝙蝠侠，刚刚我遇到你的时候
Hey, Batman, maybe that was meant...

520
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,690
也许你可以给点更善意一点的批评...
to be more constructive criticism when I passed you just now--

521
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,234
我遇见你时什么都没说啊
I didn't say anything when you walked by just now.

522
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,903
不，你说了，还叫我别多管闲事
Yes, you did. And you told me to butt out.

523
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,488
这有点无礼
Came off a little rude.

524
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,825
蝙蝠侠永远不会跟你说叫你别多管闲事
Batman would never tell you to put your butt out.

525
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:47,122
他也许是黑暗骑士，但是对我来说，他是个文雅的巡警
He may be the Dark Knight,
but to me, he's the Polite Patrolman.

526
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,377
但那不是官方暱称，我自己想出来的
But that's not an official nickname. I came up with it myself.

527
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:56,589
你的机械眼里一定有双重影像了，让我来帮你
You must be getting a double image in your cybernetic eye. Let me help.

528
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,011
好点了吗？
There. Better?

529
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,890
我们晚一点再继续讨论吧
We'll have to table this little chat until later.

530
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,982
那个核反应堆出事了，这个是政府
It's that nuketron reactor that went online,
the one the government hopes...

531
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,359
能够解决世界能源问题的的希望
will provide a solution to the world's energy needs.

532
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,612
希波吕忒的发网，核反应堆出故障了
By Hippolyta's hairnet, the reactor is malfunctioning.

533
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,531
它快要核心融解了
It's in danger of a total meltdown.

534
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,701
核心融解会威胁到成千上万居民的安全
A core meltdown would endanger thousands of citizens.

535
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,829
-你的命令是什么，蝙蝠侠 - 出发
- What are your orders, Batman?
-Let's go.

536
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,466
它在那爆着呢
There she blows.

537
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,718
懂吗，因为它快爆炸了
Get it? Because it's gonna blow up.

538
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,889
现在不是说笑话的时候，绿灯侠，钢骨，能源核心还有多久融解
Not now, Green Lantern. Cyborg, how long
before the energy core melts down?

539
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,147
真奇怪，我的指示器显示一切正常
This is strange. My readouts don't detect anything wrong.

540
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,690
一切看起来很正常
Everything looks normal.

541
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,485
该去加点机油了吧，铁皮人，你自己看看那东西
Time for an oil change, Tin Man? Look at that thing.

542
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,946
那就跟蝙蝠侠笑一样「正常」
That's about as normal
as Batman smiling.

543
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,046
你的指示是什么，无畏的领袖？
What are your orders, fearless leader?

544
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,215
钢骨和我警戒边线
Cyborg and I will secure the perimeter.

545
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,885
闪电侠，你和神奇女侠把工作人员从里面救出来
Flash, you and Wonder Woman
get the power plant crew out of that inferno.

546
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,429
超人和哈尔，你们对核辐射免疫，
Superman and Hal,
you're both immune to radiation.

547
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,932
去阻止能源核心融解
Stop the energy core from melting down...

548
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,770
要不然大都会接下来一万年都将是个荒无人烟的核辐射地带
or else Metropolis becomes a lifeless radiation hot zone for the next 10,000 years.

549
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,731
额...这算是鼓舞士气的话?
Ugh. That's a pep talk?

550
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,567
记得提醒我永远不要参加你的励志讲座
Remind me to never attend your motivational seminars.

551
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,778
上吧，伙计们
Let's do this, guys.

552
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,907
别担心，伙计们，我分分钟把你们救出去
Don't worry, fellas, I'll have you out of danger in a flash.

553
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,116
Ooh.

554
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,326
Huh?

555
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,625
卡桑德拉的胸衣，你们没看见你们处于危险之中吗？
Cassandra's corset, can't you see the danger you're in?

556
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,836
Huh?

557
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,129
嘿，我的三明治
Hey, my sandwich.

558
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,052
蝙蝠侠，我的读数还是一切正常
Batman,I'm still reading everything is normal.

559
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,097
你的软件问题我们回去再解决
We'll deal with your software glitches when we get back.

560
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,057
超人，哈尔，你们看见了什么?
Superman, Hal, what do you see?

561
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,854
供水系统和反应堆之间的冷却液泵已经毁了
The coolant pump between the water supply and reactor core is toast.

562
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,940
难怪过热了，我来解决
No wonder it's overheating. I'm on it.

563
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,915
来自核反应堆内部的报道
Reporting from inside the nuketron reactor.

564
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,751
看来核反应堆随时都会爆炸
It looks as though this reactor will blow at any moment.

565
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,088
造成史上最大的人为灾祸
Making this the greatest man-made catastrophe of all time.

566
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,967
我这该能得普利策奖了吧
I'd better get a Pulitzer for this.

567
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,137
是露易斯，她在核反应堆里
It's Lois. She's in the reactor.

568
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,224
超人，救命
Superman, help!

569
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,146
坚持住，露易斯
There you go, Lois.

570
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,356
我马上把你救出去...
Now let's get you out of here before--

571
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,150
露易斯？
Lois?

572
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,492
哈尔
Hal.

573
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,037
你的冷却液泵不起作用
Your coolant pump isn't working.

574
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,289
那你来压啊 
Then you come pump it.

575
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,629
蝙蝠侠，核心里的温度比太阳还高
Batman, the core temperature is hotter than the sun.

576
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,548
核心快要全面熔毁了，我们只有几分钟时间
We're in full meltdown. We have only about a minute

577
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,135
来阻止核心把大都会夷为平地了
to stop the core from burning and irradiating Metropolis.

578
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,388
-我的感应器依旧... -把核心控制到安全温度，
- My sensors aren't--
-Cool the core to a safer temperature...

579
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,724
一直撑到把它搬出大楼
long enough to get it out of the building.

580
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,726
我尽量
I'll do my best.

581
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,527
哈尔，去帮超人把核心搬出去
Hal, help Superman get that core out of there.

582
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,988
已经开始了，蝙蝠
Already on it, Bats.

583
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,473
有些不对劲啊
someting's not right here.

584
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,896
抓稳了
Hold steady.

585
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,940
准备
Get ready.

586
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,151
走你
Here we go.

587
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,415
拯救世界
Saved the day.

588
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,250
又一次
Again.

589
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,920
嘿，你懂我了，哈哈哈
Hey, you got it. Ha-ha-ha.

590
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,432
一号摄像机
Camera one.

591
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,183
二号摄像机
Camera two.

592
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,644
一号摄像机
Camera one.

593
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,479
二号摄像机
Camera two.

594
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,898
钢骨呼叫蝙蝠侠，发现些有些奇怪的情况
Cyborg to Batman, something's funny here.

595
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,943
我是说「出事了」的意思，不是「哈哈哈」的意思
And I mean funny "messed up," not funny "ha-ha-ha."

596
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,904
看来反应堆根本没出问题
<i>There was never anything wrong with the reactor.</i>

597
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,367
我开始觉得你是对的了
I'm beginning to think you're right.

598
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,911
核反应堆完全毁了
Aw, the nuketron reactor is finished.

599
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,289
你们为什么要毁掉我们的能源站
Why did you destroy our power plant?

600
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,125
你们怎么了，瞎吗？——咳咳
- What are you, blind? -Ahem.

601
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,545
我的同事是想说，你们可能没注意到...
What my colleague means to say is that you may not have noticed...

602
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:32,258
你们的新能源站刚刚险些熔毁？
...your new power plant was experiencing a meltdown?

603
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,386
你看，现在看起来确实不像有熔毁的情况发生
You know, now it does look a little less melty.

604
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,639
唯一的损坏是我们自己造成的
The only damage is the damage we inflicted ourselves.

605
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,435
超人，你和你的联盟刚刚毁掉了价值数十亿的能源设施...
Superman，You and the league have just destroyed
a multibillion-dollar power plant...

606
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,938
而这本来可以使大都会在能源供应问题上领先世界
that could've made Metropolis a world leader in energy production.

607
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,567
-你们还有什么可说的 -露易斯，你没事
- What do you have to say for yourselves?
-Lois, you're okay.

608
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,988
没事？我气坏了，大家也一样，你对那些说正义联盟
Okay? I'm livid, like everyone else on Earth. 
What do you say to your critics...

609
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,492
权力太大的批评家有什么想说的
who claim the Justice League has too much power and no oversight?

610
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,788
-哇哦哇哦，什么批评家 -我爸爸就是一个
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What critics?
-My daddy, for one.

611
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,207
-他是你爸爸？ -谁是你爸爸？
- He's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy?

612
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,167
我知道他是你爸爸
I knew he was your daddy.

613
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,754
根本没有什么什么融解，反应堆工作正常
There was no meltdown. The reactor was working fine.

614
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,422
你们看见了吗，
Do you see, people?

615
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,842
我们让这群超能团队无拘无束
We let super-powered goons run around unrestricted...

616
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,720
而这就是必然发生的结果
and this is the type of thing that is bound to happen.

617
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,973
我是说，看看那个机器人的武器
I mean, just look at all the weapons on the robot one.

618
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,809
他们随时可能擦枪走火
They could go off at any moment.

619
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,227
武器是邪恶的
- Boo! - Weapons are evil!

620
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,020
我讨厌枪
I don't like guns!

621
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:30,650
所谓的正义联盟需要为他们的罪行付出代价
The so-called Justice League needs to pay for its crimes.

622
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:34,028
在发生更糟糕的情况之前他们必须受到控制
They must be controlled before something worse takes place.

623
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,031
我们中计了，
We've been had.

624
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,283
根本没有核心融解
There was no meltdown.

625
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,044
大家大家，不要慌乱
People, people, don't panic.

626
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,964
这肯定有什么天大的误会
This has apparently been one big misunderstanding.

627
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,383
我忍不住插嘴了 希望你不要介意
I just jumped in there. I hope you don't mind.

628
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,303
人们比较喜欢你 就由你来说吧
You're the people person. I'll let you run with this.

629
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,014
正义联盟是负责任的
The Justice League is all about responsibility.

630
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,517
我确信一旦我们把一切解释清楚...
I'm sure that once we've explained everything...

631
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,811
世界法庭会很乐意的宣告我们...
the world court will happily find us--

632
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,606
-罪名成立 -啥？！
- Guilty as charged. -What?

633
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,317
在大都会投放臭气弹，
For the charges of stink bombing Metropolis...

634
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,778
进攻绝密的政府设施，
attacking a top secret government facility...

635
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:20,158
还有荒唐的破坏，差点造成核炉心熔毁
and wanton destruction nearly causing a nuclear meltdown...

636
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:24,328
正义联盟将被驱逐出地球
the Justice League is banished from the planet Earth.

637
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,455
立即生效
Effective immediately.

638
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,085
正义联盟垮台
Down with the Justice League!

639
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,629
我以前喜欢他们，现在不了
I used to like them, but now I don't.

640
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,383
叫这个蓝大个替我们说话真是好主意啊
Nice call letting the big blue Boy Scout speak for us.

641
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,261
这就是为啥我投票给神奇女侠
And that's why I voted for Wonder Woman.

642
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,848
好了，这个阴谋到此为止了
All right, this conspiracy has gone far enough.

643
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,894
我们必须弄个水落石出，我们藏入黑暗，低调行动
We have to get to the bottom of it.
We're going dark. Off the grid.

644
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,481
我们在阴影中解决这个谜团，准备好跟随我的领导然后
We'll work from the shadows to solve this mystery. Get ready to follow my lead and--

645
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,484
-不 -你在干什么?
- Nope. -What are you doing?

646
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,445
我是正义联盟的领导
I'm the leader of the Justice League.

647
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,406
是你坚持要选我做领导的
You've made a point of following my orders.

648
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:04,911
这次不行，组建正义联盟就是为了为世界人民服务
Not this time. The Justice League was
formed to serve the people of the world.

649
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,371
他们否决了你的权力，蝙蝠侠
They overrule your authority, Batman.

650
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,582
如果他们想要我们走，我们就走
If they want us gone, we go.

651
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,959
说得好，外星人
Nice speech, alien.

652
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,296
警卫，把这些英雄赶出我的视线
Guards, get these heroes out of my sight.

653
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:33,397
就这样世界告别了正义联盟，总算摆脱了他们
<i>And so the world says goodbye and good riddance to the Justice League.</i>

654
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,781
太好了
Yes. All right.

655
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,576
来击掌
High five. Heh.

656
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,426
现在擦掉眼泪，钢骨，银河可是很大的
Now, wipe away those tears, Cyborg. It's a big galaxy.

657
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,762
跟着我让我们尽情狂欢
Stick with me and we'll have a blast.

658
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,556
你知道吗，我知道一颗有坏掉的烤面包机居住的星球
You know, I know a planet inhabited by broken toasters.

659
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,935
说不定我们还可以给你找个女朋友
Maybe we can find you a girlfriend.

660
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,399
我觉得你可以放开蝙蝠侠了 ——嗯?
- I think you can let go of Batman now. -Hmm?

661
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,068
哦，对不起啊，蝙蝠侠
Oh. Heh. Sorry about that, Batman.

662
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,653
但是法律就是法律
But the law is the law.

663
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,949
我们等会再来谈谈你的小叛乱
We'll discuss your little mutiny later.
Our job now is to gather evidence...

664
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,493
现在我们的任务是搜集证据证明我们是被陷害的，然后重返地球
prove we were framed and then return to Earth.

665
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,581
恐怕重返地球是不可能了
I'm afraid returning to Earth is not an option.

666
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,917
塞尼斯托，我速速去把他搞定了
Sinestro. I'll make quick work of him.

667
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,712
你这叫快？要是我早就结束了
You call this quick? I'd be totally done by now.

668
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,172
对吧
Right?

669
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,051
我只是来给你们个小小的离别礼物
I just came to give you a little farewell gift.

670
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,804
希望你还留着礼物的发票，塞尼斯托
I hope you kept the gift receipt, Sinestro.

671
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,439
保持射击，他必须得维持那面护盾就没法攻击我们了
Keep firing. He'll have to keep up that shield and won't be able to attack.

672
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,107
想当然
Think so?

673
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,318
来见见我的新朋友
Meet my new best friend.

674
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,238
他被称为父盒
It's called a Father Box.

675
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,871
这不会让你们大吃一惊吗？
Doesn't this just bowl you over?

676
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,417
准备被冲到银河系另一头吧
Prepare to be flushed to the other side of the galaxy.

677
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,177
我懂啦，冲...
Oh, I get it. Bowl. Flush.

678
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,972
就像冲厕所一样
Like a toilet!

679
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,900
然后我说：
And then I said:

680
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:45,821
「准备被冲到银河系另一头吧」
"Prepare to be flushed to the other side of the galaxy."

681
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,995
我打赌闪电侠肯定没听懂
I bet Flash didn't get it.

682
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,633
恭喜我们
Congratulations to us all.

683
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,927
毁灭军团胜利了
The Legion of Doom is victorious.

684
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,013
胜利者的奖励是...
And to the victors go the spoils.

685
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:16,936
地球是我们的啦
- The Earth is ours.
- Yeah!

686
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,312
Yes!

687
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,066
就像之前讨论的那样，我们要瓜分战利品
As discussed earlier, we will be dividing up the loot.

688
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,570
战利品当然指的是地球上所有的东西
In this case, that means everything on Earth.

689
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,198
我要所有黄色的东西
I claim everything yellow.

690
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,867
没门，香蕉是黄色的
No way. Bananas are yellow.

691
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,495
这个，你可以要绿香蕉嘛
Well, you can have the green bananas.

692
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,123
黄金不也是黄的吗，这不公平你知道吧
Is gold yellow? Because, you know, that's not fair.

693
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,125
你不能直接要所有黄色的东西
You can't just call all yellow.

694
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,295
那我要红色，世上所有红色的东西都是我的
I call red. Everything red is mine.

695
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,007
红宝石，唇膏，苹果
Rubies, lipstick, apples.

696
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,802
大海是蓝色的
The ocean's blue.

697
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,514
塞尼斯托 - 海里所有的东西都是我的 - 作为冲走正义联盟的奖励
Sinestro - Everything in the ocean is mine.
as a bonus for flushing the Justice League 

698
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,891
为什么不给自己一些奖励
why don't you treat yourself?

699
00:48:56,058 --> 00:49:00,104
去摧毁正义大厅，这样当征服开始时
Go destroy their Hall of Justice,
so when the conquest begins...

700
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,149
人们就会知道他们已经无人可以求助了
people will know they have no one to turn to.

701
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,152
哈哈，不介意的话我就去做了
Heh-heh. Don't mind if I do.

702
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:12,616
莱克斯，所有关于这些征服
Lex, all this talk of conquest...

703
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,745
像战利品一样瓜分世界的这些对话
...of dividing this planet like the spoils of war...

704
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,541
我们难道不是带来自由的解放者吗
are we not liberators bringing freedom?

705
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,961
是啊，是啊，当然，尚恩，我们正在解放他们
Yes. Yes. Of course, J'onn. We are freeing them.

706
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,464
我们让他们从自由做决定中解放出来
We're freeing them of making their own decisions.

707
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,301
不要用你那能心灵感应的绿脑袋担心了，相信我
Don't you worry your telepathic green head about it. Trust me.

708
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,636
我会的
I Will.

709
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,972
暂时
For now.

710
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,104
火星人有什么问题吗
Problems with the Martian?

711
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,814
他快发现了
He's catching on.

712
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,109
不过幸运的是，他已经失去利用价值了
Fortunately, he's already served his purpose.

713
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:50,112
什么时候有空就把他干掉
Feel free to eliminate him permanently.

714
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,824
哦，披萨到了
Oh, the pizza's here.

715
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,224
我们快被吸进黑洞了，抓紧
We're caught in the gravity pull of that black hole. Hang tight.

716
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,850
抓着呢
Hanging.

717
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,611
加油，宝贝，你能行的
Come on, baby. You got this.

718
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:49,046
呃，我已经把我所有意念都给了她，但是我还是逃不开引力
Ugh. I'm giving her all the willpower I've got,
but I just can't escape its gravity.

719
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,924
-你们在后面还好吗? - 还好
- You guys all right back there? - All right.

720
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,721
嗷
Ow.

721
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,807
哦，可怜的朋友
Oh, poor friend.

722
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:04,019
我应该给你唱一首歌颂阵亡英雄的弥斯库拉之歌给你
I shall sing the Themysciran song of dead heroes for you.

723
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,695
不用唱歌，神奇女侠
No need to sing, Wonder Woman.

724
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,029
他是个假人
He's just a dummy.

725
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,448
那又怎样，他是我们的朋友
That doesn't matter. He was our friend.

726
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,909
不，那是电子机器人
No, that was Cy-bot. Huh.

727
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,537
难怪我们起飞后他就表现的怪怪的
No wonder he was acting weird ever since takeoff.

728
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,914
那么两个问题来了
Which leaves us with two questions:

729
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,333
我们怎么逃离这里
How do we get out of this jam

730
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,461
还有真正的钢骨在哪里
and where is the real Cyborg?

731
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,757
我不想就这么抛下伙计们的
I hate to leave the guys in a lurch...

732
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,176
但是我知道事有些不对劲
...but I know there was something fishy going on.

733
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,637
这肯定有什么线索，但是在哪呢
There must be some clue here, but where?

734
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,973
在哪？在哪？
Where? Where?

735
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,601
哈，一条线索
Ah! A clue.

736
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,186
某种奇怪的外星科技
Some kind of weird alien tech.

737
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,982
这怎么会在这？最好看看监控录像
How'd this get here? Better check the security tapes.

738
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,821
<i>Huh?</i>

739
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,286
噢，我记得你
Oh, I know you.

740
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,289
啊哈，那就是我在人群中看到的
Aha! That's the thing I saw.

741
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,917
我就知道它不可能是随便一个穿着红内裤的绿色家伙
I knew it couldn't have been some random green guy in red underwear.

742
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,880
现在需要我做的就是带着证据离开并且证明正义联盟的清白
All I have to do is get this evidence out there and clear the Justice League.

743
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,799
向谁去证明？
Clear them with who?

744
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,846
还有几个小时，毁灭军团就会统治世界了
Within a few hours, the Legion of Doom will have taken over the world.

745
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,182
我真是伤心
How sad for me.

746
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,101
正义联盟剩下的唯一成员...
Only one member of the Justice League left...

747
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,312
是最弱的一个
and it's the weakest one.

748
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:36,904
我觉得你已经知道结局了对吧，半人类
I think you already know how this ends,
don't you, half-man?

749
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,491
你没打中
You missed.

750
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,338
得赶快走，这证据比我去报仇重要多了
Gotta keep moving. This evidence is more important than me getting payback.

751
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,935
Whoa!

752
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,688
嘿，那是神奇女侠的隐形飞机
Hey, that was Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet.

753
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,192
哦，当她发现你干了什么好事，你就有大麻烦了
Oh, when she finds out what you did,
you are gonna be in so much trouble.

754
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,611
她永远也不会发现
She'll never find out...

755
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,988
正义联盟剩下的人也是
nor will the rest of the Justice League...

756
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,409
因为我把他们冲到宇宙对面去了
because I flushed them all to the opposite side of the universe.

757
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,914
我说是「冲」，因为我弄了个虫洞知道吗
I say flushed because I created this Wormhole, you see...

758
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,417
然后它相当于...
and it resembled a--

759
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,961
你当时要是在就好啦
You just had to be there.

760
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,881
尽管逃吧，
Go ahead, run.

761
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:42,511
这只会让你最终的失败更令人愉悦
It'll make your final defeat all the more enjoyable.

762
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,519
要活着，要找到办法阻止军团
Gotta stay alive. Gotta find a way to stop the legion.

763
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,821
什么，正义联盟？
What? The Justice League?

764
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,322
还活着？
Alive?

765
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,367
哈？他说什么
What? What's he talking about?

766
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,660
不可能
Impossible.

767
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,037
不是不可能
Not impossible.

768
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,373
对我来说
- For me. -Ah!

769
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:15,294
你已经被我精神控制了，塞尼斯托
You are under my mental control,Sinestro.

770
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:20,841
唯一自由的方式就是照我说的做
The only way to be set free is to do what I ask.

771
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,595
你就是那个陷害我们的变形人，对吧，你对他做了什么
You're the shape-shifter who set us up,
aren't you? What'd you do to him?

772
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:29,808
像我这样的火星人，拥有影响心智的能力
Martians, like me, have the ability to influence minds.

773
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,186
有机物的心智
Organic minds.

774
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,646
但你不一样，钢骨
Unlike yours, Cyborg.

775
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,691
哦，能源站，
Oh, the power plant.

776
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,444
其他人都看见能源站出故障了
<i>Everyone else saw the plant malfunctioning...</i>

777
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,279
是因为你让他们看见的
<i>because you were making them see that.</i>

778
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,908
但是我的电子有机大脑对你的能力免疫
<i>But my cyber-organic brain is immune to your powers.</i>

779
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,827
我还是不相信你
I still don't trust you.

780
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,496
请停下
Please. Stop.

781
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,206
我是来帮忙的
I am here to help.

782
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,125
就像你「帮忙」让正义联盟被驱逐
Pfft. Like you helped the Justice League get banished?

783
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,462
现在整个世界已经是毁灭军团唾手可得的自助餐了
The world is an all-you-can-conquer buffet for the Legion of Doom.

784
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,715
我被骗了
I was tricked.

785
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,635
莱克斯·卢瑟把我从52区放了出来
Lex Luthor freed me from Area 52.

786
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,805
我以为他是个解放者
I thought he was a liberator.

787
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,559
我的判断力被复仇的阴云所蒙蔽
I let my thirst for vengeance cloud my judgment.

788
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,479
拜托你，让我来纠正所犯下的错误
Please, let me make this right.

789
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,397
我想帮助你
I want to help you.

790
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:22,778
-怎么帮 -我有一些想法
- How? -I have some thoughts.

791
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:31,203
最后，瓦努阿图，越南，委内瑞拉，维京群岛
Finally. Vanuatu, Vietnam, Venezuela, Virgin Islands...

792
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:37,042
也门，赞比亚还有津巴布韦是寒冷队长的
Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe will go to Captain Cold.

793
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,712
等等，什么，为什么我得到的是字母表最后面的
Wait, what? Why do I have to get the end of the alphabet?

794
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,675
格鲁德，你这迂腐的灵长类动物，你让整个军团都无聊得睡着了
Grodd, you pedantic primate.
You've bored the Legion of Doom to sleep.

795
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,051
够了
Enough of this.

796
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,929
征服地球，开始
Let the conquest of the Earth begin.

797
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:19,334
-哇哦，看看这些 -不错的科技
- Wow, look at all of this.
-lmpressive technology.

798
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:29,303
好了，塞尼斯托，该把正义联盟冲回来了
All right, Sinestro, time to un-flush the Justice League.

799
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,098
哈哈哈，冲，我喜欢这个
Heh-heh-heh. Flush. That's a good one.

800
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,321
起作用了，继续加油
Unh. It's working. Keep pouring it on.

801
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:51,658
标枪号可是采用了最先进技术的飞行器，
The Javelin is a state-of-the-art spacecraft.

802
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,787

从没想过有一天我们得到外面推它
Never thought we'd have to get out and push.

803
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,709
雅典娜倒塌的拱门的，我们回家的路
Athena's fallen arches, our way home.

804
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,003
大家一起推啊
Everyone, heave.

805
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,191
Yeah!

807
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,741
Mm.

808
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,669
你召唤我
You summoned me?

809
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,755
毫无疑问是想好好称赞一下
No doubt to heap praise upon my brilliant execution...

810
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,924
我绝妙的计划毁掉了正义联盟吧
of our plan to end the Justice League?

811
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,052
不要忘了你的地位，人类
Remember your place, human.

812
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:56,348
你还没完成你的任务
You haven't completed your end of the agreement yet.

813
00:57:56,515 --> 00:58:02,187
为了确保我们的胜利，我带了几个新礼物
To ensure our victory, I have provided a few more gifts.

814
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,106
Huh?

815
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,863
谁会想到莱克斯会藏有机器猴呢
Who knew Lex had robo-monkeys up his sleeve?

816
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,032
好好表现一下吧
Color me impressed.

817
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,368
前进，我的军团
Forward, my legions.

818
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,954
这城市很快就是我们的了
The city will soon be ours.

819
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:23,417
大都会的下场也就是整个世界的下场
And as goes Metropolis, so goes the world.

820
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,380
统治世界就是好，
<i>We lead the world and there's no doubt</i>

821
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,757
没有事就玩和闹
<i>When there's no work We play and shout</i>

822
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,970
你们好，前任世界统治者
<i>Hello, former rulers of the world.</i>

823
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,389
我是莱克斯·卢瑟
It's Lex Luthor.

824
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,224
是卢梭还是卢瑟
Is it Luther or Luthor?

825
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:43,562
我，莱克斯·卢瑟，本世代最伟大的罪犯，
<i>I, Lex Luthor,the greatest criminal mind of our time...</i>

826
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,314
毁灭军团的统治者
<i>and the leaderof the nefarious Legion of Doom...</i>

827
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,735
要求世界政府立即投降
<i>declare the immediate surrender of the world's governments.</i>

828
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,737
如果你们拒绝
<i>If you refuse...</i>

829
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:57,451
那大都会就是你们的下场
<i>well, let's just say Metropolis is about to be a cautionary tale.</i>

830
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,797
好，计划是这样的
Okay, here's the plan.

831
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,842
哈尔，你，闪电侠和神奇女侠拿下毁灭大厅
Hal, you, Flash and Wonder Woman take out the Hall of Doom.

832
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,928
超人和我会阻止格鲁德的地面军队
Superman and I will stop Grodd and the forces on the ground.

833
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,557
-那我干什么 -我需要你待在这里，钢骨
- What about me?
-I need you to stay in the hall, Cyborg.

834
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,561
守住这里，同时盯着这个火星人
Hold down the fort. And also keep an eye on this Martian.

835
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,566
我告诉过你，蝙蝠侠，我不是一个威胁
I told you, Batman, I am not a threat.

836
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,068
你当然这么说
So you say.

837
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:35,614
但是你确实伪装我们，陷害我们，让我们被驱逐出地球
But you did impersonate us, frame us,
and cause our banishment from Earth.

838
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,950
是的，但除了这些
Yes, but other than that...

839
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,911
蝙蝠侠，我想跟你一起去
Batman, I wanna go with you.

840
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:45,791
钢骨，你单独战斗，就像我原本想做的
Cyborg, by going rogue,like I wanted to...

841
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,292
你救了我们大家
you saved us all.

842
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,505
但是现在，我需要你确保塞尼斯托和火星人呆在这
But right now, I need you to make sure
Sinestro and the Martian stay put.

843
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,131
你能做到吗，士兵？
Can you do that, soldier?

844
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,260
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

845
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,356
胜利是我们的
Victory is ours!

846
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,775
-不尽然 -什么
- Not quite. - What?

847
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,655
别担心，格鲁德
Don't worry, Grodd.

848
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:20,450
你可以在黑门监狱吃香蕉吃个够
You can have all the bananas you want in Blackgate Prison.

849
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,577
干掉他
Destroy him.

850
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:40,595
哈哈，你们绝对不会想到我设计了这个蝙蝠-猩猩战斗装甲
Ha-ha. Little did you suspect that I designed the Bat-gorilla battle suit...

851
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,181
就是为了这种时候准备的
for just such an occasion.

852
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,062
Ah. Ha-ha-ha.

853
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,235
背后偷袭
Shooting a man in the back?

854
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,155
我以为你不会这么低级，格鲁德
I thought you were more evolved than that,Grodd.

855
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,698
Huh?

856
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,749
卢瑟，我们有伴了
Luthor, we have company.

857
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,921
啊，正义联盟，我以为我们干掉他们了
Ah! The Justice League.I thought we ended them.

858
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,341
为什么他们就不能别回来呢
Why won't they just stay ended?

859
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,137
让我给你表演一下该怎么做
Let me show you how it's done.

860
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,556
那我得脑袋后面长眼睛才行
I'd have to have eyes in the back of my head...

861
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,225
因为我会领先你一大截
since I'll be way ahead of you.

862
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,908
我打算叫这个网胜
I'll consider this a net victory.

863
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:54,419
享受冷板凳时光吧，闪电侠
Enjoy your time on the bench, Flash.

864
01:01:56,671 --> 01:02:00,050
看看真正的玩家怎么得分
Watch a real player score some points.

865
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,260
所以你喜欢玩游戏，哈?
So you like to play games, huh?

866
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,846
游戏开始
Game on.

867
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,098
15，30，40
Fifteen. Thirty. Forty.

868
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,392
我今天热血沸腾
I'm on fire today.

869
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,020
那我给你来个冰袋冷静冷静
Let me cool you off with an ice pack.

870
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,901
哈？啊！
Huh? Aah!

871
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:24,115
嘿嘿，看来你该先热热身的，0分
Heh-heh. Looks like you should've warmed up. Zero points.

872
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,244
闪电侠逃脱，10分
Flash escaping，Ten points.

873
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,496
不不不，我得了40
No, no, no, I had 40.

874
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,999
加上从冰里逃出来，还有额外的15分
Plus escape from ice,so that's an extra 15.

875
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,463
给你一个惊喜，神奇女侠
I've got a little surprise for you, Wonder Woman.

876
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:46,888
那不算什么，这才是惊喜
Uh, that wasn't the surprise.This is the surprise.

877
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,022
我们惊喜用完了，怎么阻止她
We're out of surprises.How do we stop her?

878
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,859
只需利用她的一个缺点：她的同情心
By exploiting her one weakness: her compassion.

879
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,456
没打中，卢瑟
<i>You missed, Lex.</i>

880
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,958
是吗
Did I?

881
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,771
不，动物医院
No. The animal hospital.

882
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,189
哦，我们该逃了
Oh, we should run.

883
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,151
我也想啊，但我吓得动不了了
I would, but I'm frozen with fear.

884
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,701
500分
Five hundred points.

885
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,329
600分
Six hundred points.

886
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:59,002
你比一桶猴子还无趣
You're less fun than a barrel of monkeys.

887
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,924
到底还有多少，还...
How many of these are there, any...

888
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,763
不，氪石
No. Kryptonite.

889
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,852
坚持住，超人，我来了
Hold on, Superman. I'm coming.

890
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,161
毁灭大厅是专门设计出来
The Hall of Doom was specifically designed...

891
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:37,457
利用你们的弱点和抵御你们的能力
to withstand your powers and exploit your weaknesses.

892
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:43,922
打败整个正义联盟只是个时间问题
It is only a matter of time before it defeats the entire Justice League.

893
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:47,926
不是整个联盟，我的绿色朋友，我有个主意
Not the entire league, my green friend.I have an idea.

894
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:58,019
正义大厅怎么了
What's happening to the Hall of Justice?

895
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,772
我给它升级了，这是我的兴趣爱好
I gave it an upgrade. It's my hobby.

896
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,781
3，2，1
Three, two, one.

897
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,282
站稳了
Hold on.

898
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,531
Yoo-hoo!

899
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,158
有人在吗
<i>anybody home?</i>

900
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,493
什么？快把这个关了
What? Stop this transmission.

901
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,995
它从哪冒出来的
Where is it coming from?

902
01:05:57,162 --> 01:06:00,582
卢瑟，侦测到一个大家伙朝我们飞来
Luthor, I'm picking up something big flying towards us.

903
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,083
大屏幕
On the screen.

904
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:07,297
不，这不可能
No. It can't be.

905
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,270
快看，是鸟
Look, it's a giant bird.

906
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,147
不，是飞机
No, it's a plane.

907
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,649
额，反正肯定不是超人
Well, it certainly isn't Superman.

908
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,860
他看上去在打盹
He seems to be taking a nap.

909
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:31,196
我也想打个盹
I could use a nap.

910
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,866
钢骨
Cyborg.

911
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,373
现在让他们看看我们的本事
Now let's show them what we got.

912
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,501
而且我们很有范儿
And we got style.

913
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,008
发射迪斯科导弹
Launch disco missiles.

914
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,692
快放开我们正式选举的领袖，格鲁德
Unhand our duly elected leader, Grodd.

915
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,694
哈?
Huh?

916
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,286
很高兴在我有难时有你做我的坚强后盾，超人
Good to know you have my back when it counts, Superman.

917
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,914
看来是钢骨是我们所有人的后盾
Looks like Cyborg had all our backs.

918
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:26,209
有朝一日，他会成为一个伟大的领袖
He'll make a great leader someday.

919
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,253
上吧
Let's go.

920
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,592
能射什么就赶快射出去，开火
Shoot everything we've got at them. Fire.

921
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,224
星星护盾，开启
Star shield, activate.

922
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:55,154
我把这个称为糊你熊脸终结技
I call this my in-your-face finale.

923
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,783
Booyah! Booyah!

924
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,881
走了
Come on.

925
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,730
我先到宠物医院的，900分
I got to the pet hospital first.Nine hundred points.

926
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,065
哇哦，神奇女侠，这看起来挺重的
Wow, Wonder Woman,that looks pretty heavy.

927
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,317
对你来说
Even for you.

928
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,906
用你的热视线焊接大楼的裂缝
Use your heat vision to seal the cracks in the building.

929
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,742
好主意
Great idea.

930
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,585
别担心，鸟儿们都安全了
Don't worry, the birds are safe.

931
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,378
那算1000分
That's a thousand points.

932
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,672
鸟？哈，我救的可是猫
Birds? Ha! I've saved cats.

933
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,215
这可值5000分
That's 5000 points.

934
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,719
你在逗我吗？狗，我救了狗
Are you kidding me? Dogs. I've saved dogs.

935
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,304
一百万分
One million points.

936
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,807
这荒唐的我比你强的游戏简直够了
This ridiculous one-upsmanship has gone on long enough.

937
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,435
我们帮助别人，是因为这是正确的事
We help people because it's the right thing to do.

938
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,938
真正的英雄从不计分
True heroes do not keep score.

939
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,442
呃，她是对的，你知道的 - 是啊
Ugh. She's right, you know. - Yeah.

940
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,488
但是现在不计分我的本事也比你强
But I'm totally better at not keeping score than you.

941
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,697
不可能
Nuh-uh.

942
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,496
哦，不，想都别想
Oh, no, you don't.

943
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,254
你们别想逃
You aren't going anywhere.

944
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,175
拜托，请交给我
Please, leave this to me.

945
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,269
Yipe!

946
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,865
太酷了
That was so cool.

947
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,159
看来你总是能拿下敌人
Looks like you always get your man.

948
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,204
就像...火星猎人一样
Like you're some kind of Martian manhunter.

949
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:13,000
嗯，这名字不错
Hmm. I like it.

950
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,586
最后一个猎物
One last hunt.

951
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,589
但，但，但是我解放了你
But-- But-- But I freed you.

952
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,926
如果不是我，你现在还被关着呢
If it wasn't for me,you'd still be held prisoner.

953
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:27,348
这一点我的确很感激
For that, I am grateful.

954
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:30,476
所以你会放我走
So you'll let me go?

955
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:37,400
是的，但我不保证他们也会
Yes, but I'm afraid they may not.

956
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:50,371
耶，正义联盟
Yay, Justice League!

957
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:54,751
- 驱逐你们不好意思啊，是我们的错 -太好了
- Sorry we exiled you guys. Our bad.- All right!

958
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,043
好，就这样了
Well, that's that.

959
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,964
我想毁灭军团很长一段时间都不能兴风作浪了
Guess it'll be quite a while before
the Legion of Doom can make any trouble.

960
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,549
对，说的不错
Yes, that's true.

961
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,051
多亏了你，钢骨
Thanks to you, Cyborg.

962
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,846
我们都活了下来，地球也脱离了危险
We're all alive,and the Earth is out of danger...

963
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:10,308
因为你相信了自己的直觉
because you trusted your instincts.

964
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,101
干得不错
Good job.

965
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:29,076
至于你，我为这颗星球对待你的方式感到十分抱歉
As for you, I couldn't be more sorry for the way 
this planet treated you when you arrived.

967
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:33,414
但有时我们对还没有见过的事物保持怀疑
But sometimes we're a bit suspicious of things we haven't seen before.

968
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:37,168
我们无畏的领袖曾经也是这么对我的
Our fearless leader used to think the same of me.

969
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,505
请理解，这毕竟是少数人
Please know that was just one narrow individual.

970
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,007
地球人是很热情的
The people of Earth can be very welcoming.

971
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:48,095
根据联盟规定，我还能当37秒钟的领导
According to the bylaws of the league,
I'm only leader for another 37 seconds.

972
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,640
然后又会重新选举
Then it'll be time for another election.

973
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,309
我还是会投你，蝙蝠
You've still got my vote, Bats.

974
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:58,105
我作为领导的最后一个决定，是为我们的新同伴提供
My final act as leader is to offer a Justice League membership...

975
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,565
一个正义联盟的席位
to our new ally.

976
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:03,861
真的吗，那这样的话，欢迎加入
Really? Well, in that case,welcome to the team.

977
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:11,077
看来我不仅有了新的星球
It appears I not only have a new planet.

978
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,913
还有了一个新的家庭
but a new family.

979
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,541
Yeah!

980
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,293
派对，走起
Let's party!

981
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,215
别着急
Not so fast.

982
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:28,177
你们要为这一系列损害负责
I'm holding you all personally responsible for this damage.

983
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,887
火星猎人
Manhunter.

984
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,430
如果你们不...
And if you don't--

985
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,104
电子机器人，为派对而生
Cy-bot lives to party.

986
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,906
很好，摇摆起来
All right. Boogie.

987
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:08,968
<i>Hmm.</i>

988
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,847
<i>Hmm.</i>

989
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,309
通话，达克赛德
Come in, Darkseid.

990
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,519
莱克斯·卢瑟呼叫达克赛德
This is Lex Luthor to Darkseid.

991
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:23,441
我能听见，人类
<i>Darkseid hears you, human.</i>

992
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:24,942
时候到了
It's about time.

993
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,569
我想逃出去
I want out of here.

994
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,154
你当然想，卢瑟
<i>Of course you do, Luthor.</i>

995
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,655
但和我有什么关系
<i>What is that to me?</i>

996
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:33,075
我给了你要的所有工具，还不止
<i>I gave you the tools you needed
and more.</i>

997
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,037
你还是失败了
<i>Still you failed.</i>

998
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,372
达克赛德，你必须得帮我
<i>Darkseid, you must help me.</i>

999
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,084
不，我不需要为你做任何事
No. I need do nothing for you.

1000
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,212
但如果我想要地球
But if I want the Earth...

1001
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:50,092
那可恶的正义联盟，必须被毁灭
and the accursed Justice League destroyed...

1002
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,972
然后我将找到同盟
then I must reach across the aisle.

1003
01:13:55,222 --> 01:14:00,436
敌人的敌人就是我的朋友
<i>For the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</i>
