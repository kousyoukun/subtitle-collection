1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,001
Huh?

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,841
Hey!

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,047
Citizens of Planet Earatavikslu,

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,523
your world has been scanned and compressed into a smaller file

5
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,887
for efficient storage and preservation.

6
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,441
You are welcome.

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,968
The largest planet database in the galaxy is one planet closer to completion.

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,762
Finally, every spot on the D through E shelf will now be full.

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,641
Ow!

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,007
Argh.

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,721
Planet Earatavikslu is now damaged.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,846
My collection can only assimilate planets in mint condition.

13
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,161
Argh.

14
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,411
Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating.

15
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,729
Circuit balance restored.

16
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,769
Now, I must calculate an alternative world that will go between Buzizz and Eberth.

17
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,804
If only there was another planet that started with E-A.

18
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,646
Searching...

19
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,361
Searching...

20
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,241
Searching...

21
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,447
Ah! Required data file located.

22
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,646
The very planet that Darkseid told me about in my digital suggestions box,

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,410
the planet Earth.

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,088
Recalculating...

25
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,848
When Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow and Batman team up,

26
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,522
criminals like Cheetah and Vandal Savage don't stand a chance.

27
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,046
And now to meet up with the rest of the league, the Justice League.

28
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,007
Strange to think that only last year, I was hesitant to join them,

29
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,206
and now I could not be more proud to be a member of most dedicated, intrepid

30
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,529
and professional band of heroes, history has ever known.

31
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,365
Let's see what they are up to.

32
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,050
92, 93, 94...

33
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,250
95, 96, 97, 98...

34
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,091
Flash, I can still hear you trying to find a hiding spot.

35
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,211
Better hurry!

36
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,529
- 99... - No.

37
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,207
100!

38
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,051
Ready or not, here I come!

39
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,046
And Green Lantern is behind the armchair.

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,844
Hey, no fair! I thought we said that you couldn't use your superpowers.

41
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,565
X-ray vision much?

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,486
I didn't. It was the only piece of green furniture in the Hall of Justice.

43
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,723
Oh. Right!

44
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,887
Cyborg is in Wonder Woman's invisible jet.

45
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,562
Dang! How does he do it?

46
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,604
Golly, Cyborg. I keep telling you,

47
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,401
Wonder Woman's plane is invisible except for the person in it.

48
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,890
Really? Why would that be helpful in any way?

49
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,521
Vic!

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,245
I found Wonder Woman!

51
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,283
Aw, I'm sorry, Wonder Woman.

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,482
You gave up your hiding space and lost a game

53
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,603
just to keep me from doing something dumb!

54
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,530
And I know how competitive you are.

55
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,611
Think nothing of it, Cyborg.

56
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,007
On Paradise Island,

57
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,290
we Amazons learn that the wellbeing of others is always what matters most.

58
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,051
She is so nice.

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,168
You couldn't find me!

60
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,965
I hid in the perfect place.

61
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,801
New York?

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,042
Argh. How does he do it?

63
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,531
Oh.

64
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,484
Superman, you really are the best at hide-and-go-seek.

65
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,801
You can find anybody.

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,566
Oh, gee. Thanks.

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,365
You know when I was in the Scouts as a kid, they always told me to be prepared.

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,885
Oh. Hey, Batman!

69
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,767
We were just, um, honing our skills of camouflage and, and, and...

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,242
Being stealthy, you now, like you!

71
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,165
Instead of performing your scheduled duties

72
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,450
and monitoring the world for injustice, you were playing hide-and-go-seek.

73
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,450
Superman was "it" and found each of you within two minutes.

74
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,530
He really is the world's greatest detective.

75
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,327
Gee whiz, Bruce, I'm sorry we didn't invite you to play. We could...

76
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,450
Secret identities are not to be mentioned while in costume.

77
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,009
As stated in the Justice League Rule Book, page one.

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,161
Our friendly exercise didn't seem like the kind of thing you'd enjoy, Batman,

79
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,042
not like, uh, fighting crime.

80
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,564
Friendly exercise. I understand completely.

81
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,400
My dark and mysterious nature terrifies criminals,

82
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,888
intimidates my enemies, and discourages friendships.

83
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,447
I'm okay with that.

84
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,210
What? Don't be silly.

85
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,760
Of course you're our friend.

86
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,050
We're all friends. We're like super friends.

87
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,050
Super best friends!

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,291
- Like Jupiter and Poseidon. - Buddies, amigos.

89
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,766
Uh, let's be honest,

90
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,851
this is the guy whose favorite pastime is dreaming up ways to defeat each of us,

91
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,565
should we suddenly turn evil.

92
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,084
I bet he is carrying kryptonite in his back pocket right now.

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,561
I don't have back pockets.

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,081
And you sure don't have faith in your colleagues here either.

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,842
It's hard to call a guy like that a friend.

96
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,524
Well, I suppose Batman's not so much of a "Let's hang out and goof off," friend.

97
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,887
He's more of a "Let's get things done" friend.

98
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,731
- Right. - Exactly!

99
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,326
Like, if we were doing something important,

100
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,405
like fighting crime or painting Wonder Woman's apartment, we'd totally call you.

101
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,965
No need to explain.

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,851
I don't need friends the Dark Knight walks alone.

103
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,247
Batman...

104
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,085
Cyborg's mobile trouble alert.

105
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,605
The threat appears to be space-based.

106
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,764
Readjust the League's satellite to coordinates delta 27, grid five.

107
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,961
On it.

108
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,726
There it is. I see something.

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Increasing resolution.

110
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,481
Oh, no.

111
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,727
You know what that is?

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,721
Yes, I do. And we have to stop it before it reaches Earth.

113
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,161
To the Javelin.

114
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,484
Prepare for launch. Everyone, buckle in.

115
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,531
Ah, who needs a seat belt? I can run faster than this bucket.

116
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,721
Three, two, one, blast off.

117
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,561
Whoa!

118
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,806
Everyone, everyone needs to buckle up, every time.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,001
Okay, I see your point.

120
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,484
Superman, you said you know what this thing is?

121
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,807
Unfortunately.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,641
That ship belongs to a sentient robot named Brainiac.

123
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,485
More like dumb-name-iac! Am I right?

124
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,406
I'm high-fiving you for that, but my heart isn't in it.

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,001
Computer, access Kryptonian database from Superman Baby rocket.

126
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,641
That's the alien rocket that brought you to Earth as an infant from a doomed planet.

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,325
Yes, I know.

128
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,650
Brainiac was designed to be the ultimate artificial intelligence.

129
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,089
Built to catalog the existing universe for future generations.

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,489
Unfortunately, due to an accident and a glitch in his programing,

131
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,123
Brainiac now scours the galaxy looking for planets to capture,

132
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,051
and permanently preserve in his growing collection.

133
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,523
Oh, I totally get the impulse.

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,643
I collect commemorative coffee mugs.

135
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,846
This one is from Niagara Falls, this one is from the Grand Canyon,

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,402
this one is a souvenir coffee mug from a factory that makes coffee mugs.

137
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,920
Please stop.

138
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,649
I did not come back to Earth to listen to Flash talk about coffee mugs!

139
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,686
How can Brainiac capture entire civilizations?

140
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,042
Two words. Shrink ray.

141
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,841
Actually, shrink-ray is a single hyphenated word, but I'll let that pass.

142
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,521
Whoa, shrink-ray.

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,405
That would be a great way to save storage space!

144
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,046
You could just shrink your Christmas decorations when you didn't need...

145
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,720
All right, team, this is a class one threat so I want you to...

146
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,041
All right, enough talk...

147
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,885
I'm not afraid of this overgrown calculator with attitude.

148
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,726
Lantern, we all know you are fearless. Just wait until...

149
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,044
At least I can make a plan for the rest...

150
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,809
So, that's what that feels like.

151
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,246
Two millimeters backward.

152
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,441
Ah, there!

153
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,651
Now, all the jars are once again even.

154
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,408
Perfect!

155
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,921
What's this?

156
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,687
The Earth data file appears to have a firewall defense.

157
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,609
Activating malware.

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,081
Please identify yourselves by name.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,971
I prefer to defeat you in alphabetical order.

160
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,810
The Justice League will not be filed, stamped, indexed, cataloged, or collected.

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,130
Then, you will be deleted.

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,529
Control, alt, destroy.

163
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,601
Missiles! If you think I'm gonna turn chicken because of a bunch of...

164
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,928
Missiles that fire laser beams?

165
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,566
Nope, still not afraid.

166
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,529
Glad I polished these bracelets.

167
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,000
Incoming!

168
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,566
Check out my spinning laser attack!

169
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,250
Oh, yeah? Well, check out my, taking-care-of-these-missiles attack.

170
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,246
I'm still working on the name.

171
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,321
Ha!

172
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,489
You keep working on that, Flash.

173
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,406
In the meantime, I'll show you how to put the bite on these bombs.

174
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,641
See what I did there?

175
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,210
Ugh, boys. Always fighting.

176
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,204
Perhaps we can solve this peacefully.

177
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,561
Hey!

178
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,882
Okay, you asked for it, buddy.

179
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,041
You gave him a black eye!

180
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,281
Whoa.

181
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,686
Ow. Probably, should have slipped into that jetpack.

182
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,770
Don't worry, Flash. I'll get you back in the fight.

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,241
Oh, no.

184
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,361
Whoa!

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,361
Huh?

186
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,043
Wonder Woman, check out the mustache.

187
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:19,371
Flash! Look at you. You are quite the go-getter.

188
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,485
And don't forget, I magnetized your space boots.

189
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:33,411
Hey, hey, now my boots will match my magnetic personality.

190
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,129
Hey, Brainiac, get a load of this.

191
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:46,729
Here's something that will really turn your head.

192
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:59,088
Too easy.

193
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,365
Destroying my peripherals is not part of the program.

194
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,931
Error, error!

195
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,761
Recalculating.

196
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,845
Units of Earth...

197
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,920
I have selected your planet for permanent back-up in my archives.

198
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,209
Prepare to be downsized.

199
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,804
Activating shrink-ray.

200
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,446
Everyone, stand back, I've got this.

201
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,801
My shrink-ray! You broke it!

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,801
Nothing like soaking up some rays from old Mr. Sunshine to charge up my powers.

203
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,926
The Earth doesn't want or need your type of saving.

204
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,410
It is under the protection of the Justice League.

205
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,481
Accessing Justice League.

206
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,010
Super speed, super circuits, super warrior, super jewelry.

207
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,328
And this one has no powers?

208
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,211
Well, he won't be a problem.

209
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,161
Super alien?

210
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,008
Ah, greetings Kryptonian, you are mis-assigned to an incorrect planet.

211
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,890
You will be re-cataloged.

212
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,601
Don't count on it.

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,201
Argh!

214
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,004
I think he's had enough, Superman.

215
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,566
You don't wanna really hurt him.

216
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,280
No, of course not.

217
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,889
Recalculating, recalculating...

218
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,211
Well, that should do it.

219
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,849
Sometimes I forget how much power I absorb from the Sun.

220
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,085
Brainiac has regained control, but is retreating.

221
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,090
Yes!

222
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,529
- All right! Yes! - All right! Great job! Yeah!

223
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,524
Bye-bye, Lame-iac, or should I call you Run-away-niac?

224
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,890
I hate to break up the party, but we only have so much oxygen

225
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,408
and Flash tends to burn through it every time he starts talking!

226
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,446
Hmm, not every time.

227
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,247
It seems that I...

228
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,286
Miscalculated the power level of the Justice League units.

229
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,605
Calculating to the nth degree, there is a 92% probability

230
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,082
of this Justice League preventing my acquisition of planet Earth.

231
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,605
Amending plan...

232
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,929
Return to Brainiac Prime for required repair and upgrade.

233
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,804
Ah. Brainiac 1.1. I ascertain that you are back.

234
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,290
Clearly, 1.4...

235
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,766
My vessel sustained damage in an altercation with super-powered beings.

236
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,525
See that she is repaired!

237
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,484
And it could do with a coat of wax.

238
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,122
Understood, Brainiac 1.1. It will be done.

239
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,006
Acknowledged, Brainiac 1.4.

240
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,321
And, Brainiac?

241
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,681
Yes, Brainiac?

242
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,401
Two coats.

243
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,723
Don't skimp like last time.

244
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,322
"Don't skimp like last time."

245
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,847
Well, if isn't the mighty Brainiac 1.1?

246
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,730
Brainiac 1.2, Brainiac 1.3, nice to see you!

247
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,249
It appears your vessel has been upgraded with a mustache.

248
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,769
And downgraded with a black eye!

249
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,965
Even the shrink-ray is inoperative.

250
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,090
Nothing that I can't handle!

251
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,203
However, I shall require

252
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,370
the premium Brainiac vessel with all the extras.

253
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,090
Although, it lacks a shrink-ray, the premium vessel is exceptional!

254
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,687
How come you get to use the premium vessel?

255
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,728
Because, Brainiac 1.3, 1.2,

256
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,726
I am Brainiac 1.1!

257
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,168
I will return to Earth and begin the cataloging process.

258
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,962
You will deliver my original vehicle to me as soon as it is repaired.

259
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,723
You're number one for now, but soon, I'll be number one.

260
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,770
You're number two for now, but soon, I'll be number two.

261
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,211
That Brainiac is a jerk.

262
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,768
Did you see the way Superman threw that thing?

263
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,765
Put some serious spin on it.

264
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,644
My boy could pitch for the Majors!

265
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,249
But I would never do that because it wouldn't be fair.

266
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,889
Anyway, I couldn't have done it without the help of my closest friends.

267
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,923
Oh, and also my work colleagues.

268
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,611
Don't mind Bat, Superman.

269
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,610
He's probably thinking up sneaky new ways to destroy you with Kryptonite

270
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,205
or defeat the rest of us in battle.

271
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,928
Even though we just saved the planet for, like, the millionth time this week.

272
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,201
Actually, Green Lantern,

273
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,449
I was thinking that we need to figure out the trajectory of Brainiac's retreat.

274
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,371
Best to be prepared when he decides to make a return visit.

275
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,127
Return? After a spanking like that?

276
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,488
Yeah, I'm bettin' we'll never see that freak again.

277
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,641
Uh...

278
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,721
Er, maybe he's just passing by.

279
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,130
Aw, his new ride is so tiny and cute.

280
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,562
Not a problem, I'll deal with it.

281
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,006
Despite our quick victory last time, Brainiac is a formidable foe.

282
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,925
I think we should come up with a game plan.

283
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,481
Yeah, okay.

284
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,728
Um, Green Lantern, do you wanna come too?

285
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,446
I'm not afraid of that monotone metronome.

286
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,846
As you've said before.

287
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,490
- Wonder Woman? - Absolutely!

288
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,610
Perhaps, I can diffuse the situation before a confrontation arises,

289
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,046
the preferred Amazon way.

290
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,966
And if not, it's beat down time.

291
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,686
Hmm, I was thinking a more in-depth plan.

292
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,011
Oh, this is gonna be good!

293
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,725
I bet Superman is really going to make this guy

294
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,571
regret coming back to our neck of the woods.

295
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,565
Hmm!

296
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,805
That's far enough, Brainiac.

297
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,006
Ah, the three most powerful units of the Justice League.

298
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,531
How fortuitous!

299
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,321
My calculations indicated that you are the exact units I need

300
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,211
to eliminate in order to acquire planet Earth.

301
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,964
That energy signature... A temporal anomaly.

302
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,806
Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, get out of there!

303
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,844
Surrender immediately, Brainiac.

304
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,407
We've already wasted enough time fighting with you.

305
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,524
Where you're going, Wonder Woman,

306
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,326
you will now have all the time in the world.

307
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,804
They're gone!

308
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,770
Brainiac destroyed Superman, and Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern.

309
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,567
No, no, no, no, I can't believe it. Brainiac won?

310
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,407
Oh, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern,

311
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,083
you may be gone forever, but you'll never be forgotten.

312
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,365
They're not dead, Flash.

313
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,450
They're simply lost in time.

314
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,320
They're what?

315
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,091
The Hall of Justice sensors picked up a temporal anomaly

316
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,487
just before Brainiac's ray fired off.

317
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,761
If I'm right...

318
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,121
And when is he not?

319
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,642
Brainiac knows he doesn't have the firepower to destroy the League.

320
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,571
But he can... Send them back through time?

321
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,489
I can trace the residual temporal currents,

322
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,968
and calibrate a device that can pinpoint when in time they've been placed...

323
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,120
And, there they are.

324
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,966
Batman, does this mean that we're gonna build what I think we're gonna build?

325
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,084
It's only been a theory, but we have to try.

326
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,321
Try what?

327
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,648
Flash, can you get us to the Batcave quickly?

328
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,088
No problem. Fast is my middle name!

329
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,321
- It is? - No.

330
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,244
Here, tow ropes. Hold on!

331
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,726
Whoa!

332
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,441
Whee!

333
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,121
Ow!

334
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,329
Pull yourself together, Cyborg.

335
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,651
Wow! The Batcave!

336
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,169
We should totally hang out here. We could play air hockey and watch movies and...

337
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,125
After we save the world, obviously.

338
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,606
Ugh, four minutes!

339
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,524
Sorry it took so long. You know what'd be great,

340
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,485
if there was a tunnel all the way from Metropolis to Gotham, right?

341
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,808
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

342
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,771
But in the meantime, we've got a job to do.

343
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,328
Huh? Huh? Huh?

344
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,889
She is beautiful.

345
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,889
She is gorgeous. She is...

346
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,361
What is she?

347
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,165
The Cosmic Treadmill.

348
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,284
She's a time machine powered by my super speed.

349
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,926
At least in theory.

350
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,166
Flash and I have been developing the plans for this device but we've never tested it.

351
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,165
Once activated, it could very well create a rift in the time stream

352
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,084
causing a chain reaction throughout the universe

353
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,090
causing all of space-time to collapse in on itself.

354
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,601
That would not be good.

355
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,401
Uh-oh.

356
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,761
Trouble alert.

357
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,927
Greetings Earth units, I am Brainiac and I bring good news.

358
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,684
This is being broadcast all over the world.

359
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,081
How do you know?

360
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,768
I've got built-in satellite, Wi-Fi, and AM-FM radio, and he's on every channel.

361
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,085
Soon I will begin scanning and cataloging every species on this planet,

362
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,921
in order to create a precise record for posterity.

363
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,761
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

364
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,010
Once finished, I will shrink your planet to a more efficient file size,

365
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,970
place it inside a glass bottle,

366
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,364
and store it safely in my library of civilizations for all eternity.

367
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,841
You're welcome.

368
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,128
Now, that part I'm not so crazy about.

369
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,651
No time for a test run.

370
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,968
We've got to retrieve Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern

371
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,248
before Brainiac finishes indexing the planet.

372
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,210
Flash, it's all up to you.

373
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,170
Definitely not crazy about this plan either

374
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,482
after that whole collapsing universe thingy you mentioned.

375
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,801
What about me?

376
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,283
Return to the Hall of Justice and call in any available auxiliary Leaguers.

377
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,966
See if you can slow down Brainiac's indexing process.

378
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,810
- On it. - Faster, Flash.

379
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,810
And, guys, good luck.

380
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,525
I don't believe in luck.

381
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,080
What do you believe in?

382
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,441
Batman!

383
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,801
Flash, hit it.

384
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,325
Faster, Flash. The Cosmic Treadmill is creating a temporal rift

385
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,323
at Wonder Woman's pre-historic location.

386
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,971
I hope this works!

387
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,486
Wow!

388
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,884
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

389
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,410
Woo-hoo! We're alive!

390
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,081
Phew. Ah, that was pretty fast, even for me.

391
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,401
I'll be glad to sit down.

392
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,722
Stay put! Flash, you have to keep running.

393
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,487
It takes an enormous amount of energy to keep the Batmobile in this timescape.

394
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,889
If you stop, the Cosmic Treadmill will snap back to our own era,

395
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,201
trapping us here forever.

396
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,845
Okay!

397
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,402
So, I guess I'll just keep running then.

398
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,761
And, you?

399
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,924
The first rule of infiltrating a different time era is camouflage.

400
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,170
I'll need to blend in in order to find out where Wonder Woman is.

401
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,641
Blend in?

402
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,647
A Bat caveman outfit? You keep that in your car?

403
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,081
Yes.

404
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,450
It looks like the temporal reading is west of here.

405
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,121
I'll go scout it out. You keep running.

406
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,407
Okay, I'll just be here on the Treadmill.

407
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,883
Running, if you need me.

408
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,443
You come with me now.

409
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,642
Let Ugh go, you beast.

410
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,086
Hmm.

411
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,686
Vandal Savage.

412
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,248
The Justice League's never-aging nemesis back in the time he came from.

413
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,411
Looks like he's been up to no good since the beginning of history.

414
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,170
Quiet, Arg!

415
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,842
Your grunting not save you.

416
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,001
My name, Ugh! And Queen am going to find me.

417
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,601
Well, you am my hostage, and when we find new country that me can rule,

418
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,686
you will be first citizen me oppress.

419
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,408
- Huh? - Don't count on it, Savage.

420
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,124
Only an uncivilized brute threatens a woman, or anyone else for that matter.

421
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,409
I not know how you know my name.

422
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,371
But why you dressed like a rat?

423
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,085
It's a bat.

424
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,051
And what have you done with Wonder Woman?

425
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,124
Me no understand your crazy talk.

426
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,927
Plus, me have no time to chew mastodon fat with you!

427
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,121
Make time.

428
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,762
You am asked for this, Rat Skins.

429
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,246
Huh?

430
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,085
Men, you am so dumb.

431
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,324
While you fight, Ugh catches you.

432
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,851
Ugh, what are you doing?

433
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,448
We take you to Cave Queen now.

434
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,041
We?

435
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,883
Yeah.

436
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,641
So I tell him,

437
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,168
there's no future in red bricks, you should invest in yellow bricks!

438
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,044
Huh?

439
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,601
Excellent.

440
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,005
With three members of the Justice League out of the way,

441
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,891
the Earth will soon have a new home...

442
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,882
In my collection right between Dzizz and Eberth.

443
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,848
Login name, Cyborg. Password, Batfan1.

444
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,250
Aquaman, status?

445
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,409
"20,000 leagues under the sea."

446
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,281
So, no go there.

447
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,448
Hawkman returned to Thanagar for molting season?

448
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,569
What is that, anyway?

449
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,811
Green Arrow is giving an archery clinic on Rann?

450
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,128
Everyone on that planet has a ray gun!

451
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,841
Huh...

452
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,451
Superman's secret weapon.

453
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,927
Hmm.

454
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,526
Desperate times call for super measures.

455
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,961
Hello?

456
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,525
What?

457
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,286
Really? The League needs me?

458
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,489
And you signed my permission slip?

459
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,768
Well, I won't let you down, Cyborg.

460
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,610
Sorry, girls, got to run!

461
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,086
Emergency!

462
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,411
Ooh, I can't wait to show the Justice League that Supergirl is a team player.

463
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,366
These rocks are strangely familiar.

464
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,886
I am in the pre-historic Batcave!

465
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,768
Me not know who you are,

466
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,442
but if not for you, me would have escaped her vengeance!

467
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,169
Now we stuck between rock and hot place.

468
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,801
Her vengeance?

469
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,525
Who is this her?

470
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,650
She who must be obeyed!

471
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,323
You am soon see for self.

472
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,925
And tremble!

473
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,330
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen, queen, queen...

474
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,322
Oh, no! She comes!

475
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,001
Who comes?

476
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,725
Wonder Woman!

477
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,484
Silence, miscreant male.

478
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,600
You've been caught helping the evil Vandal Savage escape with one of my women.

479
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,409
And for that, you will be cleansed in the fire of the mountain like roasted geese.

480
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,170
Hmm, apparently, Brainiac's time-beam

481
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,607
is so jarring it creates a form of amnesia.

482
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,844
If I can get her to remember who she is,

483
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,646
the timestream's natural elasticity should reject her,

484
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,644
sending her back to our own time.

485
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,401
But, how?

486
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,684
Lower them into the fire like the pigs they are!

487
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,082
No point in learning name now. We am doomed!

488
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,291
Wonder Woman, wait!

489
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,762
What male dares speak to our queen?

490
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,570
You may speak.

491
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,964
You don't remember me, but I have come to bring you home.

492
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,401
Home?

493
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,324
I know no home but here.

494
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,648
When queen arrived, we subjugated by Vandal Savage's cavemen.

495
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,251
She led glorious revolt against you oppressors.

496
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,766
I am not one of them.

497
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,963
Think, Wonder Woman, you know me.

498
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,248
I'm your... I'm your...

499
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,081
Co-worker.

500
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,647
I'm Batman.

501
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,685
Batman?

502
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,251
You think great Queen would ally herself with a man?

503
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,124
You may not know me, but I know you.

504
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,082
I, Batman, challenge the Queen of the Cavewomen to ritual trial by combat.

505
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,283
Or do you fear to do battle against a man?

506
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,285
I fear no man!

507
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,886
Combat, combat, combat, combat, combat, combat...

508
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,400
Oh, oh, dinosaurs!

509
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,886
Phew.

510
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,241
Batman, oh, Batman, please... Anytime now.

511
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,961
Ha!

512
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,844
I will make this quick.

513
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,648
I only have one chance at this. My timing must be perfect.

514
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,728
No rope can hold me, man!

515
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,362
I don't need your magic lasso to hold you.

516
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,962
I need it to make you tell me the truth.

517
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,686
Who are you?

518
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,044
I... I... I am Queen of...

519
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,806
The magic lasso compels you to speak the truth,

520
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,208
even a truth you've forgotten.

521
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,685
I... I...

522
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,245
I am Wonder Woman!

523
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,890
Pre-historic Persephone!

524
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,722
Batman, you rescued me, but how?

525
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,928
No time to explain, if I am right...

526
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,201
You usually are.

527
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,489
Now that you've remembered who you are, the timestream will try to correct itself

528
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,529
and you will transition back to our time.

529
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,045
It's happening already.

530
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,081
Flash and I will get the others.

531
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,527
You make sure that Brainiac doesn't shrink the Earth.

532
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,170
Ugh, my faithful servant, you are left in charge of the clan now.

533
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,926
And what we do with Vandal Savage?

534
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,848
No matter. Steer clear of evil men such as him,

535
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,324
and remember that you are more powerful together than alone.

536
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,281
What now?

537
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,807
Without Queen, we defenseless.

538
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,207
No!

539
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,368
What Queen said was true.

540
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,647
We stick together, we leave this land, find a place!

541
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,408
An island maybe,

542
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,362
where we live in peace, away from evil of man.

543
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,524
It would be paradise.

544
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,205
So, that's how it happened.

545
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,122
Better get back to Flash. He must be bored out of his mind by now.

546
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,324
Batman!

547
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,481
Staring? Why don't you take a picture?

548
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,007
It'll last longer!

549
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,689
If there's one thing I cannot abide in interplanetary drones, it's rudeness.

550
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,521
Good job, Supergirl.

551
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,041
But there's more where that came from. Stay focused.

552
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,683
Focused? Oh, they don't come much more focused than me, Cyborg.

553
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,047
Oh, look, a kitten.

554
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,525
Yay, Cyborg!

555
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,124
We're awesome and it shows.

556
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,123
We're smashing scanner drones.

557
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,321
When Justice League is on the case, Brainiac's a loser face.

558
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,121
Yay!

559
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,530
Loser face?

560
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,690
That does not even compute.

561
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,443
Stop, you are interfering with the...

562
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,441
Those drones are not cheap to build.

563
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,564
My stuff! Stop touching my stuff!

564
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,882
Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating...

565
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,722
Initiating drone defense protocol.

566
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,845
For that you get my cheer of doom.

567
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,088
Give me a D. Give me an O. Give me another O.

568
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,369
Give me a M... What's that spell?

569
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,005
Doom!

570
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,686
Woo-hoo. Nice job, Supergirl.

571
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,847
Hey, I was wondering when you'd show up.

572
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,526
Wonder Woman! Oh, I've always wanted to fight evil

573
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,331
alongside the greatest superhero in the...

574
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,488
That's an interesting outfit choice.

575
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,920
Talk later, Supergirl. Fight now.

576
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,641
Okay!

577
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,604
Robot drones don't stand a chance, we're gonna kick their underpants.

578
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,411
Go team!

579
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,566
Yeah, underpants! Whoo!

580
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,450
Oh.

581
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,961
Took you long enough.

582
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,648
There's no time to chat, Flash. Next stop, 1741.

583
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,961
Step on it.

584
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,810
Was that a joke? Step on it? Argh.

585
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,644
Who knew you were so funny, Batman?

586
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,450
Okay, okay.

587
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,326
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

588
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,241
We are on the water. We're gonna sink.

589
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,002
- Oh. - Bat-pontoons deployed.

590
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,962
Relax, Flash, the Batmobile is prepared for virtually anything.

591
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,201
Oh, really?

592
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,488
Does it come with a Bat-pirate costume?

593
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,130
Keep a sharp eye, ye scurvy dogs.

594
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,767
Fog's as thick as the devil's dandruff.

595
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,091
Avast there, swabby.

596
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,731
This deck be looking like a Tortuga shanty.

597
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,362
Remember what I told ye.

598
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,682
Aye, aye, Captain Fear, sir.

599
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,289
You said that if you couldn't eat your cod salad off the deck of the ship,

600
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,488
I'd be feeding sharks on the open sea.

601
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,126
Well...

602
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,845
Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Right away, sir.

603
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,723
Ah, well, that be more like it.

604
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,125
Captain, something coming at us fast, off the port side!

605
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,369
Hmm.

606
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,361
It be a boat.

607
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,806
It be a fish.

608
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,203
No, it's a dude surfing on a shark. Duh.

609
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,247
Oh.

610
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,522
Well, you be a long way from land there, matey.

611
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,727
I, uh,

612
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,767
lost me ship to a hungry kraken,

613
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,686
and had to commandeer that passing sea critter for travel.

614
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,927
Hmm.

615
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,683
What be your name?

616
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,170
There be those would call me Bat Beard.

617
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,807
I see no beard.

618
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,287
I shaved.

619
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,610
Well, any man that can tame a great white

620
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,770
as fearlessly as ye is welcome on me vessel.

621
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,529
Work hard and fight alongside us, and you will get part of the plunder.

622
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,961
What say you?

623
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,331
I say huzzah.

624
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,085
Huzzah!

625
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,409
Now, you yellow-bellied swabby below my contempt,

626
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,971
show him to his hammock,

627
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,371
then report back to the forecastle, throw dirt on it, and clean it all over again.

628
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,846
Aye-aye, Captain.

629
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,886
Follow me, stranger.

630
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,965
Hmm, treasure chest.

631
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,244
Away from my booty, you salty dog.

632
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,490
Huh, dude.

633
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,243
Hal, it's me, Batman.

634
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,684
Who? I thought you said you were Bat Beard.

635
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,161
If the Captain knew you were lying, he'd...

636
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,200
Well, I don't know what he'd do, but I'm afraid to find out.

637
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,801
Afraid?

638
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,605
Hal, you aren't afraid of anything.

639
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,451
Your power ring, where is it?

640
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,246
That green ring?

641
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,208
The Captain took it when he fished me out of the sea as payment to be on his crew.

642
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,290
It's locked up in his chest.

643
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,647
We have to get it.

644
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,884
It might be the only way to help you remember who you are.

645
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,121
Are you mad?

646
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,165
If the Captain found out, he'd keelhaul us.

647
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,490
Fine, I'll do it myself.

648
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,241
But I need a distraction.

649
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,851
Will you at least do that for me?

650
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,602
Oh. Uh, okay.

651
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,402
Up and down, up and down, on and on and... Brr.

652
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,085
I don't feel so good.

653
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,041
Maybe I should eat something.

654
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,682
The famous Flash emergency protein. Mmm.

655
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,961
Hey. Hey!

656
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,281
Ow!

657
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,843
Argh! Flying fish attack!

658
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,049
Oh, I really hate treadmills.

659
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,043
Whoa!

660
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,321
Dude.

661
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,607
Oh, you clumsy oaf, look what you've done.

662
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,089
You befouled my ship, you lousy landlubber.

663
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,048
You find anything interesting?

664
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,845
The number one rule of the sea, laddie,

665
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,720
keep your hands off the captain's booty.

666
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,604
There's gotta be a better way to phrase that.

667
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,611
You ratted me out, Hal?

668
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,882
I'm sorry, Bat Beard.

669
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,283
- I just... - You did good, swabby.

670
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,284
It's time for our sticky-fingered friend here

671
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,444
to take a little walk... On the plank.

672
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,801
Maybe Davy Jones will teach you not to steal what I've rightfully stolen.

673
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,288
Now, out on the plank with ye.

674
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,806
There's an old friend waiting to make your acquaintance.

675
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,210
Hal, you may not believe it now,

676
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,125
but I know that you are the most fearless man alive.

677
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,681
Be that man.

678
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,769
Stow your scuttlebutt, matey.

679
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,803
It's into the sea with ye.

680
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,125
I believe in you, Hal.

681
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,207
Har, har.

682
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,806
Huh.

683
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,171
What in the blue blazes?

684
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,803
Wrong, Captain Fear, not blue blazes, green.

685
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,771
In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight.

686
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,450
Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's light.

687
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,728
Fire on that swabby, he's bewitched.

688
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,681
I'm not your swabby anymore, Captain,

689
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,048
and I don't take orders from Fear.

690
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,042
What? Not cool, bro.

691
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,924
Dude!

692
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,248
Shiver me timbers. Tis the day Captain Fear feared the most.

693
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,081
Bet you're expecting me to admit I was wrong about you

694
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,720
just because you said all those nice words back there.

695
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,441
I said what I thought might get the job done.

696
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,561
I was right.

697
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,529
And, when are you not?

698
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,007
Uh, Batman, I am starting to turn invisible.

699
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,884
That's time repairing itself.

700
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,008
You're being sent back to our proper time.

701
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,682
- Well, Batman, what about you? - I'll be fine.

702
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,242
Go, help the others against Brainiac.

703
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,401
If I were you, I'd start swimming.

704
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,767
My finny friend is nearby and I think he wants to say hello.

705
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,884
Swim away, argh, swim away!

706
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,441
Faster!

707
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,124
Ooh, you don't look so good.

708
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,809
Flying fish stole my chicken leg, need energy.

709
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,451
This should help.

710
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,483
You have your own vitamin drink?

711
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,486
Crime never dries up, but heroes can.

712
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,251
That's why I developed my own vitamin supplement.

713
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,567
Drink up, Flash.

714
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,289
And let's go save Superman.

715
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,046
Whoa!

716
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,406
Wow, Batman, this stuff is amazing. I never felt so alive.

717
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,040
Do you have another can? I'd love another can. Can I get another can?

718
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,611
I feel like I can take on the world.

719
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,170
Uh-oh.

720
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,686
Brainiac's drones fight like the fire oxen of...

721
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,606
Chainsaw, crowbar, sugar, spice.

722
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,768
Smash those robots, don't play nice.

723
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,089
Cookies, candies, dynamite...

724
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,363
Brainiac's drones will be destroyed and exploded into a million pieces.

725
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,445
- I got this. - What? What?

726
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,090
- You got this. - Who? Who?

727
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,368
- We got this. - Woohoo!

728
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,567
- Yeah! - Yeah!

729
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,691
Ah, youth.

730
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,650
Wonder Woman, look out.

731
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,165
Hey, gang. Miss me?

732
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,451
Hal, Batman saved you too.

733
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,048
Well, I helped, but, yeah.

734
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,121
Batman.

735
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,962
So, Batman found a way to retrieve Wonder Woman and Green Lantern.

736
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,245
This stinks.

737
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,085
Oh, it's you.

738
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,329
How are the repairs to my ship progressing?

739
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,404
It's nice to see you too.

740
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,891
I didn't mean to be rude, Brainiac 1.3, but I am in the middle of something.

741
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,804
Oh, he's in the middle of something.

742
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,928
Maybe we're in the middle of something too.

743
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,766
Your ship is 83% complete.

744
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,446
Bring it as soon as it's ready.

745
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,131
Oh, can we?

746
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,283
Brainiacs.

747
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,448
Let's see how these heroes deal with a blast from the past.

748
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,760
Oh, what now?

749
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,571
Maybe Brainiac is sending a message that he's giving up.

750
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,291
Or he's opening a portal in time to return the others.

751
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,243
Or that.

752
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,442
Do you have a cheer for attacking blood-thirsty dinosaurs

753
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,641
that are about to eat us?

754
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,724
Whoa!

755
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,486
It can't be.

756
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,044
The future.

757
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:13,488
Whoa, I thought the future would be flying cars or jetpacks or robots.

758
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,486
Life forms detected. Initializing response.

759
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,846
Disintegration.

760
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,324
- Batman, something's wrong. - Hold on, Flash.

761
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,524
We're losing temporal displacement energy.

762
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,081
Time is snapping the Batmobile to its proper place.

763
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,602
- Batman! - Don't worry about me, Flash.

764
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,405
Help the others.

765
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,361
Hmm.

766
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,409
Looks like I lost my ride home.

767
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,449
Welcome to the future, Batman.

768
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,651
Superman, thank goodness I found you.

769
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,525
Do not thank goodness, it is an illusion.

770
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,287
Thank Brainiac. Don't you just love the upgrades he gave me?

771
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,169
No.

772
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,401
Yes.

773
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,290
You see, Brainiac from your era

774
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,046
figured out you were traveling through time to rescue me,

775
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,329
which means future Brainiac also became aware of your plans.

776
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,569
So, he sent me to destroy you on arrival.

777
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,724
It's so funny how this time travel stuff works, isn't it?

778
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,324
We hope you enjoy your time here in Brainiactropolis before you are vaporized.

779
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,564
Hold still, this will only sting for a brief moment.

780
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,081
Execute programing, crush, delete, destroy Batman.

781
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,921
Please remember, it's not personal.

782
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,642
That's strange, motion impaired.

783
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,810
Hmm, some kind of magnetic field.

784
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,246
Someone else is here.

785
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,562
You don't have to be a mind reader to figure that out.

786
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,122
Now, Lightning Lad.

787
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,001
Uh-oh.

788
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,363
That won't hold Brainiac-Superman for long.

789
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,128
Come with us if you'd like to avoid being smashed into Bat paste.

790
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,684
- I don't think I should trust these... - "Why should you trust us?

791
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,524
"Us? Us?"

792
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,649
Because, you really don't have any choice.

793
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,445
Oice. Oice.

794
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,087
And, yeah, I can read minds.

795
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,961
Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy, he is generating that magnetic field,

796
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,611
and Lightning Lad...

797
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,848
Electricity power, I got it

798
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,322
and I'm not even a telepath.

799
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,406
He's about to break free.

800
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,362
I don't mean to pull rank, but, technically I was the last elected leader, so...

801
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,485
, , 
Rank is the word, all right, as in your smell.

802
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,009

Soap and water are pretty hard to come by since the world ended.

803
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,686
, , 
Okay, less bickering, more escaping with our lives.

804
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,371

My Welcome Wagon program was interrupted.

805
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,531
 
I must execute program End Batman.

806
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,684
?
Who are you people?

807
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,447
, , 
We were the Legion of Super-Heroes, now, we're what's left of them.

808
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,327

Just think of us as the anti-Brainiac resistance.

809
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,848
, 
Before Brainiac came, this place was a utopia.

810
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,687
, . 
Hey, it's not all bad. There's plenty of parking spaces.

811
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,848

Welcome to resistance headquarters.

812
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,681

Ugh.

813
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,684

You'll get used to the sewage smell after a few weeks.

814
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,611

According to historical data...

815
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,207

Brainiac was unable to defeat Superman in your time,

816
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,409

so he hurled Superman into a future where Brainiac could develop the technology

817
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,608

to assimilate him and turn him into the ultimate weapon.

818
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,721
? 
Could you please not read my mind? And stop finishing my sentences for once.

819
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,166
, ?
I never read your mind, okay?

820
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,567

It's always just obvious what you're going to say next.

821
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,769

History also tells us that you and Superman were good friends.

822
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,604

Maybe we can use your special knowledge of Superman to free him.

823
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,560
, , 
Then, together, we can rise up and defeat Brainiac.

824
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,563
- ! - , ?
- Yeah! - Yeah, what do you say?

825
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,085

I've been preparing for this day for a long time.

826
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,250

There's only one way to stop Brainiac-Superman,

827
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,848
, 
but to do it, I'll need to get to the Batcave in Gotham City.

828
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,241
?
Are you crazy?

829
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,562

The streets are patrolled by Brainiac's killer robots,

830
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,563

you'd be destroyed the minute you left our hideout.

831
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,280

And not to mention Brainiac-Superman.

832
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,843
, , 
Oh, that is a good idea, Batman.

833
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,843
, 
Sorry, he was wondering if Wayne Enterprises

834
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,480

had ever constructed a tunnel from Metropolis to Gotham.

835
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,927
, 
As a matter of fact, it did.

836
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,970

Brainiac has sensors everywhere.

837
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,480
, 
If you're on the move, he'll know and he'll send Brainiac-Superman.

838
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,690

Then I'll have to hope someone slows him down.

839
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,688

You guys look like you need a pick-me-up.

840
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,530
?
How about a recharge?

841
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,241

Disintegration.

842
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,486

I don't know why you bother,

843
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,291
, 
you're never going to get a laugh out of them, they're killer robots.

844
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,201

That's why I use killer material.

845
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,081

That's a little trick Karate Kid taught me.

846
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,811
?
Think that got his attention?

847
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,610
, 
Oh, I know so.

848
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,891
, , 
Hmm, observation, Batman is absent.

849
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,011
, ...
Too bad, I was looking forward to seeing him again...

850
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,281

Before I crushed him.

851
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,807
?
Who needs Batman when you have us?

852
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,169
, , 
Resistance is pointless, Lightning Lad, no offense.

853
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,641

Argh.

854
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,968
!
Garth!

855
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,888
- ! - ?
- Rokk! - Where is Batman?

856
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,566

I need to execute my Welcome Wagon program.

857
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,366
, , 
Far from here, Brainiac-Superman, you'll never find him.

858
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,170

Don't be so sure.

859
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,361

Have a nice day.

860
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,124
. .
Gotham City. I can smell it.

861
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,606

Clearly my future self

862
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,088
-
must have followed up on Flash's suggestion of a Metropolis-Gotham tunnel.

863
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,406
. 
The Flash was right. Amazing.

864
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,291

The Batcave again.

865
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,451
1000
Now I know what 1,000 years without Alfred dusting looks like.

866
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,288
, 
If Earth survives, I should give him a raise.

867
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,480

The Batsafe.

868
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,687

Behind its rusted door lies the key to Earth's salvation.

869
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,091
, , 
Oh, hey, Batman.

870
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,766
, 
Boy, I'm a little disappointed to find you here.

871
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,768
, , ?
Fleeing to the Batcave, kind of predictable, don't you think?

872
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,883
, ?
You still resist me, Batman?

873
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,441

None can stand up to the Brainiac Collective.

874
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,126
, 
Come on, Batman.

875
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,361
?
Don't you remember?

876
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,928
, 
I am the best at hide-and-seek, you cannot hide from me.

877
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,122
, 
Don't you remember, Superman?

878
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,081

You never played hide-and-seek with me.

879
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,723
, ?
Besides, who says I'm hiding?

880
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,288
, 
So, the Dark Knight dosns his armor.

881
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,966

It doesn't stand a chance against my Super Strength.

882
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,610
, 
Now, I can complete the Welcome Wagon program.

883
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,400
, 
For your enjoyment, I have set it to music.

884
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,647
, 
So, you're in the future

885
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,042

And just so you're not bored

886
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,841

Into the Brainiac Collective

887
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,368

You will be absorbed

888
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,844

Your battle suit won't help you

889
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,447

This ain't much of a fight

890
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,889

I'm so darn invulnerable

891
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,931

Don't even fear a dinosaur bite

892
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,647
, 
Now, don't move a muscle

893
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,689

This won't hurt a bit

894
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,969

I'll melt that armor off you

895
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,522

Lickety-split

896
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,242
, 
Thank you, I knew that safe would be too rusty to open.

897
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,688
, 
Ah, your old Kryptonite stash.

898
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,800
, . 
Hey, you were right, I finally turned evil and now you get to use it on me.

899
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,523
, , 
Boy, when you plan ahead, you really plan ahead.

900
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,041
, 
Kryptonite's not part of the plan today, this is.

901
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,321
. 
Ow. Ugh.

902
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,644
...
What is...

903
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,368
, 1000
Yellow sunlight, concentrated and magnified 1,000 times,

904
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,049

enough to power up Superman and melt down Brainiac.

905
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,451
, ...
No, you'll never...

906
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,251
, , 
Fight him, Superman, I know you're still in there.

907
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,087

Argh.

908
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,409
? ?
Superman? Clark?

909
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,528

Superman is no more,

910
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,047

there is only Brainiac.

911
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,602
, 
Your friend is gone forever, Batman.

912
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,287
...
Friends...

913
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,441
...
Batman...

914
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,006
, , . 
It's me, Superman, you can do this. You can fight this.

915
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,523
, 
Do it for Earth, do it for the Justice League.

916
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,605
, , 
Batman, you did it, you saved me.

917
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,129

You could've defeated me with your Kryptonite.

918
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,091
, ...
But, your sun-ray device...

919
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,325
?
How did you know it would wake me from Brainiac's influence?

920
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,405
, 
I didn't, but I had to take that chance.

921
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,008

It's my job to prepare for the worst that this world can throw at me.

922
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,407

But I also always prepare for a friend in need.

923
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,847
,  
Thank you, Bruce.

924
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,601
, 
Now, let's go get Brainiac.

925
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,809
, ?
What, what's happening?

926
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,488
, 
Now that you remember, you're been drawn back to your own time.

927
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,001
?
Why aren't you?

928
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,568
, 
Unfortunately, I am stranded here.

929
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,966

No.

930
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,005
, 
Make my sacrifice worthwhile, Superman.

931
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,050

Make sure you stop this future from ever happening.

932
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,488
, 
Goodbye, my friend.

933
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,887
, 
Legionnaires, I knew you would find a way to survive.

934
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,805
, 
Yes, and we found something else as well.

935
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,202
, 
That's a good boy, follow me.

936
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,370

This was a bad idea.

937
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:08,924
, , 
So much trouble, so much pain, I don't wanna see a dinosaur ever again.

938
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,205
- , . - 
- Nice work, team. - Huh.

939
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,566

Superman.

940
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,442
- ! - 
- Batman did it! - I knew it.

941
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,808
, 
Especially good work from you, Supergirl.

942
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,890
, 
You're growing up fast, young lady.

943
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,970
, ?
Wait a minute, where is Batman?

944
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,411
, ?
Yes, where indeed?

945
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,806
, 
Ah, finally.

946
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,606
, 
Greetings, Brainiac.

947
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,891
1.2, 1.3, .0761
Brainiac 1.2, Brainiac 1.3, you are .0761 seconds late.

948
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,761

I just finished cataloging everything on the Earth,

949
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,361

I am ready to shrink.

950
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,928
, , 
Well, we have a surprise for you, Brainiac.

951
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,089
 2.0
The Shrink-ray 2.0.

952
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,603
- , ... - 
- You will notice, it is even superior to... - My calculations indicate

953
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,649
, , 
that I will, no doubt, find it is a booby trap

954
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,450

designed to destroy me when I activate it.

955
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,841
... , ?
You are quite correct and... Wait, what?

956
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,129
, 
Apparently, his calculations were better than ours.

957
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,569
,  1.1
Of course, I am Brainiac 1.1.

958
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,769
, 
Whatever you calculate, I calculate it first.

959
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,847

It was his calculation.

960
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,445

I calculated you would say that.

961
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,051
2
All the other Brainiacs now advance two numbers in rank.

962
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,520

That should be good for morale.

963
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,161
, 
Now, back to work.

964
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,929
, .
Booby trap deactivated, amateurs.

965
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,246
, 
Now, I have the power.

966
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,329
, , ?
Well, there's gotta be a way to go back to the future and save Batman, right?

967
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,251

Batman wants us to save the Earth from Brainiac first.

968
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,684
, 
We'll have to figure out a way to save Batman, later.

969
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,129
, , 
Oh, no, he didn't.

970
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,521

I think he did.

971
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,364
, 
Ah, mission accomplished.

972
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,485
, 
Look, up in the sky.

973
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,563
- . -  
- It's massive. - It's scary.

974
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,922
, ... ...
No, it's... It's...

975
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,566

It's a bottle.

976
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,566

Thank Hera.

977
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,165
- . - 
- You're back. - Batman.

978
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,808
, 
Brainiac has already won, we've been bottled.

979
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,884
, ?
But, how did you get here?

980
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,201

Time sphere.

981
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,768

The Legion has only one that wasn't destroyed when Brainiac took over.

982
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,930
...
It had just enough power to...

983
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,203
- , ... - 
- But, Brainiac-Superman... - Thought he destroyed the Legion.

984
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,446

But it was all an illusion projected into your mind by Saturn Girl.

985
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,929
, 
Now, let's get uncorked and un-shrunk.

986
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,851

Even with our combined strength,

987
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,162

we're gonna need more power to move that big cork.

988
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,124

I think I have just the thing.

989
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,764
, . 
Nice work, Cyborg. These jets are swell.

990
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,402
, 
Thanks, I'll build one more when Supergirl gets her pilot's license.

991
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,728
- ? - 
- Seriously? - We'll see.

992
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,086

Aw.

993
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,722
, , 
All right, team, let's all concentrate our firepower in one area.

994
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:07,961

Follow my lead.

995
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,881
, ... 
Wait for it, wait for it... Mega batarangs away.

996
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,449

Sonic screeches on maximum.

997
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,805

Heat vision activated.

998
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,166

Energy stars.

999
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,010

Lantern lasers.

1000
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,765

Speed force lightning.

1001
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,641
It's working!

1002
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,767
Huh, uncorked, one of my world's is no longer in its original packaging.

1003
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,521
This must be the work of the Justice League.

1004
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,006
They will pay.

1005
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,005
We got a bogey, 12 o'clock.

1006
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,366
It's noon already?

1007
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,726
Yeah, no wonder I'm starving.

1008
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,486
No, Supergirl, Brainiac, he's right there.

1009
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,887
Very clever.

1010
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,405
Let us see how clever you are once I shrinkify you into non-existence.

1011
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,201
Evasive maneuvers.

1012
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,044
Abrasive maneuvers.

1013
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,529
- Argh! Argh! - In your face-ive maneuvers.

1014
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,406
We've got to figure out a way to turn off his shrink-ray.

1015
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,162
I have an idea, but it means you have to keep him distracted.

1016
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,885
Consider it done, Batman.

1017
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,723
All right, team, you heard the man, let's do this.

1018
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,051
Super-speed spin attack.

1019
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,961
Argh.

1020
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,650
Air brakes, engage.

1021
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,002
Brainiac's brain.

1022
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,401
Hmm.

1023
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,811
You Earthlings give me such a headache.

1024
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,567
Fascinating.

1025
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,567
Enough.

1026
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,368
Your silly sounds and imaginary words do not even compute.

1027
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,961
Argh!

1028
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,286
We're losing this thing.

1029
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,964
I don't mean to be negative, but we're doomed.

1030
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,926
Wrong, Flash.

1031
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,609
We've only just begun.

1032
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,285
Cyborg, execute plan M.

1033
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,889
It's time for our secret weapon,

1034
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,811
Justice League, initialize Mecha-leaguer.

1035
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,808
This does not compute.

1036
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,204
Go, Mecha-leaguer.

1037
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,608
Okay, Brainiac, time to pick on someone your own size.

1038
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,404
Well, almost your own size.

1039
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,961
You would match your pathetic automaton

1040
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,930
against the most advanced robot in the universe?

1041
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,931
Fatal error... Argh!

1042
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,761
Monolog successfully averted, thanks to my speed fist.

1043
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,406
You're welcome, everybody.

1044
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:44,765
Two, four, six, eight, who do we love to hate? Brainiac, Brainiac, Brainiac!

1045
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,000
Come on, Cyborg, let's do our spinning kick.

1046
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,727
Oh, yeah.

1047
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,366
Ow.

1048
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,881
Let's do this.

1049
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,811
Forming Green Sledgehammer of Justice.

1050
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,922
It's time to surrender, Brainiac.

1051
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,361
Never.

1052
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,291
I will now shrink you out of existence.

1053
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,001
Wonder Woman, now.

1054
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:42,168
That wasn't my shrink-ray, it was my growth ray, but how?

1055
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,731
Easy, Brainiac.

1056
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,490
While I was in your brain, I reconfigured the circuits of your shrink-ray device,

1057
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,966
simultaneously, reversing its polarity.

1058
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,451
So, instead of shrinking us, you grew us.

1059
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,446
And, before you think you can use either of them again...

1060
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,804
My rays, no.

1061
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,805
No!

1062
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,369
Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating... Ow.

1063
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,843
I am defeated.

1064
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,051
But with my programing to collect stymied,

1065
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,290
this unit has no choice but to self-destruct,

1066
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,920
taking everything in this vicinity with it.

1067
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,720
10...

1068
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,851
- Nine... - Oh, man.

1069
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,690
- Eight... - I thought we just won this thing.

1070
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,881
- Hold on, Brainiac. - Seven...

1071
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,570
- You say that all you need to do... - Six...

1072
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,529
is fulfill your programing to collect?

1073
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,205
Five... Affirmative.

1074
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,363
- Four... - Stop your countdown.

1075
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,689
- I have a solution. - Three...

1076
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,321
Pause.

1077
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,687
Ah, a 1958 Indian Head penny.

1078
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,009
This will be a perfect place to start my new collection.

1079
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,725
Query, does anyone have more coins?

1080
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,922
I must collect them all.

1081
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,926
So, in order to keep his self-destruct programing at bay, he's collecting coins?

1082
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,526
What happens when he gets them all?

1083
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,040
Impossible.

1084
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,569
They mint new coins every year, so his collection can never end.

1085
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,043
Ingenious!

1086
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,249
Batman, I wanna say thank you for saving us.

1087
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,564
And I'm really sorry for saying that we were merely work friends.

1088
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,249
It's obvious by the way you were able to snap us out of our amnesia

1089
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:49,282
that you know a lot about us, as only a true friend would.

1090
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,082
Thank you for being our friend.

1091
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,761
You're welcome.

1092
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,929
And now I have something to say.

1093
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,688
This team is in sore need of discipline.

1094
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,241
The next threat to Earth is going to find us prepared.

1095
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,441
Why?

1096
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,923
Because of this new training exercise I devised called...

1097
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,411
Hide-and-seek.

1098
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,767
Not it.

1099
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,521
Not it.

1100
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,967
Wait, what?

1101
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,287
You're it.

1102
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,362
Oh, man, I'm it, again?

1103
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,807
Huh.

1104
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:32,571
100, 99, 98, 97, 96,

1105
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,684
95... You know, I'm starting at 50.

1106
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,127
50, 49...
