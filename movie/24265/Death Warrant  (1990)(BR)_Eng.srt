1
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,219
I think he's inside.
I'm gonna check it out.

2
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,638
Burke, wait for backup.

3
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,350
He killed my partner.
I'm not waiting.

4
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,729
Listen, Burke, this is
LA, not Canada. We have procedures here.

5
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,773
You can't handle this alone.

6
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,280
- What's the problem?
- Hey, man. What you doing here?

7
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,532
I'm busy. Scram.

8
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,826
I'm gonna teach you a lesson in manners.

9
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,207
- I'm gonna get you, man!
- Like I said, I'm going in.

10
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,876
Burke... Burke!

11
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,581
Time to go to sleep...
and join your old partner.

12
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,548
I'm the Sandman.
You can't stop me.

13
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,025
You're under arrest.

14
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,543
Detective Burke.
Have a seat.

15
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,840
Tom Vogler, attorney general.

16
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,094
On my right is Ben Keane,
on your left is Sam Walden.

17
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,555
I represent the governor.
I'm heading his task force on prisons.

18
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,100
I'm with the State Board of Corrections.

19
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,520
- And who are you?
- Amanda Beckett.

20
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,063
She works for me.

21
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,566
Detective Burke specialized
in undercover work

22
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,445
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
stationed in Quebec.

23
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,865
You followed Christian Naylor,
the Sandman, to LA.

24
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,412
We've had problems in one of
our prisons: Harrison Penitentiary.

25
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,622
It's a local piece, small-town news.

26
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,917
The assistant warden
was murdered.

27
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,002
Now a guard has intimated

28
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,797
that it might be linked
to the deaths of some prisoners.

29
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,799
Nine in the last few months.

30
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,636
We've got a gubernatorial election
coming up this fall.

31
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,014
Prisons are already an issue.
We don't want this to be part of it.

32
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,893
The governor has put me in charge
of rectifying this little mishap.

33
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,148
We wanna send you undercover
into Harrison as a prisoner.

34
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,530
You're from Quebec.
No one in jail will recognize you.

35
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,492
Only we will know you're an officer.
You'll be sentenced for armed robbery.

36
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,745
Armed robbery is
a respectable crime among inmates.

37
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,791
It's implicitly violent.
They respect violence.

38
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,043
We're also assigning a partner of sorts.

39
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,173
Amanda will act as your
liaison. She'll be posing as your wife.

40
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,675
Amanda will relay information.
Through her,

41
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,012
we will closely monitor the operation.

42
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,726
Well, Detective? What d'you say?

43
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,107
I'll let you know.

44
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,865
Would you like me
to file those papers?

45
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,202
The sooner the better.
You always do a good job.

46
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:19,331
- So we'll see you tomorrow night?
- Have Helen call if she wants anything.

47
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,708
- I will.
- OK. Bye.

48
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,710
A pleasure meeting you, Mr. Burke.

49
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,048
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.

50
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,509
He's like a father to me.

51
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,719
I've been working for him
ever since I graduated law school.

52
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,137
When was that?

53
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,431
Last year.

54
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,771
Is there a problem, Detective Burke?

55
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,274
You don't have enough experience
to be on this case.

56
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,945
Let's get something straight here,
Detective.

57
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:55,408
I'm no girl Friday.
I graduated top in my class at Stanford.

58
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,161
If you're uncomfortable with the fact
that I'm a woman,

59
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,080
it's your problem, not mine.

60
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:06,294
OK. Check the files of
any serial killers at Harrison prison.

61
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,047
Then you'll take the case?

62
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,801
I'll see you Tuesday.

63
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,554
I'll get to work.

64
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,559
Louis...

65
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,397
...you're getting wet.

66
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,844
Listen up!

67
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,724
Clasp your fingers in front of you.

68
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,854
And don't move.

69
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,484
I am Sergeant DeGraf.

70
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,988
I decide when you eat...

71
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,908
...when you shower...

72
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,452
...when you have visitors.

73
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,455
You are fish.

74
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,666
New arrivals.

75
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,670
People will try to hurt you...

76
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,089
...rob you...

77
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,595
...even rape you.

78
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,699
He said "don't move".

79
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,327
Very good.

80
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:53,420
It's important that you obey my rules.

81
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:09,728
Rules can make the difference
between your life and your death.

82
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,860
I'm Dr. Gottesman.
Any communicable diseases?

83
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,111
Not yet.

84
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,030
Excuse me?

85
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,492
You're Burke, right?

86
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,290
You have AB-negative blood.
That's very rare.

87
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,211
OK, take it into the next room, please.
Come on, move it.

88
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,555
Your identification number
is 72688.

89
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,475
Memorize your number: 72688.

90
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,770
This is your identification card,
Mr. 72688.

91
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:56,191
Your new home is C level, cell C-71.
Next!

92
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,033
- It's dead.
- Excuse me?

93
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,661
The eye. You were looking at it.
It's dead.

94
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,331
- Got stabbed in it.
- Stabbed in the eye?

95
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,460
Yeah, I got stabbed in the eye.

96
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,005
4:27.

97
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,091
OK, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

98
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,844
Meal shift starts every morning at 6:10.

99
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,139
Lunch is noon straight up,
dinner's at 6:30pm.

100
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,852
You can take a shower once a day. Check
for fungus and body lice. Any questions?

101
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,397
Your identification number is 72689.

102
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,983
Memorize your number: 72689.

103
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,529
72689. Right. My name is Burke.

104
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,698
That's your ID card, Mr. 72689.

105
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,536
Your new home is C level,
cell C-68. Next!

106
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,870
Thanks.

107
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,961
OK, you've got your towel,
you've got your toothbrush...

108
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:51,139
What're ya doin' here?
And whaddaya think you're lookin' at?

109
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,474
I'm new here.

110
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,978
I don't care what you are.
You think you can just sleep here?

111
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,274
Real estate. Cost you $500.

112
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,113
- Don't have any money.
- Oh, you don't have any money.

113
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,115
Well, that's OK.

114
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,951
You can punk.

115
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,037
Excuse me?

116
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,583
You get down on your hands and knees...

117
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,254
...and you pay,
just like any other cherry.

118
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,469
- I don't think so.
- Oh... you don't think so?

119
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,183
Possibly... you might wanna reconsider.

120
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,358
I don't pay, I don't punk.

121
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,235
OK, OK, take it easy.

122
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,364
I was jerkin' you around.
Don't have a hairball about it.

123
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,408
Look, you want the top bunk?
Take it.

124
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,203
- The bottom one would be nice.
- You got it.

125
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,371
Thanks.

126
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,769
- 72689, remember?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember.

127
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,146
You don't wanna eat that.

128
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,315
What's wrong with my food?

129
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,486
Hey, nigger...

130
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,906
Are you talking about me, ese?

131
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,993
Perez, we keep to ourselves now.

132
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,745
- We don't give a shit about you people.
- Oh, yeah?

133
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,665
- Hey, listen, let him go.
- Hey, it's on me!

134
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,750
- Let him go.
- It's cool, ese.

135
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,926
Fuckin' kill you, man!

136
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,220
You dead, ese! Puto!

137
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,518
You fuckin' dead, ese!
You dead!

138
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,396
Let me go, homeys.

139
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,084
I'll talk to you later.

140
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,756
Hawkins.

141
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,014
I know. Always the nigger's fault.

142
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,025
You're not gonna last too long.

143
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,695
- Is that a threat?
- No.

144
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,033
It's a promise.

145
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,542
It never happened!

146
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,711
Back to dinner!

147
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,347
You're a rata, ese.

148
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,224
Fuckin' dead.

149
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,727
Puto!

150
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:40,118
What's the matter with you?
Can't you see this is a black table?

151
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,208
Stick with your own kind.
Trust no one now.

152
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,795
- What about you?
- What about me?

153
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,006
You don't know who I am.

154
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,468
You don't know anything.

155
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,221
Hey, fish!

156
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,518
Hey, why don't you sit with us, fish?

157
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,913
Sit down, bright boy.

158
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,089
- So what are you in for?
- I was a bad boy.

159
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,674
Aw...

160
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,217
And you?

161
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,890
Me and Keel here,
we got "the big bitch": Habitual.

162
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,602
See these?

163
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,233
Those are the people he's killed.

164
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,486
That's very special.

165
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,870
Rack 'em up, Jack!

166
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,172
Begin count.

167
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,676
Tier 2-C, 69.

168
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,096
Tier 2-C, 68.

169
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,109
Pruno.

170
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,655
We make it ourselves.

171
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,259
It's good for what ails ya.

172
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,264
Saw ya helpin' out that nigger, Hawkins.

173
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,934
Not good. It's bad mojo.

174
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,978
Most times you can't even trust
your own kind in this place,

175
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,437
you know what I mean?

176
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,365
Hey, Konefke...

177
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,202
...how long have you been here?

178
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,125
Maybe... six years.

179
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,591
I hear a lot of guys are dying.

180
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,514
Konefke?

181
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,685
Yeah, maybe.

182
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,855
But I don't see so well no more.

183
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,608
Like one of those monkeys
you hear about.

184
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,738
Hear no evil, see no evil.

185
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,599
- Look where you are.
- What?

186
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,684
Ain't nothing wrong
with where I'm at...

187
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,438
Hi, Louis.

188
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,067
- That's a nice outfit.
- Thank you.

189
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,528
Are you trying to get me killed?

190
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,531
You're supposed to be my wife,
not a princess.

191
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,076
I didn't realize...

192
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,079
Pay attention next time.

193
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,962
I ran your MO check
on serial killers here.

194
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,134
Nothing matches up.
I checked all the death certificates.

195
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,596
All the victims died of puncture wounds
to the back of the skull.

196
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,809
Maybe it's a serial killer,
but I'm thinking maybe it's gangs...

197
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,061
...like ritual killings.

198
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,356
Let's concentrate on the victims.

199
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,444
OK, the last one was Alvin Barrett.

200
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,864
His cellmate. I'll talk to him.

201
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,284
You did good.

202
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,788
Thanks.

203
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,916
I need you to get me some money.

204
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,585
I'll have them credit
your prison account.

205
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:46,298
That's no good. I need real cash
to get anything done here.

206
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,843
Inmates aren't allowed to have cash.

207
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,055
You'll find a way to bring me
the money... easy.

208
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,850
Louis, I don't know if I can do that.

209
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,109
This is my life we're talking about.

210
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,113
I'll get you the money.

211
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,876
Tell the kids Daddy loves them.

212
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:30,301
I'm telling you... I won't condone it.

213
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,180
Mr. Keane, if you won't authorize
the money, I'll give it to him myself.

214
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,475
Don't play games with me, Ms. Beckett.

215
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,936
You are a liaison on this case
and nothing more.

216
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,105
Ben! Take it easy.

217
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,281
Don't let him get to you.

218
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,951
Another one of your lovely peers?

219
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,704
Hi, Helen.

220
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,957
Thank you, Rosarita.
I'll do it.

221
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,879
Oh, I stopped asking Tom
about these investigations years ago.

222
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,798
It's all so sordid anyway.

223
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,469
- I thought politics interested you.
- No, not any more.

224
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:18,015
Since I got out of the hospital,
things have taken on a new perspective.

225
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,575
Hey, puto. Remember me?

226
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,039
Culero!

227
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,793
I want you to meet my homey. Bruce!

228
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,175
He likes to kick the shit
out of white trash like you, boy.

229
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,843
Culero?

230
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,557
So what you gonna do?

231
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,089
- Where'd you get all those books?
- My wife. We like to read a lot.

232
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,802
Shit. The only thing I read
is girlie-magazine letters.

233
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,096
Get back.

234
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,974
Wait, listen to this one.

235
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:30,564
"Dear Sirs, I never thought
this would happen to me

236
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:35,152
but I was workin' the late shift when
this big-titted momma comes up to me..."

237
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,200
Shit, you think any of this
really happens?

238
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,118
I Don't know.

239
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,745
It never happened to me!

240
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,292
Hawkins, you know him?

241
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,754
Thanks.

242
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:40,217
- Hello, guys. You miss me?
- It's the Lone Ranger!

243
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:44,096
Hi-ho, Silver...
What's up, kemo sabe?

244
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,434
The man just waltzes right on in here

245
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,729
and visits with the happy old Negroes.

246
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,026
You a lobo, Burke.

247
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,653
- I'm a lobo?
- Yeah.

248
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,158
You know how wolves stake out
their territory, pissin' on things?

249
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,869
I figure you pissed on
just about everything around here.

250
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,749
- You know everything, right?
- Been here a long time.

251
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,377
- What are you in for?
- Murder.

252
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,174
Let me guess. You're...

253
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,470
- You're innocent, right?
- No.

254
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,851
I choked that son of a bitch,
sure as I'm sittin' here.

255
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,978
Been here over ten years.

256
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:37,316
That's a long time to be rollin' smokes
and countin' cockroaches.

257
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,280
- What's that?
- Makin' shot for zip guns.

258
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,327
Scary times.

259
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,454
People gettin' spiked
in the head and shit.

260
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:57,252
Gotta learn to defend yourself,
so you don't get dusted.

261
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,883
You probably figure I owe you somethin'
'cause of what you did the other day.

262
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,262
Barrett, who killed him?

263
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,764
He was my friend.

264
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,769
Let me tell you somethin', boy.
I don't owe you jack shit.

265
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:21,151
You wanna know what happened
to your friend, see the Priest.

266
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,694
The Priest?

267
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,614
That's all I'm sayin'.

268
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,246
The lower you go,
the funkier it gets in this place.

269
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,665
Down here, the guards won't even come.

270
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,293
This guy I'm gonna introduce you to,
the Priest, man...

271
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,461
He's part fuckin' snake!

272
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,589
You think I'm shittin' ya,
but wait till you see his eyes.

273
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,509
Don't look at him too long, though,
gives me the fuckin' creeps.

274
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,511
I'm tellin' ya, you gotta
cover your ass down here,

275
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,430
and I mean that literally, man.

276
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,853
This is gonna blow your mind, man.
You gotta see this.

277
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,375
♪ And when I hold your hand

278
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,046
♪ Close to my heart...

279
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,009
Go on.

280
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,888
♪ I hope we never part

281
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:36,351
♪ I may not own a thing at all...

282
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,439
What are you talkin' about?
That's not the deal we made.

283
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,983
- Priest...
- Listen!

284
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,279
Look, I want my stuff now.

285
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,575
Like I started sayin' before...

286
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,828
Priest, this is Burke.

287
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:59,666
Yeah. I heard you went airborne
on Perez.

288
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,878
You want a lady?

289
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,547
No.

290
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,259
He thinks he's too good for me,
Priest.

291
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,220
What's wrong with my ladies?

292
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,266
Nothing. I just need some help.

293
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:35,786
I help lots of people.
I get Jersey hormone pills.

294
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,289
Is that the kinda help you want?

295
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,959
Alvin Barrett, who killed him?

296
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,420
Someone punched a hole in his head.

297
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,630
Why?

298
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,758
I can't just tell you
these things.

299
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,095
I give you a little, you taste it.

300
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,597
That's how things work.

301
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,728
You could talk to Myerson,
Barrett's former cellmate.

302
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,814
He's in solitary now,

303
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,901
but he works in the infirmary,
night shift.

304
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,697
He can fill prescriptions,
if you got the money.

305
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,867
Sure you don't wanna sample my goods?

306
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,413
I'll take a rain check.

307
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,676
We got another one.

308
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,096
He won't be home for dinner.

309
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,563
- What is this?
- Goddamn medical waste.

310
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,780
Medical waste.

311
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,877
- You Myerson?
- Whaddaya want?

312
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,337
I need some medicine.

313
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,507
I got prescription drugs,
morphine and uppers.

314
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,510
I hear you were Barrett's cellmate.
He was a good kid.

315
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,929
- Yeah, well, he's dead now.
- Yeah, yeah.

316
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,515
Yeah, drugs. Bad news.

317
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,145
No way! He was as green as grass.
He never did nothin'.

318
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,647
A convenience-store robbery
and that's it.

319
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,234
- Maybe he was in a gang, then?
- I said he was clean.

320
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,694
What are you so curious about?

321
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,574
He was my friend.
Got spiked in the head.

322
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,368
Maybe you know who did it.

323
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,166
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Oh, yes, you are.

324
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,709
Hey, fuck you.

325
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,339
Hey, what is this?

326
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,925
- What's this?
- Soda pop.

327
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,346
- You're gonna drink soda pop.
- Please, man, don't!

328
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,141
Please, man, I didn't do nothin'.
Christ, they'll kill me if I talk.

329
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,561
- A guard let him in, not me.
- Lock up, five minutes!

330
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,854
Move it!

331
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,483
I'll talk to you.

332
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,499
- Hello?
- It's Burke. I've got something.

333
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,876
Oh... Um...

334
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,128
Hang on a sec.

335
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,674
- OK, I'm ready.
- Barrett's cellmate is scared.

336
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,802
Whatever's going on,
the guards are involved.

337
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,638
I need to see the victims' files.

338
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,640
The files haven't been transferred
to computer yet.

339
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,642
They're still at the prison.

340
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,899
- What are you doing?
- Right now?

341
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,570
Eating dinner.

342
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,492
Burke?

343
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,664
Burke, is there anything else?

344
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,501
I'll be in touch.

345
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,263
Have a nice little chat?

346
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,063
- I need the key to the records room.
- That can be arranged.

347
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,451
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

348
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,205
What have you got here, Hawk?

349
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,374
A load of shirts
for the reception desk.

350
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,388
OK... you got me.

351
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,559
Takin' some pruno
over to the guys in Storage.

352
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,688
- You know I'm gonna have to take that.
- Sure.

353
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,816
You ever actually taste that stuff?

354
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,905
- I don't think so.
- All right, then.

355
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,950
Well, maybe... Let me try some.

356
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,233
Oh, man!

357
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,193
You gonna have to develop
a taste for it.

358
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,612
You just can't go wadin' into the shit.

359
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,830
"SLRH..."

360
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,840
"Arrival..."

361
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,467
What's the connection?

362
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,853
- What was that?
- What was what?

363
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,390
- I must be goin' crazy.
- Nah!

364
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,780
Lotta old ghosts
hangin' around this place.

365
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,115
Let's get outta here.

366
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,543
Only the murder victims
have the "SL" notation.

367
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,923
The victims are brand-new,
no drugs, no gangs...

368
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,259
...all different ages and race.

369
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,055
I can check with the mainframe system.

370
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,226
Maybe "SL" is some sort of
departmental abbreviation.

371
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,312
I've got the guy for you.
I've worked with him before.

372
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,814
He's a real pro.

373
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,816
He'll do the hacking for you.

374
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,362
And don't tell Keane about this, OK?

375
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,583
- You know this is illegal, don't you?
- Sort of illegal.

376
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,836
Do you mind?

377
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,964
Are you kidding? I love it!

378
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:30,552
See, I like to think of myself as
a renegade. You know, like a cowboy.

379
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,265
Yeah, I'm a computer cowboy.
That's what I am.

380
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,113
- Well?
- Well what? It's checking.

381
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,534
"SL" could stand for virtually anything,
or nothing at all.

382
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,210
So, you got a boyfriend or somethin'?

383
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,215
The computer looks for combinations
of words beginning with "SL".

384
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,760
Then it sees if there are any files
in the system that are named that.

385
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,722
Shit! I'm missing Star Trek.

386
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,475
You wanna watch Star Trek?

387
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,393
No.

388
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,062
All right. So...

389
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,732
We got something here!

390
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,695
Now we see where the files are
most commonly accessed from.

391
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,948
Bingo!

392
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,242
- That's it. That's the file.
- Yeah.

393
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,290
Shit! I need the password.

394
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,126
That's OK. It's a start.

395
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:52,467
Give me a day or two, and I can locate
any terminals it's been accessed from.

396
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,552
You'd find out whose file it was.

397
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,224
Great. Come on, I'll take you home.
Your parents'll kill me.

398
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,100
Who needs parents?

399
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,854
We're both adults... aren't we?

400
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,815
No. I'm an adult...

401
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,735
...and you're a kid.

402
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,112
And your hormones are workin' overtime.

403
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,198
Come on, I'll take you home.

404
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,122
I'd rather not tell Keane
what I'm doing with the computers.

405
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:27,043
Burke thinks we can get it done
a lot quicker without his interference.

406
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,797
Detective Burke may be
interfering with your work habits.

407
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,799
We have procedures for a reason.

408
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,053
- I know what I'm doing, Tom.
- I hope you do.

409
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,973
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.

410
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,225
Don't worry.

411
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,366
Damn it! Took you long enough.

412
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,245
You want to talk now?

413
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,291
Look, I found out some things
about what they did to Barrett.

414
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,459
He didn't deserve what they did to him.

415
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,964
Look, we used to smuggle out
some drugs from overstock.

416
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,008
Well, I was in surgery last night...

417
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,761
Shit! Gottesman!

418
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,348
If he finds his keys missing, I'm dead!

419
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,766
Relax.

420
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,852
Don't worry.

421
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,939
I need protection 'cause another guy
got spiked last night.

422
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,190
This is serious shit!

423
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,568
- Shh, quiet.
- Shit.

424
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,903
I've got to get this cell key
back to Priest.

425
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,037
Protection...

426
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,539
I need protection.

427
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,721
Lady-killer.

428
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,724
I just thought you'd like to know...

429
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,393
...I think somebody's gonna pay you
a visit tonight.

430
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,812
I'd think twice about sleeping.

431
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,192
Thanks.

432
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,070
I just hate to see
a good man go to waste.

433
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,291
I figured out the password.

434
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,211
I've had the computer
run word variations for hours.

435
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,756
Of course, you know, it's a special
program that I devised myself.

436
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,303
You know, I was reading this article
in a men's magazine

437
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,265
about the virility of men
in their middle to late teens and...

438
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,101
- Right.
- Just do it, Tisdale.

439
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,103
Here we are.
Right, here we go.

440
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:58,194
Morpheus was the Greek god of sleep.
I'm a whiz at mythology.

441
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,321
Your criminals have a sense of humor.

442
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,785
- Yes! We're in!
- You're kidding me.

443
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,789
No.
Is there anything else you need?

444
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,959
Print it out.
Can you make a copy of this file?

445
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,086
- Sure I can.
- Great.

446
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,174
What is it doing?

447
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,468
Someone is destroying
it from the other end.

448
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,721
- Well, stop it.
- I can't.

449
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,140
We just have to hope
it started the print copy first.

450
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,452
- Where was this file accessed from?
- The infirmary.

451
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:52,874
I checked the other abbreviation. "HLA"
is a coding system for tissue typing.

452
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,293
I'm checking that other point
of access.

453
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,754
It's definitely someone outside
the prison.

454
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,131
OK, that's our key player.

455
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,260
This is my beeper number.
Call me when you find it out.

456
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,846
Tisdale, you... are a stud.

457
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,443
The Sleep file contained
a list of prisoner ID numbers

458
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,446
strung together,
along with the prisoners' blood types.

459
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,282
Every person who was
on that list has been killed.

460
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,117
It's a hit list.

461
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,788
Exactly. Each victim had
a physical days before they were killed.

462
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:36,751
Each one came up clean. You know,
no diseases, no drug addiction, nothing.

463
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,338
I think that someone from the outside
is working with the guards.

464
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,216
Keane.

465
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,094
Keane would have access to the files.

466
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,891
Burke... there's something else.

467
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,562
Your number's next on the list.

468
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,441
What's goin' on here?

469
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,443
Help me.

470
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,280
- Jesus! Grab him!
- Help me!

471
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,736
What are you doing in my prison?

472
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,822
Somethin' wrong with your mouth?

473
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,051
You killed Konefke.

474
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,847
I didn't do it.

475
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,184
I know.

476
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,403
Strip him!

477
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,285
♪ When I know you

478
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,537
♪ You... you!

479
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,998
♪ When I know you

480
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,542
♪ When I know you like I know... ♪

481
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,678
You got a big mouth, Jersey.

482
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,514
Romie...

483
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,725
Hey, man, I didn't say no names.

484
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,398
I didn't say you.

485
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,606
Who's there?

486
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,403
What's goin' on? Whaddaya want?

487
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,364
We wanna talk.
Just like Burke.

488
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,617
I didn't talk to Burke.
I didn't say nothin'.

489
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,120
Who said I talked to Burke?
It's bullshit.

490
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,956
What... what is that?

491
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,086
Shit! God...

492
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,797
Hey, wait a minute! You can't do this.

493
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,551
You gotta hear my side.
I didn't say nothin'. Somebody's lyin'.

494
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,261
Somebody's fuckin' lyin' on me!

495
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,264
Hey, I'm gonna faint.
You can't do this, man!

496
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:04,435
Oh, God, just stop. Wait a minute.
Just wait one second!

497
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,646
What did you say to Burke?

498
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,565
Who said I talked?
How did ya find that out?

499
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,150
That's bullshit, man!

500
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,819
Don't! No! No!

501
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,529
I swear to God, I didn't do it!

502
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,783
Stop it! What are you doin'?
Are you crazy, man?

503
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,119
Whaddaya want me to do?

504
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,998
I'll give you anything!
Whaddaya want? Stop it! No!

505
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,084
You're a liar, Myerson.

506
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,710
No! Please!

507
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,296
Please! No!

508
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,637
Somebody! No!

509
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,863
This is ridiculous.

510
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,202
Do you wanna see your... husband?

511
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,749
Then bring in a female guard.

512
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,585
None seem to be available.

513
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,007
Up with the arms.

514
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,773
I don't know.

515
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,403
I'm sorry, missy...

516
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,281
...but you're gonna
have to remove your clothes.

517
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,536
Your husband is waiting.

518
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:23,657
Clean up and get dressed.
Your pretty little wife wants to see ya.

519
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:47,181
- You have a half hour, Burke.
- Yeah, have a good time there, buddy.

520
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,116
- God...
- It's OK.

521
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,329
- Who did this to you?
- The guards.

522
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:14,833
They let two prisoners into my cell.
One of them had an ice pick.

523
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,836
At least we know
who's been spiking people.

524
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,341
What about you?

525
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,179
Nothing.

526
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,065
You look like hell.

527
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,568
So do you.

528
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,539
Um...

529
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,625
I checked on Dr. Gottesman and, um...

530
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:04,049
- And?
- He didn't get into med school here.

531
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,136
He went to South America.

532
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,723
South America?

533
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,392
- And um...
- And?

534
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:20,190
There were... a couple of...
of um...

535
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,069
...malpractice suits.

536
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,376
You're so beautiful.

537
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:16,038
You guys are all spooked 'cause you
think there's some big conspiracy.

538
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,957
Priest, you know as well as I
what's goin' on, man.

539
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,169
A brother got his brains scrambled
just last night,

540
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,338
straight through the skull
like a piece of meat.

541
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,965
Could be me next, could be you.

542
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,469
So, big white superman
gonna save our asses?

543
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,971
What makes you think
we wanna be saved?

544
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,892
Burke needs our help.
He needs a distraction.

545
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,822
- Good work, Hawkins.
- Thank the Priest.

546
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,324
- Shit!
- Yeah, it's locked.

547
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,494
- They cart medical waste day and night.
- Where does it go?

548
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,831
I don't know. They got a special
pick-up for it. It's hazardous.

549
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,207
Oh, yeah?

550
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,127
Let's see what's inside.
Watch your eye.

551
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,170
Funny! Hurry up.

552
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,566
Hold this.

553
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:34,741
- It's a human heart.
- Oh, God.

554
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,626
- What's going on?
- New dude being brought in.

555
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,547
- All this for a new fish?
- Man, this ain't no fish.

556
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,090
This is the man!

557
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,391
Sandman!

558
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,595
Long time no see, Burke.

559
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,065
Would you like to know what's out there?

560
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,236
Would you like to know
what's on the other side?

561
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,659
You know what prisoners hate
more than anything else, Burke?

562
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,666
Prisoners hate cops
more than anything else.

563
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,793
Fuckin' pigs!

564
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,049
Every killer in this prison
is gonna know who you are.

565
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,053
And you're not gonna know
when it's comin'.

566
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,359
Let him go.

567
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,038
Bring me a dream, Burke.

568
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,541
Bring me a dream.

569
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,935
Hey, policía!

570
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,941
Who's gonna protect your ass,
policeman?

571
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:00,072
- You belong to me!
- The only good cop...

572
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,940
That's a load of shit
you were givin' us.

573
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,650
Barrett wasn't your friend.

574
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,115
I'm trying to stop what's going on here.
Doesn't that make a difference?

575
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:47,828
In the cage, man,
a cop is worse than a baby-raper.

576
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,667
Why are you still here?
You're a dead man.

577
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,213
I need your help.

578
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,093
It's too late.

579
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,887
Hawkins... Hawkins!

580
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,225
Hawkins! Hawkins!

581
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,135
Ms. Beckett, I've been looking for you.

582
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,012
You stay the hell away from me!

583
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,974
Tom! Excuse me.
I need to speak with you.

584
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,102
- What's wrong?
- It's urgent. It's about Keane.

585
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,854
Well, let's go inside.

586
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:16,875
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- We have to get Burke outta there.

587
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,919
Keane has been in on this
the entire time.

588
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:22,088
Wait. This has to do with it.

589
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,265
- Yeah, Tis, it's me.
- Amanda, listen.

590
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:37,312
I tracked the other point of access.
The number's 555-6799.

591
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:41,650
- 555-67?
- Vogler's house!

592
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:44,945
I'm sorry, Amanda.

593
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,991
I never wanted this.
Helen and I really did care about you.

594
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,954
No.

595
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,082
If Helen found out, it would kill her.

596
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:03,630
We have to... keep the bad parts
of our lives private.

597
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:16,101
Burke proved so resourceful that when
the others didn't take care of him...

598
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,479
...I had the Sandman transferred there.

599
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,277
- Why?
- I did it to save her life.

600
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,032
Helen got sick. She needed a liver.

601
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,534
She couldn't get one.

602
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:38,331
It didn't matter how much money I had.
The list was too long.

603
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,126
So I found a doctor.

604
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,919
Gottesman.

605
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,505
He said he could get one.

606
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,717
And once he started...

607
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:53,138
...he found you could make
a lot of money selling life.

608
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,812
We're killing criminals. Garbage.

609
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:07,068
After a while,
you stop thinking of them as humans.

610
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,994
Oh, Tom, there you are.

611
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,204
What's going on?

612
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,084
Why don't you tell her, Tom?

613
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,713
Tell her how you murdered for her.

614
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,511
Helen...

615
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,803
Hey, Burke,
the Sandman's comin' to see ya.

616
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,474
You don't have the guts
to come in this cell.

617
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,238
- What happened?
- They got Keller!

618
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,998
Jesus Christ! Secure this door!
Grab him!

619
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,505
Bring him with us. Come on!

620
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,513
Quiet!

621
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,517
Gene, secure the infirmary.

622
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:30,480
Well, well! Look who we have here?

623
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,274
Great! Now we have
all the assholes in one room.

624
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,944
You've caused us a lot of trouble,
Detective Burke.

625
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:37,403
You scum!

626
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,203
Let me do it.

627
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,207
It'll be messy,
killing an undercover officer.

628
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:53,378
Go ahead. Dust him!
Blow his fuckin' head off!

629
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,103
Come on, stop playin' around!
Let's get the hell outta here.

630
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,120
Why did you do it?

631
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,540
I don't know.

632
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,751
Maybe I'm goin' soft in my old age.

633
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,505
Let's just say I owe somebody somethin'.

634
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,873
- Let's get outta here.
- Let's cut through the kitchen.

635
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,150
Quick! The elevator to the kitchen!

636
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,871
Oh, God...

637
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:56,334
You're just in time for surgery, Doc.

638
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,550
OK, let's do it.

639
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,911
- Easy.
- Thanks.

640
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:43,256
- It's going to hurt now, OK?
- Yeah, stop yakking at me.

641
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,217
It's secure. We're OK for a while.

642
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:48,511
Watch it, watch it!

643
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,016
Can you make it?

644
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:58,896
- I don't think so.
- He's better off here.

645
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,109
I have to get to the outside.

646
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:06,904
I'll be back for you.

647
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,241
Just hang on.

648
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:17,165
Go with him, man.
Make sure he gets to the outside.

649
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,125
Go on! Go on!

650
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,935
I know you're in here, Burke.

651
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:42,940
You know why?

652
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,694
'Cause I can smell the nigger.

653
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,153
Kiss your black ass goodbye.

654
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,534
Go fuck yourself, you pudgy bastard.

655
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,222
I knew you needed me, brother.

656
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,435
You make a deal with the Priest,
it's for keeps.

657
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,245
Burke! Hey, Burke!

658
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,373
- Hawkins?
- He's OK.

659
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,209
You need me more than he does.
Follow me.

660
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:29,630
We have to take the catwalk
through the boiler room.

661
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,841
That's the only way to get out
to the yard.

662
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,072
Come on, Burke!
Come to Papa!

663
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,366
Priest...

664
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:13,007
I'm up here, Burke!
If you leave, Hawkins dies!

665
01:15:56,593 --> 01:16:00,596
Come on!

666
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,023
You like that, Burke?

667
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,994
This is the part I love.

668
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:10,411
Move, move!

669
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,378
Wakey, wakey, Burke!

670
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,799
Time to bleed!

671
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:30,866
Come on!

672
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,127
Welcome to hell!

673
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,916
Burke!

674
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,804
Sandman! Sandman! Sandman! Sandman!

675
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:18,515
Sandman! Sandman! Sandman!

676
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,561
Can't kill me, Burke.

677
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,522
I'm the Sandman.

678
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,981
Open up, man. Let him out.
Let him out.

679
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:01,326
He did it. He really did.
He dusted him.

680
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:06,457
Open up, man. Open up.
He just kicked in the Sandman.

681
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,133
Back up, vato.

682
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,887
Clear it out back there.

683
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,765
You got it.

684
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,048
Burke!

685
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,890
This is Hawkins.
He saved my life.

686
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:09,728
I had to, Burke.
I took a life, I gave one back.

687
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,064
Maybe now I'm even.

688
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:17,319
You just watch your ass, 72689.
I won't be there the next time.
