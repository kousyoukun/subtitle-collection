2
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,830
I think he's inside.
I'm gonna check it out.

3
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,131
<i>Burke, wait for backup. </i>

4
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:21,001
He killed my partner.

5
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,006
I'm not waiting.

6
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,508
<i>Listen, Burke, </i>
<i>this is L.A., not Canada. </i>

7
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:29,104
<i>We have procedures here. </i>
<i>You can't handle this alone. </i>

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,710
What's the problem?

9
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,582
Hey, man, what you doing here?

10
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:37,848
I'm busy. Scram.

11
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:40,015
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson in manners.

12
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,758
I'm gonna get you, man!

13
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,024
Like I said, I'm going in.

14
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,308
Time to go to sleep...

15
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:51,219
and join your old partner.

16
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,654
I'm the Sandman.
You can't stop me.

17
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,472
You're under arrest.

18
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,002
Detective Burke.
Have a seat.

19
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,312
Tom Vogler, attorney general.

20
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:26,714
On my right is Ben Keane,
on your left is Sam Waldon.

21
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:30,083
I represent the governor.
I'm heading his task force on prisons.

22
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,816
I'm with State Board of Corrections.

23
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,825
- And who are you?
- Amanda Beckett.

24
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:39,420
- She works for me.
- Detective Burke.

25
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,864
Specialized in undercover work with
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police...

26
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:45,198
stationed in Quebec.

27
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,204
You followed Christian Naylor,
"the Sandman," to L.A.

28
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:52,699
We've had some problems in one of
our prisons... Harrison Penitentiary.

29
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:55,245
It's a local piece,
small-town news.

30
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:58,205
The assistant warden was murdered.

31
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,614
Now a guard's intimated...

32
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:03,313
that it might be linked
to the deaths of some prisoners...

33
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,117
nine in the last few months.

34
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,057
We've got a gubernatorial election
coming up this fall.

35
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:12,324
Prisons are already an issue. We don't
want this to become a part of it.

36
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:16,128
The governor's put me in charge
of rectifying this little mishap.

37
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,366
We wanna send you undercover
into Harrison as a prisoner.

38
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:27,837
You're from Quebec.
No one in jail will recognize you.

39
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,210
Only this committee
will know you're an officer.

40
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,306
You'll be sentenced to Harrison
for armed robbery.

41
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:35,045
Armed robbery is
a respectable crime among inmates.

42
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,246
It's implicitly violent.

43
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:39,084
They respect violence.

44
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:41,352
We're also assigning
a partner of sorts.

45
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,758
Amanda will act as your liaison.

46
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:47,423
She'll be posing as your wife.
Amanda will relay information.

47
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,865
Through her, we'll be able
to closely monitor the operation.

48
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:57,470
Well, Detective, what do you say?

49
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:04,213
I'll let you know.

50
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:11,649
Would like me to file the papers
for you first thing in the morning?

51
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:14,954
I think the sooner, the better.
I know you always do a good job.

52
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,085
- We'll see you tomorrow night then?
- Yeah.

53
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,095
Have Helen call me
if she wants me to bring anything.

54
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,324
- I will.
- Bye.

55
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,333
A pleasure meeting you, Mr. Burke.

56
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:27,670
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.

57
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,798
He's really been like a father to me.

58
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,399
I've been working for him
ever since I graduated law school.

59
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,604
When was that?

60
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,271
Last year.

61
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:42,118
Is there a problem, Detective Burke?

62
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,485
You don't have enough experience
to be on this case.

63
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,051
Let's get something straight here.

64
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,786
I'm no girl Friday.

65
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,889
I graduated top in my class
at Stanford.

66
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,901
If you're uncomfortable with the fact
that I'm a woman...

67
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,403
then that's your problem, not mine.

68
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,234
Okay.

69
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:06,538
Check the files of any serial killers
at Harrison Prison.

70
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,408
Then you'll take the case?

71
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:11,982
I'll see you Tuesday.

72
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:15,652
I'll get to work.

73
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,186
You're getting wet.

74
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,625
Listen up!

75
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,466
Clasp your fingers in front of you.

76
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,435
And don't move.

77
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,977
I am Sergeant DeGraf.

78
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:57,484
I decide when you eat...

79
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,614
when you shower...

80
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,885
when you have visitors.

81
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,894
You are fish.

82
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:06,554
New arrivals.

83
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,960
People will try to hurt you...

84
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:13,628
rob you...

85
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,799
even rape you.

86
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,363
He said, don't move.

87
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,599
Very good.

88
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,233
It's important...

89
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,640
that you obey my rules...

90
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:08,954
rules to make the difference
between your life and your death.

91
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,422
I'm Dr. Gottesman.
Any communicable diseases?

92
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,092
Not yet.

93
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:20,929
Excuse me?

94
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,898
You're Burke, right?

95
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:30,373
You have AB negative blood.
That's very rare.

96
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,973
Okay, take it into
the next room, please.

97
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,984
Come on. Move it.

98
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:45,159
Your identification number's 72688.

99
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,959
Memorize your number... 72688.

100
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:51,399
This is your identification card,
Mr. 72688.

101
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,961
Your new home is C level,
cell C-71.

102
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,337
Next.

103
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,339
- It's dead.
- Excuse me?

104
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,679
The eye.
You were looking at it.

105
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:09,219
It's dead.
Got stabbed in it.

106
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,548
In the eye?

107
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:15,754
Yeah, I got stabbed in the eye.

108
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,391
Okay, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

109
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:24,161
Meal shift starts
every morning at 6:10.

110
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:27,671
Lunch is noon straight up.
Dinner is at 6:30 p.m.

111
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:31,139
You can take a shower once a day,
check yourself for fungus and body lice.

112
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,903
Any questions?

113
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:36,071
Your identification number is 72689.

114
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,615
Memorize your number... 72689.

115
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:41,776
72689. Right.
My name is Burke.

116
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,015
Here's your I.D. card, Mr. 72689.

117
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,855
Your new home is C level.
Cell C-68. Next.

118
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:57,262
Okay, you got your towel,
you got your toothbrush.

119
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,416
What are you doin' here?
And what do you think you're lookin' at?

120
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:53,580
I'm new here.

121
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:56,251
I don't care what you are.
You think you can sleep here?

122
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,524
Real estate.
Cost you $500.

123
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,627
Don't have any money.

124
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:08,365
You don't have any money?
Well, that's okay.

125
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:13,334
- You can punk.
- Excuse me?

126
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,709
You can get down
on your hands and knees...

127
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:22,479
and you pay,
just like any other cherry.

128
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:27,086
I don't think so.

129
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:28,682
You don't think so?

130
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,556
Possibly...

131
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,190
you might wanna reconsider.

132
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,565
I don't pay, I don't punk.

133
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,771
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

134
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,676
I was jerking you around.
Don't have a hair ball about it.

135
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:53,183
- You want the top bunk, take it.
- The bottom would be nice.

136
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,514
- Better yet. You got it.
- Thanks.

137
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,631
72689, remember?

138
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,337
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
Don't eat that.

139
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,512
What's wrong with my food?

140
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:27,780
Hey, nigger.

141
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:30,479
Are you talkin' about me, <i>ese? </i>

142
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:34,418
We keep to ourselves now.

143
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:37,051
- We don't give a shit about you people.
- Oh, yeah?

144
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,220
- Hey, listen.
- Hey, it's on me!

145
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:41,924
- Let him go. Let him go.
- It's cool, <i>ese. </i>

146
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,401
You're dead, <i>ese! </i>

147
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,904
You're fuckin' dead, <i>ese! </i>

148
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,711
You're dead!

149
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:03,085
Let me go, homes.

150
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,440
I'll talk to you later.

151
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,278
Hawkins.

152
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:37,446
I know... always the nigger's fault.

153
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:48,056
You're not gonna last too long.

154
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,028
Is that a threat?

155
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,534
No.

156
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,963
That's a promise.

157
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:05,948
It never happened!

158
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,608
Back to dinner!

159
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,021
You're a <i>rata, ese. </i>
Fuckin' dead.

160
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:36,674
What's the matter with you?

161
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,307
Can't you see this is a black table?

162
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,380
Stick with your own kind.
Trust no one.

163
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:48,220
What about you?

164
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:53,190
What about me?
You don't know who I am.

165
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:56,659
You don't know anything.

166
00:18:58,035 --> 00:18:59,627
Hey, fish.

167
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,600
Why don't you sit with us, fish?

168
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,661
Sit down, bright boy.

169
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:34,395
- So what are you in for?
- I was a bad boy.

170
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,404
And you?

171
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:41,877
Me and Keel here,
we got the big bitch.

172
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,378
Habitual.

173
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,341
See these?

174
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,421
Those are the people he's killed.

175
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,550
That's very special.

176
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,127
Lock 'em up, Dick.

177
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,475
Begin count.

178
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,741
Tier 2-C, 69.

179
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,417
Tier 2-C, 68.

180
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,665
Pruno.

181
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:40,227
Make it ourselves.

182
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,890
It's good for what ails you.

183
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:06,627
I saw you helpin' out
that nigger Hawkins.

184
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:09,495
Not good.
It's bad mojo.

185
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:12,364
Most of the time, you can't even
trust your own kind in this place.

186
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,871
Hey, Konefke.

187
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:27,683
How long have you been here?

188
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,585
Maybe six years.

189
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:41,787
I hear a lot of guys are dying.

190
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:52,166
Yeah, maybe.

191
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:55,336
But I don't see so well no more.

192
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,947
Like one of those monkeys
you hear about.

193
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:04,014
Hear no evil, see no evil.

194
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:37,250
Hi, Louis.

195
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:39,255
That's a nice outfit.

196
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,814
Thank you.

197
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:43,826
Are you trying to get me killed?

198
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:46,727
You're supposed to be my wife,
not a princess.

199
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:49,260
I didn't realize.

200
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,259
Pay attention next time.

201
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:01,300
I ran your M.O. check
on serial killers here.

202
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:06,942
Nothing matches up.
I checked all the death certificates.

203
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,884
All the victims died of puncture wounds
to the back of the skull.

204
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:14,385
Maybe it's a serial killer,
but I'm thinking maybe it's gangs...

205
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,222
or, like, ritual killings.

206
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,524
Let's concentrate on the big tips.

207
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,628
Last one was Alvin Barrett.

208
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:28,393
His cell mate, I'll talk to him.

209
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,497
You did good.

210
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,607
Thanks.

211
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,846
I need you to give me some money.

212
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:41,509
I'll have the office credit
your prison account this afternoon.

213
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:45,612
That's no good. I need real cash
to get anything done here.

214
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,157
Inmates aren't allowed to have cash.

215
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:52,218
You'll find a way
to bring me the money easy.

216
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,021
I don't know if I can do that.

217
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,296
This is my life we're talking about.

218
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:08,306
I'll get you the money.

219
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:19,479
Tell the kids Daddy loves them.

220
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,587
I'm telling you,
I won't condone it.

221
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:33,363
If you won't authorize the money,
I'll give it to him myself.

222
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,670
Don't play games with me,
Miss Beckett.

223
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:40,910
You are a liaison on this case
and nothing more.

224
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:42,274
Take it easy.

225
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,444
Don't let him get to you.

226
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,124
Another one of your lovely peers?

227
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:59,153
Hi, Helen.

228
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:01,891
Thank you, Rosarita.
I'll do it.

229
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:06,959
I stopped asking Tom about
these investigations years ago.

230
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:09,369
It's all so sordid anyway.

231
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:12,875
- I thought politics interested you.
- No, not anymore.

232
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:17,277
Since I got out of the hospital,
things have taken on a new perspective.

233
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:35,826
Remember me?

234
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:45,073
I want you to meet my homey.
Bruce!

235
00:25:48,545 --> 00:25:52,447
He likes to kick the shit
out of white trash like you, boy.

236
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,810
So what you gonna do? Huh?

237
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:11,351
Where'd you get all those books?

238
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:13,362
My wife.
We like to read a lot.

239
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,129
Shit. The only thing I read
is girly magazine letters.

240
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,794
Get back.

241
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,006
Listen to this one.

242
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:27,373
"Dear Sirs.

243
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:32,040
I never thought this would happen to me,
but I was workin' the late shift...

244
00:27:32,115 --> 00:27:35,050
when this big-titted mama
comes up to me."

245
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:42,013
You think any of this stuff
ever really happens?

246
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:44,151
- Don't know.
- Never happened to me.

247
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:31,306
Hawkins... you know him?

248
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:35,538
Thanks.

249
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:37,705
Hello, guys.
You miss me?

250
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,578
It's the Lone Ranger.

251
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:43,346
Hi-ho, Silver.
What's up, Kimosabe?

252
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:47,747
The man just waltzes
right on in here...

253
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:51,089
visits with the happy, old negros.

254
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,332
You're Lobo, Burke.
You know that.

255
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,958
- I'm Lobo?
- Yep.

256
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:03,665
You know how wolves stake out
their territory pissin' on things?

257
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,072
I figure you pissed on
just about everything around here.

258
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:11,040
- You know everything, right?
- Been here a long time.

259
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:13,241
What are you in for?

260
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,181
Murder.

261
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,380
Let me guess.

262
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,021
You're innocent, right?

263
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,158
I choked the son of a bitch
just as sure as I'm sittin' here.

264
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:33,225
Been here over ten years.
That's a long time...

265
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:36,534
to be rollin' smokes
and countin' cockroaches.

266
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,373
What's that?

267
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:42,377
Makin' shot for zip guns.

268
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,844
Scary times. People gettin'
spiked in the head and shit.

269
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:54,046
Gotta learn to defend yourself...

270
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,490
- So you don't get dusted.
- I heard that, man.

271
00:29:57,794 --> 00:30:02,094
You probably figure I owe you something
'cause of what you did the other day.

272
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:07,999
Barrett... who killed him?
He was my friend.

273
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,998
Let me tell you something.
I don't owe you jack shit.

274
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:20,444
You wanna know what happened
to your friend? See the Priest.

275
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:21,916
The Priest?

276
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:25,445
That's all I'm sayin'.

277
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:31,556
<i>I'm tellin'you, the lower you go, </i>
<i>the funkier it gets in this place. </i>

278
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:34,096
Down where we're goin',
the guards won't even come down here.

279
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:36,223
This guy I'm gonna introduce you to...

280
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,824
Priest, man.
He's part fuckin' snake.

281
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:40,836
I know you think I'm shittin' you,
but I'm not.

282
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:43,270
Wait till you see his eyes.
Don't look at 'em too long.

283
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:45,603
It gives me the fuckin' creeps.

284
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:49,634
You gotta cover your ass down here,
and I mean that literally.

285
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:54,149
It's gonna blow your mind, man.

286
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,151
You gotta see this.

287
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:26,214
What?

288
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:38,051
What are you talkin' about?

289
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,756
- Look, that's not the deal we made.
- Priest...

290
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,821
Listen! Look.

291
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:46,995
I want my stuff now.

292
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:50,796
Like I started saying before...

293
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:54,105
Priest, this is Burke.

294
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,974
Yeah.

295
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:59,503
I heard you went airborne on Perez.

296
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:02,708
You want a lady?

297
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:08,714
He thinks he's too good for me.

298
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,783
What's wrong with my ladies?

299
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:13,886
Nothing.

300
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:16,454
I just need some help.

301
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:32,640
I help lots of people.

302
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,843
I get Jersey hormone pills.

303
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,581
Is that the kind of help you want?

304
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:41,249
Alvin Barrett... who killed him?

305
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:44,725
Someone punched a hole in his head.

306
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:46,785
Why?

307
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:49,058
I can't just tell you these things.

308
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:52,499
I give you a little,
you taste it.

309
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,833
That's how things work.

310
00:32:56,739 --> 00:33:01,176
You could talk to Myerson,
Barrett's former cell mate.

311
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:03,235
He's in solitary now...

312
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:07,306
but he works in the infirmary,
night shift.

313
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:11,217
He can fill prescriptions
if you got the money.

314
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,556
Sure you don't wanna sample my goods?

315
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:18,616
I'll take a rain check.

316
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,468
Got another one.

317
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:35,977
He won't be home for dinner.

318
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:43,785
- What is this?
- Goddamn medical waste.

319
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:53,625
Medical waste.

320
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:06,103
- You Myerson?
- What do you want?

321
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:09,408
I need some medicine.

322
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:11,811
I got prescription drugs...
morphine and uppers. What do you need?

323
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:14,816
I hear you were Barrett's cell mate.
He was a good kid, huh?

324
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:17,250
- He's dead now.
- Yeah.

325
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,756
On drugs. Bad news.

326
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:22,654
No way.

327
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,659
He was as green as grass.
He never did nothin'.

328
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,854
Convenience store robbery,
and that's it.

329
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,954
Maybe he was in a gang then.

330
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:31,933
I said he was clean.
What are you so curious about?

331
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:37,968
He was my friend
who got spiked in the head.

332
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,599
Maybe you know who did it.

333
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:45,478
- I'm not saying another word.
- Yes, you are.

334
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:46,947
Hey, fuck you!

335
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,614
What is this?

336
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,247
It's soda pop.

337
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:57,453
You're gonna drink this.

338
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:00,690
Please, man, don't!
I didn't do nothing! Christ!

339
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:04,324
Look, they'll kill me if I talk.
A guard let 'em in, not me.

340
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,493
Lockup, five minutes.
Move it!

341
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:11,572
I'll talk to you.

342
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,847
- Hello?
- <i>It's Burke. </i>

343
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:27,514
<i>I've got something. </i>

344
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:31,687
Hang on a second.

345
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:33,251
<i>Okay, I'm ready. </i>

346
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,593
Barrett's cell mate is scared.

347
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:38,190
Whatever's going on,
the guards are involved.

348
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:40,963
<i>I need to see the victims'files. </i>

349
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:42,937
The files haven't been transferred
to computer yet.

350
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,939
Harrison's files
are all still at the prison.

351
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,837
What are you doing?

352
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:52,778
Right now?

353
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:56,376
Eating dinner.

354
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:08,861
Is there anything else?

355
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,762
<i>I'll be in touch. </i>

356
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,644
Have a nice little chat?

357
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:29,543
I need the key to the records room.

358
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,382
That can be arranged.

359
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:43,723
- Hey!
- What?

360
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:47,801
What do you got here?

361
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,668
A load of shirts
for the reception desk.

362
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:06,285
Okay, you got me.

363
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:09,882
I was takin' some pruno
over to the guys in storage.

364
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,984
Now, you know I'm gonna have
to take that.

365
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:13,494
Sure.

366
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,427
You ever actually taste that stuff?

367
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:21,301
- I don't think so.
- All right.

368
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,430
Well, maybe.
Let me try some.

369
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:57,764
Oh, man!

370
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,774
Well, you're gonna have to develop
a taste for it.

371
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,867
You just can't go
wading into the shit, you know.

372
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:21,152
New arrival.

373
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,341
- What was that?
- What was what?

374
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:12,311
I must be going crazy.

375
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,559
Lot of old ghosts
hangin' around this place.

376
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:29,697
Let's get out of here.

377
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:40,840
Only the murder victims
have the "SL" notation.

378
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,243
The victims are brand-new...
no drugs, no gangs.

379
00:39:45,514 --> 00:39:47,573
All different ages and race.

380
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:52,010
I can check with the mainframe system.

381
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:55,649
Maybe "SL" is some sort of
departmental abbreviation.

382
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,716
I've got the guy for you.

383
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,159
I've worked with him before.
He's a real pro.

384
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:02,629
He'll do the hacking for you.

385
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,265
And don't tell Keane about this, okay?

386
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:18,137
You know this is illegal,
don't you?

387
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:22,150
Sort of illegal.
Do you mind?

388
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:25,547
Are you kidding?
I love it.

389
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:28,181
See, I like to think of myself
as a renegade.

390
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:30,657
You know, like a cowboy.

391
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:34,526
Yeah, I'm a computer cowboy.
That's what I am.

392
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:49,501
- Well?
- Well, what? It's checking.

393
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:52,672
"SL" can stand
for virtually anything...

394
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:54,682
or nothing at all.

395
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,681
So, you got a boyfriend or something?

396
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:08,619
The computer looks for combinations
of words beginning with "SL."

397
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:11,997
Then it sees if there are
any files in the system named that.

398
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,868
Shit. I'm missing <i>Star Trek. </i>

399
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:17,872
You wanna watch <i>Star Trek? </i>

400
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,274
All right. So...

401
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,408
We got something here.

402
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:30,251
Now we see where the files
are most commonly accessed from.

403
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,456
- Bingo!
- That's it. That's the file.

404
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:41,521
Shit! We need the password.

405
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:45,099
That's okay.
It's a start.

406
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:48,932
Give me a day or two...

407
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:51,768
and I can locate any terminals
it's been accessed from.

408
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:53,866
You'll find out whose file it was.

409
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:58,077
Great. I'll take you home.
Your parents'll kill me.

410
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:02,979
Who needs parents?
We're both adults.

411
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:04,815
Aren't we?

412
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:08,782
I'm an adult...

413
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,553
and you're a kid.

414
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:13,288
Your hormones are workin' overtime.

415
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,796
Come on.
I'll take you home.

416
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:22,899
I'd rather not tell Keane about
what I'm doing with the computers.

417
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:26,874
Burke thinks we can get it done
a lot quicker without his interference.

418
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:30,139
I wonder if Detective Burke isn't
interfering with your work habits.

419
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,146
We have procedures for a reason.

420
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,214
I know what I'm doing.

421
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:36,979
I hope you do.

422
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:40,044
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.

423
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,714
Don't worry.

424
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,595
Damn it!
It took you long enough.

425
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:01,536
You want to talk now?

426
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,740
Look, I found out some things...
about what they did to Barrett.

427
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,976
He didn't deserve
what they did to him.

428
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:12,348
We used to smuggle out
some drugs from overstock.

429
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:15,254
Well, I was in surgery last night...

430
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:17,588
Shit. That's...

431
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:21,653
If he finds his keys missing,
I'm a dead man.

432
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,789
Relax.

433
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:25,060
Don't worry.

434
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:27,860
I need protection.

435
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:30,872
Another guy got spiked last night,
and this is serious shit!

436
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,033
Quiet.

437
00:43:33,108 --> 00:43:35,133
I've got to get this key
back to Priest.

438
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,851
Protection.

439
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:45,716
I need protection.

440
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:01,895
Lady-killer.

441
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:04,337
Just thought you'd like to know...

442
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:07,034
I think somebody's
gonna pay you a visit tonight.

443
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:09,009
I'd think twice about sleeping.

444
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:13,505
Thanks.

445
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:16,346
I just hate to see
a good man go to waste.

446
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:29,727
I finally figured out the password.

447
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:32,733
I've had the computer running
word variations for hours.

448
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:35,929
Of course, you know, it was
a special program I devised myself.

449
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:41,905
You know, I was reading
this article in a men's magazine...

450
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:45,708
about the virility of men
in their middle to late teens...

451
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:47,612
- Right.
- Just do it.

452
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:49,742
Right. Here we go.

453
00:44:53,522 --> 00:44:55,422
Morpheus was the Greek god of sleep.

454
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:57,425
I'm a whiz at mythology.

455
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:59,620
Criminals have a sense of humor.

456
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:03,755
Yes! We're in.

457
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:06,027
You're kidding me?

458
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:09,502
No. Is there anything else you need?

459
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:12,301
Print it out.
Can you make a copy of this file?

460
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,399
- Sure I can.
- Great.

461
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:19,574
What the hell is it doing?

462
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:21,775
Someone is destroying it
from the other end.

463
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,148
- Well, stop it.
- I can't.

464
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:26,847
We just have to hope
it started the print copy first.

465
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:45,736
Where's this file accessed from?

466
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:49,141
The infirmary, for one.
I checked up on the other abbreviation.

467
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:52,180
"H-L-E" is a coding system
for a tissue type.

468
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:54,909
I'm still checking on
that other point of access.

469
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:57,009
It's definitely someone
outside the prison.

470
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,754
That's our key player.

471
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:03,722
This is my beeper number.
Call me as soon as you find it out.

472
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:06,090
Tisdale, you are a stud.

473
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:19,865
All the Sleep file contained was
a list of prisoner I.D. numbers...

474
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:22,911
strung together along with
the prisoners' blood types.

475
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:25,503
Every person who was on that list
has been killed.

476
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,744
- It's a hit list.
- <i>Exactly. </i>

477
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:31,081
<i>Each victim had a physical</i>
<i>days before they were killed. </i>

478
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:33,348
Each one came up clean.

479
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:36,016
No diseases, no drug addiction,
nothing.

480
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:40,551
I think someone from the outside
is working with the guards.

481
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:45,929
Keane would have access to the files.

482
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,831
There's something else.

483
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:56,538
Your number's next on the list.

484
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:41,622
What's going on in here?

485
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,624
Help me.

486
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,450
- Grab him.
- Help me!

487
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:25,099
What are you doing in my prison?

488
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,137
Is something wrong with your mouth?

489
00:48:47,823 --> 00:48:49,290
You killed Konefke.

490
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:54,018
I didn't do it.

491
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:57,395
I know.

492
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:09,268
Strip him.

493
00:49:12,981 --> 00:49:15,677
<i>When I know you</i>

494
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:20,412
<i>When I know you</i>

495
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:23,287
<i>When I know you like I know</i>

496
00:49:30,732 --> 00:49:32,666
You got a big mouth, Jersey.

497
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:39,470
I didn't say no names.

498
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:44,572
I didn't say you.

499
00:50:25,454 --> 00:50:26,785
Who's there?

500
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:31,716
What's going on?
What do you want?

501
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:34,591
We wanna talk, just like Burke.

502
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,997
I didn't talk to Burke.
I didn't say nothing.

503
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:40,296
Who said I talked to Burke?
This is bullshit.

504
00:50:41,803 --> 00:50:43,168
What is that?

505
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:48,774
Shit. Oh, God.

506
00:50:48,844 --> 00:50:50,971
Hey, wait a minute.
You can't do this.

507
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:54,277
You gotta hear my side of it.
Somebody's lyin', man!

508
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,579
Somebody's fuckin' lying on me!

509
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:59,587
You can't do this, man!

510
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:02,021
Oh, God. Just stop.
Wait a minute.

511
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,684
Just wait one second!
Oh, God.

512
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,955
What did you say to Burke?

513
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:09,088
Who said I talked?
How did you find that out?

514
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:10,825
That's bullshit, man!

515
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:16,635
I swear to God I didn't talk!
Stop it! What are you doin'?

516
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:19,265
You're crazy, man!
People will find out!

517
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:21,309
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?

518
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:24,539
I'll give you anything!
What do you want?

519
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:27,376
You're a liar, Myerson.

520
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,939
Don't! Please!

521
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:57,369
This is ridiculous.

522
00:52:00,749 --> 00:52:02,808
Do you wanna see your husband?

523
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:06,114
The purse.

524
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:08,713
Then bring in a female guard.

525
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,815
None seem to be available.

526
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:16,263
Up with the arms.

527
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:32,705
I don't know.

528
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:37,209
I'm sorry, missy...

529
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:39,947
but you're gonna have
to remove your clothes.

530
00:52:43,091 --> 00:52:45,685
Your husband is waiting.

531
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:20,854
Clean up and get dressed.

532
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,897
Your pretty little wife
wants to see you.

533
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,810
You have a half hour, Burke.

534
00:53:44,886 --> 00:53:47,047
Have a good time there, buddy.

535
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:05,501
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

536
00:54:07,642 --> 00:54:09,803
- Who did this to you?
- The guards.

537
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:12,472
They let two prisoners into my cell.

538
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,811
One of them had an ice pick.

539
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:17,317
At least we know
who's been spiking people.

540
00:54:20,422 --> 00:54:22,014
What about you?

541
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:26,359
Nothing.

542
00:54:35,904 --> 00:54:37,997
You look like hell.

543
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:41,233
So do you.

544
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:55,955
I checked on Dr. Gottesman, and...

545
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,122
And?

546
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:03,824
He didn't get into med school here.

547
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:06,599
He went to South America.

548
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:08,260
South America?

549
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:13,507
- And, um...
- And?

550
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:18,638
There were a couple...

551
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:20,305
of, um...

552
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,445
malpractice suits.

553
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:38,966
You're so beautiful.

554
00:56:11,866 --> 00:56:15,358
You guys are all spooked 'cause
you think there's some big conspiracy.

555
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:17,997
Priest, you know as well as I
what's going on.

556
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:21,573
Brother got his brains scrambled
just last night.

557
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:24,703
Straight through the skull
like a piece of meat.

558
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,940
It could be me next,
could be you.

559
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:29,916
So big, white Superman's
gonna save our asses?

560
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,419
What makes you think
we wanna be saved?

561
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:34,614
Burke needs our help.

562
00:56:34,689 --> 00:56:36,623
He needs a distraction.

563
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:49,528
- Good work, Hawkins.
- Thank the Priest.

564
00:56:49,604 --> 00:56:51,663
- Shit!
- Yeah, it's locked.

565
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,140
They cart this medical waste
in and out of here day and night.

566
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:55,574
- Where?
- I don't know.

567
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:58,272
They got a special pickup for it.
It's hazardous.

568
00:56:58,346 --> 00:57:00,337
Oh, yeah?

569
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,576
Let's see what's inside.
Watch your eye.

570
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:04,346
Funny. Hurry up.

571
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:26,196
Hold this.

572
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:32,337
It's a human heart.

573
00:57:32,414 --> 00:57:35,144
Oh, God.

574
00:57:40,555 --> 00:57:41,852
What's going on?

575
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:43,857
New dude being brought in.

576
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:45,859
All this for a new fish?

577
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:49,294
Man, this ain't no fish.
This is the man.

578
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:17,875
Long time no see, Burke.

579
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:29,261
Would you like to know
what's out there, Burke?

580
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:33,431
Would you like to know
what's on the other side?

581
00:59:37,338 --> 00:59:39,863
You know what prisoners hate
more than anything else, Burke?

582
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:46,837
Prisoners hate cops
more than anything else.

583
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:48,507
Fucking pigs!

584
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:53,584
Every killer in this prison...

585
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,589
is gonna know who you are.

586
00:59:57,091 --> 01:00:00,254
And you're not gonna know
when it's coming.

587
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,532
Let him go.

588
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:25,311
Bring me a dream, Burke.

589
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:28,755
Bring me a dream.

590
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:56,578
Hey, you belong to me!

591
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:59,916
He's a cop!
The only good cop...

592
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:11,994
I'm gonna rip your eyes out!

593
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:14,057
Get me some chitlins.

594
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,004
I gotta get outta here!

595
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:20,404
Get me out of this pen!

596
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:22,409
You pig!

597
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:36,112
That's a load of shit you were
giving us. Barrett wasn't your friend.

598
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:40,554
I'm trying to stop
what's going on here.

599
01:01:40,628 --> 01:01:42,562
Doesn't that make a difference?

600
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,997
In the cage, man,
a cop is worse than a...

601
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:48,001
baby raper.

602
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,465
Why are you still here?

603
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:53,473
You're a dead man.

604
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,844
I need your help.

605
01:02:01,015 --> 01:02:02,949
It's too late.

606
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:44,457
Miss Beckett,
I've been looking for you.

607
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,857
You stay the hell away from me.

608
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:50,125
Tom. Excuse me.
I need to speak with you.

609
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:52,063
- What's wrong?
- It's urgent.

610
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:53,725
It's about Keane.

611
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:55,735
Let's go inside.

612
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,181
Now, you want to tell me
what's going on?

613
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,189
We have to get Burke out of there.

614
01:03:16,257 --> 01:03:18,919
Keane has been in on this
the entire time.

615
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:21,461
Wait. This has to do with it.

616
01:03:28,803 --> 01:03:31,567
- Yeah, Tis, it's me.
- <i>Amanda, listen. </i>

617
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:36,508
<i>I tried the other point of access. </i>
<i>The number's 555-6799.</i>

618
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:41,473
<i>Vogler's house! </i>

619
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:46,580
I'm sorry, Amanda.
I never wanted this.

620
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:49,122
Helen and I
really did care about you.

621
01:03:54,629 --> 01:03:56,290
If Helen found out,
it would kill her.

622
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:00,828
We have to...

623
01:04:00,902 --> 01:04:02,836
keep the bad parts
of our lives private.

624
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:13,241
Burke proved so resourceful...

625
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:16,511
that when the others
didn't take care of him...

626
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:18,677
I had the Sandman transferred there.

627
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:22,583
Why?

628
01:04:22,657 --> 01:04:25,023
I did it to save her life.

629
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:30,289
Helen got sick.
She needed a liver.

630
01:04:30,364 --> 01:04:32,798
She couldn't get one.

631
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:35,529
It didn't matter
how much money I had.

632
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:37,537
The list was too long.

633
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:40,407
So I found a doctor.

634
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:46,238
He said he could get one.

635
01:04:46,314 --> 01:04:48,748
Once he started...

636
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:52,308
he found you could make
a lot of money selling life.

637
01:04:57,191 --> 01:04:59,125
We're killing criminals.

638
01:04:59,193 --> 01:05:00,785
Garbage.

639
01:05:02,029 --> 01:05:04,122
And after a while...

640
01:05:04,198 --> 01:05:06,632
you stop thinking of them as humans.

641
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,168
Oh, Tom, there you are.

642
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,402
What's going on?

643
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:22,612
Why don't you tell her, Tom?

644
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:26,150
Tell her how you murdered for her.

645
01:06:10,264 --> 01:06:14,633
Hey, Burke,
Sandman's comin' to see ya.

646
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:18,669
You don't have the guts
to come in this cell.

647
01:06:26,948 --> 01:06:28,108
What happened?

648
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:31,843
- What happened?
- He got Keller!

649
01:08:03,477 --> 01:08:06,412
Jesus Christ!
Secure this door! Grab him!

650
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:12,852
Bring him too. Come on.

651
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,394
Gene, secure the infirmary.

652
01:08:25,466 --> 01:08:29,766
Well, well,
look who we have here.

653
01:08:29,837 --> 01:08:32,567
Great. Now we have
all the assholes in one room.

654
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,131
You've caused us a great deal
of trouble, Detective Burke.

655
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:36,608
You scum.

656
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,612
Let me do it.

657
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:48,484
It's gonna be messy if you
kill an undercover officer.

658
01:08:48,556 --> 01:08:50,319
Go ahead, dust him.

659
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:52,552
Blow his fuckin' head off!

660
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:10,340
Come on! Stop playin' around!
Let's get the hell out of here!

661
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,559
Why did you do it?

662
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,623
I don't know.

663
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:33,360
Maybe I'm goin' soft
in my old age.

664
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:36,766
Let's just say
I owe somebody somethin'.

665
01:10:08,903 --> 01:10:11,337
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go through the kitchen.

666
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:38,390
Quick! The elevator to the kitchen!

667
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,568
Oh, God.

668
01:10:52,646 --> 01:10:56,275
You're just in time
for surgery, Doc.

669
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:04,123
Let's do it.

670
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,108
- Easy.
- Thanks.

671
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:40,786
It's going to hurt now, okay?

672
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:42,795
Yeah. Stop yacking at me.

673
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:45,661
It's secure.
We're okay for a while.

674
01:11:51,005 --> 01:11:52,939
Can you make it?

675
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:58,669
- I don't think so.
- He's better off here.

676
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:02,812
I have to get to the outside.

677
01:12:04,885 --> 01:12:06,819
I'll be back for you.

678
01:12:07,988 --> 01:12:09,922
Just hang on.

679
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,989
Go with him, man.
Make sure he gets to the outside.

680
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:18,998
Go on! Go on!

681
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:37,183
I know you're in here, Burke.

682
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:42,755
You know why?

683
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:46,153
'Cause I can smell the nigger.

684
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:28,493
Kiss your black ass good-bye.

685
01:13:31,071 --> 01:13:33,733
Go fuck yourself, you pudgy bastard.

686
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:55,428
I knew you needed me, brother.

687
01:13:55,496 --> 01:13:59,557
You make a deal with the Priest,
it's for keeps.

688
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:23,488
It's okay.
You need me more than he does.

689
01:14:23,557 --> 01:14:25,149
Follow me.

690
01:14:25,225 --> 01:14:29,025
We have to take the catwalk
through the boiler room.

691
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,394
That's the only way
to get out to the yard.

692
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:52,512
Come on, Burke!

693
01:14:52,586 --> 01:14:54,679
Come to Papa!

694
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:09,001
I'm up here, Burke!

695
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:11,970
If you leave, Hawkins dies!

696
01:15:55,783 --> 01:15:58,684
Come on!

697
01:16:49,937 --> 01:16:51,871
You like that, Burke?

698
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:28,199
This is the part I love.

699
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:07,231
Move, move, move!

700
01:19:59,126 --> 01:20:00,616
Wakey, wakey, Burke.

701
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:04,530
Time to bleed.

702
01:20:28,922 --> 01:20:30,753
Come on!

703
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,303
Welcome to hell!

704
01:23:01,508 --> 01:23:03,840
Can't kill me, Burke.

705
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:05,844
I'm the Sandman.

706
01:23:42,515 --> 01:23:44,949
- Let the man through.
- Let him go, man.

707
01:23:45,018 --> 01:23:48,215
- He just dusted the Sandman.
- Open up, man. Let him out.

708
01:23:54,194 --> 01:23:56,719
Let him go by.

709
01:23:56,796 --> 01:23:58,730
You did it, man.

710
01:23:58,798 --> 01:24:00,732
You really did it.
You dusted him.

711
01:24:02,068 --> 01:24:05,799
Open up, man. Open up.
He just kicked up the Sandman.

712
01:24:13,947 --> 01:24:15,972
Back up, <i>vatos. </i>

713
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:20,018
Clear it out back there.

714
01:24:20,086 --> 01:24:22,145
You got it, homes.

715
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:58,490
Easy.

716
01:25:01,328 --> 01:25:04,195
This is Hawkins.
He saved my life.

717
01:25:04,264 --> 01:25:06,198
I had to, Burke.

718
01:25:06,266 --> 01:25:09,702
I took a life.
I gave one back.

719
01:25:09,769 --> 01:25:12,101
Maybe now I'm even.

720
01:25:12,172 --> 01:25:14,902
Just watch your ass, 72689.

721
01:25:14,974 --> 01:25:16,908
I won't be there the next time.

722
01:25:17,908 --> 01:25:27,908
