3
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,625
You cheated, you know.

4
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:30,041
The Duel Arena has very clear rules.
No magic.

5
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,750
It's not cheating if you win.
It's only cheating if you get caught.

6
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,166
-Shall we go another round?
-No, we don't have time.

7
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,291
Sparring with you is
the only part of the day I enjoy anymore.

8
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,666
I enjoy it too, but we're needed.

9
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,166
It's one of the downsides of overseeing
the most important school ever built.

10
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,541
And I'm bored.

11
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,458
Rafal, what do you want?

12
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,250
Just one more round.

13
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,666
Ugh.

14
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,041
We'll both use our magic.

15
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,375
No holds barred.

16
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,250
Come on, Rhian.

17
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,708
-Show me how it's done.

18
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,750
You just don't stop--

19
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,375
Rafal, that's enough!

20
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:19,458
Maybe for you,
but I'm done settling for half.

21
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,458
I want it all!

22
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,250
No!

23
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,666
Rafal, what have you done? That's…

24
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,291
Blood magic.

25
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,041
I've been searching for years,
but last night, I finally found it.

26
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
Rafal, it's forbidden for a reason.

27
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,250
It'll consume you. You can't control it.

28
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,250
I prefer chaos.

29
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,875
Thousands of years,
you always gave the heroes the upper hand!

30
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,125
I held the balance with you.

31
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,125
It's my turn now.

32
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,500
Rafal…

33
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
I dictate the terms.

34
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,416
And it's going to be
a <i>very</i> different world.

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,833
We can work together.

36
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,791
Evil doesn't cooperate.

37
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,416
Evil doesn't share.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,875
When I'm done…

39
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
…Evil won't lose.

40
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,791
No!

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,291
Oh, Rafal.

42
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:35,333
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there lived a girl named Sophie.</i>

43
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,750
<i>A brave creature of exquisite beauty</i>
<i>and uncommon grace…</i>

44
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>…who was destined to change the world.</i>

45
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,250
Now, listen up for the last time,

46
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,916
you lazy, ridiculous girl.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,166
Get your candied ass out of bed now!

48
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,708
Sophie, I know you can hear me!

49
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,875
-Someone save me.

50
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,083
Okay, I'm awake.
Don't break the door down.

51
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
I will,
if you're not out in five minutes.

52
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:18,083
-And no spending an hour on your hair.

53
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,750
At least I have hair.

54
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,875
All right, settle down, now, boys.

55
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,791
Good morning, my dear family.

56
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,291
Hey, don't waste that tomato, Sophie!
It was supposed to go in the stew!

57
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,875
You've<i> got</i> to be kidding me.

58
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,333
<i>Meanwhile, on the other side of Gavaldon,</i>

59
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:46,458
<i>just outside of town,</i>
<i>in a humble cottage on top of Graves Hill…</i>

60
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,291
<i>…there lived a girl named Agatha.</i>

61
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,458
Dang it.

62
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,000
You're too good
at staring contests, Reaper.

63
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,958
-Come here a minute, Aggie?

64
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,958
I'm making Great-Grandma's love potion
for the widow Grunfeld.

65
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,458
It needs something.

66
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,166
-Hemlock.
-Of course.

67
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:27,083
<i>Agatha had no idea</i>
<i>if her mother was actually a witch</i>

68
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,791
<i>since her potions never worked.</i>

69
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:34,375
<i>But it was in Agatha</i>
<i>that her mother placed her highest hopes,</i>

70
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:39,750
<i>knowing that her daughter</i>
<i>had the makings of a real witch.</i>

71
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,958
<i>-A sentiment shared by Agatha's peers.</i>

72
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,125
-Witch! Witch! Witch!

73
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,208
-Burn her! Burn her!
-Witch! Witch!

74
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,500
Hello there,
my little forest friends.

75
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,083
Weirdos!

76
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,791
-Freaks!

77
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,333
God, I hate this town.

78
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,541
<i>Fortunately, they had each other.</i>

79
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,833
<i>A friendship between</i>
<i>two such different girls</i>

80
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:23,291
<i>might have seemed unlikely,</i>
<i>but theirs was a special bond…</i>

81
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,750
Oh, gross!

82
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,958
<i>…forged at an early age.</i>

83
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:32,708
<i>For it was the death of Sophie's mother,</i>
<i>the person who loved her most…</i>

84
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,458
Always remember how special you are.

85
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,125
You're gonna change the world someday.

86
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,583
Then you'll live happily ever after.

87
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,208
<i>…that brought her a friend</i>
<i>who loved her even more.</i>

88
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,250
-Who's there?
-I… I made this for you.

89
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,958
I'm sorry about your mom.

90
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,916
<i>And it was</i>
<i>beneath the village wishing tree</i>

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,500
<i>that they sealed a bond</i>
<i>they knew would last a lifetime.</i>

92
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,750
Like, for literally
the hundredth time, no.

93
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,916
-It wouldn't have to be a whole makeover.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,833
We could just do a cucumber eye mask.
Maybe a pumice scrub for your pores.

95
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,875
-Hey, ugly.

96
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
Aren't you gonna answer him?

97
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,291
Not her, you.

98
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,583
-Oh.
-Eric says you put a hex on him.

99
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,208
-Who's Eric?

100
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,791
-We've been in the same class eight years.
-He says you looked at him weird.

101
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,666
And now he's feeling all itchy.

102
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,791
I'm sorry,
that sounds more like a hygiene issue.

103
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,500
Seriously. Lice, anyone?

104
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,208
-Hey, shut up!

105
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:33,666
You two think you're better than us,
but really, you're just a prig and a pig.

106
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,625
Freaks.

107
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,875
And I'm Eric.

108
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,291
You know, I think he likes you.

109
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,666
Who, Eric?

110
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,041
I'm sorry, there's an Eric?

111
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,416
Oh, I… I need to pick up some hemlock
from Mrs. Fisher for my mom.

112
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,208
I gotta get some green fringe anyway.

113
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,166
-I'll meet you at Deauville's.
-Wait, no, Sophie, I…

114
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,541
Okay. Uh…

115
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,208
Cool.

116
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,666
Witch.

117
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,375
-She's a witch.

118
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,250
Hi.

119
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,500
Hello there, little guy.

120
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,916
-Aw, yeah, you like that?

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,958
You're the girl lives in the graveyard.

122
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,125
We live <i>by </i>the graveyard, yeah.

123
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,250
Mm.

124
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,958
You know, everyone…

125
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,875
…and I mean everyone…
says you're a witch.

126
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,583
You know what we used to do…
what we used to do to witches in Gavaldon?

127
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,833
We burned 'em.

128
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,708
-You have a really nice day, buddy.
-Whoa!

129
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:03,083
We don't want witches in this town.

130
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,958
Do you hear me?

131
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,708
It's a threat
to the decent people of Gavaldon.

132
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,458
You know, I seriously doubt
there are <i>any </i>decent people in Gavaldon.

133
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,291
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

134
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,041
Let's… Let's get out of here.

135
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,958
Hey, let's drop by Deauville's,
see if she's got anything new.

136
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,875
Oh, don't you have to get home, though?

137
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,083
C'mon. Let's see
if she's got something good.

138
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,583
Ah!

139
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,416
My favorite readers.

140
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,625
Good thing you stopped by.

141
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,500
We had a big delivery yesterday.

142
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,375
-Any ghost stories?
-Yes, a few interesting-looking ones.

143
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,500
Any new fairy tales?

144
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,083
Nothing you haven't read
a thousand times before, Sophie.

145
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,250
But I did spot some very interesting
older editions in there.

146
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,125
Look, look! Dig around.

147
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,875
Okay, this might sound crazy,

148
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,291
but you ever think about
branching out of your comfort zone?

149
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,125
Maybe, like, stop reading
little kids' books? Aww.

150
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,333
To <i>The Blood of the Homunculus</i>?

151
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,416
I'm good, thanks.

152
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,458
Give me <i>Cinderella</i> any day.

153
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,166
-Just look at the dresses in here.
-Ah.

154
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,750
You found it.

155
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,625
Just look at the embossing.

156
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,291
Who's S.G.E.?

157
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,375
Not who, what.
The School for Good and Evil.

158
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,375
Don't tell me you've never heard of it.

159
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,625
-Where is it?
-No one knows.

160
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,500
Another time, another world.

161
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,666
But legend has it,

162
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,250
it's where the true story
behind every great fairy tale begins.

163
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,583
-Ooh.
-The School for Good trains the heroes.

164
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,083
The School for Evil, the villains.

165
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,833
-Or so they say.
-The people in insane asylums, you mean.

166
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,416
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

167
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,666
Twenty years ago, a girl named Leonora
was taken from our village

168
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,875
<i>-under a blood-red sky.</i>

169
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,541
<i>Many believe the school</i>
<i>wanted her for some reason.</i>

170
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,250
-<i>What happened to her?</i>

171
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,625
-<i>No one knows.</i>

172
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,791
She was never heard from again.

173
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,875
That'd be one way to get out of this town.
Do they ever accept new students?

174
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,541
You're joking, right?

175
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah.

176
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,833
<i>Dear School for Good and Evil.</i>

177
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:39,583
<i>As a future princess, I wish very much</i>
<i>to attend your esteemed institution.</i>

178
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,333
<i>Allow me to list the many attributes</i>

179
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,291
<i>that I believe make me</i>
<i>a uniquely qualified candidate.</i>

180
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,583
<i>From a very young age,</i>

181
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,166
<i>I've always known</i>
<i>it's been my destiny to change the world.</i>

182
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,541
<i>Willing to try anything</i>
<i>to escape her current life…</i>

183
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,833
Please be real.

184
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,958
<i>…Sophie entrusted</i>
<i>all her hopes for the future</i>

185
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,666
<i>to the powers of the Wishing Tree.</i>

186
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,875
-Oh, I hate my stepmother!
-Whoa, whoa. What?

187
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,583
There's an opening at the factory,

188
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,750
so she's making me quit school
to bring in more money.

189
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,375
So I will quit too.
Can she get me a job there with you?

190
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,291
And then what?

191
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,833
We just fade into this town
like everyone else?

192
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,458
No, Aggie. My mom said
I'm supposed to do something important.

193
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,666
Something that matters.

194
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,416
So,

195
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,416
I'm leaving tonight.

196
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,583
Wait, Sophie… you've never even
set foot outside Gavaldon.

197
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,166
You don't even know what's out there.

198
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,125
-None of us really do.
-That's the point.

199
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,208
You know nothing can ever happen for me
as long as I'm stuck here.

200
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,541
I can't settle for an ordinary life.

201
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,458
I won't.

202
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,625
Hey, look.

203
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,208
-Remember?
-Oh!

204
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,083
-Yeah, I found it in my attic last week.
-Oh!

205
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,791
See? You already did
do something that matters.

206
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,375
The day you became my friend.

207
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,416
Please, I can't handle this place
without you.

208
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,583
I'll talk to your mom and dad,
and I'll tell them how unfair this is.

209
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,458
I'll call you Queen Sophie of Gavaldon.

210
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,500
I will even let you give me a makeover.

211
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
Just please don't go.

212
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,500
-Okay.
-You promise?

213
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,000
I promise.

214
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,708
-Oh, thank you!
-Oh!

215
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,166
"Queen Sophie of Gavaldon."

216
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,791
<i>It was at that moment Sophie decided</i>

217
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:03,041
<i>she was beyond wishing</i>
<i>for her life to magically improve.</i>

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,125
<i>It was time to take charge of her destiny.</i>

219
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:14,250
<i>Even if it meant breaking the promise</i>
<i>she'd made to her best and only friend.</i>

220
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,666
I'm so sorry, Aggie.

221
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:27,166
<i>But some wishes are</i>
<i>simply too powerful to take back.</i>

222
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,875
You were gonna run away after all?

223
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,250
Aggie, I'm sorry.

224
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,583
-What was that?

225
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:53,916
-The red sky. It's happening.

226
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,125
Sophie.

227
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,000
Hey, we have to get out of here.

228
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,166
-Aggie, this is what I wished for.
-You what?

229
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,416
-Sophie!

230
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,791
Sophie!

231
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,291
-Hold on! I'm coming!

232
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,333
So long, Gavaldon!

233
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,500
Farewell, mediocrity!

234
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,250
-Goodbye, low ambition!

235
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,625
-Aggie, no!

236
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,000
Please let me go!

237
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,708
No way! I'm never letting you go!

238
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,250
-No.

239
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,041
-No.

240
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,000
No, Aggie, what was happening
was a good thing.

241
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,833
I'm sorry, Sophie,
but I… I couldn't take that chance.

242
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,708
I can't let anything bad happen to you.

243
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, I know.

244
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,916
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

245
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,000
Aggie, this is good.

246
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,833
No, no, no, no! This is not good!

247
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,083
It's okay!

248
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,958
This is it!

249
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,958
-This is real! I was right!

250
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,833
Aggie, look.
That must be the School for Good.

251
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,833
It's so beautiful.

252
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,666
Wait, that means that's--

253
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,625
Oh God, the other one.

254
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,625
Aggie, this is everything
I've ever wanted.

255
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,333
This is not what <i>I </i>wanted!

256
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,708
No, Sophie, we have to get back.
You know my mom can't get by without me.

257
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,625
I'm sure this will take you home
once it drops me at the Good school.

258
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,750
I want it to take us <i>both </i>back!

259
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, Aggie!

260
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:24,125
No! You're supposed to drop <i>me</i>
at the Good school, not <i>her!</i>

261
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,791
No, take me back! Please!

262
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,541
No! You don't understand! I'm Good--

263
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,083
Ah, great. The bird ate my shirt.

264
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,291
Oh wow.

265
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,583
Can I touch your hair?

266
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,208
-Most witches don't have princess hair.

267
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,208
-I bet it smells like cake.

268
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,666
I love cake.

269
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,708
-I'm not a witch!
-Hey! Hey, where are you going?

270
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,833
Oh, come on!

271
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,500
-Help me!

272
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,833
Fall in line, newbie.

273
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,625
-Get over there.

274
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,083
-Oh!

275
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,500
-Sorry.
-Watch it, freak.

276
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,666
Hey, no!

277
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,041
You have to listen to me.
I am <i>not</i> supposed to be here. I'm Good!

278
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,708
God, I hate move-in day.

279
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,208
I'm supposed to be a princess,
not a villain!

280
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,375
-No!

281
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,166
-Ow.

282
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,166
Did she just kill a fairy?

283
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,291
Uh, what?

284
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,708
-Oh.

285
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,458
Ah.

286
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,916
-Son of a--
-Oh dear.

287
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,500
You must be lost.

288
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,041
Yeah.
Yeah, that is an understatement.

289
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,250
-How do I get out of here? I…

290
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,208
Ugh. What the hell is it?

291
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,500
It looks like a witch.

292
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,916
I'm thinking a troll.

293
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
I say demon.

294
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,333
Maybe part hunchback?

295
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,541
I don't have a hunch.

296
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,208
Then you really need a tailor.

297
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,125
How do I get over to that school?

298
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,541
I knew from its smell.

299
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,000
It's a Never.

300
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,500
-Just listen!

301
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,458
I just need to find my friend.

302
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,875
Ah, whatever,
the fairies will get rid of her.

303
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,041
-Come, girls.

304
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,375
-Mm.
-What? I'm leaving.

305
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,250
No, no, no. I need--

306
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,958
-Stop doing that!

307
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,125
What are you…?

308
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,708
No, let me go!

309
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,416
Get off of me!

310
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,125
Ta-da!

311
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,500
Me again.

312
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,500
Put her there.

313
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,500
It's cleaner than my own hand.

314
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,500
Trust me.

315
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,041
-I'm Hort, by the way.
-Hort?

316
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,791
That sounds like something you cough up.

317
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,833
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

318
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,291
Weirdo.

319
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,166
Excuse me, ma'am.

320
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,208
You seem to be in charge,
and I am in the wrong school.

321
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,208
Ooh! How distressful. And improbable.

322
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,000
-Back up. Your name?

323
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,625
Actually, you know what? I wanna guess it.

324
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,625
You won't know it.

325
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,791
Mm, Sophie.

326
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:52,958
Of Gavaldon.

327
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,125
Did I guess it?

328
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
-I always do.
-There must be a mistake.

329
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,625
-I clear--
-You're the Reader.

330
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,791
-I read, if that's what you mean.
-Shh, shh, shh. It's not.

331
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,541
Every so often,
a very lucky candidate from the outside

332
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,625
is selected for admission
to this hallowed institution.

333
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,708
We call them… Readers

334
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,416
because they only get to read
about the amazing adventures

335
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,625
that originate here.

336
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,833
-Now, please, excuse me.

337
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,916
I have fresh villainy to attend to.

338
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,458
Showtime!

339
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,333
-Attention!

340
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,166
-Attention, future Evil!

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,541
If you open your
tiny little bloodshot eyes,

342
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:39,458
you'll find your dormitory
and class schedules around the hall.

343
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:43,083
It would serve you well to memorize both.

344
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,666
Make me proud.

345
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,166
Oh my God.

346
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,875
Don't you ever touch me again.

347
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,750
-All right! Okay.

348
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,541
I thought fairies were
supposed to be nice.

349
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,625
Oh, I must be in hell.

350
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,541
Ugh.

351
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,541
Well, this is hell, all right.

352
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,916
What…?

353
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,541
-Holy sh--
-Well, hello.

354
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:48,958
I see you found the Groom Room.

355
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,666
Well done, Agatha of Gavaldon.

356
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,916
Might I suggest
you clean up a bit before orientation?

357
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,375
Or perhaps clean up a lot.

358
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,333
How do you know my name?

359
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,500
Because I've been expecting you.

360
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:06,791
I am Professor Dovey,
here to help however I can.

361
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,125
Finally. My friend Sophie
wanted to be here.

362
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,000
-The Never? No.
-The what?

363
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,666
Your friend is a Never.

364
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,166
You are an Ever.

365
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:22,041
Ever, because we believe
in living happily ever after.

366
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,208
Nevers, because they don't.

367
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,500
School for Evil, School for Good.

368
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,916
-Evil--
-Yup, okay, I got it.

369
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,458
-But clearly, there's been a mistake.
-Hmm?

370
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,583
I mean, look at me.

371
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:41,166
My dear,
one doesn't measure one's goodness

372
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,166
just by how one looks.

373
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,666
-No, it's about what one does.

374
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,250
If you're here,
you must have great… power.

375
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,791
Trust me, I don't.

376
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,958
Well then, I bet you just need
to learn to summon it.

377
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,625
<i>Feel </i>it.

378
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,666
Because magic follows emotion.

379
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,291
The stronger the emotion,
the more powerful the magic.

380
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,375
-Summon enough passion,

381
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:16,208
and you can accomplish anything.

382
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,375
For you.

383
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,583
-How did you do that?
-I just told you.

384
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,958
-Okay.
-Yes.

385
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,666
Thank you so much for the show.

386
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,541
Um, have fun with your magic tricks, lady.

387
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,916
I've gotta find my friend
and get back to Gavaldon.

388
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,083
Stop!

389
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,583
Look, if there was a mistake,

390
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,791
then it is one
that <i>someone</i> is going to get fired for.

391
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,541
-Literally.

392
00:25:54,625 --> 00:26:00,166
So, let's pretend there is not a mistake
until we can sort this all out, yes?

393
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,000
Besides, there is no way back.

394
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,916
Wait, what?

395
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,208
Oh, I know! Let's get you
in your armor.

396
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,625
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

397
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:19,041
-Oh, yes! Look at them!

398
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,333
Let me guess.
You're not a pink person?

399
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,750
Not a problem!

400
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,125
We also have rose, fuchsia, blush,

401
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,000
watermelon, hibiscus.

402
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,791
So many colors!

403
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,916
-I just love my job.

404
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,875
-Wait, Sophie!
-Aggie!

405
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,541
-Hey!
-Hey!

406
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,541
They gave you a gown?

407
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,375
-Sit down and shut up, Reader!

408
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,500
Wait.

409
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,791
-Come on.

410
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,875
Okay.

411
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,250
And stay there!

412
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,291
Hey.

413
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,333
Me again.

414
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,708
-Oh my God.

415
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,041
-Excuse me.

416
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,250
My father tells me not to talk to Readers.

417
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,875
He says they're bad luck.

418
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,875
You've probably read about my father.

419
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:22,833
Captain Hook?

420
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,625
He's got a pretty awesome ship.

421
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,458
-Do you want a bite? It's nice and putrid.

422
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,458
Grace and beauty first?

423
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,416
-Oh, if you insist, Clarissa.
-So glad you agree.

424
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,583
-Welcome, first-year students!

425
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,791
I am Professor Dovey,

426
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,125
Dean of the School for Good.

427
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,125
Evers!
Evers! Evers! Evers! Evers!

428
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:56,875
And I'm Lady Lesso,
Dean of the School for Evil.

429
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:00,958
Kill you!
Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Kill you!

430
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:04,666
-There's no boys in the School for Good?
-Ugh, there's plenty.

431
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,250
And get ready to be nauseous.

432
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,541
As per tradition,
the winning school from last year…

433
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,541
Us again. Imagine that!

434
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,958
-Hmm. Imagine.
-…will now grace us all

435
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,666
with a display
of their chivalrous talents.

436
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,791
-Ugh.
-Gentlemen!

437
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,875
What a bunch of losers.

438
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,750
Oh my.

439
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,208
-Aren't they wonderful?

440
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,208
-Oh.

441
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:25,708
If you boys are finished with dance class,
maybe you'd like to have a real fight.

442
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,458
Oh no.

443
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,125
What do you say?

444
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,958
-Who… is… that?

445
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,625
It's Tedros!

446
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,250
His dad was king,

447
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,041
so of course
he has to have his own stupid entrance.

448
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:54,000
You know what? Let's make it easy for you.

449
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,583
Charge!

450
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,416
Yes!

451
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:14,666
I don't know what the big deal
about owning a round table is, anyway.

452
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,083
His father was King Arthur?

453
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:19,041
-Yawn.
-Wow.

454
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,791
-He…

455
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,125
-Nice work, fellas.

456
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,125
Let's see how you do
in a real fight, pretty boy.

457
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,916
Prepare to die.

458
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,291
Get him! Get him!

459
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,541
-Huh?
-Mm.

460
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,375
Oh, come on.

461
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:57,166
If we're gonna do this,
we might as well do it right.

462
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,500
Ugh.

463
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,083
-Yes, yes, yes!

464
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,916
Oh, come on! Foul!

465
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,083
Anybody! He's got a magical sword.

466
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,833
How's that fair?

467
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,291
That's Excalibur.

468
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,708
Really?

469
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:32,291
I know. How evil of me.

470
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:21,916
Come on!

471
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,083
Dammit.

472
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,500
Oh, how <i>good </i>of you to lose again.

473
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,916
Bravo! Bravo!

474
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,958
-A heroic display!

475
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,291
Look--

476
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,125
Uh…

477
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:56,500
-Excuse me, milady. I believe, uh--
-That I don't belong here? Yeah, I know.

478
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,125
Don't want your stupid rose anyway.

479
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:01,375
Oh, and by the way,
this is what a normal girl looks like.

480
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,625
He intended it for me.

481
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,708
Normal girl.

482
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,250
There's an open seat next to me, Teddy.

483
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:16,583
And, for the record, you don't know
what I was about to say, but…

484
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,208
nice try.

485
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,875
What did he smell like?

486
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,083
Ego.

487
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:35,583
In these two schools,
we will take away any confusion

488
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:40,208
and make your souls as pure as possible.

489
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,458
Pure Good.

490
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,375
Or pure Evil.

491
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:49,000
Future heroes and villains,
you have been chosen

492
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:51,208
to protect and maintain

493
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,041
the balance between Good and Evil.

494
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,208
For if that balance is ever compromised--

495
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,791
I don't think we need to get into that
just now with our new friends, do we?

496
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:04,333
-It's such a happy first day.

497
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,500
-Let's not be downers, hmm?

498
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:12,000
Besides, I'm sure this new class
will perform exceptionally well.

499
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,541
And like your parents before you,
you are all here because

500
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:20,416
the world of story needs
great heroes and villains

501
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,708
to teach the people of the outside world

502
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,958
to make choices to find their way.

503
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:29,916
So, obey the rules,
study hard, and remember,

504
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,416
the Storian only chooses
the very best of our students

505
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,625
for their own adventure.

506
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,916
But what if we've been dropped
in the wrong school?

507
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Or there's been a mistake
and we need to go home immediately?

508
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:48,750
There are no mistakes
in the School for Good and Evil,

509
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:49,875
so…

510
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,000
have a nice semester.

511
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:03,458
<i>All students,</i>
<i>report to your assigned sleeping quarters.</i>

512
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,916
-Perfect.

513
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,000
The Good do not room with Evil.

514
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,791
-Reena…
-Hmm?

515
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,541
Tell the fairies to come get my bags.

516
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,125
-I'm moving.

517
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,208
Mm, but I'll miss you so.

518
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,958
Try not to ruin anything.

519
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,083
Sweet dreams, Never.

520
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,833
-Hey!

521
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,250
-No, no, no! No, you don't understand!

522
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,250
I need to find my friend!

523
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,416
Whoa.

524
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,333
Ugh, I told you we'd get her.

525
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,333
Let me guess.

526
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,916
-It's Belle.

527
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,375
Or Anastasia. Or Sugar Plum.

528
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:23,833
-Actually, my name is Sophie.

529
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,375
-Ah!
-You two have no manners.

530
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,000
Welcome to room 66.

531
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,500
I'm Dot, daughter of Robert de Rainault.

532
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:37,916
-Robert…
-Hello? The Sheriff of Nottingham.

533
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,250
It's okay. He's not, like, super famous.

534
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,791
Yeah, who's ever heard of Robin Hood?

535
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,791
-Learn your history, cream puff.

536
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,041
Anyway, that's Anadil.

537
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,541
-And that ray of sunshine is Hester.

538
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,333
-You can bunk next to me, Sophie.

539
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,083
That's a funny name for a villain.

540
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,958
-Oh, please.

541
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:03,833
-She's <i>so</i> not a villain.
-Of course I'm not.

542
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,250
Look at me.

543
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,083
Do I look like a witch?

544
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,458
Or a troll?

545
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,583
Or some disgusting old hag?

546
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,666
That hag

547
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,166
is my mother.

548
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,750
Okay, eyes up, Agatha.

549
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:47,333
It's just a Cupid, stupid.

550
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,125
Okay, don't be lame.

551
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,333
Don't be lame.

552
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,583
You got this.

553
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,208
Phew. Okay.

554
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:56,750
Okay.

555
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,250
Oh.

556
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,250
Uh, hi.

557
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:11,250
Students aren't allowed on the ledge.

558
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,583
Prepare for punishment!

559
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:35,083
-And I thought Gavaldon was bad.

560
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,500
All right, princess.

561
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:44,208
What's so important
we had to trek all the way up here?

562
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,625
I'm in heels, you know.

563
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,500
-It's the Readers.

564
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:51,375
And their insistence
that they shouldn't be where they are.

565
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:54,291
-And something does feel <i>wrong.</i>

566
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,666
The only thing that feels wrong

567
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,208
is the School Master's decision
to bring them here in the first place.

568
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:01,916
What if he did make a mistake?

569
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,333
What if he dropped them
in the wrong schools

570
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,125
and something terrible happens?

571
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,583
He'd never admit it.

572
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:12,000
He'd blame one of us to save face,
and you know what would happen then.

573
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,666
There is no mistake.
Besides, I'd think you'd be happy.

574
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,708
I'm stuck with yet another underachiever.

575
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,500
Sophie of Gavaldon.

576
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,541
What? What? No. Whatever do you mean?

577
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,166
Pfft. Please.

578
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,083
Evil hasn't won anything
in over 200 years.

579
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,833
Well, you've come close a couple of times.

580
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:33,333
Close doesn't cut it!

581
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,375
Ugh!

582
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,000
I just have to work my students
twice as hard.

583
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:37,958
Mm.

584
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,958
Because a world
where Evil is not as powerful as Good

585
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,125
is a world out of balance.

586
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,000
Now, if you'll excuse me…

587
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,583
…I have a lot of work to do.

588
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,500
Lesso!

589
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,958
Stay away from Sophie,
little witch.

590
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,541
-She has a destiny to fulfill.

591
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,875
And she belongs to me now.

592
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,791
Where are you, Sophie?

593
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,583
I'm sure your mother's beautiful
on the inside.

594
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,666
-I have to get to the other school.

595
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,916
-I'm Good.
-Yeah, at disguising your Evil.

596
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,208
I am <i>not </i>Evil.

597
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,208
Let's settle this with science.

598
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,333
-Oh my--

599
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,041
If she's Good,
the fairies will catch her when she falls.

600
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:49,333
But if she smashes on the rocks
in a gruesome, skull-splintering death,

601
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,125
she's Evil.

602
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,541
The second one. Do the second one.

603
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:56,083
But she <i>is </i>a villain.
She just doesn't know it yet.

604
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,708
No, I'm Good!

605
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,750
Aw, she whines like an Ever.

606
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:02,500
Smells like an Ever.

607
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,875
-Has hair like an Ever.

608
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:05,791
Or <i>had.</i>

609
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:06,833
Hey!

610
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,541
Not the hair!

611
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,583
You want proof that I'm Good?
Then get a mirror, and look in it.

612
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,791
You hag!

613
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,833
Told ya. Definitely Evil.

614
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,541
-Sophie!
-Aggie!

615
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,375
-Aggie, hey.

616
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,291
-Come on.
-Wait, where are we going?

617
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,666
To get you out of here.

618
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,791
-Oh, good.
-Not good.

619
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,375
Some… thing is after you.

620
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,458
I saw it.

621
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,833
Okay. So we're ending this now.

622
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,291
Aggie, no! It's not worth it!

623
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,750
-Come on.
-<i>Agatha's plan was simple.</i>

624
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,250
<i>Find the School Master</i>

625
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:02,041
<i>and plead their case</i>
<i>to leave the school directly to him.</i>

626
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,333
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

627
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,125
How do we get in?

628
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,666
He definitely came up here.

629
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:11,458
I saw it.

630
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,666
Hey! Let us in!

631
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,291
Great.

632
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,583
Now we're stuck up here.

633
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,083
<i>Would they be prepared</i>

634
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,666
<i>for what awaited them in the shadows?</i>

635
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,416
<i>Agatha called into the darkness.</i>

636
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,625
Hello?

637
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,041
-<i>But there was no response.</i>

638
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,166
Who is that?

639
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,666
<i>Sophie discovered</i>
<i>that books lined the walls,</i>

640
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,375
<i>filled with stories</i>
<i>from every corner of the world.</i>

641
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,916
-You know we hear you narrating, weirdo.

642
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,333
If you're trying to scare us,
it's not working.

643
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:53,958
<i>The girls heard</i>
<i>a scratching in the blackness.</i>

644
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,583
<i>They moved warily toward it.</i>

645
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,500
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

646
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,875
-All of that, and it's a dumb pen?

647
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:00,791
Sophie, stop!

648
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,791
-Don't touch!

649
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,250
You know, no students
have ever made it into my tower.

650
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,041
I knew you were special.

651
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:13,541
The Storian began writing your story
before you even arrived.

652
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:18,666
Guess that's why I'm so confused
as to why the two of you want to leave.

653
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,958
<i>She </i>wants to leave. I don't.

654
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,208
Sophie, I have to get you out of here.

655
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:27,375
Ahem. Ladies, ladies. I can assure you,
you are both perfectly safe here.

656
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,458
We pride ourselves
on protecting our Readers.

657
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,250
Really? Then what about
the spinning tower of blood

658
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,291
I just saw obsessing over Sophie?

659
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,833
Well, my friend, you see,
there are so many random spirits

660
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:40,125
and personalized spells flying
around this school, even I can't keep up.

661
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,750
Well, I think she's in danger.

662
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,625
So, unfortunately,
we can't just languish here

663
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:48,291
while you train us
to be in some silly fairy tales.

664
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:52,500
Our graduates live the very real events
that change the world,

665
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:56,625
which become the stories
that change the world.

666
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,041
You're trying to tell me that Snow White

667
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:03,041
and Cinderella
and Jack and the Beanstalk were real?

668
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,416
As were Hercules

669
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,291
and Sinbad

670
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,583
and El Cid

671
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,458
and all the others
who have battled the forces of Evil.

672
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:19,583
We teach you how to fulfill your destiny.

673
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:23,416
And that's exactly what I wanna learn,
but you put me in the wrong school.

674
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,208
I'm supposed to be in Good.

675
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,125
You made a mistake.

676
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,541
-Hmm.
-Sir.

677
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:33,291
Well, perhaps I have.
But I'll need you to prove it.

678
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,750
Why, if it's your mistake?

679
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:39,958
Because once something
is written by the Storian,

680
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,583
only the Storian can change its course.

681
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:43,875
This is ridiculous.

682
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,875
How are we supposed to change its mind,
if it even has one?

683
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,125
Oh, but it does.

684
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,208
And there's only one way, really.

685
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,583
What is the one thing
that Evil can never have

686
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,916
that Good can never do without?

687
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,750
Oh, I know. Manners.

688
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,166
A castle.

689
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,958
Amazing hair. A horse.

690
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:04,041
Mm.

691
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,416
True love.

692
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Which is
traditionally manifested in a kiss.

693
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,583
So you're saying…

694
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,708
I can't believe I'm actually saying this.

695
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:16,375
If Sophie were
to kiss her true love,

696
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:19,541
that would prove to Quilly over there
that you were wrong about us?

697
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:25,333
If one from School of Evil
won true love's kiss,

698
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,416
it would change everything.

699
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,000
And I could stay and switch schools?

700
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:31,375
Sophie.

701
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:35,291
This is all I've ever wanted, Aggie.
I can't go back to Gavaldon.

702
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,666
Not to my old life.

703
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,541
I will never get this chance again.

704
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,250
Please, let me do this.

705
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,791
-I'll think about it.
-Excellent.

706
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:49,416
Well, I guess somebody
better go find herself a prince to kiss.

707
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,958
But remember, dear Reader,

708
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:55,916
no kiss comes without its price.

709
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,041
-Wait, what does that mean?

710
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,583
-<i>Good morning, darlings!</i>

711
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,291
<i>Rise and shine!</i>

712
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:10,833
<i>The first event of the semester,</i>
<i>the Evers Ball, is only two weeks away,</i>

713
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,708
<i>and you've got a lot to learn.</i>

714
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,916
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

715
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,458
Good morning, Agatha.

716
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,791
-<i>Wake up, despicables!</i>

717
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,291
Psst.

718
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,458
Who's that?

719
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,666
-Dark… Dark hair.
-Tristan.

720
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,333
I caught his rose.

721
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:48,291
I hope he invites me to the Evers Ball.

722
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,833
You have to get a boy to ask you,
or you fail.

723
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,583
And you do not want to fail.

724
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,750
Three fails, and you're expelled.

725
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,916
-Wait, you mean they kick you out?
-Uh…

726
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,333
No.

727
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,833
They actually turn you
into something else.

728
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:03,416
Like a talking tea kettle

729
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:06,333
or a mouse or something much worse.

730
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,416
Wait, like forever? What?

731
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Uglify!

732
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,416
-Why do we need to be ugly?

733
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,375
-Hort! Wake up!

734
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:22,208
Oh, because it makes little children cry.

735
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:23,291
Wrong.

736
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,375
-That's merely a bonus.

737
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,375
Ah.

738
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:32,000
Why be revolting and repugnant?

739
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,083
My question exactly.

740
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,583
Ah, not caring how you look

741
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:41,666
forces you to use your intelligence.

742
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:45,208
Ugliness is freedom!

743
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:55,333
My tooth just fell out.

744
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,750
It's disgusting.

745
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,166
And I don't care.

746
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,541
And that is power!

747
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,166
-Bring it down, girls.

748
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,875
-I am Professor Anemone,

749
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:17,250
and I am here to show you
how to become a truly powerful woman

750
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,208
through beauty.

751
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,208
A lady's smile is a sword

752
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:28,708
in the battle for life and for true love.

753
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,666
-So, pick up your mirrors…

754
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,125
…and strike!

755
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:38,375
-Lovely, Reena.
-Thank you, Professor.

756
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:41,750
Exquisite, Beatrix.

757
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:47,583
I'm sorry. This just feels so wrong.

758
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,250
Smiling? That's how you're empowering us?

759
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:56,041
Smiling is a strict requirement
for passing this course.

760
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:00,916
So, show me your smile
if you don't want to fail.

761
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,958
My… smile?

762
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,333
Mm-hmm.

763
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:09,625
-I don't feel safe.
-Mm-hmm.

764
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,541
Wait. What is that?

765
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,208
A fail, Reader.

766
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:27,416
Wait, you're… you're failing me
for being a bad smiler?

767
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,083
-Yeah. Let's get to work.

768
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:34,208
Ah, now, prepare to drink up

769
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:39,750
and see how ugly and powerful you can be.

770
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,125
-Reader.

771
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,208
You're first.

772
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,583
No. I don't want to be ugly.

773
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:51,416
-It's not who I am.

774
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,083
Not yet. Hort!

775
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:56,166
Uh, yes, sir, Professor Manley.

776
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,833
Sorry about this.

777
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:01,083
But don't worry.
You'll still look beautiful to me.

778
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,708
It's, um, Agatha, right?

779
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,875
-Hi.
-Do you mind if I sit with you?

780
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,458
-No.
-Great.

781
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,625
-If you want to.
-Uh…

782
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,291
I'm Gregor.

783
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,458
Um, Gregor Charming.

784
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,500
The, uh… the prince's son.

785
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,416
I'll try not to be
too charming.

786
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,708
-I'm Agatha.
-I heard you don't want to be here.

787
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:42,083
Well, I don't either.

788
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,583
-You don't?
-I'm not cut out to be a prince.

789
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,333
It's… It's not who I am.

790
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,458
Do you know what I'd rather do?
Run my own grocery store.

791
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,333
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

792
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:56,666
I love food, but I wouldn't sell meat
'cause I can't stand the sight of blood.

793
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,666
That's actually why I got a fail today.
I got nicked in a duel.

794
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:03,125
I'm sorry,
they failed you for one tiny cut?

795
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,791
Not quite.

796
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,666
I saw the blood,
and I passed out in my heavy armor.

797
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,000
I was on top of a hill,

798
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,000
and so I started rolling down,

799
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,541
knocking over everyone in my path.

800
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,291
-Definitely grocery-store material, right?

801
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:26,000
I think you should do
whatever makes you happiest, Gregor.

802
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,500
I'm sorry, Gregor,
will… will you excuse me?

803
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,583
Oh, uh…

804
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,666
Sure. See you around, Agatha.

805
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,416
-Thanks.

806
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,666
-Did you get attacked?
-Yes.

807
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,875
By tadpoles.

808
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:45,416
In ugly class.

809
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,708
Well, I failed beauty class.

810
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,000
What part did you fail?

811
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,291
Smiling.

812
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,250
Smiling?

813
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,916
Forget it. I found you a prince to kiss.

814
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,625
I already found my true love.

815
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,666
-Tedros.

816
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,458
We had a connection
from the moment we saw each other.

817
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:02,791
Plus, we just make sense, aesthetically.

818
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:05,166
Well, unfortunately,
Beatrix already has him.

819
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,833
You think she's prettier than me?

820
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:10,375
I'm just saying
we need someone who's available now.

821
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:12,291
School Master said
it had to be true love's kiss.

822
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:14,125
Sophie, a kiss is a kiss.

823
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,208
Oh, really?

824
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,291
Oh.

825
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,791
See? Nothing happened.

826
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,333
Has to be true love.

827
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm okay to keep this casual.

828
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,791
Aren't you sweet?

829
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:33,083
Just give him this,
and tell him how good and kind I am.

830
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,458
Oh!

831
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,750
And don't be weird.

832
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,458
You know what I mean.

833
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,250
Don't talk about your cat.

834
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,458
-Fine.
-Fine.

835
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,625
Just get him interested.

836
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,375
I'll handle the rest.

837
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:09,833
Get off me!

838
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,250
-Who are you?

839
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,541
I am the Gnome of the Blue Forest.

840
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,833
But I thought gnomes
were supposed to be short.

841
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,416
I thought princesses
were supposed to be likable.

842
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,500
Welcome, students! Gather round.

843
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:34,041
I need you all to sign in
so I know who survived and who hasn't.

844
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:36,208
Hey. Normal girl.

845
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:38,458
How's the mind reading coming along?

846
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,875
Uh… Oh.

847
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:45,416
Yeah. No. Sorry about that. That was…

848
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,166
I was just really overwhelmed
when I first got here.

849
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:52,125
-Yeah. This place can be overwhelming.
-Mm.

850
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:55,000
Never had a princess
cop an attitude like that before, though.

851
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,208
Really is quite impressive.

852
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,750
Mm, do they usually all smile
and bat their eyes at you?

853
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:04,458
Yes, they do, which is incredibly boring,
so thank you for not being boring.

854
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,708
Uh, no, I'm actually, uh, pretty boring.

855
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,250
The only person
who doesn't think so is my cat.

856
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,958
Mm, no, I…

857
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:16,791
Well, they say, uh,
cats are good judges of character.

858
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,500
-They do?
-They will.

859
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:23,000
Now that I've said it.

860
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,791
I'm quite famous here, you know.

861
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:26,791
-Number one fairy-tale prince and all.

862
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,833
Yeah, I think…
I think when you become king,

863
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,375
they're probably gonna have to
find a bigger crown

864
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,250
to fit on that swelled head of yours.

865
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,833
Um…

866
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,875
-Nice. Nice.

867
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,291
Uh…

868
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:48,958
Um…

869
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:51,458
This is for you.

870
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,791
-Yeah?
-Not from me.

871
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,291
From my friend, Sophie.

872
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,833
Oh, the… the witch with the gorgeous hair?

873
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:02,083
No, no. She's not a witch.
She was just dropped in the wrong school.

874
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:05,000
No, that does not happen, normal girl.
She's definitely playing you.

875
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,416
Well, in this case, it did.

876
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,958
Trust me. She is… definitely a princess.

877
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,500
My name is Agatha, by the way.

878
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,083
Agatha.

879
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:17,916
Much better.

880
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,333
'Cause you're definitely not normal.

881
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:22,500
In a good way.

882
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,458
All right, come on, everybody!
Come on, gather round.

883
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,250
-Let's can the balloon juice.

884
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,458
-Hmm?

885
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,333
I am Yuba,
the school woods survival expert.

886
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,541
I've lived in them for hundreds of years,
and I haven't died once.

887
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,458
At least…

888
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:41,750
…not that I can remember.

889
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:48,208
Oh! That's just a little gnome humor.

890
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,833
So, off we jolly well go.

891
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,666
All right, let's get these doors open.

892
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,750
Go on.

893
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:55,583
Open!

894
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,208
Open.

895
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:06,083
Open the forest doors!

896
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,458
Thank you.

897
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:09,458
-Follow me, everybody!

898
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:13,500
You cannot survive any adventure
if you cannot survive the woods.

899
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:19,500
The Blue Forest prepares students
for any perils you may face.

900
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:20,416
Hey.

901
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
Oh, uh…

902
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:23,416
Hi.

903
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,375
Gregor, what happened to your forehead?

904
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:28,708
I failed, uh, steed-riding this morning.

905
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,083
-Gregor!

906
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,333
Turns out I'm not really any good
with horses.

907
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,541
And I think I might need glasses.

908
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,416
That grocery store's
looking better and better, right?

909
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,000
-Stay away from Tedros, you goon.

910
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,333
-He's mine.

911
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,416
Oops.

912
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,458
Hey there.

913
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:52,833
Come on!

914
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,208
A field of pretty pansies,

915
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:59,500
but as we know from our fairy tales,

916
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:03,375
pretty can sometimes kill you.

917
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,666
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

918
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,916
Cheeky plant.

919
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,208
That's, uh… That's one bouquet
you wouldn't want to catch at a wedding.

920
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,375
Gnome humor.

921
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,125
Right.

922
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:31,958
It's okay, Gregor.

923
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,583
It can't get you. You're fine.

924
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:36,583
I really hate this place.

925
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,500
Quick, quick! Come on.

926
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:46,750
Ah, this is Yuba's favorite part.

927
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,625
The pumpkin patch.

928
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,875
Benign by day,

929
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:54,000
but by night, a grisly horror world

930
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,666
where reapers will hunt you down,

931
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,250
drink your blood,

932
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,541
and sell your limbs for spoils!

933
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,416
-Reapers? What are those?

934
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,666
One of those.

935
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,458
That's just a scarecrow.

936
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:12,875
And I suppose pansies are just flowers.

937
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:20,250
Remember, only the best Evil
can disguise as Good.

938
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:25,833
-I've gotta get out of here!
-No, bad idea.

939
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,291
Let go of me!

940
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,208
Gregor, stop!

941
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,208
You've already got two fails!

942
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:32,083
Gregor! Gregor!

943
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:35,666
Gregor, you don't know
what they'll do to you!

944
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,666
-Come on, come back!
-I'll be fine!

945
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,958
Help me!

946
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,666
Agatha!

947
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:24,583
Gregor?

948
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,541
<i>Every villain has a special talent</i>

949
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,333
they can hone into a powerful weapon

950
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:35,625
to defeat their nemesis.

951
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,083
What's a nemesis?

952
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,916
Your archenemy.

953
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:45,125
Your story will not end
until one of you is destroyed.

954
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:50,291
Now, I want you to dazzle me

955
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:53,958
with whatever you believe
your unique talent to be.

956
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,333
Hort, you're first.

957
01:00:57,166 --> 01:01:00,958
Well, I've been working on
my werewolf powers in hex class.

958
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,208
Watch this.

959
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,333
-Hmm!
-Well done, Hort!

960
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,416
All right.

961
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,166
Next time I need
a skinny, one-haired werewolf,

962
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,375
-I'll make sure to call you. Sit down.

963
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,916
-Dot?
-Hmm?

964
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,500
Please tell me you can do better.

965
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,583
Watch me.

966
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,375
Is it poisoned?

967
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,750
It… could be.

968
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,666
Well, it's better than a stray hair.

969
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:50,500
We can work with that.

970
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,583
Sophie.

971
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,875
Those who are truly Good
can summon the animals of the forest.

972
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,791
-Mm.
-I used to do it with my squirrel friends.

973
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:03,250
Oh God, give it up.

974
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,375
Why don't you summon a cliff
and go jump off it?

975
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:08,750
Why don't you find someone else
to have mommy issues with?

976
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:11,166
Don't you dare talk about my mother.

977
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,666
You know <i>nothing</i> about her!

978
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:17,166
I know she did one hell of a good job
turning you into a raving lunatic.

979
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,250
I despise you, you freak.

980
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:25,083
And everything you stand for.

981
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:27,833
Which just proves
that I am at the wrong school.

982
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:31,083
-You want to get out of here, princess?

983
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:35,583
This raving lunatic's unique talent
would be more than happy

984
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,708
to get rid of you permanently.

985
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:49,708
This is delightful.

986
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:18,625
-Sophie, watch out!

987
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,083
-Go!

988
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:41,083
Oh!

989
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:44,125
Be careful, Reader,
she's getting really close.

990
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,625
Use your talents.

991
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,875
I don't know what they are!

992
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:53,291
Your squirrel friends, Sophie!
Call your squirrel friends!

993
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:55,250
Help! Help me!

994
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,666
Help!

995
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,291
Aw, guess the squirrels
don't like you either.

996
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:03,458
You poor little princess.

997
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,291
Let me put you out of your misery.

998
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,916
-She's gonna kill her!

999
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:37,875
Sophie, you're not allowed to kill anyone
until after graduation.

1000
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,250
Call them off!

1001
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:41,750
-Stop!

1002
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:02,833
Oh my God.

1003
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:08,333
Rafal?

1004
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,791
You're doing wonderfully…

1005
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,666
…Sophie.

1006
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,250
-Move out of the way!
-Move!

1007
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:00,875
Hester!

1008
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,583
-You're fine. It's okay.

1009
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,500
-It's okay.
-Gonna be okay. Breathe.

1010
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,750
We'll make sure
you're fine, okay? It's okay.

1011
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:10,041
-It's okay.

1012
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:13,375
Who is that? Who is Rafal?

1013
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:14,958
Do not say his name again.

1014
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,416
Not to anyone but me.

1015
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,166
-Who is he, and how does he know me?
-Shh. He's the School Master's brother.

1016
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,458
He was once the most powerful being
in our school.

1017
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:27,458
Evil hasn't beaten Good
ever since he disappeared.

1018
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:30,666
But somehow, your powers…
your powers have drawn his attention.

1019
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,291
I didn't know I had powers.
I don't want powers. I want to go--

1020
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,625
Oh, stop your whining!

1021
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,333
What you just did in that classroom

1022
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,041
is proof to me
that you are exactly where you belong!

1023
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:42,458
It's not what we are.

1024
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,958
It's what we do, Sophie.

1025
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,583
Now go.

1026
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,083
And tell no one.

1027
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:52,166
And if Rafal visits you again,
you must tell me immediately.

1028
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,375
Go, go.

1029
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,625
If she is the one, Rafal…

1030
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,291
I'll do everything in my power
to deliver her to you.

1031
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,625
My love.

1032
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,083
-No, no, no.

1033
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,875
Of course we don't hate.

1034
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,333
Evil hates.

1035
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:18,791
Good loves.

1036
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,375
Evil attacks.

1037
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,208
Good defends.

1038
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:27,916
Chinen, when is Good permitted to attack?

1039
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,750
It isn't. Good can only defend.

1040
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:34,416
If Good were to attack first,
by definition, it would be no longer Good.

1041
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,583
Precisely.

1042
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,500
What did you people do to him?

1043
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,125
I'm sorry?

1044
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,125
Gregor failed three times,

1045
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:46,125
and then he disappeared,
screaming in pain.

1046
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,625
What did you turn him into?

1047
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:51,125
The rules at this school must be obeyed.

1048
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,333
There are no exceptions.

1049
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,916
Ladies, as… as I was saying,

1050
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,833
Evil has many weapons, but we…

1051
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:06,833
we have animals.

1052
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,166
Animals of the land, animals of the water.

1053
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:17,125
-And so, ladies, today I present to you…

1054
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,500
…wish fish,

1055
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,625
shimmering underwater friends,

1056
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:27,500
who understand us and our deepest desires.

1057
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:29,833
Is that because
they used to be students here?

1058
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,416
Enough.

1059
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:35,583
Not everyone earns their own story.

1060
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:40,875
At least they can still be
part of someone else's happy ending.

1061
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:43,875
Ladies, if your wish is strong enough,

1062
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:46,833
then they might make it come true.

1063
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,666
-Who's first?

1064
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,958
Me! Me, me!

1065
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,833
-Kiko.

1066
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,750
It's Tristan! He loves me.

1067
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:11,333
Let me try.

1068
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:13,083
-Tristan.
-Move, Kiko.

1069
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:14,208
-Move.
-Ah.

1070
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:16,041
-Get out of the way.

1071
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:29,791
Tedros.

1072
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,291
We look perfect together.

1073
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,666
The Evers Ball,

1074
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:43,083
where many of you
may receive your first kiss next week!

1075
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:45,458
Agatha.

1076
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,333
Your turn.

1077
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,375
Any wish?

1078
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:57,041
Whatever your heart most desires.

1079
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,583
I wish for home.
For all of us.

1080
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,583
What are you doing?

1081
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,125
What's happening?

1082
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,458
That's enough now, Agatha. Please stop.

1083
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,750
I… I can't let go!

1084
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,958
-Get back! Get back! Get back!

1085
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,125
-Who is she?

1086
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:15,125
A hundred years since I failed.

1087
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,375
A hundred years of granting wishes.

1088
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:20,541
You were the first to wish to free me,

1089
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:22,500
to wish me home.

1090
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:25,375
Thank you.

1091
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,583
-Run. Run!

1092
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:51,333
Run! Go, go, go!

1093
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,500
Run! Run!

1094
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,875
Run! Run!
Agatha, get out of there!

1095
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:04,041
Get up!

1096
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:06,791
Get up!

1097
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,083
Gregor?

1098
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,083
Hey, Gregor.

1099
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,041
-No, don't! Get back from it!
-Gregor!

1100
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:24,416
Hey, Gregor, I don't know
if I can help you or not.

1101
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,708
But if I can, I will.

1102
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:35,541
-I've got you!

1103
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,166
-Don't worry, Agatha!

1104
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:54,791
-You okay?

1105
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:56,916
What did you do?

1106
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:58,833
That was my friend!

1107
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,000
It was about to kill you!
I've just saved your life!

1108
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,791
You pompous ass, you killed him!

1109
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:05,458
-No!
-No! Tedros was rescuing you!

1110
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,125
Everyone, back to your dorms!

1111
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,250
Classes are canceled
for the rest of the day.

1112
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:10,750
You, come with me. Go!

1113
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:13,333
-Go, go, go!

1114
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:16,416
Gregor, I'm so sorry.

1115
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,125
-Agatha--
-Stop!

1116
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,708
That's what you call Good?

1117
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,500
Destroying someone kind

1118
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:26,791
because they can't live up
to your impossible expectations?

1119
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,541
What exactly is good about that?

1120
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:33,083
Agatha, everyone has a role to play here.
In time, you will understand.

1121
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,458
No, I won't.

1122
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,083
I told you, I don't belong here.

1123
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,791
What is wrong with you?

1124
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:44,166
Once upon a time, Good was real and true.

1125
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,458
Now we are in the age
of self-centered perfectionism,

1126
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:52,166
but you used your wish
to save that poor girl.

1127
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:55,333
Do you remember when I told you
that magic follows emotion?

1128
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:00,208
The most powerful emotion is empathy.

1129
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:05,041
The passion you've shown
tells me that you,

1130
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:09,375
young lady, are exactly where you belong.

1131
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:16,000
You are the first real princess
this school has seen

1132
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:20,791
in a long, long time.

1133
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,541
We have to talk.

1134
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,791
Did you give Tedros my letter?

1135
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:43,291
Yes, but something very bad
is going on here.

1136
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:44,333
Yeah, tell me about it.

1137
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:46,416
I just got visited by a swarm of bees

1138
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,416
that is apparently the most Evil man
in the world.

1139
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,916
Some guy named Rafal.

1140
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,458
That's the guy I saw. No, no, Sophie.
We have to get out now, kiss or no kiss.

1141
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:54,916
No, wait. What did Tedros say?

1142
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,500
He said your friend had
one hell of a right hook.

1143
01:14:57,583 --> 01:15:00,041
Oh no. What happened to your eye?

1144
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:02,000
Uh, ask your friend.

1145
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,166
You hit him?

1146
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,416
Aggie, why?

1147
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,125
I just had the nerve
to save her life, you know.

1148
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:11,291
Just meet me outside when you're finished
doing whatever you have to do.

1149
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:15,833
-So sorry.

1150
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:21,625
She can be temperamental…
and violent, apparently. 

1151
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,708
Sophie, right?

1152
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,833
Yeah.

1153
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:27,583
You write nice letters.

1154
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:29,625
I just didn't know how else to meet you.

1155
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:32,541
They keep us so separate here.

1156
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:36,208
Yeah, probably best
to keep Good and Evil apart. Less messy.

1157
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:39,666
That is, unless you're unlucky enough
to be trapped in the wrong school.

1158
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:43,000
-She's not in the wrong school.

1159
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:46,458
But she's definitely not supposed
to be talking to princes.

1160
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,500
-No!
-No, you don't need to drag her--

1161
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:50,916
Tedros, please!
I didn't do anything!

1162
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,333
-Hey. Hey.

1163
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,875
She's Evil, Teddy.
Let them take care of her.

1164
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,625
Where are you taking me?

1165
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,333
-The Doom Room.
-The what?

1166
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:07,250
No! I didn't do anything that bad!

1167
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:13,291
Which is precisely why you're down here.

1168
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,625
You.

1169
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,000
You, you, you.

1170
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,916
Whom Rafal has chosen above all others.

1171
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:27,541
You could be the savior
our school's been waiting for.

1172
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,750
But no.

1173
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:32,208
You waste your time being distracted

1174
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:35,291
by foolish Everboy <i>princes.</i>

1175
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,041
Please don't hurt me.

1176
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:40,333
-You've been given a great gift, Sophie.

1177
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:45,333
One I will not let you sabotage.

1178
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,083
The time has come…

1179
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:59,125
for you to admit which side you're on.

1180
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:07,083
Rafal only wants one who's truly Evil.

1181
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:14,791
It's clear your beauty
is keeping you and others

1182
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:18,833
-from accepting who you really are.

1183
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,541
No! No!

1184
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,875
Hey, meathead. Stop!

1185
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:38,666
Oh God, what did I do now?

1186
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,083
Apparently, you stood there
while one of the giant dogs

1187
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:42,875
dragged Sophie away screaming.

1188
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,666
Hey, I rescue princesses and defeat Evil.
I don't save it. Okay?

1189
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:46,875
You know who's Evil?

1190
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,125
Yes. Because it's literally
on the name of her school.

1191
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:51,125
Because I'm Good.
That's what I'm supposed to do.

1192
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,416
That's what I have to do, okay?

1193
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,625
-Start getting the concept of this place.
-No, I get it fine.

1194
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,000
And it's ridiculous.

1195
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:59,125
You know that Evil stymph you killed?

1196
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:02,291
Yeah, that was Gregor.

1197
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:07,208
-No, it wasn't. I would have known that.
-Mm, but you didn't.

1198
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:10,666
Are you sure?

1199
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:15,416
Ask Dovey. And then come back and tell me
how you know Evil when you see it.

1200
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,791
You know what?
Try thinking for yourself for a change,

1201
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:23,833
and you might see past the black and white
this school wants you to see.

1202
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:27,291
You might be surprised
by what you figure out.

1203
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:40,791
Why is this happening to me?

1204
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:45,333
Because it is your destiny.

1205
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,416
Rafal?

1206
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:00,041
You can be more than you ever dreamed
you could be, Sophie. After all…

1207
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:03,708
Always remember how special you are.

1208
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:08,333
You're gonna change the world someday.

1209
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:11,458
And you <i>are </i>special, Sophie.

1210
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,708
But they all refuse to see it.

1211
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,958
You've been honest, kind, patient,

1212
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:20,250
and did they admit you were Good?

1213
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:23,458
No.

1214
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,500
I'm the only one you can trust.

1215
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:28,208
Forget about their rules.

1216
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:32,291
Do what you want, when you want.

1217
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:35,791
And if they won't give you what's yours,

1218
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:38,083
take it.

1219
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:41,625
<i>Drawn in by Rafal's words,</i>

1220
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:46,875
<i>Sophie decided she would do</i>
<i>whatever it took to win Tedros</i>

1221
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:50,833
<i>-and gain true love's kiss.</i>

1222
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:55,750
Lose something?

1223
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,916
Or just looking for another face to punch?

1224
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:01,916
-Can't find Sophie.

1225
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,625
Just want to make sure she's okay.

1226
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,875
Well, I'm sure she won't miss this.

1227
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,458
Big day today.

1228
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:11,541
Both schools finally getting access
to their magic.

1229
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:16,291
Hey, you should know
some people are saying you're a witch.

1230
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:18,875
Yeah, I've heard that before.

1231
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:19,791
Well…

1232
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:24,333
For the record, I don't think you are.

1233
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:27,458
Yeah?

1234
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,791
Then what am I, hmm?

1235
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,250
I wish I knew.

1236
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,875
Because you're sure not like
anybody I've ever met before.

1237
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:53,458
I… I… can't do this.

1238
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,750
Do what? Uh, fall down?

1239
01:20:58,125 --> 01:20:59,625
Shut up!

1240
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:02,000
Everyone, find your seats.

1241
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,500
-Let's begin.
-Mm.

1242
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:08,208
To access one's magic,

1243
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:12,041
one must first unlock one's finger glow.

1244
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:14,875
Once you've mastered your finger glow,

1245
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:17,250
it will prove to be invaluable.

1246
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,333
I can't wait.

1247
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:23,833
They say some people can transform
into animals when they have their magic.

1248
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:27,333
I want to turn into a cat at night
so I can sleep under a stove.

1249
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,791
Oh, it'd be so warm.

1250
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,083
Shall we?

1251
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,708
Have no fear, Evers.

1252
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:43,041
Good feels no pain.

1253
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:49,166
-Nevers…

1254
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,958
…it's going to hurt.

1255
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:53,000
-Oh good.
-Ugh.

1256
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,208
Line up!

1257
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:56,000
-Me first!

1258
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:00,166
Hey! Let me through!

1259
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,875
No way! Me first!

1260
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,208
-Beautiful.

1261
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,125
Stop.

1262
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:25,375
Your finger glow helps you become aware
of the power inside you.

1263
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:26,666
Ooh!

1264
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,291
Ow, ow, ow!

1265
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,500
Thank you, ma'am.

1266
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,791
When your finger glows, it means
you've begun to tap into emotions

1267
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,666
-powerful enough…

1268
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,708
-…to cast a spell.

1269
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:45,833
The stronger your feelings…

1270
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,708
…the stronger your magic.

1271
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:01,500
I hope I'm not late.

1272
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,541
What is this all about?

1273
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:25,541
This? Turns out you did me a favor.

1274
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,375
I was long overdue for a makeover.

1275
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:33,208
Now, if you wouldn't mind
activating my powers,

1276
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:34,541
I'd be most grateful.

1277
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:42,541
Hm.

1278
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:47,083
Thank you.

1279
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:19,166
Truce?

1280
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:21,833
Now, who wants a facial?

1281
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:24,916
Draw!

1282
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,958
Heh.

1283
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:59,500
And whether Good or Evil,
beauty is a full-time job.

1284
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:02,791
We need to talk.

1285
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:06,291
-About?

1286
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:07,458
Oh!

1287
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,291
I have it under control.

1288
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,750
I don't think you do.

1289
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,666
So I'm supposed to take romantic advice

1290
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,750
from a girl who used to make
phlegm sculptures?

1291
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:28,958
Why are you acting like this?

1292
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,791
Because I'm tired of being
pathetic little Sophie.

1293
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:34,500
The girl who defended me
with a frying pan wasn't pathetic.

1294
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,083
Well, I like the new me.

1295
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,375
Okay, what's with the book?

1296
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:46,166
Tedros's father chose his bride,
Guinevere, for her beauty,

1297
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,375
but then she betrayed him with Lancelot.

1298
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,833
King Arthur lost his throne
and died of a broken heart.

1299
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:54,000
And this is supposed to be, what?

1300
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:56,166
-Date conversation?
-Don't you get it?

1301
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,958
After what happened to his father,

1302
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:01,291
Tedros isn't going to fall for someone
just because she's hot.

1303
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,666
You need to prove to him that you're Good,

1304
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,791
in front of everybody,
in a way no one can deny.

1305
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:14,458
Fine.

1306
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:17,833
What do I have to do?

1307
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:21,916
Good shot.

1308
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:31,750
-Hi.

1309
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,625
Sorry. Didn't mean to distract you.

1310
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:37,375
Heh. Nothing distracts me.

1311
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,625
Then maybe I'm just good luck.

1312
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:44,208
Don't flatter yourself.

1313
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:45,583
It's prince's code.

1314
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:48,000
Your arrow flies straight
if you're pure of heart.

1315
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,375
What do you think
you're doing?

1316
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:58,958
Where I come from,
girls are allowed to do anything boys do.

1317
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:00,916
It's got nothing to do
with you being a girl.

1318
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,625
-Hmm?
-Nevers can't shoot.

1319
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,750
The whole lack of pure heart and all.

1320
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:08,125
I told you, I am not a Never.

1321
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,708
Oh, please, not a Never.

1322
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,625
Keep your elbow tight.

1323
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:17,375
Extend this and relax the grip.

1324
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,458
It helps if you focus on the target.

1325
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,375
Take it away.

1326
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:52,666
Hmm.

1327
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:55,083
Never doubted you for a minute.

1328
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:59,541
Do you wanna hang out?

1329
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:02,291
I don't know. With who?

1330
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:05,916
Just some prince
who wants to get to know you better.

1331
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:11,916
You're up.

1332
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:21,875
Traitors.

1333
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:23,375
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1334
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:26,041
Ugh. I don't know what she sees in him.

1335
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:28,041
It's an affront to us all.

1336
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:29,125
It's not right.

1337
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:31,041
I hate to say it.

1338
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:32,541
This is bad.

1339
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,750
She's mine.

1340
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,333
Or ours.

1341
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,500
She's a Never!

1342
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,750
-It's bloody disgusting.
-We should eat them.

1343
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:44,875
They've been together all day.

1344
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:47,250
So tragic.

1345
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:58,125
You do know that no one's
ever wanting to see us together.

1346
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:00,291
I do.

1347
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:02,291
And me being with someone
who they think's a Never

1348
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,791
is gonna send the entire school
into chaos.

1349
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:06,083
I'd survive.

1350
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:09,666
And they're all gonna lose their minds
when I take you to the Evers Ball.

1351
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,833
What?

1352
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:13,541
-Teddy, you promise?
-Of course.

1353
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,041
What?

1354
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,250
No.

1355
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:31,041
You are not taking
that underdressed she-wolf instead of me.

1356
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:34,166
One of you, do something.

1357
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:36,583
Hmm.

1358
01:29:36,666 --> 01:29:37,791
-Shh.

1359
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:43,958
-Going somewhere?

1360
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:47,041
-Down your throat!

1361
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,166
-Come on!

1362
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:57,500
Stop!

1363
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,625
-Stop it!

1364
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:07,041
Why? Why are we still entertaining
this preposterous--

1365
01:30:07,125 --> 01:30:08,541
Please! Please! Please!

1366
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:13,666
Dating between Evers and Nevers
is strictly against the rules.

1367
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,041
-Thank you.
-Yes!

1368
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:18,333
Evil and Good do not belong together.

1369
01:30:18,416 --> 01:30:20,750
It's rep… repulsive.

1370
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,000
Sir, if I may.

1371
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,583
I'm responsible for choosing Camelot's
next queen.

1372
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,125
I do not take that decision lightly.

1373
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,833
I chose Sophie because she <i>is </i>Good.
She's just in the wrong school.

1374
01:30:28,916 --> 01:30:30,833
If he believes it, why can't you?

1375
01:30:30,916 --> 01:30:33,666
Besides, nothing can keep true love apart.

1376
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,583
Isn't that, like,
the first rule of fairy tales?

1377
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:39,583
If it is <i>true</i> love,

1378
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,708
such a thing would certainly be momentous.

1379
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:47,541
It seems to me
there's only one way to be sure.

1380
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,750
A Trial by Tale!

1381
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:51,958
-What? No!
-But sir!

1382
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:53,041
Sir, I accept.

1383
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:55,916
Uh…

1384
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Sorry. What is a Trial by Tale?

1385
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:04,083
Each of you have to enter the Blue Forest
on opposite sides.

1386
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:07,083
You have to defeat
whatever danger presents itself

1387
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:08,375
and find each other by dawn.

1388
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:10,916
Help, strictly forbidden.

1389
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,958
Sophie, we can do this.

1390
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:15,916
We're good enough
and strong enough to protect each other.

1391
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:18,791
-We can do this.
-What?

1392
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:21,583
This will get them <i>both</i> killed!

1393
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:24,000
The trial shall begin…

1394
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:27,083
…at sundown.

1395
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:40,125
<i>Tedros of Camelot.</i>

1396
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,208
<i>Sophie of Gavaldon.</i>

1397
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:46,625
A Trial by Tale
is not to be taken lightly.

1398
01:31:56,041 --> 01:32:00,500
<i>Mortal danger lurks</i>
<i>beyond the school's gates.</i>

1399
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,583
Do you still wish to proceed?

1400
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:04,625
I do.

1401
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,500
Yes.

1402
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:08,166
Definitely.

1403
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,791
<i>If you wish to give up,</i>

1404
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:21,833
<i>drop the red handkerchief on the ground,</i>
<i>and you will be transported to safety.</i>

1405
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:26,458
-Let the trial begin.

1406
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,916
Tedros?

1407
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,583
-Hello?

1408
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:05,250
I'm over here!

1409
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,041
I'm ready to be saved!

1410
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,250
Aww.

1411
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:15,458
Flowers. Pretty.

1412
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:16,833
Let's stick to pretty.

1413
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:31,041
-Hello, my little friends.

1414
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:34,083
We're all so beautiful.

1415
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:36,041
It's me.

1416
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,833
Help!

1417
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:56,916
No!

1418
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:04,916
Tedros, help!

1419
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:07,541
Tedros!

1420
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:09,916
Tedros?

1421
01:34:12,916 --> 01:34:14,750
Tedros, where are you?

1422
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:25,833
Okay.

1423
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:28,583
Pumpkins are fun.

1424
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,416
Tedros, help!

1425
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,000
Tedros!

1426
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:04,708
-Sophie, come on! Go, go, go!

1427
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,541
-Go!

1428
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:09,041
Sophie!

1429
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:12,208
-Sophie!
-It's okay. Okay.

1430
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,708
Go to him. Once he saves you, kiss him,
and then we can get out of this madhouse.

1431
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:17,375
-Okay? Go.

1432
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:20,875
-Sophie!
-Tedros!

1433
01:35:22,916 --> 01:35:24,875
Oh, Tedros, thank God.

1434
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:29,125
-No!

1435
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,541
Sophie, grab Excalibur.

1436
01:36:02,291 --> 01:36:03,250
Help him.

1437
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:19,833
-Sophie! Toss my sword, now!

1438
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,916
-Sophie, do something!

1439
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:51,833
What are you doing here?

1440
01:36:54,583 --> 01:36:56,083
You! You cheated!

1441
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:57,666
-You brought Agatha!
-No!

1442
01:36:58,458 --> 01:36:59,791
No, I came on my own. I swear.

1443
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:01,875
-Yeah.
-You knew she wouldn't help me.

1444
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:03,666
-That's not true.
-That's not fair.

1445
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:07,291
Everyone knows the prince saves
the princess, not the other way around.

1446
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:11,458
-I can't change the world if I'm dead.

1447
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:12,833
And I thought you were Good.

1448
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:13,791
No.

1449
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,750
No, no, no. No, no. <i>No!</i>

1450
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
You.

1451
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:22,416
<i>You</i> did this.

1452
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,916
I… I was just trying to help.

1453
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:27,833
Sophie, you know
you'd both be dead right now if I hadn't.

1454
01:37:27,916 --> 01:37:30,000
Liar. You knew this would happen.

1455
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:34,125
First, you steal my school,
and now you're trying to steal my prince.

1456
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,916
How can you say that? I…
Sophie, I'm your best friend.

1457
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,250
A princess can't be friends with a witch.

1458
01:38:02,666 --> 01:38:04,166
Oh!

1459
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:05,416
Where have you been?

1460
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,708
Trying to talk to Sophie,
but they locked her in her room.

1461
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:10,458
Yes, they locked her in
because she broke the rules.

1462
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:11,833
You both did.

1463
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:15,083
Why? Why did you help her in the trial?

1464
01:38:15,166 --> 01:38:17,250
Did you not think
she could do it on her own?

1465
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:21,916
I thought that you believed
that Sophie was truly Good.

1466
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:23,583
I don't.

1467
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:27,166
I don't believe that anyone
is truly Good or truly Evil,

1468
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,250
because people are complicated,

1469
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:31,541
even if everybody in this place
pretends they aren't.

1470
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:32,541
Young lady.

1471
01:38:32,625 --> 01:38:35,833
-The rules of this school must be--
-Must be obeyed.

1472
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:39,791
You keep saying that,
but what good are your rules

1473
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:43,250
if you don't do anything about it
when actual, dangerous Evil is here?

1474
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:44,458
Please!

1475
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:48,375
Sophie is many, many things,
but I would hardly call her dangerous.

1476
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:50,000
Not Sophie. Rafal!

1477
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:54,958
What did you just say?

1478
01:38:55,041 --> 01:38:57,416
Rafal. I saw him again in the forest,

1479
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,500
but clearly, none of you
have done anything about it.

1480
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:03,000
"Again"?
What does that mean?

1481
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:05,750
Have you seen Rafal before? Here?

1482
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:06,958
Yeah.

1483
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:09,750
In the tower of blood
I told the School Master about.

1484
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,750
And Sophie saw him in her classroom.

1485
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:14,833
So did Lady Lesso. Didn't she tell you?

1486
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,875
Lesso.

1487
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,958
I should have known.

1488
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,916
Come with me.
We will get to the bottom of this.

1489
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,750
Come on. Go!

1490
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:31,500
Sophie?

1491
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:33,041
Um…

1492
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:37,166
…Agatha asked me to give you this.

1493
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,291
I…

1494
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:42,208
I hope you feel better soon.

1495
01:39:45,083 --> 01:39:48,708
<i>Dear Sophie, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>for what happened in the forest.</i>

1496
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:50,583
<i>I never meant to hurt you.</i>

1497
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:51,791
<i>But whatever's going on,</i>

1498
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:54,291
<i>it's more than you getting a kiss</i>
<i>from a prince.</i>

1499
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,583
<i>I saw Rafal in the woods.</i>

1500
01:39:56,666 --> 01:40:00,083
<i>I think what's happening here</i>
<i>is bigger than anyone realizes.</i>

1501
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:03,041
<i>It's true Evil,</i>
<i>and we have to stick together.</i>

1502
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:05,500
-<i>Only trust each other.</i>

1503
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,000
<i>We're best friends.</i>

1504
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:10,083
<i>You must know,</i>
<i>no matter what, I'm on your side.</i>

1505
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:13,208
<i>-All my love, Aggie.</i>

1506
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:17,000
Don't tell me
you actually believe that.

1507
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
It's a lie.

1508
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:23,625
And besides, that prince
wasn't good enough for you anyway.

1509
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:25,166
You're back?

1510
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:29,000
-But I thought--
-I'd left you? Never.

1511
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:32,458
Even if everyone else has betrayed you.

1512
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:36,375
-Aggie hasn't.
-No?

1513
01:40:36,458 --> 01:40:38,416
-See for yourself.

1514
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:42,750
I thought you believed
that Sophie was truly Good.

1515
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:44,958
I don't.

1516
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:50,416
-She's been lying to you, Sophie.

1517
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,916
Working against you
from the very beginning.

1518
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,208
She means to drag you
back to that miserable little village.

1519
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:00,750
But I'll protect you.

1520
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,125
I'll help you.

1521
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:09,875
Don't be scared.

1522
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:16,083
Think of yourself as a caterpillar
about to transform into a butterfly.

1523
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:17,458
Very soon,

1524
01:41:17,541 --> 01:41:21,958
you'll emerge more beautiful
and more powerful than ever.

1525
01:41:22,833 --> 01:41:26,625
A queen unlike this school has ever seen.

1526
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:32,791
I can give you abilities
they only dream of.

1527
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:35,083
You'll not just be
the fairest of them all,

1528
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:38,333
you'll be the strongest.

1529
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:43,041
Blood magic, Sophie.

1530
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,041
My love…

1531
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,916
…will you accept

1532
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:53,541
this gift?

1533
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:55,708
-I will.

1534
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:04,125
You knew Rafal was here,
in the school, and you told no one?

1535
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:07,041
Ah, must have slipped my mind.

1536
01:42:07,125 --> 01:42:12,458
I see! The soul of wickedness itself
just slipped your mind, Lesso?

1537
01:42:12,541 --> 01:42:15,791
I'm the Dean of the School for <i>Evil.</i>

1538
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,750
Does that suggest anything to you?

1539
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:19,833
Yeah, it suggests
that nobody in charge here knows

1540
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:21,375
what's going on in this stupid place.

1541
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:24,083
-Quiet, Reader!
-Or what? You'll fail me for frowning?

1542
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:26,125
Now, what does Rafal want with Sophie?

1543
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:28,625
For Evil to finally win!

1544
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:30,208
That's what.

1545
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:31,958
That's what you think will happen?

1546
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:34,000
Rafal won't help Evil win.

1547
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:37,291
When he tried to kill the School Master,
his own brother,

1548
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:40,375
his goal was to destroy the school,
both schools,

1549
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:43,041
so that he can keep
all the magic in the world to himself.

1550
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:46,333
Thank you so much, beauty teacher.

1551
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:50,666
Hey, I was the head
of the Magical History Department

1552
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:52,458
long before you got here, Red.

1553
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:54,125
-You were?
-Yes!

1554
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,416
Before this place
became insufferably shallow

1555
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,750
and I was demoted to beautification.

1556
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:01,333
Do I look like I give a shit
about smiling?

1557
01:43:01,416 --> 01:43:03,250
Okay, then we have to protect Sophie.

1558
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,458
-And we will, as soon as we find her.

1559
01:43:05,541 --> 01:43:06,958
Sophie is missing.

1560
01:43:07,958 --> 01:43:09,375
-And Anemone is right.
-Oh.

1561
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:13,083
Rafal will destroy this entire school
if he joins forces with Sophie.

1562
01:43:13,166 --> 01:43:14,000
Lies.

1563
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:16,125
All lies!

1564
01:43:16,208 --> 01:43:18,750
This is just another ploy
to have Good win again.

1565
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,000
Trust me, it's not.

1566
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:23,166
If my brother is back from the dead,

1567
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:27,708
there is a good chance
none of us will survive, Lady Lesso.

1568
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:29,083
None of us.

1569
01:43:29,166 --> 01:43:31,416
Go find Sophie now. Search both schools.

1570
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:32,916
Yes, of course.

1571
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:35,875
And Agatha.

1572
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:38,625
Go to the Evers Ball.

1573
01:43:38,708 --> 01:43:42,875
Sophie may very well show there.
If she does, bring her to me.

1574
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:44,958
Now, go.

1575
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,791
"Living doll."

1576
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:12,500
-Sophie?

1577
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:14,875
Sophie.

1578
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:17,125
You're not… Oh my God.

1579
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:19,250
What has Rafal done to you?

1580
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:22,458
Taught me to accept
who I truly am, that's what.

1581
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:24,000
Isn't that what you wanted?

1582
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,375
I am a thing of beauty, am I not?

1583
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:31,000
The poison apple to Rafal's eye.

1584
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:34,708
The one whose talents
soar above all others.

1585
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:37,958
Please don't tell me
you're jealous.

1586
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:41,416
Leonora of Gavaldon.

1587
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:43,583
Rafal told me.

1588
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:48,833
Leonora, the lonely Reader
who wanted to be so much more.

1589
01:44:48,916 --> 01:44:50,875
He saw something in you.

1590
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:53,250
An Evil you didn't know you had.

1591
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:56,000
<i>-And so he brought you here to nurture it.</i>

1592
01:44:56,083 --> 01:45:00,458
<i>You tried so hard,</i>
<i>but you weren't Evil enough for him.</i>

1593
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:03,875
So he turned his back on you,
despite your love for him.

1594
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,750
And you've been trying
to prove yourself to him ever since…

1595
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:10,916
…hoping to win him over.

1596
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:16,208
But then along comes Sophie.

1597
01:45:17,916 --> 01:45:19,333
What has he promised you?

1598
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:23,000
And what have you promised him?

1599
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:24,750
Oh.

1600
01:45:25,666 --> 01:45:27,541
You're both such dolls to ask.

1601
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:34,125
-Sophie…

1602
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,916
-My God.

1603
01:46:14,083 --> 01:46:16,166
I was worried you wouldn't come
without an invite.

1604
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,958
But then I thought, "You know Agatha.
She does what she wants."

1605
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,125
Tedros, have you seen Sophie?

1606
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,750
Look, for once,
can we talk about something else?

1607
01:46:24,833 --> 01:46:26,333
Like what happened in the forest?

1608
01:46:26,416 --> 01:46:28,791
-That was--
-Yes, later. Once I've found her.

1609
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:30,125
She yells at you,

1610
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:33,083
she disrespects you, she blames you
for everything wrong in her life,

1611
01:46:33,166 --> 01:46:34,958
yet all you do is help her.

1612
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:37,625
Come on, why do you even think
she deserves saving?

1613
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:42,291
Look, back in Gavaldon, all my life,
they've called me a witch.

1614
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,291
They told me to my face how ugly I am

1615
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:47,666
and how someday they'll get around
to burning me and my mom.

1616
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,833
And the whole village just laughs,

1617
01:46:50,833 --> 01:46:52,291
except for Sophie.

1618
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:57,041
She's the only one who has stood up for me
from the time we were kids.

1619
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:58,666
She's like my sister,

1620
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,916
and I'm not someone
who gives up on family.

1621
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,250
Not ever.

1622
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:04,791
No, you're… you're right.

1623
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:08,458
No one should ever give up on family.

1624
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:10,791
Agatha, you saved me from that reaper,

1625
01:47:10,875 --> 01:47:13,625
and you made me want to see the world
in more than just black and white.

1626
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:16,166
And no one has ever done
anything like that for me before.

1627
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:18,583
And it made me realize

1628
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,375
<i>you</i> are my true love.

1629
01:47:20,458 --> 01:47:23,541
-Oh my God, you've got the worst timing.
-No, really.

1630
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:26,291
I've thought it through,
and I… I love you, Agatha.

1631
01:47:26,375 --> 01:47:27,791
Tedros, please, please stop.

1632
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:31,333
Rafal is using Sophie
to take down the schools.

1633
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:33,500
Uh, wait, who's Rafal?

1634
01:47:52,625 --> 01:47:54,458
Sophie, what happened to you?

1635
01:47:57,666 --> 01:47:59,416
-My God.
-Don't worry, Teddy.

1636
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,416
Should clear up by tomorrow.

1637
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,375
Try to look past it
and not ruin our evening.

1638
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:06,750
The Evers Ball!

1639
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:08,875
Ah!

1640
01:48:08,958 --> 01:48:09,958
Here I am.

1641
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:13,000
You're taking <i>me, </i>remember?

1642
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:16,000
-You promised.
-Sophie, please.

1643
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:18,666
Quiet, Aggie.
The protagonists are speaking.

1644
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:21,916
-I'm still your date, right?

1645
01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:24,916
You going back on your promise?

1646
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,166
Because…

1647
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,791
bad things happen…

1648
01:48:28,875 --> 01:48:30,750
…when the Good
break their promises.

1649
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:32,875
There is no promise.

1650
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:35,041
You betrayed me. I'm here with Agatha.

1651
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:37,666
-No. Whoa, no. He's not.
-Liar.

1652
01:48:49,541 --> 01:48:52,000
You know, I think
I'm really getting the hang of this.

1653
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:53,291
Sophie, stop.

1654
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:57,416
-Whatever's happened, I can help you.

1655
01:48:58,666 --> 01:48:59,625
I'm your friend.

1656
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:01,083
No, Agatha.

1657
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,625
You're my nemesis.

1658
01:49:03,708 --> 01:49:08,541
Which means our story can't end
until one of us is destroyed.

1659
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:12,750
Sophie.

1660
01:49:18,791 --> 01:49:19,791
Bye.

1661
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:36,458
-Tedros.

1662
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:38,083
Come quick.

1663
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:55,333
So, does this mean the ball is canceled?

1664
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:56,666
We have to stop her.

1665
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,500
No, no, no. Nobody hurt Sophie.

1666
01:49:58,583 --> 01:49:59,833
Look at what she's done.

1667
01:49:59,916 --> 01:50:02,083
Our only hope is to kill her
before she destroys us all.

1668
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:04,416
Men, grab your weapons.

1669
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,166
-It's time to kill the witch!
-Stop!

1670
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:08,666
Evil attacks, Good defends, remember?

1671
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:10,000
You can't attack!

1672
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:02,708
My dear Nevers!

1673
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:06,583
We have guests.

1674
01:51:06,666 --> 01:51:08,625
-How should we greet them?

1675
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:09,541
We'll kill 'em!

1676
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:12,791
Just leave them alone!

1677
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,875
Sophie, please. They were just scared
you were going to attack them.

1678
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:17,750
Now, why would we ever do that?

1679
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:21,500
That would be such an Evil thing to do.

1680
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:28,041
Let's show them
how Good we really are.

1681
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:30,333
-Let's dance.

1682
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:37,083
-Say hello to our guests.

1683
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:39,875
Here's some party favors, boys.

1684
01:51:39,958 --> 01:51:40,833
Draw!

1685
01:51:40,916 --> 01:51:42,541
Tedros, it's a trick!

1686
01:51:42,625 --> 01:51:44,250
-Kill the witch!

1687
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:46,250
Fire!

1688
01:51:55,291 --> 01:51:56,125
Well, now.

1689
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:01,041
If Evil attacks and Good defends,

1690
01:52:01,125 --> 01:52:02,833
then it would appear

1691
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:05,500
that Good has become Evil.

1692
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:11,125
-And Evil has become Good.

1693
01:52:11,208 --> 01:52:13,583
Oh, so Good.

1694
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:10,791
Get out, Tedros!

1695
01:53:13,875 --> 01:53:17,250
-Teddy, we have so much to talk about.

1696
01:53:18,416 --> 01:53:22,000
You and your little army just tried
to kill a roomful of innocent people.

1697
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:26,250
Now that is quite Evil indeed.

1698
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:02,708
Looks like someone's
been auditing Uglification.

1699
01:54:04,375 --> 01:54:07,125
-No!

1700
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:08,500
Please, Sophie.

1701
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:10,750
You have to stop this!

1702
01:54:10,833 --> 01:54:11,916
It's too late.

1703
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:13,666
They attacked.

1704
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:15,125
Now we defend!

1705
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:42,500
Stop!

1706
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:55,125
Who wants hot chocolate?

1707
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:19,166
Call yourself a prince, Teddy?

1708
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:27,958
No!

1709
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:48,041
Ooh.

1710
01:55:50,416 --> 01:55:53,291
-Aww!

1711
01:56:13,375 --> 01:56:14,916
No, listen! Wait!

1712
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,708
Just listen to me!

1713
01:56:43,458 --> 01:56:44,625
Yeah!

1714
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:03,750
Coming, my queen!

1715
01:57:04,875 --> 01:57:06,833
-Whoo!

1716
01:57:06,916 --> 01:57:08,208
No! Tedros!

1717
01:57:08,291 --> 01:57:11,708
That felt wonderful.
Been dying to do that all semester.

1718
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:14,000
Tedros! Oh, Tedros! No!

1719
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,708
Back off, Aggie!

1720
01:57:19,125 --> 01:57:20,583
This is my happy ending.

1721
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:23,625
So this is how you change the world?

1722
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:27,250
This is what you've always wanted?
To simply have it all at your feet?

1723
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:32,250
Yup. The only mistake I made
was thinking I needed to switch schools.

1724
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:35,375
It was just the schools
that needed to switch.

1725
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:38,791
The mistake you made
was thinking you needed any of this.

1726
01:57:39,416 --> 01:57:40,916
Look what it's done to you!

1727
01:57:42,083 --> 01:57:44,875
Look at what it has done to <i>us.</i>

1728
01:57:44,958 --> 01:57:47,125
Sophie, Rafal is the enemy.

1729
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:48,916
-We have to defeat him.

1730
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,416
-I'd rather defeat my nemesis.

1731
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:53,666
Sophie, don't!

1732
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:55,583
No! No! Oh my--

1733
01:57:55,666 --> 01:57:56,791
Sophie!

1734
01:57:58,916 --> 01:58:03,541
Now…
just one last score to settle.

1735
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:20,166
-School Master.

1736
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:22,000
Where are you, old man?

1737
01:58:22,875 --> 01:58:24,291
Time to pay for your mistake!

1738
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:25,958
Seeking revenge,

1739
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:27,750
Sophie searched the tower

1740
01:58:27,833 --> 01:58:31,666
for the one person
who had wronged her from the start.

1741
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:34,083
Or so she believed.

1742
01:58:34,875 --> 01:58:36,166
What does that mean?

1743
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:40,666
It means your tale has just begun,
Sophie of Gavaldon.

1744
01:58:43,833 --> 01:58:44,833
Rafal.

1745
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:48,583
This was all a test, Sophie.

1746
01:58:49,166 --> 01:58:50,333
All of it.

1747
01:58:50,416 --> 01:58:53,791
A test… to find my true love.

1748
01:58:55,125 --> 01:58:56,291
I don't understand.

1749
01:58:56,375 --> 01:59:00,333
I was the one who answered your wish
and brought you here.

1750
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:05,958
The seers told me of your potential,
and I wanted to help you fulfill it.

1751
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:07,583
Who else has believed in you…

1752
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,750
cared for you,

1753
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,166
defended you,

1754
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:16,333
given you everything?

1755
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,166
When you use that power,

1756
01:59:20,916 --> 01:59:23,125
and watch your enemies fall,

1757
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:26,666
how does it feel?

1758
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:29,041
-I like it.

1759
01:59:30,083 --> 01:59:32,125
You were never meant for Good.

1760
01:59:32,208 --> 01:59:33,666
And of course, neither was I.

1761
01:59:35,916 --> 01:59:38,166
Why did you pose as the School Master?

1762
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:39,916
<i>He was my brother.</i>

1763
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,625
<i>Centuries ago,</i>

1764
01:59:42,125 --> 01:59:44,958
we were entrusted the Storian for eternity

1765
01:59:45,041 --> 01:59:48,625
because our bond
overrode our warring souls.

1766
01:59:48,708 --> 01:59:53,625
As long as we protected each other,
we would stay immortal… and young.

1767
01:59:54,416 --> 01:59:58,625
Good and Evil, in perfect balance.

1768
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:01,166
But time…

1769
02:00:03,333 --> 02:00:05,791
time makes one discontent.

1770
02:00:06,375 --> 02:00:07,333
What happened to him?

1771
02:00:07,416 --> 02:00:09,958
<i>We fought…</i>

1772
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,833
<i>…</i>and I killed him.

1773
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:35,583
<i>You killed your brother?</i>

1774
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,125
How could you do that?

1775
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:43,458
Well, the same way
you tried to kill your beloved prince.

1776
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:46,333
Because it's who we are.

1777
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:48,458
After my brother's death,

1778
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:52,583
I assumed his identity
to hide my true intent.

1779
02:00:52,666 --> 02:00:54,708
<i>Started destroying the balance</i>
<i>from within.</i>

1780
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:59,458
There are no mistakes
in the School for Good and Evil.

1781
02:00:59,541 --> 02:01:01,833
But Good has won for 200 years.

1782
02:01:01,916 --> 02:01:04,666
Oh, have they now?

1783
02:01:05,166 --> 02:01:06,958
Story by story, I have corrupted them.

1784
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:10,583
Rewarding them for burning old ladies
in ovens,

1785
02:01:10,666 --> 02:01:12,666
making mermaids cut out their tongues,

1786
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:15,458
forcing women to dance
in red-hot iron shoes.

1787
02:01:16,166 --> 02:01:17,500
Good became vain.

1788
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:19,333
Foolish.

1789
02:01:21,416 --> 02:01:22,416
Weak.

1790
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:24,875
But you, Sophie?

1791
02:01:24,958 --> 02:01:26,375
You put me to shame.

1792
02:01:26,875 --> 02:01:29,583
You brought the whole school
to its knees in weeks.

1793
02:01:29,666 --> 02:01:32,250
Beyond Good and Evil, you…

1794
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:35,041
are chaos itself.

1795
02:01:35,541 --> 02:01:39,166
-And together, we are unstoppable.

1796
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:40,250
Agatha!

1797
02:01:40,333 --> 02:01:42,375
-Tedros?

1798
02:01:42,458 --> 02:01:43,458
Hey.

1799
02:01:45,875 --> 02:01:46,791
You all right?

1800
02:01:46,875 --> 02:01:49,083
Oh my God, I thought you were dead.

1801
02:01:49,166 --> 02:01:51,166
I'm fine. Listen to me.

1802
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:53,583
I need to put an end to the Nevers,
once and for all.

1803
02:01:53,666 --> 02:01:55,000
No, no, no, Tedros.

1804
02:01:55,083 --> 02:01:59,000
This whole war thing
between the schools, it's all wrong.

1805
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:01,250
-If I can get through to Sophie--
-After what she's done?

1806
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:02,833
No point. No way. It's not gonna work.

1807
02:02:02,916 --> 02:02:05,666
No, no, no. She's being used
by the School Master's brother.

1808
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:07,791
He's given her blood magic,
and it's too much for her.

1809
02:02:07,875 --> 02:02:10,333
-She doesn't know what she's doing.
-No, she knows.

1810
02:02:10,416 --> 02:02:11,916
I can reach her.

1811
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,166
-I know it.
-Listen to me.

1812
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:15,625
-What?
-She's gone.

1813
02:02:15,708 --> 02:02:18,250
She turned into a raven
and went up to the School Master's tower.

1814
02:02:19,125 --> 02:02:21,291
-What?
-The fight's down here, Agatha.

1815
02:02:21,958 --> 02:02:23,208
It's time to let her go.

1816
02:02:23,291 --> 02:02:26,041
Tedros, you told me
you were ready to see the world

1817
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:27,666
in more than just black and white.

1818
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:30,208
-Mm-hmm.
-This is your chance.

1819
02:02:30,291 --> 02:02:32,916
Please, I just need you to trust me.

1820
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,958
Come with me to save Sophie.
That is how we'll save the school.

1821
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:39,208
-Evers <i>and </i>Nevers.

1822
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:41,375
-Please.
-Tedros, help! We can't hold them.

1823
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:42,708
Okay. Go to her.

1824
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:45,250
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I promise you.

1825
02:02:47,916 --> 02:02:50,583
-And will you join me, Sophie?

1826
02:02:50,666 --> 02:02:53,250
All we need is our true love's kiss,

1827
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:57,083
Evil's kiss, to unlock our love

1828
02:02:57,166 --> 02:02:59,875
and forever open the gates to Never After

1829
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:03,666
for you and I…

1830
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:06,791
to rule.

1831
02:03:09,333 --> 02:03:11,333
I am your prince.

1832
02:03:13,416 --> 02:03:15,000
I am your true love.

1833
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:18,125
I always have been.

1834
02:03:20,333 --> 02:03:23,791
Will you join me?

1835
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:30,083
Yes. Yes.

1836
02:03:32,916 --> 02:03:38,083
And so it was that Evil
had finally won true love's kiss,

1837
02:03:38,166 --> 02:03:42,458
condemning both schools
and all those within their walls,

1838
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:44,458
Good and Evil alike,

1839
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:46,750
to perish in agony,

1840
02:03:46,833 --> 02:03:49,291
-allowing Rafal's Evil…
-Yes!

1841
02:03:49,375 --> 02:03:53,000
…true Evil, to overtake the world.

1842
02:03:53,083 --> 02:03:54,750
What have I done?

1843
02:03:54,833 --> 02:03:57,500
-Why does anyone have to die?

1844
02:03:57,583 --> 02:04:00,583
I thought you wanted Evil to win.
Those are my friends.

1845
02:04:00,666 --> 02:04:04,750
<i>They are merely fairy-tale Evil.</i>

1846
02:04:04,833 --> 02:04:08,750
<i>We must wipe the slate clean</i>
<i>to make way for true Evil.</i>

1847
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,333
Welcome to Never After, my love.

1848
02:04:28,416 --> 02:04:31,125
No! I didn't want to hurt them.

1849
02:04:31,208 --> 02:04:32,916
I thought you said we'd just rule them.

1850
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,708
And we <i>will</i> rule Never After,

1851
02:04:36,791 --> 02:04:38,625
where every one of those students,

1852
02:04:38,708 --> 02:04:40,125
every professor,

1853
02:04:40,208 --> 02:04:43,333
anyone who could challenge us, is dead.

1854
02:04:43,416 --> 02:04:47,375
Including… your nemesis.

1855
02:04:52,583 --> 02:04:53,583
Oh!

1856
02:04:54,958 --> 02:04:57,250
No, Aggie!

1857
02:04:58,083 --> 02:04:59,666
This is not what I wanted!

1858
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:02,166
Oh, it's too late for that now, Sophie.

1859
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,416
You've driven away everyone,

1860
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:09,083
lied to everyone, betrayed everyone.

1861
02:05:09,166 --> 02:05:11,125
You're all alone now.

1862
02:05:11,208 --> 02:05:13,083
That's why you're mine.

1863
02:05:13,166 --> 02:05:14,333
Get away from her!

1864
02:05:17,208 --> 02:05:18,416
Aggie!

1865
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:19,875
You're alive?

1866
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:23,916
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay. I got you.

1867
02:05:24,541 --> 02:05:27,583
You know, I expected more from a Reader.

1868
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:32,250
Surely you know
what happens to those who thwart love.

1869
02:05:32,333 --> 02:05:33,750
Love?

1870
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:35,625
This isn't love.

1871
02:05:35,708 --> 02:05:37,916
Do you know why Good always wins?

1872
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,625
Because we fight for each other,
and we care for each other.

1873
02:05:41,708 --> 02:05:44,083
<i>That</i> is what Good's love is.

1874
02:05:44,166 --> 02:05:46,333
Evil only fights for itself.

1875
02:05:47,791 --> 02:05:50,166
And that is the furthest thing
from love on Earth.

1876
02:05:51,875 --> 02:05:53,500
Such beautiful words

1877
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:57,291
that have no power or meaning anymore.

1878
02:05:57,375 --> 02:05:59,958
Now, if you'll please
step away from my bride.

1879
02:06:00,041 --> 02:06:02,791
You will never have her, you monster.

1880
02:06:03,791 --> 02:06:05,375
Not as long as I'm alive.

1881
02:06:05,958 --> 02:06:06,958
Oh.

1882
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:09,041
Well, as you wish.

1883
02:06:12,166 --> 02:06:14,416
-No! Not Aggie!

1884
02:06:16,541 --> 02:06:18,750
-Sophie!

1885
02:06:18,833 --> 02:06:21,166
-Sophie?

1886
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:24,458
-No. No!

1887
02:06:43,666 --> 02:06:44,583
It can't be.

1888
02:06:45,666 --> 02:06:47,208
Not after all this.

1889
02:07:03,083 --> 02:07:04,375
No.

1890
02:07:14,875 --> 02:07:17,375
-It's okay.

1891
02:07:19,416 --> 02:07:21,666
No. No, no, no.

1892
02:07:49,166 --> 02:07:52,583
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

1893
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:54,250
-In <i>my </i>school?

1894
02:07:55,875 --> 02:07:59,333
In your father's hands,
that sword might once have vanquished me.

1895
02:08:00,041 --> 02:08:04,333
But in the hands
of his ridiculous whelp of a son,

1896
02:08:04,416 --> 02:08:06,833
it is merely an oversized butter knife.

1897
02:08:26,291 --> 02:08:27,708
You think this tale…

1898
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:31,958
is about <i>your</i> true love.

1899
02:08:32,583 --> 02:08:35,708
No, it's about <i>mine.</i>

1900
02:08:39,791 --> 02:08:43,500
And the power Evil's kiss gave me

1901
02:08:43,583 --> 02:08:46,291
to kill Good's future king.

1902
02:08:46,375 --> 02:08:48,208
Or the tale of the girls who stopped you.

1903
02:09:30,125 --> 02:09:32,125
The end.

1904
02:09:35,375 --> 02:09:36,375
Oh my God.

1905
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,458
-Hey. Oh my God.

1906
02:09:41,541 --> 02:09:43,166
Oh my God. It's okay.

1907
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:45,125
Hey. Hi.

1908
02:09:46,708 --> 02:09:47,708
Aggie…

1909
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:51,541
I'm so sorry for everything.

1910
02:09:51,625 --> 02:09:54,333
Shh. You're fine. You're okay.

1911
02:09:55,041 --> 02:09:56,333
You're safe now.

1912
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:59,000
I don't wanna be Evil.

1913
02:09:59,083 --> 02:10:00,750
No, you are not Evil.

1914
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:03,416
You're just human.

1915
02:10:05,375 --> 02:10:06,875
As long as I have you.

1916
02:10:08,625 --> 02:10:10,375
We will always have each other.

1917
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:13,666
You promise?

1918
02:10:15,958 --> 02:10:16,958
I promise.

1919
02:10:17,458 --> 02:10:18,291
Good.

1920
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:25,458
I love you, Aggie.

1921
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:30,291
You'll always be… my best friend.

1922
02:10:34,083 --> 02:10:36,208
Hey. Hey.

1923
02:10:37,416 --> 02:10:38,416
No.

1924
02:10:42,083 --> 02:10:44,291
No, please come back.

1925
02:10:58,125 --> 02:10:59,500
I love you too.

1926
02:11:15,791 --> 02:11:16,791
Oh God.

1927
02:11:39,083 --> 02:11:40,291
Oh my God.

1928
02:11:41,583 --> 02:11:43,666
-Oh!

1929
02:11:52,291 --> 02:11:54,625
Hi. Hi.

1930
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:56,708
-Hi.
-Hey.

1931
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:00,291
Hey.

1932
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:08,791
Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

1933
02:12:08,875 --> 02:12:10,000
Oh my God.

1934
02:12:11,041 --> 02:12:13,041
Don't ever do that again.

1935
02:12:17,041 --> 02:12:18,041
Let's go home.

1936
02:12:20,375 --> 02:12:21,500
Yeah.

1937
02:12:21,583 --> 02:12:22,708
Let's go home.

1938
02:12:29,583 --> 02:12:35,125
And so it was that our heroes
defeated the greatest threat

1939
02:12:35,208 --> 02:12:39,541
the School for Good and Evil
had ever known.

1940
02:12:50,791 --> 02:12:54,625
<i>The world of fairy tales</i>
<i>had not perished,</i>

1941
02:12:55,333 --> 02:12:59,375
<i>but it had been changed forever.</i>

1942
02:12:59,458 --> 02:13:01,458
-Good and Evil together?

1943
02:13:02,625 --> 02:13:04,458
-One school?

1944
02:13:05,458 --> 02:13:06,416
Hmm.

1945
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:07,750
Now what?

1946
02:13:07,833 --> 02:13:10,708
Unity, perhaps.

1947
02:13:12,541 --> 02:13:16,250
Maybe… friendship, even.

1948
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:19,250
Hmm.

1949
02:13:23,958 --> 02:13:25,500
Mm.

1950
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:33,458
Well…

1951
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:37,708
-Well, no rush. No rush.
-No. Slow and steady wins the race.

1952
02:13:43,375 --> 02:13:44,250
Hi there.

1953
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:46,166
My heart belongs to another.

1954
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:02,833
<i>As for our two heroes,</i>
<i>there was finally a way back to Gavaldon,</i>

1955
02:14:02,916 --> 02:14:06,291
<i>as Agatha's kiss had set them free.</i>

1956
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:12,000
<i>For what is truer</i>
<i>than the love between friends?</i>

1957
02:14:12,083 --> 02:14:13,875
It's definitely best if I go.

1958
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,625
Aggie, if you want to stay here
with Tedros, I understand.

1959
02:14:23,125 --> 02:14:24,541
I'll take care of your mom.

1960
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:27,000
It would be my honor.

1961
02:14:28,375 --> 02:14:30,250
Thank you, Sophie.

1962
02:14:49,583 --> 02:14:51,958
-But I can't leave my friend.

1963
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:59,500
Thank you, Tedros, for wanting to change.

1964
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:05,000
I hope we'll see each other again someday.

1965
02:15:19,666 --> 02:15:21,708
Wait! Wait!

1966
02:15:55,375 --> 02:15:58,291
<i>Both girls were met with open arms…</i>

1967
02:16:00,708 --> 02:16:02,416
<i>…and open minds.</i>

1968
02:16:02,916 --> 02:16:05,541
<i>They never felt so special.</i>

1969
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,791
-Oh!
-Oh no!

1970
02:16:14,875 --> 02:16:17,791
-Hey!

1971
02:16:17,875 --> 02:16:20,750
<i>Although some things never change.</i>

1972
02:16:24,541 --> 02:16:26,833
-Witch! Witch!
-Burn! Witch!

1973
02:16:28,291 --> 02:16:32,041
<i>That is,</i>
<i>unless you use your power</i>

1974
02:16:32,125 --> 02:16:33,625
<i>to begin to change them.</i>

1975
02:16:41,583 --> 02:16:42,708
Ew!

1976
02:16:53,625 --> 02:16:57,541
<i>And that,</i>
<i>you could say, is the end of our story.</i>

1977
02:17:01,333 --> 02:17:07,250
<i>However, as Tedros's arrow</i>
<i>pierced the vortex between their worlds…</i>

1978
02:17:08,125 --> 02:17:11,083
<i>I need you, Agatha.</i>

1979
02:17:11,166 --> 02:17:15,083
<i>…it became clear</i>
<i>that this was only…</i>

1980
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:17,833
<i>…the beginning.</i>
