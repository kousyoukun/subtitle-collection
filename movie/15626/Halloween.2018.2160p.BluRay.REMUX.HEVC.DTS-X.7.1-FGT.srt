2
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:16,302
你不冷也没不舒服吧，是吗？
You're not cold or anything, are you?

3
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:18,304
一切都好吗？
Everything all right?

4
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:20,339
你在吃药吧？
Are you taking any medication?

5
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,410
嗯？
Hmm?

6
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:24,945
谢谢你
Thank you

7
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,580
你今早感觉如何？
How are you doing this morning?

8
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:28,815
昨晚你睡得安稳吗？
Did you have a restful sleep last night?

9
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:30,350
哦，是的
Oh, yeah

10
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:31,485
是吗？是的
You did? I did

11
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,320
有梦吗？没
Any dreams? Nope

12
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,855
有时候我们只是不记得自己的梦，你知道吧？
Sometimes we don't remember our dreams, you know?

13
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:35,856
没错
That's right

14
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:37,724
我们的确会做梦，但是我们起床后
We do dream, but we don't remember

15
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:39,559
就不记得了- 是的
when we wake up - NO

16
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,394
但是如果我们在要醒来时
But if we are dreaming some

17
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:43,563
正在梦着什么，我们就记得那些
just before we wake up, we remember those

18
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:44,698
没错
That's right

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,100
你知道吧
Did you know

20
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,635
一点~额~额~有用的信息
A little, uh uh, useful information

21
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:51,973
是啊，当我们醒来的时候
Yeah When we wake up

22
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,641
然后说，整个晚上，
and say, The whole night,

23
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,442
我做了什么什么梦
I was dreaming this and that and everything,

24
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:57,044
这梦最多只有45分钟
it's only 45 minutes maximum

25
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:00,114
你知道吗？- 对。不，我不知道这些。对
Did you know that? - Yeah. No, I did not. Yeah

26
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:03,050
所以普通的梦是十分钟或十五分钟
So the ordinary dream is ten or 15 minutes

27
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:04,819
待会儿见
I'll see you all later

28
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,355
你要去哪里？我要去看我的病人
Where are you going? I'm going to see my patients

29
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:08,623
测试。测试
Testing. Testing

30
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,991
检查，检查，检查一，二，三
Check, check, check One, two, three

31
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:11,592
测试。一，二，三

32
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:14,762
我们现在在史密斯森林
We are now at Smith's Grove,

33
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:16,865
呃，康复疗养院
uh, rehabilitation facility

34
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,901
我们今天来这里采访一个病人
We're here today to interview a patient

35
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:23,071
在过去的40年里被关在这
that's spent the last 40 years in captivity

36
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:26,542
而且，所有人都说说，他到现在一句话也没讲过
and, by all accounts, has not uttered a word

37
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:27,576
这个怪物
This monster

38
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:35,017
下午好下午好
Good afternoon Good afternoon

39
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,518
我是兰博・萨坦博士

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,986
很高兴终于见到你了

42
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:42,558
我们一直期待这个机会
We were hoping to have this opportunity

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,793
在他被转移到新医院之前
before he's transferred to the new facility

44
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,795
格拉斯山就不那么好说话了
Glass Hill is far less accommodating

45
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:48,697
格拉斯山简直就是地狱
Glass Hill is the pit of hell

46
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:51,433
多年来，他一直被留在这里做研究
For years, he's been kept here to be studied

47
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,468
我想国家已经对从他身上
I suppose the state has lost interest

48
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,671
有人么，救救我啊！求你了！
Somebody, please help me! Please!

救命！
Help!

65
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,285
因为我女儿没有打电话
Cause my daughter is not calling

66
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:04,619
这对你更安全
It's safer for you

67
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:05,687
她没有发短信来，凯伦，我们进去吧
She's not texting Come on, Karen, let's go inside

68
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:06,788
每个人都在找你的女儿
Everyone's looking for your daughter

69
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,158
让他们来处理吧所以不管你们谁在
Let them take care of it So whoever you had

70
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,292
找她，显然不能认出她
looking for her is obviously not able to identify her

71
01:12:10,294 --> 01:12:11,527
我们会找到你的女儿今天是万圣节
We're gonna find your daughter It's Halloween

72
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:12,328
我们会带她来 -这里到处都是孩子
We're gonna bring her here - There are kids everywhere

73
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,330
凯伦，来吧，没有办法
Karen, come on There is no way

74
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:16,065
凯伦。凯伦她有一套服装，你知道吗？
Karen. Karen She had a costume, you know?

75
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:18,134
我们需要进屋去，我们能调的人手都来了
We need to go in the house We have everybody available

76
01:12:18,136 --> 01:12:19,869
在过去的40年里，好吗？
In the last 40 years, okay?

77
01:12:19,871 --> 01:12:21,904
亲爱的，如果你让他们做他们的工作，他们会
Honey, if you let 'em do their job, they're gonna

78
01:12:21,906 --> 01:12:23,808
凯伦！
Karen!

79
01:12:29,147 --> 01:12:31,983
深呼吸，如果你愿意，我们可以打电话给你
Just breathe And if you want, we can call

80
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,221
待在车里，医生
Stay in the car, Doctor

81
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:40,023
你没事吧？深呼吸，亲爱的
You all right? Take deep breaths, sweetheart

82
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:41,291
他...他在街上好吗
He's... he's down the street Okay

83
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:43,493
好吧，他回来了。他杀了我的朋友
Okay He's back. He killed my friend

84
01:12:43,495 --> 01:12:46,029
一切都会好起来的。现在没事了
Everything's gonna be all right. It's okay

85
01:12:46,031 --> 01:12:47,397
深呼吸
Take a deep breath

86
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:49,766
我们会带你回到你妈妈身边，好吗？
We're gonna take you back to your mom, okay?

87
01:12:49,768 --> 01:12:51,735
我是医生。把门锁上
I'm a doctor. Lock your doors

88
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:54,237
各位，现在回到你们的房子，锁上门
Everybody, get back to your houses now and lock your doors

89
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,039
我们会带你去你妈那儿
We're gonna take you to your mom

90
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,908
不用怕他，不用怕他
Don't worry about him Don't worry about him

91
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,809
现在回到你们的房子里！
Back in your houses now!

92
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:01,312
你听到警官的话了吗
You heard the officer

93
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:03,880
这是怎么回事？回到你们的房子里！
What is going on? Back in your houses!

94
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:05,817
锁上门
Lock your goddamn doors

95
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:29,073
这是什么？
What's this?

96
01:13:29,075 --> 01:13:31,077
这是我的童年
It's my childhood

97
01:13:34,415 --> 01:13:36,115
我们走吧
Let's go

98
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:09,917
好吧，挑你的家伙吧
All right, pick your poison

99
01:14:11,052 --> 01:14:14,389
我喜欢左轮手枪，他们从不卡壳
I like a revolver They never jam

100
01:14:16,358 --> 01:14:19,194
这是“准确性和停止力”
This is accuracy and stopping power

101
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:22,528
这是“战术”
This is tactical

102
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:24,998
他一直在等今晚
He waited for this night

103
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
在等我
He's waited for me

104
01:14:27,002 --> 01:14:28,403
我一直在等他
I've waited for him

105
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:32,506
来吧，迈克尔
Come on, Michael

106
01:14:41,217 --> 01:14:43,384
艾莉森，睁大你的眼睛
Allyson, keep your eyes open

107
01:14:43,386 --> 01:14:45,252
他在外面的某个地方
He is out there somewhere

108
01:14:45,254 --> 01:14:47,421
嫌疑犯在圣公园11号在附近
Suspect reported on 11th, near Saint Park

109
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,490
收到，总台
Copy that, Dispatch

110
01:14:49,492 --> 01:14:51,427
我眼神很好
I got eyes

111
01:14:56,465 --> 01:14:58,299
看！是他！
Look! It's him!

112
01:14:58,301 --> 01:15:00,169
我们开始吧
Here we go

113
01:15:01,337 --> 01:15:02,439
振作起来
Brace yourselves

114
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:05,906
不要打他！
Don't hit him!

115
01:15:05,908 --> 01:15:07,511
小心！迈克尔！
Watch out! Michael!

116
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,117
不要开枪打他
Don't shoot him

117
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:19,089
医生，回到车里去 - 不！
Doctor, get back in the car - No!

118
01:15:20,023 --> 01:15:21,923
你杀了他。他死了
You killed him. He's dead

119
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:23,391
退后 - 不
Stand back  -No

120
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,527
我还是要轰掉这个混蛋的脑袋
I'm still gonna blow this motherfucker's brains out

121
01:15:25,529 --> 01:15:27,195
走开，离开我的病人
Get away Leave my patient alone

122
01:15:27,197 --> 01:15:29,331
离开那个身体，退后
Get away from the body. Stand back

123
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:32,035
我不会再说了，离嫌疑犯身体远一点
I'm not gonna say it again Step away from the suspect

124
01:15:33,538 --> 01:15:34,537
步骤一
Step a

125
01:15:41,612 --> 01:15:43,348
干!
Fuck

126
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:53,956
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

127
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,191
救命！
Help!

128
01:16:08,707 --> 01:16:11,708
so,就是这个feel
So this is what it feels like

129
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:18,248
救命！
Help!

130
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:03,029
给我的病人腾出地方 - 不！
Make room for my patient - No!

131
01:17:04,431 --> 01:17:07,066
不
No

132
01:17:10,438 --> 01:17:12,538
不！
No!

133
01:17:22,016 --> 01:17:24,450
那些人因为你看到的
These people want to kill this man

134
01:17:24,452 --> 01:17:26,251
那些罪行想杀了这个人
for the crimes you observed

135
01:17:26,253 --> 01:17:28,120
这是最重要的机会
The most important opportunity

136
01:17:28,122 --> 01:17:30,355
来理解邪恶的思想，你瞧
to understand the mind of evil, you see

137
01:17:30,357 --> 01:17:33,093
所以，当他醒来时，我们就准备好了
So, when he awakes, we'll be ready

138
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:35,595
准备好什么？
Ready for what?

139
01:17:35,597 --> 01:17:37,464
重聚
The reunion

140
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:40,332
迈克尔对劳丽・斯特罗德的追求
Michael's pursuit of Laurie Strode

141
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:42,735
可能是他活着的原因
could be what keeps him alive

142
01:17:42,737 --> 01:17:47,373
我怀疑掠食者的概念
I would suspect the notion of being a predator

143
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:52,779
或者害怕成为猎物让他们俩都活着
or the fear of becoming prey keeps both of them alive

144
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:58,151
你想要一份越南三明治吗？
You want a banh mi sandwich?

145
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,771
发现更多的东西失去兴趣了
in discovering anything further

146
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:57,674
这就是我们在这里的原因
Well, that's why we're here

147
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,442
迈克尔是我一生的痴迷
Michael has been my life's obsession

148
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,445
我检查了他的每一份案卷
I've examined every single case file written on him

149
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:05,715
我是卢米斯博士生前的学生
I was a student of Dr. Loomis before he passed away

150
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,917
然后我亲自游说把伊利诺伊大学
And then I lobbied the University of Illinois

151
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,453
分配给迈克尔
to be assigned to Michael myself

152
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,921
有进展吗？
Any progress?

153
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:15,458
50多名临床精神病医生看过他，
Well, he's been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

154
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,862
每个人都有不同的观点
and with each, many different opinions

155
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,931
卢米斯博士是唯一一个在野外见到他的人
Dr. Loomis was the only one to see him in the wild

156
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,868
他断定他是纯粹的邪恶
And he concluded he was nothing more than pure evil

157
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,937
我们的病人在这有新鲜空气、阳光，
Our patients get fresh air, sunshine,

158
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,475
景观、适当的锻炼、健康的饮食
a view, proper exercise, healthy diet

159
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,611
看到他被转移到
It pains me to see him transferred

160
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,481
不太理想的疗养院让我很痛苦
to that less-than-desirable facility

161
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,619
他在那儿
And there he is

162
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,019
他能说话
He can speak

163
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,754
他只是选择不讲
He just chooses not to

164
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,891
如果可能的话，我想站得离他更近点
I'd love to stand closer to him, if I may

165
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,895
了解他的意识，或者他缺乏的意识
Get a sense of his awareness, or lack of awareness

166
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,031
哦，别犯错误啊，他很警觉
Oh, make no mistake, he's aware

167
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,133
当你刚来时，他正看着你
He was watching you as you arrived

168
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:59,037
也许你该把你左脚的鞋带系上
Perhaps you'd like to tie your left shoelace?

169
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,807
托沃利先生，拿着伞的那位
Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman with the umbrella,

170
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,076
对这种事情很固执
has a fixation for such things

171
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,945
不要低估任何人
Underestimate no one

172
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,015
当然当然
Of course

173
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,121
现在走上黄线
And now step up to the yellow line

174
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,655
别再往前了
And no further

175
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,860
在任何情况下都不要越界
Do not cross the line under any circumstances

176
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,097
迈克尔
Michael

177
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,198
迈克尔
Michael

178
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,804
我这有几个人想见见你
I've got some people who'd like to meet you

179
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,075
你好，迈克尔
Hello, Michael

180
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,678
我叫亚伦・科瑞
My name is Aaron Korey

181
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,813
我跟踪你的案子已经好几年了
I've been following your case for years

182
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,184
仍然对你知之甚少
and still know very little about you

183
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,121
我想了解更多
I'd like to know more

184
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,557
关于那晚
About that night

185
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:53,095
关于那些牵扯其中的人
About those involved

186
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,298
迈克尔，你有想过他们吗？
Do you ever think about them, Michael?

187
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,136
对他们的命运感到内疚吗？
Feel guilt about their fate?

188
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:18,785
我从朋友那里借了些东西
I borrowed something from a friend

189
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:21,091
从总检察长办公室，迈克尔
at the attorney general's office, Michael

190
01:17:58,153 --> 01:17:59,385
什么？那是什么？
A what? What is that?

191
01:17:59,387 --> 01:18:00,653
一份越南三明治 - 什么是
A banh mi sandwich - What's a

192
01:18:00,655 --> 01:18:02,555
那是什么？我甚至不知道那是什么
Wh-What is that? I don't even know what that is

193
01:18:02,557 --> 01:18:04,491
弗朗西斯，我就喜欢你这一点，你很容易看透
I love that about you, Francis You're so predictable

194
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:06,760
你就是个每天吃PB&J（花生果酱）三明治的人
You're like a PB and J every day kind of guy

195
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:08,127
哦，我们走了
Oh, here we go

196
01:18:08,129 --> 01:18:09,262
不，一份越南三明治
No, a banh mi sandwich

197
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:10,598
banh mi基本上就是
Banh mi is essentially just

198
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,567
越南语版本的法国面包
the Vietnamese version of a French baguette

199
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,303
这个词实际上是指
Mm-hmm And the term actually refers

200
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:19,473
面包而不是面包中里的东西
to the bread and not so much the contents therein

201
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:21,709
但是你的搭档，
Mm But your partner,

202
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:23,711
世界上最伟大的伙伴
the greatest partner in the world Oh

203
01:18:23,713 --> 01:18:26,280
和越南人在餐馆里商量
made an arrangement with the Vietnamese folks

204
01:18:26,282 --> 01:18:27,515
嗯
at the restaurant Mm

205
01:18:27,517 --> 01:18:29,383
让他们给你做了私家
and had them make you your very own

206
01:18:29,385 --> 01:18:31,621
花生酱果酱越式三明治
peanut butter and jelly banh mi sandwich

207
01:18:33,256 --> 01:18:34,789
听起来很恶心
That sounds disgusting

208
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:36,658
我不会去尝试的，我自己带了食物
I'm not gonna try that I brought my own food

209
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,392
我对我的食物很满意，- 你带来了什么？
I'm very happy with my - What did you bring?

210
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:39,661
你想看看我带来了什么？
You want to see what I brought?

211
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:42,263
是的，我真想看看你带来了什么
Yeah, I do want to see what you brought

212
01:18:42,265 --> 01:18:43,498
你为什么不看看这个？
Why don't you look at this?

213
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,734
看看那个哦
Look at that Oh

214
01:18:45,736 --> 01:18:46,801
新鲜布朗尼 - 好的
Fresh brownie -Okay

215
01:18:46,803 --> 01:18:49,538
巧克力是家里做的布朗尼是我自己做的
Chocolaty homemade brownie I made that myself

216
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,439
那是――那是，像，一个五岁小孩吃的
That's-that's, like, what a five-year-old would eat

217
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:53,375
如果他们能自己做午餐
if they could make their own lunch

218
01:18:53,377 --> 01:18:55,677
我和迈克尔一起多年，
I worked with Michael for years,

219
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,480
但是我从未见过他在不受控制的环境中
but I've never seen him in an uncontrolled environment

220
01:18:58,482 --> 01:19:00,783
我从没听过他说话，你瞧
I've never heard him speak, you see

221
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:04,252
尽管我鼓励他，他仍然反应迟钝
In spite of my encouragements, he remains unresponsive

222
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:08,560
但是今晚，有这么多的可能性
But tonight, so many possibilities exist

223
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:12,795
他跟我说过话
He spoke to me

224
01:19:12,797 --> 01:19:14,430
他跟你说过话？ - 是
He spoke to you?  - Yeah

225
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:17,165
嗯，呃，当他谋杀我的朋友时，
Um, uh, when he murdered my friend,

226
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,802
他看见了我，然后他和我说话
he saw me, and-and he spoke to me

227
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:21,170
他说了什么？
What did he say?

228
01:19:21,172 --> 01:19:22,638
一个词 - 什么？
One word  - What?

229
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,441
放了我，我会告诉你他说了什么
Let me go, and I will tell you what he said

230
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:26,475
你必须告诉我我必须知道，你必须告诉我
You must tell me I must know. You must tell me

231
01:19:26,477 --> 01:19:28,411
放开我，我会告诉你他说了什么
Let me go, and I'll tell you what he said

232
01:19:28,413 --> 01:19:30,546
停车，我会告诉你他说了什么
Just stop the car, and I'll tell you what he said

233
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:39,488
那是什么？
What is that?

234
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:41,558
这很奇怪，对吧？
That's weird, right?

235
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,826
那是霍金斯吗？
Is that Hawkins?

236
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:44,628
我不知道
I don't know

237
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,363
这个词是什么？
What was the word?

238
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,467
是姐姐的名字吗？
Was it the sister's name?

239
01:19:50,903 --> 01:19:52,336
朱迪思？
Judith?

240
01:19:59,278 --> 01:20:01,347
这个词是什么？他妈的
What was the word? Fuck

241
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:04,481
迈克尔
Michael

242
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,827
606 to 601


243
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:16,928
霍金斯
Hawkins

244
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:18,763
回复无线，疲劳的家伙
Answer the fucking radio, burnout

245
01:20:18,765 --> 01:20:21,232
霍金斯？
Hawkins?

246
01:20:22,535 --> 01:20:23,968
606, 601


247
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,971
霍金斯，请回答
Hawkins, please respond

248
01:20:26,973 --> 01:20:28,808
霍金斯
Hawkins

249
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,623
我们去看看好吗
Let's go check it out All right

250
01:20:52,299 --> 01:20:54,368
说点啥吧

251
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:18,858
你能看见他吗？
Can you see him?

252
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,428
霍金斯，请回答
Hawkins, please respond

253
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:24,700
霍金斯，请回答
Hawkins, please respond

254
01:21:25,634 --> 01:21:27,267
我们去看看
Let's go and check it out

255
01:21:27,269 --> 01:21:28,437
好
All right

256
01:21:41,918 --> 01:21:44,719
呼叫总台，这里有个男性挂了
Dispatch, be advised, we got a man down

257
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:45,820
代码10 - 7
He's ten-seven

258
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:47,924
没有601的迹象
No sign of 601

259
01:22:12,816 --> 01:22:14,683
凯伦，灯
Karen, the lights

260
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:16,484
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

261
01:22:16,486 --> 01:22:18,053
我以为你说我们在这里更安全
I thought you said we were safer here

262
01:22:18,055 --> 01:22:20,856
当我谈到那天晚上的时候，你从来不想听
You never wanted to listen when I spoke of that night

263
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:21,857
这就是为什么
And this is why

264
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:25,360
我已经为此做了很长时间的准备
I've been preparing for this for a long time

265
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:26,862
你想让他过来
You want him to come here

266
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:30,799
我很抱歉，凯伦，我很抱歉，宝贝
I'm so sorry, Karen I'm so sorry, baby

267
01:23:17,983 --> 01:23:19,685
有消息吗？
Any word?

268
01:23:25,457 --> 01:23:27,760
嘿，有关于艾莉森的消息吗？
Hey, any word on Allyson?

269
01:23:38,071 --> 01:23:39,837
嘿
Hey

270
01:23:39,839 --> 01:23:41,574
各位
Guys

271
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:49,013
什么...？
Wha...?

272
01:24:18,478 --> 01:24:19,747
雷！
Ray!

273
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,791
凯伦！
Karen!

274
01:24:33,628 --> 01:24:35,596
雷在哪里？
Where's Ray?

275
01:24:36,764 --> 01:24:39,001
迈克尔来了。去地下室
Michael's here. Get downstairs

276
01:24:40,102 --> 01:24:42,070
快去，宝贝，快去！
Go, baby, go!

277
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,023
妈妈！
Mom!

278
01:25:43,133 --> 01:25:44,101
妈妈！
Mom!

279
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:44,028
我这样抚养你是错误的，
I was wrong to raise you the way I did,

280
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:46,163
但至少我能保护你
but at least I can protect you

281
01:26:46,165 --> 01:26:48,899
你不会有事的
Nothing will happen to you

282
01:26:48,901 --> 01:26:51,235
我知道你以为这是我的笼子
I know you thought this was my cage

283
01:26:55,641 --> 01:26:57,775
我很害怕
I'm scared

284
01:27:38,952 --> 01:27:41,088
我必须完成这个
I have to finish this

285
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:46,724
妈妈
Mom

286
01:27:46,726 --> 01:27:47,926
我爱你
I love you

287
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:49,761
我爱你，宝贝
I love you, baby

288
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,714
你感觉到了吧，是吧，迈克尔？
You feel it, don't you, Michael?

289
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,321
你感觉到面具了吗
You feel the mask

290
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:55,723
费加罗。费加罗！
Figaro. Figaro!

291
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,065
说话，迈克尔
Say something, Michael

292
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,335
说话啊
Say something

293
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,349
你能感觉到，不是吗？
You can feel it, can't you?

294
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:22,385
这是你身体的一部分啊，迈克尔
It's a part of you, Michael

295
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:25,955
这是你的一部分

00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:47,677
说话啊！
Say something!

299
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:31,151
我们要找什么？
What is it we're after?

300
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:33,220
好吧，
Okay, well,

301
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,057
目睹了那畜生被关起来的样子
having witnessed the animal in its captive state

302
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,326
但没有引起他任何反应，
and failed to provoke any sort of response,

303
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:43,063
我们现在追踪它的对应部分
we now track down its counterpart

304
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:47,335
会不会是一个怪物创造了另一个怪物？
Could it be that one monster has created another?

305
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,070
尽管将他们分开的铁锁和铁丝网
And although the iron bars and barbed wire

306
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,308
既坚固又锋利，
that separate them are both strong and sharp,

307
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,510
形而上学的界限模糊且细微
the metaphysical lines are blurred and slight

308
00:08:55,512 --> 00:09:00,181
两者都孤立存在，被自己的恐惧所束缚
Both exist in isolation, fettered by their own fear

309
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,016
还有彼此的仇恨 
-是这了

310
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,051
这里？
Here?

311
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:05,420
难道让这个恐怖的家伙
Could it be that the only hope

312
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:08,122
恢复的唯一希望
of rehabilitation Spooky

313
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:09,824
是通过对抗么？
is through confrontation?

314
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,326
谢绝来访
Access has been denied

315
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:13,495
私人财产。不准擅自闯入。

316

你可能需要这个

317
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:25,140
Dana，记者采访不用富兰克林爷爷的
Dana, journalists don't pay for their interviews

318
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:26,408
笑一个
Smile

319
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,412
我们在监控里
We're on camera

320
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,820

324
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,239
我们是调查记者
We're investigative journalists

325
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,411
如果你有时间，我们已经走了很长的路
If you have a moment, we've traveled a very long way

326
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:04,149
3000富兰克林爷爷怎么样？
How does $3,000 sound?

327
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,936
你好
Hello

328
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:00,938
我们可以进来吗？
May we come in?

329
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,210
坐下来谈谈？
And-and sit down and talk?

330
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:15,954
因此
So

331
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:18,423
亚伦和我做了几个

获奖的公共广播节目

334
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,930
的一起谋杀案有了新的发现
on a murder case from 20 years ago

335
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:30,236
我们喜欢用不偏不倚的眼光重新审视事件
We like to reexamine incidents with an unbiased lens

336
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,071
我相信从您经历
I believe there's a lot to learn

337
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:33,541
的恐怖中有很多东西值得了解
from the horrors you experienced

338
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,642
没什么可了解的
There's nothing to learn

339
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:39,645
根本没有新的见解
There are no new insights

340
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,283
或者新发现
or discoveries

341
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:44,984
那么，他是真的吗？
So, is he real?

342
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,586
谁？
Who?

343
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,689
夜魔
The Boogeyman

344
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,256
我看到你引用的
I read you quoted

345
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,492
你不相信妖怪？
You don't believe in the Boogeyman?

346
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:58,164
我相信迈克尔・迈尔斯，是疯狂的连环杀手，但是
I believe in Michael Myers, deranged serial killer, but

347
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,403
夜魔，不，我不信
the Boogeyman, no

348
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,573
哦，你应该信
Well, you should

349
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,608
好吧
Okay

350
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,643
迈克尔・迈尔斯是只是一个人
Michael Myers is a human being

351
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,746
他六岁时杀了他妹妹

352
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,450
然后他来追杀你
Then he came after you

353
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,551
我们只是想知道为什么
We just want to know why

354
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,453
我们想要一瞥他的内心
We want a glimpse inside his mind

355
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:23,023
这就是为什么你的故事如此重要
That's why your story is so important

356
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,027
我的故事？

两次失败的婚姻

迈克尔・迈尔斯杀了五个人

360
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,308
他是一个我们需要了解的人？
And he's a human being we need to understand?

361
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,577
我两次离婚
I'm twice divorced

362
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,548
我是个废人
And I'm a basket case

363
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,084
他们要转移他
They're transferring him

364
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,487
明天7 : 00
Tomorrow, 7:00

365
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,690
他会――他会一直被关着直到他死
He'll-he'll be locked away until the end of his days

366
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,427
对，就该这么干
That's the idea

367
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:01,029
让我们谈谈有关部门过来
Let's talk about when the state came

368
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,598
带走了你的女儿
to take your daughter away

369
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,333
她才12岁
She was 12 years old

370
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,635
他们说你是个不称职的母亲
They said you were an unfit mother

371
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:09,474
你多久后才重新获得监护权？
How long until you regained custody?

372
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,710
我没有监护权
I didn't

373
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,648
但是你已经知道了
But you already knew that

374
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:21,283
劳丽，我们看见他了

我们见过迈克尔
We met with Michael

376
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,121
我给他看了面具
I showed him the mask

377
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:28,090
但什么都没发生
There was nothing

378
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,827
没有回应。什么都没发生
No response. Nothing

379
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:32,796
他不会和任何人说话
He won't talk to anyone

380
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:35,298
从来没有，但是
Never has, but

381
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,368
我想他可能会和你说话
I think he might speak with you

382
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,104
那么，你为什么不和他坐下来
So, why don't you sit down with him

383
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:46,643
说出所有你想说的话
and say all the things you must be longing to say

384
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:49,112
跟我们走，
Come with us,

385
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:52,284
让我们帮你解脱

出去
Get out

390
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:16,274
你想在我的水槽下面拉屎？

391
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,844
我会杀了你和你全家

我把棉花糖换成了花生酱
I switched from marshmallow fluff to peanut butter

393
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,417
看看那些小杂种吃不吃
See if those little bastards eat that

394
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,185
那应该会杀了他们

395
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,822
我重新安排了我最后一个会议的时间，这样我今晚就可以了
I rescheduled my last session, so I can make it tonight

396
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,391
妈妈，你真的没必要这么做
You really didn't have to do that, Mom

397
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,792
没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal

398
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,427
你进入了国家荣誉协会
You made it into the National Honor Society

399
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,762
是的，这是件大事
Yeah That is a very big deal

400
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,797

I just made it to the top of my shop class,

401
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,834

402
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,704
我们很高兴见到卡梅伦
We're excited to meet Cameron

403
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,840
然而，他们全家都有名声

404
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,608

415
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:06,926
你今晚见到他时就知道了

416
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:10,496
对，他们都是好人，直到他们把你肚子搞大
They're all nice guys until they get you pregnant,

417
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,799
然后你就得开他们的皮卡，
and then you gotta drive in their pickup trucks,

418
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,767
跟他们打炮，有一堆孩子
and you clean their guns, and you got children,

419
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:17,470
接着打炮，然后跟他们嗑嗨了

420
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:18,738
然后你就肥了

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,556
你说你邀请老奶，你请了么
Did you invite Grandmother like you said you would?

425
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:38,258
今晚的事，你说你会
About tonight You said that you'd

426
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,827
哦
Oh

427
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:42,229
对。我请了
Right. I did

428
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,864
-是吗？
-You did? 

429
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,532
我昨天和她谈过了
I talked to her yesterday

430
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,735
她不能来了，亲爱的。对不起
She's not gonna be able to come, honey. I'm sorry

431
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:48,937
真的吗？
Really?

432
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,771
是
Yeah

433
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:53,273
宝贝，她有陌生环境恐惧症
Baby, she's agoraphobic

434
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,710
她需要认知行为治疗
She needs cognitive behavioral therapy,

435
00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,912
所以不要把这个当成针对你个人的
so don't take it personally

436
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,850
那是维基。我得走了
That's Vicky. I gotta go

437
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:03,652
嘿，我爱你
Hey, I love you

438
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:06,388
祝你愉快
Have a good day

439
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,789
再见，老爹，爱你哦
Bye, Dad. Love you Okay

440
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,457
所以，我妈是个骗子
So, my mom's a liar

441
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,359
怎么了？
What happened?

442
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,727
她说她今晚邀请了
She said that she invited

443
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:14,629
我祖母，但她没有
my grandmother tonight, but she didn't

444
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:16,431
我的意思是，她甚至没有联系过她
I mean, she never even contacted her

445
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,968
你怎么知道的？因为我自己打电话给她了
How do you know? Because I called her myself

446
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,735
-这也太扯了 -是啊
-That's bullshit -Yeah

447
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:23,806
老兄，你妈怎么了？她为什么要那么说？
Dude, what's your mom's deal? Why would she say that?

448
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:27,275
我不知道。她就是想让我离她远点
I don't know. She just tries to keep me away from her

449
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,576
我家里的每个人，就好像
Everyone in my family, like,

450
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:31,747
一年中的这个时候都变成了个疯子
turns into a total nutcase this time of year

451
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,816
如果我是你们，我也不会庆祝
If I were you guys, I wouldn't celebrate, either

452
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,519
我就放一棵圣诞树就行了
I would just put up a Christmas tree instead

453
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:39,422
跳过所有令人毛骨悚然的狗屎万圣节，对吧？
Just skip all over the creepy Halloween shit, right?

454
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:41,791
你老奶说过这些么？
Does your grandma ever talk about it?

455
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,959
是的，这几乎是她说的的全部
Yeah, it's pretty much all she talks about

456
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,328
它定义了她的生活
It defines her life

457
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,297
从那以后，她精神上受打击很大
She's been traumatized ever since

458
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,399
是不是她哥哥，
Wasn't it her brother who, like,

459
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,002
冷血谋杀了所有这些青少年？
cold-blooded murdilated all those teenagers?

460
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:53,436
不
No

461
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,404
我觉得这只是一些人瞎编的
That's just a bit that some people made up

462
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:56,840
为了让他们自己觉得好受
to make them feel better, I think

463
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:59,508
我的意思是，自己的一群朋友被
I mean, that is scary to have a bunch of your friends

464
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,844
随便一个疯子杀掉这件事太可怕了
get butchered by some random crazy person

465
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:03,013
是吗？但是，从大方面考虑，
Is it, though? Because, all things considered,

466
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:05,615
今天发生了很多更糟糕的事情
there's a lot worse stuff that's happening today

467
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:08,051
我是说，有几个人被人拿到砍死了
And, like, I mean, what, a couple people getting killed

468
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,954
并不是什么大不了的事
by one guy with a knife is not that big of a deal

469
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:13,423
伙计，她的老奶差点被杀了唉
Dude, her grandmother was almost fucking murdered

470
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:16,393
她逃掉了，他们抓住了他，
And she escaped, and they caught him,

471
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,994
现在他被监禁了
and now he's incarcerated

472
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,364
我就是说说的，比如，按照今天的标准
I-I'm just saying, like, by today's standards

473
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,967
你TMD闭嘴吧，戴夫
Just shut the fuck up, Dave

474
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,501
闭肛
Shut up

475
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,970
哦，对不起，呵~闭嘴，戴夫
Oh, I'm sorry Yeah, shut up, Dave

476
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:27,471
嘿，如果我把
Hey, is it cool with you guys

477
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:29,040
其中一个南瓜头给炸了，你们没意见吧？
if I explode one of these pumpkin heads?

478
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,042
没意见。是啊，去吧
Yeah. Yeah Go for it

479
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,744
哦，他是认真的么？
Oh, he's serious?

480
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,679
他是认真的，哦，天哪，他真要把那给炸了
He's serious Oh, God, he's really blowing it up

481
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,681
我知道他就是个T妈的傻
I know He's such a fucking moron

482
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:37,849
哦，上帝。哦，上帝 - 哦，天啊
Oh, God. Oh, God  - Oh,Jesus

483
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,917
闪，快闪，闪了
Go, go, go, go, go

484
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,853
万圣节快乐！
Happy Halloween!

485
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:43,921
啊！
Ah!

486
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,356
卡梅伦
Cameron

487
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:46,991
吓到你了吧，不错哦
I got you That was a good one

488
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:48,359
是的，很不错
Yes, that was very good

489
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,594
嘿，明晚的东西都准备齐了么
Hey, do you have everything

490
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,096
明晚晚上的礼服之类的
for your costume tomorrow night?

491
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,765
邦妮和克莱德必须合二为一，毕竟嗯
Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one, after all Um

492
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,969
不，我是说，今晚我更专注
no, I mean, I-I'm more focused on tonight

493
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,536
今晚？
Tonight?

494
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,371
你说你父母很守旧的时候
I-I thought you were joking when you said

495
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,708
我还以为你在开玩笑
your parents were old-fashioned

496
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,042
乖一点，好吗？- 行
Be nice, okay? - Okay

497
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,644
会很好玩的
It'll be fun

498
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,579
今晚我很兴奋 - 我需要冷静下来
I'm excited for tonight - I need to calm down

499
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,783
今晚我很兴奋，行吗？- 行
I'm excited for tonight, okay?  -Okay

500
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,684
哦，啊，哦
Ooh

501
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:15,554
呃。你们俩简直太恶心了，知道么
Ugh. You guys are just barf, you know

502
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:17,356
你俩只是两个恶心的矮胖子，
You're just you're two yucky dumpsters,

503
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,658
我也想来一下。过来。么啊！- 别
and I want to go diving. Come here. Mwah! - No

504
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,626
兄弟，兄弟 - 就这，就这，行吧？
Dude, dude - Right here, right here, right?

505
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,361
么么么啊 - 伙计，你你
Oh. Mwah, mwah - Dude, you-you got

506
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:24,030
你的烂嘴弄了我
your little chapped-lip crusties

507
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:25,497
一身口水，伙计，所以真谢谢你
all over me, man, so thanks

508
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,966
我知道，不用谢我
I know. And you're welcome

509
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,102
太恶心了- 这唇是我身体专门给
It's gross  - It's a little part of me for you

510
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,536
你余生准备的
For the rest of your day

511
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:31,871
怎么样？那么
All right? So, do you have

512
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:33,541
明天你的服装准备好了吗？
everything ready for your costume tomorrow?

513
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,612
嗯...关于那个 - 怎么了？
Um... about that - What?

514
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,379
你们是认真的么？
Are we seriously not?

515
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:42,715
你说过我们要一起跳万圣节舞的
You said we were gonna do this whole Halloween dance together

516
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,784
现在你们把我踢了
Now-now you just you ditch me

517
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,119
我的意思是，你只是你――你不带这么
I mean, you just you-you can't walk

518
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,821
欺负人的 - 好吧，好吧
all over town breaking hearts - Okay, okay, okay

519
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:48,955
嘿，听着，听着  - 怎么样？
Hey, listen, listen - All right?

520
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:50,824
真爱啊 - 好吧，情侣们，一会再闹好么
Love. Truly - Okay lovebirds, later

521
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,428
现在让我们把书翻到
Now let's open our books to

522
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,565
弗兰克尔的解释
Frankl's interpretation

523
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:03,436
他说，命运选择了不同的道路
He said, Fate took a different course

524
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:07,675
我理解这个世界上一个一无所有的人
I understand how someone who has nothing left in this world

525
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:10,511
可能仍然知道幸福。
may still know bliss.

526
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:12,980
他传达的信息给人以希望
His message is totally hopeful

527
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:16,684
即使在最恶劣的条件下，
Even in the most disparaging of conditions,

528
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,519
生活也可以找到它的意义
life can find its meaning,

529
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,156
相反，一个人的痛苦也是如此
and conversely, so can one's suffering

530
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:23,124
i
I

531
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,060
这钱我不能要
can't accept this

532
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:27,864
用它来满足你内心的愿望
Use it for whatever your heart desires

533
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,132
那我就把它存起来上大学
I'll save it for college, then

534
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,633
去他妈的大学
Fuck college

535
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:35,704
去什么地方，去墨西哥
Go somewhere. Go to Mexico

536
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,172
你能想象吗？
Could you imagine?

537
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:39,576
是的，我可以
Yeah, I can

538
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,616
听着，别担心你妈妈
Look, don't worry about your mom

539
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,184
她会发疯的
She will freak

540
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,519
但是她会克服的
But she'll get over it

541
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,490
你为什么不能克服？
Why can't you?

542
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,561
夜魔？
The Boogeyman?

543
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:02,164
所有这些躲躲藏藏，所有这些准备，
All this hiding, all this preparation,

544
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,833
其实没有意义
it was for nothing

545
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,068
我的意思是，这些弄得比你的家庭更重要
I mean, it took priority over your family

546
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,037
这让你失去了家人
It cost you your family

547
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,011
如果我抚养你母亲的方式意味着她恨我
If the way I raised your mother means that she hates me

548
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,913
但是她已经对这个
but that she's prepared

549
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,483
恐怖的世界做好了准备，那么
for the horrors of this world, then

550
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,053
我可以忍受
I can live with that

551
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:29,661
跟迈克尔说再见，然后忘掉这些
Say good-bye to Michael, and get over it

552
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:32,996
我走了，拜
Good-bye

553
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,264
塞缪尔・卢米斯博士，
Dr. Samuel Loomis,

554
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,801
1979年1月22日
January 22, 1979

555
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,003
你想就以下问题发表声明吗
Do you wish to give a statement regarding

556
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,072
关于你的前病人迈克尔・迈尔斯？
your former patient, Michael Myers?

557
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,075
我的建议是终结
My suggestion is termination

558
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,544
死亡是迈克尔唯一的解决办法
Death is the only solution for Michael

559
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,313
A2201。迈克尔・迈尔斯
A2201. Myers, Michael

560
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,248
脚趾排成一行。保持一条线。让魔鬼活着
Toes in line. Keep a line .There's nothing

561
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,817
你是讨不到好的。 - 手举起来
to be gained from keeping evil alive  - Hands up!

562
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,986
举起手来！站起来！
Hands up! Stand up!

563
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:28,786
A22
A22

564
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,690
一针硫喷妥钠
A shot of sodium thiopental

565
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,726
会使他失去知觉
would render him unconscious

566
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,162
A22我会和他在一起以确保
A22 I'll be with him to make sure

567
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,765
他的生命消失
his life is extinguished

568
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:43,602
我的耳朵贴在他的胸口，亲子听
My ear on his chest to hear for myself

569
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,637
他的身体器官不再起作用
that his vitals no longer function

570
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,975
并立即焚烧尸体
and immediately incinerate the body

571
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,145
它必须得死
It needs to die

572
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,615
它必须死！
It needs to die!

573
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:12,065
它必须死！
It needs to die!

574
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,834
继续前进。我们走吧
Keep moving. Let's go

575
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,736
别担心，迈克尔
Don't worry, Michael

576
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:19,509
我会在你身边
I'll be by your side

577
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:31,052
迈克尔・迈尔斯仍然是我的病人
Michael Myers is still my patient

578
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:33,120
直到他被别人照顾
until he's in somebody else's care,

579
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:36,891
所以我一直坚持到最后
so I'm seeing my duty through till the end

580
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:39,062
好了，出发
All right, move out

581
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,287
把我的DNA寄给一个陌生人
send my DNA away to a stranger

582
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,289
为什么不呢？你可以发现一些非常有趣的事情
Why not? You can find out some pretty interesting things

583
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,957
我不就发现我是切诺基混血么
Don't I found out that I'm part Cherokee

584
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,159
我猜我爸爸大概有百分之七的切诺基血统
I guess my dad's, like, seven percent Cherokee

585
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:13,061
我认识朗尼，我和他一起上过高中
I know Lonnie I went to high school with him

586
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:14,429
他曾经卖给我迷幻药 - 老爹
He used to sell me peyote  - Dad

587
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:17,065
每个人都认识朗尼 -是的。-爸爸
Everyone knows Lonnie - Yeah. - Dad

588
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:18,266
对不起，好吧。嗯
I'm sorry All right. Um

589
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:20,102
这是一个信息量过大的分享
this is a massive overshare

590
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:21,369
对我们的新朋友来说 - 不，他确实做过
for our new friend - No, he did

591
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,406
我和他爸爸一起自我探索了很多东西
I learned a lot about myself with his dad

592
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:25,341
我和他爸爸在树林里玩的很嗨 - 老爹
Tripped balls out in the woods, me and his dad  -Dad

593
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,042
孩子，雷・很嗨。-爸爸！
Boy, Ray Tripping balls. - Dad!

594
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,811
不，真的，继续说
No, really, keep talking

595
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,314
所以，你们有明天的大计划
So, you guys have big plans for tomorrow

596
00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:33,149
在高中？你们打算怎么搞？

597
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:34,749
是跳舞还是什么？是的，这是万圣节
Is it a dance or something? Yeah, it's a Halloween

601
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:40,990
呃，嗯，我不知道是否允许我说
Uh, well, I don't know if I'm allowed to say

602
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:41,991
请说吧，哦，来吧
Please say Oh, come on

604
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:45,728
嗯，那个我们就打扮成邦妮和克莱德
Uh, so we're going as Bonnie and Clyde

605
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,929
哦，这是个好主意
Oh, that's a great idea Yeah

606

除了 - 哦

哦。不
Oh. No Ooh

608
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,199
好吧，那么只有邦妮和克莱德
Okay, so just Bonnie and Clyde

609
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:51,267
就这样。邦妮和克莱德
That's it. Bonnie and Clyde

610
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:52,436
邦妮和克莱德搞一起
Bonnie and Clyde with a twist

611
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:53,870
经典耶！

是啊！-我喜欢这个不错
Yeah! - I love that Nice

这太有趣了，你会看到的

614
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,374
你知道它是怎么结束的，对吧？

615
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,075
他们的故事结束得有点不错。有希望地

是的，你有一辆老爷车
Yeah You have a jalopy

618
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,114
到处都是联邦探员的子弹孔？
filled with bullet holes from the G-men?

619
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:05,315
我希望我们有一个
I wish we had one of those

620
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:07,351
它在劳克林，就像我知道的A型车一样
It was in Laughlin, like a Model A I know

621
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,753
你和祖母谈过了吗？

她说她要来么？

她来到我的办公室，我们谈得很愉快

我们何不从头开始，好吗？

That's enough, Laurie-  Okay

I think maybe this is a little bit too much for you, huh?

666
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,145
我们出去走走吧，好吗？
Why don't we go for a walk, all right?

667

你说过你会尝试
You said you were gonna try

668
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:41,081
把过去抛在身后，劳丽
to put the past behind you Laurie

669
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,216
好吗？你会尝试这样做吗？
Okay? Are you gonna try to do that?

670
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,918
这就是你说你想做的
That's what you said you wanted to do

671

我不能

我很高兴你能看到这一点
I'm glad you got to see that

677
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:40,275
我从没告诉过你我是如何度过童年的
I never told you how I spent my childhood

678
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,179
找到你了
Gotcha

我学会了如何战斗

我做了关于地下室的噩梦
I had nightmares about the basement

682
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,928
社会保障机构在我12岁的时候把我带走
Social Services came when I was

683
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:08,036
我花了一辈子的时间试图摆脱疑神疑鬼
I've spent my entire life trying to get over the paranoia

684
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:10,406
以及她投射在我身上的神经过敏
and neuroses that she has projected on me

685
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:12,007
是的，他有点提醒我

是啊，四分卫的事情都搞砸了
Yeah, that quarterback thing is all messed up

688
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:17,349
还不错，对吧？
Good times, right?

689
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:22,118
她自己会怎么处理？
What is she gonna do with herself?

690
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,522
我知道的，救她不是你的工作
I know It's not your job to save her

691
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:30,694
她会没事的
She'll be all right

692
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:33,229
收不到台啊
I can't get reception

693
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:34,931
自从天线在洗车场被

弄弯之后就收不到

695
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:38,101
为什么我们要再次出来？
Why do we have to come out again?

696
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,370
我们总是这样做
We do this all the time

697
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:41,003
什么？你不喜欢吗？
What? You don't you don't enjoy it?

698

我喜欢在森林里

00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:45,509
不，我喜欢，但是我错过了舞蹈课
No, I enjoy it, but I'm missing dance class for this

700
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,578
有时我宁愿这样做也不愿打猎
And sometimes I would rather do that than hunting

701
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,513
我的意思是，舞蹈课对你来说重要吗？
I mean, is-is-is dance class that important to you?

702
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,348
是的，确实重要 - 你需要更多的时间
Yeah, it is  -You need some more time

703
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,150
在森林里打猎和钓鱼 -不
in the woods to go hunting and fishing  - No

704
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,485
周末，我可以和你一起，爸爸
On weekends, I'll do it with you, Dad

705
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:56,253
比如，我真的很喜欢和你在一起，
Like, I really love spending time with you,

706
00:27:56,255 --> 00:27:58,255
但是现在跳舞是我的事，你懂的，而且
but right now dancing is my thing, you know, and

707
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,090
我真的很用心，我的意思是，我
it really hits me in the heart I mean, I

708
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,526
爸爸，小心！哦！
Dad, look out! Oh!

709
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:08,500
霍斯，你到底怎么了？
What the hell happened to you, Hoss?

710
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:10,602
哦，妈的
Oh, shit

711
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,604
爸爸，看

小陆，你留在这里

713
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:17,709
我过去看看有没有人受伤
I'm gonna make sure no one's hurt

714
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,544
你打电话报警，可以么？
You call the police Okay

715
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:21,679
爸爸，请小心
Dad, be careful, please

716
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:23,281
嘿，你们没事吧？
Hey, you fellas okay?

717
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,155
你没事吧？

是的。嗯，发生了一起事故

人们在路上跑来跑去
People running around in the road

722
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,609
我爸爸过去看了，我――我不知道

723
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:53,145
好吧。继续
Okay. Hold on

724
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,713
我去看看
I'll go check

725
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,203
爸爸？
Dad?

726
00:29:57,113 --> 00:29:59,113

734
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,482
哦，操！操！
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

735
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:05,250
乘坐这趟火车不需要信用卡。
Don't need a credit card to ride this train.

736
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:08,719
哟，霍克，听着，球松了，那是哪里
Yo, Hawk, listen, the ball come down loose, that's where

你给我来杯咖啡就行了，可以么？

但是你永远也打不赢我的分数，
But you ain't never gonna beat my score,

743
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:20,464
所以你做什么都没关系

再说一遍，你永远不会

00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,200
我想我听到了什么声音之类的
I thought I heard, like, a noise or something

1109
00:55:04,202 --> 00:55:07,403
是啊，可能只是朱利安在屙屎
Yeah, it's probably just Julian taking a dump

1110
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:09,272
你去看看好吗？
Would you go look?

1111
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:11,240
一定要去么
Do I have to?

1112
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:12,708
是的，你能去看看吗？
Yeah, would you please go look?

1113
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,044
行
Okay

1114
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:17,713
很奇怪好吧
It was weird All right

1115
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:20,186
好吧，小伙伴
All right, little buddy

1116
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,223
哦，干！ - 我看见有人在走廊上，
Oh, fuck me！ - I saw someone in the hallway,

1117
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:27,657
就站在我家门外
standing outside my door

1118
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:28,825
哦，怎么了，伙计？
Oh What's up, buddy?

1119
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:31,727
有一张死脸，从黑暗中看着我
There was a fucked-up face, watching me from the dark

1120
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,130
鬼和妖怪，小伙伴？
Ghosts and goblins, little buddy?

1121
00:55:33,132 --> 00:55:34,832
闭嘴，戴夫！我听到他的呼吸声，
Shut up, Dave! I heard him breathing,

1122
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:36,934
然后我看见了他他在这里
and then I saw him He's in here

1123
00:55:36,936 --> 00:55:38,102
夜魔在这房子里
Boogeyman's in this house

1124
00:55:38,104 --> 00:55:40,337
好吧。好吧，来吧，我懂了
Okay. All right Come on, I got you

1125
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:43,674
我们区看看，- 让戴夫先去
Let's check it out  - Send Dave first

1126
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:45,343

No, it's fine. It's fine No, no. No, it's not

It's okay. Come on  - No, it's not. No, it's not

1128
00:55:47,113 --> 00:55:48,246
来吧，告诉我你在哪里看到了夜魔
Come on, show me where you saw Boogeyman

1129
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:49,481
我会保护你的。我很强壮。我保护你 - 不
I'll protect you. I'm strong. I got you - No

1130
00:55:49,483 --> 00:55:51,715
不，维姬，你先上去，- 我会把他打出去
No, Vicky, you go up there first - I'll fight him off

1131
00:55:51,717 --> 00:55:52,716
来吧。我保证 - 不
Come on. I promise  - No

1132
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:55,220
你能给我妈妈打电话吗？好的
Can you call my mom? Yeah

1133
00:55:55,222 --> 00:55:56,988
如果房间里有什么东西，我会打电话给她
If there's something in the room, I'll call her

1134
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,224
他就站在那里――在门里
He was standing right there in-in the door

1135
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:01,328
我去看看
I'll check it out

1136
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,836
对不起，先生
Excuse me, sir

1137
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,005
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing in here?

1138
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:16,741
拜托，请离开这
Please, you need to leave

1139
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:18,245
请离开
Please leave

1140
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,012
维基？

1141
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:22,983
现在就出去！
Get out now!

1142
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,852
吓到你了吧 - 你他妈的在开玩笑吗？
Gotcha - You fucking kidding me?

1143
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:29,455
你很安全
You're safe

1144
00:56:29,457 --> 00:56:30,890
这里什么都没有
Nothing's in here

1145
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:33,758
你确定？嗯
You sure? Mm-hmm

1146
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,895
你检查窗帘后面了么？
Y-You check behind the curtains?

1147
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:37,930
我检查了整个房间
I checked the whole place

1148
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:19,272
干啊
Sick

1149
00:57:19,274 --> 00:57:21,208
看到了吗？没什么好害怕的
See? There's nothing to be afraid of

1150
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,477
这里没有什么夜魔
There's no Boogeyman in here

1151
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:25,213
如果是洋娃娃怎么办？
What if it's a doll?

1152
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:28,482
哦，可能是，比如，一个奇怪的，小娃娃，
Ooh, it could be, like, one of those weird, like, kid dolls,

1153
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:30,951
一个奇怪的婴儿，他们盯着你
one of those weird babies, and they stare at you

1154
00:57:30,953 --> 00:57:33,321
用那双闪亮的小眼睛
with those beady little eyes

1155
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,546
救命！戴夫！

朱利安，快跑！
Julian, run!

1160
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:41,991
我去找人帮忙。戴夫！戴夫！维基？
I'll go get help. Dave! Dave! Vicky?

1161
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:44,294
快跑！

1162
00:58:44,296 --> 00:58:47,997
不要上去！戴夫，你会被杀的
Don't go up there! You're gonna get killed, Dave

1163
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:48,998
谁来帮我！
Somebody help me!

1164
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,099
戴夫，帮我！维姬
Dave, help me! Vicky

1165
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:51,602
不，不，不，不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no, no, no

1166
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,337
不，不，不
No, no, no

1167
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:57,441
不！不！
No! No!

1168
00:58:57,443 --> 00:58:58,941
去他妈的
Fuck this

1169
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,383
各单位，我们有报告
All units, we have reports

1170
00:59:06,385 --> 00:59:08,218
子午线大道707号的家庭骚乱

Okay, guys, don't forget to say thank you

1174
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:34,179
来吧，够了。不，来吧
Come on That's enough. No, come on

1175
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:37,017
不，他们可以多吃一点，亲爱的
No, they can have a little more, honey

1176
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:54,232
不给糖就捣蛋，闻闻脚汗不汗
Trick or treat, smell my feet,

1177
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:57,170
给我一些好吃的
give me something good to eat

1178
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:17,523
哈登菲尔德公安局的！
Haddonfield Sheriff's Department!

1179
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:20,596
针对家庭骚乱！
Responding to a domestic disturbance!

1180
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,739
我重复一遍，这是霍金斯警官
I repeat This is Officer Hawkins

1181
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:34,576
请回复
Please respond

1182
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:54,562
亲爱的，小心！
Honey, watch out!

1183
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:57,230
从这里给我消失！现在！
Get out of here! Now!

1184
01:00:57,232 --> 01:00:58,666
走吧，伙计们。快走
Let's go, guys. Move

1185
01:05:30,882 --> 01:05:32,615
看起来像个傻
and looks like an idiot

1186
01:05:32,617 --> 01:05:37,386
然后我看起来也像个傻比给他辩解
And then I look like an idiot for vouching for him

1187
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:00,169
进去！
Get inside!

1188
01:01:54,693 --> 01:01:55,758
操！
Fuck!

1189
01:02:15,614 --> 01:02:17,482
迈克尔！
Michael!

1190
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:32,230
哦，妈的
Oh, shit

1191
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:56,153
劳丽。操！
Laurie. Fuck!

1192
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:58,155
天啊，弗兰克！
Jesus Christ, Frank!

1193
01:02:58,157 --> 01:02:59,691
靠！他妈的怎么了？
Fuck me! What the fuck?

1194
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:03,428
你来这干嘛?
What the hell are you doing here?

1195
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,730
弗兰克，他在这里
Frank, he's here

1196
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:07,332
我知道
I know

1197
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,913
请这边走
This way, please

1198
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:32,694
看看谁来了
Look who's up

1199
01:03:34,328 --> 01:03:36,464
他在哪里？
Where is he?

1200
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:39,500
你告诉我
You tell me

1201
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:46,339
迈克尔放倒了警卫和司机之后
The bus lost control after Michael

1202
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:48,341
巴士失去控制了
overtook the first guard and the driver

1203
01:03:48,343 --> 01:03:49,943
他不再休眠了
He's no longer dormant

1204
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:51,878
他只知道如何继续前进
He only knows how to keep moving

1205
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,479
继续杀戮
and to keep killing

1206
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:55,751
除非他被捕，否则他会再次杀人
And he will kill again unless he's captured

1207
01:03:57,285 --> 01:03:59,620
跟我来一会儿
Come with me for a minute

1208
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:01,187
你坐着别动
You sit still

1209
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:02,723
嗯，我是坐着不动的啊
Well, I was sitting still anyway

1210
01:04:02,725 --> 01:04:04,658
什么意思? - 留着他有用
What do you mean? - He's an asset

1211
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,593
他没用，他是个累赘
He's not an asset He's a liability

1212
01:04:06,595 --> 01:04:08,395
不，不，他也得参与行动
No, no. He's on this hunt

1213
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:10,731
没有人比他更了解迈尔斯
Nobody knows Myers better than he does

1214
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:13,367
哦，谢谢你， - 你要我带着
Oh, thank you - You want me to take

1215
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:14,901
这个受伤的平民要去寻找
this injured civilian to go look for

1216
01:04:14,903 --> 01:04:17,371
精神病连环杀手？警长
a psychopathic serial killer? Sheriff

1217
01:04:17,373 --> 01:04:18,772
弗兰克。我们在做什么？
Frank. Wha-What are we doing? 

1218
01:04:18,774 --> 01:04:19,840
劳丽，我们现在不需要你的帮助
We don't need your help right now, Laurie

1219
01:04:19,842 --> 01:04:23,210
你就这么傻站着！快做点什么！
You're just standing here! Please do something!

1220
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:24,413
对不起，警官们
Excuse me, officers

1221
01:04:25,347 --> 01:04:27,583
劳丽・斯特罗德
Laurie Strode

1222
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:34,756
劳丽・斯特罗德，见见萨丹医生
Laurie Strode, meet Dr. Sartain

1223
01:04:34,758 --> 01:04:36,791
我是迈克尔的医生
I'm Michael's doctor

1224
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:38,393
兰比尔・萨尔坦
Ranbir Sartain

1225
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:41,564
哦，你是新的卢米斯
Oh, you're the new Loomis

1226
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:45,702
我读过你和迈克尔的一切
I read everything about you and Michael

1227
01:04:48,004 --> 01:04:49,873
一切
Everything

1228
01:04:51,274 --> 01:04:53,474
你认识我们的朋友霍金斯吗
Did you know our friend Hawkins here

1229
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:55,610
是第一个应诉代理人
was the first responding deputy

1230
01:04:55,612 --> 01:04:58,881
迈克尔在1978年被捕的时候？
when Michael was apprehended in 1978?

1231
01:04:58,883 --> 01:05:01,750
那天晚上，他阻止了卢米斯杀死迈克尔
He stopped Loomis from killing Michael that night

1232
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:06,387
你知道我每天晚上祈祷
Do you know that I pray every night

1233
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:08,356
他会逃跑吗？
that he would escape?

1234
01:05:08,358 --> 01:05:10,893
你干嘛这么做？
What the hell do you do that for?

1235
01:05:10,895 --> 01:05:13,395
这样我就可以杀了他
So I can kill him

1236
01:05:13,397 --> 01:05:16,434
好吧，这是为愚蠢的事情祈祷
Well, that was a dumb thing to pray for

1237
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:25,307
我相信他会道歉的，他只是需要睡一觉
I'm sure he'll apologize He just needs to sleep it off

1238
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:27,777
卡梅伦不想让任何人看到他是个坏人，
Cameron doesn't want anyone to see him as a bad guy,

1239
01:05:27,779 --> 01:05:30,880
但是后来他喝醉了，变得好斗
but then he gets drunk and gets belligerent

1240
01:05:37,388 --> 01:05:42,561
我真厌倦了每个人都让我失望的生活
I'm really tired of everybody letting me down all the time

1241
01:05:44,362 --> 01:05:46,996
你应该得到更好的
You deserve better

1242
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:48,832
我是说
I mean

1243
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:50,734
艾莉森，你最酷，最漂亮，
Allyson, you're the coolest, you're the prettiest,

1244
01:05:50,736 --> 01:05:52,702
你是学校里最好的女孩
and you're the nicest girl in school

1245
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:54,404
如果有人不欣赏这一点，
And if anyone doesn't appreciate that,

1246
01:05:54,406 --> 01:05:56,874
那他一定是个疯子
they're a crazy person

1247
01:05:56,876 --> 01:05:58,308
谢谢你
Thank you

1248
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,445
你真暖心
That's very sweet

1249
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:05,315
让我们离开这里
Let's get out of here

1250
01:06:05,317 --> 01:06:07,350
我知道一条捷径
I know a shortcut

1251
01:06:07,352 --> 01:06:08,986
从临床角度来看，
From a clinical perspective,

1252
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:11,355
医生，你会说劳丽・斯特罗德
Doctor, would you say that Laurie Strode

1253
01:06:11,357 --> 01:06:12,890
失去理智了么？
has lost her fucking marbles?

1254
01:06:12,892 --> 01:06:15,059
悲剧和暴力有很多方式
There are many ways for tragedy and violence

1255
01:06:15,061 --> 01:06:16,861
改变受害者
to change a victim

1256
01:06:16,863 --> 01:06:20,464
他们会逐渐习惯担惊受怕
They can grow accustomed to always being afraid,

1257
01:06:20,466 --> 01:06:22,633
在不断的恐惧中
in constant fear

1258
01:06:22,635 --> 01:06:25,703
他们可能会变软弱，也可能会变强
They can grow weak, they can grow strong

1259
01:06:25,705 --> 01:06:27,873
但也有另一面
But there's also the other side

1260
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,373
什么另一面？
What other side is that?

1261
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,675
对凶手的影响
The effect on the victimizer

1262
01:06:31,677 --> 01:06:34,613
你看，这就是吸引我的地方
You see, this is what has intrigued me

1263
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,615
通过我的研究
through my studies

1264
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,651
像迈克尔这样的犯罪对他有何影响？
How does a crime like Michael's affect him?

1265
01:06:39,653 --> 01:06:43,588
嗯？那是什么感觉？
Hmm? What's that feeling?

1266
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:47,058
他是随机的，还是情绪化的
Is he on a random path, or is he emotionally driven?

1267
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,727
是什么触发的？
Triggered by something?

1268
01:06:48,729 --> 01:06:51,396
也许是一些闻所未闻的行军命令
Perhaps some unheard marching order

1269
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:53,765
印在他的灵魂里
imprinted on his very being

1270
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:55,901
我想知道他的感受
I want to know what he's feeling

1271
01:06:55,903 --> 01:06:59,504
我想知道他从杀戮中得到什么快乐
I want to know what pleasure he gets out of killing

1272
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:01,741
凶手在哪里？我们必须找到他
Where is this killer? We gotta find him

1273
01:07:01,743 --> 01:07:04,543
这次我不会妨碍公正正义了
I'm not gonna stand in the way of justice this time

1274
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:06,545
记住，他是国家财产
Remember, he's property of the state

1275
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:09,148
他不能受到伤害哦 - 是吗？
He mustn't be harmed -  Oh, yeah?

1276
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,551
走着瞧吧
We'll see about that

1277
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,585
这里不安全
It's not safe here

1278
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:45,152
艾莉森在哪里？
Where's Allyson?

1279
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:46,587
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1280
01:07:46,589 --> 01:07:48,121
艾莉森在哪里？！
Where's Allyson?!

1281
01:07:48,123 --> 01:07:49,957
亲爱的，我是妈妈，你能在收到信息
Honey, it's Mom Can you please call me back

1282
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:51,592
一刻立马给我回个电话么，求你了
the second that you get this, please?

1283
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:52,993
警察说他们撤离了舞会，
The police said that they evacuated the dance,

1284
01:07:52,995 --> 01:07:54,862
我联系不上你
and I can't get in touch with you

1285
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:56,597
他们要我们去你外婆家
And they're making us go to your grandmother's house

1286
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:57,865
那边是安全的
because it's safe

1287
01:07:57,867 --> 01:07:59,867
甜心，我是你外婆
Sweetheart, this is your grandmother

1288
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:02,170
有一名警察在你家等着把你
There is a police officer waiting at your house

1289
01:08:02,172 --> 01:08:03,872
带到我们身边
to bring you to us

1290
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:17,986
小心所有毒常春藤
Watch out for all the poison ivy

1291
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:19,821
别让我掉在上面 - 没问题，我抓住你了
Don't let me fall on that  - All right. I got you

1292
01:08:19,823 --> 01:08:21,589
我抓住你了。好了，我抓住你了好了，走吧
I got you. Okay, I got you Okay, go

1293
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:23,158
哦！行
Oh! Okay

1294
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,159
你做到了。耶
You did it. Yay

1295
01:08:24,161 --> 01:08:25,927
干得不错
Good job

1296
01:08:25,929 --> 01:08:27,129
耶
Yay

1297
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:28,529
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1298
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:30,632
我的意思是，你应该得到更好的
I mean, you deserve better

1299
01:08:30,634 --> 01:08:32,634
对吧？我是说 - 不
Right? I mean - No

1300
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:34,736
你他妈怎么回事？
What the fuck?

1301
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:35,905
我...那什么？你反正不再和卡梅隆在一起了
I-I... What? You're not with Cameron anymore

1302
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:37,907
这并不
That does not

1303
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:39,775
这并不意味着我想和你在一起
That does not mean I want to be with you

1304
01:08:39,777 --> 01:08:42,044
我以为...我以为你在给我暗示呢
I thought... I thought you were sending me signals

1305
01:08:42,046 --> 01:08:44,546
绝B没有信号这回事 - 我很抱歉
Definitely no signals - I'm so sorry

1306
01:08:44,548 --> 01:08:45,981
拜托，你不能告诉卡梅伦这件事
Please, you cannot tell Cameron about this

1307
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:47,883
我什么也没感觉到。我发誓
I-I didn't feel anything, either. I swear

1308
01:08:47,885 --> 01:08:49,919
我没有...等等，我没有。你真可怜
I didn't... Wait, I didn't You are so pathetic

1309
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:53,656
我要回家了，你可以自己搞清楚状况
I'm going home. You can figure your own shit out

1310
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:55,557
嘘...谁在那里？什么...嘿！
Sh... Who's there? Wha-What... Hey!

1311
01:08:55,559 --> 01:08:57,695
运动传感器，傻吊！
Motion sensor, dumb-ass!

1312
01:08:59,197 --> 01:09:00,931
艾莉森，我，
Allyson, I'm, like,

1313
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:03,166
真的喝醉了，真的
really drunk right now Seriously

1314
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:05,734
我在派对上非常兴奋，就像，
I got really horny at the party, and, like,

1315
01:09:05,736 --> 01:09:08,271
所有这些女孩都在我身上跳舞
all these girls were, like, dancing on me

1316
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:11,241
阿廖森，他们美丽的身体让我大吃一惊
Their beautiful bodies got me all chubbed out, Allyson

1317
01:09:11,243 --> 01:09:12,842
我..阿廖森，求你了！
I... Allyson, please!

1318
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:48,838
哦，操，那是...哦！
Oh, fuck, that was... Oh!

1319
00:57:49,906 --> 00:57:52,075
啊~sharia
Ah, sharia

1320
00:57:55,144 --> 00:57:58,313
你能关上壁橱门吗？
Uh, c-could you close the closet door?

1321
00:57:58,315 --> 00:58:00,084
是
Yeah

1322
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:16,465
哦，他妈的！
Oh, shit!

1323
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:18,867
哦，天哪
Oh, God

1324
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:20,235
不！
No!

1325
00:58:20,237 --> 00:58:22,037
哦！
Oh!

1326
01:08:03,874 --> 01:08:05,740
我们会在一起的
We're all gonna be together

1327
01:08:05,742 --> 01:08:07,842
现在，照我说的做
Now, do as I say

1328
01:08:07,844 --> 01:08:09,911
哦，妈的
Oh, shit

1329
01:08:09,913 --> 01:08:11,478
这玩意真危险
It's treacherous as hell here

1330
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,747
好吧，你还好吗？
Okay You good?

1331
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:14,148
扶着我的手
Take my hand Okay

1332
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,850
在这儿 - 这是有史以来最愚蠢的捷径
Right here - This is the dumbest shortcut ever

1333
01:09:12,844 --> 01:09:15,145
他们，就像他们喂我吃鳄梨酱一样
They, like they were feeding me guacamole

1334
01:09:15,147 --> 01:09:18,148
以及其他性感的方式
in all these sexy ways

1335
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,885
这不是我的~
It's not my

1336
01:09:29,528 --> 01:09:31,963
万圣节快乐，埃尔罗德先生，我只是
Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod I'm-I'm just

1337
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:33,663
我不知道，伙计。对不起
I don't know, man. I'm sorry

1338
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:36,033
我不想跑进你的院子拉屎之类的，伙计
I'm not trying to trespass on your yard and shit, man

1339
01:09:36,035 --> 01:09:38,035
我只是想走捷径
I was just trying to take a shortcut

1340
01:09:38,037 --> 01:09:40,104
和一个非常漂亮的女孩在一起，我只是
with a really pretty girl, and I just

1341
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:41,973
我真的很喜欢她，伙计，
I just really like her, man,

1342
01:09:41,975 --> 01:09:44,075
我原以为她也喜欢我
and I-I thought that she liked me, too

1343
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:45,643
我只是...只是
And I just... it just

1344
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:47,278
你真的喜欢过一个女孩吗
Have you ever really liked a girl

1345
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,082
可你就是不能拥有她？
and you just couldn't have her?

1346
01:09:50,283 --> 01:09:51,949
我是...对不起，伙计
I'm s... I'm sorry, man

1347
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:54,051
我只是...我会安静的离开的，伙计
I'll just... I'll peace out of your hair, man

1348
01:09:54,053 --> 01:09:57,724
谢谢-谢谢你
Thank-thank you for

1349
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,865
嘿，呃
Hey, uh

1350
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:08,733
你去哪了，伙计？你在演戏么
where'd you go, man? You're acting

1351
01:10:08,735 --> 01:10:10,634
伙计，你在演戏，好像
Dude, you're acting, like,

1352
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:12,740
很浮夸 我不
really sketchy right now I don't

1353
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:15,042
呃
Uh

1354
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:19,211
怎么了？
What's up?

1355
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:24,218
我...我...我要走了，我不
I'm-I'm-I'm leaving right I don't

1356
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:26,754
我是
I'm

1357
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:38,231
噢！哦，我的上帝！啊！啊！
Ow! Oh, my God! Aah! Aah!

1358
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:39,298
救命！救命！
Help me! Help!

1359
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,632
求你了！有人么！
Please! Somebody!

1360
01:10:40,634 --> 01:10:42,068
来人啊，救命啊！
Somebody, help me, please!

1361
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,770
来人，求你了！拜托，有人！
Somebody, please! Please, somebody!

1362
01:34:49,429 --> 01:34:51,196
一切都会好起来的
Everything's going to be okay

1363
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:31,505
妈妈，我很抱歉
Mom, I'm so sorry

1364
01:35:31,507 --> 01:35:33,307
我试图阻止他来这里
I tried to stop him from coming here

1365
01:35:48,324 --> 01:35:50,558
好吧。行
Okay. Okay
