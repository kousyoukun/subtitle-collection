You're not cold or anything, are you?

8
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,420
感覺都好嗎
Everything all right?

9
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,460
你有在吃藥嗎
Are you taking any medication?

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,070
謝謝
Thank you.

11
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,700
今天早上感覺怎麼樣
How are you doing this morning?

12
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,940
昨天晚上睡得安穩嗎
Did you have a restful sleep last night?

13
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,470
嗯
Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,610
-是嗎  -是的
- You did? - I did.

15
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,440
-有做夢嗎  -沒有
- Any dreams? - Nope.

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,980
有時候人會不記得自己的夢
Sometimes we don't remember our dreams, you know?

17
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
是的
That's right.

18
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,840
其實我們做夢了  只是醒來時
We do dream, but we don't remember

19
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,680
-都不記得了  -是的
- when we wake up. - No.

20
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,510
但如果是在醒來前
But if we are dreaming some

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,680
剛做的夢  那我們就記得
just before we wake up, we remember those.

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,820
是的
That's right.

23
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,220
你知不知道
Did you know...

24
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,760
一個...  有用的小知識
A little, uh... uh, useful information.

25
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,090
我們醒來時
When we wake up

26
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,760
說"我一整晚
and say, "The whole night,

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,560
都在做夢  夢到了這個那個"
I was dreaming this and that and everything,"

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
其實最多四十五分鐘
it's only 45 minutes maximum.

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,230
-你知道這個嗎  -不知道
- Did you know that? - Yeah. No, I did not. Yeah.

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,170
一般的夢只有十到十五分鐘長
So the ordinary dream is ten or 15 minutes.

31
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,940
下回見
I'll see you all later.

32
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,480
-你要去哪裡  -我要去見病人
- Where are you going? - I'm going to see my patients.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,740
測試  測試
Testing. Testing.

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,110
測試  測試  測試  一二三
Check, check, check. One, two, three.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,710
測試  一二三
Testing. One, two, three.

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,880
我們現在在史密斯格羅夫
We are now at Smith's Grove,

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,990
一家康復機構
uh, rehabilitation facility.

38
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,020
我們今天過來是想採訪一位
We're here today to interview a patient

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,190
在這裡關了四十年的病人
that's spent the last 40 years in captivity

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,660
據人們說  他在此期間一言未發
and, by all accounts, has not uttered a word.

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,700
這個惡魔...
This monster...

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,140
-下午好  -下午好
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,640
我是蘭比爾·薩頓醫生
I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.

44
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,110
很高興終於見到您了
Great to finally meet you.

45
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,980
感謝您今天抽空見我們
Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us today.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,680
我們一直希望能在他被轉移到
We were hoping to have this opportunity

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,910
另一家機構之前採訪到他
before he's transferred to the new facility.

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
玻璃山那邊遠沒有這麼寬容
Glass Hill is far less accommodating.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,820
玻璃山就是地獄火坑
Glass Hill is the pit of hell.

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,550
多年來  他作為研究對像被關在這裡
For years, he's been kept here to be studied.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,590
我想州政府已經喪失興趣
I suppose the state has lost interest

52
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,890
不想再繼續探究了
in discovering anything further.

53
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,790
因此我們來了
Well, that's why we're here.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
我畢生執迷於研究邁克爾
Michael has been my life's obsession.

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,570
我查閱了每一本關於他的案卷
I've examined every single case file written on him.

56
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,840
盧米斯醫生去世之前  我是他的學生
I was a student of Dr. Loomis before he passed away.

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,040
後來我遊說伊利諾伊大學
And then I lobbied the University of Illinois

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,570
將我分配來研究邁克爾
to be assigned to Michael myself.

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,040
有什麼進展嗎
Any progress?

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,580
有超過五十個臨床精神病學家來看過他
Well, he's been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,980
每個人都有不同的觀點
and with each, many different opinions.

62
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,050
盧米斯醫生是唯一一個在外頭見到他的
Dr. Loomis was the only one to see him in the wild.

63
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,990
他斷言邁克爾是純粹的邪惡
And he concluded he was nothing more than pure evil.

64
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,060
我們的病人能呼吸新鮮空氣  沐浴陽光
Our patients get fresh air, sunshine,

65
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,600
能看到風景  有適當的鍛煉  還有健康食譜
a view, proper exercise, healthy diet.

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,730
我很難過看到他被轉去
It pains me to see him transferred

67
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,600
那家低於期望的機構
to that less-than-desirable facility.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,740
那就是他
And there he is.

69
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,140
他會說話
He can speak.

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,870
只是不想說
He just chooses not to.

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,010
如果可以的話  我想離他近一點
I'd love to stand closer to him, if I may.

72
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,020
看看他是否有意識  或是缺乏意識
Get a sense of his awareness, or lack of awareness.

73
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,150
別搞錯了  他意識非常靈敏
Oh, make no mistake, he's aware.

74
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,250
你們一到  他就在觀察你們了
He was watching you as you arrived.

75
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,160
不如你把你的左腳的鞋帶綁好吧
Perhaps you'd like to tie your left shoelace?

76
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,930
這位撐著雨傘的托沃利先生
Mr. Tovoli here, the gentleman with the umbrella,

77
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,200
對這種事有強迫癥
has a fixation for such things.

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,070
不要小看任何人
Underestimate no one.

79
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,140
好的
Of course.

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
走到黃線處
And now step up to the yellow line.

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,780
不能再靠近了
And no further.

82
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,980
任何情況下都不要越線
Do not cross the line under any circumstances.

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,220
邁克爾

84
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,320
邁克爾
Michael.

85
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,920
這裡有人想要見見你
I've got some people who'd like to meet you.

86
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,200
你好  邁克爾
Hello, Michael.

87
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,800
我叫亞倫·科裡
My name is Aaron Korey.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,930
我已經追蹤你的案子很多年了
I've been following your case for years

89
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,300
依然對你知之甚少
and still know very little about you.

90
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,240
我想知道更多
I'd like to know more.

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
關於那個晚上
About that night.

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,220
關於事件中的那些人
About those involved.

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,420
你有想過他們嗎  邁克爾
Do you ever think about them, Michael?

94
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,260
有對他們的死感到愧疚嗎
Feel guilt about their fate?

95
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,910
我從一個在檢察總長辦公室的
I borrowed something from a friend

96
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,210
朋友那裡借了個東西  邁克爾
at the attorney general's office, Michael.

97
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,830
你感覺到了  對嗎  邁克爾
You feel it, don't you, Michael?

98
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,440
你感覺到面具了
You feel the mask.

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,840
費加羅  費加羅

100
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,190

說句話
Say something.

102
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,470
你感覺到了  對嗎
You can feel it, can't you?

103
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,510
它是你的一部分  邁克爾
It's a part of you, Michael.

104
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,080
它是你的一部分
It's a part of you.

好了
Okay, well,

111
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,180
我們目睹了這頭禽獸處於俘虜狀態
having witnessed the animal in its captive state

112
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,450
我們沒有引起他的任何反應

我們現在要追蹤他的同類

是這樣的
So...

142
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,540
亞倫和我製作了幾部
Aaron and I have made several

143
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,710
獲過獎的公共電臺揭秘節目
award-winning public radio exposes.

144
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,280
我們的上一個節目為一樁
Our last project shed new light

145
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,050
二十年前的謀殺案找尋到了新的線索
on a murder case from 20 years ago.

146
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,360
我們會不帶偏見地重新審視案件
We like to reexamine incidents with an unbiased lens.

147
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,190
我想關於你遭受的恐怖事件
I believe there's a lot to learn

148
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,660
還有很多可以講述的
from the horrors you experienced.

149
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,760
沒什麼可講的
There's nothing to learn.

150
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,770
沒有新的見解
There are no new insights

151
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,400
或是發現了
or discoveries.

152
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,100
那他是真的嗎
So, is he real?

153
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,710
誰
Who?

154
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,810
惡巫
The Boogeyman.

155
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,380
我讀到你當時說...
I read you quoted...

156
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,390
你不相信有惡巫
You don't believe in the Boogeyman?

157
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,170
我相信有邁克爾·邁爾斯這樣的瘋狂連環殺手
I believe in Michael Myers, deranged serial killer,

158
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,280
但是
but...

159
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,520
我不相信有惡巫
the Boogeyman, no.

160
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,690
你該信的
Well, you should.

161
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,730
好吧
Okay.

162
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,200
邁克爾·邁爾斯是一個
Michael Myers is a human being

163
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,870
在六歲時就殺了他妹妹的人
who killed his sister when he was six years old.

164
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,570
後來他開始追殺你
Then he came after you.

165
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,670
我們只想知道原因
We just want to know why.

166
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,570
我們想一窺他的思維
We want a glimpse inside his mind.

167
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,140
所以你的故事格外重要
That's why your story is so important.

168
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,150
我的故事
My story?

169
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,680
兩段失敗的婚姻
Two failed marriages.

170
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,620
你和女兒與外孫女之間緊張的關係
Rocky relationship with your daughter and granddaughter.

171
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,690
邁克爾·邁爾斯殺了五個人
Michael Myers murdered five people.

172
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,430
我們必須要理解這樣的人嗎
And he's a human being we need to understand?

173
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,700
我離婚了兩次
I'm twice divorced.

174
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,670
我無依無靠
And I'm a basket case.

175
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,200
他們要將他轉移走了
They're transferring him.

176
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,610
明天七點
Tomorrow, 7:00.

177
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,810
他餘生都會被關在那裡
He'll-he'll be locked away until the end of his days.

178
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,550
這才對
That's the idea.

179
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,150
我們來談談州政府
Let's talk about when the state came

180
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,720
將你女兒帶走的時候
to take your daughter away.

181
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,450
她當時十二歲
She was 12 years old.

182
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,760
他們說你是個不合格的母親
They said you were an unfit mother.

183
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,590
你多久後才重新拿回監護權
How long until you regained custody?

184
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,830
我沒拿回來
I didn't.

185
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,770
不過你們早就知道了
But you already knew that.

186
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,400
勞瑞  我們見到他了
Laurie, we saw him.

187
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,810
我們見到邁克爾了
We met with Michael.

188
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,240
我給他看了面具
I showed him the mask.

189
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,210
結果什麼也沒有
There was nothing.

190
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,030
沒有回應  什麼也沒有
No response. Nothing.

191
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,920
他不和任何人說話
He won't talk to anyone.

192
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,420
從沒說過  但是
Never has, but...

193
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,410
我覺得他可能會願意跟你說話
I think he might speak with you.

194
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,220
所以不如你和他坐下來
So, why don't you sit down with him

195
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,840
把你一直以來渴望說的話都說給他聽
and say all the things you must be longing to say.

196
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,230
跟我們走
Come with us,

197
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,400
讓我們幫你釋放自己
and let us help you free yourself.

198
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,840
拜託了
Please.

199
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,850
時間到了
Time's up.

200
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,520
我會收下報酬
I'll accept my payment.

201
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,860
出去
Get out.

202
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,390
你想在我的水槽下拉屎
You want to shit under my sink?

203
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,960
我會殺了你和你全家
I will murder you and your whole family.

204
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,740
我把棉花軟糖換成花生醬了
I switched from marshmallow fluff to peanut butter.

205
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,540
看那些小混蛋會不會吃
See if those little bastards eat that.

206
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,310
-這應該能把它們滅了  -早
- That ought to kill them. - Morning.

207
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,940
我重新安排了最後療程的時間  今晚我能去了
I rescheduled my last session, so I can make it tonight.

208
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,510
真沒必要  媽媽
You really didn't have to do that, Mom.

209
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,910
不是什麼大事
It's not a big deal.

210
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,550
你成為了高中榮譽生
You made it into the National Honor Society.

211
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,880
-沒錯  -這可是件天大的事
- Yeah. - That is a very big deal.

212
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,920
我只能在木工課上拿優秀
I just made it to the top of my shop class,

213
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,950
靠的是製作鳥屋  還有一個用柚木做的棋盤
making birdhouses and, uh, a checkerboard made of teak.

214
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,820
我們迫不及待想見卡梅倫了
We're excited to meet Cameron.

215
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,960
他們一家  名氣很大
That whole family, though, they had a reputation.

216
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,730
-雷  別這樣  -是真的
- Ray, come on. - But it's true.

217
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,400
-這也是一個重要因素  -雷
- It's a relevant factor. - Ray.

218
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,000
-雷  -你記得那次洛尼
- Ray. - Do you remember the one time Lonnie

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,030
往那個警察臉上揍了一拳嗎
punched that cop in the face?

220
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,330
-雷  -那真是...
- Ray. - That was a...

221
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,840
媽蛋
Oh! Mother...

222
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,600
天啊
Oh, man!

223
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,610
屌上粘到花生醬了
I got peanut butter on my penis.

224
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,040
真噁心  爸
Ew, Dad.

225
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,330
報應來得真快
Instant karma.

226
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,450
卡梅倫是個好男人  他跟他父母不一樣
Cameron is a good guy. He's nothing like that.

227
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,830
今晚你們見到他就知道了
You're gonna see when you meet him tonight.

228
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,620
男人搞大你肚子之前都是好男人
They're all nice guys until they get you pregnant,

229
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,920
然後你就坐進了他們的卡車
and then you gotta drive in their pickup trucks,

230
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,550
給他們擦槍  然後你有了孩子
and you clean their guns, and you got children,

231
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,590
你給他們擦槍  跟他們一起吸毒
and you clean guns, and you like to get high with them,

232
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,860
然後你們都變得很肥
and then y'all get fat.

233
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,960
爸爸
Hey, Dad?

234
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,460
-怎麼  -你能不能別說了
- What? - Can you stop?

235
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,810
我得去把手上的花生醬洗掉
I gotta clean this peanut butter off my hand.

236
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,680
你說過你要邀請外婆  你請她了嗎
Did you invite Grandmother like you said you would?

237
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,380
今晚  你說你會...
About tonight. You said that you'd...

238
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,950
...邀請她
...invite her.

239
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,350
對  我跟她說了
Right. I did.

240
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,980
-是嗎  -對
- You did? - Yeah.

241
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,650
我昨天跟她說了
I talked to her yesterday.

242
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,860
她沒法來  親愛的  抱歉
She's not gonna be able to come, honey. I'm sorry.

243
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,060
真的嗎
Really?

244
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,890
真的
Yeah.

245
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,390
寶貝  她有廣場恐懼癥
Baby, she's agoraphobic.

246
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,220
她需要接受認知行為療法
She needs cognitive behavioral therapy,

247
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,760
你別往心裡去
so don't take it personally.

248
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,970
是薇琪來了  我得走了
That's Vicky. I gotta go.

249
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,770
我愛你
Hey, I love you.

250
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,510
過得愉快
Have a good day.

251
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,910
-再見  爸  我愛你  -好
- Bye, Dad. Love you. - Okay.

252
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,580
我媽是個騙子
So, my mom's a liar.

253
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,480
怎麼了
What happened?

254
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,850
她說會邀請外婆
She said that she invited

255
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,750
今晚過來  但是她沒有
my grandmother tonight, but she didn't.

256
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,550
她甚至都沒聯繫她
I mean, she never even contacted her.

257
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,090
-你怎麼知道的  -因為我給她打了電話
- How do you know? - Because I called her myself.

258
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,860
-真是亂來  -是啊
- That's bullshit. - Yeah.

259
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,930
你媽怎麼想的  她為什麼這麼說
Dude, what's your mom's deal? Why would she say that?

260
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,400
我不知道  她不想讓我見外婆
I don't know. She just tries to keep me away from her.

261
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,700
每到每年的這個時候
Everyone in my family, like,

262
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,870
我家裡人感覺都會變成徹頭徹尾的瘋子
turns into a total nutcase this time of year.

263
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,940
要是我是你們  我也不會慶祝這鬼日子
If I were you guys, I wouldn't celebrate, either.

264
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,640
我會選擇打扮聖誕樹
I would just put up a Christmas tree instead.

265
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,540
跳過詭異的萬聖節  對吧
Just skip all over the creepy Halloween shit, right?

266
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,910
你外婆說過那件事嗎
Does your grandma ever talk about it?

267
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,080
說過  她翻來覆去就在說那件事
Yeah, it's pretty much all she talks about.

268
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,450
那基本就是她的一生了
It defines her life.

269
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,420
自那以後她就一直活在創傷中
She's been traumatized ever since.

270
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,520
是不是她哥哥
Wasn't it her brother who, like,

271
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,120
那個冷血兇手殺了那些少年
cold-blooded murdilated all those teenagers?

272
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,560
不是
No.

273
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,520
我覺得那只是人們編造出來
That's just a bit that some people made up

274
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,960
安慰他們自己的
to make them feel better, I think.

275
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,630
一個不知哪裡來的瘋子
I mean, that is scary to have a bunch of your friends

276
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,960
殺了你一幫朋友  這太恐怖了
get butchered by some random crazy person.

277
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,870
是嗎  因為總的來說
Is it, though? Because, all things considered,

278
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,740
現在社會上有很多更壞的事發生
there's a lot worse stuff that's happening today.

279
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,170
我是說  一個人拿刀子
And, like, I mean, what, a couple people getting killed

280
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,790
殺了幾個人不算什麼大事
by one guy with a knife is not that big of a deal.

281
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,540
老兄  她外婆可是差點被殺了
Dude, her grandmother was almost fucking murdered.

282
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,300
她逃脫了  兇手被抓
And she escaped, and they caught him,

283
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,110
他被關在牢裡了
and now he's incarcerated.

284
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
我只是跟現在社會上的情況對比...
I-I'm just saying, like, by today's standards...

285
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,090
你他媽閉嘴吧  戴夫
Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

286
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,620
別說了
Shut up.

287
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,930
對不起  你說得對  不說了
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, shut up, Dave.

288
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,590
你們不介意
Hey, is it cool with you guys

289
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,160
我炸掉一個南瓜燈吧
if I explode one of these pumpkin heads?

290
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
-行吧  -你炸吧
- Yeah. Yeah. - Go for it.

291
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,860
他玩兒真的嗎
Oh, he's serious?

292
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,800
-玩兒真的  -老天  他真的要炸南瓜燈
- He's serious. - Oh, God, he's really blowing it up.

293
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
是吧  這個白癡
I know. He's such a fucking moron.

294
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,970
-天啊  天啊  -天啊
- Oh, God. Oh, God. - Oh, Jesus.

295
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,040
走走走  快走
Go, go, go, go, go.

296
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,970
萬聖節快樂
Happy Halloween!

297
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,480
卡梅倫
Cameron.

298
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,110
我嚇到你了  是不是很可怕
I got you. That was a good one.

299
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,480
對  嚇我一跳
Yes, that was very good.

300
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,710
你準備好明晚
Hey, do you have everything

301
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,220
要穿的衣服了嗎
for your costume tomorrow night?

302
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,890
畢竟雌雄大盜可是完美的一對
Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one, after all.

303
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,880
沒有  我把心思都放在了今晚
No, I mean, I-I'm more focused on tonight.

304
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,660
今晚
Tonight?

305
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,490
我  我以為你說你父母作風很老派
I-I thought you were joking when you said

306
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,970
是開玩笑的呢
your parents were old-fashioned.

307
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,160
-表現好一點  -行吧
- Be nice, okay? - Okay.

308
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,760
會很有意思的
It'll be fun.

309
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,700
-我很期待今晚  -我需要冷靜
- I'm excited for tonight. - I need to calm down.

310
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,900
-我很期待今晚  好嗎  -好
- I'm excited for tonight, okay? - Okay.

311
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,670
你倆真噁心
Ugh. You guys are just barf, you know.

312
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,480
你們...  你們這倆噁心的垃圾桶
You're just... you're two yucky dumpsters,

313
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,780
-我只想跳進來  來吧  -不要
- and I want to go diving. Come here. Mwah! - No.

314
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,750
-老兄  老兄  -來吧  來吧
- Dude, dude. - Right here, right here, right?

315
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,070
老兄  你  你把
Dude, you-you got

316
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,150
你嘴上的死皮
your little chapped-lip crusties

317
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,620
蹭了我一臉  謝了
all over me, man, so thanks.

318
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,090
我知道  不用謝
I know. And you're welcome.

319
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,830
-真噁心  -我把我身體的一部分送給你了
- It's gross. - It's a little part of me for you.

320
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,660
伴你這一天
For the rest of your day.

321
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,990
你準備好
All right? So, do you have

322
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,660
明天的衣服了嗎
everything ready for your costume tomorrow?

323
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,730
-關於那個...  -怎麼了
- Um... about that... - What?

324
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,500
你在逗我嗎
Are we seriously not?

325
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,840
你說了我們萬聖節舞會一起跳舞
You said we were gonna do this whole Halloween dance together.

326
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,900
結果你要拋棄我
Now-now you just... you ditch me.

327
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,240
你真是...  你不能到處
I mean, you just... you-you can't walk

328
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,940
-傷別人的心  -好了  好了
- all over town breaking hearts. - Okay, okay, okay.

329
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,080
-聽著  聽著  -知道嗎
- Hey, listen, listen. - All right?

330
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,940
-我們是真愛  -好吧  愛情鳥  回見
- Love. Truly. - Okay, lovebirds, later.

331
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,550
將課本翻至
Now let's open our books to...

332
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,610
弗蘭克爾的解析
Frankl's interpretation.

333
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,240
他說"命運走向了不同的道路
He said, "Fate took a different course.

334
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,800
我明白為何在世上一無所有的人
I understand how someone who has nothing left in this world

335
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,630
依然會懂得幸福的意義"
may still know bliss."

336
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,100
他的表達是充滿希望的
His message is totally hopeful.

337
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,800
即使在被輕蔑的時候
Even in the most disparaging of conditions,

338
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,640
人生依然能夠找到意義
life can find its meaning,

339
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,280
反之  一個人的痛苦也是如此
and conversely, so can one's suffering.

340
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,240
我
I...

341
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,720
我不能收
can't accept this.

342
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,980
你可以用在你想要的地方
Use it for whatever your heart desires.

343
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,250
那我要存起來上大學
I'll save it for college, then.

344
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,750
去他的大學
Fuck college.

345
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,820
離開這裡  去墨西哥
Go somewhere. Go to Mexico.

346
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,290
你能想像到嗎
Could you imagine?

347
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,150
是的
Yeah, I can.

348
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,740
聽著  不用擔心你媽
Look, don't worry about your mom.

349
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,240
她會氣瘋
She will freak.

350
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,700
但她會好起來的
But she'll get over it.

351
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,610
那你為什麼做不到
Why can't you?

352
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,680
那惡巫呢
The Boogeyman?

353
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,280
你的躲藏  準備
All this hiding, all this preparation,

354
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,950
都毫無意義了
it was for nothing.

355
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,190
你把這件事看得比家人還重要
I mean, it took priority over your family.

356
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,160
讓你失去了家人
It cost you your family.

357
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,130
你媽媽因為我撫養她的方式而恨我
If the way I raised your mother means that she hates me...

358
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,030
但那也意味著她已經
...but that she's prepared

359
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,600
做好了面對恐怖世界的準備  那麼
for the horrors of this world, then...

360
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,170
我可以接受
I can live with that.

361
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,780
跟邁克爾告別  然後放下吧
Say good-bye to Michael, and get over it.

362
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,120
再見
Good-bye.

363
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,380
塞繆爾·盧米斯醫生
Dr. Samuel Loomis,

364
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,920
1979年1月22日
January 22, 1979.

365
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,120
您是否想就你的前病患
Do you wish to give a statement regarding

366
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,190
邁克爾·邁爾斯發表陳述
your former patient, Michael Myers?

367
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,200
我的建議是死刑
My suggestion is termination.

368
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,660
只有死亡才能解決邁克爾的問題
Death is the only solution for Michael.

369
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,430
A2201  邁克爾·邁爾斯
A2201. Myers, Michael.

370
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,370
-往前走  排好隊  -讓一個惡魔活著
- Toes in line. Keep a line. - There's nothing

371
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,940
-沒有任何好處  -舉起手來
- to be gained from keeping evil alive. - Hands up!

372
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,110
舉起手來  站起來
Hands up! Stand up!

373
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,910
A22
A22...

374
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,810
一劑硫噴妥鈉
A shot of sodium thiopental

375
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,850
會使他失去意識
would render him unconscious.

376
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,140
-A22  -我會在旁陪同來確保
- A22... - I'll be with him to make sure

377
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,890
他的生命之火熄滅
his life is extinguished.

378
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,720
我會親自聽著他的心跳停止
My ear on his chest to hear for myself

379
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,760
他的器官停止運作
that his vitals no longer function

380
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,740
並且立刻焚化屍體
and immediately incinerate the body.

381
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,270
它必須死
It needs to die.

382
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,740
它必須死
It needs to die!

383
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,190
它必須死
It needs to die!

384
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,950
繼續走  走
Keep moving. Let's go.

385
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,860
別擔心  邁克爾
Don't worry, Michael.

386
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,630
我會陪在你身邊
I'll be by your side.

387
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,170
在其他人接收他之前
Michael Myers is still my patient

388
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,240
邁克爾·邁爾斯依然是我的病人
until he's in somebody else's care,

389
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,010
我會負責到最後一刻
so I'm seeing my duty through till the end.

390
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,810
{\an8}勞教所

391
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,180
好了  開車
All right, move out.

392
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,410
把我的DNA寄給陌生人
...send my DNA away to a stranger.

393
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,410
為什麼不呢  你會發現很多有趣的事
Why not? You can find out some pretty interesting things.

394
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,080
-別...  -我發現我有徹羅基族人的血統
- Don't... - I found out that I'm part Cherokee.

395
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,280
我猜是我爸傳給我的  7%的徹羅基族人血統
I guess my dad's, like, seven percent Cherokee.

396
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,950
我認識洛尼  我們一起上的高中
I know Lonnie. I went to high school with him.

397
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,240
-他以前賣過我致幻仙人掌  -爸
- He used to sell me peyote. - Dad.

398
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,190
-人人都認識洛尼  -爸
- Everyone knows Lonnie. - Dad.

399
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,390
-抱歉  -好了
- I'm sorry. - All right. Um...

400
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,220
對我們的新朋友來說
this is a massive overshare

401
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,490
信息量太大了
for our new friend.

402
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,120
我跟他爸一起  更加認識了自己
I learned a lot about myself with his dad.

403
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,460
-我和他爸在樹林裡嗑嗨了暈頭轉向  -爸
- Tripped balls out in the woods, me and his dad. - Dad.

404
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,760
-雷  -嗑嗨了暈頭轉向
- Boy, Ray... - Tripping balls.

405
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,160
爸
Dad!

406
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,930
不是的  繼續說啊
No, really, keep talking.

407
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,430
你們明天在學校
So, you guys have big plans for tomorrow

408
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,270
-有什麼大活動嗎  -你們要幹什麼

Costume party.

412
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,040
你們要扮成誰
What are you going as?

413
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,110
我不知道能不能說
Uh, well, I don't know if I'm allowed to say.

414
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,110
-說吧  -說吧
- Please say. - Oh, come on.

415
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,350
-說吧  -可以嗎  好吧
- Come on. - I can...? Okay.

416
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,850
我們要扮成雌雄大盜邦妮和克萊德
Uh, so we're going as Bonnie and Clyde.

417
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,050
-這點子不錯  -對
- Oh, that's a great idea. - Yeah.

418
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,000
不過...
Except...

419
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,120
不
Oh. No.

420
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,320
好吧  就是雌雄大盜了
Okay, so just Bonnie and Clyde.

421
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,390
就這個  雌雄大盜
That's it. Bonnie and Clyde.

422
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,560
改進版的邦妮和克萊德
Bonnie and Clyde with a twist.

423
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,990
-經典  -沒錯
- Classic. - Yeah!

424
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,120
-我覺得很好  -很好
- I love that. - Nice.

425
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,260
真有意思
That's so fun.

426
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,490
你知道邦妮和克萊德的結局吧
You know how it ended, right?

427
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,200
-他們的結局有點...  -是的  希望...
- Their story ended a little... - Yes. Hopefully...

428
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,830
他們的結局充斥著子彈和鮮血
Yes, with the bullets and the bleeding.

429
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,200
-是啊  -你有一輛
- Yeah. - You have a jalopy

430
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,120
被聯調局打成篩子的老爺車嗎
filled with bullet holes from the G-men?

431
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,440
我真希望我們能有
I wish we had one of those.

432
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,470
-車在勞克林  是福特A型車  -我知道
- It was in Laughlin, like a Model A. - I know.

433
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,870
你聯繫外婆了嗎
Did you talk to Grandmother?

434
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,910
嗯
Yeah.

435
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,540
她說她會來
She said she was gonna come.

436
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,010
她來我辦公室了  我們聊了一會兒
She came to my office. We had a nice talk.

437
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,320
是嗎  真的嗎
Did you? Really?

438
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,120
-這倒是頭一回  -聊得不錯
- That's a first. - It was nice.

439
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,550
那你知道她現在在哪兒嗎
Do you know where she is, then?

440
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,590
-抱歉  抱歉我來晚...  -那個嘛...
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I... - That part...

441
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,290
-正好  媽  -我
- Great timing, Mom. Hi. - Uh, I...

442
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,420
-你來了  -我遲了  抱歉
- You made it. - It ran late. I'm sorry.

443
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,230
-你能來太好了  -你好  媽媽
- Hi. I'm so happy you came. - Hi, Mom.

- Hi. Hi. I'm, uh... - Hi.

445
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,030
我是她外婆
I'm the grandmother.

446
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,110
很高興見到您  我是卡梅倫·埃蘭
Nice to meet you. I'm Cameron Elam.

447
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,000
我們今天是來慶祝
And we're here celebrating our daughter

448
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,540
-我們女兒獲得了...  -我知道
- because of her... - Yes, I know.

449
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,040
怎麼樣了
How did it go?

450
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,210
你戴著很好看
Yes. It looks good on you.

451
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,170
知道嗎  我也進過高中榮譽生會
You know, I was in the Honor Society, too.

452
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,310
那很好  你不如坐下吧  媽
That's good. Why don't you sit down, Mom?

453
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,310
-不用了  -對  坐下吧
- No, I'm good. - Yeah, have a seat.

454
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,050
或者你願意的話  我們可以出去散散步
Or we could go for a walk, if you'd like.

455
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,150
-是嗎  很順利嗎  -是的
- Really? Did it go great? Yeah? - Yeah.

456
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,310
很順利  非常...
It went really... it went, um...

457
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,980
-媽  -那是我的
- Hey, Mom? - That's mine.

458
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,380
我以為你已經戒酒了
I thought you quit drinking.

459
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,670
媽  你在幹什麼  這是幹什麼
Mom, what are you doing? What is this?

460
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,390
知道嗎  就是因為這樣我們才不聯繫你
You know, this is exactly why we don't reach out.

461
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,130
媽
Mom.

462
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,300
抱歉  我會坐下的
I'm sorry. I will sit down.

463
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,160
好吧
Okay.

464
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,350
那我們就重來一遍
Why don't we press the reset button?

465
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,900
從頭開始  好嗎
Why don't we just start over, okay?

466
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,210
媽
All right, Mom...

467
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,610
-對不起  -媽
- Sorry. - Mom.

468
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,440
拜託停下
Please stop this.

469
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,220
對不起
Sorry.

470
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,650
我看到他了
I saw him.

471
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,120
看到了模糊的影子
The Shape.

472
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
-媽  -我想殺了他
- Mom... - I wanted to kill him.

473
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,220
好了  夠了  勞瑞
Okay, that's enough, Laurie.

474
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,060
-勞瑞  別說了  -我不知道該怎麼辦
- Laurie, that's enough. - I didn't know what to do.

475
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,590
-夠了  勞瑞  -好了
- That's enough, Laurie. - Okay.

476
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,360
我覺得你有點承受不住了
I think maybe this is a little bit too much for you, huh?

477
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,270
不如我們去外面走走  好嗎
Why don't we go for a walk, all right?

478
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,230
你說你想要
You said you were gonna try

479
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,970
-放下過去  -勞瑞
- to put the past behind you. - Laurie.

480
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,930
你要努力試一試嗎
Okay? Are you gonna try to do that?

481
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,040
你說你想要這麼做
That's what you said you wanted to do.

482
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
我做不到
I can't.

483
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,640
媽  看著我
Mom, look at me.

484
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,980
看著我
Look at me.

485
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,350
-我...  -我們是不是應該...
- I... - Should we, uh...

486
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,110
我很不想說"我告訴過你了"  但是...
...really hate to say I told you so, but...

487
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,020
我很高興也能讓你看看這一幕
I'm glad you got to see that.

488
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,400
我從來沒告訴過你我的童年是怎麼度過的
I never told you how I spent my childhood.

489
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,300
抓到你了
Gotcha.

490
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,170
我八歲時學會了怎麼用槍
I learned how to shoot a gun when I was eight.

491
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,070
我學會了如何戰鬥
I learned how to fight.

492
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,040
地下室裡滿是我的噩夢
I had nightmares about the basement.

493
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,050
社會服務部門在我十二歲時來帶走了我
Social Services came when I was 12 years old and took me away.

494
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,160
我這輩子都在努力擺脫她強加到我身上的
I've spent my entire life trying to get over the paranoia

495
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,970
恐慌和神經質
and neuroses that she has projected on me.

496
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,130
他有點讓我想起了
Yeah, he kind of reminds me

497
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,500
蓋瑞·霍格布姆
of, uh, Gary Hogeboom.

498
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,330
對  那四分衛真是完蛋了
Yeah, that quarterback thing is all messed up.

499
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,470
來得正好  對嗎
Good times, right?

500
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
她一個人能怎麼辦呢
What is she gonna do with herself?

501
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,640
沒事  拯救她不是你的責任
I know. It's not your job to save her.

502
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,810
她不會有事的
She'll be all right.

503
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,910
自從洗車把天線折斷了
I can't get reception on this thing

504
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,200
這個廣播就接收不到信息了
ever since the antenna was bent at the car wash.

505
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,220
我們為什麼又要出來
Why do we have to come out again?

506
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,490
我們明明成天出來打獵
We do this all the time.

507
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,120
什麼  你...你不喜歡嗎
What? You don't... you don't enjoy it?

508
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,590
我喜歡去樹林裡
I-I like being out in the woods and...

509
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,630
不  我喜歡  但這樣我會錯過我的舞蹈課
No, I enjoy it, but I'm missing dance class for this.

510
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,550
有時候我比起去打獵還是喜歡去上課
And sometimes I would rather do that than hunting.

511
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,900
舞蹈課對你來說這麼重要嗎
I mean, is-is-is dance class that important to you?

512
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,470
-是的  -你需要在樹林裡多花點時間
- Yeah, it is. - You need some more time

513
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,270
-打獵和釣魚  -不
- in the woods to go hunting and fishing. - No.

514
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,610
我週末會和你一起去  爸爸
On weekends, I'll do it with you, Dad.

515
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,370
我真的很喜歡和你一起
Like, I really love spending time with you,

516
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
但我現在很喜歡跳舞  而且
but right now dancing is my thing, you know, and...

517
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,210
我真心愛上了這門課  我是說...
it really hits me in the heart. I mean, I...

518
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,650
爸爸  小心
Dad, look out!

519
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,620
你是怎麼回事  小子
What the hell happened to you, Hoss?

520
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,720
上帝啊
Oh, shit.

521
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
爸爸  你看
Dad, look.

522
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,360
小塊頭  你留在這裡
Lumpy, you stay here.

523
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,830
我去看看有沒有人受傷
I'm gonna make sure no one's hurt.

524
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,660
-你報警  -好的
- You call the police. - Okay.

525
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,800
爸爸  小心點
Dad, be careful, please.

526
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,400
你們沒事吧
Hey, you fellas okay?

527
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,280
你沒事吧
You all right?

528
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,350
警察  有什麼緊急情況
911. What is the emergency?

529
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,690
發生了一起意外
Yes. Um, th-there's been an accident.

530
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,690
有一輛公交車
Uh, there's a bus.

531
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,430
人們都在路上亂跑
People running around in the road.

532
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,730
我爸爸下去看了  我不知道
My dad went to look. I-I don't know.

533
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,270
好吧  等等
Okay. Hold on.

534
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,830
我去看看
I'll go check.

535
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
爸爸
Dad?

536
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,230
快跑
Run.

537
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,140
在這裡等著
Wait here.

538
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,670
我去叫我爸爸
I-I'll go get my dad.

539
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,770

Don't shoot. Aah!

544
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,600
-操  -操
- Oh, fuck! - Fuck!

545
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,370
"不需要信用卡就能乘這火車"[《愛的力量》歌詞]
"Don't need a credit card to ride this train."

546
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,840
霍克  聽著  這個球只要掉了  就說明
Yo, Hawk, listen, the ball come down loose, that's where

957
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,290
進屋
Get inside!

958
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,880
操
Fuck!

959
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,600
邁克爾
Michael!

960
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,850
見鬼
Oh, shit.

961
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,270
勞瑞  操
Laurie. Fuck!

962
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,280
天啊  弗蘭克
Jesus Christ, Frank!

963
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,810
-我操  -搞什麼鬼
- Fuck me! - What the fuck?

964
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,550
你在這裡幹什麼
What the hell are you doing here?

965
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,850
弗蘭克  他在這裡
Frank, he's here.

966
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,450
我知道
I know.

967
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:36,030
這邊請
This way, please.

968
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:47,810
看誰來了
Look who's up.

969
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,580
他在哪裡
Where is he?

970
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,620
你說呢
You tell me.

971
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,460
邁克爾干倒第一個警衛和司機後  汽車失控
The bus lost control after Michael overtook the first guard and the driver.

972
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,060
他甦醒了
He's no longer dormant.

973
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,000
他只知道如何保持移動
He only knows how to keep moving

974
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,600
一直殺人
and to keep killing.

975
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,870
不抓住他的話  他會再開殺戒
And he will kill again unless he's captured.

976
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,740
跟我來一下
Come with me for a minute.

977
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,310
你老實待著
You sit still.

978
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,480
我這不是很老實嗎
Well, I was sitting still anyway.

979
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,780
-什麼意思  -他有用處
- What do you mean? - He's an asset.

980
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,710
他沒用  他就是個累贅
He's not an asset. He's a liability.

981
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,520
不  他在獵殺
No, no. He's on this hunt.

982
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,850
沒人比他更瞭解邁爾斯
Nobody knows Myers better than he does.

983
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,490
-謝謝  -你要我
- Oh, thank you. - You want me to take

984
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,020
帶上這個受傷的平民  去緝拿
this injured civilian to go look for

985
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,490
-一個變態連環殺手嗎  -警長
- a psychopathic serial killer? - Sheriff.

986
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,890
弗蘭克  這是在幹什麼
Frank. Wha-What are we doing?

987
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:34,960
我們現在不需要你的幫助  勞瑞
We don't need your help right now, Laurie.

988
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,330
你們就在這裡乾站著  拜託你們做點什麼
You're just standing here! Please do something!

989
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:39,530
借過  警官們
Excuse me, officers.

990
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,700
勞瑞·斯卓德
Laurie Strode.

991
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,880
勞瑞·斯卓德  這位是薩頓醫生
Laurie Strode, meet Dr. Sartain.

992
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,910
我是邁克爾的醫生
I'm Michael's doctor.

993
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,510
蘭比爾·薩頓
Ranbir Sartain.

994
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,680
你是那個新醫生
Oh, you're the new Loomis.

995
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,820
我看過你和邁克爾的一切
I read everything about you and Michael.

996
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,990
一切
Everything.

997
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,590
這位朋友霍金斯
Did you know our friend Hawkins here

998
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,990
是1978年邁克爾被抓時
was the first responding deputy

999
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,000
首先響應的警員  你知道嗎
when Michael was apprehended in 1978?

1000
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,870
那晚是他阻止了盧米斯殺死邁克爾
He stopped Loomis from killing Michael that night.

1001
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:23,480
你知道嗎  我每晚都祈禱他逃出來
Do you know that I pray every night that he would escape?

1002
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,010
你為什麼那樣
What the hell do you do that for?

1003
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,520
這樣我才能殺他
So I can kill him.

1004
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,550
你真的不該祈禱那樣
Well, that was a dumb thing to pray for.

1005
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,980
他肯定會道歉的  他睡一覺就好了
I'm sure he'll apologize. He just needs to sleep it off.

1006
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,900
卡梅倫不想讓任何人把他當壞人
Cameron doesn't want anyone to see him as a bad guy,

1007
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,000
但後來他喝醉酒想惹事
but then he gets drunk and gets belligerent

1008
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,740
就跟個白癡一樣
and looks like an idiot.

1009
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:52,510
後來因為護著他  我又跟個白癡一樣
And then I look like an idiot for vouching for him.

1010
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:57,680
我真的受夠了大家一直讓我失望
I'm really tired of everybody letting me down all the time.

1011
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,120
你應該得到更好的
You deserve better.

1012
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,950
我是說
I mean...

1013
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,850
艾莉森  你是學校裡最酷  最漂亮
Allyson, you're the coolest, you're the prettiest,

1014
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,210
最好心的女生
and you're the nicest girl in school.

1015
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:09,520
如果有誰不欣賞你
And if anyone doesn't appreciate that,

1016
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,990
那肯定是瘋了
they're a crazy person.

1017
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,430
謝謝
Thank you.

1018
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,570
你真是個好人
That's very sweet.

1019
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,440
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

1020
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,470
我知道一條近路
I know a shortcut.

1021
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,020
從醫學角度來講
From a clinical perspective,

1022
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,480
醫生  你覺得勞瑞·斯卓德
Doctor, would you say that Laurie Strode

1023
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,010
是瘋了嗎
has lost her fucking marbles?

1024
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,180
悲劇和暴力可以從很多方面
There are many ways for tragedy and violence

1025
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,980
改變一個受害者
to change a victim.

1026
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,580
他們有可能習慣於總是擔心
They can grow accustomed to always being afraid,

1027
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,750
總是處於恐懼中
in constant fear.

1028
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,820
他們可能變弱  可能變強
They can grow weak, they can grow strong.

1029
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,990
但是還有另一面
But there's also the other side.

1030
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,490
什麼另一面
What other side is that?

1031
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,800
對施害者的影響
The effect on the victimizer.

1032
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,730
其實這就是我的研究中
You see, this is what has intrigued me

1033
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,740
讓我感興趣的地方
through my studies.

1034
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:54,770
邁克爾的罪行對他自己有何影響
How does a crime like Michael's affect him?

1035
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,710
那是什麼感覺
Hmm? What's that feeling?

1036
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:02,640
他是隨機如此  還是有情感動機
Is he on a random path, or is he emotionally driven?

1037
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,690
是什麼觸發的嗎
Triggered by something?

1038
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:08,890
或許是他內心的一種聽不見的聲音
Perhaps some unheard marching order imprinted on his very being.

1039
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,020
我想知道他的感受是什麼
I want to know what he's feeling.

1040
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,620
我想知道他從殺戮中得到什麼快感
I want to know what pleasure he gets out of killing.

1041
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,860
這個殺手在哪裡  我們得找到他
Where is this killer? We gotta find him.

1042
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,660
這次我不會阻礙正義了
I'm not gonna stand in the way of justice this time.

1043
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,670
記住  他是國家財產
Remember, he's property of the state.

1044
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,270
-不能傷害到他  -是嗎
- He mustn't be harmed. - Oh, yeah?

1045
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,670
再說吧
We'll see about that.

1046
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,710
這裡不安全
It's not safe here.

1047
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,270
艾莉森呢
Where's Allyson?

1048
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,710
她在哪裡
Where is she?

1049
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,240
艾莉森在哪裡
Where's Allyson?!

1050
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,080
親愛的  是媽媽  聽到留言後
Honey, it's Mom. Can you please call me back

1051
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,710
能馬上給我回電話嗎
the second that you get this, please?

1052
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,880
警察說舞會現場已經疏散了
The police said that they evacuated the dance,

1053
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,980
我又聯繫不到你
and I can't get in touch with you.

1054
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,720
他們要讓我們去你外婆家
And they're making us go to your grandmother's house

1055
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,990
因為那樣安全...
because it's safe...

1056
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,990
親愛的  我是你外婆
Sweetheart, this is your grandmother.

1057
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,290
你家裡有一位警員等著
There is a police officer waiting at your house

1058
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,990
帶你找我們
to bring you to us.

1059
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,860
我們會都在一起的
We're all gonna be together.

1060
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,960
你按我說的做
Now, do as I say.

1061
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,030
見鬼
Oh, shit.

1062
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:26,600
這裡很危險
It's treacherous as hell here.

1063
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,870
-好  -你能行吧
- Okay. - You good?

1064
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,270
-扶住我的手  -好
- Take my hand. - Okay.

1065
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,680
-來  -就沒見過這麼傻逼的近路
- Right here. - This is the dumbest shortcut ever.

1066
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,110
小心那些毒籐
Watch out for all the poison ivy.

1067
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,940
-別讓我摔到上面  -好  我扶著你
- Don't let me fall on that. - All right. I got you.

1068
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,710
-我扶著你  來吧  -好  跳
- I got you. Okay, I got you. - Okay, go.

1069
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,280
好了
Okay.

1070
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,280
你做到了
You did it. Yay.

1071
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,050
好樣的
Good job.

1072
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,650
你幹什麼
What are you doing?

1073
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:45,750
你應該得到更好的
I mean, you deserve better.

1074
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,750
-是吧  我是說...  -不
- Right? I mean... - No...

1075
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,860
搞什麼
What the fuck?

1076
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,030
我...怎麼  你又不跟卡梅倫在一起了
I-I... What? You're not with Cameron anymore.

1077
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,030
那不...
That does not...

1078
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,900
那不意味著我想跟你在一起
That does not mean I want to be with you.

1079
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,970
我以為...我以為你在給我信號
I thought... I thought you were sending me signals.

1080
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,670
-絕對沒有  -真的很抱歉
- Definitely no signals. - I'm so sorry.

1081
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,100
拜託  你不能把這個告訴卡梅倫
Please, you cannot tell Cameron about this.

1082
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,000
我也沒感覺  我發誓
I-I didn't feel anything, either. I swear.

1083
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:05,040
-我不...等等  我不...  -你真可悲
- I didn't... Wait, I didn't... - You are so pathetic.

1084
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,780
我要回家了 你自己的事自己想去吧
I'm going home. You can figure your own shit out.

1085
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,680
是誰  什麼...喂
Sh... Who's there? Wha-What... Hey!

1086
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,820
運動傳感器  傻子
Motion sensor, dumb-ass!

1087
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:18,290
艾莉森  我現在真的很醉  真的
Allyson, I'm, like, really drunk right now. Seriously.

1088
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,850
我在派對上變得很飢渴
I got really horny at the party, and, like,

1089
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,390
女孩子都對著我跳舞
all these girls were, like, dancing on me.

1090
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,360
她們美好的肉體讓我硬了  艾莉森
Their beautiful bodies got me all chubbed out, Allyson.

1091
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,960
我...艾莉森  拜託
I... Allyson, please!

1092
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,080
她們...她們那麼性感地
They, like... they were feeding me guacamole

1093
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,460
給我吃鱷梨醬
in all these sexy ways.

1094
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,010
那不是我的...
It's not my...

1095
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:48,100
萬聖節快樂  艾洛德先生  我...
Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod. I'm-I'm just...

1096
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:48,780
我不知道  抱歉
I don't know, man. I'm sorry.

1097
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,150
我不是故意擅闖你的院子  該死
I'm not trying to trespass on your yard and shit, man.

1098
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,690
我只想跟一個很漂亮的女孩子
I was just trying to take a shortcut

1099
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,220
抄個近路  我只是...
with a really pretty girl, and I just...

1100
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,090
我真的很喜歡她
I just really like her, man,

1101
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,200
我以為她也喜歡我
and I-I thought that she liked me, too.

1102
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,760
我只是...
And I just... it just...

1103
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,400
你有沒有真的喜歡一個女孩
Have you ever really liked a girl

1104
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,200
但是卻得不到她
and you just couldn't have her?

1105
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,070
我...很抱歉
I'm s... I'm sorry, man.

1106
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,170
我...我就不煩你了
I'll just... I'll peace out of your hair, man.

1107
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:12,840
謝謝你...
Thank-thank you for...

1108
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,850
你去哪裡了  你這樣...
Where'd you go, man? You're acting...

1109
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,750
夥計  你這樣
Dude, you're acting, like,

1110
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,860
真的很嚇人  我不...
really sketchy right now. I don't...

1111
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,330
怎麼
What's up?

1112
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,340
我馬上走...我不...
I'm-I'm-I'm leaving right... I don't...

1113
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,870
我...

1136
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,740
-我女兒沒打電話來  -安全起見  你還是...
- 'Cause my daughter is not calling. - It's safer for you...

1137
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,540
-她沒發信息  -凱倫  快進去吧
- She's not texting. - Come on, Karen, let's go inside.

1138
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,800
大家都在找你女兒
Everyone's looking for your daughter.

1139
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,280
-交給他們處理  -不管你們
- Let them take care of it. - So whoever you had

1140
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,410
讓誰去找她  顯然他們無法認出她
looking for her is obviously not able to identify her.

1141
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,650
-我們會找到你女兒的  -今天是萬聖節
- We're gonna find your daughter. - It's Halloween.

1142
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:27,450

1143
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,450
-凱倫  行了  -根本不可能
- Karen, come on. - There is no way.

1144
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,190
-凱倫  凱倫  -她變裝了  知道嗎
- Karen. Karen. - She had a costume, you know?

1145
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,250
-我們得進屋  -有時間的人手都...
- We need to go in the house. - We have everybody available...

1146
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,990
都過了40年了好嗎
In the last 40 years, okay?

1147
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,600
親愛的  讓他們去做他們的工作  他們...
Honey, if you let 'em do their job, they're gonna...

1148
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,390
凱倫
Karen!

1149
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,100
深呼吸  如果你想  我們可以打...
Just breathe. And if you want, we can call...

1150
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,340
待在車裡  醫生
Stay in the car, Doctor.

1151
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,140
-你沒事吧  -深呼吸  親愛的
- You all right? - Take deep breaths, sweetheart.

1152
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:56,410
-他...他就在街上  -好
- He's... he's down the street. - Okay.

1153
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,610
-好  -他回來了  他殺了我朋友
- Okay. - He's back. He killed my friend.

1154
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,150
不會有事的  好了
Everything's gonna be all right. It's okay.

1155
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,520
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

1156
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,890
我們會帶你去找你媽媽  好嗎
We're gonna take you back to your mom, okay?

1157
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,860
我是醫生  把門關好
I'm a doctor. Lock your doors.

1158
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,360
大家都回家  把門關好
Everybody, get back to your houses now and lock your doors.

1159
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,160
我們帶你去找你媽媽
We're gonna take you to your mom.

1160
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,560
不用擔心他  不用擔心他
Don't worry about him. Don't worry about him.

1161
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:16,060
馬上回家
Back in your houses now!

1162
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,180
你們聽到警察說的了
You heard the officer.

1163
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,000
-怎麼回事  -回家
- What is going on? - Back in your houses!

1164
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,940
把門關上
Lock your goddamn doors.

1165
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,190
這是什麼
What's this?

1166
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,200
這是我的童年
It's my childhood.

1167
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,240
下去吧
Let's go.

1168
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,630
好了  自己來挑傢伙吧
All right, pick your poison.

1169
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,510
我喜歡左輪手槍  從不會卡殼
I like a revolver. They never jam.

1170
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,310
這高精準度和強阻止能力
This is accuracy and stopping power.

1171
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,650
這是戰術
This is tactical.

1172
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,120
他等今晚等了很久了
He waited for this night.

1173
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,120
他在等我
He's waited for me.

1174
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,520
我也在等他
I've waited for him.

1175
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,630
放馬過來吧  邁克爾
Come on, Michael.

1176
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,500
艾莉森  睜大眼睛
Allyson, keep your eyes open.

1177
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,450
-他就在附近  -601
- He is out there somewhere. - 601.

1178
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,540
11街發現嫌疑人  在聖人公園附近
Suspect reported on 11th, near Saint Park.

1179
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,610
收到  調度中心
Copy that, Dispatch.

1180
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,550
我就在這裡
I got eyes.

1181
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,420
看  是他
Look! It's him!

1182
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,290
找到了
Here we go.

1183
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,560
都坐穩
Brace yourselves.

1184
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,030
別撞他
Don't hit him!

1185
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:22,630
-小心  -邁克爾
- Watch out! - Michael!

1186
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,240
別開槍
Don't shoot him.

1187
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,210
-醫生  回車上  -不
- Doctor, get back in the car. - No!

1188
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,040
你殺了他  他死了
You killed him. He's dead.

1189
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,510
-退後  -不
- Stand back. - No.

1190
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,650
我還是要一槍把這個混蛋的腦袋打開花
I'm still gonna blow this motherfucker's brains out.

1191
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,320
走開  別碰我的病人
Get away. Leave my patient alone.

1192
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,450
離屍體遠點  退後
Get away from the body. Stand back.

1193
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:47,160
我再說最後一遍  離嫌疑人遠點
I'm not gonna say it again. Step away from the suspect.

1194
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,660
離...
Step a...

1195
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:58,470
操
Fuck.

1196
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,080
救命  救命
Help! Help!

1197
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,310
救命
Help!

1198
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:26,830
原來就是這種感覺
So this is what it feels like.

1199
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,370
救命
Help!

1200
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:18,150
-給我的病人讓點地方出來  -不
- Make room for my patient. - No!

1201
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,190
不
No.

1202
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,660
不
No!

1203
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,570
那些人想因為你看到的罪行
These people want to kill this man

1204
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,370
殺這個人
for the crimes you observed.

1205
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,240
這是理解惡人思想
The most important opportunity

1206
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,480
最重要的機會
to understand the mind of evil, you see.

1207
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,210
等他醒了  我們會做好準備
So, when he awakes, we'll be ready.

1208
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,720
什麼準備
Ready for what?

1209
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,580
重聚
The reunion.

1210
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:55,450
邁克爾對勞瑞·斯卓德的追逐
Michael's pursuit of Laurie Strode

1211
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:57,860
有可能是讓他活下來的動力
could be what keeps him alive.

1212
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:02,490
我懷疑是成為捕食者的概念
I would suspect the notion of being a predator

1213
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:07,900
或者成為獵物的恐懼  讓他們二人得以活下來
or the fear of becoming prey keeps both of them alive.

1214
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,270
你想吃越南三明治嗎
You want a banh mi sandwich?

1215
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,510
什麼  那是什麼
A what? What is that?

1216
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:15,770
-越南三明治  -那是...
- A banh mi sandwich. - What's a...

1217
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,680
那是什麼  我根本不知道那是什麼
Wh-What is that? I don't even know what that is.

1218
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,990
我就喜歡你這一點  弗朗西斯  你真循規蹈矩
I love that about you, Francis. You're so predictable.

1219
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:21,880
你每天都按部就班
You're like a PB and J every day kind of guy.

1220
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,250
又來了
Oh, here we go.

1221
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,380
越南三明治
No, a banh mi sandwich.

1222
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,720
外面本質上就是
Banh mi is essentially just

1223
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,690
越南版的法國長棍麵包
the Vietnamese version of a French baguette.

1224
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,540
-嗯  -這個詞事實上指的是
- Mm-hmm. - And the term actually refers

1225
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,590
外面的麵包  而不是中間夾的東西
to the bread and not so much the contents therein.

1226
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,300
-嗯  -但你的搭檔
- Mm. - But your partner,

1227
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,760
