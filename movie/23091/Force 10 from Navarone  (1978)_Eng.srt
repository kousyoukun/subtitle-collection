1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,040
Deep in the heart of the Aegean
lies the island of Navarone.

2
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,025
In 1943, it stood lik e a thorn
in the Allied side.

3
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,280
Newly designed radar-controlled guns
set in the heart of the ancient rock...

4
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:36,700
gave the German High Command
total strategic dominance.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,700
Air strik es and naval attacks
had proven costly and ineffective.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,870
In desperation, the Allies turned
to infiltration.

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,130
On the night of September the 24th, a
specially trained commando group...

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,135
succeeded in penetrating
the very heart of the gun complex...

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,055
planted explosives at the base
of the giant shell hoists...

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,970
then withdrew to await rescue
by ships of the Royal Navy.

11
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,937
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 reps.

12
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:26,912
Fire!

13
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:13,597
Move! Move!

14
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:15,265
Come on, move it!

15
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,348
Move it!

16
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,390
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

17
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,479
Regulations state, sir, that in the
absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...

18
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:28,740
the acting catering officer,
that's you, sir...

19
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,491
shall authorize once per week,
the issue of offal.

20
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:34,073
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...

21
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,916
is kidneys, liver,
tongue, brains...

22
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,040
Well, I'll be damned!

23
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,498
- Milly, how nice to see you!
- Hello, sir.

24
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,243
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.

25
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:46,249
I'm reporting to Cmdr. Jensen.

26
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:50,373
I gather you've been hurling yourself
over the white cliffs. How's the leg?

27
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:54,052
It's in the same place. I thought
they pensioned you off for good.

28
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:56,548
You still peddling
those whiz-bangs of yours?

29
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:59,512
Yes, we've got things that go boom
for all occasions.

30
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:02,603
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting...

31
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,441
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Cmdr. Jensen waiting.

32
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:09,770
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, together.

33
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,237
Corporal, put that in my office,
will you?

34
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,198
Mallory.

35
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,123
Take a pew. How's the leg?

36
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,283
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,950
Hear you've been attached
to Winston's toy shop.

38
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,295
"Department of Dirty Tricks"
as the Whitehall chaps call it.

39
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,623
Well, they speak very well of you.

40
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,711
Right. We need you chaps
for something rather special.

41
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:47,642
I'm afraid it's not exactly
a masterpiece...

42
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,978
but I wonder if you can identify
this fellow.

43
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,811
Think back to Navarone.

44
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,975
I'd rather not, sir.

45
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,732
Nicolai?

46
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,149
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?

47
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:08,822
But what about him?

48
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:11,913
Andrea's people had him shot
as a traitor, didn't they?

49
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,659
Yes, so we were told.

50
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,113
In fact, he escaped.

51
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,830
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...

52
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,835
who we believe is operating now
in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...

53
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,332
posing as one Capt. Lescovar.

54
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,468
Now, you both knew Nicolai.

55
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:31,262
In fact, you're the only people we know
of can make a positive identification.

56
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,183
So I'd like you to go out there
and cope.

57
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:36,592
Cope, sir?

58
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:38,514
Kill him.

59
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:40,976
Discreetly, if possible.

60
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:43,603
But I'm a civilian now, sir.

61
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,186
Yes, we thought about that.

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,065
So you've been recalled
to the current and promoted.

63
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,780
Staff sergeant.

64
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,358
Awfully generous, sir.

65
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,655
Exactly how do we get there?

66
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:55,783
We're tacking you onto Force 10.

67
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:59,535
The code name for an operation
for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.

68
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:02,790
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?

69
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,532
It's being treated
on a need-to-know basis.

70
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:07,066
And you don't need to know.

71
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,252
And you don't need to know.

72
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,788
Barnsby, come in.

73
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,211
- Sir?
- Colonel.

74
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,390
Force 10 flies out tonight.

75
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,514
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.

76
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,140
I beg your pardon, sir?

77
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,230
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.

78
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,068
Just a sideshow.
This is Maj. Mallory, Sgt. Miller.

79
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,061
Lt. Col. Barnsby.

80
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:40,234
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been
planned down to the last detail.

81
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,990
The last thing we need are
a couple of passengers.

82
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,245
Maj. Mallory does have a certain
amount of experience.

83
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:48,742
I wouldn't doubt it.

84
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,584
We're talking about
some hard travelling, sir.

85
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:55,202
We've gotta move fast. My men
are young, in top physical shape.

86
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,502
- They're specially trained for this.
- I'm aware of that.

87
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,423
Sir, I am concerned about the safety
of my command.

88
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:06,167
Well, these chaps have got
a job to do as well.

89
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:09,431
And it's up to you to deliver them
safely to the Partisans.

90
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,924
And you leave for Italy
at 2300 hours...

91
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:15,019
and you take off for Yugoslavia
the following night.

92
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,145
Very well, sir.

93
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:20,019
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.

94
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:26,187
Well, we'll do our best not to make
a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.

95
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,708
All right, enough!

96
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:04,475
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...

97
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:10,270
we might be going to Yugoslavia
by walking on water.

98
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:19,739
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.

99
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,739
Stop it.

100
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:27,247
Nolan, kill the lights.
All right, out.

101
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,492
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.

102
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,930
You're gonna miss your plane
unless you join us now, major.

103
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,107
Remarkable way of getting
on an aircraft, don't you think so?

104
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,352
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?

105
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,277
It's not easy if you insist on climbing
through fences in the dark...

106
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:08,362
when there's a perfectly good gate
half a mile up the road.

107
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,660
Anything we can do to help?

108
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:13,664
Yeah, you can keep quiet
and out of the way, major.

109
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,704
I don't have a lot of time
for explanations.

110
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,624
One thing that you don't know...

111
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,670
is the last three Allied missions
into Yugoslavia...

112
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,967
were blown right here in Italy.

113
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:37,011
So this time when we fly out, we're
not advertising the fact to anybody.

114
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,989
Holy cow, will you look
at those guys!

115
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,242
They're stealing half the field.

116
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:07,078
All right, hold it.

117
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,711
Wait for me.

118
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:13,175
Okay, men, let's go!

119
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:17,676
- Blake, take care of Rastus there.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,921
Okay, fellas, freeze.

121
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,591
Back off. Come on, get back.

122
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,722
And you, back, back!

123
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,427
Bill, Eddie, fetch those other guys
out of there.

124
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:04,962
What's your name, kid?

125
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,796
Walter.

126
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:13,720
What's yours?

127
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:16,563
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.

128
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,724
Walter.

129
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,150
Good evening.

130
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,493
Major, move!

131
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:47,121
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.

132
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,420
We're very much obliged to you,
sergeant.

133
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:51,500
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sgt. Weaver. Thank you.

134
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:53,669
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

135
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,921
- But, sir!
- All set, colonel.

136
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:58,006
- Still stuff outside?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:02,139
- Okay, Oberstein?
- Fine.

138
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:08,682
Hey, sir!

139
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:11,770
Where's Nolan?

140
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:15,110
I think you can take it
he won't be joining us.

141
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:19,110
Okay, let's go.

142
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:27,706
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...

143
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,203
and you run out on me.

144
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,368
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.

145
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,663
Hey, man, don't push!
Don't push me!

146
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,954
- Look, you!
- I think it's a bit late for that now.

147
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,488
Look, you just shouldn't have
left me there. I saved you bums.

148
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:15,580
Well, we didn't think you'd like
where we're going.

149
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:17,872
You let me worry about that, huh?

150
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,826
That guy's gonna melt
into the landscape.

151
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:24,870
Yeah, them Partisans are gonna think
they've been invaded by Zulus.

152
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,750
Well, you are one man short.

153
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:31,259
Well, Nolan can handle a chute,
at least.

154
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:36,430
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.

155
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,435
That's right, you learn
on the way down.

156
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,687
I'd better go tell the colonel
we got us another passenger.

157
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:48,269
I think the colonel's got enough on
his plate for the moment, don't you?

158
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:10,204
So sorry.

159
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:15,039
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.

160
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:17,755
You never know.
It might come in useful.

161
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:26,310
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?

162
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:27,972
My pyjamas.

163
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,635
Looks like high-explosive pyjamas
to me.

164
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:32,094
Not to worry, old boy.

165
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:36,816
Been handling this since I blew up
the nursery with my first chemistry set.

166
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,275
Poor old nanny.

167
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,833
We got company.

168
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,001
Cut two!

169
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,639
Reynolds, bail out!

170
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:08,892
Jump!

171
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:10,524
Go!

172
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:13,063
Come on, move it!

173
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,903
Come on, get out!

174
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:18,899
Come on, move!

175
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,952
Come on!

176
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,413
Mallory.

177
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:16,083
Okay.

178
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:19,923
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down!

179
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:31,763
Come on.

180
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:10,296
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.

181
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:12,879
Where's your Sgt. Miller?

182
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:55,228
How the hell did he get here?

183
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,061
You let him on the plane?

184
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:02,150
I think he more or less
invited himself.

185
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:18,281
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.

186
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,867
You don't call him man.
You call him sir, and you call me sir.

187
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:27,089
And as long as you're here, you do
as you're told. Understood, soldier?

188
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:36,004
Yes, sir.

189
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,349
We've gotta get out of here
before that patrol comes back.

190
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,472
Lt. Reynolds, take point.
Sgt. Weaver, bring up the rear.

191
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,849
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.

192
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,315
Organized young gentleman,
isn't he?

193
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:29,469
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.

194
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:32,763
If we keep going east, we'll
end up where we're supposed to.

195
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:35,476
How did we get stuck
with those two clowns?

196
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,728
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.

197
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:43,069
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.

198
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:46,405
Do you think that young man has
any idea where we are, Milly?

199
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:50,323
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.

200
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,413
I'll go and try and find out.

201
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:56,250
Yes, why don't you do that.

202
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:59,993
Excuse me, colonel.

203
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,413
Do you have any idea
where we are?

204
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:04,415
I've got a good idea where we are.

205
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:08,255
And how long it's gonna take to get
there, if you two can't keep up.

206
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,924
All right, let's move it.

207
00:24:26,985 --> 00:24:30,685
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvellous.

208
00:24:30,863 --> 00:24:33,615
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.

209
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,035
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.

210
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:38,614
Yes.

211
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:42,700
I've often thought that I'd rather like
to settle down there some day.

212
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:46,036
Looks like you're gonna have
to change your plans.

213
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,715
Take it easy.

214
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,972
Welcome.

215
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,390
Capt. Drazak.

216
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:17,105
Seventeenth Partisan Regiment.

217
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:19,899
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!

218
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:22,645
Thank you, Capt. Drazak.

219
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:25,482
They frightened you with bandages,
huh?

220
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,985
Without bandages you...

221
00:25:29,164 --> 00:25:31,998
German, how you say:

222
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,957
You say, "flamethrower."

223
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,498
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.

224
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,088
Hello! Hello!

225
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:41,082
How do you do?

226
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:46,507
This is Maritza,
good soldier comrade.

227
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:49,928
How do you do,
good soldier comrade?

228
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,759
Hello, blackie.

229
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,117
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.

230
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:30,375
Back off, soldier.

231
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,884
I make big joke...

232
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,730
but joke on me.

233
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:00,653
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.

234
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:04,241
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.

235
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:05,741
Come.

236
00:27:05,914 --> 00:27:08,321
Come, we go.

237
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:18,663
Where did you learn to punch
like that? Harvard?

238
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:21,759
No, Harlem. Colonel?

239
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,178
I'm not trying to get anybody
killed, least of all me.

240
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:29,676
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.

241
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,447
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.

242
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:49,446
Good, good. Well, it looks like
things may work out after all, huh?

243
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:53,283
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still
carry out our little sideshow.

244
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:55,281
Sorry about Force 10.

245
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:57,947
You're down to two men, aren't you?

246
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,616
Of course, I don't know
what your mission was...

247
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:05,290
but obviously it just isn't
on now, is it, colonel?

248
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,912
Looks rather like your own youngster,
doesn't he?

249
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:44,824
Do you really think so?

250
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,001
Please, come.

251
00:28:58,177 --> 00:29:00,668
Come, eat.

252
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,600
We are Chetniks...

253
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:18,017
not stinking Partisans.

254
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:30,533
We hunt Allied commandos
like wild pigs!

255
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:33,374
We work with Germans.
They are our friends!

256
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:43,042
Good evening, gentlemen.

257
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,623
Maj. Schroeder, 11 th army corps.

258
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:48,339
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.

259
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,552
We thought these people were
Partisans.

260
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:53,640
- Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
- Sure.

261
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,893
Chetniks? Who would have
believed that?

262
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,394
The other three Allied missions
that fell into our hands...

263
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:03,899
were not quite so happy about it
as you appear to be.

264
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,977
I'm not surprised, sir.

265
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:10,316
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.

266
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,318
Deserters?

267
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:17,110
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.

268
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:21,529
You see, we were
in a prison camp in Termoli.

269
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:22,739
We escaped.

270
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,036
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.

271
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:31,087
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and
landed in your territory, thank God.

272
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,585
Fascinating.

273
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:38,668
Tell me, why exactly
did you desert?

274
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:41,006
Now, I'm glad you asked that.

275
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,010
Yes.

276
00:30:43,185 --> 00:30:46,849
Well, I am afraid
that is rather a long story.

277
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:51,018
Oh, please, you must not
be afraid of boring me.

278
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,273
Have you ever heard of penicillin?

279
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:56,774
No.

280
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:00,737
Well, I'm not surprised.
It's new.

281
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:03,825
It's a drug that prevents wounds
from becoming infected.

282
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,616
It cures a whole range of infections...

283
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,789
including some of the nastier
social diseases.

284
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:14,204
It's become one of the most
sought-after items on the black market.

285
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:17,794
Our friend here, Sgt. Weaver
of the American Medical Corps...

286
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:20,372
was our supplier.

287
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:28,381
You are saying you stole these drugs
from the Army to sell to civilians?

288
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:34,468
Not just to civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.

289
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:35,844
Any army.

290
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:38,517
I see.

291
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,940
Tell me, what has all this to do
with that suitcase you keep looking at?

292
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,817
Well, that suitcase
is full of our penicillin.

293
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,153
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?

294
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,986
Certainly, major.

295
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,739
Open it, Miller.

296
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,947
You can't do that here,
you'd ruin the lot.

297
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,458
You know perfectly well that
any contamination will destroy it.

298
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,834
It must be opened
under laboratory conditions.

299
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:07,959
There's nearly half a million
pounds worth of stuff here.

300
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:11,584
I know all that, but the major
is not interested in our penicillin.

301
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,634
He only wants to know the truth.

302
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:17,138
What's the use of a half a million
pounds to you out here?

303
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:22,847
Yes, well, that's beside the point,
sir, but I'm not going to open it.

304
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,724
Our story doesn't seem
to convince you.

305
00:32:29,902 --> 00:32:31,977
No, it does not.

306
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:35,154
That's up to you, but every word
he's told you is true.

307
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:38,442
If you don't believe it,
check with your intelligence.

308
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:40,491
They'll verify the entire story.

309
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:44,361
Oh, I shall certainly verify
your story.

310
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,247
Every word of it.

311
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,910
Get in!

312
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:02,763
Cute story, major, very cute.

313
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,134
Now, what happens
when they open the suitcase?

314
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:10,008
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?

315
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:16,849
Headquarters acknowledges
your signal.

316
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:18,852
Thank you, Bauer.

317
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:45,080
Maritza...

318
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:48,758
what do you think?

319
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,052
They're lying.

320
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:53,547
What does it matter, anyway?

321
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:55,846
Kill them.

322
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,718
Yeah, you are probably right.

323
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:04,224
Do you know what I was thinking?

324
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,807
After the war, $1 million.

325
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:10,319
You, a simple peasant girl
from where?

326
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:13,857
I can never pronounce the name
of the place you come from.

327
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,251
With so much money, we could...

328
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:27,829
They're lying.

329
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,830
Kill them.

330
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,515
Out! Get out.

331
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,466
What did I tell you?

332
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,641
Well, at least we got
a good night's sleep.

333
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,109
Good morning, gentlemen.

334
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:52,570
Our intelligence confirms
your escape from Italy.

335
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:56,323
You and you, follow me, please.

336
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,717
Your escape from Italy
is one thing.

337
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:15,924
The rest of your story
is something else.

338
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:19,549
I had time to sleep on it.

339
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:23,176
So this morning,
you know what I did?

340
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:27,348
I opened the suitcase.

341
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:30,014
Maritza!

342
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:38,356
And what do you think I found?

343
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:43,529
Firewood.

344
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,371
What did you expect? We buried it
before your Chetniks picked us up.

345
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:53,876
We're not stupid. It's the only thing
we've got to bargain with.

346
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,878
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.

347
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,465
You know they're lying. Why don't
you let Drazak get rid of them?

348
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,344
Gently, Maritza.

349
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:07,095
I don't believe your so-called penicillin
exists, but it just might.

350
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,053
So I will let you go
and dig it up for me.

351
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:15,888
And if we do, you'll shoot us
and bury us in the same hole.

352
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,603
I shall certainly shoot you
if you don't.

353
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:23,560
Well, gentlemen,
the choice is yours.

354
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:57,306
What I can't figure is how
the firewood got in the case.

355
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:59,468
Neither can I.

356
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:03,973
Don't know where we're going to find
any spare penicillin here, do you?

357
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:07,766
What are we going to do, keep
walking until we reach the Adriatic?

358
00:38:07,943 --> 00:38:10,814
I don't think the iron maiden
will let us get that far.

359
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,612
Halt!

360
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,027
What did I tell you?

361
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:20,404
We are three miles past the spot
where you were picked up.

362
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,746
Well, where is this
wonderful treasure?

363
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,204
In your imagination?

364
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:28,783
No, ma'am,
it's not in our imagination.

365
00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:31,286
I think it's a bit further on,
don't you?

366
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:34,749
Yes, it is. Well, I mean,
it's not much further than this.

367
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:37,463
It's hard to tell,
the whole country looks alike.

368
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:40,173
You will start digging
within five minutes.

369
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:44,345
What if we haven't found it
in five minutes?

370
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:47,637
Then you will be digging
your graves.

371
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,872
Hey, colonel.

372
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,034
Wait a minute,
now this looks familiar.

373
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:19,045
Isn't this our little hollow
down here?

374
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:22,130
Yes, I think it is.

375
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:26,875
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.

376
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:28,761
I think this is it.

377
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,590
- This knoll over here?
- Right.

378
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:34,347
You see, comrade, we lined it up
between them...

379
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:39,094
There you are!
There's our pile of stones.

380
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,114
Gotta get them closer
and we use the spades.

381
00:39:53,118 --> 00:39:55,655
You take the two
that are closest to you...

382
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:58,912
and I'll take the other one
and the broad.

383
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:16,842
I'm gonna get them
closer now, okay?

384
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:26,219
Fritz. Fritz, come!
It's here.

385
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,067
- Ready?
- All right.

386
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:42,118
You can get up now.
They're dead.

387
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:54,415
I put firewood in people's cases
and hide their high explosives.

388
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:56,081
Don't sit there gawping.

389
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:59,540
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.

390
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:02,801
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.

391
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:04,796
Now, go.

392
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:07,343
Excuse me,
good comrade soldier...

393
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:11,761
but exactly what story are you
gonna tell Schroeder about all this?

394
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:14,803
You took us by surprise.

395
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,889
You got away.

396
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:19,643
Here, hit me.

397
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:24,356
Did you expect me to go back there
with my hair combed?

398
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,561
Hit me!

399
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,906
Well, all right. I'm sorry.

400
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:34,118
Harder!

401
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,997
Come on, colonel.

402
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:11,189
I hope that man Schroeder
believes that girl's story.

403
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:15,489
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better
think twice about calling her a liar.

404
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:22,241
What about Miller and Reynolds?

405
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:27,124
What about them, colonel?

406
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:32,955
Yes.

407
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,707
I suppose they...

408
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,676
Let's move it.

409
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:02,686
Do you have the feeling
we're being followed?

410
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:05,402
About the last 10 minutes.

411
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:42,320
Next time you can play the corpse.

412
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:46,078
Yeah, you seem pretty good
with that thing, though.

413
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:48,321
Could have been luck.

414
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:40,704
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.

415
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:07,102
Partisans, thank God!

416
00:46:07,274 --> 00:46:09,313
Good morning.

417
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,525
Good morning.

418
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:30,745
What's the matter with him?
We've been looking for you.

419
00:46:30,919 --> 00:46:32,294
Be quiet.

420
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:35,083
You will make your report
to Maj. Petrovitch.

421
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,375
I think we've run into
bad company, colonel.

422
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,208
Yes, the leader.

423
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:27,921
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.

424
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:30,715
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?

425
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:33,759
It's Nicolai Lescovar.

426
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,137
The man I was sent to kill.

427
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:20,878
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.

428
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:23,344
So do I. Right in it.

429
00:48:25,977 --> 00:48:28,100
Do you think he's recognized you?

430
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,512
Yes, I think so.

431
00:49:35,704 --> 00:49:38,194
Lt. Col. Barnsby,
United States Rangers.

432
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:39,535
Maj. Mallory, sir.

433
00:49:48,173 --> 00:49:50,545
You got away from the Germans.

434
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:52,915
How?

435
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:54,922
We escaped.

436
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:08,853
Capt. Lescovar
has his doubts about that.

437
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,773
If you escaped, why were
the Germans not pursuing you?

438
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,737
We observed you for five miles
before we picked you up.

439
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:20,950
You should've observed that we killed
two Chetniks that were following us.

440
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,652
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.

441
00:50:25,246 --> 00:50:28,994
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.

442
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:33,785
Comrades of ours whom we had
infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...

443
00:50:33,962 --> 00:50:37,960
so now all links with our agent there
are broken, thanks to you.

444
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:42,381
I'm sorry.

445
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:45,883
The fact remains
that we're Allied officers.

446
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:48,629
There's no reason
we should be treated this way.

447
00:50:48,808 --> 00:50:51,844
I'm in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...

448
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,637
to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.

449
00:50:55,815 --> 00:50:59,313
We are informed
of many things by London...

450
00:50:59,484 --> 00:51:02,651
very few of them
ever seem to materialize.

451
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,279
However, you are right.

452
00:51:04,822 --> 00:51:07,360
I was informed of your mission.

453
00:51:07,533 --> 00:51:10,948
Personally, I doubt if it was
ever a practical one...

454
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,244
but now that you are here without
equipment, the question is academic.

455
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:22,251
And you, major, you came here
as an observer, perhaps?

456
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:23,619
No, sir.

457
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:26,667
I was charged with a mission
of my own.

458
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:28,164
It's confidential.

459
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:31,508
Confidential!

460
00:51:32,888 --> 00:51:35,213
Sometimes I get the impression...

461
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:38,177
that London looks
on this theatre of operations...

462
00:51:38,351 --> 00:51:42,348
as a convenient place for conducting
what they call "war games."

463
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,229
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.

464
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,858
- I mean alone.
- No.

465
00:51:50,779 --> 00:51:54,230
The People's Army does not conduct
military business in secret.

466
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:56,525
Very well, sir.

467
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,994
I was sent here to identify a German
agent, code name Nicolai.

468
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,532
We are reliably informed...

469
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:07,917
that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...

470
00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:10,042
as Capt. Lescovar.

471
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:13,877
And having identified this man,
what were your further orders?

472
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:16,376
I was to eliminate him, sir.

473
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:22,304
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.

474
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,971
Do you hear that, Lescovar?

475
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,724
The gentlemen from London
want us to shoot you.

476
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,899
I'm sorry, major.

477
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:48,363
I must admit you are
indeed partly right.

478
00:52:48,537 --> 00:52:52,036
There was an agent
named Nicolai...

479
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:57,034
operating somewhere south of here
and also calling himself Lescovar.

480
00:52:57,211 --> 00:53:01,919
But he was identified many
months ago. And eliminated.

481
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:05,091
The British were informed.

482
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:11,553
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...

483
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:13,846
and just as frequently wrong!

484
00:53:14,017 --> 00:53:16,768
Lt. Marko,
see that these gentlemen...

485
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:20,768
give you a full report on their
activities in the Chetnik camp.

486
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,644
A specific report.

487
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:49,622
Well, captain, I guess we owe you
a bit of an apology, don't we?

488
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:53,878
Well, it happens. We all
get badly briefed sometimes.

489
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:57,920
Wish we had been briefed
about the men with the bandages.

490
00:53:58,305 --> 00:54:01,674
Replaced them with a couple
of your own, that's a good trick.

491
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,266
They were messengers to our agent
at Schroeder's headquarters.

492
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:08,188
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...

493
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:11,142
beautiful grey eyes
and shoots from the hip?

494
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:13,986
You mean Maritza?
Yes.

495
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:16,310
She took a big chance for us.

496
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,729
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter
for nothing.

497
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:33,623
We hold this end of the bridge.

498
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:36,629
Over there, the Germans
prepare for the final attack.

499
00:54:36,797 --> 00:54:40,212
We have been ordered to prevent
them crossing at all costs.

500
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,708
What exactly do they have
over there?

501
00:54:42,886 --> 00:54:46,669
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.

502
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:49,844
Soon they will bring up tanks, then...

503
00:54:50,726 --> 00:54:54,177
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.

504
00:54:55,104 --> 00:54:57,677
Each time we lost valuable men.

505
00:54:58,107 --> 00:55:01,606
Maj. Petrovitch has decided
it is impractical.

506
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:03,271
Well, he's wrong about that.

507
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:06,529
There's no bridge in the world
that can't be blown.

508
00:55:06,698 --> 00:55:09,532
That's what Force 10
was here to prove.

509
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:23,245
I told you before, you have no men,
you have no equipment.

510
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,169
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.

511
00:55:27,341 --> 00:55:31,587
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip
for a plane that may never arrive.

512
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,049
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.

513
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:36,629
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.

514
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:41,219
You mean you can blow 20
of my men to hell, for nothing!

515
00:55:41,978 --> 00:55:44,848
That bridge is indestructible.

516
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:47,804
Excuse me, sir,
you don't need 20 men.

517
00:55:47,983 --> 00:55:49,359
You need Miller.

518
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:52,361
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.

519
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:55,067
He's probably the best in England.

520
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,857
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.

521
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:02,071
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.

522
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:04,618
Not necessarily, major.

523
00:56:05,123 --> 00:56:08,990
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation
just to find out, colonel.

524
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:12,003
I need every single man
I've got here, now!

525
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:16,250
Sir, we don't need to mount
a full-scale operation.

526
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:18,500
Just give us two men.

527
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:56,999
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.

528
00:56:58,002 --> 00:57:01,453
You reported five prisoners, major.

529
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:07,880
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.

530
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:40,076
Maj. Schroeder is in the armoury,
and I have told you before...

531
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:44,161
this area is out of bounds
to you people, except Capt. Drazak.

532
00:57:46,586 --> 00:57:48,578
Kindly remove yourselves
immediately...

533
00:57:48,754 --> 00:57:53,332
and if you can read, which I doubt,
take a look at standing orders.

534
00:57:54,217 --> 00:57:56,542
There. You have made me
burn the milk.

535
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:57,964
So I did.

536
00:57:58,137 --> 00:57:59,631
Let it burn.

537
00:58:46,554 --> 00:58:48,297
Open up.

538
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:54,224
Prisoners for Maj. Schroeder.

539
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:19,363
You see, my colleague does not
believe you are deserters.

540
00:59:23,503 --> 00:59:25,828
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?

541
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:31,426
I thought you said these men
had been shot.

542
01:00:22,804 --> 01:00:24,464
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?

543
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:26,629
No!

544
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:32,935
This is not correct.

545
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:01,619
Quick. Miller!

546
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:38,864
Bring him. Open it.

547
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,548
- Go.
- Marko.

548
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,394
Partisan bitch!

549
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:21,066
Always so kind to the men
with burns.

550
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:25,149
But they have no burns.

551
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:41,256
The three Germans
with the prisoners that escaped...

552
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,124
all shot in the back
with machine pistols.

553
01:02:46,094 --> 01:02:47,754
You killed them.

554
01:03:08,655 --> 01:03:10,944
Good. Give me the hat.

555
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,597
Open. Open up.

556
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,144
Open!

557
01:03:46,772 --> 01:03:48,645
Open!

558
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,655
Milly.

559
01:05:48,126 --> 01:05:52,752
Weaver, don't stand there like
an idiot. Let's get this truck moving.

560
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,040
She okay?

561
01:05:59,678 --> 01:06:02,299
Well, we'll drive as carefully
as we can.

562
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,553
Hey, you.
I don't like the way you talk.

563
01:06:09,061 --> 01:06:12,097
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.

564
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:15,557
This truck doesn't move till somebody
tells me what's going on.

565
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:17,144
Now, look, you...

566
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:19,607
You bigtime officers
have shafted me twice.

567
01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:22,696
You tried to dump me in Italy,
ran out on me back there.

568
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:27,111
You expect me to drive you like some
chauffeur. Nobody tells me anything.

569
01:06:27,285 --> 01:06:30,321
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.

570
01:06:30,496 --> 01:06:34,363
Excuse me, but is your trouble
that you want to be part of the team?

571
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,866
I don't want to be a part
of any lousy team.

572
01:06:37,044 --> 01:06:39,830
I just want some equal consideration.

573
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,295
I don't think you'll get
equal consideration...

574
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,923
from those people back there.
Do you?

575
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,712
I don't care if they're
the U.S. Cavalry.

576
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:54,471
Nobody moves until somebody
tells me what you're planning to do.

577
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:57,892
- We're going to blow up a bridge.
- A bridge?

578
01:06:58,062 --> 01:07:00,635
Whose bridge?
Not me, I'm blowing up nothing.

579
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:04,515
We are going to help the Partisans
blow up a bridge...

580
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:07,397
and then if we're very lucky,
we can all go home.

581
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,571
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.

582
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:13,408
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.

583
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,651
You didn't give a mother-hunch
about me.

584
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:18,578
You came back for Miller,
but you didn't come for me?

585
01:07:18,913 --> 01:07:22,116
No, we didn't.

586
01:07:29,923 --> 01:07:32,592
That's the first straight answer
you've given me.

587
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:39,717
I think the major's
got a point, colonel.

588
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,297
They do look kind of mean,
don't they?

589
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:48,934
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
Get in there and drive the truck!

590
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:49,752
All right.

591
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:50,856
All right.

592
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:08,993
We'll have to do this another way.

593
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,204
Get away from the truck.

594
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:14,710
Wait for my signal.

595
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:14,542
Useful little insect, isn't he?

596
01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:20,593
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable showoff.

597
01:09:20,768 --> 01:09:23,473
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.

598
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:29,440
So now it works, huh, sergeant?

599
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:33,229
Well, these babies are
a little temperamental sometimes.

600
01:09:33,404 --> 01:09:35,443
Like me.

601
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,353
Lescovar's confirmed my signals
got through to London.

602
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:16,309
Do you like that chap?

603
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:19,483
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.

604
01:10:19,652 --> 01:10:21,728
I haven't thought anything
about him.

605
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:25,819
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?

606
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:30,703
All right, sergeant?

607
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:33,657
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?

608
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:36,536
Well, no, not exactly.

609
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:38,535
In fact, not by a long chalk.

610
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:41,415
I'd say you're flogging
a dead horse there, old man.

611
01:10:41,588 --> 01:10:44,375
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?

612
01:10:44,549 --> 01:10:47,170
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.

613
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,422
Oh, yeah?

614
01:10:48,594 --> 01:10:52,342
In that case, you'll have noticed
how it's built into the living rock.

615
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:56,511
And how those main pilings are not
just concrete, but 20 feet thick.

616
01:10:56,684 --> 01:10:58,143
That's not forgetting...

617
01:10:58,311 --> 01:11:01,395
I told you, London's dropping
the same stuff we had before.

618
01:11:01,564 --> 01:11:05,062
Yes, I know what you're getting,
but it's not gonna be enough.

619
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:08,732
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...

620
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:11,228
burn the paint work
here and there.

621
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:15,070
But nothing that would seriously
inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.

622
01:11:15,242 --> 01:11:19,286
Our experts have been studying
that bridge, and they say it'll blow.

623
01:11:19,454 --> 01:11:21,197
I don't know where you learned...

624
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:24,492
but I'm talking about
the best engineers in the business.

625
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:27,336
Yes. They're probably experts
at building things...

626
01:11:27,503 --> 01:11:29,744
whereas I'm an expert
at blowing them up.

627
01:11:29,921 --> 01:11:32,542
Take it from me that
one would need eight hours...

628
01:11:32,715 --> 01:11:34,838
to make a decent job
of that bridge.

629
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:36,207
Eight hours?

630
01:11:36,385 --> 01:11:40,596
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are
kind enough to leave us in peace.

631
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:43,006
And maybe provide
a few working lights.

632
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:46,519
You've seen those searchlights,
have you? Well, l...

633
01:11:46,686 --> 01:11:48,595
- Miller.
- Sir.

634
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,475
I think you've made
your technical point.

635
01:11:51,648 --> 01:11:53,557
Many thanks, sir.

636
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:59,062
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.

637
01:11:59,697 --> 01:12:02,947
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.

638
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:14,703
What would happen to the bridge
if that central arch...

639
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:18,826
was suddenly hit
by several million tons of water?

640
01:12:19,005 --> 01:12:20,749
- Water?
- Water?

641
01:12:21,257 --> 01:12:23,926
I think we've been talking
about the wrong target.

642
01:12:24,135 --> 01:12:26,590
Remember that dam we passed
up around the bend?

643
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:28,589
What kind of a dam?
Where is it?

644
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:30,597
Two and a half miles
up the river.

645
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:33,256
But, my dear chap,
why didn't you say so before?

646
01:12:33,435 --> 01:12:36,885
Oh, I could do a tremendous job
on a dam, yes.

647
01:12:37,063 --> 01:12:39,980
With a dam you've got natural
elements working for you.

648
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:43,766
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.

649
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,734
Thank you.

650
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,939
Come along, gentlemen.

651
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:56,282
As a technician, I thought you might
be interested in that dam, Milly.

652
01:12:56,454 --> 01:12:58,945
Get them outside
for the dropping zone.

653
01:13:04,461 --> 01:13:07,462
So the RAF drops the stuff
and we blow the dam, right?

654
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:08,793
Right.

655
01:13:08,965 --> 01:13:12,797
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.

656
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:14,961
Wouldn't know, old boy.

657
01:13:17,556 --> 01:13:21,007
How often have you used this
as a dropping zone?

658
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,054
Never.

659
01:13:23,228 --> 01:13:25,635
The Germans see to that.

660
01:13:25,813 --> 01:13:28,482
We have to keep moving around.

661
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:30,475
Makes sense.

662
01:13:32,152 --> 01:13:35,236
You think those two guys know
anything about blowing a dam?

663
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:38,074
Oh, no, I shouldn't think
they've got a clue.

664
01:13:38,574 --> 01:13:40,234
But never mind, old Weaver...

665
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:44,821
we sergeants will see them through
as usual.

666
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:49,583
- Right.
- Hello.

667
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:53,659
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.

668
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:55,415
Come on in, take a seat.

669
01:13:55,589 --> 01:13:58,673
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.

670
01:13:58,842 --> 01:14:02,376
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.

671
01:14:02,553 --> 01:14:04,676
No. I've seen too many airdrops.

672
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:07,634
They don't compare
to a nice, warm bed.

673
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:30,196
Would you believe it?
Right on time.

674
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:10,998
I don't believe it.

675
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:13,416
Poor bastards.

676
01:17:15,678 --> 01:17:18,133
This was no accident.

677
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:24,097
We've lost our last chance.

678
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:11,053
There is no question.
We were betrayed.

679
01:18:11,226 --> 01:18:14,227
Aren't we always
with Allied missions?

680
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:16,352
Their security's a joke.

681
01:18:16,522 --> 01:18:18,265
It doesn't matter.

682
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:20,848
We do our part,
and what do we get?

683
01:18:21,318 --> 01:18:23,145
Twenty lives lost.

684
01:18:23,695 --> 01:18:26,150
- One of them...
- It's past.

685
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,069
Finished.

686
01:18:31,118 --> 01:18:34,902
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshalling their tanks.

687
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,286
They will cross the bridge
tomorrow...

688
01:18:37,457 --> 01:18:40,576
and there is nothing
we can do to stop them.

689
01:18:41,419 --> 01:18:46,045
And you four gentlemen have
outstayed your usefulness.

690
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:50,544
You will be escorted back
to the Allied military mission.

691
01:18:50,718 --> 01:18:52,177
Out of harm's way?

692
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:56,258
Sir...

693
01:18:57,433 --> 01:19:00,682
I could leave the Germans
some very nasty surprises.

694
01:19:01,102 --> 01:19:03,391
Thank you, sergeant.

695
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:07,099
I think we have had
enough surprises.

696
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:13,822
Capt. Lescovar, see that these
gentlemen have an escort of two men.

697
01:19:29,085 --> 01:19:32,204
If those chaps had just half
the equipment of the Jerries...

698
01:19:32,379 --> 01:19:35,131
I could've made that dam
look like a Swiss cheese.

699
01:19:35,299 --> 01:19:37,374
It's absolutely sickening.

700
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:41,417
Do you think the Jerries will have that
gear we need in their supply dump?

701
01:19:41,596 --> 01:19:42,758
Of course they would.

702
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:47,307
Lashings of HE, land mines,
detonators, everything.

703
01:19:47,476 --> 01:19:49,468
It's an absolute certainty.

704
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:52,395
Your escort, colonel.

705
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:55,814
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.

706
01:19:55,983 --> 01:19:59,482
I think we're going to need
rather more men than this, captain.

707
01:19:59,653 --> 01:20:03,271
My sergeant thinks that the Germans
have the necessary equipment...

708
01:20:03,448 --> 01:20:07,990
in their forward supply dump
so that the colonel can blow the dam.

709
01:20:10,162 --> 01:20:13,910
That means you'd have to get
into the marshalling yards at Mostar.

710
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:18,244
None of you speak enough German.

711
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:23,422
You need me to help.

712
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:26,334
Thank you, captain.

713
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:33,561
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?

714
01:21:45,745 --> 01:21:48,200
You look real beautiful,
you know that?

715
01:21:48,372 --> 01:21:51,491
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.

716
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,622
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?

717
01:21:54,794 --> 01:21:58,708
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.

718
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:41,582
Pity they didn't teach you German
at that school of yours.

719
01:22:41,751 --> 01:22:44,954
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.

720
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:54,753
These any use to you?

721
01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:56,720
No, tellermines is what we want.

722
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:59,925
They look like dirty
grey-green dinner plates.

723
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,515
Maybe they just haven't got any.

724
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,890
They have.

725
01:24:14,832 --> 01:24:18,117
I wonder what happened
to Barnsby and his truck.

726
01:24:18,293 --> 01:24:21,293
I've been asking myself
the same question.

727
01:24:21,462 --> 01:24:24,831
Well, we can't just stand here
like ducks in thunder.

728
01:24:26,383 --> 01:24:30,297
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.

729
01:24:56,076 --> 01:25:00,073
Barnsby should have been here
by now. Where the hell is he?

730
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:02,662
Beautiful.

731
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:06,373
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.

732
01:25:06,543 --> 01:25:09,413
Well, I'd rather do it now
than in some ditch.

733
01:25:09,587 --> 01:25:11,544
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...

734
01:25:11,714 --> 01:25:13,173
given peace and quiet.

735
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:16,258
These little sods
can be temperamental.

736
01:25:16,426 --> 01:25:20,506
The gubbins itself is harmless enough
but aren't we all, until detonated.

737
01:25:57,629 --> 01:25:59,455
For a moment
I thought we were off.

738
01:26:02,216 --> 01:26:05,086
Hey, where in the hell
have they gotten to?

739
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:09,679
You maniac.

740
01:26:09,848 --> 01:26:12,089
What the hell are you doing here?

741
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:16,263
I'll go and have a look around,
see if I can find them.

742
01:26:40,082 --> 01:26:43,118
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.

743
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,216
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.

744
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:53,008
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...

745
01:26:53,177 --> 01:26:55,057
but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

746
01:26:55,095 --> 01:26:56,975
But ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

747
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:12,853
Bloody hell.

748
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,317
What's up now?

749
01:27:15,488 --> 01:27:19,188
Some great ape of a sergeant,
he's sent Barnsby's truck away.

750
01:27:19,366 --> 01:27:20,528
Oh, no.

751
01:27:22,994 --> 01:27:24,654
Sergeant.

752
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:28,363
Be quiet. Listen to me.

753
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:32,705
There are two British commanders
in that cattle truck behind me.

754
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:38,544
I'm Col. Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field Intelligence Group.

755
01:27:39,758 --> 01:27:42,214
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.

756
01:27:43,095 --> 01:27:46,380
There is a third,
an American colonel...

757
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:49,225
in the truck which you
just sent away.

758
01:27:49,392 --> 01:27:51,135
I want to take them all together.

759
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,225
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.

760
01:27:57,065 --> 01:28:01,442
Go and assemble a squad
of armed men. Quickly and quietly.

761
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:03,235
And keep them out of sight.

762
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:06,447
Then report back to me.
Understand?

763
01:28:13,996 --> 01:28:18,373
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.

764
01:28:46,816 --> 01:28:48,275
All right, you guys, let's...

765
01:28:48,443 --> 01:28:50,103
Oh, man.

766
01:28:51,112 --> 01:28:53,234
The sacks, get them up here quick.

767
01:28:53,405 --> 01:28:56,988
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?

768
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:01,108
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.

769
01:29:04,582 --> 01:29:07,452
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.

770
01:29:07,626 --> 01:29:10,461
Help me get this stuff loaded
and get it on the truck.

771
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:36,226
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.

772
01:29:36,401 --> 01:29:39,236
Let's go. Easy.

773
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:42,029
Hold it.

774
01:29:42,906 --> 01:29:45,065
It's that man again.

775
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:48,279
I'll take care of him. Close the door.

776
01:29:59,212 --> 01:30:01,999
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.

777
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:15,884
All clear?

778
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,811
Give them a moment
to get out of sight.

779
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:34,665
That fool, Marko,
must have given himself away.

780
01:31:34,836 --> 01:31:36,461
I don't know how.

781
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:39,500
How in the hell are we gonna
get back across the river?

782
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:41,251
I mean, where are we going?

783
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:43,881
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.

784
01:31:45,888 --> 01:31:47,797
Sarajevo.

785
01:31:49,057 --> 01:31:51,726
That's where the train goes.

786
01:31:52,435 --> 01:31:54,143
No stops.

787
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:40,220
I'm sorry about Marko.

788
01:32:43,521 --> 01:32:44,979
Thank you.

789
01:32:46,148 --> 01:32:48,306
It's a risk we all take.

790
01:32:50,276 --> 01:32:53,977
He was a brave man
and a good friend.

791
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:57,362
Pity he got careless.

792
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,284
Do you think that big sergeant
spotted him as a Partisan?

793
01:33:03,121 --> 01:33:05,160
I can't buy that.

794
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:08,453
The sergeant wasn't that bright.

795
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:14,876
He saluted you,
you're wearing a corporal's uniform.

796
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,163
That doesn't rate a salute
in the German army.

797
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,001
Not in anybody's army.

798
01:33:23,222 --> 01:33:25,677
Why do you think
he saluted you, Lescovar?

799
01:33:31,854 --> 01:33:36,147
Perhaps he recognized
my natural superiority.

800
01:33:36,566 --> 01:33:38,523
Yes, perhaps.

801
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:50,692
You say this train goes
to Sarajevo, no stops?

802
01:33:51,871 --> 01:33:53,246
Yeah.

803
01:33:54,749 --> 01:33:59,659
But I noticed on the map that we pass
within a half a mile of the dam.

804
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:03,503
Strange you didn't bother
to mention that.

805
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:16,220
Now, what's all this about?

806
01:34:17,227 --> 01:34:19,183
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...

807
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:22,307
and I forget to mention
that we pass near the dam.

808
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:30,111
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.

809
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:33,651
I don't think he gave anything away...

810
01:34:33,949 --> 01:34:35,858
except his life.

811
01:34:37,911 --> 01:34:40,615
What did you give away, Lescovar?

812
01:35:00,097 --> 01:35:02,932
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?

813
01:35:03,642 --> 01:35:07,176
I don't think, I know.

814
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,559
I've always known.

815
01:35:09,814 --> 01:35:11,853
I just couldn't prove it.

816
01:35:14,443 --> 01:35:16,269
You're Nicolai.

817
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,769
You're the man who
blew us in Greece.

818
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,759
Thank you, colonel.

819
01:35:52,309 --> 01:35:54,467
I've done your job.

820
01:35:55,603 --> 01:35:57,845
You help me do mine.

821
01:36:42,685 --> 01:36:43,930
Oh, crikey.

822
01:36:45,563 --> 01:36:47,472
It's lit like a Christmas tree.

823
01:36:52,527 --> 01:36:54,187
Dawn's around 5:30.

824
01:36:55,446 --> 01:36:56,988
Gives us an hour to get in...

825
01:36:57,156 --> 01:37:00,940
half-hour to set the charges
and 20 minutes to get clear.

826
01:37:02,578 --> 01:37:05,863
What you need, sir,
is a little diversion, isn't it?

827
01:39:55,101 --> 01:39:58,802
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.

828
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,387
Try and imagine you're a dog.

829
01:40:02,108 --> 01:40:06,021
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road!

830
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:41,550
Hallelujah!

831
01:41:21,301 --> 01:41:24,052
Just unroll it and string it out.

832
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:19,769
Come on, blackie.

833
01:43:22,989 --> 01:43:24,816
Come on, blackie.

834
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:27,694
Come on.

835
01:43:38,127 --> 01:43:42,125
Hey. You bleed red blood,
eh, blackie?

836
01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:37,269
Here.

837
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:39,366
Right here.

838
01:47:27,951 --> 01:47:28,982
You all right?

839
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:11,355
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!

840
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:14,614
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.

841
01:48:14,783 --> 01:48:17,949
If they'd been caught,
we'd have heard the alarm go off.

842
01:49:54,661 --> 01:49:56,867
How long do we make the fuse?

843
01:49:57,288 --> 01:50:00,703
They're Germans,
they're gonna be punctual.

844
01:50:00,874 --> 01:50:02,867
Usually are.

845
01:50:10,716 --> 01:50:12,543
We've run out of time.

846
01:50:18,556 --> 01:50:20,015
Twenty seconds?

847
01:50:20,433 --> 01:50:22,010
What do you say?

848
01:50:22,268 --> 01:50:24,675
It's your decision, colonel.

849
01:50:28,523 --> 01:50:30,516
I'm asking you.

850
01:50:32,902 --> 01:50:37,528
Twenty seconds sounds about right,
then we won't have so far to run.

851
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:51,667
It would have been nice
to see that bridge go, huh?

852
01:50:51,835 --> 01:50:53,662
Yes, wouldn't it?

853
01:50:56,214 --> 01:51:00,128
All been very interesting,
though, hasn't it?

854
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:02,333
Yes.

855
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:30,439
It didn't do a goddamn thing! Nothing!

856
01:52:51,188 --> 01:52:55,517
Miller! That useless git!

857
01:52:55,692 --> 01:52:58,017
- It didn't...
- What?

858
01:52:58,194 --> 01:53:02,357
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!

859
01:53:02,531 --> 01:53:05,567
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

860
01:53:05,742 --> 01:53:09,656
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!

861
01:53:13,874 --> 01:53:15,534
Nothing!

862
01:53:15,709 --> 01:53:17,951
We've been through
all this, and nothing!

863
01:53:18,128 --> 01:53:20,001
Nothing but:

864
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:25,374
You can't expect an enormous volcano
with three tiny bags of explosives.

865
01:53:26,427 --> 01:53:29,178
You have to let nature take her course.

866
01:53:29,596 --> 01:53:31,719
Give it time, it'll work.

867
01:54:11,591 --> 01:54:14,544
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!

868
01:56:29,043 --> 01:56:32,707
- You son of a bitch! - I told you,
it's only a matter of waiting.

869
01:56:39,635 --> 01:56:44,296
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.

870
01:56:44,473 --> 01:56:48,517
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a... You did it!

871
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,729
Why, you limey genius, I love you!

872
01:56:51,896 --> 01:56:53,603
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.

873
01:56:53,772 --> 01:56:55,564
You did it!

874
02:01:22,671 --> 02:01:25,043
Miller, you horrible little man...

875
02:01:25,215 --> 02:01:28,050
you knew that was gonna be
a slow-motion explosion.

876
02:01:28,218 --> 02:01:30,506
You deliberately didn't tell me,
did you?

877
02:01:30,678 --> 02:01:33,216
I didn't want to bore you
with technical detail.

878
02:01:33,389 --> 02:01:35,630
I thought it might be
a bit over your head.

879
02:01:35,807 --> 02:01:37,301
What happened to you?

880
02:01:37,476 --> 02:01:39,349
He bit me in all the excitement.

881
02:01:39,519 --> 02:01:42,603
But damn it to hell, we did it,
colonel, we did it!

882
02:01:42,772 --> 02:01:44,978
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did!

883
02:01:45,149 --> 02:01:47,058
And a merry Christmas.

884
02:01:47,234 --> 02:01:51,148
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.

885
02:01:52,655 --> 02:01:53,770
But before...

886
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:57,815
we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...

887
02:01:58,325 --> 02:02:01,330
and Congressional Medals of Honor
and so on...

888
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,870
and so forth and such like...

889
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:08,630
I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.

890
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:13,960
That two: We have no hope
whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.

891
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:15,670
And that three:

892
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:21,845
This neck of the woods will soon be
crawling with bad-tempered Germans.

893
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:23,720
And four:

894
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,430
I don't think that our little genius,
Sgt. Miller there...

895
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,180
has even got a box of matches
left in his suitcase.

896
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:36,980
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...

897
02:02:37,235 --> 02:02:41,700
that we are going to have
a very long walk home.
