1
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,482
Deep in the heart of the Aegean
lies the island of Navarone.

2
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,801
In 1943, it stood lik e a thorn
in the Allied side.

3
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:42,841
Newly designed radar-controlled guns
set in the heart of the ancient rock...

4
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,082
...gave the German High Command
total strategic dominance.

5
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,880
Air strik es and naval attacks
had proven costly and ineffective.

6
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,883
In desperation, the Allies turned
to infiltration.

7
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,962
On the night of September the 24th, a
specially trained commando group...

8
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,804
...succeeded in penetrating
the very heart of the gun complex...

9
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,564
...planted explosives at the base
of the giant shell hoists...

10
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:12,280
...then withdrew to await rescue
by ships of the <i>R</i>oyal Navy.

11
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,879
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 reps.

12
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,243
Fire!

13
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,122
Move! Move!

14
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,722
Come on, move it!

15
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,720
Move it!

16
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,638
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

17
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:26,519
Regulations state, sir, that in the
absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...

18
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,647
...the acting catering officer,
that's you, sir...

19
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:33,245
...shall authorize once per week,
the issue of offal.

20
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,762
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...

21
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,489
...is kidneys, liver,
tongue, brains...

22
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,526
Well, I'll be damned!

23
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,884
- Milly, how nice to see you!
- Hello, sir.

24
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,517
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.

25
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,441
I'm reporting to Cmdr. Jensen.

26
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:50,397
I gather you've been hurling yourself
over the white cliffs. How's the leg?

27
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,925
It's in the same place. I thought
they pensioned you off for good.

28
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:56,319
You still peddling
those whiz-bangs of yours?

29
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,162
Yes, we've got things that go boom
for all occasions.

30
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,127
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting...

31
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,849
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Cmdr. Jensen waiting.

32
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,002
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, together.

33
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:14,245
Corporal, put that in my office,
will you?

34
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:20,922
Mallory.

35
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,728
Take a pew. How's the leg?

36
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,800
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,358
Hear you've been attached
to Winston's toy shop.

38
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,566
"Department of Dirty Tricks"
as the Whitehall chaps call it.

39
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,799
Well, they speak very well of you.

40
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,679
Right. We need you chaps
for something rather special.

41
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:45,327
I'm afraid it's not exactly
a masterpiece...

42
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:48,527
...but I wonder if you can identify
this fellow.

43
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,081
Think back to Navarone.

44
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,157
I'd rather not, sir.

45
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:58,842
Nicolai?

46
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,038
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?

47
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,643
But what about him?

48
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,607
Andrea's people had him shot
as a traitor, didn't they?

49
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,282
Yes, so we were told.

50
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,677
In fact, he escaped.

51
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,283
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...

52
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,124
...who we believe is operating now
in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...

53
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,519
...posing as one Capt. Lescovar.

54
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,568
Now, you both knew Nicolai.

55
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,166
In fact, you're the only people we know
of can make a positive identification.

56
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,968
So I'd like you to go out there
and cope.

57
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,279
Cope, sir?

58
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,122
Kill him.

59
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,484
Discreetly, if possible.

60
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,004
But I'm a civilian now, sir.

61
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,522
Yes, we thought about that.

62
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,283
So you've been recalled
to the current and promoted.

63
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,928
Staff sergeant.

64
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,442
Awfully generous, sir.

65
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,645
Exactly how do we get there?

66
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,686
We're tacking you onto Force 10.

67
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,285
The code name for an operation
for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.

68
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,407
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?

69
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,037
It's being treated
on a need-to-know basis.

70
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,609
And you don't need to know.

71
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:02,280
And you don't need to know.

72
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,038
Barnsby, come in.

73
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:13,158
- Sir?
- Colonel.

74
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,207
Force 10 flies out tonight.

75
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,203
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.

76
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:20,763
I beg your pardon, sir?

77
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:23,727
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.

78
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,449
Just a sideshow.
This is Maj. Mallory, Sgt. Miller.

79
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,361
Lt. Col. Barnsby.

80
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,322
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been
planned down to the last detail.

81
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,925
The last thing we need are
a couple of passengers.

82
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,047
Maj. Mallory does have a certain
amount of experience.

83
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,483
I wouldn't doubt it.

84
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,209
We're talking about
some hard travelling, sir.

85
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:47,679
We've gotta move fast. My men
are young, in top physical shape.

86
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,804
- They're specially trained for this.
- I'm aware of that.

87
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,565
Sir, I am concerned about the safety
of my command.

88
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,197
Well, these chaps have got
a job to do as well.

89
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:01,327
And it's up to you to deliver them
safely to the Partisans.

90
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,719
And you leave for Italy
at 2300 hours...

91
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,687
...and you take off for Yugoslavia
the following night.

92
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:08,726
Very well, sir.

93
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,483
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.

94
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:17,399
Well, we'll do our best not to make
a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.

95
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:41,878
All right, enough!

96
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:54,124
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...

97
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:59,682
...we might be going to Yugoslavia
by walking on water.

98
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:08,765
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.

99
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,601
Stop it.

100
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,966
Nolan, kill the lights.
All right, out.

101
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,997
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.

102
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,805
You're gonna miss your plane
unless you join us now, major.

103
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,566
Remarkable way of getting
on an aircraft, don't you think so?

104
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:47,720
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?

105
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,484
It's not easy if you insist on climbing
through fences in the dark...

106
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:55,403
...when there's a perfectly good gate
half a mile up the road.

107
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,607
Anything we can do to help?

108
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,488
Yeah, you can keep quiet
and out of the way, major.

109
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,159
I don't have a lot of time
for explanations.

110
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,001
One thing that you don't know...

111
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:13,922
...is the last three Allied missions
into Yugoslavia...

112
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:16,125
...were blown right here in Italy.

113
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,882
So this time when we fly out, we're
not advertising the fact to anybody.

114
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,799
Holy cow, will you look
at those guys!

115
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,960
They're stealing half the field.

116
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,721
All right, hold it.

117
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,288
Wait for me.

118
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,569
Okay, men, let's go!

119
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,887
- Blake, take care of Rastus there.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:04,040
Okay, fellas, freeze.

121
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,642
Back off. Come on, get back.

122
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,686
And you, back, back!

123
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:11,239
Bill, Eddie, fetch those other guys
out of there.

124
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,242
What's your name, kid?

125
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,001
Walter.

126
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,642
What's yours?

127
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:58,369
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.

128
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,401
Walter.

129
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,157
Good evening.

130
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:23,241
Major, move!

131
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,680
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.

132
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:29,885
We're very much obliged to you,
sergeant.

133
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,880
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sgt. Weaver. Thank you.

134
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,960
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

135
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,120
- But, sir!
- All set, colonel.

136
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,120
- Still stuff outside?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,084
- Okay, Oberstein?
- Fine.

138
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:48,360
Hey, sir!

139
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,322
Where's Nolan?

140
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,526
I think you can take it
he won't be joining us.

141
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,363
Okay, let's go.

142
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:06,608
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...

143
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,043
...and you run out on me.

144
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,120
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.

145
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,281
Hey, man, don't push!
Don't push me!

146
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:16,437
- Look, you!
- I think it's a bit late for that now.

147
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,561
Look, you just shouldn't have
left me there. I saved you bums.

148
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,527
Well, we didn't think you'd like
where we're going.

149
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,725
You let me worry about that, huh?

150
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,559
That guy's gonna melt
into the landscape.

151
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:01,438
Yeah, them Partisans are gonna think
they've been invaded by Zulus.

152
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:04,200
Well, you are one man short.

153
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,566
Well, Nolan can handle a chute,
at least.

154
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:12,526
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.

155
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:15,408
That's right, you learn
on the way down.

156
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,486
I'd better go tell the colonel
we got us another passenger.

157
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,881
I think the colonel's got enough on
his plate for the moment, don't you?

158
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,921
So sorry.

159
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,558
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.

160
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,163
You never know.
It might come in useful.

161
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,369
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?

162
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:01,963
My pyjamas.

163
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,518
Looks like high-explosive pyjamas
to me.

164
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:05,917
Not to worry, old boy.

165
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,446
Been handling this since I blew up
the nursery with my first chemistry set.

166
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,805
Poor old nanny.

167
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,523
We got company.

168
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,766
Cut two!

169
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:33,724
Reynolds, bail out!

170
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:38,763
Jump!

171
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,328
Go!

172
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,764
Come on, move it!

173
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,447
Come on, get out!

174
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,361
Come on, move!

175
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,167
Come on!

176
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,241
Mallory.

177
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:40,761
Okay.

178
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,444
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down!

179
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,801
Come on.

180
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,760
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.

181
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:35,238
Where's your Sgt. Miller?

182
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:13,408
How the hell did he get here?

183
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,085
You let him on the plane?

184
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:20,048
I think he more or less
invited himself.

185
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,520
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.

186
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,919
You don't call him man.
You call him sir, and you call me sir.

187
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:43,968
And as long as you're here, you do
as you're told. Understood, soldier?

188
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:52,519
Yes, sir.

189
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,646
We've gotta get out of here
before that patrol comes back.

190
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:00,642
Lt. Reynolds, take point.
Sgt. Weaver, bring up the rear.

191
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,881
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.

192
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,205
Organized young gentleman,
isn't he?

193
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:43,801
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.

194
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:46,961
If we keep going east, we'll
end up where we're supposed to.

195
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:49,563
How did we get stuck
with those two clowns?

196
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:53,642
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.

197
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,846
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.

198
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,046
Do you think that young man has
any idea where we are, Milly?

199
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:03,804
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.

200
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,768
I'll go and try and find out.

201
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,489
Yes, why don't you do that.

202
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,079
Excuse me, colonel.

203
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,400
Do you have any idea
where we are?

204
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:17,321
I've got a good idea where we are.

205
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:21,004
And how long it's gonna take to get
there, if you two can't keep up.

206
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,523
All right, let's move it.

207
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:42,518
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvellous.

208
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,328
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.

209
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,609
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.

210
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,123
Yes.

211
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:54,043
I've often thought that I'd rather like
to settle down there some day.

212
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,242
Looks like you're gonna have
to change your plans.

213
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,240
Take it easy.

214
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,119
Welcome.

215
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:24,439
Capt. Drazak.

216
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:27,043
Seventeenth Partisan Regiment.

217
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:29,723
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!

218
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:32,357
Thank you, Capt. Drazak.

219
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:35,078
They frightened you with bandages,
huh?

220
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,479
Without bandages you...

221
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:41,328
German, how you say:

222
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:43,207
You say, "flamethrower."

223
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:45,644
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.

224
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:48,128
Hello! Hello!

225
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:50,041
How do you do?

226
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:55,244
This is Maritza,
good soldier comrade.

227
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:58,526
How do you do,
good soldier comrade?

228
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,200
Hello, blackie.

229
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:21,727
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.

230
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,321
Back off, soldier.

231
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,360
I make big joke...

232
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:52,049
...but joke on me.

233
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:06,363
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.

234
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:09,805
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.

235
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,243
Come.

236
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,718
Come, we go.

237
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:23,638
Where did you learn to punch
like that? Harvard?

238
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:26,607
No, Harlem. Colonel?

239
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,887
I'm not trying to get anybody
killed, least of all me.

240
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:34,201
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.

241
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,328
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.

242
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:53,164
Good, good. Well, it looks like
things may work out after all, huh?

243
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:56,844
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still
carry out our little sideshow.

244
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:58,761
Sorry about Force 10.

245
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:01,318
You're down to two men, aren't you?

246
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,878
Of course, I don't know
what your mission was...

247
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:08,361
...but obviously it just isn't
on now, is it, colonel?

248
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:44,447
Looks rather like your own youngster,
doesn't he?

249
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,281
Do you really think so?

250
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,920
Please, come.

251
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:01,478
Come, eat.

252
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,800
We are Chetniks...

253
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,119
...not stinking Partisans.

254
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:30,124
We hunt Allied commandos
like wild pigs!

255
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,849
We work with Germans.
They are our friends!

256
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:42,122
Good evening, gentlemen.

257
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,598
Maj. Schroeder, 11 th army corps.

258
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:47,203
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.

259
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,325
We thought these people were
Partisans.

260
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:52,287
- Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
- Sure.

261
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:55,407
Chetniks? Who would have
believed that?

262
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,766
The other three Allied missions
that fell into our hands...

263
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:02,127
...were not quite so happy about it
as you appear to be.

264
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,121
I'm not surprised, sir.

265
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:08,282
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.

266
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,162
Deserters?

267
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:14,799
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.

268
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:19,038
You see, we were
in a prison camp in Termoli.

269
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:20,198
We escaped.

270
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:23,361
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.

271
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:28,205
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and
landed in your territory, thank God.

272
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,601
Fascinating.

273
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:35,477
Tell me, why exactly
did you desert?

274
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,719
Now, I'm glad you asked that.

275
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:39,642
Yes.

276
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,324
Well, I am afraid
that is rather a long story.

277
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:47,323
Oh, please, you must not
be afraid of boring me.

278
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,404
Have you ever heard of penicillin?

279
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:52,844
No.

280
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:56,645
Well, I'm not surprised.
It's new.

281
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,607
It's a drug that prevents wounds
from becoming infected.

282
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,284
It cures a whole range of infections...

283
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:05,327
...including some of the nastier
social diseases.

284
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:09,562
It's become one of the most
sought-after items on the black market.

285
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:13,005
Our friend here, Sgt. Weaver
of the American Medical Corps...

286
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:15,478
...was our supplier.

287
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:23,160
You are saying you stole these drugs
from the Army to sell to civilians?

288
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:28,999
Not just to civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.

289
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,318
Any army.

290
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:32,882
I see.

291
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:39,043
Tell me, what has all this to do
with that suitcase you keep looking at?

292
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:41,803
Well, that suitcase
is full of our penicillin.

293
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:45,002
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?

294
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:46,761
Certainly, major.

295
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,442
Open it, Miller.

296
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,478
You can't do that here,
you'd ruin the lot.

297
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:55,846
You know perfectly well that
any contamination will destroy it.

298
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:58,125
It must be opened
under laboratory conditions.

299
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,122
There's nearly half a million
pounds worth of stuff here.

300
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:04,599
I know all that, but the major
is not interested in our penicillin.

301
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,566
He only wants to know the truth.

302
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:09,926
What's the use of a half a million
pounds to you out here?

303
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:15,402
Yes, well, that's beside the point,
sir, but I'm not going to open it.

304
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:21,999
Our story doesn't seem
to convince you.

305
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:24,160
No, it does not.

306
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:27,207
That's up to you, but every word
he's told you is true.

307
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,361
If you don't believe it,
check with your intelligence.

308
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,326
They'll verify the entire story.

309
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:36,038
Oh, I shall certainly verify
your story.

310
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,806
Every word of it.

311
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,360
Get in!

312
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:53,689
Cute story, major, very cute.

313
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:56,922
Now, what happens
when they open the suitcase?

314
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,638
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?

315
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,200
Headquarters acknowledges
your signal.

316
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,121
Thank you, Bauer.

317
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:34,278
Maritza...

318
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:37,806
...what do you think?

319
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:40,006
They're lying.

320
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,399
What does it matter, anyway?

321
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,604
Kill them.

322
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:47,359
Yeah, you are probably right.

323
00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:52,640
Do you know what I was thinking?

324
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:55,118
After the war, $1 million.

325
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:58,486
You, a simple peasant girl
from where?

326
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:01,880
I can never pronounce the name
of the place you come from.

327
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:13,768
With so much money, we could...

328
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,282
They're lying.

329
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,201
Kill them.

330
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:29,368
Out! Get out.

331
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,361
What did I tell you?

332
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:18,407
Well, at least we got
a good night's sleep.

333
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:31,325
Good morning, gentlemen.

334
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:36,563
Our intelligence confirms
your escape from Italy.

335
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,162
You and you, follow me, please.

336
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:55,887
Your escape from Italy
is one thing.

337
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,963
The rest of your story
is something else.

338
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:02,440
I had time to sleep on it.

339
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:05,919
So this morning,
you know what I did?

340
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,921
I opened the suitcase.

341
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:12,478
Maritza!

342
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,479
And what do you think I found?

343
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,441
Firewood.

344
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:32,004
What did you expect? We buried it
before your Chetniks picked us up.

345
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:35,366
We're not stupid. It's the only thing
we've got to bargain with.

346
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:39,204
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.

347
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:42,645
You know they're lying. Why don't
you let Drazak get rid of them?

348
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,447
Gently, Maritza.

349
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,045
I don't believe your so-called penicillin
exists, but it just might.

350
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:50,882
So I will let you go
and dig it up for me.

351
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:56,479
And if we do, you'll shoot us
and bury us in the same hole.

352
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:59,083
I shall certainly shoot you
if you don't.

353
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,838
Well, gentlemen,
the choice is yours.

354
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:36,206
What I can't figure is how
the firewood got in the case.

355
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,280
Neither can I.

356
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:42,601
Don't know where we're going to find
any spare penicillin here, do you?

357
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:46,239
What are we going to do, keep
walking until we reach the Adriatic?

358
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,162
I don't think the iron maiden
will let us get that far.

359
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,887
Halt!

360
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:55,122
What did I tell you?

361
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:58,361
We are three miles past the spot
where you were picked up.

362
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:01,566
Well, where is this
wonderful treasure?

363
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,924
In your imagination?

364
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,398
No, ma'am,
it's not in our imagination.

365
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:08,799
I think it's a bit further on,
don't you?

366
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:12,120
Yes, it is. Well, I mean,
it's not much further than this.

367
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:14,723
It's hard to tell,
the whole country looks alike.

368
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:17,323
You will start digging
within five minutes.

369
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:21,324
What if we haven't found it
in five minutes?

370
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,482
Then you will be digging
your graves.

371
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,646
Hey, colonel.

372
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,720
Wait a minute,
now this looks familiar.

373
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:54,608
Isn't this our little hollow
down here?

374
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:57,567
Yes, I think it is.

375
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:02,118
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.

376
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:03,927
I think this is it.

377
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:05,681
- This knoll over here?
- Right.

378
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,285
You see, comrade, we lined it up
between them...

379
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,838
There you are!
There's our pile of stones.

380
00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:26,326
Gotta get them closer
and we use the spades.

381
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,723
You take the two
that are closest to you...

382
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,847
...and I'll take the other one
and the broad.

383
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,045
I'm gonna get them
closer now, okay?

384
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:59,039
Fritz. Fritz, come!
It's here.

385
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:04,648
- Ready?
- All right.

386
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,289
You can get up now.
They're dead.

387
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:26,084
I put firewood in people's cases
and hide their high explosives.

388
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:27,682
Don't sit there gawping.

389
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,000
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.

390
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,127
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.

391
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:36,041
Now, go.

392
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:38,484
Excuse me,
good comrade soldier...

393
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:42,722
...but exactly what story are you
gonna tell Schroeder about all this?

394
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:45,639
You took us by surprise.

395
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:47,640
You got away.

396
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:50,282
Here, hit me.

397
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:54,802
Did you expect me to go back there
with my hair combed?

398
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:55,958
Hit me!

399
00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:00,126
Well, all right. I'm sorry.

400
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:04,166
Harder!

401
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,927
Come on, colonel.

402
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:39,723
I hope that man Schroeder
believes that girl's story.

403
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:43,848
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better
think twice about calling her a liar.

404
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:50,324
What about Miller and Reynolds?

405
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:55,008
What about them, colonel?

406
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,601
Yes.

407
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,199
I suppose they...

408
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,047
Let's move it.

409
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:29,118
Do you have the feeling
we're being followed?

410
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:31,723
About the last 10 minutes.

411
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:04,684
Next time you can play the corpse.

412
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,288
Yeah, you seem pretty good
with that thing, though.

413
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:10,440
Could have been luck.

414
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,684
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.

415
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:26,004
Partisans, thank God!

416
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:28,125
Good morning.

417
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:30,247
Good morning.

418
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:48,682
What's the matter with him?
We've been looking for you.

419
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:50,168
Be quiet.

420
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:52,843
You will make your report
to Maj. Petrovitch.

421
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:39,163
I think we've run into
bad company, colonel.

422
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:40,921
Yes, the leader.

423
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,523
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.

424
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:46,203
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?

425
00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:49,123
It's Nicolai Lescovar.

426
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:52,363
The man I was sent to kill.

427
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:34,318
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.

428
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:36,684
So do I. Right in it.

429
00:46:39,209 --> 00:46:41,245
Do you think he's recognized you?

430
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:43,559
Yes, I think so.

431
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:48,478
Lt. Col. Barnsby,
United States Rangers.

432
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:49,764
Maj. Mallory, sir.

433
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:00,324
You got away from the Germans.

434
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:02,598
How?

435
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:04,523
We escaped.

436
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:17,885
Capt. Lescovar
has his doubts about that.

437
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:21,645
If you escaped, why were
the Germans not pursuing you?

438
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,447
We observed you for five miles
before we picked you up.

439
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:29,488
You should've observed that we killed
two Chetniks that were following us.

440
00:48:29,649 --> 00:48:33,039
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.

441
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:37,204
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.

442
00:48:38,409 --> 00:48:41,799
Comrades of ours whom we had
infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...

443
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:45,803
...so now all links with our agent there
are broken, thanks to you.

444
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,044
I'm sorry.

445
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:53,403
The fact remains
that we're Allied officers.

446
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:56,037
There's no reason
we should be treated this way.

447
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:59,121
I'm in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...

448
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:02,759
...to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.

449
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:06,285
We are informed
of many things by London...

450
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:09,486
...very few of them
ever seem to materialize.

451
00:49:09,649 --> 00:49:11,048
However, you are right.

452
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:14,003
I was informed of your mission.

453
00:49:14,169 --> 00:49:17,445
Personally, I doubt if it was
ever a practical one...

454
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:22,524
...but now that you are here without
equipment, the question is academic.

455
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:28,286
And you, major, you came here
as an observer, perhaps?

456
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:29,598
No, sir.

457
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,522
I was charged with a mission
of my own.

458
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:33,958
It's confidential.

459
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:37,165
Confidential!

460
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,719
Sometimes I get the impression...

461
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:43,562
...that London looks
on this theatre of operations...

462
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:47,563
...as a convenient place for conducting
what they call "war games."

463
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:51,285
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.

464
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:52,848
- I mean alone.
- No.

465
00:49:55,649 --> 00:49:58,959
The People's Army does not conduct
military business in secret.

466
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:01,161
Very well, sir.

467
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:05,447
I was sent here to identify a German
agent, code name Nicolai.

468
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:07,882
We are reliably informed...

469
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:12,088
...that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...

470
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:14,126
...as Capt. Lescovar.

471
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:17,804
And having identified this man,
what were your further orders?

472
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,201
I was to eliminate him, sir.

473
00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:25,887
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.

474
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:28,445
Do you hear that, Lescovar?

475
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:32,045
The gentlemen from London
want us to shoot you.

476
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:47,560
I'm sorry, major.

477
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:50,882
I must admit you are
indeed partly right.

478
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,405
There was an agent
named Nicolai...

479
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:59,199
...operating somewhere south of here
and also calling himself Lescovar.

480
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:03,885
But he was identified many
months ago. And eliminated.

481
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:06,927
The British were informed.

482
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:13,125
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...

483
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:15,325
...and just as frequently wrong!

484
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,128
Lt. Marko,
see that these gentlemen...

485
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:21,964
...give you a full report on their
activities in the Chetnik camp.

486
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:24,723
A specific report.

487
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:49,640
Well, captain, I guess we owe you
a bit of an apology, don't we?

488
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:53,722
Well, it happens. We all
get badly briefed sometimes.

489
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:57,599
Wish we had been briefed
about the men with the bandages.

490
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:01,200
Replaced them with a couple
of your own, that's a good trick.

491
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,645
They were messengers to our agent
at Schroeder's headquarters.

492
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:07,448
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...

493
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:10,282
...beautiful grey eyes
and shoots from the hip?

494
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:13,009
You mean Maritza?
Yes.

495
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:15,239
She took a big chance for us.

496
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:17,559
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter
for nothing.

497
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,845
We hold this end of the bridge.

498
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:34,728
Over there, the Germans
prepare for the final attack.

499
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:38,165
We have been ordered to prevent
them crossing at all costs.

500
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:40,559
What exactly do they have
over there?

501
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:44,358
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.

502
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:47,403
Soon they will bring up tanks, then...

503
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:51,559
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.

504
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:54,917
Each time we lost valuable men.

505
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:58,685
Maj. Petrovitch has decided
it is impractical.

506
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,282
Well, he's wrong about that.

507
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:03,407
There's no bridge in the world
that can't be blown.

508
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:06,288
That's what Force 10
was here to prove.

509
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:19,441
I told you before, you have no men,
you have no equipment.

510
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:23,204
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.

511
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:27,442
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip
for a plane that may never arrive.

512
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:29,804
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.

513
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:32,278
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.

514
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:36,681
You mean you can blow 20
of my men to hell, for nothing!

515
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:40,162
That bridge is indestructible.

516
00:53:40,529 --> 00:53:42,997
Excuse me, sir,
you don't need 20 men.

517
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:44,488
You need Miller.

518
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:47,368
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.

519
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:49,963
He's probably the best in England.

520
00:53:50,129 --> 00:53:53,599
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.

521
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:56,681
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.

522
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,124
Not necessarily, major.

523
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:03,318
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation
just to find out, colonel.

524
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:06,208
I need every single man
I've got here, now!

525
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:10,282
Sir, we don't need to mount
a full-scale operation.

526
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,440
Just give us two men.

527
00:54:45,169 --> 00:54:49,367
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.

528
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,639
You reported five prisoners, major.

529
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:59,804
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.

530
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:30,685
Maj. Schroeder is in the armoury,
and I have told you before...

531
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:34,603
...this area is out of bounds
to you people, except Capt. Drazak.

532
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:38,840
Kindly remove yourselves
immediately...

533
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:43,400
...and if you can read, which I doubt,
take a look at standing orders.

534
00:55:44,249 --> 00:55:46,479
There. You have made me
burn the milk.

535
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:47,843
So I did.

536
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:49,442
Let it burn.

537
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:36,121
Open up.

538
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:41,806
Prisoners for Maj. Schroeder.

539
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:05,918
You see, my colleague does not
believe you are deserters.

540
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:12,119
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?

541
00:57:14,929 --> 00:57:17,489
I thought you said these men
had been shot.

542
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:08,361
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?

543
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:10,438
No!

544
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:16,486
This is not correct.

545
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:43,999
Quick. Miller!

546
00:59:17,529 --> 00:59:19,724
Bring him. Open it.

547
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:39,563
- Go.
- Marko.

548
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:53,803
Partisan bitch!

549
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:00,203
Always so kind to the men
with burns.

550
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,119
But they have no burns.

551
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:19,568
The three Germans
with the prisoners that escaped...

552
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:23,278
...all shot in the back
with machine pistols.

553
01:00:24,209 --> 01:00:25,801
You killed them.

554
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:48,044
Good. Give me the hat.

555
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:17,446
Open. Open up.

556
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:21,807
Open!

557
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:24,206
Open!

558
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:18,888
Milly.

559
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:23,246
Weaver, don't stand there like
an idiot. Let's get this truck moving.

560
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:29,277
She okay?

561
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,403
Well, we'll drive as carefully
as we can.

562
01:03:35,569 --> 01:03:38,402
Hey, you.
I don't like the way you talk.

563
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:41,801
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.

564
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:45,120
This truck doesn't move till somebody
tells me what's going on.

565
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:46,642
Now, look, you...

566
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:49,004
You bigtime officers
have shafted me twice.

567
01:03:49,169 --> 01:03:51,967
You tried to dump me in Italy,
ran out on me back there.

568
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:56,202
You expect me to drive you like some
chauffeur. Nobody tells me anything.

569
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:59,281
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.

570
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:03,158
Excuse me, but is your trouble
that you want to be part of the team?

571
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:05,559
I don't want to be a part
of any lousy team.

572
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:08,402
I just want some equal consideration.

573
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:13,644
I don't think you'll get
equal consideration...

574
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,164
...from those people back there.
Do you?

575
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:18,839
I don't care if they're
the U.S. Cavalry.

576
01:04:19,009 --> 01:04:22,445
Nobody moves until somebody
tells me what you're planning to do.

577
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,726
- We're going to blow up a bridge.
- A bridge?

578
01:04:25,889 --> 01:04:28,357
Whose bridge?
Not me, I'm blowing up nothing.

579
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:32,079
We are going to help the Partisans
blow up a bridge...

580
01:04:32,249 --> 01:04:34,843
...and then if we're very lucky,
we can all go home.

581
01:04:35,249 --> 01:04:37,888
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.

582
01:04:38,049 --> 01:04:40,609
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.

583
01:04:40,769 --> 01:04:42,760
You didn't give a mother-hunch
about me.

584
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:45,568
You came back for Miller,
but you didn't come for me?

585
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:48,961
No, we didn't.

586
01:04:56,449 --> 01:04:59,009
That's the first straight answer
you've given me.

587
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:05,844
I think the major's
got a point, colonel.

588
01:05:06,009 --> 01:05:08,318
They do look kind of mean,
don't they?

589
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:14,684
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
Get in there and drive the truck!

590
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:15,569
All right.

591
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:16,445
All right.

592
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:33,924
We'll have to do this another way.

593
01:05:34,089 --> 01:05:36,045
Get away from the truck.

594
01:05:38,009 --> 01:05:39,408
Wait for my signal.

595
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:36,797
Useful little insect, isn't he?

596
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:42,601
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable showoff.

597
01:06:42,769 --> 01:06:45,363
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.

598
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:51,087
So now it works, huh, sergeant?

599
01:06:51,729 --> 01:06:54,721
Well, these babies are
a little temperamental sometimes.

600
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:56,845
Like me.

601
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:34,166
Lescovar's confirmed my signals
got through to London.

602
01:07:34,609 --> 01:07:36,042
Do you like that chap?

603
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:39,087
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.

604
01:07:39,249 --> 01:07:41,240
I haven't thought anything
about him.

605
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:45,164
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?

606
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:49,848
All right, sergeant?

607
01:07:50,009 --> 01:07:52,682
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?

608
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:55,443
Well, no, not exactly.

609
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:57,361
In fact, not by a long chalk.

610
01:07:57,529 --> 01:08:00,123
I'd say you're flogging
a dead horse there, old man.

611
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,962
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?

612
01:08:03,129 --> 01:08:05,643
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.

613
01:08:05,809 --> 01:08:06,844
Oh, yeah?

614
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:10,604
In that case, you'll have noticed
how it's built into the living rock.

615
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:14,603
And how those main pilings are not
just concrete, but 20 feet thick.

616
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:16,168
That's not forgetting...

617
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:19,287
I told you, London's dropping
the same stuff we had before.

618
01:08:19,449 --> 01:08:22,805
Yes, I know what you're getting,
but it's not gonna be enough.

619
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:26,325
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...

620
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:28,719
...burn the paint work
here and there.

621
01:08:28,889 --> 01:08:32,404
But nothing that would seriously
inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.

622
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:36,448
Our experts have been studying
that bridge, and they say it'll blow.

623
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:38,281
I don't know where you learned...

624
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:41,441
...but I'm talking about
the best engineers in the business.

625
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:44,169
Yes. They're probably experts
at building things...

626
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,479
...whereas I'm an expert
at blowing them up.

627
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:49,163
Take it from me that
one would need eight hours...

628
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:51,365
...to make a decent job
of that bridge.

629
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:52,678
Eight hours?

630
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:56,888
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are
kind enough to leave us in peace.

631
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,199
And maybe provide
a few working lights.

632
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:02,569
You've seen those searchlights,
have you? Well, l...

633
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,560
- Miller.
- Sir.

634
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:07,323
I think you've made
your technical point.

635
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:09,320
Many thanks, sir.

636
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:14,600
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.

637
01:09:15,209 --> 01:09:18,326
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.

638
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:29,602
What would happen to the bridge
if that central arch...

639
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:33,557
...was suddenly hit
by several million tons of water?

640
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:35,401
- Water?
- Water?

641
01:09:35,889 --> 01:09:38,449
I think we've been talking
about the wrong target.

642
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:41,004
Remember that dam we passed
up around the bend?

643
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:42,921
What kind of a dam?
Where is it?

644
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:44,847
Two and a half miles
up the river.

645
01:09:45,009 --> 01:09:47,398
But, my dear chap,
why didn't you say so before?

646
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:50,879
Oh, I could do a tremendous job
on a dam, yes.

647
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:53,847
With a dam you've got natural
elements working for you.

648
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:57,479
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.

649
01:09:58,369 --> 01:10:00,325
Thank you.

650
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,440
Come along, gentlemen.

651
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:09,484
As a technician, I thought you might
be interested in that dam, Milly.

652
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:12,038
Get them outside
for the dropping zone.

653
01:10:17,329 --> 01:10:20,207
So the RAF drops the stuff
and we blow the dam, right?

654
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:21,484
Right.

655
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:25,324
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.

656
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:27,400
Wouldn't know, old boy.

657
01:10:29,889 --> 01:10:33,199
How often have you used this
as a dropping zone?

658
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:35,163
Never.

659
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:37,638
The Germans see to that.

660
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,369
We have to keep moving around.

661
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,281
Makes sense.

662
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:46,847
You think those two guys know
anything about blowing a dam?

663
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:49,569
Oh, no, I shouldn't think
they've got a clue.

664
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:51,641
But never mind, old Weaver...

665
01:10:51,809 --> 01:10:56,041
...we sergeants will see them through
as usual.

666
01:10:57,969 --> 01:11:00,608
- Right.
- Hello.

667
01:11:02,129 --> 01:11:04,518
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.

668
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:06,202
Come on in, take a seat.

669
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:09,327
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.

670
01:11:09,489 --> 01:11:12,879
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.

671
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:15,085
No. I've seen too many airdrops.

672
01:11:15,249 --> 01:11:17,922
They don't compare
to a nice, warm bed.

673
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:39,563
Would you believe it?
Right on time.

674
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:13,800
I don't believe it.

675
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:16,119
Poor bastards.

676
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:20,644
This was no accident.

677
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:26,364
We've lost our last chance.

678
01:15:08,809 --> 01:15:11,403
There is no question.
We were betrayed.

679
01:15:11,569 --> 01:15:14,447
Aren't we always
with Allied missions?

680
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:16,486
Their security's a joke.

681
01:15:16,649 --> 01:15:18,321
It doesn't matter.

682
01:15:18,489 --> 01:15:20,798
We do our part,
and what do we get?

683
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:23,001
Twenty lives lost.

684
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:25,884
- One of them...
- It's past.

685
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:28,683
Finished.

686
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:34,278
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshalling their tanks.

687
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:36,565
They will cross the bridge
tomorrow...

688
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:39,721
...and there is nothing
we can do to stop them.

689
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:44,966
And you four gentlemen have
outstayed your usefulness.

690
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:49,282
You will be escorted back
to the Allied military mission.

691
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:50,848
Out of harm's way?

692
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:54,762
Sir...

693
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:59,006
...I could leave the Germans
some very nasty surprises.

694
01:15:59,409 --> 01:16:01,604
Thank you, sergeant.

695
01:16:02,169 --> 01:16:05,161
I think we have had
enough surprises.

696
01:16:06,489 --> 01:16:11,609
Capt. Lescovar, see that these
gentlemen have an escort of two men.

697
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:29,241
If those chaps had just half
the equipment of the Jerries...

698
01:16:29,409 --> 01:16:32,048
...I could've made that dam
look like a Swiss cheese.

699
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:34,200
It's absolutely sickening.

700
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:38,078
Do you think the Jerries will have that
gear we need in their supply dump?

701
01:16:38,249 --> 01:16:39,364
Of course they would.

702
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:43,727
Lashings of HE, land mines,
detonators, everything.

703
01:16:43,889 --> 01:16:45,800
It's an absolute certainty.

704
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,607
Your escort, colonel.

705
01:16:48,929 --> 01:16:51,887
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.

706
01:16:52,049 --> 01:16:55,405
I think we're going to need
rather more men than this, captain.

707
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:59,039
My sergeant thinks that the Germans
have the necessary equipment...

708
01:16:59,209 --> 01:17:03,566
...in their forward supply dump
so that the colonel can blow the dam.

709
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:09,244
That means you'd have to get
into the marshalling yards at Mostar.

710
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:13,401
None of you speak enough German.

711
01:17:16,889 --> 01:17:18,368
You need me to help.

712
01:17:19,489 --> 01:17:21,161
Thank you, captain.

713
01:18:21,809 --> 01:18:25,643
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?

714
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:39,684
You look real beautiful,
you know that?

715
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,841
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.

716
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:45,844
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?

717
01:18:46,009 --> 01:18:49,763
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.

718
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,887
Pity they didn't teach you German
at that school of yours.

719
01:19:31,049 --> 01:19:34,121
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.

720
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,520
These any use to you?

721
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:45,407
No, tellermines is what we want.

722
01:19:45,569 --> 01:19:48,481
They look like dirty
grey-green dinner plates.

723
01:19:49,569 --> 01:19:51,924
Maybe they just haven't got any.

724
01:19:53,409 --> 01:19:55,161
They have.

725
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:03,480
I wonder what happened
to Barnsby and his truck.

726
01:21:03,649 --> 01:21:06,527
I've been asking myself
the same question.

727
01:21:06,689 --> 01:21:09,920
Well, we can't just stand here
like ducks in thunder.

728
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:15,163
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.

729
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:43,723
Barnsby should have been here
by now. Where the hell is he?

730
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:46,207
Beautiful.

731
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:49,766
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.

732
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:52,682
Well, I'd rather do it now
than in some ditch.

733
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:54,726
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...

734
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:56,288
...given peace and quiet.

735
01:21:56,449 --> 01:21:59,247
These little sods
can be temperamental.

736
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:03,322
The gubbins itself is harmless enough
but aren't we all, until detonated.

737
01:22:38,929 --> 01:22:40,681
For a moment
I thought we were off.

738
01:22:43,329 --> 01:22:46,082
Hey, where in the hell
have they gotten to?

739
01:22:48,769 --> 01:22:50,487
You maniac.

740
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:52,799
What the hell are you doing here?

741
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:56,803
I'll go and have a look around,
see if I can find them.

742
01:23:19,649 --> 01:23:22,561
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.

743
01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:30,328
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.

744
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:32,047
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...

745
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:34,049
...but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

746
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:34,765
...but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

747
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:51,082
Bloody hell.

748
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:53,445
What's up now?

749
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:57,158
Some great ape of a sergeant,
he's sent Barnsby's truck away.

750
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,444
Oh, no.

751
01:24:00,809 --> 01:24:02,401
Sergeant.

752
01:24:03,889 --> 01:24:05,959
Be quiet. Listen to me.

753
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:10,124
There are two British commanders
in that cattle truck behind me.

754
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:15,724
I'm Col. Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field Intelligence Group.

755
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:19,244
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.

756
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:23,240
There is a third,
an American colonel...

757
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:25,969
...in the truck which you
just sent away.

758
01:24:26,129 --> 01:24:27,801
I want to take them all together.

759
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:31,724
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.

760
01:24:33,489 --> 01:24:37,687
Go and assemble a squad
of armed men. Quickly and quietly.

761
01:24:37,849 --> 01:24:39,407
And keep them out of sight.

762
01:24:39,849 --> 01:24:42,488
Then report back to me.
Understand?

763
01:24:49,729 --> 01:24:53,927
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.

764
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:22,608
All right, you guys, let's...

765
01:25:22,769 --> 01:25:24,361
Oh, man.

766
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,365
The sacks, get them up here quick.

767
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:30,965
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?

768
01:25:31,129 --> 01:25:34,917
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.

769
01:25:38,249 --> 01:25:41,002
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.

770
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,888
Help me get this stuff loaded
and get it on the truck.

771
01:26:06,849 --> 01:26:08,601
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.

772
01:26:08,769 --> 01:26:11,488
Let's go. Easy.

773
01:26:12,529 --> 01:26:14,167
Hold it.

774
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:17,079
It's that man again.

775
01:26:17,409 --> 01:26:20,162
I'll take care of him. Close the door.

776
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:33,322
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.

777
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:46,640
All clear?

778
01:26:46,809 --> 01:26:49,448
Give them a moment
to get out of sight.

779
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:02,205
That fool, Marko,
must have given himself away.

780
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:03,927
I don't know how.

781
01:28:04,089 --> 01:28:06,842
How in the hell are we gonna
get back across the river?

782
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:08,522
I mean, where are we going?

783
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:11,044
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.

784
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:14,800
Sarajevo.

785
01:28:16,009 --> 01:28:18,569
That's where the train goes.

786
01:28:19,249 --> 01:28:20,887
No stops.

787
01:29:03,889 --> 01:29:05,083
I'm sorry about Marko.

788
01:29:08,249 --> 01:29:09,648
Thank you.

789
01:29:10,769 --> 01:29:12,839
It's a risk we all take.

790
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:18,278
He was a brave man
and a good friend.

791
01:29:19,489 --> 01:29:21,525
Pity he got careless.

792
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:25,287
Do you think that big sergeant
spotted him as a Partisan?

793
01:29:27,049 --> 01:29:29,005
I can't buy that.

794
01:29:29,569 --> 01:29:32,163
The sergeant wasn't that bright.

795
01:29:34,809 --> 01:29:38,324
He saluted you,
you're wearing a corporal's uniform.

796
01:29:39,009 --> 01:29:41,477
That doesn't rate a salute
in the German army.

797
01:29:41,969 --> 01:29:44,199
Not in anybody's army.

798
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:48,684
Why do you think
he saluted you, Lescovar?

799
01:29:54,609 --> 01:29:58,727
Perhaps he recognized
my natural superiority.

800
01:29:59,129 --> 01:30:01,006
Yes, perhaps.

801
01:30:08,969 --> 01:30:12,678
You say this train goes
to Sarajevo, no stops?

802
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:15,128
Yeah.

803
01:30:16,569 --> 01:30:21,279
But I noticed on the map that we pass
within a half a mile of the dam.

804
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:24,966
Strange you didn't bother
to mention that.

805
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:37,164
Now, what's all this about?

806
01:30:38,129 --> 01:30:40,006
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...

807
01:30:40,169 --> 01:30:43,002
...and I forget to mention
that we pass near the dam.

808
01:30:45,049 --> 01:30:50,487
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.

809
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:53,883
I don't think he gave anything away...

810
01:30:54,169 --> 01:30:56,000
...except his life.

811
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,563
What did you give away, Lescovar?

812
01:31:19,249 --> 01:31:21,968
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?

813
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:26,039
I don't think, I know.

814
01:31:26,369 --> 01:31:28,325
I've always known.

815
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:30,525
I just couldn't prove it.

816
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:34,761
You're Nicolai.

817
01:31:34,929 --> 01:31:37,159
You're the man who
blew us in Greece.

818
01:32:03,009 --> 01:32:04,965
Thank you, colonel.

819
01:32:09,329 --> 01:32:11,399
I've done your job.

820
01:32:12,489 --> 01:32:14,639
You help me do mine.

821
01:32:57,649 --> 01:32:58,843
Oh, crikey.

822
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:02,240
It's lit like a Christmas tree.

823
01:33:07,089 --> 01:33:08,681
Dawn's around 5:30.

824
01:33:09,889 --> 01:33:11,368
Gives us an hour to get in...

825
01:33:11,529 --> 01:33:15,158
...half-hour to set the charges
and 20 minutes to get clear.

826
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:19,880
What you need, sir,
is a little diversion, isn't it?

827
01:36:02,209 --> 01:36:05,758
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.

828
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:08,238
Try and imagine you're a dog.

829
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:12,683
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road!

830
01:36:45,089 --> 01:36:46,761
Hallelujah!

831
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:27,528
Just unroll it and string it out.

832
01:39:16,609 --> 01:39:18,520
Come on, blackie.

833
01:39:21,609 --> 01:39:23,361
Come on, blackie.

834
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:26,122
Come on.

835
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:39,963
Hey. You bleed red blood,
eh, blackie?

836
01:42:26,729 --> 01:42:27,957
Here.

837
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:29,968
Right here.

838
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:17,558
You all right?

839
01:43:55,289 --> 01:43:58,201
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!

840
01:43:58,369 --> 01:44:01,327
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.

841
01:44:01,489 --> 01:44:04,526
If they'd been caught,
we'd have heard the alarm go off.

842
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:39,405
How long do we make the fuse?

843
01:45:39,809 --> 01:45:43,085
They're Germans,
they're gonna be punctual.

844
01:45:43,249 --> 01:45:45,160
Usually are.

845
01:45:52,689 --> 01:45:54,441
We've run out of time.

846
01:46:00,209 --> 01:46:01,608
Twenty seconds?

847
01:46:02,009 --> 01:46:03,522
What do you say?

848
01:46:03,769 --> 01:46:06,078
It's your decision, colonel.

849
01:46:09,769 --> 01:46:11,680
I'm asking you.

850
01:46:13,969 --> 01:46:18,406
Twenty seconds sounds about right,
then we won't have so far to run.

851
01:46:29,329 --> 01:46:31,968
It would have been nice
to see that bridge go, huh?

852
01:46:32,129 --> 01:46:33,881
Yes, wouldn't it?

853
01:46:36,329 --> 01:46:40,083
All been very interesting,
though, hasn't it?

854
01:46:41,209 --> 01:46:42,198
Yes.

855
01:47:05,369 --> 01:47:09,157
It didn't do a goddamn thing! Nothing!

856
01:48:26,609 --> 01:48:30,761
Miller! That useless git!

857
01:48:30,929 --> 01:48:33,159
- It didn't...
- What?

858
01:48:33,329 --> 01:48:37,322
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!

859
01:48:37,489 --> 01:48:40,401
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

860
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:44,323
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!

861
01:48:48,369 --> 01:48:49,961
Nothing!

862
01:48:50,129 --> 01:48:52,279
We've been through
all this, and nothing!

863
01:48:52,449 --> 01:48:54,246
Nothing but:

864
01:48:54,609 --> 01:48:59,399
You can't expect an enormous volcano
with three tiny bags of explosives.

865
01:49:00,409 --> 01:49:03,048
You have to let nature take her course.

866
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:05,485
Give it time, it'll work.

867
01:49:43,729 --> 01:49:46,562
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!

868
01:51:55,569 --> 01:51:59,084
- You son of a bitch!
- I told you, it's only a matter of waiting.

869
01:52:05,729 --> 01:52:10,200
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.

870
01:52:10,369 --> 01:52:14,248
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a... You did it!

871
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:17,329
Why, you limey genius, I love you!

872
01:52:17,489 --> 01:52:19,127
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.

873
01:52:19,289 --> 01:52:21,007
You did it!

874
01:56:37,209 --> 01:56:39,484
Miller, you horrible little man...

875
01:56:39,649 --> 01:56:42,368
...you knew that was gonna be
a slow-motion explosion.

876
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:44,724
You deliberately didn't tell me,
did you?

877
01:56:44,889 --> 01:56:47,323
I didn't want to bore you
with technical detail.

878
01:56:47,489 --> 01:56:49,639
I thought it might be
a bit over your head.

879
01:56:49,809 --> 01:56:51,242
What happened to you?

880
01:56:51,409 --> 01:56:53,206
He bit me in all the excitement.

881
01:56:53,369 --> 01:56:56,327
But damn it to hell, we did it,
colonel, we did it!

882
01:56:56,489 --> 01:56:58,605
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did!

883
01:56:58,769 --> 01:57:00,600
And a merry Christmas.

884
01:57:00,769 --> 01:57:04,523
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.

885
01:57:05,969 --> 01:57:07,038
But before...

886
01:57:07,529 --> 01:57:10,919
...we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...

887
01:57:11,409 --> 01:57:14,287
...and Congressional Medals of Honor
and so on...

888
01:57:14,449 --> 01:57:16,724
...and so forth and such like...

889
01:57:17,049 --> 01:57:21,281
...I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.

890
01:57:22,209 --> 01:57:26,407
That two: We have no hope
whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.

891
01:57:26,689 --> 01:57:28,042
And that three:

892
01:57:28,209 --> 01:57:33,966
This neck of the woods will soon be
crawling with bad-tempered Germans.

893
01:57:34,209 --> 01:57:35,767
And four:

894
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:39,325
I don't think that our little genius,
Sgt. Miller there...

895
01:57:39,489 --> 01:57:42,925
...has even got a box of matches
left in his suitcase.

896
01:57:43,889 --> 01:57:48,485
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...

897
01:57:48,729 --> 01:57:53,007
...that we are going to have
a very long walk home.

898
02:00:45,649 --> 02:00:47,640
