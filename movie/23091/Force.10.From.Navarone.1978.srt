1
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:22,504
Deep in the heart of the Aegean
lies the island of Navarone.

2
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:27,007
In 1943, it stood lik e a thorn
in the Allied side.

3
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:32,263
Newly designed radar-controlled guns
set in the heart of the ancient rock...

4
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:36,684
...gave the German High Command
total strategic dominance.

5
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,687
Air strik es and naval attacks
had proven costly and ineffective.

6
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:45,860
In desperation, the Allies turned
to infiltration.

7
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:50,113
On the night of September the 24th, a
specially trained commando group...

8
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:54,118
...succeeded in penetrating
the very heart of the gun complex...

9
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,040
...planted explosives at the base
of the giant shell hoists...

10
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:02,956
...then withdrew to await rescue
by ships of the Royal Navy.

11
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:11,922
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 reps.

12
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,898
Fire!

13
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,594
Move! Move!

14
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,262
Come on, move it!

15
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,345
Move it!

16
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:20,387
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

17
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:25,476
Regulations state, sir, that in the
absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...

18
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:28,737
...the acting catering officer,
that's you, sir...

19
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:32,488
...shall authorize once per week,
the issue of offal.

20
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,070
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...

21
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:36,914
...is kidneys, liver,
tongue, brains...

22
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:39,038
Well, I'll be damned!

23
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,496
- Milly, how nice to see you!
- Hello, sir.

24
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:44,241
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.

25
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:46,247
I'm reporting to Cmdr. Jensen.

26
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:50,372
I gather you've been hurling yourself
over the white cliffs. How's the leg?

27
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:54,050
It's in the same place. I thought
they pensioned you off for good.

28
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,546
You still peddling
those whiz-bangs of yours?

29
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:59,510
Yes, we've got things that go boom
for all occasions.

30
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:02,602
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting...

31
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,440
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Cmdr. Jensen waiting.

32
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:09,770
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, together.

33
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,237
Corporal, put that in my office,
will you?

34
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,198
Mallory.

35
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,124
Take a pew. How's the leg?

36
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,285
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,952
Hear you've been attached
to Winston's toy shop.

38
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,296
"Department of Dirty Tricks"
as the Whitehall chaps call it.

39
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,624
Well, they speak very well of you.

40
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:40,712
Right. We need you chaps
for something rather special.

41
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:47,643
I'm afraid it's not exactly
a masterpiece...

42
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:50,981
...but I wonder if you can identify
this fellow.

43
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:57,814
Think back to Navarone.

44
00:05:58,698 --> 00:05:59,978
I'd rather not, sir.

45
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,735
Nicolai?

46
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:07,152
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?

47
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,826
But what about him?

48
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,916
Andrea's people had him shot
as a traitor, didn't they?

49
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,663
Yes, so we were told.

50
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,117
In fact, he escaped.

51
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:17,834
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...

52
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,839
...who we believe is operating now
in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...

53
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,336
...posing as one Capt. Lescovar.

54
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,472
Now, you both knew Nicolai.

55
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,266
In fact, you're the only people we know
of can make a positive identification.

56
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:34,187
So I'd like you to go out there
and cope.

57
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,597
Cope, sir?

58
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,519
Kill him.

59
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,982
Discreetly, if possible.

60
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:43,609
But I'm a civilian now, sir.

61
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:45,192
Yes, we thought about that.

62
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:48,071
So you've been recalled
to the current and promoted.

63
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:49,786
Staff sergeant.

64
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,364
Awfully generous, sir.

65
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:53,661
Exactly how do we get there?

66
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,789
We're tacking you onto Force 10.

67
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,541
The code name for an operation
for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.

68
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,797
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?

69
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,539
It's being treated
on a need-to-know basis.

70
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,178
And you don't need to know.

71
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:07,878
And you don't need to know.

72
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,796
Barnsby, come in.

73
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,219
- Sir?
- Colonel.

74
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,398
Force 10 flies out tonight.

75
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,521
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,149
I beg your pardon, sir?

77
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,239
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.

78
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,077
Just a sideshow.
This is Maj. Mallory, Sgt. Miller.

79
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,070
Lt. Col. Barnsby.

80
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:40,243
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been
planned down to the last detail.

81
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,999
The last thing we need are
a couple of passengers.

82
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,254
Maj. Mallory does have a certain
amount of experience.

83
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,751
I wouldn't doubt it.

84
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:51,594
We're talking about
some hard travelling, sir.

85
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:55,212
We've gotta move fast. My men
are young, in top physical shape.

86
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:59,513
- They're specially trained for this.
- I'm aware of that.

87
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:03,434
Sir, I am concerned about the safety
of my command.

88
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,178
Well, these chaps have got
a job to do as well.

89
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:09,441
And it's up to you to deliver them
safely to the Partisans.

90
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,935
And you leave for Italy
at 2300 hours...

91
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:15,030
...and you take off for Yugoslavia
the following night.

92
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,156
Very well, sir.

93
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:20,031
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.

94
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:26,199
Well, we'll do our best not to make
a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.

95
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,721
All right, enough!

96
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:04,490
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...

97
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:10,285
...we might be going to Yugoslavia
by walking on water.

98
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:19,755
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.

99
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,754
Stop it.

100
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:27,262
Nolan, kill the lights.
All right, out.

101
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,508
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.

102
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:47,947
You're gonna miss your plane
unless you join us now, major.

103
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,125
Remarkable way of getting
on an aircraft, don't you think so?

104
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,371
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?

105
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:04,295
It's not easy if you insist on climbing
through fences in the dark...

106
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:08,381
...when there's a perfectly good gate
half a mile up the road.

107
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,679
Anything we can do to help?

108
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:13,682
Yeah, you can keep quiet
and out of the way, major.

109
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,724
I don't have a lot of time
for explanations.

110
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,644
One thing that you don't know...

111
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:27,689
...is the last three Allied missions
into Yugoslavia...

112
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:29,986
...were blown right here in Italy.

113
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:37,031
So this time when we fly out, we're
not advertising the fact to anybody.

114
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:03,010
Holy cow, will you look
at those guys!

115
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,263
They're stealing half the field.

116
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,100
All right, hold it.

117
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,734
Wait for me.

118
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:13,197
Okay, men, let's go!

119
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,699
- Blake, take care of Rastus there.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,944
Okay, fellas, freeze.

121
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,614
Back off. Come on, get back.

122
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,745
And you, back, back!

123
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:27,450
Bill, Eddie, fetch those other guys
out of there.

124
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:04,988
What's your name, kid?

125
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,822
Walter.

126
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,746
What's yours?

127
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,589
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.

128
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,750
Walter.

129
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:36,178
Good evening.

130
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,521
Major, move!

131
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:47,150
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.

132
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:49,449
We're very much obliged to you,
sergeant.

133
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,529
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sgt. Weaver. Thank you.

134
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,698
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

135
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,950
- But, sir!
- All set, colonel.

136
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,035
- Still stuff outside?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,168
- Okay, Oberstein?
- Fine.

138
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,711
Hey, sir!

139
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,800
Where's Nolan?

140
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:15,140
I think you can take it
he won't be joining us.

141
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,141
Okay, let's go.

142
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:27,737
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...

143
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,233
...and you run out on me.

144
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,399
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.

145
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,695
Hey, man, don't push!
Don't push me!

146
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,986
- Look, you!
- I think it's a bit late for that now.

147
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:12,521
Look, you just shouldn't have
left me there. I saved you bums.

148
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:15,614
Well, we didn't think you'd like
where we're going.

149
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,905
You let me worry about that, huh?

150
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,860
That guy's gonna melt
into the landscape.

151
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:24,905
Yeah, them Partisans are gonna think
they've been invaded by Zulus.

152
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,785
Well, you are one man short.

153
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:31,294
Well, Nolan can handle a chute,
at least.

154
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:36,465
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.

155
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,470
That's right, you learn
on the way down.

156
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:43,722
I'd better go tell the colonel
we got us another passenger.

157
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:48,305
I think the colonel's got enough on
his plate for the moment, don't you?

158
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,241
So sorry.

159
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,077
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.

160
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,793
You never know.
It might come in useful.

161
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,348
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?

162
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:28,010
My pyjamas.

163
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,674
Looks like high-explosive pyjamas
to me.

164
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,132
Not to worry, old boy.

165
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:36,855
Been handling this since I blew up
the nursery with my first chemistry set.

166
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,315
Poor old nanny.

167
00:15:58,628 --> 00:15:59,872
We got company.

168
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,044
Cut two!

169
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,683
Reynolds, bail out!

170
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:08,937
Jump!

171
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,568
Go!

172
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,108
Come on, move it!

173
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,949
Come on, get out!

174
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,944
Come on, move!

175
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,998
Come on!

176
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,465
Mallory.

177
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:16,136
Okay.

178
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:19,976
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down!

179
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,817
Come on.

180
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,352
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.

181
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,935
Where's your Sgt. Miller?

182
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,290
How the hell did he get here?

183
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:59,124
You let him on the plane?

184
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,213
I think he more or less
invited himself.

185
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,345
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.

186
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:22,931
You don't call him man.
You call him sir, and you call me sir.

187
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:27,153
And as long as you're here, you do
as you're told. Understood, soldier?

188
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,069
Yes, sir.

189
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:41,414
We've gotta get out of here
before that patrol comes back.

190
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:44,538
Lt. Reynolds, take point.
Sgt. Weaver, bring up the rear.

191
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:47,915
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.

192
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:51,381
Organized young gentleman,
isn't he?

193
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,537
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.

194
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:32,832
If we keep going east, we'll
end up where we're supposed to.

195
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,545
How did we get stuck
with those two clowns?

196
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:39,797
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.

197
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:43,138
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.

198
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:46,475
Do you think that young man has
any idea where we are, Milly?

199
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:50,393
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.

200
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:53,483
I'll go and try and find out.

201
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:56,320
Yes, why don't you do that.

202
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:00,063
Excuse me, colonel.

203
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:02,483
Do you have any idea
where we are?

204
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,486
I've got a good idea where we are.

205
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:08,326
And how long it's gonna take to get
there, if you two can't keep up.

206
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:11,995
All right, let's move it.

207
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:30,757
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvellous.

208
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,687
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.

209
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,108
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.

210
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,687
Yes.

211
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,774
I've often thought that I'd rather like
to settle down there some day.

212
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,109
Looks like you're gonna have
to change your plans.

213
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,789
Take it easy.

214
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:12,046
Welcome.

215
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:14,465
Capt. Drazak.

216
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,180
Seventeenth Partisan Regiment.

217
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:19,974
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!

218
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,720
Thank you, Capt. Drazak.

219
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:25,558
They frightened you with bandages,
huh?

220
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:28,062
Without bandages you...

221
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,075
German, how you say:

222
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:34,034
You say, "flamethrower."

223
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:36,574
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.

224
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:39,164
Hello! Hello!

225
00:25:39,332 --> 00:25:41,159
How do you do?

226
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,583
This is Maritza,
good soldier comrade.

227
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,006
How do you do,
good soldier comrade?

228
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,836
Hello, blackie.

229
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,196
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.

230
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:30,454
Back off, soldier.

231
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,964
I make big joke...

232
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:45,810
...but joke on me.

233
00:26:56,737 --> 00:27:00,734
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.

234
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:04,324
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.

235
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:05,823
Come.

236
00:27:05,996 --> 00:27:08,403
Come, we go.

237
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:18,746
Where did you learn to punch
like that? Harvard?

238
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:21,841
No, Harlem. Colonel?

239
00:27:22,344 --> 00:27:25,262
I'm not trying to get anybody
killed, least of all me.

240
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:29,760
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.

241
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,531
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.

242
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:49,530
Good, good. Well, it looks like
things may work out after all, huh?

243
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:53,368
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still
carry out our little sideshow.

244
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,367
Sorry about Force 10.

245
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:58,033
You're down to two men, aren't you?

246
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:00,702
Of course, I don't know
what your mission was...

247
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,376
...but obviously it just isn't
on now, is it, colonel?

248
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:43,000
Looks rather like your own youngster,
doesn't he?

249
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,913
Do you really think so?

250
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:58,090
Please, come.

251
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,757
Come, eat.

252
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,690
We are Chetniks...

253
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:18,107
...not stinking Partisans.

254
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:30,625
We hunt Allied commandos
like wild pigs!

255
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:33,466
We work with Germans.
They are our friends!

256
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,134
Good evening, gentlemen.

257
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:45,715
Maj. Schroeder, 11 th army corps.

258
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:48,431
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.

259
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:50,644
We thought these people were
Partisans.

260
00:29:50,814 --> 00:29:53,733
- Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
- Sure.

261
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:56,986
Chetniks? Who would have
believed that?

262
00:29:57,154 --> 00:30:00,488
The other three Allied missions
that fell into our hands...

263
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,992
...were not quite so happy about it
as you appear to be.

264
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:06,071
I'm not surprised, sir.

265
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:10,409
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.

266
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,412
Deserters?

267
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:17,204
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.

268
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,624
You see, we were
in a prison camp in Termoli.

269
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:22,833
We escaped.

270
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:26,131
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.

271
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:31,181
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and
landed in your territory, thank God.

272
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,679
Fascinating.

273
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:38,763
Tell me, why exactly
did you desert?

274
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,102
Now, I'm glad you asked that.

275
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,106
Yes.

276
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:46,945
Well, I am afraid
that is rather a long story.

277
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:51,115
Oh, please, you must not
be afraid of boring me.

278
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:55,369
Have you ever heard of penicillin?

279
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,871
No.

280
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:00,834
Well, I'm not surprised.
It's new.

281
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:03,922
It's a drug that prevents wounds
from becoming infected.

282
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:06,714
It cures a whole range of infections...

283
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:09,886
...including some of the nastier
social diseases.

284
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:14,302
It's become one of the most
sought-after items on the black market.

285
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:17,891
Our friend here, Sgt. Weaver
of the American Medical Corps...

286
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:20,470
...was our supplier.

287
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:28,479
You are saying you stole these drugs
from the Army to sell to civilians?

288
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:34,568
Not just to civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.

289
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,943
Any army.

290
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:38,616
I see.

291
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:45,039
Tell me, what has all this to do
with that suitcase you keep looking at?

292
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:47,917
Well, that suitcase
is full of our penicillin.

293
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:51,252
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?

294
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:53,086
Certainly, major.

295
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:54,840
Open it, Miller.

296
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:59,047
You can't do that here,
you'd ruin the lot.

297
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:02,559
You know perfectly well that
any contamination will destroy it.

298
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:04,935
It must be opened
under laboratory conditions.

299
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:08,060
There's nearly half a million
pounds worth of stuff here.

300
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:11,685
I know all that, but the major
is not interested in our penicillin.

301
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,735
He only wants to know the truth.

302
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:17,239
What's the use of a half a million
pounds to you out here?

303
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:22,949
Yes, well, that's beside the point,
sir, but I'm not going to open it.

304
00:32:27,502 --> 00:32:29,827
Our story doesn't seem
to convince you.

305
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:32,080
No, it does not.

306
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,257
That's up to you, but every word
he's told you is true.

307
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:38,545
If you don't believe it,
check with your intelligence.

308
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,594
They'll verify the entire story.

309
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:44,465
Oh, I shall certainly verify
your story.

310
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:47,351
Every word of it.

311
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:50,013
Get in!

312
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:02,867
Cute story, major, very cute.

313
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:06,238
Now, what happens
when they open the suitcase?

314
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:10,113
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?

315
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,955
Headquarters acknowledges
your signal.

316
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:18,958
Thank you, Bauer.

317
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,187
Maritza...

318
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,865
...what do you think?

319
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,159
They're lying.

320
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,654
What does it matter, anyway?

321
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:55,953
Kill them.

322
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,826
Yeah, you are probably right.

323
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,332
Do you know what I was thinking?

324
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:06,916
After the war, $1 million.

325
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:10,427
You, a simple peasant girl
from where?

326
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:13,966
I can never pronounce the name
of the place you come from.

327
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,361
With so much money, we could...

328
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:27,939
They're lying.

329
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:29,940
Kill them.

330
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,625
Out! Get out.

331
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,579
What did I tell you?

332
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,755
Well, at least we got
a good night's sleep.

333
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,224
Good morning, gentlemen.

334
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,685
Our intelligence confirms
your escape from Italy.

335
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,437
You and you, follow me, please.

336
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:12,833
Your escape from Italy
is one thing.

337
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:16,040
The rest of your story
is something else.

338
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,665
I had time to sleep on it.

339
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:23,292
So this morning,
you know what I did?

340
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:27,466
I opened the suitcase.

341
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:30,132
Maritza!

342
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:38,473
And what do you think I found?

343
00:36:41,904 --> 00:36:43,647
Firewood.

344
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:50,490
What did you expect? We buried it
before your Chetniks picked us up.

345
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:53,995
We're not stupid. It's the only thing
we've got to bargain with.

346
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:57,997
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.

347
00:36:58,169 --> 00:37:01,584
You know they're lying. Why don't
you let Drazak get rid of them?

348
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,463
Gently, Maritza.

349
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:07,214
I don't believe your so-called penicillin
exists, but it just might.

350
00:37:07,385 --> 00:37:10,172
So I will let you go
and dig it up for me.

351
00:37:11,097 --> 00:37:16,009
And if we do, you'll shoot us
and bury us in the same hole.

352
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,724
I shall certainly shoot you
if you don't.

353
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:23,681
Well, gentlemen,
the choice is yours.

354
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:57,429
What I can't figure is how
the firewood got in the case.

355
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,591
Neither can I.

356
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:04,097
Don't know where we're going to find
any spare penicillin here, do you?

357
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:07,890
What are we going to do, keep
walking until we reach the Adriatic?

358
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,937
I don't think the iron maiden
will let us get that far.

359
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:12,736
Halt!

360
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:17,151
What did I tell you?

361
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:20,528
We are three miles past the spot
where you were picked up.

362
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:23,870
Well, where is this
wonderful treasure?

363
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,329
In your imagination?

364
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:28,908
No, ma'am,
it's not in our imagination.

365
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,412
I think it's a bit further on,
don't you?

366
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,874
Yes, it is. Well, I mean,
it's not much further than this.

367
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,588
It's hard to tell,
the whole country looks alike.

368
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:40,299
You will start digging
within five minutes.

369
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:44,470
What if we haven't found it
in five minutes?

370
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:47,763
Then you will be digging
your graves.

371
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:13,999
Hey, colonel.

372
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:16,163
Wait a minute,
now this looks familiar.

373
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,174
Isn't this our little hollow
down here?

374
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:22,259
Yes, I think it is.

375
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,003
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.

376
00:39:27,182 --> 00:39:28,890
I think this is it.

377
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:30,718
- This knoll over here?
- Right.

378
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:34,476
You see, comrade, we lined it up
between them...

379
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:39,224
There you are!
There's our pile of stones.

380
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,243
Gotta get them closer
and we use the spades.

381
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:55,785
You take the two
that are closest to you...

382
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:59,042
...and I'll take the other one
and the broad.

383
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:16,974
I'm gonna get them
closer now, okay?

384
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:26,351
Fritz. Fritz, come!
It's here.

385
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:32,200
- Ready?
- All right.

386
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,251
You can get up now.
They're dead.

387
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:54,550
I put firewood in people's cases
and hide their high explosives.

388
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,216
Don't sit there gawping.

389
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,675
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.

390
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:02,935
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.

391
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:04,931
Now, go.

392
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:07,478
Excuse me,
good comrade soldier...

393
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,896
...but exactly what story are you
gonna tell Schroeder about all this?

394
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,937
You took us by surprise.

395
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:17,025
You got away.

396
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:19,779
Here, hit me.

397
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:24,492
Did you expect me to go back there
with my hair combed?

398
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,697
Hit me!

399
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:30,042
Well, all right. I'm sorry.

400
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:34,254
Harder!

401
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:37,133
Come on, colonel.

402
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,328
I hope that man Schroeder
believes that girl's story.

403
00:42:11,584 --> 00:42:15,628
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better
think twice about calling her a liar.

404
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:22,380
What about Miller and Reynolds?

405
00:42:24,512 --> 00:42:27,264
What about them, colonel?

406
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:33,096
Yes.

407
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,847
I suppose they...

408
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,816
Let's move it.

409
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:02,828
Do you have the feeling
we're being followed?

410
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:05,544
About the last 10 minutes.

411
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:42,468
Next time you can play the corpse.

412
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:46,226
Yeah, you seem pretty good
with that thing, though.

413
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:48,470
Could have been luck.

414
00:45:37,024 --> 00:45:40,855
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.

415
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,255
Partisans, thank God!

416
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:09,466
Good morning.

417
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:11,680
Good morning.

418
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:30,900
What's the matter with him?
We've been looking for you.

419
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:32,449
Be quiet.

420
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:35,239
You will make your report
to Maj. Petrovitch.

421
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:23,533
I think we've run into
bad company, colonel.

422
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:25,366
Yes, the leader.

423
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,079
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.

424
00:47:28,252 --> 00:47:30,873
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?

425
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,918
It's Nicolai Lescovar.

426
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:37,296
The man I was sent to kill.

427
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:21,040
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.

428
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:23,506
So do I. Right in it.

429
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:28,262
Do you think he's recognized you?

430
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:30,674
Yes, I think so.

431
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,361
Lt. Col. Barnsby,
United States Rangers.

432
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:39,702
Maj. Mallory, sir.

433
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,712
You got away from the Germans.

434
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:53,083
How?

435
00:49:53,762 --> 00:49:55,090
We escaped.

436
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:09,021
Capt. Lescovar
has his doubts about that.

437
00:50:09,526 --> 00:50:12,942
If you escaped, why were
the Germans not pursuing you?

438
00:50:13,988 --> 00:50:16,907
We observed you for five miles
before we picked you up.

439
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:21,120
You should've observed that we killed
two Chetniks that were following us.

440
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:24,822
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.

441
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:29,164
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.

442
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:33,955
Comrades of ours whom we had
infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...

443
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:38,129
...so now all links with our agent there
are broken, thanks to you.

444
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:42,552
I'm sorry.

445
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,054
The fact remains
that we're Allied officers.

446
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:48,800
There's no reason
we should be treated this way.

447
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,016
I'm in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...

448
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:55,809
...to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.

449
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:59,485
We are informed
of many things by London...

450
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,822
...very few of them
ever seem to materialize.

451
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,452
However, you are right.

452
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,532
I was informed of your mission.

453
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:11,121
Personally, I doubt if it was
ever a practical one...

454
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:16,416
...but now that you are here without
equipment, the question is academic.

455
00:51:16,588 --> 00:51:22,424
And you, major, you came here
as an observer, perhaps?

456
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:23,792
No, sir.

457
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,840
I was charged with a mission
of my own.

458
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:28,337
It's confidential.

459
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:31,682
Confidential!

460
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:35,387
Sometimes I get the impression...

461
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:38,351
...that London looks
on this theatre of operations...

462
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:42,523
...as a convenient place for conducting
what they call "war games."

463
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:46,403
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.

464
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,033
- I mean alone.
- No.

465
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:54,405
The People's Army does not conduct
military business in secret.

466
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,701
Very well, sir.

467
00:51:56,876 --> 00:52:01,169
I was sent here to identify a German
agent, code name Nicolai.

468
00:52:02,214 --> 00:52:03,708
We are reliably informed...

469
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:08,093
...that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...

470
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:10,218
...as Capt. Lescovar.

471
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:14,053
And having identified this man,
what were your further orders?

472
00:52:14,725 --> 00:52:16,552
I was to eliminate him, sir.

473
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:22,481
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.

474
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:25,148
Do you hear that, Lescovar?

475
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:28,901
The gentlemen from London
want us to shoot you.

476
00:52:43,002 --> 00:52:45,078
I'm sorry, major.

477
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:48,541
I must admit you are
indeed partly right.

478
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:52,214
There was an agent
named Nicolai...

479
00:52:52,385 --> 00:52:57,213
...operating somewhere south of here
and also calling himself Lescovar.

480
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:02,098
But he was identified many
months ago. And eliminated.

481
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:05,270
The British were informed.

482
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:11,733
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...

483
00:53:11,904 --> 00:53:14,026
...and just as frequently wrong!

484
00:53:14,197 --> 00:53:16,949
Lt. Marko,
see that these gentlemen...

485
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:20,948
...give you a full report on their
activities in the Chetnik camp.

486
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,825
A specific report.

487
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:49,804
Well, captain, I guess we owe you
a bit of an apology, don't we?

488
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,060
Well, it happens. We all
get badly briefed sometimes.

489
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:58,103
Wish we had been briefed
about the men with the bandages.

490
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:01,857
Replaced them with a couple
of your own, that's a good trick.

491
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:05,449
They were messengers to our agent
at Schroeder's headquarters.

492
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,371
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...

493
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:11,326
...beautiful grey eyes
and shoots from the hip?

494
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,169
You mean Maritza?
Yes.

495
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:16,494
She took a big chance for us.

496
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:18,913
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter
for nothing.

497
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,808
We hold this end of the bridge.

498
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,814
Over there, the Germans
prepare for the final attack.

499
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,398
We have been ordered to prevent
them crossing at all costs.

500
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,893
What exactly do they have
over there?

501
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,855
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.

502
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,030
Soon they will bring up tanks, then...

503
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:54,363
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.

504
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,864
Each time we lost valuable men.

505
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:01,792
Maj. Petrovitch has decided
it is impractical.

506
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,457
Well, he's wrong about that.

507
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:06,716
There's no bridge in the world
that can't be blown.

508
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:09,720
That's what Force 10
was here to prove.

509
00:55:20,397 --> 00:55:23,433
I told you before, you have no men,
you have no equipment.

510
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:27,357
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.

511
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:31,775
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip
for a plane that may never arrive.

512
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:34,239
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.

513
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:36,818
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.

514
00:55:36,996 --> 00:55:41,409
You mean you can blow 20
of my men to hell, for nothing!

515
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:45,038
That bridge is indestructible.

516
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:47,994
Excuse me, sir,
you don't need 20 men.

517
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:49,548
You need Miller.

518
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:52,551
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.

519
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:55,256
He's probably the best in England.

520
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:59,048
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.

521
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:02,261
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.

522
00:56:02,437 --> 00:56:04,809
Not necessarily, major.

523
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:09,181
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation
just to find out, colonel.

524
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,194
I need every single man
I've got here, now!

525
00:56:12,362 --> 00:56:16,442
Sir, we don't need to mount
a full-scale operation.

526
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:18,692
Just give us two men.

527
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:57,193
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.

528
00:56:58,196 --> 00:57:01,647
You reported five prisoners, major.

529
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:08,075
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.

530
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:40,273
Maj. Schroeder is in the armoury,
and I have told you before...

531
00:57:40,444 --> 00:57:44,358
...this area is out of bounds
to you people, except Capt. Drazak.

532
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:48,775
Kindly remove yourselves
immediately...

533
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:53,530
...and if you can read, which I doubt,
take a look at standing orders.

534
00:57:54,415 --> 00:57:56,740
There. You have made me
burn the milk.

535
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,162
So I did.

536
00:57:58,335 --> 00:57:59,829
Let it burn.

537
00:58:46,755 --> 00:58:48,498
Open up.

538
00:58:51,176 --> 00:58:54,426
Prisoners for Maj. Schroeder.

539
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:19,566
You see, my colleague does not
believe you are deserters.

540
00:59:23,706 --> 00:59:26,031
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?

541
00:59:28,961 --> 00:59:31,630
I thought you said these men
had been shot.

542
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,670
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?

543
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:26,836
No!

544
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:33,142
This is not correct.

545
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,828
Quick. Miller!

546
01:01:36,787 --> 01:01:39,076
Bring him. Open it.

547
01:01:57,223 --> 01:01:59,761
- Go.
- Marko.

548
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,608
Partisan bitch!

549
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:21,281
Always so kind to the men
with burns.

550
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:25,363
But they have no burns.

551
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,471
The three Germans
with the prisoners that escaped...

552
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,339
...all shot in the back
with machine pistols.

553
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,970
You killed them.

554
01:03:08,873 --> 01:03:11,161
Good. Give me the hat.

555
01:03:39,943 --> 01:03:41,816
Open. Open up.

556
01:03:44,573 --> 01:03:46,364
Open!

557
01:03:46,992 --> 01:03:48,865
Open!

558
01:04:44,336 --> 01:04:45,878
Milly.

559
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:52,980
Weaver, don't stand there like
an idiot. Let's get this truck moving.

560
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,268
She okay?

561
01:05:59,906 --> 01:06:02,527
Well, we'll drive as carefully
as we can.

562
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,781
Hey, you.
I don't like the way you talk.

563
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:12,326
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.

564
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,787
This truck doesn't move till somebody
tells me what's going on.

565
01:06:15,963 --> 01:06:17,373
Now, look, you...

566
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:19,836
You bigtime officers
have shafted me twice.

567
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:22,925
You tried to dump me in Italy,
ran out on me back there.

568
01:06:23,094 --> 01:06:27,341
You expect me to drive you like some
chauffeur. Nobody tells me anything.

569
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:30,551
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.

570
01:06:30,726 --> 01:06:34,594
Excuse me, but is your trouble
that you want to be part of the team?

571
01:06:34,772 --> 01:06:37,097
I don't want to be a part
of any lousy team.

572
01:06:37,274 --> 01:06:40,061
I just want some equal consideration.

573
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,526
I don't think you'll get
equal consideration...

574
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:48,154
...from those people back there.
Do you?

575
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,943
I don't care if they're
the U.S. Cavalry.

576
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,702
Nobody moves until somebody
tells me what you're planning to do.

577
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:58,123
- We're going to blow up a bridge.
- A bridge?

578
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:00,867
Whose bridge?
Not me, I'm blowing up nothing.

579
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:04,748
We are going to help the Partisans
blow up a bridge...

580
01:07:04,925 --> 01:07:07,629
...and then if we're very lucky,
we can all go home.

581
01:07:08,053 --> 01:07:10,804
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.

582
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:13,641
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.

583
01:07:13,808 --> 01:07:15,883
You didn't give a mother-hunch
about me.

584
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,811
You came back for Miller,
but you didn't come for me?

585
01:07:19,146 --> 01:07:22,348
No, we didn't.

586
01:07:30,156 --> 01:07:32,825
That's the first straight answer
you've given me.

587
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,952
I think the major's
got a point, colonel.

588
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:42,531
They do look kind of mean,
don't they?

589
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:49,169
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
Get in there and drive the truck!

590
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:50,092
All right.

591
01:07:50,092 --> 01:07:51,005
All right.

592
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,228
We'll have to do this another way.

593
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,440
Get away from the truck.

594
01:08:13,488 --> 01:08:14,947
Wait for my signal.

595
01:09:12,209 --> 01:09:14,782
Useful little insect, isn't he?

596
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:20,833
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable showoff.

597
01:09:21,008 --> 01:09:23,713
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.

598
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:29,682
So now it works, huh, sergeant?

599
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:33,471
Well, these babies are
a little temperamental sometimes.

600
01:09:33,646 --> 01:09:35,685
Like me.

601
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:14,597
Lescovar's confirmed my signals
got through to London.

602
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:16,553
Do you like that chap?

603
01:10:16,727 --> 01:10:19,728
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.

604
01:10:19,897 --> 01:10:21,973
I haven't thought anything
about him.

605
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:26,064
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?

606
01:10:29,572 --> 01:10:30,947
All right, sergeant?

607
01:10:31,115 --> 01:10:33,902
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?

608
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:36,781
Well, no, not exactly.

609
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:38,781
In fact, not by a long chalk.

610
01:10:38,956 --> 01:10:41,661
I'd say you're flogging
a dead horse there, old man.

611
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:44,621
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?

612
01:10:44,795 --> 01:10:47,416
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.

613
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:48,668
Oh, yeah?

614
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,588
In that case, you'll have noticed
how it's built into the living rock.

615
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,758
And how those main pilings are not
just concrete, but 20 feet thick.

616
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,389
That's not forgetting...

617
01:10:58,557 --> 01:11:01,641
I told you, London's dropping
the same stuff we had before.

618
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:05,310
Yes, I know what you're getting,
but it's not gonna be enough.

619
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:08,980
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...

620
01:11:09,151 --> 01:11:11,476
...burn the paint work
here and there.

621
01:11:11,653 --> 01:11:15,318
But nothing that would seriously
inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.

622
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:19,534
Our experts have been studying
that bridge, and they say it'll blow.

623
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:21,445
I don't know where you learned...

624
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,740
...but I'm talking about
the best engineers in the business.

625
01:11:24,915 --> 01:11:27,585
Yes. They're probably experts
at building things...

626
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:29,993
...whereas I'm an expert
at blowing them up.

627
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,791
Take it from me that
one would need eight hours...

628
01:11:32,965 --> 01:11:35,087
...to make a decent job
of that bridge.

629
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:36,456
Eight hours?

630
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:40,845
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are
kind enough to leave us in peace.

631
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:43,255
And maybe provide
a few working lights.

632
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,768
You've seen those searchlights,
have you? Well, l...

633
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,844
- Miller.
- Sir.

634
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,725
I think you've made
your technical point.

635
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:53,808
Many thanks, sir.

636
01:11:54,651 --> 01:11:59,313
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.

637
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:03,198
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.

638
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:14,954
What would happen to the bridge
if that central arch...

639
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:19,078
...was suddenly hit
by several million tons of water?

640
01:12:19,258 --> 01:12:21,001
- Water?
- Water?

641
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:24,179
I think we've been talking
about the wrong target.

642
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:26,842
Remember that dam we passed
up around the bend?

643
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:28,841
What kind of a dam?
Where is it?

644
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:30,849
Two and a half miles
up the river.

645
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:33,509
But, my dear chap,
why didn't you say so before?

646
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:37,138
Oh, I could do a tremendous job
on a dam, yes.

647
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:40,232
With a dam you've got natural
elements working for you.

648
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:44,020
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.

649
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,987
Thank you.

650
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,192
Come along, gentlemen.

651
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:56,536
As a technician, I thought you might
be interested in that dam, Milly.

652
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:59,199
Get them outside
for the dropping zone.

653
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:07,717
So the RAF drops the stuff
and we blow the dam, right?

654
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:09,048
Right.

655
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:13,052
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.

656
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:15,216
Wouldn't know, old boy.

657
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:21,262
How often have you used this
as a dropping zone?

658
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:23,310
Never.

659
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,890
The Germans see to that.

660
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,738
We have to keep moving around.

661
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,732
Makes sense.

662
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:35,493
You think those two guys know
anything about blowing a dam?

663
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,330
Oh, no, I shouldn't think
they've got a clue.

664
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,491
But never mind, old Weaver...

665
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:45,078
...we sergeants will see them through
as usual.

666
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:49,840
- Right.
- Hello.

667
01:13:51,425 --> 01:13:53,916
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.

668
01:13:54,094 --> 01:13:55,673
Come on in, take a seat.

669
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:58,931
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.

670
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,634
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.

671
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:04,934
No. I've seen too many airdrops.

672
01:14:05,105 --> 01:14:07,892
They don't compare
to a nice, warm bed.

673
01:14:27,918 --> 01:14:30,456
Would you believe it?
Right on time.

674
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:11,268
I don't believe it.

675
01:17:11,445 --> 01:17:13,686
Poor bastards.

676
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:18,404
This was no accident.

677
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:24,368
We've lost our last chance.

678
01:18:08,622 --> 01:18:11,327
There is no question.
We were betrayed.

679
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Aren't we always
with Allied missions?

680
01:18:14,669 --> 01:18:16,626
Their security's a joke.

681
01:18:16,796 --> 01:18:18,539
It doesn't matter.

682
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:21,122
We do our part,
and what do we get?

683
01:18:21,592 --> 01:18:23,420
Twenty lives lost.

684
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:26,425
- One of them...
- It's past.

685
01:18:28,015 --> 01:18:29,344
Finished.

686
01:18:31,393 --> 01:18:35,177
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshalling their tanks.

687
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:37,561
They will cross the bridge
tomorrow...

688
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:40,852
...and there is nothing
we can do to stop them.

689
01:18:41,694 --> 01:18:46,320
And you four gentlemen have
outstayed your usefulness.

690
01:18:47,867 --> 01:18:50,821
You will be escorted back
to the Allied military mission.

691
01:18:50,995 --> 01:18:52,454
Out of harm's way?

692
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,534
Sir...

693
01:18:57,709 --> 01:19:00,959
...I could leave the Germans
some very nasty surprises.

694
01:19:01,379 --> 01:19:03,668
Thank you, sergeant.

695
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:07,376
I think we have had
enough surprises.

696
01:19:08,761 --> 01:19:14,100
Capt. Lescovar, see that these
gentlemen have an escort of two men.

697
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:32,483
If those chaps had just half
the equipment of the Jerries...

698
01:19:32,658 --> 01:19:35,409
...I could've made that dam
look like a Swiss cheese.

699
01:19:35,577 --> 01:19:37,654
It's absolutely sickening.

700
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:41,697
Do you think the Jerries will have that
gear we need in their supply dump?

701
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,038
Of course they would.

702
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:47,587
Lashings of HE, land mines,
detonators, everything.

703
01:19:47,756 --> 01:19:49,748
It's an absolute certainty.

704
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:52,675
Your escort, colonel.

705
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:56,094
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.

706
01:19:56,263 --> 01:19:59,762
I think we're going to need
rather more men than this, captain.

707
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:03,552
My sergeant thinks that the Germans
have the necessary equipment...

708
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:08,272
...in their forward supply dump
so that the colonel can blow the dam.

709
01:20:10,443 --> 01:20:14,191
That means you'd have to get
into the marshalling yards at Mostar.

710
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:18,526
None of you speak enough German.

711
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:23,704
You need me to help.

712
01:20:24,873 --> 01:20:26,617
Thank you, captain.

713
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:33,847
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?

714
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:48,487
You look real beautiful,
you know that?

715
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:51,779
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.

716
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:54,910
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?

717
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:58,996
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.

718
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:41,873
Pity they didn't teach you German
at that school of yours.

719
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:45,245
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.

720
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:55,045
These any use to you?

721
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:57,012
No, tellermines is what we want.

722
01:22:57,181 --> 01:23:00,217
They look like dirty
grey-green dinner plates.

723
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:03,807
Maybe they just haven't got any.

724
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:07,182
They have.

725
01:24:15,128 --> 01:24:18,413
I wonder what happened
to Barnsby and his truck.

726
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:21,590
I've been asking myself
the same question.

727
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:25,128
Well, we can't just stand here
like ducks in thunder.

728
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,595
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.

729
01:24:56,375 --> 01:25:00,372
Barnsby should have been here
by now. Where the hell is he?

730
01:25:01,171 --> 01:25:02,962
Beautiful.

731
01:25:03,506 --> 01:25:06,673
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.

732
01:25:06,843 --> 01:25:09,713
Well, I'd rather do it now
than in some ditch.

733
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:11,844
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...

734
01:25:12,014 --> 01:25:13,472
...given peace and quiet.

735
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,557
These little sods
can be temperamental.

736
01:25:16,726 --> 01:25:20,807
The gubbins itself is harmless enough
but aren't we all, until detonated.

737
01:25:57,931 --> 01:25:59,758
For a moment
I thought we were off.

738
01:26:02,519 --> 01:26:05,389
Hey, where in the hell
have they gotten to?

739
01:26:08,192 --> 01:26:09,983
You maniac.

740
01:26:10,152 --> 01:26:12,393
What the hell are you doing here?

741
01:26:12,654 --> 01:26:16,568
I'll go and have a look around,
see if I can find them.

742
01:26:40,388 --> 01:26:43,424
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.

743
01:26:50,146 --> 01:26:51,522
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.

744
01:26:51,689 --> 01:26:53,314
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...

745
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:55,401
...but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

746
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:56,147
...but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

747
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,160
Bloody hell.

748
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:15,624
What's up now?

749
01:27:15,795 --> 01:27:19,495
Some great ape of a sergeant,
he's sent Barnsby's truck away.

750
01:27:19,673 --> 01:27:20,836
Oh, no.

751
01:27:23,303 --> 01:27:24,962
Sergeant.

752
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:28,672
Be quiet. Listen to me.

753
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:33,014
There are two British commanders
in that cattle truck behind me.

754
01:27:35,105 --> 01:27:38,853
I'm Col. Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field Intelligence Group.

755
01:27:40,068 --> 01:27:42,523
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.

756
01:27:43,404 --> 01:27:46,690
There is a third,
an American colonel...

757
01:27:46,866 --> 01:27:49,535
...in the truck which you
just sent away.

758
01:27:49,702 --> 01:27:51,445
I want to take them all together.

759
01:27:51,871 --> 01:27:55,535
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.

760
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:01,752
Go and assemble a squad
of armed men. Quickly and quietly.

761
01:28:01,921 --> 01:28:03,546
And keep them out of sight.

762
01:28:04,006 --> 01:28:06,758
Then report back to me.
Understand?

763
01:28:14,308 --> 01:28:18,685
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.

764
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,588
All right, you guys, let's...

765
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,416
Oh, man.

766
01:28:51,425 --> 01:28:53,548
The sacks, get them up here quick.

767
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:57,301
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?

768
01:28:57,472 --> 01:29:01,423
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.

769
01:29:04,897 --> 01:29:07,767
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.

770
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:10,776
Help me get this stuff loaded
and get it on the truck.

771
01:29:34,716 --> 01:29:36,542
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.

772
01:29:36,717 --> 01:29:39,552
Let's go. Easy.

773
01:29:40,638 --> 01:29:42,345
Hold it.

774
01:29:43,223 --> 01:29:45,381
It's that man again.

775
01:29:45,725 --> 01:29:48,597
I'll take care of him. Close the door.

776
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:02,317
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.

777
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:16,203
All clear?

778
01:30:16,379 --> 01:30:19,131
Give them a moment
to get out of sight.

779
01:31:31,574 --> 01:31:34,990
That fool, Marko,
must have given himself away.

780
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:36,785
I don't know how.

781
01:31:36,954 --> 01:31:39,824
How in the hell are we gonna
get back across the river?

782
01:31:39,998 --> 01:31:41,576
I mean, where are we going?

783
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,205
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.

784
01:31:46,212 --> 01:31:48,121
Sarajevo.

785
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:52,051
That's where the train goes.

786
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,468
No stops.

787
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:40,548
I'm sorry about Marko.

788
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:45,308
Thank you.

789
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:48,635
It's a risk we all take.

790
01:32:50,605 --> 01:32:54,305
He was a brave man
and a good friend.

791
01:32:55,568 --> 01:32:57,691
Pity he got careless.

792
01:32:58,529 --> 01:33:01,613
Do you think that big sergeant
spotted him as a Partisan?

793
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:05,490
I can't buy that.

794
01:33:06,078 --> 01:33:08,783
The sergeant wasn't that bright.

795
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:15,206
He saluted you,
you're wearing a corporal's uniform.

796
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,493
That doesn't rate a salute
in the German army.

797
01:33:19,006 --> 01:33:21,331
Not in anybody's army.

798
01:33:23,552 --> 01:33:26,007
Why do you think
he saluted you, Lescovar?

799
01:33:32,186 --> 01:33:36,479
Perhaps he recognized
my natural superiority.

800
01:33:36,898 --> 01:33:38,855
Yes, perhaps.

801
01:33:47,157 --> 01:33:51,024
You say this train goes
to Sarajevo, no stops?

802
01:33:52,203 --> 01:33:53,580
Yeah.

803
01:33:55,082 --> 01:33:59,993
But I noticed on the map that we pass
within a half a mile of the dam.

804
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:03,837
Strange you didn't bother
to mention that.

805
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:16,554
Now, what's all this about?

806
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:19,518
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...

807
01:34:19,688 --> 01:34:22,642
...and I forget to mention
that we pass near the dam.

808
01:34:24,776 --> 01:34:30,446
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.

809
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,986
I don't think he gave anything away...

810
01:34:34,284 --> 01:34:36,193
...except his life.

811
01:34:38,246 --> 01:34:40,951
What did you give away, Lescovar?

812
01:35:00,433 --> 01:35:03,268
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?

813
01:35:03,978 --> 01:35:07,514
I don't think, I know.

814
01:35:07,858 --> 01:35:09,897
I've always known.

815
01:35:10,151 --> 01:35:12,191
I just couldn't prove it.

816
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,607
You're Nicolai.

817
01:35:16,782 --> 01:35:19,107
You're the man who
blew us in Greece.

818
01:35:46,059 --> 01:35:48,098
Thank you, colonel.

819
01:35:52,648 --> 01:35:54,806
I've done your job.

820
01:35:55,944 --> 01:35:58,185
You help me do mine.

821
01:36:43,028 --> 01:36:44,274
Oh, crikey.

822
01:36:45,907 --> 01:36:47,816
It's lit like a Christmas tree.

823
01:36:52,871 --> 01:36:54,531
Dawn's around 5:30.

824
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:57,333
Gives us an hour to get in...

825
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:01,284
...half-hour to set the charges
and 20 minutes to get clear.

826
01:37:02,922 --> 01:37:06,207
What you need, sir,
is a little diversion, isn't it?

827
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:59,157
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.

828
01:39:59,335 --> 01:40:01,743
Try and imagine you're a dog.

829
01:40:02,464 --> 01:40:06,378
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road!

830
01:40:40,165 --> 01:40:41,908
Hallelujah!

831
01:41:21,662 --> 01:41:24,413
Just unroll it and string it out.

832
01:43:18,145 --> 01:43:20,137
Come on, blackie.

833
01:43:23,358 --> 01:43:25,184
Come on, blackie.

834
01:43:26,486 --> 01:43:28,063
Come on.

835
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:42,494
Hey. You bleed red blood,
eh, blackie?

836
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:37,650
Here.

837
01:46:38,372 --> 01:46:39,747
Right here.

838
01:47:28,334 --> 01:47:29,366
You all right?

839
01:48:08,705 --> 01:48:11,742
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!

840
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:15,001
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.

841
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:18,336
If they'd been caught,
we'd have heard the alarm go off.

842
01:49:55,054 --> 01:49:57,260
How long do we make the fuse?

843
01:49:57,681 --> 01:50:01,096
They're Germans,
they're gonna be punctual.

844
01:50:01,267 --> 01:50:03,260
Usually are.

845
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:12,937
We've run out of time.

846
01:50:18,951 --> 01:50:20,409
Twenty seconds?

847
01:50:20,827 --> 01:50:22,405
What do you say?

848
01:50:22,662 --> 01:50:25,070
It's your decision, colonel.

849
01:50:28,918 --> 01:50:30,910
I'm asking you.

850
01:50:33,297 --> 01:50:37,924
Twenty seconds sounds about right,
then we won't have so far to run.

851
01:50:49,312 --> 01:50:52,063
It would have been nice
to see that bridge go, huh?

852
01:50:52,231 --> 01:50:54,058
Yes, wouldn't it?

853
01:50:56,610 --> 01:51:00,525
All been very interesting,
though, hasn't it?

854
01:51:01,699 --> 01:51:02,730
Yes.

855
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:30,838
It didn't do a goddamn thing! Nothing!

856
01:52:51,592 --> 01:52:55,921
Miller! That useless git!

857
01:52:56,096 --> 01:52:58,421
- It didn't...
- What?

858
01:52:58,598 --> 01:53:02,762
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!

859
01:53:02,936 --> 01:53:05,972
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

860
01:53:06,147 --> 01:53:10,061
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!

861
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:15,939
Nothing!

862
01:53:16,115 --> 01:53:18,356
We've been through
all this, and nothing!

863
01:53:18,533 --> 01:53:20,407
Nothing but:

864
01:53:20,785 --> 01:53:25,779
You can't expect an enormous volcano
with three tiny bags of explosives.

865
01:53:26,832 --> 01:53:29,585
You have to let nature take her course.

866
01:53:30,003 --> 01:53:32,126
Give it time, it'll work.

867
01:54:11,999 --> 01:54:14,953
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!

868
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:33,125
- You son of a bitch!
- I told you, it's only a matter of waiting.

869
01:56:40,053 --> 01:56:44,715
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.

870
01:56:44,892 --> 01:56:48,936
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a... You did it!

871
01:56:49,479 --> 01:56:52,148
Why, you limey genius, I love you!

872
01:56:52,315 --> 01:56:54,023
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.

873
01:56:54,191 --> 01:56:55,983
You did it!

874
02:01:23,107 --> 02:01:25,479
Miller, you horrible little man...

875
02:01:25,651 --> 02:01:28,486
...you knew that was gonna be
a slow-motion explosion.

876
02:01:28,654 --> 02:01:30,942
You deliberately didn't tell me,
did you?

877
02:01:31,114 --> 02:01:33,652
I didn't want to bore you
with technical detail.

878
02:01:33,825 --> 02:01:36,066
I thought it might be
a bit over your head.

879
02:01:36,244 --> 02:01:37,739
What happened to you?

880
02:01:37,913 --> 02:01:39,786
He bit me in all the excitement.

881
02:01:39,956 --> 02:01:43,040
But damn it to hell, we did it,
colonel, we did it!

882
02:01:43,209 --> 02:01:45,415
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did!

883
02:01:45,586 --> 02:01:47,495
And a merry Christmas.

884
02:01:47,671 --> 02:01:51,585
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.

885
02:01:53,093 --> 02:01:54,207
But before...

886
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:58,254
...we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...

887
02:01:58,765 --> 02:02:01,766
...and Congressional Medals of Honor
and so on...

888
02:02:01,935 --> 02:02:04,307
...and so forth and such like...

889
02:02:04,646 --> 02:02:09,058
...I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.

890
02:02:10,026 --> 02:02:14,402
That two: We have no hope
whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.

891
02:02:14,696 --> 02:02:16,107
And that three:

892
02:02:16,281 --> 02:02:22,283
This neck of the woods will soon be
crawling with bad-tempered Germans.

893
02:02:22,537 --> 02:02:24,161
And four:

894
02:02:24,455 --> 02:02:27,871
I don't think that our little genius,
Sgt. Miller there...

895
02:02:28,042 --> 02:02:31,625
...has even got a box of matches
left in his suitcase.

896
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:37,422
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...

897
02:02:37,676 --> 02:02:42,136
...that we are going to have
a very long walk home.
