1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,010
Deep in the heart of the Aegean
lies the island of Navarone.

2
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:26,514
In 1943, it stood lik e a thorn
in the Allied side.

3
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:31,770
Newly designed radar-controlled guns
set in the heart of the ancient rock...

4
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:36,191
...gave the German High Command
total strategic dominance.

5
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,154
Air strik es and naval attacks
had proven costly and ineffective.

6
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:45,367
In desperation, the Allies turned
to infiltration.

7
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:49,621
On the night of September the 24th, a
specially trained commando group...

8
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:53,625
...succeeded in penetrating
the very heart of the gun complex...

9
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:57,545
...planted explosives at the base
of the giant shell hoists...

10
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:02,467
...then withdrew to await rescue
by ships of the <i>R</i>oyal Navy.

11
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:11,392
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 reps.

12
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,407
Fire!

13
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,116
Move! Move!

14
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,784
Come on, move it!

15
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,870
Move it!

16
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,872
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

17
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:24,961
Regulations state, sir, that in the
absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...

18
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,256
...the acting catering officer,
that's you, sir...

19
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:32,009
...shall authorize once per week,
the issue of offal.

20
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:33,595
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...

21
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:36,431
...is kidneys, liver,
tongue, brains...

22
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:38,558
Well, I'll be damned!

23
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,018
- Milly, how nice to see you!
- Hello, sir.

24
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:43,730
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.

25
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,774
I'm reporting to Cmdr. Jensen.

26
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,861
I gather you've been hurling yourself
over the white cliffs. How's the leg?

27
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,573
It's in the same place. I thought
they pensioned you off for good.

28
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,033
You still peddling
those whiz-bangs of yours?

29
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:59,037
Yes, we've got things that go boom
for all occasions.

30
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:02,123
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting...

31
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,960
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Cmdr. Jensen waiting.

32
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:09,297
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, together.

33
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,761
Corporal, put that in my office,
will you?

34
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,726
Mallory.

35
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:24,646
Take a pew. How's the leg?

36
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,773
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:29,442
Hear you've been attached
to Winston's toy shop.

38
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:32,820
"Department of Dirty Tricks"
as the Whitehall chaps call it.

39
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:35,115
Well, they speak very well of you.

40
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:40,203
Right. We need you chaps
for something rather special.

41
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:47,168
I'm afraid it's not exactly
a masterpiece...

42
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,505
...but I wonder if you can identify
this fellow.

43
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,346
Think back to Navarone.

44
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,473
I'd rather not, sir.

45
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,266
Nicolai?

46
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,646
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?

47
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:08,357
But what about him?

48
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:11,443
Andrea's people had him shot
as a traitor, didn't they?

49
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,194
Yes, so we were told.

50
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:14,613
In fact, he escaped.

51
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:17,366
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...

52
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:21,370
...who we believe is operating now
in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...

53
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,830
...posing as one Capt. Lescovar.

54
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,999
Now, you both knew Nicolai.

55
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:30,795
In fact, you're the only people we know
of can make a positive identification.

56
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,715
So I'd like you to go out there
and cope.

57
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,093
Cope, sir?

58
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:38,053
Kill him.

59
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,513
Discreetly, if possible.

60
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:43,141
But I'm a civilian now, sir.

61
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:44,726
Yes, we thought about that.

62
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:47,604
So you've been recalled
to the current and promoted.

63
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:49,314
Staff sergeant.

64
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:50,899
Awfully generous, sir.

65
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,193
Exactly how do we get there?

66
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,320
We're tacking you onto Force 10.

67
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,073
The code name for an operation
for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.

68
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,327
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?

69
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:05,038
It's being treated
on a need-to-know basis.

70
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,706
And you don't need to know.

71
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:07,374
And you don't need to know.

72
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,294
Barnsby, come in.

73
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,718
- Sir?
- Colonel.

74
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,930
Force 10 flies out tonight.

75
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,058
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.

76
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,684
I beg your pardon, sir?

77
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:29,771
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.

78
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:32,607
Just a sideshow.
This is Maj. Mallory, Sgt. Miller.

79
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:34,610
Lt. Col. Barnsby.

80
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:39,781
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been
planned down to the last detail.

81
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:43,534
The last thing we need are
a couple of passengers.

82
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:46,788
Maj. Mallory does have a certain
amount of experience.

83
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,289
I wouldn't doubt it.

84
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:51,126
We're talking about
some hard travelling, sir.

85
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:54,713
We've gotta move fast. My men
are young, in top physical shape.

86
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,050
- They're specially trained for this.
- I'm aware of that.

87
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:02,970
Sir, I am concerned about the safety
of my command.

88
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,682
Well, these chaps have got
a job to do as well.

89
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,977
And it's up to you to deliver them
safely to the Partisans.

90
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:11,437
And you leave for Italy
at 2300 hours...

91
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,566
...and you take off for Yugoslavia
the following night.

92
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,693
Very well, sir.

93
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,571
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.

94
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:25,702
Well, we'll do our best not to make
a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.

95
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,228
All right, enough!

96
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:04,032
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...

97
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:09,829
...we might be going to Yugoslavia
by walking on water.

98
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:19,297
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.

99
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,301
Stop it.

100
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:26,805
Nolan, kill the lights.
All right, out.

101
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:32,019
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.

102
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:47,492
You're gonna miss your plane
unless you join us now, major.

103
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,669
Remarkable way of getting
on an aircraft, don't you think so?

104
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:59,879
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?

105
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:03,841
It's not easy if you insist on climbing
through fences in the dark...

106
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:07,929
...when there's a perfectly good gate
half a mile up the road.

107
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,223
Anything we can do to help?

108
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,226
Yeah, you can keep quiet
and out of the way, major.

109
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:22,235
I don't have a lot of time
for explanations.

110
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:24,195
One thing that you don't know...

111
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:27,240
...is the last three Allied missions
into Yugoslavia...

112
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,534
...were blown right here in Italy.

113
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,583
So this time when we fly out, we're
not advertising the fact to anybody.

114
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:02,525
Holy cow, will you look
at those guys!

115
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:04,777
They're stealing half the field.

116
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:06,655
All right, hold it.

117
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:08,281
Wait for me.

118
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:12,744
Okay, men, let's go!

119
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:17,249
- Blake, take care of Rastus there.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,501
Okay, fellas, freeze.

121
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,169
Back off. Come on, get back.

122
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,296
And you, back, back!

123
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:26,967
Bill, Eddie, fetch those other guys
out of there.

124
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:04,546
What's your name, kid?

125
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:06,381
Walter.

126
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:13,305
What's yours?

127
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:16,141
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.

128
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,310
Walter.

129
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,702
Good evening.

130
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,084
Major, move!

131
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:46,712
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.

132
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,007
We're very much obliged to you,
sergeant.

133
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,050
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sgt. Weaver. Thank you.

134
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,262
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

135
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,513
- But, sir!
- All set, colonel.

136
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:57,599
- Still stuff outside?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:01,728
- Okay, Oberstein?
- Fine.

138
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,276
Hey, sir!

139
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,362
Where's Nolan?

140
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,699
I think you can take it
he won't be joining us.

141
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,703
Okay, let's go.

142
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:27,295
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...

143
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:28,797
...and you run out on me.

144
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:30,924
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.

145
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:34,261
Hey, man, don't push!
Don't push me!

146
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,514
- Look, you!
- I think it's a bit late for that now.

147
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:12,090
Look, you just shouldn't have
left me there. I saved you bums.

148
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:15,176
Well, we didn't think you'd like
where we're going.

149
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:17,471
You let me worry about that, huh?

150
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,390
That guy's gonna melt
into the landscape.

151
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:24,436
Yeah, them Partisans are gonna think
they've been invaded by Zulus.

152
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,314
Well, you are one man short.

153
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:30,859
Well, Nolan can handle a chute,
at least.

154
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:36,031
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.

155
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,034
That's right, you learn
on the way down.

156
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,288
I'd better go tell the colonel
we got us another passenger.

157
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,876
I think the colonel's got enough on
his plate for the moment, don't you?

158
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:09,814
So sorry.

159
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:14,611
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.

160
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,364
You never know.
It might come in useful.

161
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,914
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?

162
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:27,582
My pyjamas.

163
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:30,209
Looks like high-explosive pyjamas
to me.

164
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:31,670
Not to worry, old boy.

165
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:36,425
Been handling this since I blew up
the nursery with my first chemistry set.

166
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,885
Poor old nanny.

167
00:15:58,197 --> 00:15:59,448
We got company.

168
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,619
Cut two!

169
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,261
Reynolds, bail out!

170
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:08,516
Jump!

171
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,143
Go!

172
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,687
Come on, move it!

173
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:16,525
Come on, get out!

174
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:18,527
Come on, move!

175
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,574
Come on!

176
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:12,057
Mallory.

177
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,727
Okay.

178
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:19,564
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down!

179
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,410
Come on.

180
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,906
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.

181
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:12,492
Where's your Sgt. Miller?

182
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,886
How the hell did he get here?

183
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:58,724
You let him on the plane?

184
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:01,810
I think he more or less
invited himself.

185
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,909
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.

186
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:22,497
You don't call him man.
You call him sir, and you call me sir.

187
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:26,751
And as long as you're here, you do
as you're told. Understood, soldier?

188
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,636
Yes, sir.

189
00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:41,016
We've gotta get out of here
before that patrol comes back.

190
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:44,144
Lt. Reynolds, take point.
Sgt. Weaver, bring up the rear.

191
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:47,522
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.

192
00:22:48,774 --> 00:22:50,984
Organized young gentleman,
isn't he?

193
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:29,147
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.

194
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:32,442
If we keep going east, we'll
end up where we're supposed to.

195
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:35,153
How did we get stuck
with those two clowns?

196
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,407
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.

197
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:42,744
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.

198
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:46,080
Do you think that young man has
any idea where we are, Milly?

199
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:50,001
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.

200
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:53,087
I'll go and try and find out.

201
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:55,924
Yes, why don't you do that.

202
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,636
Excuse me, colonel.

203
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:02,055
Do you have any idea
where we are?

204
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:04,099
I've got a good idea where we are.

205
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:07,936
And how long it's gonna take to get
there, if you two can't keep up.

206
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:11,606
All right, let's move it.

207
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:30,333
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvellous.

208
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:33,294
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.

209
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:36,715
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.

210
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,300
Yes.

211
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:42,387
I've often thought that I'd rather like
to settle down there some day.

212
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:45,724
Looks like you're gonna have
to change your plans.

213
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:02,407
Take it easy.

214
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:11,624
Welcome.

215
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,044
Capt. Drazak.

216
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,797
Seventeenth Partisan Regiment.

217
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:19,591
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!

218
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:22,302
Thank you, Capt. Drazak.

219
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:25,138
They frightened you with bandages,
huh?

220
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:27,640
Without bandages you...

221
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:31,687
German, how you say:

222
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:33,647
You say, "flamethrower."

223
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:36,191
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.

224
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:38,776
Hello! Hello!

225
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:40,779
How do you do?

226
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:46,201
This is Maritza,
good soldier comrade.

227
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:49,621
How do you do,
good soldier comrade?

228
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:53,459
Hello, blackie.

229
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:13,812
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.

230
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,078
Back off, soldier.

231
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,590
I make big joke...

232
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:45,427
...but joke on me.

233
00:26:56,355 --> 00:27:00,359
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.

234
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:03,946
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.

235
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:05,447
Come.

236
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:07,991
Come, we go.

237
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:18,334
Where did you learn to punch
like that? Harvard?

238
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:21,463
No, Harlem. Colonel?

239
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:24,883
I'm not trying to get anybody
killed, least of all me.

240
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,387
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.

241
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:45,153
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.

242
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,157
Good, good. Well, it looks like
things may work out after all, huh?

243
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:52,994
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still
carry out our little sideshow.

244
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:54,997
Sorry about Force 10.

245
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:57,624
You're down to two men, aren't you?

246
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,293
Of course, I don't know
what your mission was...

247
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:05,006
...but obviously it just isn't
on now, is it, colonel?

248
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:42,627
Looks rather like your own youngster,
doesn't he?

249
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:44,546
Do you really think so?

250
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:57,726
Please, come.

251
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,353
Come, eat.

252
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:15,327
We are Chetniks...

253
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:17,704
...not stinking Partisans.

254
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:30,258
We hunt Allied commandos
like wild pigs!

255
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:33,094
We work with Germans.
They are our friends!

256
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:42,770
Good evening, gentlemen.

257
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:45,315
Maj. Schroeder, 11 th army corps.

258
00:29:45,524 --> 00:29:48,068
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.

259
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:50,278
We thought these people were
Partisans.

260
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:53,365
- Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
- Sure.

261
00:29:53,532 --> 00:29:56,618
Chetniks? Who would have
believed that?

262
00:29:56,785 --> 00:30:00,121
The other three Allied missions
that fell into our hands...

263
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,625
...were not quite so happy about it
as you appear to be.

264
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,710
I'm not surprised, sir.

265
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:10,048
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.

266
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,051
Deserters?

267
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:16,805
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.

268
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:21,226
You see, we were
in a prison camp in Termoli.

269
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:22,436
We escaped.

270
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:25,772
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.

271
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:30,818
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and
landed in your territory, thank God.

272
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:33,321
Fascinating.

273
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:38,368
Tell me, why exactly
did you desert?

274
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:40,704
Now, I'm glad you asked that.

275
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:42,747
Yes.

276
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:46,585
Well, I am afraid
that is rather a long story.

277
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:50,756
Oh, please, you must not
be afraid of boring me.

278
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:55,009
Have you ever heard of penicillin?

279
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:56,511
No.

280
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,474
Well, I'm not surprised.
It's new.

281
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,560
It's a drug that prevents wounds
from becoming infected.

282
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,354
It cures a whole range of infections...

283
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:09,525
...including some of the nastier
social diseases.

284
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:13,945
It's become one of the most
sought-after items on the black market.

285
00:31:14,113 --> 00:31:17,533
Our friend here, Sgt. Weaver
of the American Medical Corps...

286
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:20,076
...was our supplier.

287
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:28,085
You are saying you stole these drugs
from the Army to sell to civilians?

288
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:34,174
Not just to civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.

289
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,551
Any army.

290
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,261
I see.

291
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:44,684
Tell me, what has all this to do
with that suitcase you keep looking at?

292
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,563
Well, that suitcase
is full of our penicillin.

293
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:50,899
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?

294
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,734
Certainly, major.

295
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,485
Open it, Miller.

296
00:31:56,196 --> 00:31:58,656
You can't do that here,
you'd ruin the lot.

297
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:02,202
You know perfectly well that
any contamination will destroy it.

298
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:04,579
It must be opened
under laboratory conditions.

299
00:32:04,746 --> 00:32:07,707
There's nearly half a million
pounds worth of stuff here.

300
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:11,295
I know all that, but the major
is not interested in our penicillin.

301
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:13,379
He only wants to know the truth.

302
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:16,883
What's the use of a half a million
pounds to you out here?

303
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,597
Yes, well, that's beside the point,
sir, but I'm not going to open it.

304
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,437
Our story doesn't seem
to convince you.

305
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,689
No, it does not.

306
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:34,902
That's up to you, but every word
he's told you is true.

307
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:38,196
If you don't believe it,
check with your intelligence.

308
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:40,239
They'll verify the entire story.

309
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:44,077
Oh, I shall certainly verify
your story.

310
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,997
Every word of it.

311
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,624
Get in!

312
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:02,512
Cute story, major, very cute.

313
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,891
Now, what happens
when they open the suitcase?

314
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:09,728
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?

315
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,610
Headquarters acknowledges
your signal.

316
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,612
Thank you, Bauer.

317
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,804
Maritza...

318
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,516
...what do you think?

319
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:50,811
They're lying.

320
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:53,271
What does it matter, anyway?

321
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:55,607
Kill them.

322
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:58,443
Yeah, you are probably right.

323
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:03,949
Do you know what I was thinking?

324
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,535
After the war, $1 million.

325
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:10,079
You, a simple peasant girl
from where?

326
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:13,583
I can never pronounce the name
of the place you come from.

327
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,012
With so much money, we could...

328
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,598
They're lying.

329
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,599
Kill them.

330
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:42,279
Out! Get out.

331
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:30,243
What did I tell you?

332
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,413
Well, at least we got
a good night's sleep.

333
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:46,885
Good morning, gentlemen.

334
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:52,349
Our intelligence confirms
your escape from Italy.

335
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:56,102
You and you, follow me, please.

336
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:12,494
Your escape from Italy
is one thing.

337
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:15,705
The rest of your story
is something else.

338
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,334
I had time to sleep on it.

339
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,921
So this morning,
you know what I did?

340
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:27,134
I opened the suitcase.

341
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,761
Maritza!

342
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,102
And what do you think I found?

343
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,316
Firewood.

344
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,157
What did you expect? We buried it
before your Chetniks picked us up.

345
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:53,660
We're not stupid. It's the only thing
we've got to bargain with.

346
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:57,664
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.

347
00:36:57,831 --> 00:37:01,251
You know they're lying. Why don't
you let Drazak get rid of them?

348
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:03,128
Gently, Maritza.

349
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,881
I don't believe your so-called penicillin
exists, but it just might.

350
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:09,843
So I will let you go
and dig it up for me.

351
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:15,640
And if we do, you'll shoot us
and bury us in the same hole.

352
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,393
I shall certainly shoot you
if you don't.

353
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,315
Well, gentlemen,
the choice is yours.

354
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:57,098
What I can't figure is how
the firewood got in the case.

355
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:59,226
Neither can I.

356
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:03,772
Don't know where we're going to find
any spare penicillin here, do you?

357
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:07,525
What are we going to do, keep
walking until we reach the Adriatic?

358
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:10,611
I don't think the iron maiden
will let us get that far.

359
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,405
Halt!

360
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:16,826
What did I tell you?

361
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,205
We are three miles past the spot
where you were picked up.

362
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:23,541
Well, where is this
wonderful treasure?

363
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:26,002
In your imagination?

364
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,547
No, ma'am,
it's not in our imagination.

365
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:31,048
I think it's a bit further on,
don't you?

366
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:34,511
Yes, it is. Well, I mean,
it's not much further than this.

367
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,264
It's hard to tell,
the whole country looks alike.

368
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:39,975
You will start digging
within five minutes.

369
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,145
What if we haven't found it
in five minutes?

370
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,441
Then you will be digging
your graves.

371
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:13,675
Hey, colonel.

372
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:15,844
Wait a minute,
now this looks familiar.

373
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:18,847
Isn't this our little hollow
down here?

374
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:21,933
Yes, I think it is.

375
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:26,646
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.

376
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:28,565
I think this is it.

377
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:30,400
- This knoll over here?
- Right.

378
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:34,153
You see, comrade, we lined it up
between them...

379
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:38,867
There you are!
There's our pile of stones.

380
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,921
Gotta get them closer
and we use the spades.

381
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,467
You take the two
that are closest to you...

382
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:58,720
...and I'll take the other one
and the broad.

383
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,655
I'm gonna get them
closer now, okay?

384
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:25,997
Fritz. Fritz, come!
It's here.

385
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:31,878
- Ready?
- All right.

386
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:41,930
You can get up now.
They're dead.

387
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:54,234
I put firewood in people's cases
and hide their high explosives.

388
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:55,902
Don't sit there gawping.

389
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:59,363
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.

390
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:02,617
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.

391
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:04,619
Now, go.

392
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:07,164
Excuse me,
good comrade soldier...

393
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:11,585
...but exactly what story are you
gonna tell Schroeder about all this?

394
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:14,587
You took us by surprise.

395
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:16,673
You got away.

396
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:19,467
Here, hit me.

397
00:41:21,386 --> 00:41:24,180
Did you expect me to go back there
with my hair combed?

398
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:25,349
Hit me!

399
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:29,727
Well, all right. I'm sorry.

400
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,940
Harder!

401
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,818
Come on, colonel.

402
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:11,019
I hope that man Schroeder
believes that girl's story.

403
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,315
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better
think twice about calling her a liar.

404
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:22,071
What about Miller and Reynolds?

405
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:26,951
What about them, colonel?

406
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,790
Yes.

407
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:36,503
I suppose they...

408
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,506
Let's move it.

409
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,487
Do you have the feeling
we're being followed?

410
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:05,240
About the last 10 minutes.

411
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,170
Next time you can play the corpse.

412
00:44:43,172 --> 00:44:45,924
Yeah, you seem pretty good
with that thing, though.

413
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,176
Could have been luck.

414
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:40,562
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.

415
00:46:04,503 --> 00:46:06,963
Partisans, thank God!

416
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,174
Good morning.

417
00:46:09,758 --> 00:46:11,384
Good morning.

418
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:30,611
What's the matter with him?
We've been looking for you.

419
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:32,155
Be quiet.

420
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,949
You will make your report
to Maj. Petrovitch.

421
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,248
I think we've run into
bad company, colonel.

422
00:47:23,415 --> 00:47:25,083
Yes, the leader.

423
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,794
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.

424
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,588
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?

425
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,633
It's Nicolai Lescovar.

426
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:37,012
The man I was sent to kill.

427
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:20,722
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.

428
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,224
So do I. Right in it.

429
00:48:25,853 --> 00:48:27,980
Do you think he's recognized you?

430
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:30,357
Yes, I think so.

431
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:38,049
Lt. Col. Barnsby,
United States Rangers.

432
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:39,425
Maj. Mallory, sir.

433
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,437
You got away from the Germans.

434
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,773
How?

435
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:54,816
We escaped.

436
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:08,747
Capt. Lescovar
has his doubts about that.

437
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:12,668
If you escaped, why were
the Germans not pursuing you?

438
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,629
We observed you for five miles
before we picked you up.

439
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:20,842
You should've observed that we killed
two Chetniks that were following us.

440
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:24,512
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.

441
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:28,892
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.

442
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:33,647
Comrades of ours whom we had
infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...

443
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:37,860
...so now all links with our agent there
are broken, thanks to you.

444
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:42,280
I'm sorry.

445
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,784
The fact remains
that we're Allied officers.

446
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,495
There's no reason
we should be treated this way.

447
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:51,748
I'm in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...

448
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,501
...to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.

449
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:59,214
We are informed
of many things by London...

450
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:02,550
...very few of them
ever seem to materialize.

451
00:51:02,718 --> 00:51:04,177
However, you are right.

452
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,264
I was informed of your mission.

453
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,851
Personally, I doubt if it was
ever a practical one...

454
00:51:11,018 --> 00:51:16,148
...but now that you are here without
equipment, the question is academic.

455
00:51:16,315 --> 00:51:22,154
And you, major, you came here
as an observer, perhaps?

456
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:23,488
No, sir.

457
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:26,574
I was charged with a mission
of my own.

458
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:28,035
It's confidential.

459
00:51:29,203 --> 00:51:31,413
Confidential!

460
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,083
Sometimes I get the impression...

461
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,086
...that London looks
on this theatre of operations...

462
00:51:38,253 --> 00:51:42,257
...as a convenient place for conducting
what they call "war games."

463
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:46,136
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.

464
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,762
- I mean alone.
- No.

465
00:51:50,682 --> 00:51:54,102
The People's Army does not conduct
military business in secret.

466
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,438
Very well, sir.

467
00:51:56,605 --> 00:52:00,900
I was sent here to identify a German
agent, code name Nicolai.

468
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,445
We are reliably informed...

469
00:52:03,612 --> 00:52:07,824
...that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...

470
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,951
...as Capt. Lescovar.

471
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,789
And having identified this man,
what were your further orders?

472
00:52:14,456 --> 00:52:16,291
I was to eliminate him, sir.

473
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:22,213
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.

474
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:24,883
Do you hear that, Lescovar?

475
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,636
The gentlemen from London
want us to shoot you.

476
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:44,777
I'm sorry, major.

477
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,281
I must admit you are
indeed partly right.

478
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:51,952
There was an agent
named Nicolai...

479
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,915
...operating somewhere south of here
and also calling himself Lescovar.

480
00:52:57,124 --> 00:53:01,837
But he was identified many
months ago. And eliminated.

481
00:53:02,004 --> 00:53:05,007
The British were informed.

482
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:11,471
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...

483
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:13,765
...and just as frequently wrong!

484
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:16,684
Lt. Marko,
see that these gentlemen...

485
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:20,689
...give you a full report on their
activities in the Chetnik camp.

486
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:23,567
A specific report.

487
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,551
Well, captain, I guess we owe you
a bit of an apology, don't we?

488
00:53:49,718 --> 00:53:53,805
Well, it happens. We all
get badly briefed sometimes.

489
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:57,809
Wish we had been briefed
about the men with the bandages.

490
00:53:58,227 --> 00:54:01,605
Replaced them with a couple
of your own, that's a good trick.

491
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:05,192
They were messengers to our agent
at Schroeder's headquarters.

492
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,111
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...

493
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,072
...beautiful grey eyes
and shoots from the hip?

494
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,909
You mean Maritza?
Yes.

495
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:16,203
She took a big chance for us.

496
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:18,621
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter
for nothing.

497
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:33,553
We hold this end of the bridge.

498
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,556
Over there, the Germans
prepare for the final attack.

499
00:54:36,723 --> 00:54:40,143
We have been ordered to prevent
them crossing at all costs.

500
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,603
What exactly do they have
over there?

501
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:46,566
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.

502
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:49,778
Soon they will bring up tanks, then...

503
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:54,074
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.

504
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:57,577
Each time we lost valuable men.

505
00:54:58,036 --> 00:55:01,539
Maj. Petrovitch has decided
it is impractical.

506
00:55:01,707 --> 00:55:03,208
Well, he's wrong about that.

507
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:06,461
There's no bridge in the world
that can't be blown.

508
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:09,464
That's what Force 10
was here to prove.

509
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:23,186
I told you before, you have no men,
you have no equipment.

510
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:27,106
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.

511
00:55:27,274 --> 00:55:31,528
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip
for a plane that may never arrive.

512
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,988
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.

513
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:36,533
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.

514
00:55:36,742 --> 00:55:41,163
You mean you can blow 20
of my men to hell, for nothing!

515
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:44,791
That bridge is indestructible.

516
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,711
Excuse me, sir,
you don't need 20 men.

517
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,296
You need Miller.

518
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:52,299
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.

519
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:55,010
He's probably the best in England.

520
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:58,763
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.

521
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:02,016
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.

522
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:04,561
Not necessarily, major.

523
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:08,899
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation
just to find out, colonel.

524
00:56:09,108 --> 00:56:11,944
I need every single man
I've got here, now!

525
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:16,198
Sir, we don't need to mount
a full-scale operation.

526
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:18,450
Just give us two men.

527
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:56,947
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.

528
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:01,368
You reported five prisoners, major.

529
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:07,833
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.

530
00:57:36,445 --> 00:57:40,031
Maj. Schroeder is in the armoury,
and I have told you before...

531
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:44,119
...this area is out of bounds
to you people, except Capt. Drazak.

532
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:48,540
Kindly remove yourselves
immediately...

533
00:57:48,707 --> 00:57:53,294
...and if you can read, which I doubt,
take a look at standing orders.

534
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,464
There. You have made me
burn the milk.

535
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:57,924
So I did.

536
00:57:58,091 --> 00:57:59,592
Let it burn.

537
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:48,266
Open up.

538
00:58:50,936 --> 00:58:54,189
Prisoners for Maj. Schroeder.

539
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:19,298
You see, my colleague does not
believe you are deserters.

540
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:25,762
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?

541
00:59:28,724 --> 00:59:31,393
I thought you said these men
had been shot.

542
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:24,446
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?

543
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:26,572
No!

544
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:32,913
This is not correct.

545
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,567
Quick. Miller!

546
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,853
Bring him. Open it.

547
01:01:56,997 --> 01:01:59,541
- Go.
- Marko.

548
01:02:13,055 --> 01:02:14,389
Partisan bitch!

549
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:21,063
Always so kind to the men
with burns.

550
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:25,108
But they have no burns.

551
01:02:38,497 --> 01:02:41,249
The three Germans
with the prisoners that escaped...

552
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:45,086
...all shot in the back
with machine pistols.

553
01:02:46,088 --> 01:02:47,756
You killed them.

554
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,945
Good. Give me the hat.

555
01:03:39,725 --> 01:03:41,601
Open. Open up.

556
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,147
Open!

557
01:03:46,774 --> 01:03:48,650
Open!

558
01:04:44,123 --> 01:04:45,666
Milly.

559
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:52,774
Weaver, don't stand there like
an idiot. Let's get this truck moving.

560
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,031
She okay?

561
01:05:59,698 --> 01:06:02,325
Well, we'll drive as carefully
as we can.

562
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:08,582
Hey, you.
I don't like the way you talk.

563
01:06:09,082 --> 01:06:12,126
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.

564
01:06:12,294 --> 01:06:15,588
This truck doesn't move till somebody
tells me what's going on.

565
01:06:15,756 --> 01:06:17,174
Now, look, you...

566
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,634
You bigtime officers
have shafted me twice.

567
01:06:19,802 --> 01:06:22,721
You tried to dump me in Italy,
ran out on me back there.

568
01:06:22,888 --> 01:06:27,142
You expect me to drive you like some
chauffeur. Nobody tells me anything.

569
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:30,353
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.

570
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:34,358
Excuse me, but is your trouble
that you want to be part of the team?

571
01:06:34,566 --> 01:06:36,859
I don't want to be a part
of any lousy team.

572
01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:39,863
I just want some equal consideration.

573
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:45,326
I don't think you'll get
equal consideration...

574
01:06:45,494 --> 01:06:47,954
...from those people back there.
Do you?

575
01:06:48,497 --> 01:06:50,707
I don't care if they're
the U.S. Cavalry.

576
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:54,502
Nobody moves until somebody
tells me what you're planning to do.

577
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,923
- We're going to blow up a bridge.
- A bridge?

578
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,634
Whose bridge?
Not me, I'm blowing up nothing.

579
01:07:00,926 --> 01:07:04,512
We are going to help the Partisans
blow up a bridge...

580
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:07,432
...and then if we're very lucky,
we can all go home.

581
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:10,602
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.

582
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:13,438
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.

583
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:15,648
You didn't give a mother-hunch
about me.

584
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:18,610
You came back for Miller,
but you didn't come for me?

585
01:07:18,944 --> 01:07:22,155
No, we didn't.

586
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:32,624
That's the first straight answer
you've given me.

587
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:39,756
I think the major's
got a point, colonel.

588
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:42,300
They do look kind of mean,
don't they?

589
01:07:45,137 --> 01:07:48,974
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
Get in there and drive the truck!

590
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:49,891
All right.

591
01:07:49,892 --> 01:07:50,809
All right.

592
01:08:06,742 --> 01:08:09,035
We'll have to do this another way.

593
01:08:09,203 --> 01:08:11,246
Get away from the truck.

594
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,749
Wait for my signal.

595
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:14,559
Useful little insect, isn't he?

596
01:09:14,768 --> 01:09:20,648
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable showoff.

597
01:09:20,816 --> 01:09:23,527
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.

598
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:29,491
So now it works, huh, sergeant?

599
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,287
Well, these babies are
a little temperamental sometimes.

600
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:35,497
Like me.

601
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:14,410
Lescovar's confirmed my signals
got through to London.

602
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,371
Do you like that chap?

603
01:10:16,538 --> 01:10:19,541
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.

604
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,751
I haven't thought anything
about him.

605
01:10:22,044 --> 01:10:25,881
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?

606
01:10:29,384 --> 01:10:30,760
All right, sergeant?

607
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:33,722
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?

608
01:10:33,889 --> 01:10:36,600
Well, no, not exactly.

609
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:38,602
In fact, not by a long chalk.

610
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:41,480
I'd say you're flogging
a dead horse there, old man.

611
01:10:41,647 --> 01:10:44,441
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?

612
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:47,235
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.

613
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:48,486
Oh, yeah?

614
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:52,407
In that case, you'll have noticed
how it's built into the living rock.

615
01:10:52,574 --> 01:10:56,578
And how those main pilings are not
just concrete, but 20 feet thick.

616
01:10:56,745 --> 01:10:58,204
That's not forgetting...

617
01:10:58,372 --> 01:11:01,458
I told you, London's dropping
the same stuff we had before.

618
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:05,128
Yes, I know what you're getting,
but it's not gonna be enough.

619
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:08,798
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...

620
01:11:08,966 --> 01:11:11,259
...burn the paint work
here and there.

621
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:15,138
But nothing that would seriously
inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.

622
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:19,350
Our experts have been studying
that bridge, and they say it'll blow.

623
01:11:19,518 --> 01:11:21,269
I don't know where you learned...

624
01:11:21,437 --> 01:11:24,565
...but I'm talking about
the best engineers in the business.

625
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:27,400
Yes. They're probably experts
at building things...

626
01:11:27,568 --> 01:11:29,778
...whereas I'm an expert
at blowing them up.

627
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:32,614
Take it from me that
one would need eight hours...

628
01:11:32,781 --> 01:11:34,908
...to make a decent job
of that bridge.

629
01:11:35,075 --> 01:11:36,242
Eight hours?

630
01:11:36,452 --> 01:11:40,664
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are
kind enough to leave us in peace.

631
01:11:40,831 --> 01:11:43,041
And maybe provide
a few working lights.

632
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:46,586
You've seen those searchlights,
have you? Well, l...

633
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:48,629
- Miller.
- Sir.

634
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:51,550
I think you've made
your technical point.

635
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:53,593
Many thanks, sir.

636
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:59,099
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.

637
01:11:59,766 --> 01:12:03,019
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.

638
01:12:11,904 --> 01:12:14,781
What would happen to the bridge
if that central arch...

639
01:12:14,948 --> 01:12:18,868
...was suddenly hit
by several million tons of water?

640
01:12:19,077 --> 01:12:20,828
- Water?
- Water?

641
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,999
I think we've been talking
about the wrong target.

642
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:26,668
Remember that dam we passed
up around the bend?

643
01:12:26,835 --> 01:12:28,670
What kind of a dam?
Where is it?

644
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:30,672
Two and a half miles
up the river.

645
01:12:30,839 --> 01:12:33,299
But, my dear chap,
why didn't you say so before?

646
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:36,929
Oh, I could do a tremendous job
on a dam, yes.

647
01:12:37,137 --> 01:12:40,056
With a dam you've got natural
elements working for you.

648
01:12:40,224 --> 01:12:43,810
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.

649
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,813
Thank you.

650
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:49,024
Come along, gentlemen.

651
01:12:52,694 --> 01:12:56,364
As a technician, I thought you might
be interested in that dam, Milly.

652
01:12:56,532 --> 01:12:58,992
Get them outside
for the dropping zone.

653
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:07,543
So the RAF drops the stuff
and we blow the dam, right?

654
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:08,876
Right.

655
01:13:09,044 --> 01:13:12,881
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.

656
01:13:13,048 --> 01:13:15,050
Wouldn't know, old boy.

657
01:13:17,636 --> 01:13:21,056
How often have you used this
as a dropping zone?

658
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,141
Never.

659
01:13:23,308 --> 01:13:25,685
The Germans see to that.

660
01:13:25,894 --> 01:13:28,563
We have to keep moving around.

661
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,565
Makes sense.

662
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:35,320
You think those two guys know
anything about blowing a dam?

663
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,156
Oh, no, I shouldn't think
they've got a clue.

664
01:13:38,657 --> 01:13:40,325
But never mind, old Weaver...

665
01:13:40,492 --> 01:13:44,913
...we sergeants will see them through
as usual.

666
01:13:46,915 --> 01:13:49,667
- Right.
- Hello.

667
01:13:51,253 --> 01:13:53,713
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.

668
01:13:53,922 --> 01:13:55,506
Come on in, take a seat.

669
01:13:55,674 --> 01:13:58,760
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.

670
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:02,430
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.

671
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,766
No. I've seen too many airdrops.

672
01:14:04,933 --> 01:14:07,727
They don't compare
to a nice, warm bed.

673
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:30,292
Would you believe it?
Right on time.

674
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:11,077
I don't believe it.

675
01:17:11,286 --> 01:17:13,496
Poor bastards.

676
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:18,251
This was no accident.

677
01:17:21,922 --> 01:17:24,215
We've lost our last chance.

678
01:18:08,469 --> 01:18:11,180
There is no question.
We were betrayed.

679
01:18:11,346 --> 01:18:14,349
Aren't we always
with Allied missions?

680
01:18:14,516 --> 01:18:16,476
Their security's a joke.

681
01:18:16,643 --> 01:18:18,394
It doesn't matter.

682
01:18:18,562 --> 01:18:20,939
We do our part,
and what do we get?

683
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,275
Twenty lives lost.

684
01:18:23,817 --> 01:18:26,277
- One of them...
- It's past.

685
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:29,197
Finished.

686
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:34,994
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshalling their tanks.

687
01:18:35,204 --> 01:18:37,414
They will cross the bridge
tomorrow...

688
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:40,709
...and there is nothing
we can do to stop them.

689
01:18:41,543 --> 01:18:46,172
And you four gentlemen have
outstayed your usefulness.

690
01:18:47,716 --> 01:18:50,677
You will be escorted back
to the Allied military mission.

691
01:18:50,844 --> 01:18:52,303
Out of harm's way?

692
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,391
Sir...

693
01:18:57,559 --> 01:19:00,812
...I could leave the Germans
some very nasty surprises.

694
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:03,523
Thank you, sergeant.

695
01:19:04,108 --> 01:19:07,236
I think we have had
enough surprises.

696
01:19:08,612 --> 01:19:13,950
Capt. Lescovar, see that these
gentlemen have an escort of two men.

697
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:32,344
If those chaps had just half
the equipment of the Jerries...

698
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:35,263
...I could've made that dam
look like a Swiss cheese.

699
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:37,473
It's absolutely sickening.

700
01:19:37,683 --> 01:19:41,520
Do you think the Jerries will have that
gear we need in their supply dump?

701
01:19:41,728 --> 01:19:42,895
Of course they would.

702
01:19:43,063 --> 01:19:47,442
Lashings of HE, land mines,
detonators, everything.

703
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,569
It's an absolute certainty.

704
01:19:50,821 --> 01:19:52,531
Your escort, colonel.

705
01:19:52,865 --> 01:19:55,951
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.

706
01:19:56,118 --> 01:19:59,621
I think we're going to need
rather more men than this, captain.

707
01:19:59,788 --> 01:20:03,374
My sergeant thinks that the Germans
have the necessary equipment...

708
01:20:03,584 --> 01:20:08,130
...in their forward supply dump
so that the colonel can blow the dam.

709
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:14,052
That means you'd have to get
into the marshalling yards at Mostar.

710
01:20:15,262 --> 01:20:18,390
None of you speak enough German.

711
01:20:22,019 --> 01:20:23,562
You need me to help.

712
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,481
Thank you, captain.

713
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:33,715
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?

714
01:21:45,894 --> 01:21:48,354
You look real beautiful,
you know that?

715
01:21:48,522 --> 01:21:51,650
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.

716
01:21:52,401 --> 01:21:54,778
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?

717
01:21:54,945 --> 01:21:58,865
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.

718
01:22:38,655 --> 01:22:41,741
Pity they didn't teach you German
at that school of yours.

719
01:22:41,909 --> 01:22:45,120
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.

720
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,922
These any use to you?

721
01:22:55,088 --> 01:22:56,881
No, tellermines is what we want.

722
01:22:57,049 --> 01:23:00,093
They look like dirty
grey-green dinner plates.

723
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,680
Maybe they just haven't got any.

724
01:23:05,224 --> 01:23:07,059
They have.

725
01:24:15,002 --> 01:24:18,296
I wonder what happened
to Barnsby and his truck.

726
01:24:18,464 --> 01:24:21,467
I've been asking myself
the same question.

727
01:24:21,633 --> 01:24:25,011
Well, we can't just stand here
like ducks in thunder.

728
01:24:26,555 --> 01:24:30,475
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.

729
01:24:56,251 --> 01:25:00,255
Barnsby should have been here
by now. Where the hell is he?

730
01:25:01,048 --> 01:25:02,841
Beautiful.

731
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:06,552
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.

732
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,597
Well, I'd rather do it now
than in some ditch.

733
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:11,725
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...

734
01:25:11,892 --> 01:25:13,351
...given peace and quiet.

735
01:25:13,519 --> 01:25:16,438
These little sods
can be temperamental.

736
01:25:16,605 --> 01:25:20,692
The gubbins itself is harmless enough
but aren't we all, until detonated.

737
01:25:57,813 --> 01:25:59,648
For a moment
I thought we were off.

738
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:05,278
Hey, where in the hell
have they gotten to?

739
01:26:08,073 --> 01:26:09,866
You maniac.

740
01:26:10,033 --> 01:26:12,243
What the hell are you doing here?

741
01:26:12,536 --> 01:26:16,456
I'll go and have a look around,
see if I can find them.

742
01:26:40,272 --> 01:26:43,316
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.

743
01:26:50,032 --> 01:26:51,408
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.

744
01:26:51,575 --> 01:26:53,201
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...

745
01:26:53,368 --> 01:26:55,286
...but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

746
01:26:55,287 --> 01:26:56,037
...but ten to one they're hiding
in that boxcar.

747
01:27:11,637 --> 01:27:13,055
Bloody hell.

748
01:27:13,388 --> 01:27:15,515
What's up now?

749
01:27:15,682 --> 01:27:19,352
Some great ape of a sergeant,
he's sent Barnsby's truck away.

750
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:20,728
Oh, no.

751
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:24,858
Sergeant.

752
01:27:26,401 --> 01:27:28,528
Be quiet. Listen to me.

753
01:27:29,071 --> 01:27:32,908
There are two British commanders
in that cattle truck behind me.

754
01:27:34,993 --> 01:27:38,746
I'm Col. Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field Intelligence Group.

755
01:27:39,957 --> 01:27:42,417
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.

756
01:27:43,293 --> 01:27:46,546
There is a third,
an American colonel...

757
01:27:46,755 --> 01:27:49,424
...in the truck which you
just sent away.

758
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,342
I want to take them all together.

759
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,430
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.

760
01:27:57,266 --> 01:28:01,645
Go and assemble a squad
of armed men. Quickly and quietly.

761
01:28:01,812 --> 01:28:03,438
And keep them out of sight.

762
01:28:03,897 --> 01:28:06,649
Then report back to me.
Understand?

763
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:18,578
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.

764
01:28:47,024 --> 01:28:48,483
All right, you guys, let's...

765
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:50,318
Oh, man.

766
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,447
The sacks, get them up here quick.

767
01:28:53,614 --> 01:28:57,200
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?

768
01:28:57,367 --> 01:29:01,287
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.

769
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:07,669
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.

770
01:29:07,836 --> 01:29:10,672
Help me get this stuff loaded
and get it on the truck.

771
01:29:34,613 --> 01:29:36,448
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.

772
01:29:36,615 --> 01:29:39,451
Let's go. Easy.

773
01:29:40,536 --> 01:29:42,246
Hold it.

774
01:29:43,122 --> 01:29:45,249
It's that man again.

775
01:29:45,624 --> 01:29:48,501
I'll take care of him. Close the door.

776
01:29:59,429 --> 01:30:02,223
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.

777
01:30:14,111 --> 01:30:16,071
All clear?

778
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,032
Give them a moment
to get out of sight.

779
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,900
That fool, Marko,
must have given himself away.

780
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:36,693
I don't know how.

781
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:39,737
How in the hell are we gonna
get back across the river?

782
01:31:39,905 --> 01:31:41,489
I mean, where are we going?

783
01:31:41,657 --> 01:31:44,117
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.

784
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,038
Sarajevo.

785
01:31:49,289 --> 01:31:51,958
That's where the train goes.

786
01:31:52,668 --> 01:31:54,378
No stops.

787
01:32:39,214 --> 01:32:40,465
I'm sorry about Marko.

788
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,219
Thank you.

789
01:32:46,388 --> 01:32:48,515
It's a risk we all take.

790
01:32:50,517 --> 01:32:54,187
He was a brave man
and a good friend.

791
01:32:55,481 --> 01:32:57,608
Pity he got careless.

792
01:32:58,442 --> 01:33:01,528
Do you think that big sergeant
spotted him as a Partisan?

793
01:33:03,363 --> 01:33:05,406
I can't buy that.

794
01:33:05,991 --> 01:33:08,702
The sergeant wasn't that bright.

795
01:33:11,455 --> 01:33:15,125
He saluted you,
you're wearing a corporal's uniform.

796
01:33:15,834 --> 01:33:18,378
That doesn't rate a salute
in the German army.

797
01:33:18,921 --> 01:33:21,214
Not in anybody's army.

798
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:25,927
Why do you think
he saluted you, Lescovar?

799
01:33:32,101 --> 01:33:36,396
Perhaps he recognized
my natural superiority.

800
01:33:36,814 --> 01:33:38,774
Yes, perhaps.

801
01:33:47,074 --> 01:33:50,911
You say this train goes
to Sarajevo, no stops?

802
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:53,497
Yeah.

803
01:33:54,998 --> 01:33:59,877
But I noticed on the map that we pass
within a half a mile of the dam.

804
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:03,756
Strange you didn't bother
to mention that.

805
01:34:14,101 --> 01:34:16,478
Now, what's all this about?

806
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:19,439
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...

807
01:34:19,606 --> 01:34:22,567
...and I forget to mention
that we pass near the dam.

808
01:34:24,695 --> 01:34:30,367
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.

809
01:34:31,285 --> 01:34:33,912
I don't think he gave anything away...

810
01:34:34,204 --> 01:34:36,080
...except his life.

811
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:40,878
What did you give away, Lescovar?

812
01:35:00,355 --> 01:35:03,191
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?

813
01:35:03,901 --> 01:35:07,404
I don't think, I know.

814
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:09,823
I've always known.

815
01:35:10,073 --> 01:35:12,116
I just couldn't prove it.

816
01:35:14,703 --> 01:35:16,538
You're Nicolai.

817
01:35:16,705 --> 01:35:18,998
You're the man who
blew us in Greece.

818
01:35:45,984 --> 01:35:48,027
Thank you, colonel.

819
01:35:52,574 --> 01:35:54,701
I've done your job.

820
01:35:55,869 --> 01:35:58,079
You help me do mine.

821
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:44,209
Oh, crikey.

822
01:36:45,836 --> 01:36:47,754
It's lit like a Christmas tree.

823
01:36:52,801 --> 01:36:54,469
Dawn's around 5:30.

824
01:36:55,721 --> 01:36:57,264
Gives us an hour to get in...

825
01:36:57,431 --> 01:37:01,184
...half-hour to set the charges
and 20 minutes to get clear.

826
01:37:02,853 --> 01:37:06,147
What you need, sir,
is a little diversion, isn't it?

827
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,070
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.

828
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:01,656
Try and imagine you're a dog.

829
01:40:02,407 --> 01:40:06,327
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road!

830
01:40:40,112 --> 01:40:41,863
Hallelujah!

831
01:41:21,612 --> 01:41:24,364
Just unroll it and string it out.

832
01:43:18,103 --> 01:43:20,063
Come on, blackie.

833
01:43:23,317 --> 01:43:25,152
Come on, blackie.

834
01:43:26,445 --> 01:43:28,029
Come on.

835
01:43:38,457 --> 01:43:42,461
Hey. You bleed red blood,
eh, blackie?

836
01:46:36,343 --> 01:46:37,594
Here.

837
01:46:38,345 --> 01:46:39,721
Right here.

838
01:47:28,312 --> 01:47:29,313
You all right?

839
01:48:08,685 --> 01:48:11,729
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!

840
01:48:11,897 --> 01:48:14,983
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.

841
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:18,319
If they'd been caught,
we'd have heard the alarm go off.

842
01:49:55,042 --> 01:49:57,252
How long do we make the fuse?

843
01:49:57,669 --> 01:50:01,089
They're Germans,
they're gonna be punctual.

844
01:50:01,256 --> 01:50:03,216
Usually are.

845
01:50:11,099 --> 01:50:12,934
We've run out of time.

846
01:50:18,941 --> 01:50:20,400
Twenty seconds?

847
01:50:20,818 --> 01:50:22,402
What do you say?

848
01:50:22,653 --> 01:50:25,030
It's your decision, colonel.

849
01:50:28,909 --> 01:50:30,911
I'm asking you.

850
01:50:33,288 --> 01:50:37,917
Twenty seconds sounds about right,
then we won't have so far to run.

851
01:50:49,304 --> 01:50:52,056
It would have been nice
to see that bridge go, huh?

852
01:50:52,224 --> 01:50:54,059
Yes, wouldn't it?

853
01:50:56,603 --> 01:51:00,523
All been very interesting,
though, hasn't it?

854
01:51:01,692 --> 01:51:02,693
Yes.

855
01:51:26,884 --> 01:51:30,804
It didn't do a goddamn thing! Nothing!

856
01:52:51,593 --> 01:52:55,930
Miller! That useless git!

857
01:52:56,098 --> 01:52:58,391
- It didn't...
- What?

858
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:02,770
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!

859
01:53:02,938 --> 01:53:05,982
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

860
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:10,070
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!

861
01:53:14,283 --> 01:53:15,951
Nothing!

862
01:53:16,118 --> 01:53:18,328
We've been through
all this, and nothing!

863
01:53:18,537 --> 01:53:20,413
Nothing but:

864
01:53:20,789 --> 01:53:25,752
You can't expect an enormous volcano
with three tiny bags of explosives.

865
01:53:26,837 --> 01:53:29,589
You have to let nature take her course.

866
01:53:30,007 --> 01:53:32,134
Give it time, it'll work.

867
01:54:12,007 --> 01:54:14,968
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!

868
01:56:29,478 --> 01:56:33,148
- You son of a bitch!
- I told you, it's only a matter of waiting.

869
01:56:40,072 --> 01:56:44,743
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.

870
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:48,955
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a... You did it!

871
01:56:49,498 --> 01:56:52,167
Why, you limey genius, I love you!

872
01:56:52,334 --> 01:56:54,044
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.

873
01:56:54,211 --> 01:56:56,004
You did it!

874
02:01:23,147 --> 02:01:25,524
Miller, you horrible little man...

875
02:01:25,691 --> 02:01:28,527
...you knew that was gonna be
a slow-motion explosion.

876
02:01:28,694 --> 02:01:30,987
You deliberately didn't tell me,
did you?

877
02:01:31,155 --> 02:01:33,699
I didn't want to bore you
with technical detail.

878
02:01:33,866 --> 02:01:36,076
I thought it might be
a bit over your head.

879
02:01:36,285 --> 02:01:37,786
What happened to you?

880
02:01:37,953 --> 02:01:39,829
He bit me in all the excitement.

881
02:01:39,997 --> 02:01:43,083
But damn it to hell, we did it,
colonel, we did it!

882
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:45,460
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did!

883
02:01:45,627 --> 02:01:47,503
And a merry Christmas.

884
02:01:47,713 --> 02:01:51,633
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.

885
02:01:53,135 --> 02:01:54,219
But before...

886
02:01:54,761 --> 02:01:58,264
...we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...

887
02:01:58,807 --> 02:02:01,810
...and Congressional Medals of Honor
and so on...

888
02:02:01,977 --> 02:02:04,354
...and so forth and such like...

889
02:02:04,688 --> 02:02:09,109
...I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.

890
02:02:10,068 --> 02:02:14,447
That two: We have no hope
whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.

891
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:16,158
And that three:

892
02:02:16,325 --> 02:02:22,331
This neck of the woods will soon be
crawling with bad-tempered Germans.

893
02:02:22,581 --> 02:02:24,207
And four:

894
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,920
I don't think that our little genius,
Sgt. Miller there...

895
02:02:28,086 --> 02:02:31,672
...has even got a box of matches
left in his suitcase.

896
02:02:32,674 --> 02:02:37,470
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...

897
02:02:37,721 --> 02:02:42,183
...that we are going to have
a very long walk home.

898
02:05:42,197 --> 02:05:44,240
