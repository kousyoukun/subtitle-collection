1
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,475
(PA) Lucky Arrow breaking on top.
Purple Shadow is second.

2
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:14,099
(narrator) At exactly 3.45 on that Saturday
afternoon in the last week of September,

3
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:17,897
Marvin Unger was perhaps the only one
of the 100,000 people at the track

4
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:20,649
who felt no thrill at
the running of the fifth race.

5
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,158
He was disinterested in horse racing and
held a lifelong contempt for gambling.

6
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:29,449
Nevertheless, he had a five-dollar win bet
on every horse in the fifth race.

7
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:34,327
He knew this unique system of betting
would more than likely result in a loss.

8
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:38,923
But he didn't care. After all, he thought,
what would the loss of 30 dollars mean

9
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,751
in comparison to the vast sum
of money ultimately at stake?

10
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:46,671
- Bottle of ginger ale, please.
- Yes, sir. Comin' right up.

11
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:53,431
Favourite broke bad.
Could be anybody's race.

12
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:55,605
Could be.

13
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,944
He's in the five-dollar win,
next to the five-dollar place.

14
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,400
- Quite a crowd you got.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:09,285
(PA) Passing the quarter pole, it is
Lucky Arrow and Purple Shadow

16
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:12,369
with Stopwatch on the outside, third.

17
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,837
At the head of the stretch, it is
Purple Shadow leading by a length.

18
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,670
Lucky Arrow is second by three quarters.

19
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:23,005
Stopwatch, coming up on the outside,
is third by a length and a quarter.

20
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:28,014
Then Southern Star, Vain Effort, Stanley
Gabe, Third Row and Lover's Dilemma.

21
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:32,011
It is Lucky Arrow... he's lost it by
a head. Purple Shadow by a head,

22
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,603
and Stopwatch moving
fast on the outside.

23
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:37,901
It's Lucky Arrow, Purple Shadow
and Stopwatch neck and neck.

24
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,315
It's Lucky Arrow, Purple
Shadow and Stopwatch...

25
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,489
(crowd roars)

26
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:50,787
Purple Shadow second by a head,
Lucky Arrow third by a length

27
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:53,705
and Southern Star finished fourth.

28
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:18,695
(narrator) Waiting for the race
to become official, he began to feel

29
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,693
he had as much effect on
the outcome of the operation

30
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:26,784
as a piece of a jumbled jigsaw puzzle
has to its predetermined final design.

31
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:29,203
Adding the missing
fragments of the puzzle

32
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,663
would reveal whether the picture
was as he guessed it would be.

33
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:39,333
(PA) The result of the fifth
race is now declared official.

34
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,279
25 dollars.

35
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:07,285
(narrator) An hour earlier that same
afternoon, in another part of the city,

36
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:12,161
Patrolman First Class Randy Kennan had
some personal business to attend to.

37
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:14,621
Hiya, Tiny. What's the good word?

38
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:17,082
Same as always. Havin' a ball.

39
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,459
I'll see you later.

40
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:26,507
Good evening, Randy.
How've things been?

41
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:30,808
What's the use of kicking, Leo?
You wouldn't believe it anyway.

42
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,985
I supposed they were very well.
After all, a man drives a new car,

43
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:39,608
- lives in a fine apartment...
- So I like to live good. Any objections?

44
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,781
None at all.

45
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,905
If you don't overlook your obligation to
me. I trust it was purely an oversight.

46
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:52,284
I'm sure a man in your position wouldn't
deliberately antagonise his creditors.

47
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,829
I ain't got it, Leo. I know I should have it,

48
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:58,834
and I'm as anxious to pay you off as
you are to have me, but I just ain't got it.

49
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,422
Well, we all get a little
cramped now and then.

50
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:06,925
Suppose we make it a thousand. I'll
rewrite the balance as a new loan.

51
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:12,187
- Give you a fiscal breather. Fresh start.
- Leo, I'm broke. Get me? Flat broke.

52
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:16,018
Right now I don't have a thousand cents.
If you can wait a coupla weeks...

53
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:19,904
Might be arranged.
With the proper collateral, of course.

54
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:23,617
You mean "Where is the dough
comin' from?" I can't tell you.

55
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:28,041
But it's a plenty sweet deal and I'll
be able to pay out like a slot machine.

56
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,371
- Two weeks, you said. No longer?
- Maybe even less than that.

57
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:36,297
You know I wouldn't pull a thing
like this on you. I couldn't afford to.

58
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:41,219
I'm glad you said that. I was going to point
out as much, but since you relieve me

59
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:44,053
- of the unpleasant necessity...
- It's a deal, then?

60
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,510
I pay you the 2600 within two weeks?

61
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:51,059
Plus $400, a total of 3,000.
The extra interest, of course.

62
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,434
I trust that'll be satisfactory.

63
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,739
- I couldn't say no.
- Thank you, Randy.

64
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:59,190
I was sure you'd see it my way.

65
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,817
Take good care of yourself.

66
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,904
I'll take care of myself, mister.
That's my specialty.

67
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,919
At 7pm that same day, Johnny Clay,

68
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:14,922
perhaps the most important thread in the
unfinished fabric, furthered its design.

69
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:19,001
None of these men are criminals in
the usual sense. They've all got jobs,

70
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:23,682
they all live seemingly normal, decent
lives, but they got their problems

71
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,182
and they've all got a little larceny in 'em.

72
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,896
Take my pal unger, for instance,
the guy who owns this apartment.

73
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:33,975
He's putting up the money to operate with
and he's letting me stay here.

74
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:38,575
He's a book-keeper. Been with
the same company for ten years.

75
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:42,485
You know, Fay, the mistake I made
before was shooting for peanuts.

76
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:45,492
Five years have taught me
one thing, if nothing else.

77
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,543
If you take a chance,
be sure the reward's worth the risk.

78
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,419
They can put you away just as fast
for a ten-dollar heist as for a million.

79
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:57,045
You don't have to sell it to me. You know
I'll go along with anything you say.

80
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:00,346
I always have, you know,
ever since we were kids.

81
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:04,970
I've always believed you,
everything you've ever told me.

82
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:10,062
Those five years you been away, I know
they must have been terrible for you.

83
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:14,819
I mean... being locked up
must be a terrible thing.

84
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,445
You know something?
This may sound funny, but...

85
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,664
waiting for you all those years
and staying by myself,

86
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,243
it was like... not that you were locked in,

87
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,917
but I was locked out.

88
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:36,088
Look at me. First time we're together
in five years and I'm making speeches.

89
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,921
Now, now. Everything's gonna
be all right, I promise you.

90
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:44,103
Make sure you're right about it, Johnny.
I'm no good for anybody else.

91
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,105
I'm not pretty and I'm not very smart, so
please don't leave me alone any more.

92
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:52,235
Nothing is gonna happen. Not this time.

93
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:59,025
Well, I... I guess I'd better leave you be
now. I know you got a lot of work to do.

94
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:03,034
- When will I see you again?
- Saturday night.

95
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,917
We'll be on the plane together. Look, Fay,

96
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:09,045
until it's all over, I want
you to stay out of the way.

97
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:13,549
- If there's anything I can do to help...
- No. Just make the plane reservations.

98
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:17,805
And tell 'em at the office that you're
leaving. Tell 'em you're getting married.

99
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:20,303
I don't wanna say goodbye.

100
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,678
- Oh.
- Hello, Marv. We were talking about you.

101
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,387
- Hi, Johnny. Hi, Miss Fay.
- Hello.

102
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,767
- I hope it was something nice.
- Oh, yes.

103
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,773
Johnny was telling me what
a wonderful friend you were.

104
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,025
- Fay was just leaving, weren't you?
- Don't rush off on my account.

105
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,828
- She's late for an appointment.
- That's right.

106
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,663
- You'll be sure to call me, won't you?
- Yeah. I'll do just what I told you.

107
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:50,209
It was nice to see you again, Mr unger.
Take care of Johnny.

108
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,173
- There's nothing I wouldn't do for Johnny.
- I'll see you.

109
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,926
Half an hour earlier,
at approximately 6.30,

110
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:01,509
Mike O'Reilly, the track
bartender, came home.

111
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,886
Ruthie? I'm home.

112
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,803
At 7.15 that night,

113
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:45,982
George Peatty, the track cashier,
arrived at his apartment.

114
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,148
Hello.

115
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,780
Hello.

116
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,408
- Feelin' OK?
- Fine.

117
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,492
I been kinda sick. I keep
gettin' pains in my stomach.

118
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:04,329
Maybe you got a hole in it.
Do you suppose you have?

119
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:09,040
- How would I get a hole in my stomach?
- How would you get one in your head?

120
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:12,875
Fix me a drink, George. I think
I'm developing some pains myself.

121
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:16,926
Sherry, can't I say anything at all
without you joking about it?

122
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:21,387
Hurry up with that drink, George.
The pains are gettin' worse.

123
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:27,775
I saw somethin' nice comin' home on
the train tonight. Somethin' kinda sweet.

124
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:32,150
- A candy bar, George?
- No, not a candy bar, doughnut.

125
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,200
It was people.

126
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,874
This couple sittin' in front of me.

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,535
They weren't young, exactly. I guess
the woman was about your age.

128
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,048
A little senile, you mean? With
one foot and a big toe in the grave?

129
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,298
You wanna hear this or not, Sherry?

130
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,263
I can't wait. Go ahead
and thrill me, George.

131
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,763
Well, they were in front of me and I could
hear what they said. Well, part of it.

132
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:03,394
- They weren't young, exactly...
- She was about my age, you said.

133
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:07,308
Not any more. Maybe she was when
you started this story, but not now.

134
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:10,445
Anyway, she called him poppa
and he called her momma.

135
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:15,235
And the climax to this ex citing story?
The moral? The punch line, George?

136
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:19,664
Forget it, Sherry. Just thought I'd tell
you about it, but I might have known.

137
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,827
I know. You want to bet I know,
I'll give you seven to five.

138
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:25,000
Cut it out, will you, Sherry?

139
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,713
- I'm tired. I don't feel so good.
- You want me to call you poppa.

140
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:32,840
- Isn't that it? And you'd call me momma.
- You know all the answers.

141
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:36,720
Go ahead. It may be your last word,
but I'll try to kill you painlessly.

142
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,887
I gotta go out. I don't suppose
there's anything for dinner?

143
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:42,891
Of course there is.
There are all sorts of things.

144
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:46,559
- Well, steak and asparagus and potatoes.
- I don't smell nothin'.

145
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:50,063
- That figures. You're too far away from it.
- Too far away?

146
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,193
Certainly. You don't think I had it cooked,
do you? It's down the shopping centre.

147
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:59,373
Tell me something, would you,
Sherry? Just tell me one thing.

148
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,367
Why did you ever marry me anyway?

149
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:07,414
Oh, George, when a man has to ask his
wife that... He just hadn't better, that's all.

150
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,337
Why talk about it?
Maybe it's all to the good.

151
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,302
If people didn't have headaches, what
would happen to the aspirin industry?

152
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,721
You used to love me.
You said you did, anyway.

153
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:21,181
You made a memorable statement too.
Something about hitting it rich,

154
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:25,727
having an apartment on Park Avenue and
a different car for every day of the week.

155
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:30,986
Not that I care, as long as I have a big
handsome intelligent brute like you.

156
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:34,533
It would make a difference,
wouldn't it? If I had money, I mean.

157
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:39,039
How do you define money? If you mean
your collection of Roosevelt dimes...

158
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:42,203
I mean big money. Hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

159
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:45,670
You really aren't well. You sure
that pain's in your stomach?

160
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,124
I'm gonna have it. Hundreds of thousands.

161
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,344
- Maybe a half a million.
- Course you are, darling.

162
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:55,220
You put the right address on the envelope
when you sent it to the north pole?

163
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,555
Go ahead and laugh. Wait and see. You
won't be laughing so hard in a few days.

164
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:04,976
You're serious. You really think
you're gonna have a lot of money.

165
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,895
- I don't think nothin'. I know it.
- You've never been a liar, George.

166
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:11,321
You don't have enough imagination to lie.

167
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:15,034
What makes you think you'll have
several hundred thousand dollars?

168
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:17,405
Cos I do. I just can't talk about it.

169
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,874
- Not even to me?
- I shouldn't have even mentioned it.

170
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:24,454
It's not that I mind, I know I can
trust you. But these other guys...

171
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,086
- These other guys?
- I can't talk about it, Sherry. I just can't.

172
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,304
These guys, is that why you're
going out? To meet them?

173
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:36,014
They got nothing to do with that.
I just gotta go uptown for a while.

174
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:41,649
I see. Well, go ahead. If you wanna act
that way, I certainly won't try to stop you.

175
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:44,527
Sherry, no. Sherry, honey,
don't be sore at me.

176
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,061
Well, when a woman's
been married five years

177
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:51,065
and her husband doesn't trust her...
You think more of them than of me.

178
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:55,330
What right have you got to say a thing
like that? You know I'm crazy about you.

179
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:59,869
I'd do anything for you. You're the one
I'm doing it for. If I didn't love you so...

180
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:03,039
I don't want you to do anything.
I don't even wanna talk to you.

181
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:06,257
- Go see your fella, whatever you want.
- Sherry.

182
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:10,678
Don't be surprised if I'm not here when
you get home. Don't at all be surprised.

183
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:14,009
You better be here, you hear me?
You will be, won't you?

184
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:16,764
You wouldn't do anything
foolish, would you?

185
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:21,688
I wouldn't want to, but as long as you
don't trust me or have a bit of faith in me...

186
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:24,355
If I ever found you with another man...

187
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:28,152
Why? You have no use for me. You say
you do, but when it comes to a showdown

188
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:32,115
or proving it, you say one thing
then you do the opposite.

189
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,825
Well, I could tell you a little bit
about it, I guess. Well, most of it.

190
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,661
- But you have to promise to keep quiet.
- Why, of course, darling.

191
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:44,257
(buzzer)

192
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,422
Just a second.

193
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,171
- Well.
- Hello.

194
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:55,012
- How'd you get away from George?
- He had to go somewhere.

195
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,682
That's a break. I'm glad you called.

196
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,983
- Something wrong, baby?
- No, nothing's wrong.

197
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:07,905
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't think so.

198
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,529
Come on, now. That's not my baby.

199
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,367
- Val, I called you last night.
- Oh, yeah?

200
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,870
- There was no answer.
- Guess I stepped out.

201
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:20,417
- I called you four times.
- Honey, I guess I was out somewhere.

202
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,586
Oh? What'd you do?

203
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,965
I dunno, I guess I was
goofing off at the movies.

204
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:29,961
- Val, why are you doing this to me?
- I don't know what you mean.

205
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:33,930
- I think you do.
- Oh, look, Mrs Peatty.

206
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,975
What I do is my own business.
I never tried to pin you down, did I?

207
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,024
I never asked how you got
your kicks before you met me.

208
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:43,477
You didn't use to talk to me like that.

209
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:47,610
I'm sorry, baby, but don't bug me.
I gotta live my life a certain way.

210
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:52,036
- I can't stand it when the walls close in.
- But you know how crazy I am about you.

211
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:57,205
And I'm crazy about you too, sweetheart.
I've given you sufficient proof of that.

212
00:16:57,335 --> 00:17:01,629
- Well, I know, but lately every time I call...
- So I step out once in a while.

213
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:05,208
You got a husband who'll
spend every last nickel on you,

214
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:09,673
won't ask questions if you come home
from an afternoon movie at nine at night.

215
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:12,512
- Don't be greedy.
- I'm not, I'm in love with you.

216
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,721
If that's being greedy,
I'm the biggest glutton on Earth.

217
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,809
Don't make it so ominous.
It's not like you'll eat me alive.

218
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:20,981
I may just do that.

219
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:27,982
Darling, what are the two things
in life you're most interested in?

220
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,407
- What?
- Money and women?

221
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:33,787
- That's a nice way to put me down.
- Sums it up, doesn't it?

222
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:38,792
We'll let it stand, but I imagine what you
meant to say was "money and woman".

223
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:43,001
We'll have money. More money than you
ever dreamed of. Maybe even millions.

224
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:46,051
- Oh, yeah? How?
- George, that's how.

225
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,014
- He's stumbled onto something big.
- That meatball?

226
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,640
A meatball with gravy, Val.
You know he works at the track.

227
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,103
Well, somehow, don't ask me how,
he's got connected with a mob.

228
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:59,398
They're gonna rob the track
offices for the day's receipts.

229
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:03,145
He seriously told you that he and some
mob are gonna knock over the racetrack?

230
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,696
You can believe him. George
may be a fool but he's not a liar.

231
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:10,111
- He's crazy. It's never been done before.
- I know, I told him that.

232
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:13,164
But he says the job's all set up
and it's gonna be done.

233
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,620
And if I just sit tight, I'd be up to
my curls in cash, just like that.

234
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:22,004
Well, let's suppose this is
all true. How do I fit in?

235
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:26,926
Well, you know I'm gonna leave
George. I guess you know why, too.

236
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,555
You've been saying that
for a long, long time, Sherry.

237
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:34,307
Everything's changed.
I was gonna tell him tonight.

238
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:36,976
George may be very rich very soon.

239
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:40,940
- That's all he needs, isn't it?
- He'll still be George.

240
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,943
So you think, uh, let's say George and his
boys pull this job and George gets his cut.

241
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:51,027
- Maybe I could take it away from him.
- I think you could.

242
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:55,033
And the others? Any idea who they are?

243
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,751
Only this. I went through
his clothes while he was showering.

244
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,882
I'm quite sure George went there tonight.

245
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:06,514
Kiddo, I think we got somethin' here.

246
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,973
You know, if this is true, this
is a lot bigger than you think.

247
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,592
You're interested in takin' George's cut?

248
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:15,564
It's gonna be peanuts
compared to this whole thing.

249
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,902
We gotta find out more about the overall
plan. You think he'd tell you any more?

250
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:24,073
Not a chance. He was scared stiff
cos he talked as much as he did.

251
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,616
I don't get it, Johnny,
about these two other guys.

252
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:33,833
You mean they're gonna be in on the deal,
and we ain't gonna know who they are?

253
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,836
That's right. And they don't know who you
are. That makes sense to you, doesn't it?

254
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:42,299
- Yes, I guess so, but...
- It makes sense to me all right.

255
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:46,176
- How come we need 'em, though?
- One of them's for the job with the rifle.

256
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:50,600
None of you could do it, even if you were
willing. The other starts a fight in the bar.

257
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:54,808
What are they cutting in for? Not that
I mind, anything you do is OK, but...

258
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,480
They're not in on the scheme. They get
paid to do certain duties at a certain time.

259
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,907
And they're not cutting in on the take.
They get a flat price for a straight job.

260
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:08,653
If they don't know about the basic plan,
the job, why are they doin' it?

261
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:12,572
They're straight hoods, paid in advance.
Five grand for the one with the rifle,

262
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,876
- 2500 for the other.
- Where's this money comin' from?

263
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:20,713
That's where Marvin comes in. He gets
us the 7500 and gets it back off the top.

264
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:25,505
Wish I could do more. It's almost not right
for me to get as much as everybody else.

265
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:28,724
- After all, all I do is...
- Your money counts for plenty, Marv.

266
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:32,801
- You don't hear them complaining.
- Sure. You're OK in our book, Marv.

267
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:37,731
But if these hoods get paid in advance,
how do you know they'll do their jobs?

268
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,775
I'll vouch for 'em. They're pros.
They can't afford to weasel out on a deal.

269
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,952
If they did, they'd be washed up.
OK? Any other questions?

270
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,160
Well, let's take a look at this, then.

271
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,123
This is a rough drawing of
the track as I remember it.

272
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,170
Randy, you'll have to get me an
A1 street map of the whole district.

273
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:02,511
George, Mike, I want you to go over
this thing with me inch by inch.

274
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,840
Bring it up to date, add or
subtract the slightest change,

275
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,509
even something as small as
the placing of a hot-dog stand.

276
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,183
Now, give or take a few thousand,

277
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,517
I figure the loot on this deal at two million.

278
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,067
There should be that much in the offices.

279
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:22,696
That includes profits on
pari-mutuel betting, breakage money,

280
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:28,330
taxes from the mutuel machines, receipts
from concessions and the ticket sales.

281
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:32,075
None of this money is allowed to
accumulate at any point on the track.

282
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,038
Ex cept for change and the mutuel clerk's
payoff money, it all goes into the office.

283
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:42,381
Out of the entire take, only a few thousand
dollars is put in the safe for emergencies.

284
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:45,798
The rest is out in the open,
held for pick-up by armoured car.

285
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:50,679
That car arrives about five o'clock and
parks directly in front of the clubhouse.

286
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:54,514
Two men stay in it. One at the wheel,
one at a machine gun in the turret.

287
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:57,605
Two others collect the dough.
They're armed, of course.

288
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:01,189
So are the track detectives who
cover them from the car to the office.

289
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:05,453
- Once the car arrives, a stick-up is...
- (clatter)

290
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,117
Is out of the question.

291
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,716
(door opens/woman gasps)

292
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,431
(thud)

293
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:37,063
(Randy) Say, what in the name of Pete
would a babe be doing outside that door?

294
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:41,774
(Johnny) What do you think? You guys,
any of you ever see this woman before?

295
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:46,287
- It's Sherry, my wife.
- You been talking. You spilled to her.

296
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:48,987
I didn't. What, do you think
I'm crazy? I wouldn't...

297
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,874
You jerk! You clown! Come on, clown,
sing us a chorus from Pagliacci.

298
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,089
You better talk, George,
or we'll get it out of her.

299
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:58,885
Please, you wouldn't do
anything to hurt her? Please.

300
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,340
- If you won't say what you told her...
- I didn't tell her nothin', honest I didn't.

301
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:06,594
- Why would I do a thing like that?
- Sure you wouldn't.

302
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:11,105
She's a building inspector. Just stopped
there to measure the keyhole. Why, you...

303
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:14,767
Let's have it. We'll get it out of
one of you. If you didn't tell her,

304
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:17,690
why was she around here snoopin'?

305
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:21,191
She must have found the address
in my pocket. Sure, that's it.

306
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:25,110
Thought I was two-timing her,
runnin' around with another...

307
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:28,580
Of course. She's just
checkin' up on me, John.

308
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:34,954
I ain't done nothin', honest I didn't.

309
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,088
You'll let her go, won't you?
You won't hurt her, John?

310
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,052
Randy? Mike? Take him to his apartment
and stick with him until I phone.

311
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:46,267
- No, I'm not leaving Sherry!
- You're leavin' all right.

312
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:50,772
- How are you goin'? Slidin' or walkin'?
- Come on, George, let's go.

313
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:57,072
What are you gonna do now, Johnny?

314
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,986
Ah, I don't think I'll have to kill her. Just
slap that pretty face into hamburger meat.

315
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:06,321
Marv, take yourself
a walk for an hour or so.

316
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:10,075
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll be
back in a couple of hours.

317
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,713
All right, sister, that's a pretty
head you got on your shoulders.

318
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:58,713
You wanna keep it there or
carry it around in your hands?

319
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:02,678
We could compromise and put it on
your shoulder. I think that'd be nice.

320
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:06,889
- What were you doing outside that door?
- Doing? I was listening, naturally.

321
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:10,640
- Trying to, I should say.
- You admit you were out there snooping?

322
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,979
Yes. Wasn't that naughty of me?
But I'm afraid I was.

323
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,573
I found an address in George's pocket.
I thought he was playing around, so I...

324
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,991
And you'd care if he was playin'
another dame? That would bother you?

325
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,455
You don't understand me, Johnny.
You don't know me very well.

326
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:32,002
I know you like a book. You're
a no-good nosey little tramp.

327
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,465
You'd sell out your mother for
a piece of fudge, but you're smart.

328
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:39,045
You know when to sell, when to sit tight.
You know to sit tight now.

329
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,718
- I do?
- You heard me. You like money.

330
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,100
You got a big dollar sign where
most women have a heart.

331
00:25:45,228 --> 00:25:49,606
So play it smart and you'll have money.
George'll have it and he'll blow it on you.

332
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:54,561
- Probably buy himself a five-cent cigar.
- You don't know me very well, Johnny.

333
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:58,909
I wouldn't think of letting George
throw his money away on cigars.

334
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:03,282
- Isn't there a big "if" in there somewhere?
- Yeah, there's a couple of 'em.

335
00:26:03,414 --> 00:26:07,662
If you're smart, keep your trap shut and
don't nose around, you'll have money.

336
00:26:07,794 --> 00:26:12,540
You'll be loaded. If you don't, we'll forget
the whole thing. You won't have a penny.

337
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:16,886
I wouldn't like that and, frail as I am,
I'd much prefer to be loaded.

338
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:20,262
I think we understand
each other. Now beat it.

339
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,721
Those guys.
Fine friends they turned out to be.

340
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:27,345
Slappin' me around,
callin' me dirty names.

341
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:30,352
I thought that rotten Randy
would cave my head in.

342
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:33,356
Poor George.
You're all right now, aren't you?

343
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:37,782
Doggone it, you shouldn't have come over
there. It's a wonder we didn't get killed.

344
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:42,488
There wasn't much danger of that. If they
killed you there couldn't be a robbery.

345
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:45,410
They did anything to harm me,
it would offend you...

346
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,915
They have offended me.
Offended me plenty.

347
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:52,423
- George, don't be such an old bear.
- They have, and I won't forget in a hurry.

348
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,129
What else could they have done?
I thought they acted quite reasonably.

349
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:59,173
Well, anyway...

350
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:02,012
What... What did Johnny do to you?

351
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,221
Do? I already told you.
Just asked me some questions

352
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:08,894
and made sure it was
all right for me to leave.

353
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:14,151
- Sherry, did Johnny try anything?
- George, what a terrible thing to ask.

354
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:17,152
- I was sure you wouldn't.
- You'd better not say any more.

355
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:20,488
Why did you come over there?
It wasn't for the reason you said.

356
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:23,373
It was for the reason you said.
You said it yourself.

357
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:27,200
I was making an alibi for you.
I was afraid those guys'd kill you.

358
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:31,714
You know I wouldn't look at another
woman. No women would chase after me.

359
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:36,385
Oh, let's drop it. You put words in my
mouth, then you say they're not true.

360
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:39,301
I told you exactly what happened.

361
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:43,810
Oh, dear. Everything's all right
with you and your pals now.

362
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:47,437
- You're gonna have lots of money and...
- I been thinkin' it over.

363
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:50,852
I can hardly wait. How soon
will it be, George? What day?

364
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,739
It ain't going to be, Sherry.
I'm droppin' out.

365
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:57,614
You're dropping...? Oh, you
don't mean it. You can't mean it.

366
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:02,074
I'm afraid, Sherry. This business
tonight, it kinda opened my eyes.

367
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:06,122
It made me realise the kind of
guys I was gettin' mixed up with.

368
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:10,500
- Before, all I thought of was the money.
- You just keep on thinking about that.

369
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:14,333
Think how disappointed I'd be
if you didn't get that money.

370
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,595
I'd feel like you didn't really love me.
I don't see how I could feel any other way.

371
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:24,269
Why? Why should I have to do a thing
like that to prove to you that I love you?

372
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:27,482
George, what are you gonna do?
I wanna know right now.

373
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:32,734
All you ever do is talk about loving me.
That's all I've had for the last five years.

374
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:37,693
Now you have a chance to do something
and to... all those things you promised,

375
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:40,699
buy me things... Well,
what are you gonna do?

376
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,998
You know there ain't a thing
in the world I wouldn't do for you.

377
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:47,044
Then you'll do this for me, won't you?

378
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,668
- I guess so.
- lt'll be perfect.

379
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:56,342
You have no idea how perfect.

380
00:28:56,473 --> 00:29:00,685
I won't have long to wait, will I? It will
be within the next few days, won't it?

381
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:03,847
- When will it be, George?
- You got your own way, Sherry.

382
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:08,228
You want me to go ahead with the deal,
so I am. Now leave me alone, will you?

383
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:13,402
I'm sorry, darling. Of course. We won't
even talk about it if you don't want to.

384
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:17,198
- You really love me, Sherry?
- Of course.

385
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:21,161
- You'll always love me?
- Always and always.

386
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,291
Three days later, at 10.15 on a Tuesday,

387
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:35,797
Johnny Clay began the final preparations.

388
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:43,722
- You want somebody to play with?
- No, thanks. I'm lookin' for a friend.

389
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,860
Oh, you pizda. You missed a move.
Knight to knight five, pawn takes knight,

390
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,609
rook takes rook, queen
to rook four, check...

391
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,236
Go bother someone else! He couldn't do
that. You don't know what you're talking.

392
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,659
Shut up, pizda. Make a move.

393
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:01,956
- He's right. I could have won your rook.
- Move, pizda.

394
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:06,082
Look, stop talking or I'll call Fisher.
I can't think with this noise!

395
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:08,253
Good game, Maurice?

396
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:12,760
- Johnny, my old friend. How are you?
- Good to see you. Been a long time, eh?

397
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:15,343
- How long have you been out?
- Not long.

398
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:18,724
- It was difficult, no?
- Yeah.

399
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:23,226
- Very difficult.
- You have my sympathies, Johnny.

400
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:26,808
You have not yet learned that
you have to be like everyone else.

401
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:30,028
The perfect mediocrity.
No better, no worse.

402
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:34,319
Individuality is a monster, and
it must be strangled in its cradle

403
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:36,777
to make our friends feel comfortable.

404
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:40,614
You know, I often thought
that the gangster and the artist

405
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,158
are the same in the eyes of the masses.

406
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:47,245
They're admired and hero-worshipped,
but there is always present

407
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:51,250
underlying wish to see them
destroyed at the peak of their glory.

408
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:55,135
Yeah. Like the... Like the man said,

409
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:57,887
"Life is like a glass of tea."

410
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,684
Oh, Johnny, my friend,
you never were very bright.

411
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:04,352
But I love you anyway.

412
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:06,726
How's life been treating you, Maurice?

413
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:12,862
About the same as always. When I need
some money, I go out and wrestle.

414
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:16,279
But mostly I'm up here,
wasting my time playing chess.

415
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:21,870
But I wouldn't know what to do with
myself if I didn't have this place to go to.

416
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:24,873
Maurice, could you use 2500 dollars?

417
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:30,047
It does have a nice ring to the ear.
Quite musical. What is it for?

418
00:31:30,178 --> 00:31:34,010
For taking care of half a dozen
private dicks. Racetrack cops.

419
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,344
Start a fight with the bartender.
The track cops will break it up.

420
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:42,270
You keep 'em busy, make 'em drag you
out. No gunplay, strictly a muscle job.

421
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,444
Would it be out of order for me to ask
why you would pay such a price

422
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,646
to see me demonstrate my talents?

423
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:53,277
I would imagine... it is for more than
just your personal entertainment.

424
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,243
$2500 is a lot of dough, Maurice.
Part of it's for not asking questions.

425
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:01,418
That sounds not unreasonable.
Still, I will probably go to jail,

426
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,249
and jails I have found unpleasant.

427
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:08,379
Food is very bad, company
is poor, beds are too small...

428
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,093
It'll only be a disorderly conduct
charge. Maybe 60 days, no worse.

429
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:16,090
And if a man has a little money to
spread around, he'll be comfortable.

430
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,184
I do not quite understand, Johnny.

431
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:22,606
For what you want me to do, you could
get any hoodlum for a hundred dollars.

432
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:26,814
I don't want any hoodlum. I want a guy
like you, someone who's dependable,

433
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,280
who knows he's paid to take a risk
and won't squawk if it gets rough.

434
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:34,157
I was thinking if perhaps we can
work out some other arrangement.

435
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,743
2500 I like very much.

436
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,621
But suppose I were
willing to forgo part of it

437
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:44,129
and take a share in your...
enterprise instead. No?

438
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,747
No. It's not mine to share up.

439
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:50,585
Very well, Johnny. I sense there
will be certain details to work out.

440
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:53,391
Yeah. I'll buy you a cup of coffee, huh?

441
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:02,893
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah, exactly what I wanted.

442
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:07,190
You could take care of a roomful of
people with that. Maybe not kill 'em all,

443
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:11,985
- but they wouldn't do much afterwards.
- I knew you'd take care of it, Nicky.

444
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,239
- How long you had this place?
- Almost a year.

445
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:18,160
Picturesque, but there
can't be much profit in it.

446
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:23,168
There isn't. But there isn't much trouble
neither. What are you thinkin' about?

447
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:26,501
A job. Your kind of a job. A job with a rifle.

448
00:33:26,635 --> 00:33:29,256
- What kind of money, pops?
- 5,000.

449
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,378
- Who do I have to kill?
- A horse.

450
00:33:32,516 --> 00:33:34,343
- A horse?
- A four-legged horse.

451
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:37,513
- And for that I get 5,000?
- Well, for that and...

452
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:42,024
- I figured there'd be a gimmick.
- It's not as tough as you may think.

453
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:45,603
You shoot the horse and if anything
goes wrong, you don't squawk.

454
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:49,985
- All I gotta do is bump off a horse?
- It's a special kind of a horse, Nick.

455
00:33:50,118 --> 00:33:52,870
For certain reasons,
including your protection,

456
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:55,783
I won't give you the whole story,
just your part of it.

457
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:59,996
Next Saturday is the $100,000 handicap.
In the seventh race, the big race,

458
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:04,173
a certain horse is running. The best
three-year-old to come along in years.

459
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,250
He's a winner and won't pay even money
cos half the people will be down on him.

460
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:12,337
There's a parking lot 300 feet from
the northwest corner of the track.

461
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:16,058
From a car parked in the corner of
that lot, you get a view of the horses

462
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,809
as they come around
and start into the stretch.

463
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,068
A man in a car parked there using a
high-powered rifle with a telescopic sight

464
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,686
could bring down
any horse with a single shot.

465
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:28,658
A man with your eye
would hardly need a sight.

466
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:32,402
That horse is worth quarter of a million,
and the crowd would go nuts.

467
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:37,781
Let 'em. You can do it, and you'd have
no trouble getting away in the confusion.

468
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,169
Red Lightning will be leading
in the stretch. So he goes down,

469
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:45,876
a couple of other horses pile up on top
of him. There'll be plenty of confusion.

470
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,925
One more thing. Suppose by accident you
do get picked up. What have you done?

471
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:53,426
You shot a horse. It isn't murder,
in fact I don't know what it is,

472
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,012
but the best thing they could get
you on would be inciting a riot,

473
00:34:57,147 --> 00:35:02,142
- or shooting horses out of season.
- You make it sound real simple, pops.

474
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:05,528
5,000 bucks for rubbin' out a horse.

475
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:09,989
- OK, pops, how do I get it?
- 2500 today, 2500 the day after the race.

476
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,405
OK. Crazy. Now, tell me,
what's your angle, John?

477
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,585
They'll probably call the race off,
and not pay off any of the bets?

478
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:20,463
Maybe, but what my
angle is is my business.

479
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:25,381
5,000 bucks is a lot, and that's why I'm
paying it. So nobody knows my business.

480
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:29,425
All right, John. You ain't gonna get
no trouble with me. I'm with you.

481
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:46,397
- I'm lookin' for Joe Piano.
- Who's lookin'?

482
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:47,992
- Patsy sent me.
- Patsy who?

483
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:50,194
- Patsy Gennelli.
- Where did you see Patsy?

484
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,368
Alcatraz. We roomed together. My name...

485
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:55,119
Don't tell me who you are.
What can I do for you?

486
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:58,951
I want a place to stay for a week. I won't
be in it much, I don't want it cleaned

487
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:02,837
- and I want anybody in it ex cept myself.
- I think I can accommodate you.

488
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:06,052
- So how's the boy?
- He's fine. He's doing it on his ear.

489
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:08,218
- He's the best pitcher they got.
- I know.

490
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:12,262
- He said not to worry about him.
- He's doing the book. I worry plenty.

491
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:16,605
- He's tough, maybe he'll get a break.
- Yeah, I know. Let's hope.

492
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,519
There. I got another one. Don't worry
about leaving anything here.

493
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:24,904
It'll be safe. I'm always over here.
There'll be no maid service.

494
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:28,117
- You wanna leave anything?
- This, and another bag next week.

495
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:31,115
- Don't worry. Nobody will disturb them.
- What'll it be?

496
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:35,162
- Oh, no, no. No charge. Patsy sent you.
- Sure he sent me, but he's a friend.

497
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,793
I'd feel better if I paid. A business
arrangement. I can afford it.

498
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:42,172
- OK, then. It'll be ten dollars a week.
- All right.

499
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,675
I'll send the money in the bus to the boy.
Thank you very much. Have a nice time.

500
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:28,847
Four days later, at 7.30am,
Sherry Peatty was wide awake.

501
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:44,698
- Gosh, honey, did I wake you? I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

502
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:48,657
- I couldn't sleep.
- Can I get you anything? More coffee?

503
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:52,157
No, I guess not.
Nice of you to offer, though.

504
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:56,621
I don't know, I'm just restless. I'll be
all right. Go on back to bed, will you?

505
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:00,289
I won't. Even if I don't get up
to get my husband's breakfast,

506
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:03,260
the least I can do is sit with him
while he has his coffee.

507
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:05,794
Sherry, are you sure you feel all right?

508
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:08,552
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

509
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:10,842
I deserved it.

510
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:15,106
I know I've been irritable and moody
lately and I haven't acted like I should.

511
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:19,978
It's just I can't stand living like this. This
crummy apartment, hamburger for dinner.

512
00:38:20,113 --> 00:38:23,197
- You haven't been so bad, baby.
- Yes, I have.

513
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:27,951
Things are gonna be different. When we
get all that money and have nice things,

514
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,907
I'll stop thinking about myself so much.
Your problems will be my problems.

515
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:37,586
Whenever you're worried, like now. Is it
the robbery that you're worried about?

516
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:42,128
Yeah, I guess. Just a little. Oh, I have no
reason to. I know it's gonna be all right.

517
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:45,677
It's natural you'd be
upset at a time like this.

518
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,258
It's today, isn't it?

519
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:53,142
What makes you think that? Just because
I couldn't sleep, it doesn't mean...

520
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:57,057
I know my Georgie. He can't fool me.
I'm right, aren't l, darling?

521
00:38:57,194 --> 00:39:01,144
- Today is the day we get all that money?
- No, you ain't. It isn't today.

522
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:06,157
If you don't stop pestering me, trying to
find out, there ain't gonna be no money.

523
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:09,786
- But George, how can you...?
- I mean it, Sherry. I'm gettin' fed up.

524
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:14,412
You heard what Johnny told you. Stop
butting in, or he'll call the whole thing off.

525
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:17,749
He told me something else,
which I neglected to tell you.

526
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:21,583
That if I did butt in, as you and he
choose to call it, he'd break my neck.

527
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,845
Maybe he had reason to. He wanted to
make you understand he means business.

528
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:29,680
All I've got to say is,
you've changed your tune

529
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:32,599
since he and his friends
slapped you around.

530
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:35,104
I was sore about that,
but what could they do?

531
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:38,520
You said they acted reasonable.
We had no reason to hold a grudge.

532
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:41,691
I'm not gonna argue with you.
If you let people beat you up,

533
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:46,237
- then take their side against your wife...
- But you did! I wanted to quit.

534
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:49,158
You wouldn't let me.
You said I had no reason to.

535
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:53,703
Anyway, Johnny didn't lay a hand on me.
None of the guys did but Randy.

536
00:39:53,837 --> 00:39:56,458
I was gonna tell you
something about Johnny,

537
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,588
but since you feel about him like
you do, take his word against mine...

538
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,136
What about him?
What were you gonna tell me?

539
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:09,933
- Let's stop the conversation right there.
- What were you gonna tell me, Sherry?

540
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:13,977
I don't think I can tell you when
you feel like you do about him.

541
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:17,442
Not havin' any faith in me,
and keepin' secrets.

542
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,690
We won't have any secrets.
What happened?

543
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:25,111
Well, I tried to tell you about
this the other night, but...

544
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:29,160
you were so upset, and every time
I tried to say anything you cut me off.

545
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:32,209
Sherry, what are you trying to tell me?

546
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:36,586
I tried to stop him.
I pleaded and I struggled.

547
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:45,177
It doesn't matter, does it? The only thing
that matters is how I feel about you now.

548
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:49,639
It is today, isn't it?

549
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,361
Earlier that morning, at 5am, Red
Lightning was fed a half portion of feed

550
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:02,862
in preparation for the seventh race that
day, the $100,000 Lansdowne Stakes.

551
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:11,079
At seven that morning Johnny Clay began
what might be the last day of his life.

552
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:13,369
Yeah, all right, all right.

553
00:41:16,758 --> 00:41:19,000
- What time is it?
- It's early yet. Only seven.

554
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:23,763
You better go back to sleep after
I leave. I just wanted to say goodbye.

555
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:29,134
Till tonight, that is. Everything's all set.
Should go perfectly, but if it doesn't,

556
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:33,898
don't talk about it. You're in the clear for
everything but being short on your books.

557
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:36,944
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

558
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:41,200
In fact, I'm not worried about anything.
I just wish there was more I could do.

559
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:44,778
You've done your part.
I only hope we can do ours as well.

560
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:49,540
We... we'll probably never see each other
again after we split the money tonight,

561
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:52,918
but... in my book you'll
always be a stand-up guy.

562
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:57,299
Johnny, I... I don't know how to say this,

563
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:00,262
and I don't even know
if I have the right, but...

564
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:03,472
I've always thought maybe
you're like my own kid.

565
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,763
- Ah, you can say anything you want.
- You've had a lot of rough breaks.

566
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:12,688
Maybe you've made a few mistakes,
but after today, the good Lord willing,

567
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:15,902
you'll be a new man. A rich man.

568
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:18,777
And that can make a lot of difference.

569
00:42:18,908 --> 00:42:23,036
You got a lot of life ahead of you,
a lot of people to meet.

570
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:27,658
- People of quality and substance.
- What are you gettin' at?

571
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,627
Wouldn't it be great if we
could go away, the two of us,

572
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:34,123
and let the old world
take a couple of turns

573
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:37,424
and have a chance
to take stock of things?

574
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:43,344
It can be pretty serious and terrible,
particularly if it's not the right person.

575
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:46,346
Getting married, I mean.

576
00:42:46,478 --> 00:42:48,767
You better go back to sleep.

577
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:53,026
The seventh race starts about 4.30
if you want to catch it on the radio.

578
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:55,822
I'll be back here about seven o'clock.

579
00:42:58,741 --> 00:43:03,238
Keep away from the track. Go to
a movie or something. See you later.

580
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,459
It was exactly 7 am
when he got to the airport.

581
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,379
The weight is OK, Mr Preston.
Is that all the baggage?

582
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,926
I'll have one more tonight. I can
keep that in the cabin, can't I?

583
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:25,477
Yes, sir, but be sure and check in before
flight time. Flight 465 leaves at 9pm.

584
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,688
- Thank you.
- Thank you for flying American, sir.

585
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:38,030
Stopping first at a florist, he arrived at
the motel at 8.15. He was on schedule.

586
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,530
- Good morning, my friend.
- Morning, Joe. Now, look.

587
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,114
This afternoon a friend of mine will
leave a bundle for me. He's a cop.

588
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:48,001
- A cop?
- Yeah, yeah. He drives a prowl car.

589
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:51,377
- Funny kind of a friend to have.
- He's a funny kind of a cop.

590
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:55,171
Let him in. He'll leave this bundle
for me about 6.30. I'll pick it up.

591
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:58,053
- That's the last you'll see of me.
- Come in for a drink.

592
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:01,050
I got a lot to do today.
Everything would be fouled up.

593
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:05,512
I understand. I'll see you tonight.
So long. Take care of yourself.

594
00:44:50,026 --> 00:44:53,395
He reached the bus station at 8.45.

595
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:26,512
At 9.20 he arrived at Mike's apartment.
Everything had gone according to plan.

596
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:37,491
Mike O'Reilly was ready at 11.15.

597
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:41,866
What goes on here?
This is no way to get your strength back.

598
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:45,497
It's very good, Mike, but
I guess I'm just not hungry.

599
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:49,755
- Really, I couldn't eat another bite.
- Another? You haven't eaten anything.

600
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:54,959
I'll take something after a while. After I've
had my medicine I'll have more appetite.

601
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:58,547
- That's a promise? No tricks now?
- It's a promise.

602
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:02,632
- Go along now. You'll be late for work.
- Yeah, I guess I will.

603
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:06,808
Ruthie, things are gonna
get much better for us.

604
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:09,563
I know. I know, dear.

605
00:46:09,694 --> 00:46:14,736
I know I've made a lot of promises in
the past, but this time it's not just talk.

606
00:46:14,866 --> 00:46:19,694
We'll be rich, and soon. We'll have a fine
house, and doctors to make you well.

607
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,281
Of course, dear, but you'd
better go along or you'll be late.

608
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,457
Yeah.

609
00:46:28,422 --> 00:46:29,881
- Mike?
- Yes?

610
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,581
On your way home, would you
bring me some magazines?

611
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:37,345
Of course. But, uh, Ruthie,
I'm gonna be a little late.

612
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:41,388
Probably about ten. Some fellas and
me are having a little get-together.

613
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,304
I understand. Don't you
drink too much beer, mind.

614
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,106
- Remember how it leaves you next day.
- Don't worry about that.

615
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:51,359
I won't be doing any drinking tonight.

616
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:57,277
I called Mother. She'll be
over later to fix your dinner.

617
00:46:57,411 --> 00:46:59,700
Thank you, dear.

618
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:03,540
- Goodbye.
- Don't forget to eat your breakfast.

619
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:30,275
He reached the bus station at 11.29.

620
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:04,857
At 12.10, as it was his custom,
he arrived at the track.

621
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:17,954
(wolf-whistles)

622
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,284
- Who's the girlfriend, Mike?
- That's how you spend your money?

623
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:25,367
You blow your money on dames? An
old man like you ought to know better.

624
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:28,838
I ain't like you guys.
These posies are for my wife.

625
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:32,550
Besides, where do you guys
get off calling me an old man?

626
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:37,511
(first man) Buy flowers after work, Mike,
or they'll wilt before you get home.

627
00:48:37,643 --> 00:48:41,806
(Mike) It can't be helped.
After work the shops will all be closed.

628
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:43,563
(second man) Put 'em in water.

629
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:47,190
The clubhouse steward would
put 'em in the refrigerator for you.

630
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,898
Well, perhaps I should, but, well,
it's getting kinda late now, and...

631
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:54,951
- I'm all dressed. Why don't I do it for you?
- No.

632
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:57,367
What's the matter? I'm doin' you a favour.

633
00:48:57,497 --> 00:49:01,246
These flowers are going in my locker,
then I'll know where they are.

634
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:05,623
- OK, Mike. Suit yourself.
- Sorry, Bill. I appreciate your offer.

635
00:49:05,756 --> 00:49:11,130
After work, you know how it is. Everybody
will be in a hurry to get away, and...

636
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:56,642
(PA) ...is third, and Comfort King.
It is My Baby leading by a length.

637
00:49:56,768 --> 00:50:01,763
Concentrator is second by three quarters
of a length. Second Ending, moving up,

638
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,472
is third, and Comfort King.

639
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:08,228
It is My Baby, Concentrator
and Second Ending.

640
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:11,531
It is Second Ending,
Concentrator and Comfort King.

641
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:16,998
Second Ending in front. Down to the wire,
it's Second Ending the winner by a length,

642
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:21,785
Concentrator second by two,
Comfort King third and My Baby.

643
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:27,216
The result of the first race now
appears on the totalizator board.

644
00:50:27,342 --> 00:50:32,764
Be sure to hold all tickets until the
result of the race is declared official.

645
00:50:33,641 --> 00:50:36,808
(narrator) After the first race,
Mike was very busy.

646
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:50,406
Gimme a double bourbon, please.

647
00:50:51,076 --> 00:50:53,614
Don't you think you've had enough, pal?

648
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:03,377
(PA) Your attention please. The horses
are now on the track for the second race.

649
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:06,170
(narrator) At exactly 3.32
that same afternoon,

650
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,168
Officer Randy Kennan set in
motion his phase of the operation.

651
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:17,137
Hello, Fred. This is Randy. Listen,
check with the dispatcher's office,

652
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,185
see if they're getting me loud and
clear. I think my set's on the blink.

653
00:51:21,316 --> 00:51:23,356
Sure.

654
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:29,651
Huh? What? He says it's OK?

655
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:32,817
That's funny, it keeps going dead.

656
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:36,157
I don't think it's the tubes.
I'll keep fooling around with it.

657
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,703
Give my regards to your missus. By the
way, when's the big day supposed to be?

658
00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:44,917
Well, don't worry about it.
The sixth one is always the hardest.

659
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,559
Officer!

660
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,353
Officer!

661
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:06,905
Thank heaven. Hurry! Come quick, they're
killing each other! I always knew they...

662
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:13,329
He had timed the trip to
the track half a dozen times

663
00:52:13,455 --> 00:52:16,789
and knew at just what point
he should be at precisely what time.

664
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:19,835
He knew the success of the plan
depended on his accuracy

665
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:22,500
in arriving at the track
at the correct moment.

666
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:27,092
A minute or two early was allowable,
but ten seconds late would be fatal.

667
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,337
(PA) Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

668
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:34,008
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,

669
00:52:34,143 --> 00:52:38,770
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.

670
00:53:04,843 --> 00:53:09,801
They're off and running. At the start
it is Red Lightning breaking on top.

671
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:14,179
Early Streak is second. I'm Hoping
is third. White Fire is fourth.

672
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:18,180
(narrator) Earlier that afternoon at 2.30,
Maurice was at the chess club.

673
00:53:18,315 --> 00:53:24,105
He was to be at the track at four o'clock,
just before the start of the seventh race.

674
00:53:26,616 --> 00:53:30,530
Fisher? I am supposed to be
back here tonight about 6.30.

675
00:53:30,662 --> 00:53:33,034
If I'm not, I'd like you
to do something for me.

676
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:34,991
Sure, Maurice. What is it?

677
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:40,879
Call this number and ask for Mr Stillman.
Tell him Maurice requires his services.

678
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:43,960
Sounds pretty mysterious.
What's it all about?

679
00:53:44,093 --> 00:53:48,091
There are some things, my dear Fisher,
which do not bear looking into.

680
00:53:48,222 --> 00:53:52,968
You know of the Siberian goat herder who
tried to discover the nature of the sun?

681
00:53:53,102 --> 00:53:56,886
He stared up at the heavenly
body until it made him blind.

682
00:53:57,023 --> 00:54:01,317
There are many things like this, including
love, death and my business for today.

683
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:04,529
Please remember to make
that call if I'm not back at 6.30.

684
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:08,156
(PA) Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

685
00:54:08,285 --> 00:54:11,619
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,

686
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:16,041
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.

687
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,995
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

688
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,796
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,

689
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:28,221
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.

690
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,783
- Bottle of beer.
- Yes, sir.

691
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:57,743
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

692
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,877
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

693
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:08,594
The horses are at the gate.

694
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:12,097
The horses are at the gate.

695
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:28,238
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig?

696
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,039
What's the matter with...

697
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,493
(whistle)

698
00:56:56,297 --> 00:56:59,333
C'mon, break it up. Look out.

699
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:05,595
(narrator) It was exactly 4.23
when they dragged Maurice out.

700
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:09,468
At 11.40 that morning,
Nicky left his farm.

701
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:25,279
He arrived at the track at 12.30.

702
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:35,913
- Hi there.
- use the other lot. This ain't open yet.

703
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:38,669
- I don't like to trouble you...
- You're not.

704
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,635
I said there's no parking
here and that's that.

705
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:47,515
Look, mac, I'm a paraplegic. I want to get
in this lot to watch the race from my car.

706
00:57:47,643 --> 00:57:52,982
That ain't my problem, mister. My leg's
bum too but nobody feels sorry for me.

707
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,562
I know what you mean, buddy.

708
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:59,778
- Get that in the war?
- Battle of the Bulge.

709
00:57:59,906 --> 00:58:04,117
Say, look, I know this is a lot of
extra trouble for you. I want you to...

710
00:58:04,244 --> 00:58:07,862
- No, no. Skip it, skip it.
- I want you to take it.

711
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:10,536
Go on, keep it.

712
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:12,911
It's all right.

713
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:16,248
- Thanks a lot, mister. I'm sorry...
- That's OK. Forget it.

714
00:58:16,382 --> 00:58:20,960
Will you take down that fence? I'd like
to get settled before the first race starts.

715
00:58:21,095 --> 00:58:23,301
- OK?
- Sure, mister.

716
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,042
(PA) Your attention, please. The horses
are on the track for the second race.

717
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,886
I had this layin' around, mister.
I thought you might like it.

718
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:06,051
- Thanks. That's very kind of you.
- No trouble at all.

719
00:59:06,184 --> 00:59:09,719
- If you need anything else, just call.
- I doubt I'll need anything,

720
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:12,939
I'm getting along just fine,
but thanks anyway.

721
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:15,474
Who you bettin' on?
Anything look good to you?

722
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:17,355
- Red Lightning.
- Huh?

723
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:21,023
- Red Lightning in the seventh.
- You're bettin' on him, huh?

724
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,531
Yeah, I got a little bet down on him.

725
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:26,413
Well, I guess I better
be getting back to work.

726
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:29,825
- Thanks for bringin' me the programme.
- No trouble at all.

727
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,376
- There's nothing else I can do for you?
- No, nothing at all.

728
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:36,589
If I think of anything, I'll give you a yell.

729
00:59:59,324 --> 01:00:01,613
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

730
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:05,326
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,

731
01:00:05,456 --> 01:00:09,667
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.

732
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,670
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

733
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:35,859
- Sure is a nice day, ain't it?
- Yeah.

734
01:00:35,988 --> 01:00:40,235
I didn't think it would be when I got up
this morning but it turned out real fine.

735
01:00:40,368 --> 01:00:45,528
Kinda funny if you look at it. Weather's
like it always is this time of year, but...

736
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,994
I sure appreciate the way
you treated me, mister.

737
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:53,212
It's not the money.
Of course, I appreciate that too, but...

738
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,587
- Forget it.
- No, sir. I don't reckon I'll ever forget it.

739
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:02,173
I brought you some luck. You bet
in this race, you might need it.

740
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:05,178
Keep your junk and
leave me alone, will you?

741
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:07,185
Something wrong?

742
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:09,471
You're wrong, nigger.

743
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:12,857
Be a nice guy and go on
about your business.

744
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:16,686
Sure, boss. Sorry to have bothered you(!)

745
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:19,488
My mistake.

746
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:35,791
And they're off and running! At the
start it is Red Lightning breaking on top.

747
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:40,221
Early Streak is second. I'm Hoping
is third. White Fire is fourth.

748
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:44,132
Little Arnie is next, Seymour's
Darling, and Best Seller.

749
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:48,017
Down the back stretch, it's Red
Lightning by a length and a quarter.

750
01:01:48,148 --> 01:01:51,065
I'm Hoping is second by
three quarters of a length.

751
01:01:51,193 --> 01:01:55,487
Little Arnie is third by a length
and a quarter, and Seymour's Darling.

752
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:59,697
At the half-mile post, it is Red
Lightning by a length and a quarter.

753
01:01:59,827 --> 01:02:02,579
I'm Hoping is second by a half a length.

754
01:02:02,705 --> 01:02:06,785
Seymour's Darling is third and Little
Arnie moving past on the outside.

755
01:02:07,335 --> 01:02:11,962
Into the far turn, it is Red Lightning
in front by a length and a quarter.

756
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,589
Little Arnie is second by half a length.
I'm Hoping is third.

757
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,720
And a horse is down! It is Red Lightning.

758
01:02:19,598 --> 01:02:24,556
At the head of the stretch, it is I'm Hoping
taking the lead by half a length...

759
01:02:26,355 --> 01:02:28,015
(bang)

760
01:02:28,149 --> 01:02:30,604
Wait, stop! Stop, or I'll shoot!

761
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:42,492
(narrator) Nicky was dead at 4.24.

762
01:02:42,956 --> 01:02:46,325
At 2.15 that afternoon
Johnny Clay was still in the city.

763
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,998
He knew how long it would take
to drive to the track,

764
01:02:49,129 --> 01:02:51,288
park his car and walk to the grandstand.

765
01:02:51,423 --> 01:02:55,338
He planned to arrive just before
the start of the seventh race.

766
01:02:57,888 --> 01:02:59,928
(PA) Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

767
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:04,969
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,

768
01:03:05,104 --> 01:03:09,850
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.

769
01:04:18,682 --> 01:04:22,811
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

770
01:04:28,276 --> 01:04:31,977
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig?

771
01:04:32,113 --> 01:04:34,153
(phone rings)

772
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:40,071
Money room. Carter.

773
01:04:40,205 --> 01:04:42,032
Yes, sir, right away.

774
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,835
There's a riot downstairs. C'mon.

775
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:16,735
They're off and running.

776
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:20,737
At the start it is Red Lightning breaking
on top. Early Streak is second.

777
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:23,958
I'm Hoping is third. White Fire is fourth.

778
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:27,786
Little Arnie is next,
Seymour's Darling and Best Seller.

779
01:05:28,173 --> 01:05:31,624
Down the back stretch it's Red
Lighting by a length and a quarter.

780
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,631
I'm Hoping is second
by three quarters of a length.

781
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:39,093
Little Arnie is third by a length
and a quarter, and Seymour's Darling.

782
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:43,271
Passing the half-mile post it is Red
Lightning by a length and a quarter.

783
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,185
I'm Hoping is second by half a length.

784
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:50,647
Seymour's Darling is third, and
Little Arnie moving past on the outside.

785
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:55,489
Into the far turn it is Red Lightning
in front by a length and a quarter.

786
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:59,202
Little Arnie is second by
half a length. I'm Hoping is third.

787
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,498
And a horse is down. It is Red Lightning.

788
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:07,831
At the head of the stretch it is I'm Hoping
taking the lead by half a length.

789
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:11,548
Little Arnie, driving on the outside,
is second by three quarters.

790
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:14,678
Seymour's Darling is
third, and Early Streak.

791
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:18,969
It is Little Arnie and Seymour's
Darling. Little Arnie in front.

792
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:22,685
Down to the wire it is Little Arnie
going steadily, holding it...

793
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:25,601
and winning it by three
quarters of a length.

794
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:32,741
I'm Hoping second by three quarters of a
length, Seymour's Darling third by a head

795
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:35,405
and White Fire finished fourth.

796
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:43,036
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Be sure to hold all tickets.

797
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:47,001
The stewards are conducting
an inquiry into the seventh race

798
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,587
and will view the motion picture.

799
01:07:06,277 --> 01:07:11,272
Get your hands up, all of you! One move
from any of you and I'm gonna start firing.

800
01:07:11,616 --> 01:07:15,281
You. Fill that bag up just
as fast as you know how.

801
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:22,749
You. Take that gun out of the holster.
Be awful, awful careful how you do it.

802
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:32,921
Now drop it. Kick it over here.

803
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:38,387
All right, turn around and face the wall.

804
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,650
All right, now the money in the safe.

805
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:58,739
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
We have received no exact information

806
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:02,160
concerning the spill of Red
Lightning in the seventh race.

807
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:06,542
However, jockey Danny
Freed appears to be unhurt.

808
01:08:07,717 --> 01:08:10,006
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen...

809
01:08:10,136 --> 01:08:12,176
Fill it up!

810
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:15,971
...concerning the spill of Red
Lightning in the seventh race.

811
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:19,802
However, jockey Danny
Freed appears to be unhurt.

812
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:51,639
All right, all right, that's enough. Now put
the bag here in the middle of the floor.

813
01:08:52,723 --> 01:08:54,882
Get back over there.

814
01:08:55,017 --> 01:08:59,929
Now, I'm gonna open this door. I want you
to go through it and into the locker room.

815
01:09:00,064 --> 01:09:05,023
And close the door. I'll start firin' through
that door 15 seconds after you close it.

816
01:09:06,363 --> 01:09:08,402
Let's go.

817
01:09:16,457 --> 01:09:18,496
Now close it!

818
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,377
- Just a minute.
- What are you doing?

819
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:28,740
(radio) We interrupt this
broadcast for a news bulletin.

820
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:34,158
In one of the most daring hold-ups in
history, a bandit wearing a rubber mask

821
01:10:34,289 --> 01:10:38,501
today took an estimated $2,000,000
stuffed into a duffel bag from the offices

822
01:10:38,627 --> 01:10:42,293
of the Lansdowne racetrack. The robbery
occurred during the seventh race

823
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:45,590
and was timed to coincide with
the shooting of Red Lightning,

824
01:10:45,718 --> 01:10:50,179
just as the horse, valued at $250,000,
was leading the pack at the far turn.

825
01:10:50,306 --> 01:10:54,684
The jockey escaped with minor injuries.
A man identified as Nicky Arano,

826
01:10:54,811 --> 01:10:58,809
who allegedly shot the thoroughbred,
was fatally wounded by track police

827
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,645
as he attempted to shoot
his way out of the parking lot.

828
01:11:01,777 --> 01:11:05,027
At this time the mystery that
still plagues the authorities

829
01:11:05,155 --> 01:11:10,945
is how the bandit got away from the track
with the bulky bag containing the money.

830
01:11:11,078 --> 01:11:16,321
A search of the track is being conducted
in case the money is still hidden there.

831
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:20,327
And now we take you back to our
regularly-scheduled programme.

832
01:11:20,463 --> 01:11:23,714
No one saw the duffel bag
come out of the window.

833
01:11:27,137 --> 01:11:31,265
Ah, that part of it worked OK.
Landed right at my feet.

834
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:36,392
I reported my radio out of order
before I went out to the track.

835
01:11:36,522 --> 01:11:39,689
But the Captain's convinced
I was holed up somewhere, drunk.

836
01:11:39,817 --> 01:11:44,775
And if the Captain's convinced, there
ain't nobody that can unconvince him.

837
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:49,568
Besides, no one's gonna think anything
of seein' a cop at the racetrack.

838
01:11:49,703 --> 01:11:54,579
I mean, they won't get any funny ideas
about it, tie it in with the robbery.

839
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:58,662
Anyway, if they do it won't cut any ice.

840
01:11:58,796 --> 01:12:02,794
Captain knows I was drunk. And
he ain't a man you can argue with.

841
01:12:02,925 --> 01:12:07,801
So I guess I'll just have to... break down,
admit it, and take my punishment.

842
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:12,427
Yeah. That'd be terrible, wouldn't it,
Randy? A 30-day suspension.

843
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,512
It's 7.15.

844
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:20,854
Don't worry. He'll get here. He had to get
the dough at the motel where I dropped it.

845
01:12:20,986 --> 01:12:25,114
There was a funny little guy, name of Joe
Piano there. He runs the place, I guess.

846
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,285
- Sure hope Johnny can pick his friends.
- I need another drink.

847
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:37,420
Why ain't he here? Everything runs on
a timetable till it comes to payin' us.

848
01:12:37,545 --> 01:12:40,083
Then the timetable breaks down.

849
01:12:40,798 --> 01:12:43,634
He's supposed to be here at seven.

850
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,753
(buzzer)

851
01:12:47,222 --> 01:12:50,508
- I think I hear the elevator.
- That'll be Johnny.

852
01:12:56,607 --> 01:12:58,315
- Everybody up.
- What's this?

853
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:03,069
It'll be a massacre if you don't keep
those mitts up. Now, where's Johnny?

854
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,360
I been in that car since four
o'clock listenin' to that radio.

855
01:13:07,493 --> 01:13:12,321
I heard some pretty interesting things.
Grandpa, what time's Johnny get here?

856
01:13:12,457 --> 01:13:14,664
Somebody gave you a bum steer, buddy.

857
01:13:14,793 --> 01:13:18,127
Look around. Can't believe
you were tipped, huh?

858
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:22,502
Well, if I had a certain little lady here...
Where's the jerk? Where's George?

859
01:13:22,634 --> 01:13:24,295
The jerk's right here.

860
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:26,670
(gunfire continues)

861
01:13:55,336 --> 01:13:59,037
40 minutes before, at 6.25,
Johnny reached the motel.

862
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:04,215
Due to heavy traffic around the track,
he was 15 minutes behind schedule.

863
01:14:07,057 --> 01:14:09,096
Yeah? Who is it?

864
01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:13,103
Oh, it's, uh... it's just a mistake. I'm sorry.

865
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:42,673
Johnny arrived at the meeting
place at 7.29, still 15 minutes late.

866
01:14:51,103 --> 01:14:55,682
It had been prearranged that in the
event of an emergency before the split,

867
01:14:55,817 --> 01:14:58,853
the money was to be saved
by whoever had it at that time

868
01:14:58,987 --> 01:15:04,194
with no consideration of the fate of the
others, the money to be divided later.

869
01:15:04,326 --> 01:15:08,454
After what he had seen, not knowing the
cause or the circumstances of the others,

870
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:12,246
Johnny had no choice but to
save himself and the money.

871
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,929
Ten minutes later he bought
the largest suitcase he could find.

872
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:38,963
I'm back here, Val, darling.

873
01:16:41,262 --> 01:16:43,504
How'd it go, dear?

874
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:49,143
- (parrot) Watch it, there! Watch out!
- What happened?

875
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:53,564
Sherry... why? Why did you do it?

876
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:59,196
Do what, dearest? I was just getting
some clothes ready to go to the cleaners.

877
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:08,995
You had to be stupid. You couldn't even
play it smart with a gun pointed at you.

878
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:13,170
Well, you better get smart fast and
get outta here while you can still walk.

879
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:17,045
But your friend... Val, is that his name?

880
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:21,589
Yes, and you'd better get out
of here before he gets here.

881
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:23,761
I'm sick, Sherry. I...

882
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:27,098
Call an ambulance.

883
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:33,275
The door's behind you. Take a cab.

884
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:36,435
I love you, Sherry.

885
01:17:36,946 --> 01:17:39,651
George, you better go on
and go. You look terrible.

886
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:46,660
It isn't fair.

887
01:17:47,499 --> 01:17:50,120
I never had anybody but you.

888
01:17:51,253 --> 01:17:53,708
Not a real husband.

889
01:17:54,465 --> 01:17:56,920
Not even a man.

890
01:17:57,718 --> 01:18:01,668
Just a... bad joke without a punch line.

891
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:10,099
(parrot squawking)

892
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:29,875
(PA) American Airlines
announces the arrival

893
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:34,711
of flight 808 DC-7 service from Chicago.

894
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:38,343
American Airlines announces the arrival

895
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:43,013
of flight 808 DC-7 service from Chicago.

896
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:02,359
Sebastian and I are so ex cited. We haven't
seen Daddy sweetums for a long time.

897
01:19:02,495 --> 01:19:06,279
Will the nice man let us wait outside
so we can look at the airplanes?

898
01:19:06,416 --> 01:19:11,244
Certainly. You can stand outside. We'll be
announcing your husband's flight shortly.

899
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:17,584
He's a sweetums man. Let's hurry up real
fast and see Daddy come off the airplane.

900
01:19:19,304 --> 01:19:21,131
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

901
01:19:21,265 --> 01:19:25,393
Mr and Mrs Raymond Preston.
Nine o'clock flight for Boston.

902
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,608
We'll be announcing the on-time
departure of this flight very shortly, sir.

903
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:34,522
- Any other baggage?
- No, it was checked in this morning.

904
01:19:34,654 --> 01:19:37,858
Oh, say, I wanna carry that bag
with me on the plane, please.

905
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:42,071
I'm sorry, sir, it's too large. It'll have
to go checked through as baggage.

906
01:19:42,204 --> 01:19:45,988
Oh, now, let's be a little reasonable, huh?
You can't tell me

907
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:49,825
that the two of us are not entitled to
one piece of luggage between us.

908
01:19:49,962 --> 01:19:52,833
Sir, we have no objection
to one small bag. Even two.

909
01:19:52,965 --> 01:19:57,010
- We have nothing else. It was checked in.
- I see.

910
01:19:57,136 --> 01:20:00,505
It's close to flight time, but we can
locate the rest of your luggage.

911
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,053
- You could transfer the contents...
- No. I'm sorry, that won't work at all.

912
01:20:05,186 --> 01:20:07,475
Let me talk to your supervisor.

913
01:20:07,606 --> 01:20:11,105
All right. I'll be very happy
to call him. Mr Grimes?

914
01:20:11,235 --> 01:20:14,734
Mr Grimes? Could you
come down this way, please?

915
01:20:16,156 --> 01:20:19,857
- Good evening. What can we do for you?
- My wife and I are going to Boston.

916
01:20:19,994 --> 01:20:23,161
Our luggage has been checked through
and I want this in the cabin.

917
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:25,614
I'm afraid it ex ceeds the maximum size.

918
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:29,166
Yes, it does look a bit too large
for the passenger compartment.

919
01:20:29,295 --> 01:20:32,961
Sir, those are our regulations,
designed for your comfort and safety.

920
01:20:33,091 --> 01:20:35,629
- I can't make the trip without it.
- You really can't?

921
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:39,344
- Absolutely not.
- Well, in that case, I think we can, uh...

922
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:44,847
How about it? It's past cancellation time,
but I think we might stretch a point.

923
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:49,937
- We'll give you a full rebate, sir.
- Wait a minute. I don't want a rebate!

924
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:54,694
Sir, I don't know what to suggest. It's near
flight time. There are passengers waiting.

925
01:20:54,822 --> 01:20:58,405
Is the gentleman worried about the
contents? We'd be happy to insure it.

926
01:20:58,535 --> 01:21:02,200
More than happy. If you give me
its value and tell me what's in it.

927
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:07,206
No, there's nothing in it. I mean, uh,
just personal items, things like that.

928
01:21:07,336 --> 01:21:10,586
All right. All right. Check it through.

929
01:21:10,714 --> 01:21:14,547
Thank you, sir. I'm sure you'll find
the service to your satisfaction.

930
01:21:14,677 --> 01:21:20,098
(PA) ...the New Englander DC-7
service to Boston at gate eight.

931
01:21:47,295 --> 01:21:51,672
No, no, Sebastian. You mustn't
frighten pretty airplanes.

932
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,216
We go for trip on nice airplane some day.

933
01:22:13,781 --> 01:22:16,486
Sebastian, come back here!

934
01:22:58,954 --> 01:23:02,039
Mr Preston, we'll be
announcing boarding...

935
01:23:04,168 --> 01:23:06,706
Grimes speaking. What?

936
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:11,538
Oh, you're not serious?
Right out on the runway?

937
01:23:12,844 --> 01:23:15,086
Yes, sir, right away.

938
01:23:21,103 --> 01:23:26,346
(PA) Will passenger Preston please report
to the American Airlines ticket counter?

939
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:32,945
Will passenger Preston please report to
the American Airlines ticket counter?

940
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:35,359
Taxi!

941
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,045
Johnny, look.

942
01:23:57,391 --> 01:23:59,550
Johnny, you've got to run.

943
01:23:59,685 --> 01:24:03,137
Yeah... What's the difference?

944
01:24:14,618 --> 01:24:18,117
