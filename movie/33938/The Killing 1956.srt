1
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,997
And they're off!

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,710
It's Lucky Arrow breaking on top.
Purple Shadow is second.

3
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,713
At exactly 3:45 on that Saturday afternoon...

4
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,381
in the last week of September...

5
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:16,052
Marvin Unger was perhaps the only one
among the hundred thousand people
at the track...

6
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,888
who felt no thrill
at the running of the fifth race.

7
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,973
He was totally disinterested
in horse racing...

8
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,559
and held a lifelong contempt
for gambling.

9
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,772
Nevertheless, he had a five-dollar win bet
on every horse in the fifth race.

10
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,399
He knew, of course,
that this rather unique system of betting...

11
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,568
would more than likely
result in a loss.

12
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,153
But he didn't care...

13
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,448
for after all, he thought,
what would the loss of $20 or $30 mean...

14
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,035
in comparison to the vast sum of money
ultimately at stake?

15
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,080
- A bottle of ginger ale, please.
- Yes, sir. Coming right up.

16
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,837
Favorite broke bad.
Could be anybody's race.

17
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,881
- Lucky Arrow by a head.
Purple Shadow between horses.
- Could be.

18
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,718
- Put a five-dollar win
next to the five-dollar place.
- Stopwatch is third by three quarters.

19
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,013
Southern Star is next,
Main Entrance and Stanley Cage.

20
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,474
- Quite a crowd you got.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:07,687
Passing the quarter pole,
it is Lucky Arrow and Purple Shadow...

22
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,357
with Stopwatch on the outside to third.

23
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,111
At the head of the stretch,
it is Purple Shadow leading by a length.

24
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,822
Lucky Arrow is second by three quarters.

25
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,158
Stopwatch, going up on the outside,
is third by a length and a quarter.

26
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,036
Then comes Southern Star,
Main Entrance, Stanley Cage...

27
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,122
Third Row and Lover's Dilemma.

28
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,418
It is Lucky Arrow between horses by a head,
Purple Shadow by a head...

29
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,879
and Stopwatch moving fast
on the outside.

30
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,173
It's Lucky Arrow, Purple Shadow
and Stopwatch neck and neck.

31
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,051
It's Lucky Arrow, Purple Shadow
and Stopwatch.

32
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,471
It's Stopwatch taking the lead.

33
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,224
Stopwatch by a head.

34
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,020
Purple Shadow second by a head.
Lucky Arrow third by a length.

35
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,606
And Southern Star finished fourth.

36
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,005
Waiting for the race to become official...

37
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,967
he began to feel as if he had as much effect
on the final outcome of the operation...

38
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:25,014
as a single piece of a jumbo jigsaw puzzle
has to its predetermined final design.

39
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,475
Only the addition
of the missing fragments of the puzzle...

40
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,187
would reveal whether the picture
was as he guessed it would be.

41
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,734
The result of the fifth race
is now declared official.

42
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,130
Twenty-five dollars.

43
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,886
About an hour earlier
that same Saturday afternoon in September...

44
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,680
in another part of the city...

45
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,392
Patrolman First Class Randy Kennan
had some personal business to attend to.

46
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,895
- Hiya, Tiny. What's the good word?

47
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,439
Same as always. Havin' a ball.

48
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,483
I'll see you later.

49
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,281
Good evening, Randy.
How have things been?

50
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,994
What's the use of kickin', Leo?
You wouldn't believe it anyway.

51
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,414
Oh. I suppose they've been very well.

52
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,834
After all, a man drives a new car,
lives in a fine apartment.

53
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,920
So? I like to live good.
You got any objections?

54
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,214
None at all.

55
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,925
As long as you don't overlook
your obligation to me.

56
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,136
I trust it was purely an oversight.

57
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,389
I'm sure a man in your position
wouldn't deliberately...

58
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,433
antagonize his creditors.

59
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,019
I ain't got it, Leo.
I know I should have it.

60
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,856
And I'm as anxious to pay off
as you are to have me, but I just ain't got it.

61
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,318
Well, we all get a little cramped
now and then.

62
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,114
Suppose we make it a thousand?
I'll rewrite the balance as a new loan.

63
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,199
Give you a fiscal breather, fresh start.

64
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,453
Listen, Leo, I'm broke, get me?
Flat broke.

65
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,122
Right now I couldn't give you
a thousand cents.

66
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,125
- But if you can wait a couple of weeks -
- Might be arranged.

67
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,127
With the proper collateral, of course.

68
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,838
You mean, where is the dough comin' from?
I can't tell you, Leo.

69
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,340
All I can tell you is,
it's a plenty sweet deal...

70
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,384
and I'll be able to pay off
like a slot machine.

71
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,180
- In two weeks, you said? No longer?
- Maybe even less than that.

72
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,433
You know I wouldn't
pull a thing like this on you.

73
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,643
I couldn't afford to.

74
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,564
I'm glad you said that, Randy.
I was going to point out as much myself.

75
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,150
But since you relieve me
of the unpleasant necessity -

76
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,779
It's a deal then? I pay you the 2,600
within the next two weeks.

77
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,490
Plus $400 - a total of 3,000.

78
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,533
The extra interest, of course.

79
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,036
I trust that'll be satisfactory.

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,955
- I can't say no.
- Thank you, Randy.

81
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,666
I was sure you'd see it my way.

82
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,211
Take good care of yourself.

83
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,755
I'll take care of myself, mister.

84
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,924
That's my specialty.

85
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,259
At 7:00 p.m. That same day...

86
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,930
Johnny Clay, perhaps the most important
thread in the unfinished fabric...

87
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,182
furthered its design.

88
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,601
None of these men are criminals
in the usual sense.

89
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,522
They've all got jobs.
They all live seemingly normal, decent lives.

90
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,401
But they got their problems,
and they've all got a little larceny in 'em.

91
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,072
Now, you take my pal Unger, for instance,
the guy who owns this apartment.

92
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:32,201
He's putting up the money to operate with,
and he's letting me stay here.

93
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,286
He's a bookkeeper.

94
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,705
Been with the same company
for 10 years.

95
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,626
You know, Fay, the biggest mistake
I made before was shooting for peanuts.

96
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,671
Five years have taught me one thing,
if nothin' else -

97
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,590
Anytime you take a chance, you better
be sure the rewards are worth the risk...

98
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,386
because they can put you away
just as fast for a $10 heist
as they can for a million-dollar job.

99
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,888
You don't have to sell it to me, Johnny.

100
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,349
You know I'll go along
with anything you say.

101
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,644
I always have, you know,
ever since we were kids.

102
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,064
I've always believed you -
everything you've ever told me.

103
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:08,237
Those five years you've been away, I -
I know they must have been terrible for you.

104
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:13,242
I mean, being locked up
must be a terrible thing.

105
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,912
You know something?

106
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,665
This may sound funny, but...

107
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,127
waiting for you all those years
and staying by myself -

108
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,463
it was like, not that you were locked in...

109
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,549
but I was locked out.

110
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,635
Well, look at me.

111
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,388
First time we've been together in five years,
and I'm making speeches.

112
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,267
Now, now. Everything is gonna be all right.
I promise you.

113
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,354
Make sure you're right about it, Johnny.
I'm no good for anybody else.

114
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:47,276
I'm not pretty, and I'm not very smart.
So please don't leave me alone anymore.

115
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,028
Aw, nothing is gonna happen.

116
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,030
Not this time.

117
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,825
Well, I - I guess I'd better
leave you be now.

118
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,244
I know you've got a lot of work to do.

119
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,289
When will I see you again?

120
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,625
Saturday night.
We'll be on the plane together.

121
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,463
Look, Fay, until it's all over,
I want you to stay out of the way. Yeah?

122
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,298
If there's anything I can do to help -

123
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,759
No. Nothing.
You just make the plane reservations.

124
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,886
And remember,
tell 'em at the office that you're leaving.

125
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,013
Tell 'em you're getting married, huh?

126
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,515
I don't wanna say good-bye.

127
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,978
- Oh.
- Hello, Marv. We were just talking about you.

128
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,564
- Hi, Johnny. Hi, Miss Fay.
- Hello.

129
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,192
- I hope it was something nice.
- Oh, yes.

130
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,986
Johnny was telling me about
what a wonderful friend you were.

131
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,240
- Fay was just leaving, weren't you, baby?
- Oh, don't rush off on my account. I -

132
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,825
- Ah, she's late for an appointment.
- That's right.

133
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,080
- You'll be sure to call me, won't you, Johnny?
- Yeah. I'll do just what I told you I would.

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,253
- It was nice to see you again, Mr. Unger.
- Thank you.

135
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,839
- Take care of Johnny.
- Oh, there's nothing I wouldn't do for Johnny.

136
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,591
I'll see you.

137
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
A half an hour earlier,
at approximately 6:30...

138
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,890
Mike O'Reilly,
the track bartender, came home.

139
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,142
Ruthie? I'm home.

140
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,055
At 7:15 that same night...

141
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,434
George Peatty, the track cashier,
arrived at his apartment.

142
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,477
- Hello.

143
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,735
Hello.

144
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,655
- Feelin' okay?
- Fine.

145
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,742
I been kinda sick today.
I keep gettin' pains in my stomach.

146
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,536
Maybe you got a hole in it, George.
Do you suppose you have?

147
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,164
A hole in it?
How would I get a hole in my stomach?

148
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,249
How would you get one in your head?

149
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,128
Go fix me a drink, George.
I think I'm developing some pains myself.

150
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,132
Sherry, can't I ever say anything at all
without you joking to me about it?

151
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,844
Hurry up with that drink, George.
The pains are gettin' worse.

152
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,098
I saw somethin' kinda nice
comin' home on the train tonight.

153
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,768
Somethin', well, kinda sweet.

154
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,103
A candy bar, George?

155
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,522
No, not a candy bar, doughnut.

156
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,361
It was people.

157
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,239
This couple sittin' just in front of me.

158
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,785
Oh, they weren't young, exactly.
I guess the woman was about your age.

159
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:47,122
A little senile, you mean?
With one foot and a big toe in the grave?

160
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,416
You wanna hear this or not?
Do you or not, Sherry?

161
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,628
I can't wait.
Go ahead and thrill me, George.

162
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,130
Well, anyway, like I say,
they were sittin' just in front of me...

163
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,008
and I could hear what they were sayin' -
well, part of it.

164
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,219
They weren't young, exactly,
and they weren't really old.

165
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,554
She was about my age, you said.
Not anymore.

166
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,641
Maybe she was when you started
telling this story, but not now.

167
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,560
Anyway, she was calling him Papa,
and he was calling her Mama.

168
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:13,482
And the climax to this exciting story?
The moral? The punch line, George?

169
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,234
Forget it, Sherry.

170
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,945
Just thought I'd tell you about it,
but I might have known.

171
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,989
Oh, I know. You want to bet I know?
I'll give you seven-to-five.

172
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,200
Cut it out, will you, Sherry?

173
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm tired. I don't feel so good.

174
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:30,040
You want me to call you Papa, isn't that it,
George? And you wanna call me Mama.

175
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,042
- You know all the answers.
- Go right ahead.

176
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,129
Course, it may be the last word you ever say,
but I'll try to kill you as painlessly as possible.

177
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,132
- I gotta go out tonight.
I don't suppose there's anything for dinner.

178
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,135
Of course there is, darling.
There are all sorts of things.

179
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,805
- We have steak and asparagus and potatoes.
- I don't smell nothin'.

180
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,307
Well, that figures.
'Cause you're too far away from it.

181
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,060
- Too far away from it?
- Certainly. You don't think
I had it all cooked, do you?

182
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,146
It's all down in the shopping center.

183
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,482
Tell me something, would you, Sherry?

184
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,026
Just tell me one thing.

185
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,571
Why did you ever marry me anyway?

186
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:05,033
George, when a man has to ask his wife that,
well, he just hadn't better, that's all.

187
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,704
Why talk about it?
Maybe it's all to the good in the long run.

188
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,541
After all, if people didn't have headaches,
what would happen to the aspirin industry?

189
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,918
You used to love me.
You said you did, anyway.

190
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,546
I seem to recall you made
a memorable statement too.

191
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,175
Something about hitting it rich
and having an apartment on Park Avenue...

192
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,886
and a different car
for every day of the week.

193
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,430
Not that I really care about such things,
understand...

194
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,224
as long as I have a big, handsome,
intelligent brute like you.

195
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,853
It would make a difference, wouldn't it?
If I had money, I mean.

196
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,897
How would you define money, George?

197
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,232
If you're thinkin' of giving me
your collection of Roosevelt dimes -

198
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,652
I mean big money.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

199
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,739
You really don't feel well, do you?
You sure that pain's in your stomach?

200
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,784
I'm gonna have it, Sherry. Hundreds
of thousands, maybe a half a million.

201
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,912
Of course you are, darling.

202
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,415
Did you put the right address on the envelope
when you sent it to the North Pole?

203
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,126
Go ahead and laugh.
Wait and see.

204
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,922
Maybe you won't be laughing so hard
in a few days.

205
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,175
You're really serious. You really think
you're gonna have a lot of money.

206
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,385
I don't think nothin'. I know it.

207
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,765
You've never been a liar, George.
You don't have enough imagination to lie.

208
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,268
So what makes you think,
or know, that you're gonna have
several hundred thousand dollars?

209
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,604
'Cause I do.
I just can't talk about it, that's all.

210
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,189
Not even to me, your little Sherry?

211
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,441
I shouldn't have even mentioned
I was going to have it.

212
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,735
It's not that I mind.
I know I can trust you.

213
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,279
- But if these other guys ever -
- "These other guys"?

214
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,615
I can't talk about it, Sherry.
I just can't.

215
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,619
"These other guys" - Is that why you're
going out tonight, to meet with them?

216
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,206
They got nothin' to do with that.
I just gotta go uptown for a little while.

217
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,125
I see. Well, you go right ahead, George.

218
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,795
If you wanna act that way,
I certainly won't try to stop you.

219
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,756
Sherry, no.
Sherry, honey, don't be sore at me.

220
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,969
Well, after all, when a woman's
been married for five years,
and her own husband doesn't trust her -

221
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,346
Why, you think more of them
than you do of me.

222
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,807
What right have you got
to say a thing like that?

223
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,477
You know I'm crazy about you.
I'd do anything in the world for you.

224
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,313
Honey, you're the one I'm doing it for.
If I didn't love you so much -

225
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,358
Look, I don't want you to do anything for me.
I don't even wanna talk to you anymore.

226
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,485
You go up and see your fella,
whatever you wanna do.

227
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,903
Sherry!

228
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,155
But don't you be surprised
if I'm not here when you get home.

229
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,907
Don't you at all be surprised.

230
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:12,119
You better be here, you hear me, Sherry?
You will be, won't you?

231
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,997
You wouldn't do anything foolish,
would you?

232
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:20,043
I certainly wouldn't want to,
but as long as you don't trust me
or have the slightest bit of faith in me -

233
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,504
Sherry, if I ever found you
with another man -

234
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,298
But why? You have no use for me.

235
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,175
Oh, you say you do, but when it comes
to a showdown or proving it...

236
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,761
well, you say one thing,
then you do the opposite.

237
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,559
Well, I could tell you
a little bit about it, I guess.

238
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,352
Well, most of it.

239
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,689
- But you got to promise to keep quiet.
- Why, of course, darling.

240
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,318
Just a second.

241
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,280
- Well!
- Hello.

242
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,198
Hello.

243
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,285
- How'd you get away from George tonight?
- He had to go somewhere.

244
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,787
That's a break.
I'm glad you called me.

245
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,208
Something wrong, baby?

246
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,669
No, nothing's wrong.

247
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,505
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't think so.

248
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,885
Come on, now. That's not my baby.

249
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,512
- Val, I called you last night.
- Oh, yeah?

250
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,057
- There was no answer.
- Mmm. I guess I stepped out.

251
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,767
I called you four times.

252
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,852
Honey, I guess I was out somewhere.

253
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
Oh? What'd you do?

254
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,107
I don't know. I guess I was goofin' off
at a movie or something.

255
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,234
Val, why are you doing this to me?

256
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,780
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

257
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,157
Oh, look, Mrs. Peatty.

258
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,326
What I do is my own business.

259
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,161
I never tried to pin you down, did I?

260
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,081
I never asked you how you got your kicks
before you met me, did I?

261
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,583
That hurt, Val.
You didn't used to talk to me like that.

262
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,002
I'm sorry, baby, but don't bug me.

263
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,796
I gotta live my life a certain way.

264
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,298
I can't stand it when the walls
start closin' in.

265
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,384
But you know how crazy I am about ya.

266
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,594
And I'm crazy about you too, sweetheart.

267
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,639
I've given you sufficient proof of that.

268
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,266
Well, I know.
It's just that lately every time I call -

269
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,102
So I step out once in a while.

270
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,438
Look, you got yourself a husband,
a guy who'll spend every last nickel on you...

271
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,818
won't ask you any questions
when you come home from
an afternoon movie at 9:00 at night.

272
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,862
- Don't be greedy.
- I'm not greedy, Val. I'm in love with you.

273
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,949
If that's being greedy, then I'm the biggest
glutton that ever walked the Earth.

274
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,160
Don't make it sound so ominous.
It's not like you're gonna eat me alive.

275
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,204
I may just do that.

276
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,253
Darling, what are the two things in life
you're most interested in?

277
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,296
- What?
- Money and women?

278
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,382
Oh. That's a nice way to put me down.

279
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,635
- That about sums it up, doesn't it?
- We'll let it stand.

280
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,139
But I imagine what you really meant to say
was "money and woman."

281
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,808
We're gonna have money, Val,
more money than you ever dreamed of.

282
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,519
- Maybe even millions.
- Oh, yeah? How?

283
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,106
George. That's how.
He's stumbled onto somethin' big.

284
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,151
- That meatball?
- A meatball with gravy, Val.

285
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,944
You know he works at the track.

286
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,281
Well, somehow - and don't ask me how -
but he's got connected with a mob.

287
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,701
They're gonna rob the track offices
for the day's receipts.

288
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,163
You mean he seriously told you
that he and some mob are gonna
knock over the racetrack?

289
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:05,083
And you can believe him, Val, 'cause George
may be a fool, but he's not a liar.

290
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,419
The guy's crazy.
That's never been done before.

291
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,423
I know. I told him that, but he says the job's
all set up, and it's gonna be done.

292
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,093
And if I just sit tight, I'd be up
to my curls in cash, just like that.

293
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:21,475
Well, let's suppose this is all true.
How do I fit in?

294
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,020
Well, you know I've been gonna leave George.
I guess you know why too.

295
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,106
Well, you've been saying that
for a long, long time, Sherry.

296
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,486
But everything's changed now.
I was gonna tell him tonight.

297
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,322
- George may be very rich very soon.

298
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,073
That's all he needs, isn't it?

299
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,201
He'd still be George.

300
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:45,207
So you think, uh, let's say George and his boys
pull this job, and George gets his cut.

301
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,667
Maybe I could take it away from him, huh?

302
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,753
I think you could.

303
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,381
What about the others?
You got any idea who they are?

304
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,968
Only this. I went through his clothes
while he was showering.

305
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,846
I'm quite sure George went there tonight.

306
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,890
Hmm.

307
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,893
Kiddo, I think we got somethin' here.

308
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,021
You know, if this is true,
this is a lot bigger than you think.

309
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,774
You're interested in taking Georgie's cut?
Well, I got news for you.

310
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,860
Georgie's cut's gonna be peanuts
compared to this whole thing.

311
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,655
We gotta find out more
about the overall plan.

312
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,949
- You think he'd tell you any more?
- Not a chance.

313
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,244
I could see he was scared stiff
'cause he talked as much as he did.

314
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,539
I don't get it, Johnny -
about these two other guys.

315
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:32,003
You mean there's gonna be
two other guys in on the deal,
and we ain't gonna know who they are?

316
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,215
That's right. You don't know who they are,
and they don't know who you are.

317
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,385
- That makes sense to you, doesn't it?
- Yes, I guess so, but -

318
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:42,472
It makes sense to me, all right.
How come we need 'em, though, Johnny?
What are they gonna do?

319
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,558
Well, one of them's
for the job with the rifle.

320
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,102
None of you boys can handle that,
even if you were willing to.

321
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,812
And the other one
starts the fight in the bar.

322
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,523
These other fellas - how much
are they cuttin' in for? Not that I mind.

323
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,275
Anything you do is okay, but -

324
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,193
These men are not gonna be
in on the basic scheme.

325
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,655
They're getting paid to perform certain
definite duties at a certain definite time.

326
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,782
And they're not cutting in on the take.

327
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,118
They'll be paid a flat price
to do a straight job.

328
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,997
Well, if they don't know anything
about the basic plan, about the job,
then why are they doin' it?

329
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,457
It's simple. These boys are straight hoods.
They get paid in advance.

330
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,835
Five grand for the one with the rifle,
and 2,500 for the other.

331
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,380
- Where's this money comin' from?
- That's where Marvin comes in.

332
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,967
He's getting the 7,500 for us,
and he gets it back off the top.

333
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,303
I wish I could do more, Johnny.

334
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,763
It's almost not right for me
to get as much as everybody else.

335
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,975
- After all, all I do is -
- Your money counts for plenty, Marv.

336
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,060
You don't hear any of them
complaining, do you?

337
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,022
Sure. You're okay in our book, Marv.
But look, Johnny.

338
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,775
If these two hoods get paid in advance, how
do you know they're gonna do their jobs?

339
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,528
I'll vouch for 'em. These guys are pros.

340
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:42,115
They can't afford to weasel out on a deal.
If they did, they'd be washed up. Okay?

341
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,200
- Okay.
- Any other questions?

342
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,330
Well, let's take a look at this then.

343
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,834
This is a rough drawing of the track
as I remember it.

344
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,421
Randy, you'll have to get me
an A-1 street map of the whole district.

345
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,634
George, Mike, I want you
to go over this thing with me inch by inch.

346
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,012
Bring it completely up to date,
add or subtract the slightest change...

347
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,724
even if it's something as small
as the placement of a hot dog stand.

348
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,477
Now, give or take a few thousand...

349
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,688
I figure the loot on this deal
at two million.

350
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,359
There should be that much
in the track offices.

351
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,778
That includes profits
on the parimutuel betting...

352
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,739
the breakage money,
taxes from the mutuel machines...

353
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,534
receipts from the concessions
and the money from ticket sales.

354
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,163
None of this money is allowed to accumulate
at any one point around the track.

355
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,874
Except for money to make change with
and the mutuel clerk's payoff money...

356
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,210
why, it all goes into the office.

357
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,004
And out of the entire take,
only a few thousand dollars...

358
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,548
is put in the office safe
to cover emergencies.

359
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,885
The rest is out in the open,
held for pickup by armored car.

360
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,137
That car arrives about 5:00...

361
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,057
and parks directly in front
of the main entrance to the clubhouse.

362
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,769
Two men stay in it - one at the wheel,
and the other at a machine gun in the turret.

363
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,854
Two others enter the office
to collect the dough.

364
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:59,067
Now, they're armed, of course, and so are
the track detectives who cover them
from the car to the office and back.

365
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,778
Now, once the armored car arrives,
a, uh, stickup is -

366
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,115
- Is out of the question.

367
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,978
Say, now, what in the name of Pete
would a babe be doing outside that door?

368
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,772
Uh, what do you think?

369
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,941
You guys, any of you ever
see this woman before?

370
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,485
- It's Sherry, my wife.
- Why, you -

371
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,571
You been talkin'.
Now you spilled to her.

372
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,198
I did not. What, do you think I'm crazy?
I wouldn't -

373
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,950
You jerk! You clown!

374
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,952
Come on, clown.
Sing us a chorus from Pagliacci.

375
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,289
You better talk, George. Come clean.
Either you talk, or we'll get it out of her.

376
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,541
Please, you wouldn't do anything
to her, Johnny? Please.

377
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,461
I don't wanna, but if you won't talk,
if you won't tell us what you told her -

378
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,256
I didn't tell her nothin'! Honest, I didn't.
Why would I do a thing like that, Johnny?

379
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,468
Sure, she wouldn't.
She's just a building inspector, isn't she?

380
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,345
Just stopped outside that door
to measure the keyhole. Why, you -

381
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,931
Let's have it, George.
We're gonna get it out of one of ya.

382
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,684
If you didn't tell her,
then why was she around here snoopin'?

383
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,229
Oh! She must have found the address
in my pocket.

384
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,523
Sure. That's what it was.
Thought I was two-timing her.

385
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,234
You know, runnin' around with another -

386
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,738
Of course.
She's just checkin' up on me, John.

387
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,203
I didn't tell her nothin'.
Honest, I didn't.

388
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,290
You'll let her go, won't you?
You won't hurt her, John?

389
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,211
Randy? Mike?
Take him home to his apartment
and stick with him until I phone you.

390
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,464
- No, I'm not leaving Sherry!
- You're leavin', all right.

391
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,008
Now, how are you goin' -
slidin' or walkin'?

392
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,094
Come on, George, let's go.

393
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,349
What are you gonna do now, Johnny?

394
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,853
Ah, I don't think I'll have to kill her.

395
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,106
Just slap that pretty face
into hamburger meat, that's all.

396
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,400
Marv, why don't you take yourself
a walk for an hour or so?

397
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,946
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll be -
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

398
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:53,700
All right, sister, that's a mighty pretty head
you've got on your shoulders.

399
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,619
You wanna keep it there, or do you wanna
start carrying it around in your hands?

400
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,414
Maybe we could compromise
and put it on your shoulder.

401
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,792
- I think that'd be nice, don't you?
- What were you doing outside that door?

402
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,421
Doing? I was listening, naturally.
Trying to, I should say.

403
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,506
Oh, you admit it?
You admit you were out there snooping?

404
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:12,135
Yes. Wasn't that naughty of me?
But I'm afraid I was.

405
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,262
I found an address in George's pocket.

406
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,140
I thought he might be playing around
with another woman, so I came over here.

407
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,560
And you'd care if he was playin'
another dame? That would bother you?

408
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,608
You don't understand me, Johnny.
You don't know me very well.

409
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,153
I know you like a book.
You're a no good, nosy little tramp.

410
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,364
You'd sell out your own mother for a piece
of fudge, but you're smart along with it.

411
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,202
Smart enough to know when to sell
and when to sit tight, and you know
you better sit tight in this case.

412
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,913
- I do?
- You heard me. You like money.

413
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:43,291
You got a great big dollar sign there
where most women have a heart.

414
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,211
So play it smart. Stay in character,
and you'll have money, plenty of it.

415
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,923
George'll have it, and he'll blow it on you.
Probably buy himself a five-cent cigar.

416
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,759
Mmm. You don't know me
very well, Johnny.

417
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:56,971
I wouldn't think of letting George
throw his money away on cigars.

418
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,474
Isn't there a big "if" in there somewhere?

419
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,434
Yeah. There's a couple of 'em.

420
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,355
If you're smart, if you keep your trap shut
and don't nose around anymore,
you'll have money.

421
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,106
You'll be loaded with a capital "L."

422
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,192
But if you don't, there'll be nothing.
We'll forget the whole thing.

423
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,985
Nothing will happen,
and you won't have a penny.

424
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,906
I wouldn't like that, and, frail as I am,
I'd much prefer to be loaded.

425
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,866
I think we understand each other.

426
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,409
Now beat it.

427
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,872
Those guys.
Fine friends they turned out to be.

428
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,583
Slappin' me around,
callin' me dirty names.

429
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,544
I thought that rotten Randy
would cave the side of my head in.

430
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,256
Poor George.
You're all right now, aren't you, darling?

431
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,800
Doggone it, Sherry, you shouldn't
have come over there tonight.

432
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,927
It's a wonder we both didn't get killed.

433
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:40,682
I don't think there was much danger of that.
After all, if they'd killed you,
there couldn't be a robbery.

434
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,643
If they'd done anything to harm me
or seriously offend you, why -

435
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,853
They have offended me.
They've offended me plenty.

436
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,356
Oh, George, don't be such an old bear.

437
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,608
They have,
and I'm not gonna forget it in a hurry.

438
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:55,196
Well, what else could they have done?
I thought they acted quite reasonably.

439
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,282
Well, anyway -

440
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,743
What - What did Johnny do to you?

441
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,829
Do? I already told you.

442
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,874
Just asked me some questions
and made sure it was all right for me to leave.

443
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,044
Sherry, did - did Johnny try anything?

444
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,213
Why, George,
what a terrible thing for you to ask.

445
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,091
- I was pretty sure that you wouldn't -
- I don't think you'd better say any more.

446
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,678
Why did you come over there tonight,
Sherry? It wasn't for the reason you said.

447
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,472
It was for the reason you said, George.
You said it yourself.

448
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,310
I was just trying to make an alibi for you.
I was afraid those guys'd kill you.

449
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,478
You know that I wouldn't look
at another woman.

450
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,939
There wouldn't be any women
chasing after a guy like me.

451
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,733
Oh, let's drop it, George.

452
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,569
You put words in my mouth,
and then you say they're not true.

453
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,613
I told you exactly what happened.

454
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,699
Oh, dear.

455
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,951
Everything's all right
with you and your pals now.

456
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,037
You're gonna have
lots and lots of money and -

457
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,040
- I've been thinkin' it over, Sherry.
- I can hardly wait.

458
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,167
How soon will it be, George?
What day?

459
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,003
It ain't going to be, Sherry.
I'm droppin' out.

460
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,757
You're dropping -
Oh, you don't mean it. You can't mean it.

461
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,592
I'm afraid, Sherry.

462
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,094
This business tonight,
it kinda opened my eyes.

463
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,390
It made me realize the kind of guys
I was getting mixed up with.

464
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,267
Before, all I thought of was the money.

465
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,811
Well, you just keep on
thinking about that, George.

466
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:12,231
Think how disappointed I'd be
if you didn't get that money.

467
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,692
I'm afraid I'd feel like
you didn't really love me.

468
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,779
I don't see how I could feel any other way.

469
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,283
Why? Why should I have to do a thing
like that to prove to you that I love you?

470
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,536
George, what are you gonna do?
I wanna know right now.

471
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,705
All you've ever done
is talk about loving me.

472
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,958
That's all I've had
for the last five years is talk.

473
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,295
Now that you have a chance
to do something and to -

474
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,215
all those things you promised -
buy me things -

475
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,966
Well, what are you gonna do, George?

476
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,220
You know there ain't a thing in the world
I wouldn't do for you.

477
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,722
Then you'll do this for me, won't you?

478
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,812
I guess so.

479
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,482
It'll be perfect, George.
You have no idea how perfect.

480
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,778
I won't have long to wait, will I?
It will be within the next few days, won't it?

481
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,073
- Oh, when will it be, George?
- You got your own way, Sherry.

482
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,409
You wanted me to go ahead with the deal,
so I'm going.

483
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,577
Now leave me alone, will you?

484
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,621
I'm sorry, darling. Of course.

485
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,499
We won't even talk about it
if you don't want to.

486
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,793
You really love me, Sherry?

487
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,420
Of course.

488
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,422
You'll always love me?

489
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,424
Always and always.

490
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,518
Three days later,
at 10:15 on a Tuesday morning...

491
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,438
Johnny Clay began the final preparations.

492
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,945
- You want somebody to play with?
- Uh, no, thanks. I'm just lookin' for a friend.

493
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,991
Oh, you patsan. You missed a move.

494
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:49,120
Knight to knight five, pawn takes knight,
rook takes rook, queen to rook four, check.

495
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,247
- King to bishop -
- Go away. Bother someone else!

496
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,332
You don't know what you're talkin'!
He couldn't do that!

497
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,794
- You don't know what you're talkin'!
- Shut up, patsan. Make a move.

498
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,838
He's right.
I could have won your rook.

499
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,175
- Move, patsan!
- Look, stop talkin' or I'll call Fisher.

500
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,218
I can't think with all this noise!

501
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,387
Good game, Maurice?

502
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,806
Johnny Clay, my old friend.
How are you?

503
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,850
Good to see you, Maurice.
Been a long time, huh?

504
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,561
- How long have you been out?
- Oh, not very long.

505
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,688
It was very difficult, no?

506
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,273
Yeah.

507
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,358
Very difficult.

508
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,360
You have my sympathies, Johnny.

509
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,864
You have not yet learned that in this life
you have to be like everyone else -

510
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,407
the perfect mediocrity.

511
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,242
No better, no worse.

512
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,413
Individuality is a monster,
and it must be strangled in its cradle...

513
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,999
to make our friends feel comfortable.

514
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,628
You know, I often thought
that the gangster and the artist...

515
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,255
are the same in the eyes of the masses.

516
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,551
They're admired and hero-worshipped,
but there is always present...

517
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:49,430
underlying wish to see them destroyed
at the peak of their glory.

518
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,682
Yeah. Like the, um -

519
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:56,103
Like the man said,
"Life is like a glass of tea." Huh?

520
00:30:56,188 --> 00:31:00,066
Oh, Johnny, my friend,
you never were very bright...

521
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,318
but I love you anyway.

522
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,112
How, uh - How's life
been treating you, Maurice?

523
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,282
About the same as always.

524
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,952
When I need some money,
I go out and wrestle.

525
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,121
But mostly I'm up here,
wasting my time playing chess.

526
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,333
But, you know, I wouldn't know
what to do with myself...

527
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,961
if I didn't have this place to come to.

528
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,964
Maurice, could you use $2,500?

529
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,759
It has a pleasant ring to the ear.
Quite musical.

530
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,469
What is it for?

531
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,889
For taking care of half a dozen private dicks.
Racetrack cops.

532
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,141
I want you to start a fight
with the bartender at the track.

533
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,270
The track cops will try to break it up.
You keep 'em busy for as long as you can.

534
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,398
Make 'em drag you out of the place.
No gunplay. Strictly a muscle job.

535
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,525
Would it be out of order for me to ask...

536
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,821
for what it is that you are willing to pay such
a price to see me demonstrate my talents?

537
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:51,409
I would imagine it is for more
than just your own personal entertainment.

538
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:55,371
$2,500 is a lot of dough, Maurice.
Part of it's for not asking questions.

539
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,665
That sounds not unreasonable.

540
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,295
Still, I will probably go to jail,
and jails I have found unpleasant.

541
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:06,882
Food is very bad, company is poor,
beds are too small.

542
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,469
Ah, it'll only be a disorderly conduct charge.
Maybe 60 days, nothing worse.

543
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:14,223
And if a man has a little money
to spread around in the right places,
he can be quite comfortable for his stay.

544
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,350
I do not quite understand, Johnny.

545
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:20,605
For what you want me to do, you could
get any hoodlum for a hundred dollars.

546
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,065
Yeah. I don't want any hoodlum.
I want a guy like you.

547
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,026
Someone who's absolutely dependable...

548
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,112
who knows he's being well-paid to take a risk
and won't squawk if the going gets rough.

549
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,241
I was thinking, if perhaps you can't
work out some other arrangement -

550
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,286
2,500 I like very much.

551
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,830
But suppose I were willing
to forgo part of it...

552
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,709
and take a share
in your, uh, enterprise instead.

553
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,545
- No?
- No. It's not mine to share up.

554
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,466
Very well, Johnny. Now I sense
there will be certain details to work out.

555
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,385
Yeah. I'll buy you a cup of coffee, huh?

556
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,936
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's exactly what I wanted.

557
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,398
Yeah, pops, you could take care of a whole
roomful of people with that gun.

558
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,401
Maybe not kill 'em all, but then they
wouldn't be good for anything afterwards.

559
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,864
I knew you'd take care of it for me, Nikki.
Say, uh, how long have you had this place?

560
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,407
Almost a year.

561
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,160
Yeah, and it's picturesque enough,
but there can't be much profit in it.

562
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,955
There isn't.
But then there isn't much trouble neither.

563
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,710
- What are you thinking about?
- A job. Your kind of a job. A job with a rifle.

564
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,837
- What kind of money, pops?
- 5,000.

565
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,424
- Who do I have to kill?
- A horse.

566
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,426
- A horse?
- A four-legged horse.

567
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,428
- And for that I get 5,000?
- Well, for that and -

568
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,640
I figured there'd be a gimmick.

569
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,267
The gimmick isn't as tough
as you may think.

570
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,646
You shoot the horse, and, if by any chance
anything goes wrong, you don't squawk.

571
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,815
And all I gotta do is bump off a horse?

572
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,109
- Well, it's a special kind of a horse, Nick.
- So?

573
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,236
For certain reasons,
including your own protection...

574
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,781
in case anything happens, I'm not gonna
give you the whole story, just your part of it.

575
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,450
Next Saturday the $100,000 handicap
is being run.

576
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,870
In the seventh race - that's the big race of
the season - there's a certain horse running.

577
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,581
He's one of the best three-year-olds
to come along in the last 10 years.

578
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,585
He's a big money winner, and he won't
pay even money because half the people
out there are gonna be down on him.

579
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,464
All right. There's a parking lot less than 300
feet from the northwest corner of the track.

580
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,675
From a car parked
in the southeast corner of that lot...

581
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:17,138
you get a perfect view of the horses
as they come around the far corner
and start into the stretch.

582
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:21,183
A man sitting in a car parked in that spot
using a high-powered rifle
with a telescopic sight...

583
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,894
should be able to bring down
any given horse with a single shot.

584
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,814
And a man with your eye
would hardly need a telescopic sight.

585
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,816
That horse is worth
a quarter of a million bucks...

586
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,651
and you know the crowd
would go completely nuts.

587
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:33,237
So what? Let 'em go nuts.
You can do it. You can do it easy.

588
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,031
And you shouldn't have too much trouble
getting away in the confusion.

589
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,951
Red Lightning will undoubtedly be leading
in the stretch because that's the way he runs.

590
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,537
So he goes down, a couple of other horses
pile up on top of him.

591
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,165
- There'll be plenty of confusion.
I can guarantee you that.
- Yeah.

592
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:48,502
And there's one more thing -
Suppose by accident you do get picked up.
What've you done? You shot a horse.

593
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,839
It isn't first-degree murder.
In fact, it isn't even murder.
In fact, I don't know what it is.

594
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,176
But the chances are, the best they could
get you on would be, uh, inciting a riot...

595
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,511
or shooting horses out of season
or something like that.

596
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,389
Well, you put it down, 'cause you make it
sound real simple. You know, pops?

597
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,058
- 5,000 bucks for rubbin' out a horse.

598
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,853
- Okay, pops. How do I get it?

599
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,857
- 2,500 today, 2,500 the day after the race.
- Okay. Crazy. Now, tell me something -

600
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,569
What's your angle, John?
They'll probably call the race off, huh?

601
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,863
And they won't pay off any of the bets?
Come on.

602
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,741
Maybe. But what my angle is
is my business.

603
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,869
And, Nikki, 5,000 bucks is a lot of dough,
and that's what I'm paying it for -

604
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,871
so nobody has to know my business.

605
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,291
All right, John.
I got no troubles with you. I'm with you.

606
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,433
- I'm lookin' for Joe Piano.
- Who's lookin' for Joe?

607
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,185
- Patsy sent me.
- Patsy who?

608
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,395
- Patsy Gennelli.
- Where did you see Patsy?

609
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,439
Alcatraz. We roomed together.
My name -

610
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,192
Don't tell me who you are.
What can I do for you?

611
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,278
I want a place to stay for about a week.
I won't be in it very much.

612
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,240
I don't want it cleaned, and I don't want
anybody else in it except myself.

613
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,326
I think I can accommodate you.
So how's the boy?

614
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,538
Eh, he's fine. He's doing it on his ear.
He's the best pitcher they got up there.

615
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,998
- Yeah, I know.
- He told me to tell you
not to worry about him.

616
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,501
Yeah, he's doing the book, you know.
I worry plenty.

617
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,503
Well, he's a tough kid.
Maybe he'll get a break.

618
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,505
Yeah, I know. Let's hope.

619
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,635
Here you are. I got another one.
You don't have to worry about
leaving anything in here.

620
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,097
It'll be safe. I'm always over here.
There'll be no maid service.

621
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,225
- You wanna leave anything in there?
- Just this, and another bag next week.

622
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,185
Don't you worry.
Nobody will disturb them.

623
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,564
- All right. What'll it be?
- Oh, no. No charge. You said Patsy sent you.

624
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,900
Sure, he sent me, but he's a friend of mine.
I'd feel better if I paid.

625
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,027
Kind of a business arrangement.
I can afford it.

626
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,281
- Okay, then. It'll be $10 a week.
- All right.

627
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,783
I'll send the money in the bus to the boy.

628
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,536
Thank you very much.
Have a nice time, huh?

629
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,617
Four days later, at 7:30 a. M...

630
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,161
Sherry Peatty was wide awake.

631
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,509
Gosh, honey. Did I wake you up?
I'm sorry. I just couldn't sleep somehow.

632
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,471
It's all right.
Can I get you anything?

633
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,640
- Would you like some more coffee?
- No, I guess not.

634
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,392
Nice of you to offer though.

635
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,603
I don't know.
I'm just nervous and restless.

636
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,730
I'll be all right.
Go on back to bed, will you?

637
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,357
No, I won't.

638
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,609
Even if I don't get up
to get my husband's breakfast...

639
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,528
the least I can do is sit with him
while he has his coffee.

640
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,031
Ah, Sherry,
are you sure you feel all right?

641
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,492
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

642
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,953
I deserved it.

643
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:13,374
I know I've been irritable and moody lately,
and I haven't acted like I should.

644
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,584
It's just I can't stand living like this.

645
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,962
This crummy apartment
and a hamburger for dinner.

646
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,838
You haven't been so bad, baby.

647
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,507
Yes, I have.

648
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,550
But things are gonna be different.
You'll see.

649
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,970
When we get all that money
and have so many nice things...

650
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,889
I'll stop thinking about myself so much.

651
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,100
Your problems will be my problems -

652
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,811
whenever you're worried about something,
like now, for instance.

653
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,896
Is it the robbery?
Is that what you're worrying about?

654
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:40,067
Yeah, I guess it is a little. I have no reason to.
I know it's gonna be all right.

655
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:45,030
Ah, naturally you'd be a little upset
at a time like this.

656
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,366
It's today, isn't it?

657
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,078
What makes you think that? Just because
I couldn't sleep, it doesn't mean -

658
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,123
No, I know my Georgie.
He can't fool me.

659
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,792
I'm right, aren't I, darling?
Today is the day we get all that money.

660
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,128
No, you ain't. It isn't today.

661
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,756
If you don't stop pestering me,
trying to find out something
you have no reason to know...

662
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,508
there ain't gonna be no money.

663
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,886
- But, George, how can you -
- I mean it, Sherry! Now, I'm gettin' fed up.

664
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,889
You heard what Johnny told you -
to stop butting in, mind your own business...

665
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,766
or he'd call this whole thing off.

666
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,936
He told me something else too,
which I neglected to tell you.

667
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,606
That if I did "butt in," as you and he
choose to call it, he'd break my neck.

668
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,777
Maybe he had reason to. He wanted to make
you understand that he means business.

669
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,781
All I've gotta say is,
you've certainly changed your tune...

670
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,409
since he and his friends
slapped you around.

671
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,245
Well, I was pretty sore about that,
but, after all, what could they do?

672
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,665
You said yourself
they acted pretty reasonable.
We have no reason to hold a grudge.

673
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,500
Well, I'm not gonna argue with you, George.

674
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,795
If you let people beat you up, and then
take their side against your own wife, why -

675
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,090
But you did, Sherry! You said -
Look, I wanted to quit. You wouldn't let me.

676
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,342
You said I had no reason to.

677
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,805
Anyway, Johnny didn't lay a hand on me.
None of the guys did but Randy.

678
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,475
I was gonna tell you something
about your dear friend Johnny...

679
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,645
but since you feel about him like you do,
take his word against mine -

680
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,858
What about him?
What were you gonna tell me?

681
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,319
Let's stop the conversation right there.

682
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,030
What were you gonna tell me, Sherry?

683
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:12,076
I don't think I can tell you
when you feel like you do about him.

684
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,496
Not havin' any faith in me
and keepin' secrets.

685
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,956
We won't have any secrets.

686
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,708
What happened?

687
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:23,253
Well, I tried to tell you about this
the other night, but...

688
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,840
you were so upset, and every time
I tried to say anything, you cut me off.

689
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,593
Sherry, what are you trying to tell me?

690
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,931
I tried to stop him.
I pleaded and I struggled.

691
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,975
But -

692
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,394
Oh. It doesn't matter, does it, darling?

693
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:42,981
The only thing that really matters
is how I feel about you now, isn't it?

694
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,027
It is today, isn't it?

695
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,825
Earlier that morning, at 5:00 a. M...

696
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,035
Red Lightning was fed
only a half portion of feed...

697
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,996
in preparation for
the seventh race that afternoon -

698
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,874
the $100,000 Lansdowne Stakes.

699
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:08,132
At 7:00 that morning, Johnny Clay began
what might be the last day of his life.

700
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,468
Yeah. All right, all right.

701
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,721
Oh.

702
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,057
- What time is it?
- It's early yet. It's only 7:00.

703
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,351
You better go back to sleep after I leave.

704
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,812
I, uh, just wanted to say good-bye.

705
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,856
Till tonight, that is.

706
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,732
Everything's all set.
Should go perfectly.

707
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,443
But if it doesn't, if anything goes wrong,
why, don't talk about this with anyone.

708
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,447
You'll be in the clear for everything
except being short on your books,
and I don't think they'll be too rough on you.

709
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:36,743
Oh. I'm not worried about that. As a matter
of fact, I'm not worried about anything.

710
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,246
I just wish there was something more
I could do to help.

711
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,000
No, you've done your part.
I only hope we can do ours as well.

712
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,751
We, uh -

713
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:48,964
We'll probably never see each other
again after we split the money
and break up tonight, but...

714
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,008
in my book,
you'll always be a stand-up guy.

715
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,261
Johnny, I -

716
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,431
I don't know how to say this,
and I don't even know if I have the right...

717
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,560
but I've always thought maybe
you're like my own kid.

718
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,854
Ah, you can say anything you want.

719
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,274
You've had a lot of rough breaks,
and maybe you've made a few mistakes...

720
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,196
but after today, the good Lord willing,
you'll be a new man.

721
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,489
A rich man.

722
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,950
And that can make a lot of difference.

723
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,996
You got a lot of life ahead of you,
a lot of people to meet.

724
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,041
People of quality and substance.

725
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,792
What are you gettin' at?

726
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,712
Wouldn't it be great
if we could just go away, the two of us...

727
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,257
and let the old world
take a couple of turns...

728
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,844
and have a chance
to take stock of things?

729
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:41,141
It can be pretty serious and terrible,
particularly if it's not the right person.

730
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,893
Getting married, I mean.

731
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,730
You better go back to sleep.

732
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:51,193
The, uh, seventh race starts about 4:30
if you want to catch it on the radio.

733
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,278
I'll be back here about 7:00.

734
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,868
Keep away from the track.
Go to a movie or something.

735
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,371
- See you later.

736
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,670
It was exactly 7:00 a.m.
When he got to the airport.

737
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,466
The weight is okay, Mr. Preston.
Is that all the baggage?

738
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,886
Well, I'll have one more with me tonight.
I can keep it with me in the cabin, can't I?

739
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:21,181
Yes, sir, but be sure and check in here
at the counter prior to flight time.

740
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,393
- Flight 465 leaves at 9:00 p.m. Tonight.
- Thank you.

741
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,812
Thank you for flying American, sir.

742
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,735
Stopping first at a florist,
he arrived at the motel at 8:15.

743
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,779
He was on schedule.

744
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,907
- Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning, Joe.

745
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,369
Now, look, this afternoon a friend of mine
is stopping by and leaving a bundle for me.

746
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,870
- He's a cop.
- A cop?

747
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,206
Yeah, yeah.
He's, uh - drives a prowl car.

748
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,418
- A funny kind of a friend that you have.
- He's a funny kind of a cop.

749
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:52,045
Now, you let him in, huh?
He'll leave this bundle for me about 6:30.

750
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,965
I'll be by right after that and pick it up,
and that's the last you'll see of me.

751
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,884
- Would you come in for a drink?
- I'd like to, but I got a lot to do today.

752
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,971
- If I did that, everything would be fouled up.
- I understand. I'll see you tonight.

753
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,473
- Yeah. Okay.
- So long. Take care of yourself.

754
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,146
He reached the bus station at 8:45.

755
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,843
It was 9:20 when he arrived
at Mike's apartment.

756
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,763
So far everything had gone off
according to plan.

757
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,816
Mike O'Reilly was ready at 11:15.

758
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,820
What goes on here?
This is no way to get your strength back.

759
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:43,365
Oh, it's very good, Mike,
but I guess I'm just not hungry.

760
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,367
Really, I couldn't eat another bite.

761
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,953
Another?
You haven't eaten anything yet.

762
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:51,498
Well, I'll take something after a while,
after I've had my medicine.

763
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,417
I'll have more appetite then.

764
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,168
That's a promise.
No tricks now.

765
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,670
- It's a promise.

766
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,047
You'd better go along now, Mike,
or you'll be late for work.

767
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,924
Yeah, I guess I will.

768
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,845
Ruthie, things are gonna
get much better for us.

769
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,639
I know. I know, dear.

770
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,853
I know I've made a lot of promises in the past,
but this time it's not just talk.

771
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,855
We're gonna be rich, and soon.

772
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,858
You're gonna have a fine house
and doctors that'll make you well again.

773
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:21,403
Of course, dear. But you'd better
go along, Mike, or you'll be late.

774
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,405
Yeah.

775
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,951
- Oh, Mike?
- Yes?

776
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,704
On your way home tonight,
would you bring me some magazines?

777
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,122
Of course.

778
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,375
But, uh, Ruthie,
I'm going to be a little late.

779
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,463
Probably about 10:00. Some of the fellas
and me are having a little get-together.

780
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,006
I understand.

781
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,383
Don't you drink
too much beer, Mike.

782
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,635
Remember how
it always leaves you the next day.

783
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,431
Don't worry about that.
I won't be doing any drinking tonight.

784
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,395
I called Mother. She'll be over
this afternoon to fix your dinner.

785
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,022
Thank you, dear.

786
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,065
Good-bye.

787
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,985
Don't forget to eat your breakfast.

788
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,844
He reached the bus station at 11:29.

789
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:02,379
At 12:10, as it was his custom,
he arrived at the track.

790
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,144
Well, what do we got here?
Who's the girlfriend, Mike?

791
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,814
That's how you spend your money -
blowing your money on dames.

792
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,275
An old man like you
that oughta know better.

793
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,736
I ain't like you guys.
These posies are for my wife.

794
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:30,031
Besides, where do you guys get off
calling me an old man?

795
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,326
Why don't you buy your flowers
after you get through work, Mike?

796
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,495
Liable to wilt on you
before you get home.

797
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,664
Well, it can't be helped.

798
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,749
After work
the shops will all be closed.

799
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,043
Why don't you take 'em out
and put 'em in some water?

800
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,337
Or probably the clubhouse steward
would put 'em in the refrigerator for you.

801
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,506
- Why don't you do that?
- Well, perhaps I should.

802
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,884
But, well, it's getting
kinda late now, and -

803
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,013
- I'm all dressed. Why don't I do it for you?
- No.

804
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,682
What's the matter, Mike?
I was just trying to do you a favor.

805
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,352
These flowers are going in my locker.
Then I'll know where they are.

806
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,187
Okay, Mike. Suit yourself.

807
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,189
I'm sorry, Bill.
I appreciate your offer.

808
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,692
But after work you know how it is.

809
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,777
Everybody will be in a hurry
to get away, and -

810
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,477
Hi.

811
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,946
...is third, and Comfort King.

812
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,449
It is My Baby leading by a length.

813
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,577
Concentrator is second
by three quarters of a length.

814
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:02,582
Second Ending, moving up fast now
on the outside, is third, and Comfort King.

815
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,169
It is My Baby, Concentrator
and Second Ending.

816
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,756
It is Second Ending,
Concentrator and Comfort King.

817
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,633
It is Second Ending in front.

818
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,095
Down to the wire it's Second Ending,
the winner by a half a length!

819
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,849
Concentrator second by two,
Comfort King third, and My Baby.

820
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:25,438
The result of the first race
now appears on the totalizator board.

821
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:30,610
Be sure to hold all tickets
until the result of the race is declared official.

822
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,364
After the first race, Mike was very busy.

823
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,335
Gimme a double bourbon, please.

824
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,715
Don't you think
you've had enough, pal?

825
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,137
Your attention, please.

826
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:01,516
The horses are now on the track
for the second race at six furlongs.

827
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,519
At exactly 3:32 that same afternoon...

828
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:08,064
Officer Randy Kennan set in motion
his phase of the operation.

829
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,111
Hello, Fred. This is Randy.

830
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,196
Listen, pal, will you check
with the dispatcher's office...

831
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,198
and see if they've been getting me
loud and clear?

832
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,409
I think my set's
a little on the blink.

833
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,994
Sure.

834
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,374
Huh? What?

835
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,501
He says it's okay?

836
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,129
Well, that's funny.
It keeps going dead.

837
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,340
No, I don't think it's one of the tubes.
I'll keep fooling around with it.

838
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,719
Give my regards to your missus. By the way,
when's the big day supposed to be?

839
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,346
Well, don't worry about it.

840
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,432
The sixth one is always the hardest.

841
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:57,864
Officer!

842
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,242
- Oh, thank heaven. Hurry! Come quick!

843
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:04,120
They're killing each other!
I always knew they'd -

844
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,503
He had timed the trip to the track
on half a dozen different occasions...

845
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:14,923
and he knew atjust what point he should be
at precisely what time.

846
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,842
He knew the entire success of the plan
depended on his accuracy...

847
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,595
in arriving at the track
at exactly the correct moment.

848
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,224
A minute or two early was allowable,
but 10 seconds late would be fatal.

849
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,394
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

850
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:32,023
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

851
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:37,111
The $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes at one mile.

852
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,181
- They're off and running.

853
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,934
At the start it is Red Lightning
breaking on top.

854
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:12,313
Early Streak is second,
I'm Hoping is third, White Fire is fourth -

855
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,315
Earlier that afternoon at 2:30...

856
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,317
Maurice was at the chess club.

857
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:21,239
He was to be at the track in position at 4:00,
just before the start of the seventh race.

858
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,663
Fisher, I am supposed to be back here
tonight about 6:30.

859
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,207
If I'm not, I'd like you
to do something for me.

860
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,667
Sure, Maurice. What is it?

861
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,837
I'd like you to call this number
and ask for Mr. Stillman...

862
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,048
and tell him
Maurice requires his services.

863
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,843
Sounds pretty mysterious.
What's it all about?

864
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:46,180
There are some things, my dear Fisher,
which do not bear much looking into.

865
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,516
You have undoubtedly heard
of the Siberian goat herder...

866
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,185
who tried to discover
the true nature of the sun.

867
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,106
He stared up at the heavenly body
until it made him blind.

868
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,108
There are many things of this sort...

869
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,611
including love and death
and my business for today.

870
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,614
Please remember to make that call
if I'm not back at 6:30.

871
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,575
- Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

872
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,871
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race...

873
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:14,208
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes at one mile.

874
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,087
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

875
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:22,008
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race...

876
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:26,429
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes at one mile.

877
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,200
- Yes, sir?
- Bottle of beer.

878
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,785
Yes, sir.

879
00:54:51,956 --> 00:55:01,130
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

880
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,260
The horses are at the gate.

881
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,807
The horses are at the gate.

882
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:25,822
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig?

883
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,573
Hey, what's the matter with -

884
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,003
Hold him.

885
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,621
Come on, break it up. Look out.

886
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:03,878
It was exactly 4:23
when they dragged Maurice out.

887
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,256
At 11:40 that morning
Nikki left his farm.

888
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,064
He arrived at the track at 12:30.

889
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:34,033
- Hi there.
- Use the other parking lot, mister.
This one ain't open yet.

890
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:36,953
- I don't like to trouble you.
- You're not troubling me.

891
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,705
I said there's no parking here.
There's no parking, and that's that.

892
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,750
Look, Mac, I'm a paraplegic.

893
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,711
I want to get in this lot
to watch the races from my car.

894
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,630
That ain't my problem, mister.

895
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,925
My leg's bum, too,
but nobody's feeling sorry for me.

896
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,636
I know what you mean, buddy.

897
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,556
Get that in the war?

898
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,099
Battle of the Bulge.

899
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,519
Say, look, I know this is
a lot of extra trouble for you.

900
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,771
- I want you to have this.
- No, no, no. Skip it, skip it.

901
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,815
I want you to take it.

902
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,651
Now go on, keep it.

903
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,987
It's all right.

904
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,240
- Well, thanks a lot, mister. I'm sorry I -
- That's okay. Forget it.

905
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,242
Say, will you take down that fence?

906
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,912
I'd like to get settled down
before the first race starts. Okay?

907
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,497
Sure, mister.

908
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,443
Your attention, please.

909
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:54,322
The horses are now on the track
for the second race at six furlongs.

910
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,745
I had this layin' around, mister.
I thought you might like to have it.

911
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,914
Thanks.
That's very kind of you.

912
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,875
No trouble at all.
If you need anything else, just honk.

913
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:09,378
I doubt if I'll need anything.
I'm getting along just fine.

914
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,047
But thanks anyway.

915
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,633
Who you bettin' on, mister?
Anything look good to you?

916
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,551
- Red Lightning.
- Huh?

917
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:17,678
Red Lightning in the seventh.

918
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,682
- So you're bettin' on him, huh?
- Yeah, I got a little bet down on him.

919
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,477
Well, I guess I better be
getting back to work.

920
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,854
Yeah, well, thanks for
bringin' me the program.

921
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,941
No trouble at all. You sure
there's nothing else I can do for you?

922
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:34,320
No, nothing at all.
If I think of anything, I'll give you a yell.

923
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,720
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

924
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:03,432
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race...

925
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:08,104
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes at one mile.

926
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:16,612
The horses are approaching the starting gate
for the seventh race.

927
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,004
Sure is a nice day, ain't it?

928
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,505
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

929
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:38,384
I didn't figure it would be when I first got up
this morning, but it turned out real fine.

930
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,386
Kinda funny
when you stop to look at it.

931
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,681
Weather's almost the same
as it always is this time of year, but -

932
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,768
I sure appreciate the way
you treated me, mister.

933
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:51,272
It's not so much the money. Of course,
I appreciate that, too, but it's more the way -

934
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,232
Forget it.

935
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,569
No, sir, I - I don't reckon
I'll ever forget it.

936
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,239
I brought you some luck, mister. You bettin'
this race, I figure you might need it.

937
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,992
Now look. Keep your junk
and leave me alone, will you?

938
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,244
Some - Something wrong?

939
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,246
You're wrong, nigger.

940
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,958
Now, be a nice guy
and go on about your business.

941
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,835
Sure, boss.

942
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,379
Sorry to have bothered you.

943
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,131
My mistake.

944
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,395
- They're off and running!

945
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,939
At the start it is Red Lightning
breaking on top...

946
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,692
Early Streak is second,
I'm Hoping is third...

947
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,862
White Fire is fourth,
Little Arnie is next...

948
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,406
Seymour's Darling and Best Seller.

949
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,993
Moving down the back stretch,
it's Red Lightning by a length and a quarter...

950
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:48,954
I'm Hoping is second
by three quarters of a length...

951
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,957
Little Arnie is third
by a length and a quarter...

952
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,918
and Seymour's Darling.

953
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:57,797
Passing the half-mile post, it is Red Lightning
by a length and a quarter...

954
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,591
I'm Hoping is second
by a half a length...

955
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,802
Seymour's Darling is third...

956
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,887
and Little Arnie
moving fast on the outside.

957
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:09,975
Into the far turn, it is Red Lightning
in front by a length and a quarter.

958
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,728
Little Arnie is second
by half a length.

959
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,647
- I'm Hoping is third -

960
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,650
And a horse is down!
It is Red Lightning!

961
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,862
At the head of the stretch, it is I'm Hoping
taking the lead by half a length.

962
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:24,365
- Little Arnie driving on the outside.

963
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:28,369
Hey, stop! Stop, or I'll shoot!

964
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,749
It's Little Arnie!

965
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:38,003
Down to the wire it is Little Arnie
going steadily, holding it and winning it!

966
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,673
Nikki was dead at 4:24.

967
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,468
At 2:15 that afternoon
Johnny Clay was still in the city.

968
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:47,179
He knew exactly how long
it would take him to drive to the track...

969
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,348
park his car
and walk to the grandstand.

970
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:52,935
He planned to arrive just before
the start of the seventh race.

971
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,023
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

972
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:02,987
The horses are now on the track for
the seventh race, for the seventh race...

973

the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes at one mile.

The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

975
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,865
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig?

976
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,207
Money room. Carter.

977
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,292
Yes, sir. Right away.

978
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,419
There's a riot downstairs.
Come on.

979
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,785
They're off and running!

980
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,580

985
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,514
Little Arnie is third
by a length and a quarter...

986
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,558

I'm Hoping is third -

993
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:01,332
And a horse is down!
It is Red Lightning!

994
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:06,003
At the head of the stretch it is I'm Hoping
taking the lead by half a length.

995
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,548
Little Arnie, driving on the outside,
is second by three quarters...

996
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:13,177
Seymour's Darling is third,
and Early Streak.

997
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:17,181
It is Little Arnie and Seymour's Darling.
It's Little Arnie in front.

998
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:20,559
Down to the wire it is Little Arnie
going steadily, holding it...

999
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:24,021
and winning it

1000

Seymour's Darling
is third by a head...

1002
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,489
and White Fire finished fourth.

1003
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,744
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

1004
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,288
Be sure to hold all tickets.

1005
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:45,084
The stewards are conducting an inquiry
into the running of the seventh race...

1006
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,670
and will view the motion pictures.

1007
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,689
All right, get your hands up,
all of you! Now!

1008
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,358
One move out of any one of you,
and I'm gonna start firing.

1009
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:13,362
You. Fill that bag up
just as fast as you know how.

1010
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:21,203
You. Take that gun out of the holster.
Be awful, awful careful how you do it.

1011
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,211
Now drop it.

1012
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,464
- Kick it over here.

1013
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,218
All right, turn around
and face the wall.

1014
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,063
All right, now the money in the safe.

1015
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,236
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.

1016
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,864
We have received
no exact information...

1017
01:07:56,948 --> 01:08:00,325
concerning the spill of Red Lightning
in the seventh race.

1018
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,996
However, jockey Danny Freed
appears to be unhurt.

1019
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,750
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

1020
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,169
- We have received no exact information -
- Fill it up!

1021
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:14,047
Concerning the spill of Red Lightning
in the seventh race.

1022
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:17,718
However, jockey Danny Freed
appears to be unhurt.

1023
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,079
All right, all right, that's enough.

1024
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,665
Now put the bag here
in the middle of the floor.

1025
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,878
Get back over there.

1026
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,631
Now, I'm gonna open this door.

1027
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,926
I want you to go through it and go into the
locker room. And close the door after you.

1028
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,554
I'm gonna start firing through that door
15 seconds after you close the door.

1029
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,891
Let's go.

1030
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,901
Now close it!

1031
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,282
- Just a minute.
- What are you doing?

1032
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,075
Just stay right there.

1033
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,805
We interrupt this broadcast to
bring you a special news bulletin.

1034
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,309
In one of the most daring and methodically
executed holdups in criminal history...

1035
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,477
a lone bandit wearing a rubber mask...

1036
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,731
today took an estimated $2 million
stuffed into a large duffel bag...

1037
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,150
from the offices
of the Lansdowne Racetrack.

1038
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,360
The robbery occurred during
the running of the seventh race...

1039
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:43,614
and was apparently timed to coincide
with the shooting of Red Lightning...

1040
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,158
just as the horse, valued at
a quarter of a million dollars...

1041
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,285
was leading the pack at the far turn.

1042
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,913
The jockey, Danny Freed,
escaped with minor injuries.

1043
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:54,708
A man identified as Nikki Arano,
who allegedly shot the prize thoroughbred...

1044
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,960
was himself fatally wounded
by track police...

1045
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:59,713
as he attempted to shoot his way
out of the track parking lot.

1046
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:03,258
At this time the most baffling mystery
that still plagues the authorities...

1047
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,511
is just how the bandit managed to
successfully get away from the track...

1048
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,014
with the bulky duffel bag
containing the money.

1049
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,808
A painstaking search of the track grounds
is being conducted...

1050
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,519
on the theory that the money
may still be hidden there.

1051
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,022
And now we take you back
to our regularly scheduled program.

1052
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,944
No one saw the duffel bag
come out of the window.

1053
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,284
Nah, that part of it worked okay.
Landed right at my feet.

1054
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:34,373
I reported my radio out of order
before I went out to the track.

1055
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,584
But the captain ain't buying it. He's convinced
I was holed up somewhere, drunk.

1056
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:41,421
And if the captain's convinced,
there ain't nobody that can unconvince him.

1057
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:47,552
Besides, no one's gonna think anything
of seein' a cop at the racetrack.

1058
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:52,140
I mean, they won't get any funny ideas
about it and tie it in with the robbery.

1059
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,728
Anyway, if they do
it won't cut any ice.

1060
01:11:56,813 --> 01:12:00,816
Captain knows I was drunk,
and he ain't a man you can argue with.

1061
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,904
So I guess I'll just have to break down,
admit it and take my punishment.

1062
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,615
Yeah. That would be terrible,
wouldn't it, Randy?

1063
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,492
A 30-day suspension.

1064
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,744
It's 7:15.

1065
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,330
Don't worry.
He'll get here.

1066
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:18,875
He had to pick up the dough at the motel
where I dropped it.

1067
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,294
There was a funny little guy
name of Joe Piano there.

1068
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,213
He runs the place, I guess.

1069
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,382
Sure hope Johnny
knows how to pick his friends.

1070
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,384
I need another drink.

1071
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,763
Why ain't he here?

1072
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:35,559
Everything else runs on a timetable
till it comes to payin' us our shares.

1073
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,853
Then the timetable breaks down.

1074
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,772
He's supposed to be here at 7:00.

1075
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,404
- I think I hear the elevator.
- That'll be Johnny.

1076
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,406
Yeah.

1077
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,288
- All right, everybody up.
- What is this?

1078
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,957
It'll be a massacre
if you don't keep those mitts up.

1079
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,168
Now, where's Johnny?
What time's he due?

1080
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,589
Look, I been sitting on that car since 4:00
listenin' to that radio...

1081
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,632
and I heard
some pretty interesting things.

1082
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,343
Grandpa, tell me,
what time's Johnny getting here?

1083
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:12,345
Somebody gave you
a bum steer, buddy.

1084
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,473
Look around.

1085
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:18,727
Can't believe you were tipped, huh?
Well, if I had a certain little lady here -

1086
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,645
Where's the jerk?
Where's George?

1087
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,481
The jerk's right -

1088
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:57,099
Forty minutes before,
at 6:25, Johnny reached the motel.

1089
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:00,936
Due to heavy traffic around the track,
he was 15 minutes behind schedule.

1090
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,608
Yeah? Who is it?

1091
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,862
Oh, it's, uh - it's just a mistake.
I'm sorry.

1092
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:40,100
Johnny arrived at the meeting place at 7:29,
still 15 minutes late.

1093
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,319
It had been prearranged
and agreed to by all...

1094
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,780
that in the event of an emergency
before the split...

1095
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:56,908
the money was to be saved by whoever
had possession of it at that time...

1096
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,452
without any consideration
of the fate of the others...

1097
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:02,497
the money to be divided in safety
at a later date.

1098
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:06,418
After what he had seen, and not knowing the
cause or the circumstances of the others...

1099
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,254
Johnny had no choice
but to save himself and the money.

1100
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:21,266
Ten minutes later he bought
the largest suitcase he could find.

1101
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,258
I'm back here, Val darling.

1102
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,095
How'd it go, dear?

1103
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,684
Watch out there! Watch out!

1104
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,686
- What happened?

1105
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,690
Sherry, why?
Why did you do it?

1106
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:54,192
Do? Do what, dearest?
I don't know what you're talking about.

1107
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:57,028
I was just getting some clothes
ready to go to the cleaners. I -

1108
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,030
Hello! Hi there!

1109
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,326
So you had to be stupid.

1110
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,955
You couldn't even play it smart
with a gun pointed at you.

1111
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,458
Well, you better get smart fast
and get outta here while you can still walk.

1112
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:15,088
But your friend -
Val? Is that his name?

1113
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:18,049
Yes, and you'd better get out of here
before he gets here.

1114
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,303
I - I'm sick, Sherry. I -

1115
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,639
Call an ambulance.

1116
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,979
The door's behind you.
Take a cab.

1117
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:34,107
I love you, Sherry.

1118
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,736
George, you better go on and go.
You look terrible.

1119
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,201
It isn't fair.

1120
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,121
I never had anybody but you.

1121
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,416
Not a real husband.

1122
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,544
Not even a man.

1123
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,841
Just a bad joke without a punch line.

1124
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,641
Ain't fair. Ain't fair.

1125
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,786
American Airlines announces the arrival...

1126
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:33,500
of Flight 808
DC-7 service from Chicago.

1127
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,294
American Airlines
announces the arrival...

1128
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:40,632
of Flight 808
DC-7 service from Chicago.

1129
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,398
Sebastian and I are so excited.

1130
01:18:56,482 --> 01:19:00,443
We haven't seen Daddy Sweetums
for such a long, long time.

1131
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:04,322
Will the nice man let us wait outside
so we can look at the airplanes?

1132
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,324
Why, certainly. You can stand
outside on the boarding ramp.

1133
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,285
We'll be announcing the arrival
of your husband's flight very shortly.

1134
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,122
He's a sweetums man, isn't hims?

1135
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:15,875
Let's hurry up real fast
and see Daddy come off the airplane.

1136
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,962
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1137
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:22,257
Mr. And Mrs. Raymond Preston,
9:00 flight for Boston.

1138
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,842
Mm-hmm.

1139
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,513
We'll be announcing the on-time departure
of this flight very shortly, sir.

1140
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,849
- Fine.
- Do you have any other baggage?

1141
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,851
No, it was already
checked through this morning.

1142
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,854
Oh, say, I, uh - I wanna carry that bag
with me on the plane, please.

1143
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,107
I'm sorry, sir. It's much too large. This'll
have to go checked through at Baggage.

1144
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:43,153
Oh, now, uh, let's, uh -
let's be a little reasonable, huh?

1145
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,321
You can't tell me that the two of us
traveling together...

1146
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,782
are not entitled to one piece
of luggage between us.

1147
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,785
Sir, we have no objection
to one small bag or even two small bags.

1148
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,371
But we don't have anything else.
It's already been checked through.

1149
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:54,914
I see.

1150
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:58,501
Even though it's getting very close
to flight time I think we can
locate the rest of your luggage.

1151
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:00,712
You could transfer some of the contents
in this one to a smaller one.

1152
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:05,300
No. I'm sorry, that won't work at all. Now
look, uh, let me talk to your supervisor, huh?

1153
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,385
All right.
I'll be very happy to call him.

1154
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,137
Mr. Grimes!

1155
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,639
Mr. Grimes? Could you
come down this way, please?

1156
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,643
Good evening, sir.
What can we do for you?

1157
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,770
Good evening. My wife and I
are going through to Boston.

1158
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:21,357
The rest of our luggage has already been
checked through, and I want to take
this bag with me in the cabin, please.

1159
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,568
I'm afraid it exceeds the maximum cabin size
for flight requirements, sir.

1160
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:27,238
Yes, it does look quite a bit too large
for the passenger compartment.

1161
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,575
Sir, those are our flight regulations which
are designed for your comfort and safety.

1162
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,703
- Well, I can't make the trip without it.
- You, uh, really can't, hmm?

1163
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,205
Absolutely not.

1164
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:38,082
Well, in that case, I think we can, uh -
How about it, Brown?

1165
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,751
I know it's past cancellation time...

1166
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,837
but under the circumstances
I think we might stretch a point, don't you?

1167
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:45,048
We'll give you a full rebate
on your ticket, sir.

1168
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,592
Wait a minute.
I - I don't want a rebate!

1169
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,345
Well, sir, I - I don't know
what else to suggest.

1170
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,931
It's very close to flight time.
There are other passengers waiting.

1171
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:55,266
Perhaps the gentleman is worried
about the contents of the bag. Is that it?

1172
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,602
- We'd be very happy to insure it.
- More than happy. We'd be delighted.

1173
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:00,271
- No.
- If you could just give me its estimated value
and tell me what's in it.

1174
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:04,442
No, there's nothing in it. I mean, uh,
just personal items, things like that.

1175
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:08,112
All right. All right.
Check it through.

1176
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:09,864
Passengers may now board -
- Thank you, sir.

1177
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,617
- I'm sure you'll find the service
to your complete satisfaction.
- American Airlines Flight 40...

1178
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:16,788
the New Englander
DC-7 service to Boston...

1179
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,540
at Gate 8.

1180
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:24,420
Passengers may now board
American Airlines Flight 40 -

1181
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:47,193
No, no, Sebastian.

1182
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,654
Mustn't frighten pretty airplanes.

1183
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,241
We go for trip
on nice airplane someday.

1184
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,219
- Sebastian, come back here!

1185
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:48,588
Come on. Come, darling.
Come to Mama. Naughty boy.

1186
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,598
Mr. Preston,
we'll be announcing boarding -

1187
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:03,478
Grimes speaking.

1188
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,396
What?

1189
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,482
Oh, well, you're not serious?

1190
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,735
Right out on the runway?

1191
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,487
Yes, sir, right away.

1192
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,663
Will passenger Preston please report...

1193
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,832
to the American Airlines
ticket counter.

1194
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:28,086
Will passenger Preston
please report...

1195
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,963
to the American Airlines
ticket counter.

1196
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,590
Taxi!

1197
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:47,188
Johnny, look.

1198
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:57,365
Johnny, you've got to run.

1199
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,075
Yeah.

1200
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,202
What's the difference?
