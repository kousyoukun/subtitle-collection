1
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,498
And they're off
and running!

2
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,536
Seattle breaking on top.
Purple Shadow is second.

3
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:04,307
At exactly 3:45
on that Saturday afternoon...

4
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:06,315
in the last week of September...

5
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:09,978
Marvin Unger was perhaps the only one
among the 100,000 people at the track...

6
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,886
who felt no thrill
at the running of the sixth race.

7
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:15,220
He was totally disinterested
in horse racing...

8
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,556
and held a lifelong contempt
for gambling.

9
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:21,791
Nevertheless, he had a five-dollar win
bet on every horse in the fifth race.

10
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:24,390
He knew, of course, that this
rather unique system of betting...

11
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,959
would more than likely result
in a loss, but he didn't care.

12
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:31,269
For after all, he thought, what would
the loss of $20 or $30 mean...

13
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:34,833
in comparison to the vast sum
of money ultimately at stake?

14
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:38,506
- A bottle of ginger ale, please.
- Yes, sir. Comin' right up.

15
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:45,350
Favorite broke bad.
Could be anybody's race.

16
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,447
Could be.

17
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:51,551
A five-dollar win
next to the five-dollar place.

18
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:57,529
- Quite a crowd you got.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,297
Passing the quarter pole,
it is Lucky Arrow and Purple Shadow...

20
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:05,171
with Stopwatch
on the outside to third.

21
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:08,972
At the head of the stretch,
it is Purple Shadow leading by a length.

22
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:11,536
Lucky Arrow is second,
behind by a quarter.

23
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:15,141
Stopwatch moving up on the outside
by a length and a quarter.

24
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:17,982
Then comes Southern Star,
Baynard Brit, Stanley Eight...

25
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:20,079
Third Row and Lovely Dilemma.

26
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,920
lt is Lucky Arrow leading by a head.

27
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:26,792
Purple Shadow by a header and
Stopwatch moving fast on the outside.

28
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:30,128
lt's Lucky Arrow, Purple Shadow,
Stopwatch neck and neck.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,760
lt's Lucky Arrow, Purple Shadow
and Stopwatch.

30
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:37,101
lt's Stopwatch taking the lead.

31
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:39,038
lt's Stopwatch by a head.

32
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,840
Purple Shadow second by a head,
Lucky Arrow third by a length...

33
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,972
and Southern Star finished fourth.

34
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,897
Waiting for the race
to become official...

35
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,907
he began to feel
as if he had as much effect...

36
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,068
on the final outcome
of the operation...

37
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,635
as a single piece
a jumbo jigsaw puzzle has...

38
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,840
to its predetermined final design.

39
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:21,315
Only the addition of
the missing fragments of the puzzle...

40
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:25,218
would reveal whether the picture was
as he guessed it would be.

41
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,518
The result of the sixth race
is now declared to open.

42
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,776
Twenty-five dollars.

43
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,519
About an hour earlier that same
Saturday afternoon in September...

44
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:59,521
in another part of the city...

45
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,454
Patrolman First Class Randy Kennon...

46
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,186
had some personal business
to attend to.

47
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,626
Hiya, Tony. What's the good word?

48
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:09,062
Same as always-- havin' a ball.

49
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,895
See you later.

50
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,069
Good evening, Randy.
How have things been?

51
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,804
What's the use of kickin', Leo?
You wouldn't believe it, anyway.

52
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:25,143
l suppose that we're very well.

53
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:28,742
After all, a man drives a new car,
lives in a fine apartment.

54
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:31,810
So l like to live good.
You got any objections?

55
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:33,879
None at all...

56
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,721
as long as you don't overlook
your obligation to me.

57
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,057
l trust it was purely an oversight.

58
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,791
l'm sure a man in your position
wouldn't deliberately antagonize...

59
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,390
his creditors.

60
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:47,061
l ain't got it.
l know l should have it.

61
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,663
l'm as anxious to pay you off as you
are to have me, but l ain't got it.

62
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,074
Well, we all get a little cramped
now and then.

63
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:59,080
Suppose we make it a thousand.
l'll rewrite the balance as a new loan.

64
00:05:59,148 --> 00:06:01,013
Give you a fresh start.

65
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:04,178
Listen. l'm broke. Get me?
Flat broke.

66
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:08,190
l couldn't give you 1,000 cents,
but if you can wait a couple of weeks--

67
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:11,955
Might be arranged,
with the proper collateral, of course.

68
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,792
You mean, where's the dough
comin' from? l can't tell you.

69
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:19,198
All l can tell you is, it's a sweet deal
and l'll be able to pay off.

70
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,998
- ln two weeks? No longer?
- Maybe even less than that.

71
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:27,668
You know l wouldn't pull a thing
like this on you. l couldn't afford to.

72
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,375
l'm glad you said that.

73
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,414
l was going to point out as much...

74
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,950
but since you relieved me
of the unpleasant necessity--

75
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:38,715
lt's a deal then? l pay you the 2,600
within the next two weeks.

76
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,191
Plus $400, a total of 3,000.
The extra interest, of course.

77
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,659
l trust that'll be satisfactory.

78
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,161
l couldn't say no.

79
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,393
Thank you.
l was sure you'd see it my way.

80
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:54,128
Take good care of yourself.

81
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:56,569
l'll take care of myself, mister.

82
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,698
That's my specialty.

83
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:01,141
At 7:00 p.m. that same day...

84
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,771
Johnny Clay, perhaps the most important
thread in the unfinished fabric...

85
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:06,838
furthered its design.

86
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,510
None of these men are criminals
in the usual sense.

87
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,178
They've all got jobs.

88
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,587
They all live seemingly normal,
decent lives, but...

89
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:18,354
they got their problems, and they've
all got a little larceny in 'em.

90
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:21,955
You take my pal Unger, for instance,
the guy who owns this apartment...

91
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:25,990
he's putting up the money to operate
with him and he's letting me stay here.

92
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,969
He's a bookkeeper.

93
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,699
Been with the same company
for ten years.

94
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:34,470
You know, Fay, the biggest mistake
l made before was shooting for peanuts.

95
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:37,707
Five years have taught me one thing,
if nothing else:

96
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,476
Anytime you take a chance, you better be
sure the rewards are worth the risk.

97
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,213
They can put you away just as fast for
a $10 heist as for a million-dollar job.

98
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:46,812
You don't have to sell it
to me, Johnny.

99
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,323
You know l'll go along
with anything you say.

100
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:52,555
l always have, you know,
ever since we were kids.

101
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,655
l've always believed you,
everything you've ever told me.

102
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:58,867
Those five years you been away...

103
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:02,234
l know they must've been
terrible for you.

104
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:07,242
l mean, being locked up
must be a terrible thing.

105
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:10,509
You know something?

106
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,344
This may sound funny, but...

107
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,943
waiting for you all those years
and staying by myself...

108
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,954
it was like...

109
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:22,617
not that you were locked in,
but l was locked out.

110
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,452
Well, look at me.

111
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,361
First time we've been together
in five years, and l'm making speeches.

112
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,026
Now, now. Everything is gonna be
all right, l promise you.

113
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:34,194
Make sure you're right about it.

114
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,204
l'm no good for anybody else.

115
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:41,107
l'm not pretty and not very smart,
so please don't leave me alone anymore.

116
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:44,271
Now, nothing is going to happen,
not this time.

117
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:48,476
l guess l better leave you be now.

118
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:51,486
l know you've got a lot of work to do.

119
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:55,284
- When will l see you again?
- Saturday night.

120
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,986
We'll be on the plane together.

121
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:01,224
Until it's over, l want you
to stay out of the way.

122
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:05,666
- lf there's anything l can do to help.
- No. Just make the plane reservations.

123
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,726
Remember, tell them at the office
that you're leaving.

124
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,669
Tell them you're getting married.

125
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,299
l don't want to say good-bye.

126
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:18,937
- We were just talking about you.
- Hi, Johnny. Hi, Miss Fay.

127
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:21,006
- Hello.
- l hope it was something nice.

128
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,747
Yes. Johnny was telling me
about what a wonderful friend you were.

129
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:28,018
- Fay was just leaving.
- Don't rush off on my account.

130
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:30,821
- She's late for an appointment.
- That's right.

131
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:34,954
- You be sure to call me.
- l'll do just what l told you l would.

132
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:42,193
lt was nice to see you again, Mr. Unger.
Take care of Johnny.

133
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,637
There's nothing
l wouldn't do for Johnny.

134
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,368
l'll see you.

135
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,138
A half an hour earlier
at approximately 6:30...

136
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:53,705
Mike O'Reilly,
the track bartender, came home.

137
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:55,648
Ruthie, l'm home.

138
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,746
At 7:15 that same night...

139
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:37,315
George Peatty, the track cashier,
arrived at his apartment.

140
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:50,131
- Feeling okay?
- Fine.

141
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:53,369
l've been kind of sick today.
l keep getting pains in my stomach.

142
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,377
Maybe you got a hole in it, George.
Do you suppose you have?

143
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:59,039
How would l get a hole
in my stomach?

144
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:02,141
How would you get one in your head?
Fix me a drink.

145
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,982
l think l'm developing
some pains myself.

146
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:08,922
Sherry, can't l ever say anything at all
without you joking me about it?

147
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:12,586
Hurry up with that drink.
The pains are gettin' worse.

148
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,998
l saw somethin' kind of nice
comin' home on the train tonight.

149
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,557
Somethin', well, kind of sweet.

150
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,728
A candy bar, George?

151
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:24,204
No, not a candy bar, darn it.

152
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:28,672
lt was people.

153
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:33,015
This couple sittin'
just in front of me.

154
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:36,483
They weren't young exactly.
l guess the woman was about your age.

155
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:40,784
A little senile, you mean, with
one foot and a big toe in the grave?

156
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,223
You want to hear this or not?

157
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,352
l can't wait.
Go ahead and thrill me.

158
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,092
Anyway, they were sittin' in front of me
and l could hear what they were sayin'.

159
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,793
Well, part of it.

160
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:55,235
- They weren't young exactly--
- She was about my age, you said.

161
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:59,331
Not anymore. Maybe she was when you
started telling this story, but not now.

162
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:02,502
Anyway, she was calling him Papa,
and he was calling her Mama.

163
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,174
The climax to this exciting story?
The moral, the punch line?

164
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,619
Forget it. l just thought l'd tell you
about it, but l might've known.

165
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:14,815
l know. You want to bet l know?
l'll give you seven to five.

166
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,018
Cut it out, will you?

167
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,186
l'm tired.
l don't feel so good.

168
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:23,665
You want me to call you Papa,
and you want to call me Mama?

169
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,724
- You know all the answers.
- Go right ahead.

170
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,634
lt may be the last word you ever say,
but l'll try to kill you as painlessly--

171
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,901
l gotta go out tonight. l don't suppose
there's anything for dinner.

172
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,966
Of course there is.
There are all sorts of things.

173
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:38,445
- We have steak, asparagus and potatoes.
- l don't smell nothin'.

174
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:41,005
That figures, 'cause you're
too far away from it.

175
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,847
- Too far away?
- You don't think l had it all cooked.

176
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,912
lt's all down in the shopping center.

177
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,219
Tell me somethin',
would you, Sherry?

178
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,783
Just tell me one thing.

179
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:54,227
Why did you ever marry me, anyway?

180
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:58,791
When a man has to ask his wife that,
well, he just hadn't better.

181
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:02,395
Why talk about it? Maybe it's
all to the good in the long run.

182
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,405
After all, if people
didn't have headaches...

183
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,407
what would happen
to the aspirin industry?

184
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,739
You used to love me.
You said you did, anyway.

185
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,405
l seem to recall you made
a memorable statement too--

186
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,972
something about hitting it rich and
having an apartment on Park Avenue...

187
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:17,747
and a different car
for every day of the week.

188
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,311
Not that l really care
about such things...

189
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,983
as long as l have a big, handsome,
intelligent brute like you.

190
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,495
lt would make a difference, wouldn't it?
lf l had money, l mean.

191
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,496
How would you define ""money""?

192
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:30,998
lf you're thinking of giving me
your collection of Roosevelt dimes--

193
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:34,127
l mean, big money--
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

194
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:37,400
You really don't feel well. Are you
sure that pain's in your stomach?

195
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:40,067
l'm gonna have it--
hundreds of thousands.

196
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,337
Maybe a half a million.

197
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:45,346
Of course you are. Did you put
the right address on the envelope...

198
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,348
when you sent it to the North Pole?

199
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,907
Go ahead and laugh. Wait and see.

200
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:53,581
Maybe you won't be laughing so hard
in a few days.

201
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:56,989
You're serious. You really think
you're gonna have a lot of money.

202
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,220
l don't think nothin'. l know it.

203
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:03,197
You've never been a liar. You don't
have enough imagination to lie.

204
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,031
What makes you think you're gonna have
several hundred thousand dollars?

205
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,005
- 'Cause l do. l can't talk about it.
- Not even to me, your little Sherry?

206
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:13,041
l shouldn't even have mentioned
l was going to have it.

207
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:16,374
lt's not that l mind. l know l can
trust you, but if these other guys--

208
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,106
""These other guys""?

209
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,410
l can't talk about it, Sherry.

210
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,386
ls that why you're going out tonight?
To meet with them?

211
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:28,014
They got nothin' to do with that.
l just got to go uptown for a while.

212
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,615
l see.
Well, you go right ahead.

213
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:33,628
lf you want to act that way,
l certainly won't try to stop you.

214
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:36,631
Now, Sherry, honey,
don't be sore at me.

215
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:40,533
When a woman's been married five years
and her husband doesn't trust her--

216
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:43,197
You think more of them
than you do of me.

217
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,763
What right have you got
to say a thing like that?

218
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:49,333
You know l'm crazy about you.
l'd do anything in the world for you.

219
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:52,176
You're the one l'm doing it for.
lf l didn't love you so much--

220
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:55,012
l don't want you to do
anything for me.

221
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,177
Go up and see your fellow--
whatever you want to do.

222
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:02,480
Don't you be surprised
if l'm not here when you get home.

223
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:05,925
You better be here.
You hear me? You will be, won't you?

224
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,862
You wouldn't do anything foolish,
would you?

225
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,695
l certainly wouldn't want to,
but as long as you don't trust me...

226
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,031
or have the slightest bit
of faith in me--

227
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:17,766
- lf l ever found you with another man--
- You have no use for me.

228
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,809
You say you do, but when it comes
to a showdown, or proving it...

229
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:23,811
you say one thing
and then you do the opposite.

230
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:29,377
Well, l could tell you a little bit
about it, l guess...

231
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:31,147
or most of it.

232
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,587
- But you got to promise to keep quiet.
- Why, of course, darling.

233
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,617
Just a second.

234
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:42,559
- Well!
- Hello.

235
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:47,131
-How'd you get away from George tonight?
-He had to go somewhere.

236
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:49,501
That's a break.
l'm glad you called me.

237
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,970
Somethin' wrong, baby?

238
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:56,238
No, nothing's wrong.

239
00:15:56,312 --> 00:16:00,248
- Can l get you a drink?
- No, l don't think so.

240
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:03,513
Come on, now.
That's not my baby.

241
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:06,282
- Val, l called you last night.
- Yeah?

242
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:08,846
- There was no answer.
- l guess l stepped out.

243
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:12,360
- l called you four times.
- l guess l was out somewhere.

244
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,453
Oh? What'd you do?

245
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,795
l guess l was goofin' off
at a movie or somethin'.

246
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,131
Why are you doing this to me?

247
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:23,399
- l don't know what you mean.
- l think you do.

248
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,770
Oh, look, Mrs. Peatty...

249
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:28,105
what l do is my own business.

250
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,111
l never tried to pin you down.

251
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,943
l never asked you how you
got your kicks before you met me.

252
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,609
That hurt. You didn't used
to talk to me like that.

253
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:39,450
l'm sorry, baby. But don't bug me.
l gotta live my life a certain way.

254
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:42,184
l can't stand it
when the walls start closin' in.

255
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:46,422
- But you know how crazy l am about you.
- And l'm crazy about you too.

256
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:49,259
l've given you
sufficient proof of that.

257
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:51,925
lt's just that lately
every time l call--

258
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,765
So l step out once in a while.
You got yourself a husband.

259
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:57,271
The guy'll spend
every last nickel on you.

260
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,933
He won't ask you any questions when you
come home from an afternoon movie...

261
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:01,704
at 9:00 at night.

262
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:04,610
- Don't be greedy.
- l'm not greedy. l'm in love with you.

263
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,774
lf that's being greedy,
then l'm the biggest glutton on Earth.

264
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,944
Don't make it sound so ominous. You
sound like you're gonna eat me alive.

265
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,783
l might just do that.

266
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:20,024
Darling, what are the two things in life
you're most interested in?

267
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,960
- What?
- Money and women?

268
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:24,124
That's a nice way to put me down.

269
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,397
- That about sums it up, doesn't it?
- We'll let it stand.

270
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:30,836
But l imagine what you really meant
to say was ""money and woman.""

271
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:35,002
We're gonna have money, more money than
you've dreamed of-- maybe even millions.

272
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:37,739
- Yeah? How?
- George, that's how.

273
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,781
He's stumbled onto somethin' big.

274
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:42,646
- That meatball?
- Meatball with gravy, Val.

275
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,709
You know he works at the track.

276
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:47,984
Somehow-- and don't ask me how--
he's got connected with the mob.

277
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:51,390
They're gonna rob the track offices
for the day's receipts.

278
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,987
He seriously told you he and some mob
are gonna knock over the racetrack?

279
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:58,659
You can believe him, 'cause George
may be a fool, but he's not a liar.

280
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:01,259
The guy's crazy.
That's never been done before.

281
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:05,171
l told him that, but he says the job's
all set up and it's gonna be done.

282
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:09,109
And if l just sit tight, l'd be
up to my curls in cash just like that.

283
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:14,940
Let's suppose this is all true.
How do l fit in?

284
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,783
Well, you know l'm gonna leave George.
l guess you know why too.

285
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:22,187
You've been sayin' that
for a long, long time.

286
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,258
Everything's changed now.
l was gonna tell him tonight.

287
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,626
George may be very rich very soon.

288
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,631
That's all he needs, isn't it?

289
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,690
He'd still be George.

290
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,703
So you think-- let's say,
George and his boys...

291
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,740
pull this job
and George gets his cut--

292
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,503
maybe l could take it
away from him, huh?

293
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:43,374
l think you could.

294
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:47,404
What about the others?
Any idea who they are?

295
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:50,577
Only this. l went through his clothes
while he was showering.

296
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:53,588
l'm quite sure
George went there tonight.

297
00:18:55,658 --> 00:18:58,525
Kiddo, l think we got somethin' here.

298
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,825
lf this is true, this is
a lot bigger than you think.

299
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:04,593
You're interested in takin'
Georgie's cut? l got news for you.

300
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,659
Georgie's cut's gonna be peanuts
compared to this whole thing.

301
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:10,500
We gotta find out more
about the overall plan.

302
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,733
- You think he'll tell you any more?
- Not a chance.

303
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:16,039
l could see he was scared
'cause he talked as much as he did.

304
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,274
l don't get it, Johnny,
about these two other guys.

305
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:25,817
There's gonna be two other guys,
and we ain't gonna know who they are?

306
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:29,051
That's right. You don't know who they
are, and they don't know who you are.

307
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:32,059
- That makes sense, doesn't it?
- l guess so, but--

308
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,220
Makes sense to me, all right.

309
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,287
What are they gonna do?

310
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,299
One of them's for
the job with the rifle.

311
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,801
None of you boys can handle that,
even if you were willing to.

312
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,803
The other one starts the fight
in the bar.

313
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:46,637
These other fellows, how much they
cuttin' in for. Not that l mind?

314
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:49,007
These men are not gonna be in
on the basic scheme.

315
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:51,171
They're getting paid to perform
certain definite duties...

316
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:54,477
at a certain definite time,
and they're not cutting in on the take.

317
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,916
They'll be paid a flat price
to do a straight job.

318
00:19:56,985 --> 00:20:00,477
lf they don't know anything about
the basic plan, why are they doin' it?

319
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:03,252
Simple. These boys are straight hoods.
They get paid in advance--

320
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:05,657
five grand for the one with the rifle,
2,500 for the other.

321
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:09,186
- Where's this money comin' from?
- That's where Marvin comes in.

322
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:12,631
He's getting the 7,500 for us,
and he gets it back off the top.

323
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,669
l wish l could do more.

324
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:17,399
lt's almost not right for me
to get as much as everybody else.

325
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:20,567
- After all, all l do is--
- Your money counts for plenty.

326
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:24,772
-You don't hear any of them complaining.
-You're okay in our book, Marv.

327
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,509
But if these two hoods
get paid in advance...

328
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,608
how do you know
they're gonna do their jobs?

329
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:32,279
l'll vouch for 'em.
These guys are pros.

330
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:36,256
They can't afford to weasel out.
lf they did, they'd be washed up.

331
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:38,259
Any other questions?

332
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:42,155
Let's take a look at this, then.

333
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:46,497
This is a rough drawing of the track
as l remember it.

334
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:50,129
Randy, you'll have to get me
an A-1 street map of the whole district.

335
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:54,437
George, Mike, l want you to go over
this thing with me inch by inch.

336
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,707
Bring it completely up to date.
Add or subtract the slightest change...

337
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,374
even if it's somethin' as small
as the placing of a hot dog stand.

338
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,144
Now, give or take a few thousand...

339
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,313
l figure the loot on this deal
at two million.

340
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:11,158
There should be that much
in the track offices.

341
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,490
That includes profits
on the pari-mutuel betting...

342
00:21:13,562 --> 00:21:16,531
the breakage money,
taxes from the mutuel machines...

343
00:21:16,598 --> 00:21:19,999
receipts from the concessions
and the money from ticket sales.

344
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,161
None of this money
is allowed to accumulate...

345
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,171
at any one point around the track.

346
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,833
Except for money to make change with
and the mutuel clerks' payoff money...

347
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:28,900
it all goes into the office.

348
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:31,741
Out of the entire take,
only a few thousand dollars...

349
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:34,282
is put in the office safe
to cover emergencies.

350
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:37,750
The rest is out in the open,
held for pickup by armored car.

351
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,754
That car arrives about 5:00...

352
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:42,848
and parks directly in front
of the entrance to the clubhouse.

353
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:46,361
Two men stay in it-- one at the wheel,
the other at a machine gun.

354
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,692
Two others enter the office
to collect the dough.

355
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:51,028
They're armed, and so are
the track detectives who cover them...

356
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,828
from the car to the office and back.

357
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:56,029
Once the armored car arrives,
a stickup is--

358
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,206
is out of the question.

359
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:28,732
What in the name of Pete would a babe
be doin' outside the door?

360
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:31,170
What do you think?

361
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,731
Any of you
ever see this woman before?

362
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:35,174
lt's Sherry, my wife.

363
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:38,111
Why, you, you been talkin'.
You spilled to her.

364
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,842
l did not.
What, do you think l'm crazy?

365
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,508
You jerk. You clown!

366
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,848
Come on, clown.
Sing us a chorus from ""Pagliacci.""

367
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,083
You better talk. Come clean.
Talk, or we'll get it out of her.

368
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:50,681
You wouldn't do anything
to hurt her, Johnny, please.

369
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,852
l don't want to, but if you
won't tell us what you told her--

370
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,523
l didn't tell her nothin'.
Why would l do a thing like that?

371
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:58,429
Sure, she wouldn't.

372
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,263
She's just the building inspector.

373
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:03,031
She just stopped outside that door
to measure the keyhole.

374
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:05,733
Let's have it, George.
We're gonna get it outta one of you.

375
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:09,743
lf you didn't tell her,
then why was she around here snoopin'?

376
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:13,144
She must've found the address
in my pocket. That's what it was.

377
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:16,810
Thought l was two-timin' her,
runnin' around with another--

378
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:20,514
Of course.
She's just checkin' up on me.

379
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:26,759
l didn't tell her nothin', honest.

380
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:29,626
You'll let her go, won't you?

381
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:32,565
- You won't hurt her?
- Randy, Mike.

382
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:35,034
Take him to his apartment.
Stick with him until l phone you.

383
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:38,231
- l'm not leavin' Sherry here.
- You're leavin', all right.

384
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:42,073
- How are you goin'? Slidin' or walkin'?
- Come on. Let's go.

385
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:48,011
What are you gonna do now?

386
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:52,686
l don't think
l'll have to kill her...

387
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:54,915
just slap that face
into hamburger meat.

388
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:58,188
Why don't you take a walk
for an hour or so.

389
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,693
Yeah.

390
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:01,626
l'll be back in a couple of hours.

391
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:47,506
All right, sister. That's a mighty
pretty head you got on your shoulders.

392
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:50,443
You want to keep it there, or do you
want to carry it around in your hands?

393
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:53,140
Maybe we could compromise
and put it on your shoulder.

394
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:54,648
l think that'd be nice.

395
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:58,447
- What were you doing outside that door?
- Doing? l was listening, naturally.

396
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,283
Trying to, l should say.

397
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:02,323
You admit you were out there snooping?

398
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:05,827
Wasn't that naughty of me?
But l'm afraid l was.

399
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:07,919
l found an address
in George's pocket.

400
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:10,760
l thought he might be playin' around
with another woman, so l came here.

401
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:14,097
You'd care if he was playin'
another dame? That would bother you?

402
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:20,300
You don't understand me, Johnny.
You don't know me very well.

403
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,867
l know you like a book.
You're a no-good, nosy little tramp.

404
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:27,210
You'd sell out your own mother for
a piece of fudge, but you're smart...

405
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:29,512
smart enough to know when to sell
and when to sit tight.

406
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:31,518
- You know to sit tight in this case.
- l do.

407
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:33,554
You heard me. You like money.

408
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:37,114
You got a great big dollar sign there
where most women have a heart.

409
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:40,127
So play it smart-- stay in character,
and you'll have plenty of money.

410
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,095
George'll have it,
then he'll blow it all on you.

411
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:44,098
Probably buy himself
a five-cent cigar.

412
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,464
You don't know me very well, Johnny.

413
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:50,631
l wouldn't think of letting George
throw his money away on cigars.

414
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:53,300
lsn't there a big ""if""
in there somewhere?

415
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,138
There's a couple of them.

416
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,475
lf you're smart, if you keep your trap
shut and don't nose around anymore...

417
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,538
you'll have money,
you'll be loaded.

418
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:04,449
But if you don't, we'll forget
the whole thing. You won't have a penny.

419
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,952
l wouldn't like that.

420
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,785
Frail as l am,
l'd much prefer to be loaded.

421
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:12,190
l think we understand each other.
Now, beat it.

422
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:16,722
Those guys-- fine friends
they turned out to be...

423
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,232
slappin' me around,
callin' me dirty names.

424
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:22,293
l thought Randy'd cave
the side of my head in.

425
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,203
Poor George.
You're all right now, aren't you?

426
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:27,605
You shouldn't have come
over there tonight.

427
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:29,610
lt's a wonder
we both didn't get killed.

428
00:26:29,678 --> 00:26:31,873
l don't think there was
much danger of that.

429
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,541
lf they'd killed you,
there couldn't be a robbery.

430
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:37,449
lf they'd done anything to harm me
or offend you--

431
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,612
They have offended me.
They've offended me plenty.

432
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,986
Oh, don't be such an old bear.

433
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:44,491
They have,
and l'm not gonna forget it.

434
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,928
What else could they have done?
l thought they acted quite reasonably.

435
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:51,158
Well, anyway--

436
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:54,327
What-- What did Johnny do to you?

437
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,461
Do? l already told you.

438
00:26:56,538 --> 00:27:00,634
Just asked me some questions and made
sure it was all right for me to leave.

439
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,610
Sherry, did Johnny try anything--

440
00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:06,613
What a terrible thing
for you to ask.

441
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,774
l don't think
you'd better say any more.

442
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,342
Why did you come over there tonight?
lt wasn't for the reason you said.

443
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,253
lt was for the reason you said.
You said it yourself.

444
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:19,191
l was tryin' to make an alibi for you.
l was afraid those guys'd kill you.

445
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,252
You know l wouldn't look
at another woman.

446
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:23,695
There wouldn't be any women
chasin' after a guy like me.

447
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:25,528
Let's drop it, George.

448
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,296
You put words in my mouth,
and then you say they're not true.

449
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,634
l told you exactly what happened.

450
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,303
Oh, dear.

451
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,809
Everything's all right
with you and your pals now.

452
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:37,811
You're going to have lots of money--

453
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:40,814
- l've been thinkin' it over.
- l can hardly wait.

454
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:42,873
How soon will it be? What day?

455
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:45,818
lt ain't going to be.
l'm droppin' out.

456
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,379
You're dropping--
You don't mean it. You can't mean it.

457
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:51,220
l'm afraid, Sherry.

458
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:53,989
This business tonight
kind of opened my eyes.

459
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:58,055
lt made me realize the kind of guys
l was gettin' mixed up with.

460
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:02,263
-Before, all l thought of was the money.
-Just keep on thinking about that.

461
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:05,932
Think how disappointed l'd be
if you didn't get that money.

462
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,942
l'm afraid l'd feel like
you didn't really love me.

463
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,604
l don't see how l could feel
any other way.

464
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,049
Why should l have to do a thing
like that to prove that l love you?

465
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:19,280
What are you going to do?
l want to know right now.

466
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:21,618
All you've ever done
is talk about loving me.

467
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,716
That's all l've had
for the last five years, is talk.

468
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:27,956
Now that you have a chance
to do something--

469
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:30,964
All those things you promised--
Buy me things--

470
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:32,795
What are you gonna do?

471
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:36,065
There ain't a thing in the world
l wouldn't do for you.

472
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:39,072
Then you'll do this
for me, won't you?

473
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,738
- l guess so.
- lt'd be perfect.

474
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:49,580
You have no idea how perfect.
l won't have long to wait, will l?

475
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:52,484
lt will be within
the next few days, won't it?

476
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:55,921
- When will it be?
- You got your own way.

477
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:58,255
You wanted me to go ahead
with the deal, so l'm going.

478
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,294
Now, leave me alone, will you?

479
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:05,197
l'm sorry. We won't even talk
about it, if you don't want to.

480
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:07,599
You really love me, Sherry?

481
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,159
Of course.

482
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:11,102
You'll always love me?

483
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,935
Always and always.

484
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:24,247
Three days later at 10:15
on a Tuesday morning...

485
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,083
Johnny Clay began
the final preparations.

486
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,493
You want somebody to play with?

487
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,721
No, thanks.
l'm just looking for a friend.

488
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:38,622
You patzer. You missed the move.

489
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,224
Knight to knight's five.

490
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:43,533
Pawn takes knight, rook takes rook,
queen to rook for check.

491
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:46,039
Bother someone else.
You don't know what you're talkin'.

492
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:48,268
He couldn't do that.
You don't know what you're talkin'.

493
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:50,368
Shut up! Make a move.

494
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:52,640
He's right.
l could've won your rook.

495
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:55,740
- Move, patzer!
- Stop talkin', or l'll call Fisher.

496
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:57,842
l can't think with all this noise!

497
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,944
Good game, Maurice?

498
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,421
Johnny! My old friend.
How are you?

499
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,549
Good to see you.
Been a long time.

500
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:07,220
- How long have you been out?
- Not very long.

501
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:09,320
lt was very difficult, no?

502
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,092
Yeah.

503
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,997
Very difficult.

504
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,002
You have my sympathy.

505
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,665
You have not yet learned that in this
life you have to be like everyone else.

506
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,005
The perfect mediocrity.
No better, no worse.

507
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,942
lndividuality is a monster...

508
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:26,276
and it must be strangled
in its cradle...

509
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:28,782
to make our friends
feel comfortable.

510
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,342
You know, l often thought
that the gangster and the artist...

511
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,014
are the same
in the eyes of the masses.

512
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,024
They are admired
and hero-worshiped...

513
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:40,118
but there is always present
others...

514
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:43,187
to see them destroyed
at the peak of their growth.

515
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:47,030
Yeah, like the man said...

516
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:49,935
life is like a glass of tea, huh?

517
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,836
Oh, Johnny, my friend.

518
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:55,137
You never were very bright,
but l love you, anyway.

519
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:58,644
How's life been treating you, Maurice?

520
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:01,874
About the same as always.

521
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,714
When l need some money,
l go out and wrestle.

522
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:07,914
But mostly l'm up here
wasting my time playing chess.

523
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:09,581
But, you know...

524
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:13,753
l wouldn't know what to do with myself
if l didn't have this place to come to.

525
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:16,592
Maurice, could you use $2,500?

526
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:20,498
lt has a pleasant ring to the ear,
quite musical.

527
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:22,160
What is it for?

528
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:25,798
For takin' care of a half a dozen
private dicks, racetrack cops.

529
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:27,967
l want you to start a fight
with the bartender at the track.

530
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:31,012
The cops'll try to break it up.
You'll keep 'em busy as long as you can.

531
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,207
Make 'em drag you outta the place.
No gunplay, strictly a muscle job.

532
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,978
Would it be out of order
for me to ask for what it is...

533
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:40,579
that you are willing to pay such a price
to see me demonstrate my talents?

534
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:45,217
l would imagine it is for more than
just your own personal entertainment.

535
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:49,195
$2,500 is a lot of dough.
Part of it's for not askin' questions.

536
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:51,323
That sounds not unreasonable.

537
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,836
Still, l will probably go to jail,
and jails l've found unpleasant.

538
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:59,135
The food is very bad,
company's poor...

539
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,697
beds are too small--

540
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:04,142
lt'll only be a disorderly conduct
charge. Maybe 60 days, nothing worse.

541
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:08,046
lf a man has money to spread around in
the right places, he can be comfortable.

542
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:10,050
l do not quite understand.

543
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:14,214
For what you want me to do,
you could get any hoodlum for $100.

544
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,780
l don't want any hoodlum.
l want a guy like you--

545
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:18,655
someone who's
absolutely dependable...

546
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:21,923
who knows he's bein' well-paid
to take a risk and won't squawk.

547
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:26,057
l was thinking if perhaps you cannot
work out some other arrangement.

548
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,001
2,500 l like very much.

549
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,504
But suppose l were willing
to forego part of it...

550
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:35,168
and take a share
in your enterprise instead.

551
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,573
- lt's not mine to share up.
- Very well.

552
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:42,275
Since there will be details
to work out--

553
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,784
Yeah. l'll buy you a cup of coffee.

554
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:54,758
- lt's beautiful, isn't it?
- lt's exactly what l wanted.

555
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:58,196
You could take care of a whole roomful
of people with that gun.

556
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:01,235
May not kill 'em all, but they wouldn't
be good for anything afterwards.

557
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:05,739
l knew you'd take care of it, Nikki.
How long have you had this place?

558
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,297
Almost a year.

559
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,071
lt's picturesque enough,
but there can't be much profit in it.

560
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:13,478
There isn't, but then there isn't
much trouble neither.

561
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:15,311
What are you thinking about?

562
00:33:15,383 --> 00:33:18,375
A job, your kind of a job--
a job with a rifle.

563
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:21,217
- What kind of money, pops?
- Five thousand.

564
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:24,156
- Who do l have to kill?
- A horse.

565
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:26,193
- A horse?
- A four-legged horse.

566
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:29,321
- For that l get 5,000?
- For that and--

567
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,388
l figured there'd be a gimmick.

568
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:34,060
The gimmick isn't
as tough as you may think.

569
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:37,332
You shoot the horse, and if anything
goes wrong, you don't squawk.

570
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:41,899
- All l got to do is bump off a horse?
- lt's a special kind of a horse.

571
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,672
For certain reasons, including your own
protection in case anything happens...

572
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:47,442
l'm not gonna give you the whole story,
just your part of it.

573
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:50,211
Next Saturday,
the $100,000 handicap is bein' run.

574
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:53,686
ln the seventh race, the big race of
the season, a certain horse is runnin'.

575
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:56,019
He's one of the best three-year-olds
to come along in the last ten years.

576
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,024
He'a big money winner,
and he won't pay even money...

577
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:00,185
because half the people there
are going to be down on him.

578
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:04,163
There's a parking lot less than 300 feet
from the northwest corner of the track.

579
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:06,496
From a car parked
in the southeast corner of that lot...

580
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:11,005
you get a perfect view of the horses
as they start into the stretch.

581
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,906
A man in a car parked in that spot
using a rifle with a telescopic sight...

582
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:17,638
should be able to bring down
any horse with a single shot.

583
00:34:17,712 --> 00:34:20,010
A man with your eye would hardly need
a telescopic sight.

584
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,641
That horse is worth
a quarter million bucks.

585
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:25,652
- The crowd would go nuts.
- Let 'em go nuts.

586
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,656
You can do it easy, and you shouldn't
have too much trouble getting away.

587
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:32,625
Red Lightning will undoubtedly
be leadin' in the stretch.

588
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:35,128
He goes down, a couple of other horses
pile up on top of him.

589
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:37,892
There'll be plenty of confusion,
l'll guarantee that.

590
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:40,901
There's one more thing.
Suppose you do get picked up.

591
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:43,665
What've you done? You shot a horse.
lt isn't first-degree murder.

592
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:47,765
lt isn't even murder. The best
they could get you on would be...

593
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:50,811
inciting a riot
or shooting horses out of season.

594
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,109
The way you put it,
you make it sound real simple.

595
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:56,412
Five thousand bucks
for rubbin' out a horse.

596
00:34:57,885 --> 00:35:01,685
- Okay. How do l get it?
- 2,500 today, 2,500 after the race.

597
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:05,419
Okay. Crazy. Now tell me something.
What's your angle, John?

598
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:09,589
They'll probably call the race off,
and they won't pay off any of the bets.

599
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:12,428
Maybe, but what my angle is
is my business.

600
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,435
Five thousand bucks is a lot,
and that's what l'm payin' it for--

601
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:17,437
so nobody has to know my business.

602
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:20,531
All right. You'll have no trouble
with me. l'm with you.

603
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,324
- l'm lookin' for Joe Piano.
- Who's lookin' for Joe?

604
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:39,985
- Patsy sent me.
- Patsy who?

605
00:35:40,061 --> 00:35:42,052
- Patsy Gennelli.
- Where did you see Patsy?

606
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,064
Alcatraz. We roomed together.
My name--

607
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:47,067
Don't tell me who you are.
What can l do for you?

608
00:35:47,135 --> 00:35:49,330
l want a place to stay
for about a week.

609
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:52,669
l don't want it cleaned, and l don't
want anybody else in it except myself.

610
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,731
l think l can accommodate you.

611
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:56,834
- So how's the boy?
- He's fine.

612
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,345
He's doin' it on his ear.
He's the best pitcher they got.

613
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:01,439
He told me to tell you
not to worry about him.

614
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:04,110
He's doing the book.
l won plenty.

615
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:07,780
- He's tough. Maybe he'll get a break.
- l know. Let's hope.

616
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:13,187
Here you are. You don't have
to worry about leaving anything here.

617
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:16,526
lt'll be safe. l'm always here.
There'll be no maid service.

618
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:19,862
- Want to leave anything in there?
- Just this, and another bag next week.

619
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,868
Don't worry.
Nobody will disturb them.

620
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:25,235
- What'll it be?
- No charge. You said Patsy sent you.

621
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:28,605
Sure, he sent me. He's a friend,
and l'd feel better if l paid.

622
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:30,940
lt's a business arrangement.
l can afford it.

623
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:33,776
Then it'll be ten dollars a week.

624
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:36,544
l'll send the money
and the butts to the boy.

625
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:39,552
Thank you very much.
Have a nice time.

626
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,285
Four days later at 7:30 a.m....

627
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,520
Sherry Peatty was wide awake.

628
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:36,038
- Did l wake you up? l'm sorry.
- lt's all right.

629
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,135
l just couldn't sleep somehow.

630
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:40,544
Can l get you anything?
Would you like more coffee?

631
00:37:40,615 --> 00:37:43,880
No, l guess not.
Nice of you to offer, though.

632
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:46,977
l'm just nervous and restless.
l'll be all right.

633
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:49,989
- Go on back to bed.
- No, l won't.

634
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:52,321
Even if l don't get up to get
my husband's breakfast...

635
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:55,226
the least l can do is sit with him
while he has his coffee.

636
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:57,662
Gosh, you sure you feel all right--

637
00:37:57,732 --> 00:38:00,326
l'm sorry. l didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

638
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,926
l deserved it.

639
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:06,940
l know l've been irritable and moody
and l haven't acted like l should.

640
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,476
lt's just, l can't stand
living like this--

641
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:11,478
a crummy apartment
and a hamburger for dinner.

642
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:15,141
- You haven't been so bad, baby.
- Yes, l have.

643
00:38:15,216 --> 00:38:17,377
But things are gonna be different.

644
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:22,389
We'll have so many nice things.
l'll stop thinking about myself so much.

645
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:24,891
Your problems will be my problems.

646
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,621
Whenever you're worried about something,
like now, for instance--

647
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:31,131
-ls it the robbery you're worried about?
-l guess it is a little.

648
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,134
l have no reason to.
l know it's going to be all right.

649
00:38:34,202 --> 00:38:37,638
Naturally you'd be a little upset
at a time like this.

650
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:40,501
lt's today, isn't it?

651
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:44,903
What makes you think that? Just
because l could sleep, it doesn't mean--

652
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:47,914
l know my Georgie.
He can't fool me.

653
00:38:47,982 --> 00:38:50,576
l'm right, aren't l?
Today is the day we get that money.

654
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:52,710
No, you ain't. lt isn't today.

655
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:54,948
lf you don't stop pestering me...

656
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:58,116
tryin' to find out something,
there ain't gonna be no money.

657
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:01,559
- How can you--
- l mean it. l'm gettin' fed up.

658
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:06,328
You heard Johnny. Stop butting in.
He'd call this whole thing off.

659
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,665
He told me something else, too,
which l neglected to tell you--

660
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:13,400
that if l did butt in,
that he'd break my neck.

661
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:17,137
He wanted to make you understand
that he means business.

662
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,614
All l've gotta say is
you've certainly changed your tune...

663
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:24,378
since he and his friends
slapped you around.

664
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:26,386
l was pretty sore about that.

665
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:29,048
What could they do? You said yourself
they acted pretty reasonable.

666
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:32,217
- We had no reason to hold a grudge.
- l'm not gonna argue with you.

667
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:35,194
lf you let people beat you up and then
take their side against your own wife--

668
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:38,755
But you did. l wanted to quit.
You wouldn't let me.

669
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,063
You said l had no reason to.

670
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:45,469
Anyway, Johnny didn't lay a hand on me.
None of the guys did, but Randy.

671
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,202
l was gonna tell you somethin'
about your friend Johnny...

672
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:50,437
but since you feel about him
like you do--

673
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:52,445
Take his word against mine.

674
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:56,449
What about him?
What were you gonna tell me?

675
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:58,815
Let's stop the conversation
right there.

676
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:01,548
What were you gonna tell me?

677
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:05,718
l don't think l can tell you
when you feel like you do about him...

678
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:09,285
not havin' any faith in me
in keepin' secrets.

679
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,560
We won't have any secrets.
What happened?

680
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:16,899
l tried to tell you about this
the other night, but...

681
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,668
you were so upset and anytime l tried
to say anything, you cut me off.

682
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:23,335
What are you tryin' to tell me?

683
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:28,276
l tried to stop him.
l pleaded and l struggled.

684
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:33,281
lt doesn't matter, does it?

685
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:36,619
The only thing that matters
is how l feel about you.

686
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,560
lt is today, isn't it?

687
00:40:44,432 --> 00:40:46,366
Earlier that morning at 5:00 a.m....

688
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,800
Red Lightning was fed
only a half portion of feed...

689
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:51,702
in preparation for the seventh race
that afternoon...

690
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:54,366
the $100,000 Landsdowne Stakes.

691
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:00,212
At 7:00 that morning,
Johnny Clay began what might be...

692
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:02,306
the last day of his life.

693
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:10,823
- What time is it?
- lt's early yet. lt's only 7:00.

694
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:13,155
You better go back to sleep
after l leave.

695
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:17,493
l just wanted to say good-bye,
till tonight, that is.

696
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,499
Everything's all set.
Should go perfectly.

697
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:22,502
But if it doesn't,
don't talk about this with anyone.

698
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,267
You'll be in the clear except for your
books. l don't think they'll be rough--

699
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:30,538
l'm not worried about that.
l'm not worried about anything.

700
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:33,102
l just wish
l could do more to help.

701
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,638
You've done your part.
l only hope we can do ours as well.

702
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:39,652
We'll probably never see
each other again...

703
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,518
after we split the money
and break up tonight.

704
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,785
ln my book, you'll always be
a stand-up guy.

705
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:51,360
l don't know how to say this,
and l don't know if l have the right...

706
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:55,163
but l've always thought
maybe you're like my own kid.

707
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,170
You can say anything you want.

708
00:41:57,238 --> 00:42:01,038
You've had a lot of rough breaks
and maybe you've made a few mistakes...

709
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:02,973
but after today...

710
00:42:03,044 --> 00:42:05,979
the good Lord willing,
you'll be a new man...

711
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:08,140
a rich man.

712
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:10,740
That can make a lot of difference.

713
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:14,811
You've got a lot of life ahead of you,
a lot of people to meet...

714
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:17,653
people of quality and substance.

715
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:19,522
What are you gettin' at?

716
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:22,528
Wouldn't it be great if we could
just go away, the two of us...

717
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:25,997
and let the old world
take a couple of turns and...

718
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:29,503
have a chance
to take stock of things?

719
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,834
lt can be pretty serious
and terrible...

720
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:34,841
particularly if it's not
the right person.

721
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:36,672
Getting married, l mean.

722
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:40,338
You better go back to sleep.

723
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:45,010
The seventh race starts about 4:30,
if you wanna catch it on the radio.

724
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:47,077
l'll be back here about 7:00.

725
00:42:50,424 --> 00:42:53,587
Keep away from the track.
Go to a movie or something.

726
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:55,356
See you later.

727
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:02,801
lt was exactly 7:00 a.m.
when he got to the airport.

728
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,303
The weight is okay, Mr. Preston.
ls that all the baggage?

729
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,867
l'll have one more with me tonight.
l can keep that in the cabin, can't l?

730
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:14,813
Yes, but check in here at the counter
prior to flight time.

731
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:17,476
Flight 465 leaves at 9:00 p.m. tonight.

732
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:20,645
- Thank you.
- Thank you for flying American, sir.

733
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:27,652
Stopping first at a florist,
he arrived at the motel at 8:15.

734
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,491
He was on schedule.

735
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:32,759
- Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning, Joe.

736
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:36,166
This afternoon a friend of mine is
stopping by and leaving a bundle for me.

737
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:37,829
- He's a cop.
- A cop?

738
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:39,930
He drives a prowl car.

739
00:43:40,007 --> 00:43:43,272
- A funny kind of friend you have.
- He's a funny kind of a cop.

740
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,778
Let him in.
He'll leave this bundle about 6:30.

741
00:43:45,846 --> 00:43:48,679
l'll pick it up right after that,
and that's the last you'll see of me.

742
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:51,513
- Would you come in for a drink?
- l'd like to, but l got a lot to do.

743
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:55,021
- lf l did, everything'd be fouled up.
- l understand. l'll see you tonight.

744
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:57,023
So long. Take care of yourself.

745
00:44:41,902 --> 00:44:44,837
He reached the bus station
at 8:45.

746
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:15,561
lt was 9:20 when he arrived
at Mike's apartment.

747
00:45:15,636 --> 00:45:19,538
So far, everything had gone off
according to plan.

748
00:45:27,014 --> 00:45:29,448
Mike O'Reilly was ready at 11:15.

749
00:45:29,516 --> 00:45:31,211
What goes on here?

750
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,776
This is no way
to get your strength back.

751
00:45:33,854 --> 00:45:37,415
lt's very good,
but l guess l'm just not hungry.

752
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:39,516
- l couldn't eat another bite.
- Another?

753
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:41,618
You haven't eaten anything yet.

754
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:45,461
l'll take something after a while,
after l've had my medicine.

755
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:48,865
- l'll have more appetite then.
- That's a promise. No tricks now.

756
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:52,872
lt's a promise. You better go along,
or you'll be late for work.

757
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,500
Yeah, l guess l will.

758
00:45:55,576 --> 00:45:58,568
Ruthie, things are gonna get
much better for us.

759
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:01,274
l know. l know, dear.

760
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:04,784
l know l've made a lot of promises
in the past, but...

761
00:46:04,852 --> 00:46:06,786
this time it's not just talk.

762
00:46:06,854 --> 00:46:08,788
We're gonna be rich, and soon.

763
00:46:08,856 --> 00:46:11,723
You're gonna have a fine house
and doctors that'll make you well again.

764
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:15,387
Of course, dear.
You'd better go along or you'll be late.

765
00:46:15,462 --> 00:46:16,895
Yeah.

766
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,763
- Mike?
- Yes?

767
00:46:21,835 --> 00:46:24,497
On your way home tonight,
would you bring me some magazines?

768
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:26,061
Of course.

769
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,634
But l'm going to be a little late,
probably about 10:00.

770
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:33,271
Some of the fellows and me
are having a little get-together.

771
00:46:33,347 --> 00:46:34,780
l understand.

772
00:46:34,848 --> 00:46:36,941
Don't you drink too much beer.

773
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:39,451
Remember how it always
leaves you the next day.

774
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,183
Don't worry about that.
l won't be doing any drinking tonight.

775
00:46:45,526 --> 00:46:49,189
l called Mother. She'll be over
this afternoon to fix your dinner.

776
00:46:49,263 --> 00:46:52,858
Thank you, dear. Good-bye.

777
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,802
Don't forget to eat your breakfast.

778
00:47:18,692 --> 00:47:21,286
He reached the bus station at 11:29.

779
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:55,888
At 12:10, as it was his custom,
he arrived at the track.

780
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:11,940
What have we got here?
Who's the girlfriend?

781
00:48:12,012 --> 00:48:14,606
That's how you spend your money--
on dames.

782
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:17,445
An old man like you
that ought to know better.

783
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:20,681
l ain't like you guys.
These posies are for my wife.

784
00:48:20,754 --> 00:48:25,054
Besides, where do you guys get off
calling me an old man?

785
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,218
Why don't you buy your flowers
after work?

786
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:29,228
They'll wilt before you get home.

787
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:33,460
lt can't be helped. After work,
the shops will all be closed.

788
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:35,798
Why don't you put them in some water?

789
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:38,963
The clubhouse steward
would put 'em in the refrigerator.

790
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,303
Perhaps l should, but--

791
00:48:42,443 --> 00:48:44,035
lt's getting late now--

792
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:46,944
- Why don't l do it for you?
- No!

793
00:48:47,014 --> 00:48:49,608
l was just tryin'
to do you a favor.

794
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:53,141
The flowers are going in my locker.
Then l'll know where they are.

795
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,812
Okay. Suit yourself.

796
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:57,550
l'm sorry, Bill.
l appreciate your offer.

797
00:48:57,624 --> 00:48:59,717
After work, you know how it is.

798
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:02,762
Everybody'll be in a hurry
to get away and--

799
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:45,763
...third and Trumpet King.

800
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,273
lt is My Baby leading by a length.

801
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:51,402
Concentrator is second
by three-quarters of a length.

802
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:54,538
Second Ending, moving fast
on the outside, is third.

803
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:56,480
And Trumpet King.

804
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,042
lt is My Baby, Concentrator
and Second Ending.

805
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,487
lt is Second Ending,
Concentrator and Trumpet King.

806
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:06,321
lt is Second Ending and Concentrator
down to the wire.

807
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:09,157
lt's Second Ending the winner
by a half a length.

808
00:50:09,229 --> 00:50:11,163
Concentrator's second by two...

809
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:13,426
Trumpet King, third,
and My Baby.

810
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:19,095
The result of the first race
now appears on the board.

811
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:21,334
Be sure to hold all tickets...

812
00:50:21,408 --> 00:50:24,571
until the result of the race
is declared official.

813
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:28,479
After the first race,
Mike was very busy.

814
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:41,119
Give me a double bourbon, please.

815
00:50:42,663 --> 00:50:45,530
Don't you think
you've had enough, pal?

816
00:50:49,469 --> 00:50:50,902
Your attention, please.

817
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:55,340
The horses are now on the track
for the second race at six furlongs.

818
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:58,139
At exactly 3:32
that same afternoon...

819
00:50:58,212 --> 00:51:01,648
officer Randy Kennon set in motion
his phase of the operation.

820
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:07,017
Hello, Fred.
This is Randy.

821
00:51:07,087 --> 00:51:10,716
Check the dispatcher's office and see if
they've been gettin' me loud and clear.

822
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:14,318
l think my set's
a little on the blink. Sure.

823
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:22,329
What? He says it's okay?

824
00:51:22,402 --> 00:51:24,962
That's funny.
lt keeps goin' dead.

825
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:28,235
l don't think it's one of the tubes.
l'll keep foolin' around with it.

826
00:51:28,308 --> 00:51:32,904
Give my regards to your missus.
When's the big day supposed to be?

827
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,541
Well, don't worry about it.
The sixth one is always the hardest.

828
00:51:47,427 --> 00:51:49,019
Officer!

829
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,564
Thank heaven! Hurry! Come quick!
They're killing each other!

830
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:58,571
l always knew they--

831
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:05,374
He had timed the trip to the track
on half a dozen different occasions...

832
00:52:05,445 --> 00:52:08,812
and he knew at just what point
he should be at precisely what time.

833
00:52:08,882 --> 00:52:11,817
He knew the entire success of the plan
depended on his accuracy...

834
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:14,513
in arriving at the track
at exactly the correct moment.

835
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:18,183
A minute or two early was allowable,
but ten seconds late would be fatal.

836
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:22,291
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

837
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:25,923
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

838
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:30,732
The $100,000 Added
Landsdowne Stakes at one mile.

839
00:52:56,797 --> 00:52:59,231
And they're off and running!

840
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:02,427
At the start it is Red Lightning
breaking on top.

841
00:53:02,502 --> 00:53:06,131
Early Streak is second. l'm Hoping
is third. White Fire is fourth.

842
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:10,108
Earlier that afternoon, at 2:30,
Maurice was at the chess club.

843
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:12,441
He was to be at the track
in position at 4:00...

844
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:14,946
just before the start
of the seventh race.

845
00:53:18,752 --> 00:53:22,518
Fisher, l am supposed to be
back here tonight about 6:30.

846
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:25,023
lf l'm not, l'd like you
to do something for me.

847
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:26,491
Sure. What is it?

848
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,688
l'd like you to call this number
and ask for Mr. Stillman...

849
00:53:29,763 --> 00:53:32,857
and tell him
Maurice requires his services.

850
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:35,663
Sounds pretty mysterious.
What's it all about?

851
00:53:35,736 --> 00:53:40,105
There are some things, my dear Fisher,
which do not bear much looking into.

852
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,437
You have undoubtedly heard
of the Siberian goatherd...

853
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:45,000
who tried to discover
the true nature of the sun.

854
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:48,980
He stared up at the heavenly body
until it made him blind.

855
00:53:49,049 --> 00:53:53,349
There are many things of this sort,
including love and death.

856
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,355
Please remember to make that call
if l'm not back at 6:30.

857
00:53:58,091 --> 00:54:00,355
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

858
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:03,726
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

859
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:07,995
The $100,000 Added
Landsdowne Stakes at one mile.

860
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:12,068
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

861
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,836
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

862
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:20,243
The $100,000 Added
Landsdowne Stakes at one mile.

863
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:41,757
- Yes, sir?
- Bottle of beer.

864
00:54:45,872 --> 00:54:49,364
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

865
00:54:58,018 --> 00:55:00,111
The horses are at the gate.

866
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:20,028
Hey! Can l have some service,
you stupid-looking lrish pig!

867
00:55:20,106 --> 00:55:21,368
What's the matter--

868
00:56:48,295 --> 00:56:50,229
Come on, break it up!

869
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:57,703
lt was exactly 4:23
when they dragged Maurice out.

870
00:56:57,771 --> 00:57:00,968
At 11:40 that morning,
Nikki left his farm.

871
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:16,985
He arrived at the track at 12:30.

872
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:27,724
- Hi, there.
- Use the other parking lot.

873
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:30,668
- l don't like to trouble you.
- You're not troubling me.

874
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:33,604
There's no parking here,
and that's that.

875
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:36,574
Look, Mac, l'm a paraplegic...

876
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:39,544
and l want to get in this lot
to watch the races from my car.

877
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:41,547
That ain't my problem, mister.

878
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:45,676
My leg's bum too,
but nobody's feeling sorry for me.

879
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:48,687
l know what you mean, buddy.

880
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:51,849
- Get that in the war?
- Battle of the Bulge.

881
00:57:51,925 --> 00:57:56,123
Look, l know this is a lot of
extra trouble for you. l want you to--

882
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:59,757
- No. Skip it.
- l want you to take it.

883
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,461
Now go on, keep it.

884
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:04,931
lt's all right.

885
00:58:05,005 --> 00:58:08,236
- Thanks, mister. l'm sorry--
- Forget it.

886
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:12,802
Will you take down that fence? l'd like
to settle down before the first race.

887
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:15,279
- Okay?
- Sure, mister.

888
00:58:42,642 --> 00:58:46,169
Your attention, please. The horses are
now on the track for the second race...

889
00:58:46,246 --> 00:58:48,180
at six furlongs.

890
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:54,849
l had this layin' around, mister.
l thought you might like to have it.

891
00:58:54,921 --> 00:58:56,855
Thanks.
That's very kind of you.

892
00:58:56,923 --> 00:58:59,721
No trouble at all.
lf you need anything else, just call.

893
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:03,354
l doubt if l'll need anything.
l'm getting along just fine.

894
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,920
But thanks anyway.

895
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:07,466
Who you bettin' on?
Anything look good to you?

896
00:59:07,534 --> 00:59:09,502
- Red Lightning.
- Huh?

897
00:59:09,569 --> 00:59:12,970
- Red Lightning in the seventh.
- So you're bettin' on him, huh?

898
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:15,507
Yeah. l got a little bet
down on him.

899
00:59:15,575 --> 00:59:18,476
l guess l'd better be
gettin' back to work.

900
00:59:18,545 --> 00:59:21,810
- Thanks for bringin' me the program.
- No trouble at all.

901
00:59:21,881 --> 00:59:24,475
You sure there's nothing else
l can do for you?

902
00:59:24,551 --> 00:59:28,419
Nothing at all. lf l think of anything,
l can give you a yell.

903
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:53,608
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

904
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,309
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

905
00:59:57,383 --> 01:00:01,581
The $100,000 Added
Landsdowne Stakes at one mile.

906
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:10,319
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

907
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:27,935
- Sure is a nice day, ain't it?
- Yeah.

908
01:00:28,014 --> 01:00:32,280
Didn't think it would be when l first
got up today, but it turned out fine.

909
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:34,445
Kind of funny
when you stop to look at it.

910
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:37,752
Weather's almost the same
as it always is this time of year, but--

911
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:41,586
l sure appreciate
the way you treat me, mister.

912
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:45,222
lt's not so much the money. Of course
l appreciate that too, but it's more--

913
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:47,789
- Forget it.
- No, sir.

914
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:50,495
l don't reckon
l'll ever forget it.

915
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,131
l brought you some luck, mister.
l figured you might need it.

916
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:56,801
Look. Keep your junk
and leave me alone, will you?

917
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:59,970
- Somethin' wrong?
- You're wrong, nigger!

918
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:03,281
Be a nice guy
and go on about your business.

919
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:06,749
Sure, boss.

920
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,345
Sorry to have bothered you.

921
01:01:09,422 --> 01:01:11,356
My mistake.

922
01:01:22,902 --> 01:01:25,393
And they're off and running!

923
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:27,905
At the start it is
Red Lightning breaking on top.

924
01:01:27,974 --> 01:01:29,908

925
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:32,342
White Fire is fourth.

926
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:36,280
Little Arnie is next.
Seymour's Darling and Best Seller.

927
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:39,910
Moving down the backstretch, it's
Red Lightning by a length and a quarter.

928
01:01:39,986 --> 01:01:42,955
l'm Hoping is second
by three-quarters of a length.

929
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:45,718
Little Arnie is third
by a length and a quarter...

930
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:47,817
and Seymour's Darling.

931
01:01:47,894 --> 01:01:49,486
Passing the half-mile post...

932
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:51,655

by a length and a quarter.

933

Seymour's Darling is third...

935
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:59,194
and little Arnie
moving fast to the outside.

936
01:01:59,272 --> 01:02:02,002
lnto the far turn
it is Red Lightning...

937
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:04,441

a length and a quarter.

01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:07,536
Little Arnie is second by half a length.
l'm Hoping is third.

939
01:02:07,614 --> 01:02:11,516
And a horse is down!
lt is Red Lightning.

940
01:02:11,584 --> 01:02:14,678
At the head of the stretch,
it is l'm Hoping...

941

taking the lead
by half a length.

942
01:02:20,026 --> 01:02:22,290
Stop! Stop or l'll shoot!

943
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:31,967
Down to the wire, it is Little Arnie
going steadily, holding it and winning.

944
01:02:32,038 --> 01:02:34,506
Nikki was dead at 4:24.

945
01:02:34,574 --> 01:02:38,340
At 2:15 that afternoon,
Johnny Clay was still in the city.

946
01:02:38,411 --> 01:02:41,005
He knew exactly how long it would
take him to drive to the track...

947
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,275
park his car
and walk to the grandstand.

948
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:46,716
He planned to arrive just before
the start of the seventh race.

949
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:51,957
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

950
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:55,188

The horses are approaching
the starting gate...

953
01:04:13,473 --> 01:04:15,407
for the seventh race.

954
01:04:20,346 --> 01:04:24,112
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking lrish pig!

955
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:32,057
Money room. Claude here.

956
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:34,252
Yes, sir, right away.

957
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:36,591
There's a riot downstairs.
Come on.

958
01:05:06,526 --> 01:05:08,756

Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Be sure to hold all tickets.

986
01:06:35,314 --> 01:06:39,045
The stewards are conducting an inquiry
into the running of the seventh race...

987
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:41,382
and they'll view
the motion picture.

988
01:06:58,404 --> 01:06:59,837
Get your hands up!

989
01:06:59,906 --> 01:07:03,171
One move out of any one of you
and l'm gonna start firing.

990
01:07:03,242 --> 01:07:07,178
You! Fill that bag up
just as fast as you know how.

991
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:12,579
You! Take that gun
out of the holster.

992
01:07:12,652 --> 01:07:15,018
Be awful careful how you do it.

993
01:07:21,561 --> 01:07:22,994
Now drop it.

994
01:07:23,796 --> 01:07:25,730
Kick it over here.

995
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,933
Turn toward the wall.

996
01:07:39,779 --> 01:07:42,213
All right,
now the money in the safe.

997
01:07:45,818 --> 01:07:48,218
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

998
01:07:48,287 --> 01:07:50,881
We have received
no exact information...

999
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:54,256
concerning the spill of Red Lightning
in the seventh race.

1000
01:07:54,327 --> 01:07:57,785
However, jockey Danny Freed
appears to be unhurt.

1001
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:02,567
- Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
- Fill it up!

1002
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:04,899
We have received
no exact information...

1003
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:07,963
concerning the spill of Red Lightning
in the seventh race.

1004
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,532
However, jockey Danny Freed
appears to be unhurt.

1005
01:08:38,237 --> 01:08:41,900
All right, that's enough. Now put
the bag in the middle of the floor.

1006
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,903
Get back over there.

1007
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:49,709
Now, l'm gonna open this door.

1008
01:08:49,782 --> 01:08:52,842
Go through it and go into
the locker room, and close the door.

1009
01:08:52,918 --> 01:08:56,354
l'm gonna start firing through that door
15 seconds after you close the door.

1010
01:08:58,324 --> 01:08:59,985
Let's go.

1011
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,934
Close it!

1012
01:09:55,548 --> 01:09:57,982
- Just a minute.
- What are you doing?

1013
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:20,666
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a special news bulletin.

1014
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:24,301
ln one of the most daring and carefully
executed holdups in criminal history...

1015
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:28,074
a lone bandit wearing a rubber mask
today took an estimated $2 million...

1016
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:32,015
stuffed into a large duffel bag from the
offices of the Landsdowne Racetrack.

1017
01:10:32,084 --> 01:10:34,416
lt occurred during
the running of the seventh race...

1018
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:37,547
and was apparently timed to coincide
with the shooting of Red Lightning...

1019
01:10:37,623 --> 01:10:42,185
just as the horse, valued at $250,000,
was leading the pack at the far turn.

1020
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,786
The jockey, Danny Freed,
escaped with minor injuries.

1021
01:10:44,864 --> 01:10:48,664
A man identified as Nikki Arane, who
allegedly shot the prize thoroughbred...

1022
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:50,998
was himself fatally wounded
by track police...

1023
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,664
as he attempted to shoot his way
out of the track parking lot.

1024
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:57,231
At this time, the most baffling mystery
that still plagues the authorities...

1025
01:10:57,309 --> 01:11:00,506
is just how the bandit managed to
successfully get away from the track...

1026
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:02,945
with the bulky duffel bag
containing the money.

1027
01:11:03,015 --> 01:11:05,711
A painstaking search of
the track grounds is being conducted...

1028
01:11:05,785 --> 01:11:08,413
on the theory that the money
may still be hidden there.

1029
01:11:08,487 --> 01:11:12,253
And now we take you back
to our regularly scheduled program.

1030
01:11:12,324 --> 01:11:14,383
No one saw the duffel bag
come out of the window.

1031
01:11:18,998 --> 01:11:21,728
That part of it worked okay.

1032
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:24,565
Landed right at my feet.

1033
01:11:24,637 --> 01:11:28,300
l reported my radio out of order
before l went out to the track.

1034
01:11:28,374 --> 01:11:31,673
But the captain ain't buyin' it. He
thinks l was holed up somewhere drunk.

1035
01:11:31,744 --> 01:11:35,510
And if the captain's convinced, there
ain't nobody that can un-convince him.

1036
01:11:36,749 --> 01:11:41,584
Besides, no one's gonna think anything
of seein' a cop at the racetrack.

1037
01:11:41,654 --> 01:11:45,988
l mean, they won't get any funny ideas
about it and tie it in with the robbery.

1038
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,588
Anyway, if they do,
it won't cut any ice.

1039
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:54,656
Captain knows l was drunk,
and he ain't a man you can argue with.

1040
01:11:54,733 --> 01:11:57,896
So l guess l'll just have to
break down and admit it...

1041
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,904
and take my punishment.

1042
01:11:59,972 --> 01:12:04,306
Yeah. That would be terrible,
wouldn't it, Randy? A 30-day suspension.

1043
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:06,539
lt's 7:15.

1044
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:09,240
Don't worry. He'll get here.

1045
01:12:09,315 --> 01:12:12,807
He had to pick up the dough
at the motel where l dropped it.

1046
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:17,049
There was a funny little guy name of Joe
Piano there. Runs the place, l guess.

1047
01:12:17,122 --> 01:12:19,317
Hope Johnny knows
how to pick his friends.

1048
01:12:19,391 --> 01:12:21,325
l need another drink.

1049
01:12:23,963 --> 01:12:25,658
Why ain't he here?

1050
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:29,565
Everything else runs on a timetable
till it comes to payin' us our shares.

1051
01:12:29,635 --> 01:12:32,627
Then the timetable breaks down.

1052
01:12:32,705 --> 01:12:35,503
He was supposed
to be here at 7:00.

1053
01:12:39,144 --> 01:12:41,806
- l think l hear the elevator.
- That'll be Johnny.

1054
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,354
- Everybody up.
- What is this?

1055
01:12:50,422 --> 01:12:52,947
lt'll be a massacre
if you don't keep those mitts up.

1056
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:54,959
Where's Johnny?
What time's he due?

1057
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:59,388
l've been sittin' out in that car
since 4:00 listenin' to that radio.

1058
01:12:59,465 --> 01:13:03,128
l heard some pretty interesting things.
Grandpa, what time's Johnny comin'?

1059
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:06,170
Somebody give you
a bum steer, buddy.

1060
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:08,399
Look around.

1061
01:13:08,474 --> 01:13:12,911
Can't believe you were tipped, huh?
Well, if l had a certain lady here--

1062
01:13:12,978 --> 01:13:15,208
- Where's the jerk? Where's George?
- Right here!

1063
01:13:46,879 --> 01:13:50,975
Forty minutes before, at 6:25,
Johnny reached the motel.

1064
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:54,850
Due to heavy traffic around the track,
he was 15 minutes behind schedule.

1065
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:00,825
Yeah? Who is it?

1066
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:05,091
Oh, it's just a mistake.
l'm sorry.

1067
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:33,715
Johnny arrived at the meeting place
at 7:29, still 15 minutes late.

1068
01:14:43,035 --> 01:14:45,299
lt had been prearranged
and agreed to by all...

1069
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:47,771
that in the event of
an emergency before the split...

1070
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,866
the money was to be saved by whoever
had possession of it at that time...

1071
01:14:50,943 --> 01:14:53,537
without any consideration
of the fate of the others...

1072
01:14:53,612 --> 01:14:56,410
the money to be divided
in safety at a later date.

1073
01:14:56,482 --> 01:15:00,350
After what he'd seen, not knowing the
cause or circumstances of the others...

1074
01:15:00,419 --> 01:15:03,616
Johnny had no choice
but to save himself and the money.

1075
01:15:11,764 --> 01:15:14,790
Ten minutes later, he bought
the largest suitcase he could find.

1076
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:30,434
l'm back here, Val darling.

1077
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:35,079
How'd it go, dear?

1078
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:40,483
- Watch out.
- What happened?

1079
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,915
Sherry...

1080
01:16:42,988 --> 01:16:45,479
why did you do it?

1081
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:47,923
Do what, dearest?
l don't know what you're talking about.

1082
01:16:47,993 --> 01:16:51,087
l was just getting some clothes ready
to go to the cleaners.

1083
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:57,258
So you had to be stupid.

1084
01:16:57,336 --> 01:17:00,931
You couldn't even play it smart
with a gun pointed at you.

1085
01:17:01,006 --> 01:17:04,271
You better get smart fast and get
out of here while you can still walk.

1086
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,907
lt's your friend.
Val? ls that his name?

1087
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:11,848
Yes, and you better get out of here
before he gets here.

1088
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:16,415
l'm sick, Sherry.

1089
01:17:16,488 --> 01:17:18,422
Call an ambulance.

1090
01:17:22,528 --> 01:17:24,758
The door's behind you.
Take a cab.

1091
01:17:25,964 --> 01:17:27,898
l love you, Sherry.

1092
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:31,529
You'd better go.
You look terrible.

1093
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:39,306
lt isn't fair.

1094
01:17:39,378 --> 01:17:42,040
l never had anybody but you.

1095
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:46,209
Not a real husband.

1096
01:17:46,285 --> 01:17:48,219
Not even a man.

1097
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:53,421
Just a bad joke
without a punch line.

1098
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:03,167
Ain't fair.

1099
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:23,844
American Airlines announces
the arrival of flight 808...

1100
01:18:23,922 --> 01:18:26,823
DC-7 service from Chicago.

1101
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:50,508
Sebastian and l are so excited.

1102
01:18:50,582 --> 01:18:54,541
We haven't seen daddy sweetums
for such a long, long time.

1103
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:58,317
Would the nice man let us wait outside
so we could look at the airplanes?

1104
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:00,381
You can stand outside
on the boarding ramp.

1105
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:03,360
We'll be announcing the arrival
of your husband's flight very shortly.

1106
01:19:03,428 --> 01:19:06,158
He's a sweetums man,
isn't hims?

1107
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:09,632
Let's hurry up real fast
and see daddy come off the airplane.

1108
01:19:10,903 --> 01:19:13,098
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1109
01:19:13,171 --> 01:19:16,436
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Preston,
9:00 flight for Boston.

1110
01:19:19,678 --> 01:19:23,774
We'll be announcing the on-time
departure of this flight very shortly.

1111
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:26,613
- Do you have any other baggage?
- lt was checked through this morning.

1112
01:19:26,685 --> 01:19:29,882
l wanna carry that bag
with me on the plane, please.

1113
01:19:29,955 --> 01:19:34,016
l'm sorry. lt's much too large. This'll
have to check through as baggage.

1114
01:19:34,092 --> 01:19:37,289
Now, let's be
a little reasonable, huh?

1115
01:19:37,362 --> 01:19:41,822
The two of us together are not entitled
to one piece of luggage between us?

1116
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,892
We have no objection
to one small bag.

1117
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:47,336
But we don't have anything else.
lt's already been checked through.

1118
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:49,067
l see.

1119
01:19:49,141 --> 01:19:52,633
Even though it's getting close to flight
time, we can locate your other luggage.

1120
01:19:52,711 --> 01:19:55,145
You could transfer the contents
of this to a smaller one.

1121
01:19:55,213 --> 01:19:57,238
That won't work at all.
Now look.

1122
01:19:57,316 --> 01:19:59,511
Let me talk to
your supervisor, huh?

1123
01:19:59,584 --> 01:20:03,145
l'll be very happy to call him.
Mr. Grimes?

1124
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:06,054
Mr. Grimes, could you
come down this way, please?

1125
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:11,994
- What can l do for you?
- My wife and l are going to Boston.

1126
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:15,227
Our luggage has been checked through,
and l wanna take this bag in the cabin.

1127
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,928
lt exceeds the maximum cabin size
for flight requirements.

1128
01:20:18,003 --> 01:20:21,063
lt does look quite a bit too large
for the passenger compartment.

1129
01:20:21,139 --> 01:20:24,836
Sir, those are our flight regulations,
designed for your comfort and safety.

1130
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:27,708
- l can't make the trip without it.
- You really can't?

1131
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:31,545
- Absolutely not.
- ln that case, l think we can--

1132
01:20:31,616 --> 01:20:33,709
l know it's past
cancellation time...

1133
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:36,845
but under the circumstances
l think we might stretch a point.

1134
01:20:36,922 --> 01:20:39,049
We'll give you full rebate
on your tickets.

1135
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:41,649
Wait a minute.
l don't want a rebate.

1136
01:20:41,727 --> 01:20:44,321
Well, sir, l don't know
what else to suggest.

1137
01:20:44,396 --> 01:20:46,921
lt's close to flight time.
There are other passengers waiting.

1138
01:20:46,999 --> 01:20:49,194
Perhaps the gentleman's
worried about the contents.

1139
01:20:49,267 --> 01:20:51,758
- We'd be happy to insure it.
- We'd be delighted.

1140
01:20:51,837 --> 01:20:54,271
lf you'd give me its estimated value
and tell me what's in it.

1141
01:20:54,339 --> 01:20:59,299
There's nothing in it.
Just personal items, things like that.

1142
01:20:59,378 --> 01:21:01,938
All right, check it through.

1143
01:21:02,014 --> 01:21:05,506
Thank you, sir. You'll find the service
to your complete satisfaction.

1144
01:21:05,584 --> 01:21:07,950
...flight 40,
the New Englander...

1145
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:12,013
DC-7 service to Boston
at gate eight.

1146
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,241
No, Sebastian.

1147
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:43,685
Was we frightened
by the airplane?

1148
01:21:43,755 --> 01:21:47,054
We go for trip
on nice airplane someday.

1149
01:22:05,844 --> 01:22:07,004
Come back here!

1150
01:22:51,256 --> 01:22:53,349
Mr. Preston,
we'll be announcing boarding--

1151
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,495
Grimes speaking. What?

1152
01:22:59,564 --> 01:23:02,397
Oh, you're not serious?

1153
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:04,799
Right out on the runway?

1154
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,804
Yes, sir.
Right away.

1155
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:14,945
Will passenger Preston...

1156
01:23:15,013 --> 01:23:18,380
please report to
the American Airlines ticket counter.

1157
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:26,384
Taxi!

1158
01:23:49,214 --> 01:23:51,546
Johnny, you've got to run.

1159
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:54,983
Nah. What's the difference?
