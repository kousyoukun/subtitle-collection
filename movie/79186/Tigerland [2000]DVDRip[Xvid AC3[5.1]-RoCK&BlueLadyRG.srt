1
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,452
<i>My father said the Army</i>
<i>makes all men one.</i>

2
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:56,045
<i>But you never know which one.</i>

3
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,845
<i>He didn't know Roland Bozz.</i>

4
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,844
Get up!

5
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:06,530
Get the fuck up!
Come on.

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,450
Get your fucking low-life asses
out of bed!

7
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,643
You got 15 minutes or you're
gonna do pushups until I pass out.

8
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:20,892
Let's go. Let's go.
Get up! Let's go!

9
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:23,968
Get your socks on and get outside,
you fucking pussies!

10
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,973
- Hurry up!
- Move!

11
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,484
- Ain't got all day.
- Move your ass, soldier.

12
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,888
Next time won't be
no weekend in the stockade.

13
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,968
It'll be a full-scale
motherfucking court-martial.

14
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:04,254
Maybe a few years hard time in
Leavenworth. How's that fly, dipshit?

15
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:08,445
Discounting reception, basic training
corrective custody...

16
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:13,046
...been in the Army more than three
months. Most of it in the stockade.

17
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:25,053
Get on that fucking deuce!
Get up on that deuce, boy!

18
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:29,363
You don't need no special
invitation, son!

19
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,248
Do as I ask! Hoist that
GI ass on that deuce!

20
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:35,453
Let's go. Get it done!
Get it done!

21
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,328
Private Bozz, Roland.
No middle initial.

22
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,133
You're going to infantry.

23
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,048
I bet my left nut
they bag and tag you in a week.

24
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,565
Any man tries that hard to get out
will never see home again.

25
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,448
I don't like the rehearsal,
so I'll skip the show.

26
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:00,050
Fuck you. Get on that deuce.
Let's go!

27
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,974
Bozz.

28
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:22,247
I got a buddy in Charlie Company
says he knows a fellow by that name.

29
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,005
Says he's the biggest fuck-up
in the Army.

30
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:29,454
Clowning around and always acting
like fucking bozo.

31
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:34,167
Article 15, recycled through basic,
all kinds of goldbrick shit.

32
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,445
Sounds to me like that fellow's
no more than a goddamn coward.

33
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,088
Afraid of Tigerland, huh?

34
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,444
Should be scared.

35
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,970
They hump your ass until it falls off.

36
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:50,689
- I heard a guy from Bravo died there.
- No, man, that's a rumor.

37
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:54,645
You afraid of big old Tigerland,
Private Fuck-up?

38
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:58,888
Read this and tell me what happens.
I gotta get away from this guy.

39
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,888
Go for it, Bozz!

40
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,484
Private Bozz!

41
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,448
What the fuck?
Stop the goddamn truck!

42
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,449
Goddamn it!
What the fuck is your problem?

43
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:23,328
You stupid motherfucker!
You're nothing but a...

44
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:25,850
Get back in that truck,
you little fuck!

45
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,888
The rest of you motherfuckers,
sit your asses down!

46
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:32,773
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

47
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:34,926
<i>My name is Captain Saunders.</i>

48
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,046
Commanding officer, Alpha Company.

49
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,246
Third advance infantry
training brigade.

50
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,486
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.

51
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,654
No matter where you did your basic,
either Fort Polk or elsewhere...

52
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:49,126
...rest assured that we train the
proudest, the toughest...

53
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,893
...the best-equipped soldiers.

54
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:55,088
This base is the largest supplier
of combat troops overseas.

55
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,968
So don't let any man here
start having any little...

56
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:01,167
...pasty fucking daydreams
about being anyplace else.

57
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:02,894
I shit you not, gentlemen.

58
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,969
You are headed for
a two-way firing range.

59
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,245
You will be sent to the war.

60
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:11,174
You will be here for an
eight-week training cycle.

61
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:14,054
After that, you will remain here
for a week more.

62
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:17,253
We will ship you to an outpost
10 miles from here...

63
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:21,693
...that is known throughout the Army
as the second worst place on earth.

64
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,254
Tigerland.

65
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:25,963
It is the stateside province
of Vietnam...

66
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:29,173
...and it is as close to the war
as we can make it.

67
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,173
Now, gentlemen,
it behooves you to learn...

68
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,650
...what little we can teach you here.

69
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,971
For if you do, then maybe...

70
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,364
...just maybe...

71
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:42,648
...you will return one day to play
stink-finger with Sally back home.

72
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:43,844
Let's get squared away.

73
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,365
Those of you not on detail
will have a pass for the weekend.

74
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,850
Training begins Monday at 0430.

75
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:53,889
From that time on, every
son of a bitch humps his own load.

76
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:09,207
- Sucky-sucky, baby?
- Oh, no, thank you.

77
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:27,843
There you go.

78
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:35,295
- You got a high sex drive.
- You're right.

79
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,644
Which line says that?

80
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,052
I'm no expert but it says
you're gonna have sex real soon.

81
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:43,653
- What about me?
- Sex for Sheri as well.

82
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:48,043
There you go.

83
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,573
- Did you read it?
- No, I didn't.

84
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:53,687
Me, neither. I keep it around
to piss everybody off.

85
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:54,884
Jim Paxton.

86
00:06:56,135 --> 00:07:00,048
Let's not become friends. You could
die and I'd miss you too much.

87
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,483
Excuse me?

88
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,774
It's a joke. Forget it.
Roland Bozz.

89
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,808
This here is Sheri and Claudia
or Claudia and Sheri.

90
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:10,414
Ladies, Jim Paxton.

91
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:13,334
- Good to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

92
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:15,127
Charmed, I'm sure.

93
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,645
- Let me buy you ladies a drink.
- Right on.

94
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,248
Four, please.

95
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,764
- You girls from here?
- Born and bred. You?

96
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,443
- Upstate New York.
- New York.

97
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,285
How about you, Bozz?
Where are you from?

98
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:30,532
Texas, Jim. It's in the
Southwestern part of the U.S.

99
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:34,569
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll double-check
that on the map. Thanks.

100
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,970
They came down hard on you in company.

101
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,854
- I'm surprised they let you off base.
- They didn't.

102
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:43,007
- I'm confined to company air.
- Oh, you're AWOL?

103
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:44,568
Man, the children.

104
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:47,050
To peace on earth
and a cure for cancer.

105
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:49,251
- Cheers.
- Amen.

106
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:52,248
Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.

107
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:56,251
Man, all I said was, "To peace on
earth and a cure for cancer."

108
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,049
- Who said it's a joke?
- You're doing a routine.

109
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,490
A funny soldier with
two girls in a bar...

110
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:03,373
Man, I'm not doing any routine.

111
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:06,288
If you're gonna be an asshole
about it, fuck you.

112
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,845
Now, Jim, that's not the answer.

113
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,849
Oh, really, smart-ass?
Then what is?

114
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,525
The answer is, I got a hotel room.

115
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:19,045
We're gonna take these ladies
and fuck till the war is over.

116
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:20,964
Okay.

117
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,411
Hello. This is fun.

118
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:52,083
Oh, really, really fun.

119
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,685
- It's not bad for a couple grunts.
- Not bad for a couple grunts?

120
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:58,170
Who are you?
Sergeant Rock, Easy Company?

121
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,924
Who are you playing?
Absurd man in an absurd world?

122
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:04,569
You're playing a fool
fighting the system.

123
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:07,164
- There's a difference, Paxton.
- Really, what?

124
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,254
I'm a failed fool.

125
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:14,126
Yeah, you've got a rep. I heard
you're the biggest fool around.

126
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,529
Oh, well, thank you.

127
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:18,488
But that's it.
I'm still here when I should be out.

128
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,845
- And I'm gonna get out.
- Not me.

129
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:22,408
I enlisted.

130
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,492
- Is this some war shit again?
- Yes.

131
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,327
- I got the munchies.
- Me too.

132
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:30,011
I wish I hadn't heard you say that.
I was starting to like you.

133
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:33,253
You know, I thought a lot
about it, Bozz.

134
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:34,854
I don't like the war.

135
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:38,405
Maybe I'm even against it.
But I'm not against my country.

136
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:41,175
Is there room service here?
Where's the phone?

137
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,253
That's some fancy
political thinking, professor.

138
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:47,453
Let me give you some advice.
Figure out a way to go.

139
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:50,163
- Get out, singing while you go.
- Guys, help us.

140
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,888
- We're hungry, you know?
- Me too, man.

141
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,645
You know, that's not all, man.
It's not just political.

142
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:00,853
I want to go.
I want to see what it's like.

143
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:04,172
I want the experience.
I'm taking notes on everything.

144
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,373
Shut up. I'm taking notes
on everything. One day...

145
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:11,403
One day I'll write something
like James Jones or Hemingway.

146
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:12,889
What will you write?

147
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:16,127
That war is hell, men are brave,
that kind of old crap?

148
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,731
So you've popped my fucking balloon.
Jesus Christ, Bozz.

149
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,250
- 24-hour place on Bourbon Street.

150
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,453
The girls are gone.

151
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:37,854
Yes, they are.

152
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:40,850
Okay.

153
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,248
Hey, how you doing?

154
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,443
Keep your head down.

155
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,488
Fucking AWOL, piece of shit
son of a bitch.

156
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:01,851
That bag of shit of yours in the dirt.

157
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:05,525
Private Bozz is showing the
proper way to dig a hole under fire.

158
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,687
Under fire, you will fall
to the earth and lie flat.

159
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,368
Under fire, you will ask God
to remove your button...

160
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:14,327
...to get closer to the ground.

161
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:17,931
Under fire you will dig a hole
with your teeth if you have to.

162
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,449
Open your mouth.

163
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:21,854
Now, shitbird.

164
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,204
Do it! Eat dirt!

165
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:27,248
I don't hear you. "Yes, sergeant."

166
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,727
- I'm still not hearing you.
- You wear a dress, sergeant?

167
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,054
- What did you say, you piece of crap?
- Go kiss my ass, sergeant!

168
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,690
You little finger-fucking cocksucker.

169
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,654
I will make you push Fort Polk
into the sea!

170
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:47,045
Sir, I already have a man in mind.

171
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,364
Thank you.

172
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,244
Eat dirt. Do it!

173
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:51,803
Do it! Eat dirt!

174
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,644
- Eat it!
- All right, sergeant, that's enough.

175
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:57,447
Get these men moving.

176
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,690
Move it! You heard the man.

177
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:02,894
Let's move it! Get going!

178
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:07,527
Miter, you're the new platoon guide,
the 2nd Platoon.

179
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:10,050
Get Bozz in line.
If it don't happen...

180
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:13,048
...even Jesus won't be able
to save you, understand?

181
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:16,173
- Yes, sergeant.
- Have these men fall in and fall out.

182
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,252
Platoon, fall in.

183
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,645
Fall out to your weapons.

184
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:31,887
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz, Bozz!

185
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,447
What is wrong with you, private?
Move your ass, son.

186
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,644
Let's go.

187
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:37,884
Move it!

188
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:39,654
- Bozz.
- Let's go!

189
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,971
Get that bag of shit in the dirt.

190
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,054
That's mine.

191
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,647
Platoon, listen up.

192
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,494
Platoon, we got a heavy day tomorrow.

193
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,054
Everybody hit the racks.

194
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,410
Lights out.

195
00:13:17,935 --> 00:13:21,245
- Lights out.
- You like being in control, boy?

196
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,443
I ain't took no shower.
I gotta take one.

197
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:29,764
God, shut up.

198
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,650
I don't fuck with you when you're
talking, so don't fuck with me.

199
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:36,649
Sergeant Thomas.

200
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,846
Private Cantwell reporting
to the weapon shed as ordered.

201
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,648
Sergeant Thomas?

202
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:21,045
Glad you waited up for me, Dad.

203
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,326
I think everybody did, Bozz.

204
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:27,570
This the scene where the troublemaker
gets beaten by his buddies?

205
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:29,294
Somebody got beaten.

206
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:31,844
Cantwell.

207
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:38,894
Jesus!

208
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,935
- What happened?
- I think it was Sergeant Thomas.

209
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:43,124
Damn it.

210
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:44,924
Anybody report it?

211
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,247
Why? It's not gonna put
his face back together.

212
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,650
He was trying
to fuck around like you.

213
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:54,172
I'm sorry this happened to you.

214
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,293
There ain't gonna be
no more clowning from you.

215
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,850
You hear?
Go wash up and hit the rack.

216
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:03,445
Shut your cake-hole, Miter.
You're giving Cantwell a headache.

217
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:08,124
I'm telling you, and that's like
getting an order from the sergeant.

218
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,445
Don't make me put you on report.

219
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,732
Give it a rest.
It's been a hard day for all of us.

220
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:16,933
Don't you give me a hard time, Paxton.
You're okay.

221
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:19,848
You'll be a good soldier,
but this individual...

222
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:24,453
He wants to be a bumblefuck.
He wants to laugh at everything we do.

223
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:26,287
He'll hurt this platoon.

224
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:28,247
What are you, 20 years old?

225
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:32,329
Just because you wear sergeant stripes
don't mean you ain't gonna die.

226
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,844
Where you going that we ain't, Bozz?

227
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:39,404
You best start to soldiering, boy,
or you're coming home in a bag.

228
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:10,444
Fuck.

229
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:22,369
Just wanted you to know,
I've taken a great dislike to you.

230
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,248
- Is there anything else, Wilson?
- No.

231
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:27,334
I don't reckon there is.

232
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:58,968
I'm gonna tell you something.
This is the last time you'll hear it.

233
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:01,445
You can't kill a dink with a ricochet.

234
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,647
Oh, this is all about killing people?
Well, shit.

235
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,851
So you can shoot when you want to.

236
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,448
When I want to.

237
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,686
Idea of killing dinks excite you?

238
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,251
Cease fire. Cease fire.

239
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:27,044
Get your targets, scumbags.

240
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:29,854
All clear.

241
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:35,048
You can't hit your targets,
there'll be hell to pay.

242
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:39,684
Shit, I do believe that's
Cantwell's target there, boys.

243
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:44,167
- Not a single bullet hole in it.
- Shut your cracker face, Wilson.

244
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,650
Sgt. Thomas'll chew my ass for chow.

245
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,449
You ain't gonna be making
any phone calls home.

246
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:54,132
You gonna be busy. All asses and
elbows, picking up ciggie butts.

247
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:57,088
You're a one-man campaign
to make the world uglier.

248
00:17:57,495 --> 00:18:00,726
- I ain't afraid of you, Bozz.
- Yes, you are, Wilson.

249
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:04,729
- You're just too stupid to realize it.
- Okay then, Sunday school.

250
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:08,251
You're such a goddamn saint,
give Cantwell your target.

251
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,413
- I'll give him yours.
- You take that and I'Il...

252
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:14,812
Jesus H. Christ, what's
the purpose of this clusterfuck?

253
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:17,848
- Wilson switched targets with Cantwell.
- That's true.

254
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,488
- That's bullshit.
- Lie down.

255
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,487
- Permission to...
- Now, shitbird!

256
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,054
Yes, sergeant.

257
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:27,050
You know why this man's on the ground?
Because he's dead!

258
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,047
He's dead.

259
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,924
And you can't bury him.
Do you know why?

260
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:34,285
- Why, sarge?
- Because you're dead too!

261
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,254
You're all dead...

262
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:39,845
...because you don't know how
to fire weapons on semi-automatic.

263
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:42,645
Or how to hit Charlie
with short bursts...

264
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,449
...so your goddamn barrels
don't overheat.

265
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:48,926
And because this shitbag
can't hit his fucking target.

266
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,528
Any questions?

267
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,532
- No, sergeant.
- I got a question.

268
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:55,448
If I'm dead, how come
I can ask you a question?

269
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:59,453
I know exactly what you're doing,
you pissant fairy.

270
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,449
I want you...

271
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,572
...and your two girlfriends here...

272
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:08,648
...to report to the mess sergeant
after chow tonight.

273
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:10,484
Get up, Lazarus.

274
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,448
You're resurrected.

275
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:15,688
Get up.

276
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:17,924
Cantwell.

277
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:36,450
You're getting a lot less funny, Bozz.

278
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,850
There's some big old
moon shining down.

279
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,845
Reminds you what this
world is all about.

280
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:46,565
- What, peeling potatoes?
- It's good you talk so slow, Cantwell.

281
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,726
Paxton there is taking notes.

282
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:50,647
Maybe he'll put you in a book.

283
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:54,052
Another one of his hokey characters:
The bumpkin saint.

284
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,255
I don't rightly know
what you're talking about.

285
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,053
I don't read much.

286
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,645
Never got past sixth grade.

287
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:07,853
Got married. Got a wife back home.

288
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:09,924
Poor little girl.

289
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,847
She has seizures.

290
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,529
These spells, you know?

291
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,608
Four children gotta go
without a mama now and again.

292
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,251
Jesus, Cantwell, when did you get
married? When you were 12?

293
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:22,610
Hell, no.

294
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:23,930
I was 15.

295
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,371
We had two together.
She had two previous.

296
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,169
I'm 19, but she's a might older.
She's 28.

297
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:35,044
I got a little boy who's 1
and a little girl who's 2.

298
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,450
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

299
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:44,647
Don't it strike you how
it's the same moon shining?

300
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,245
And it's shining down on us here...

301
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,646
...and shining down on
that little girl who's my wife.

302
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,643
It's the same moon...

303
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:55,045
...that'll be shining
when we go to war.

304
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:59,085
Same moon that's shining down on
those boys getting shot.

305
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:01,651
Don't it strike you what it means?

306
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:05,010
How each of us is a bit of everything.

307
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:08,050
And everything is shit.

308
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:11,889
I know that back home...

309
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:14,649
...preacher be talking about
right and wrong.

310
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:18,247
About the Lord and God and Jesus.

311
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,844
But you know...

312
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,849
...if the Lord or God or Jesus...

313
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:25,250
...be standing here right now...

314
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:27,368
...he'd say, "Cantwell...

315
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:32,165
...you forget about
all these promises.

316
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:35,244
You forget about what all anybody say.

317
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:39,251
And you forget about all them
big Sunday fancy ideas.

318
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:41,254
Even what we tell you.

319
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:44,849
You look up there.

320
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,052
Did you ever see such a moon?"

321
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:53,053
Goddamn it, Cantwell.

322
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:55,644
Shit.

323
00:21:58,095 --> 00:21:59,608
Shit.

324
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,249
Fuck, I don't even know you, man.

325
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:05,084
You sitting there
telling your fucking story.

326
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:11,048
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about?

327
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,243
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.

328
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:18,845
You shouldn't even be in this army.

329
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:23,044
You're just too stupid
to get yourself out.

330
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:25,053
I told them my predicament.

331
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:28,214
They said, "Wait till you go
to war, then complain."

332
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:30,093
And you bought that?

333
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,604
The man said it.

334
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:34,932
I know Army regulations
the way prisoners know the law.

335
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,012
You're a hardship discharge, man.

336
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:43,332
Okay. Look, I'll get you
out of the Army.

337
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:46,049
What are you saying?
You don't care about him.

338
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:49,412
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.

339
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,129
Just peel some
fucking potatoes or something.

340
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:57,331
- One, two, three.
- Two.

341
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:59,287
- One, two, three.
- Three.

342
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,531
- One, two, three.
- Four.

343
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:04,124
- One, two, three.
- Five.

344
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:18,373
Who put you up to this, son?

345
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:20,247
Nobody, sir.

346
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,806
- I know my rights.
- No, you don't.

347
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:26,849
Your case won't be reviewed until
after you're overseas. Dismissed.

348
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:31,727
No, sir.
I don't believe that's correct.

349
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:35,530
And I believe if you don't allow me
to see a J.A.G. Officer, sir...

350
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,454
...then under the uniform code
of military justice...

351
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:41,453
...I can file a complaint
with the inspector general.

352
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:42,969
And nobody can keep me.

353
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,048
Jesus Christ!

354
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:48,531
When did "My country, right or wrong"
turn into "Fuck this"?

355
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:52,045
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.

356
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,449
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.

357
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:58,050
I read it. In a book.

358
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:04,929
You read it? In a book?

359
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,048
Yes, sir.

360
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,252
How far did you get in school?

361
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:12,246
Almost sixth grade, sir.

362
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,845
I guess they study law early
where you come from.

363
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:21,167
<i>Sir, if I may speak frankly.</i>

364
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,173
You underestimate the harm
someone like Bozz can do.

365
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,854
He's bad for the Army, sir.

366
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:30,048
Haven't you heard? Everything's bad
for the Army these days. Even war.

367
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:34,646
Now drive your knee through his face.
Shove his brain through his ear. Good!

368
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,254
Thank you, sir.

369
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:39,488
What's your solution?
Shit-can him out of the Army?

370
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:41,885
Of course not. That's what he wants.

371
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:43,847
- Exactly.
- Court-martial him.

372
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,886
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.

373
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:48,529
Sergeant, you know we won't
court-martial him.

374
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:50,532
It'll cost beaucoup dollars...

375
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:54,523
...and battalion will ask why I can't
keep one asshole trainee in line.

376
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:57,488
Five weeks from now,
he'll be in the war.

377
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:01,005
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad. Sure as shit.

378
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:04,525
Maybe not. Got Cantwell out.
Two other guys from his squad.

379
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:09,126
Every son of a bitch J.A.G. Shrink
bleeding heart pissed down on us.

380
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:10,324
That's Bozz, sir.

381
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:13,003
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.

382
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:15,251
Sergeant, we are losing a war.

383
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:18,447
The whole goddamn Army
is falling apart.

384
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:22,364
You want me to fiddle-fuck around
with one smart-ass barracks lawyer?

385
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,452
I think he's something more, sir.

386
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:28,045
- Is that all, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

387
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:33,845
What the hell you doing, soldier?!
Goddamn it, Bozz!

388
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:37,365
You're supposed to strangle him,
not become his fuck buddy!

389
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:38,849
Yes, sergeant.

390
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:08,773
Pussy-fucking-coward.

391
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,525
What the fuck you looking at,
you bunch of no-nut sad sacks?

392
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:16,203
Get your little pussies back to work!

393
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:23,494
You try that again,
you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.

394
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:29,929
Now get those little pussies
back to work...

395
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:33,252
...you bunch of sad sack,
no-nut fuck-ups!

396
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,286
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.

397
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:40,289
He's two-stepping from the poorhouse
with a crazy wife. I envy him.

398
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:41,848
You saved his life.

399
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:44,888
Shit, sometimes when we talk,
my stomach hurts.

400
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,848
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.

401
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:50,126
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.

402
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,530
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.

403
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:55,124
Know what would settle your ass?
A blanket party.

404
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:57,803
Put a blanket over you,
hit you with a rock.

405
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:00,654
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.

406
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:03,164
- Both of you can walk back...
- You bastard...

407
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,252
...you think you so damn smart.

408
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:08,253
I hear Northern boys
are the first to go in Vietnam.

409
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:11,049
Yeah, but at least
we can find it on a map.

410
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,408
Real fucking funny, Pax.

411
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,448
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.

412
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:20,330
Ain't nobody gonna die? Shit, Miter,
you're one damn dumb cracker.

413
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:23,925
When you go home, they'll call you
"Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker."

414
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:26,729
- That any better?
- You watch yourself, mister.

415
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:29,290
I still got these stripes.
Acting sarge.

416
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:32,407
You're chicken without
that stripe down your back.

417
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:36,608
- I ain't seen a dink that can take me.
- Jesus, Wilson, you a dumb-fuck.

418
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:39,204
Them motherfuckers
killed the Chinese ass...

419
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:41,770
...and the French ass.
They gonna kick ours.

420
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:46,685
- Who are you? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard"?
- My brother was there in '68.

421
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:48,288
Don't make you no hero.

422
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:50,645
You know what your problem is, Wilson?

423
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,014
You need to listen for the pop.

424
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,046
What's "the pop," Johnson?

425
00:27:57,535 --> 00:28:01,847
The sound you'll make when your head
exits your ass for the first time.

426
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,053
Damn, Johnson,
I know you a damn coward.

427
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:08,485
Now I believe you a damn communist.

428
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:12,085
Maybe a damn faggot alongside
being a goddamn nigger.

429
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:14,650
- Oh, hell no!
- Ain't this some shit.

430
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:19,727
- Want a piece of me, chump?
- Get him!

431
00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:21,527
- Get him!
- Get off of me.

432
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,174
Get off, motherfucker!

433
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,444
Come on!

434
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,054
That's enough.

435
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:40,894
Which one of you motherfuckers
killed my truck?

436
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,687
- Get off me, man!
- Get off!

437
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,773
All right, now, you truckload of shit.

438
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,529
Fess up, or the whole
damn drag-ass squad...

439
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:51,852
...does the airborne shuffle
six miles back to base.

440
00:28:53,255 --> 00:28:55,894
Goddamn it, shit for brains!
Who did it?

441
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:01,568
I did it, sergeant.

442
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,367
Good. Come down here, boy.

443
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:05,247
And bring your shit!

444
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:11,044
Rest of you, sit your asses down.

445
00:29:31,615 --> 00:29:34,732
Nobody saves anybody,
you stupid son of a bitch.

446
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,971
What the fuck are you doing, man?

447
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:39,251
It's not doing me any favors.

448
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,770
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2.

449
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:51,330
Miter has properly demonstrated...

450
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:55,050
...the use of the TA-312 field radio.

451
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:59,044
Except for this,
which is not in the manual.

452
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,846
If you ever catch Charlie...

453
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:05,127
...you might want info on where
the rest of his buddies is.

454
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:09,886
Only Charlie is a close-lipped
bastard who won't tell you fuck all.

455
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:13,764
That's why you tie his gook hands,
take down his gook pants...

456
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:16,449
...and grab his gook balls.

457
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:18,613
Here, Miter, hold these.

458
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:21,887
You pinch these clips on each
of his slant-eyed nuts...

459
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,450
...and you juice up the radio...

460
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:31,490
...that'll send enough shock so
he'll tell you anything you want.

461
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:34,812
Hell, he'll tell you
the minor league baseball scores.

462
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:36,687
- You read me?
- Yes, sergeant.

463
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:41,525
He'll tell you how his mother wipes
her ass if you give him this juice.

464
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:45,648
Not only that, you'll be able
to find him real easy next time.

465
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:48,449
Because he'll light up
the fucking night.

466
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:58,733
No one said you could leave.

467
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:01,292
- Why?
- Why what?

468
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,850
Why would I do that
to another human being?

469
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:08,929
Brother's right.

470
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:12,252
What the fuck's wrong with you?
That's one of your men.

471
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:14,128
Get him back here, boy.

472
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:15,563
- Bozz!
- Go get him, boy.

473
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:17,254
Jesus, Bozz.

474
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:19,134
Don't do this to me.

475
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,532
Get back here,
you worthless sack of shit!

476
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:29,607
You can't control your own men,
it is your ass.

477
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:31,248
Drop trou.

478
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:34,013
- What?
- Drop trou!

479
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:38,484
Double-time, come on! Skivvies too.

480
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:44,049
Well, what do you know?
You do have a pair of balls after all.

481
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,049
Wilson, get over here.
Crank this thing.

482
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,611
We'll now demonstrate
the proper way...

483
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:53,046
...to give information
when connected to the TA-312.

484
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:56,247
See if you can tell me
why you can't control your men.

485
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,851
See if you light up tonight.

486
00:32:01,495 --> 00:32:03,531
- Light him up.
- Shut the fuck up, Hicks.

487
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:04,804
Contact.

488
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,932
Never even touched you, son.

489
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:18,644
That's it. Class dismissed.
Go on to your next class.

490
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:20,243
Go on.

491
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:22,848
Go on!

492
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:30,124
Wilson, looks like we're having
roasted nuts tonight, huh?

493
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:32,769
I didn't know you
was so goddamn funny.

494
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:02,771
I can't wait to catch me a VC,
spark his balls off.

495
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,127
I'll start with you tonight, Miter.

496
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:07,724
Got this, Pax?
The crazed, sadistic soldier...

497
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:09,374
...who flips out and kills people.

498
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:11,725
I think I saw you look at
Miter's balls earlier.

499
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,846
Funny there, Bozz. Funny, yeah.

500
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:17,411
You're a disgrace to the uniform,
fucking piece of shit!

501
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:19,526
Hey! Hey, what the fuck?

502
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:23,005
Break it up, man!

503
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:27,691
Get the fuck up! Civilian bullshit!

504
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:31,130
What the hell is going on? Miter!

505
00:33:31,335 --> 00:33:34,611
You better do some fast explaining
or your men in a world of hurt.

506
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:36,447
There was an argument...

507
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:39,931
...and one of the men...
...- Slipped on the soap in the shower.

508
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:42,012
Wrestling. It got out of hand.

509
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:45,013
It happens when people live together,
fuck together.

510
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:52,012
Sorry, soldier, you must've
slipped on some soap yourself.

511
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:53,490
What's wrong with you?

512
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:56,807
Look like you ate some frozen shit
for breakfast.

513
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:02,010
Nothing's wrong, sergeant.

514
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:05,247
It better stay that way,
you read me? All of you.

515
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:10,005
- Goddamn it, do you hear me?
- Yes, sergeant!

516
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:15,133
You got guard duty. Four listening
posts at the edge of the perimeter.

517
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:17,610
Dig yourself a hole and
forget about chow.

518
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,610
Out here, you're challenged on guard
duty. And you do it by the book.

519
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,494
But in Nam, if you hear something
in the bushes...

520
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:28,726
...I mean anything, you open fire.

521
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:32,325
You fire into those bushes until
you kill whatever made that sound.

522
00:34:32,575 --> 00:34:35,043
When the sun comes up,
I don't give a fuck...

523
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:38,372
...whether it's man, woman, child
or little Johnny next door.

524
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,691
Kill it or you're not coming home.

525
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:42,647
Like the My Lai massacre, sergeant?

526
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:47,724
Paxton...

527
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:50,210
...why don't you join
your asshole buddy?

528
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,806
Missing a meal would be good for
your wisecracking ass also.

529
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:58,572
Now let's fall back in for chow!

530
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:02,245
Goddamn it, do it now!
You want to march six miles tonight?

531
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:04,093
Fucking weapons at ease!

532
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:09,013
Feel like I'm digging
my own fucking grave here.

533
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:12,213
When I was a kid...

534
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:15,205
...I used to think I could
dig my way to China.

535
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:18,009
You watched too many cartoons, Jim.

536
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:22,733
Maybe if we dig long and hard enough,
we'll tunnel our way out of this dump.

537
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,209
Why don't you?

538
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,813
My arm's too tired.

539
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:31,011
No, really. Why don't you get
yourself out of the Army?

540
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:33,613
I'm not that brave.

541
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:39,610
In that case, I'll just have to
bury you myself!

542
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,011
Move it out! Come on, move it out!

543
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,490
Stay the fuck down!

544
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:52,568
Stay the fuck where you are!

545
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,333
Move! You got to move it!

546
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:57,572
Stay the fuck down!
They're firing in our path!

547
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,247
- Move it!
- Cease fire.

548
00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:04,013
Miter! What the hell's
wrong with you?

549
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:07,129
When your men are told to move out,
they move out!

550
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,127
When I give orders,
you're supposed to jump.

551
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,888
- Do you read me?
- Yes, sergeant!

552
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:14,605
The M-60s fired directly across
our path! They'd have cut us in two!

553
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:18,450
Who told you to open your fucking
mouth? Miter's platoon guide!

554
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,607
You gotta flank that M-60!
Is that clear?

555
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:23,291
Yes, sir.

556
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:25,611
If you want these
dumb-ass bitches dead...

557
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:27,811
...you wouldn't take them
in the belly of a pig...

558
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:29,886
...with a 762 to split their skull!

559
00:37:30,135 --> 00:37:32,091
You flank the objective!

560
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:33,734
- You read me?
- Yes, sergeant!

561
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,773
- Get these fucking men out the hole!
- Move it out!

562
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,647
Stay down! Stay down!

563
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:41,049
Stay down!

564
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:43,723
What did you say, maggot-brained
son of a bitch?!

565
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:44,970
I said, stay down.

566
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:46,893
Get these men out the hole now!

567
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:49,933
- Platoon guide, do it! Move it!
- Come on, goddamn it!

568
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,011
Stay down.

569
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:54,683
Are you stupid enough
to fuck with me, boy?

570
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,485
Tomorrow at base
it's you, me and the captain.

571
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:00,932
If your insubordinate ass ain't
in stockade by midday chow...

572
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:02,887
...I'll kill you myself!

573
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:06,811
You won't kill me, sergeant.

574
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:10,408
I don't know what you'll do to me,
but you won't kill me.

575
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:17,805
- Goddamn you, boy!
- Out of the trench!

576
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,454
Don't turn your back on me!

577
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,930
Get your ass with the other men now!

578
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,207
I understand your position. I ain't
trying to fuck things up for you.

579
00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:28,811
You got your army to run and people
to kill. I'm not part of it.

580
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:30,488
Nobody quits the Army.

581
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:32,009
I'm not quitting...

582
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:34,251
...I'm just not playing.

583
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,406
What's your first name, sergeant?

584
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:39,124
Ezra.

585
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:40,803
Ezra.

586
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,568
Can I offer you a smoke?

587
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:50,251
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

588
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,810
That doesn't fucking do it!

589
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:54,693
That doesn't fucking do it!

590
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,210
Give me a fucking answer!

591
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:58,809
Fuck!

592
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:01,805
Now you listen to me, son.

593
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,326
I been to where you're going.

594
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:08,447
Over there, you go from
living to dead awful quick.

595
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:12,330
What I'm trying to teach you may
save your worthless life, maybe.

596
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:16,727
I tell you what. If you snap shit
and soldier like I know you can...

597
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:19,529
...I'll forget about this.
- Can't.

598
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:23,011
Shit, even if I wanted to,
I'm not there anymore.

599
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,845
What kind of bullshit
statement is this?

600
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:27,443
Ezra, no.

601
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,213
It's just me.

602
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:32,407
Okay, Bozz, all right.

603
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:34,168
I'm gonna let you go.

604
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,809
But now it's you
and the CO, I'm out of it.

605
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:41,651
Soldier, this army's gonna come down
on your ass hard. Both feet.

606
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:43,374
You know that, don't you?

607
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:47,409
They'll push through your papers
and send you where the dying's sweet.

608
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,208
Is this a trick?

609
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,609
Trying to make me a hero
or something?

610
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:58,764
Nope.

611
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:01,968
Well, good, Ezra.

612
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:05,606
Now you get your ass up and
join these men right now.

613
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:09,532
You're a big fucking baby!
Get out of my sight.

614
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:17,806
- Miter!
- What's he doing?

615
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:21,174
- Sergeant Landers!
- Goddamn it, what is it now?

616
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:38,606
- That's enough, sergeant.
- You got some fucking nerve, shitbag!

617
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:45,451
Come on!

618
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,215
Time to go home, soldier!

619
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:51,011
I said, that's enough!

620
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:53,010
Let's go.

621
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:04,415
Goddamn it, you men will
learn to soldier.

622
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:08,330
The next dick tries a stunt like that
gets my size-14 Deltas...

623
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:11,174
...so far up their ass
they'll choke on the heel!

624
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:14,811
- Do you understand!
- Yes, sergeant!

625
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,807
You! Paxton!

626
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:21,135
- How much school have you had?
- Two years of college.

627
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:24,008
You're the next platoon guide.
Arrest him.

628
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,410
They didn't teach us
how to do that in college.

629
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,732
Are you some kind of fucking idiot?
You inbred retard.

630
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:32,011
You don't know how to do a thing,
do you?

631
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:34,046
Tell the man he's under arrest...

632
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:37,014
...he's confined to barracks,
he won't leave the area.

633
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:40,013
You get a card table
and set it up at the door!

634
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:41,449
Why, sergeant?

635
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:45,330
So a guard can sit there, you
backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.

636
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,003
You're fired as platoon guide,
dumb-ass dipshit!

637
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:52,608
You think that's funny?!

638
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:53,611
Goddamn it!

639
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:57,211
Goddamn it! Give me 10, you
think it's fucking funny!

640
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:02,005
- Wilson!
- Yes, sergeant.

641
00:42:02,415 --> 00:42:04,007
Get a card table.

642
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,324
You're on guard.

643
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,694
Guard, sergeant?

644
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,011
You heard me!
You want these 14s up your ass?

645
00:42:13,255 --> 00:42:14,608
No, sergeant!

646
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:22,050
Bozz.

647
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,483
You're new platoon guide.

648
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:27,409
You put that piece of shit
under arrest.

649
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:31,204
You tell these men to get their
haircuts. Every swinging dick.

650
00:42:31,455 --> 00:42:33,605
Congratulations, sweetheart.

651
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:36,527
Sorry about that, Jim.

652
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:37,884
Oh, man.

653
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:38,965
Jealous?

654
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:40,851
Miter.

655
00:42:41,055 --> 00:42:42,613
How you doing, man?

656
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:50,811
Okay, guys!

657
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:53,933
I ain't taking any of this
shit seriously.

658
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:57,406
Just do what you have to do
so we can live together.

659
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:00,123
If any of you are gonna run off
and hide, let me know.

660
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:02,485
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.

661
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:06,051
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army. Hear me?

662
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,928
Sit the fuck down at your
dumb card table, punk.

663
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:11,373
Hey, fellas. Hey!

664
00:43:11,775 --> 00:43:15,131
Look, all I know is that no one's
talked to me like that...

665
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,924
...since I got in this goddamned
green mean machine.

666
00:43:19,215 --> 00:43:20,967
- Damn right.
- I attest to that.

667
00:43:21,175 --> 00:43:24,406
So yeah, Bozz.
See what happens, baby.

668
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:27,886
What else they gonna do, send us
to Viet-fucking-Nam?

669
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:29,170
Too late for that.

670
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,609
Say, Bozz? Can I get a weekend pass?

671
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:37,409
Put your panties away,
your mama's panties.

672
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:41,605
They're your mama's panties. You
ain't been laid in three years.

673
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:44,610
Get me off this base, I'll show you!

674
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:50,014
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.

675
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,770
Take a deep breath.

676
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:55,408
Take this shit off.

677
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:01,413
You gotta relax.

678
00:44:50,535 --> 00:44:52,730
Shit, you gonna run again?

679
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:55,495
I hear people in New Orleans
help me get to Mexico.

680
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:56,605
It ain't that easy.

681
00:44:56,815 --> 00:44:59,409
Army's got men, their whole job's
to look for you.

682
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,804
I don't care.

683
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:04,007
They'll catch you, bring you here
and put you in prison.

684
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:08,133
You best move, don't make me
have to thump you.

685
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:10,974
Want to go to military prison?
You're not that crazy.

686
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:17,083
Shut the fuck up!

687
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:21,411
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake
up Wilson. You don't want that.

688
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,812
Shit. What you gonna do now?

689
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:39,205
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.

690
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,650
- Shit, man, that won't work.
- Watch!

691
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,004
I said, that won't work!

692
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:46,008
Bust my hand, they'll have to
let me out. Right?

693
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:48,524
- It ain't gonna work.
- Come on, Bozz!

694
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:51,812
Break my goddamn hand
so I can go home!

695
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:11,247
You know what I am, Bozz?
I'm a butcher.

696
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,774
Yeah, we all butchers.

697
00:46:12,975 --> 00:46:14,727
No, I'm a real butcher.

698
00:46:14,935 --> 00:46:18,610
- You haven't killed anyone yet.
- Goddamn it, I mean a real butcher!

699
00:46:18,855 --> 00:46:21,653
Back home. I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.

700
00:46:21,895 --> 00:46:24,568
Did it in high school,
did it after high school.

701
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:27,728
I could cut you a piece of meat
so clean...

702
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:30,403
...it'll have you praying
to beefsteak.

703
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:35,206
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.

704
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:42,204
You laughing at me?

705
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:45,652
No, Miter. I ain't laughing at you.

706
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:51,006
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.

707
00:46:51,215 --> 00:46:52,807
I didn't make no money.

708
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:55,410
Just a store boy,
that's what my daddy said.

709
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:57,646
"Hey, store boy. Hey, boy!"

710
00:46:57,855 --> 00:47:02,326
Called me boy. Imagine that? Shit
kicker, calling me boy all the time.

711
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:04,412
I ain't a boy, goddamn it!

712
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,210
Telling me how he's
a big fancy war hero!

713
00:47:07,455 --> 00:47:09,411
And my wife, that little...

714
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,413
My wife.

715
00:47:21,295 --> 00:47:22,728
She's pretty.

716
00:47:23,655 --> 00:47:25,725
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.

717
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:34,808
Prettiest girl
in the state of Louisiana.

718
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:41,207
She was mad at me because
I was working all the time.

719
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:43,213
Giving her the money...

720
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,054
...for junior college.

721
00:47:46,255 --> 00:47:48,211
I knowed then, like...

722
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:50,811
...like I knowed later on...

723
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:55,411
...she was seeing a fucking
college boy on the side!

724
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:57,287
Goddamn it! My daddy said it.

725
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:01,323
He said, "See? See what a dumb-ass
bastard you are?

726
00:48:01,575 --> 00:48:03,884
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.

727
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:07,093
You ought to have a little ring
in your nose."

728
00:48:07,295 --> 00:48:11,254
So you thought you'd join the Army
and kill yourself like a real man.

729
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:15,847
Bozz, I know you can get people out.

730
00:48:16,455 --> 00:48:17,808
Maybe.

731
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:21,605
Even in this wild-ass nonsense,
some rules fly by.

732
00:48:22,535 --> 00:48:26,608
Please, Bozz. Please get me
out of here. Please?

733
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:47,410
Well, look here.

734
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,843
Goddamn.

735
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:53,088
That captain sure didn't want
to let me go at first.

736
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:54,654
But I did like you said.

737
00:48:54,855 --> 00:48:57,415
Told him the Army wants me
to see a psychiatrist.

738
00:48:57,655 --> 00:49:01,204
- And that was it, huh?
- I wanted to thank you personally.

739
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,683
Doctor sent me on leave.

740
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:06,086
He'll contact the Red Cross,
get me out-processed...

741
00:49:06,295 --> 00:49:07,853
...so I don't have to come back.

742
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,968
Good, Miter. Glad to hear
you're nuts, man.

743
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:16,610
- Best of luck, Miter.
- Thanks, Paxton.

744
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:19,414
Take care, Johnson.

745
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:23,931
Thanks again, Bozz.

746
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:30,166
- So long.
- Go be a butcher, Miter!

747
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:34,004
- Try not to get shot, hear?
- Don't let your meat loaf, man.

748
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:44,167
Yeah, fuck you.

749
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:56,206
- Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

750
00:49:56,415 --> 00:49:59,213
So you're the new platoon
guide for 2nd Platoon?

751
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:00,291
Yes, sir.

752
00:50:00,495 --> 00:50:03,134
The fucking world is full
of fucking surprises.

753
00:50:03,495 --> 00:50:06,168
It wasn't your plan to wear
sergeant's stripes...

754
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,525
...a week away from
Tigerland in a war.

755
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:12,011
I don't know, sir. The idea
crossed my mind now and again.

756
00:50:12,215 --> 00:50:15,207
I just didn't think it would
all be so pitiful sad.

757
00:50:20,615 --> 00:50:22,526
Been looking over your 201.

758
00:50:22,735 --> 00:50:24,612
You're a Texas boy.

759
00:50:25,175 --> 00:50:28,451
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.

760
00:50:28,655 --> 00:50:30,213
Dropout, worked construction.

761
00:50:30,415 --> 00:50:32,133
- Get drafted?
- Yes, sir.

762
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:37,130
- Why didn't you stay in school?
- Maybe I needed some trouble, sir.

763
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,808
Well, you got it.

764
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:43,289
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.

765
00:50:43,935 --> 00:50:47,405
The company's like the bad end of a
shit storm. Your platoon's the worst.

766
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:51,005
- Thank you, sir.
- That's not a compliment, smart-ass.

767
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,484
I don't want any more calls
from battalion...

768
00:50:55,695 --> 00:50:58,004
...asking me why this troopie needs
a hardship discharge...

769
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,008
...and that troopie needs
some kind of a mental wet nurse.

770
00:51:01,255 --> 00:51:03,166
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

771
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,014
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.

772
00:51:09,255 --> 00:51:11,644
A week from now you'll ship out
to Tigerland.

773
00:51:11,855 --> 00:51:14,688
That'll crawl in your skull
and look out your eyes.

774
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:16,732
So let's start fresh.

775
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:19,733
- Give your people a weekend pass.
- Already done it, sir.

776
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:27,813
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.

777
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:32,166
I believe you could soldier as well
as any man in this army.

778
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,048
I even think you want to,
but you won't.

779
00:51:36,015 --> 00:51:38,210
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

780
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:43,970
We're fighting a war, private. Nobody
knows how he's gonna come back.

781
00:51:45,255 --> 00:51:47,974
That's not the kind of alive
I'm talking about, sir.

782
00:51:48,295 --> 00:51:49,808
Here's 150 bucks.

783
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:05,606
Happy Halloween!

784
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:09,283
Cough it up, Brian.

785
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:10,651
Next time, Pax.

786
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:12,607
- Catch you later, buddy.
- All right.

787
00:52:21,335 --> 00:52:23,405
Who's that girl you're
talking to, Bozz?

788
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:27,849
- Trying to score some weed.
- Know what I don't get?

789
00:52:28,055 --> 00:52:31,092
Why they haven't tossed you
out on some lunatic discharge...

790
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:33,525
...some bullshit like that.
- I ain't crazy.

791
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,652
You're out of your fucking mind.

792
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:39,609
My reasons are my reasons and
no one has to like them.

793
00:52:39,815 --> 00:52:42,613
What about these fucking war games?
What if it's a lie?

794
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:45,813
What if the guys who tell you and me
shit to do were lied to also?

795
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,891
Maybe since everyone believes
in the same mistake, you know...

796
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:52,171
...maybe they're all as confused
as we are.

797
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,412
All this "Boy's boy,
man's man" bullshit.

798
00:52:55,615 --> 00:52:57,173
Ever feel you're just being stupid?

799
00:52:57,535 --> 00:53:01,084
Yeah. And it gives me a warm,
gooey feeling inside too.

800
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:20,930
Oh, man, we need women, Pax!

801
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,563
Oh, I hear you, buddy!

802
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:30,653
I hear your asshole's tighter
than a migraine.

803
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,811
- Fuck you!
- Hey, man.

804
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:35,810
- You're Bozz, right?
- Uh-huh.

805
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:40,533
Fellas say that if you don't
want to go to Nam...

806
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,807
...you better pray to Jesus
or talk to Roland Bozz.

807
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,013
- Better start praying to Jesus, then.
- Sorry, kid!

808
00:53:47,415 --> 00:53:49,406
- Oh, my God, look here.
- Oh, Jesus!

809
00:53:49,615 --> 00:53:52,004
- I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble!
- You are!

810
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,974
- Come here, baby.
- I'll come if you got some money.

811
00:53:55,175 --> 00:53:58,133
- I might have some money.
- You might or you do?

812
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,128
- You better have some.
- That's what I need to see.

813
00:54:01,335 --> 00:54:03,053
- You want to see it?
- Yeah, I do.

814
00:54:03,255 --> 00:54:05,450
- You got me covered, right?
- Here it is.

815
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:09,443
As I was about to come, I let out a
fart. Should've seen her face.

816
00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:12,692
Heard it in the next room.
Thought a grenade went off.

817
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:14,806
- How was yours?
- Expensive.

818
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:17,091
- You feel guilty?
- Because I'm broke?

819
00:54:17,335 --> 00:54:20,611
I figured you for a guy
who left a sweetheart back home.

820
00:54:20,815 --> 00:54:23,170
- She left me.
- That's why you joined the Army.

821
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:26,924
- Go on, confess.
- No, she broke it off when I enlisted.

822
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:29,808
- Didn't want to be a widow.
- She's got a point.

823
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:31,607
After all this bullshit...

824
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:35,211
...you still want to go kill women
and children in rice paddies?

825
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:39,730
- Come on, Paxton!
- Where you going, Bozz?

826
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:42,011
- I have no idea.
- Fuck.

827
00:54:42,255 --> 00:54:46,294
- We are gonna jump, my young friend!
- Shit, Bozz, I'm too drunk.

828
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:49,009
- Come on, Paxton.
- I'll break my neck.

829
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:51,604
I don't want to go without you,
man.

830
00:54:52,175 --> 00:54:54,006
All right, I see what this is.

831
00:54:54,215 --> 00:54:57,207
This jump, it's like this
existential leap of faith.

832
00:54:57,455 --> 00:54:59,605
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I have no idea what that means.

833
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:02,010
We'll break those legs
and get out of the war.

834
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,570
- Okay, let's go.
- That's it, here we go.

835
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:06,413
- I'm ready.
- That's it.

836
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:09,852
It's gonna be on my count,
it'll be one, two, three.

837
00:55:10,055 --> 00:55:12,046
- Let's break those legs.
- Okay, one!

838
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:13,404
Two!

839
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:15,009
Three!

840
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:18,810
- Was that the count?
- That was the count.

841
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:23,208
- Okay, okay.
- Here we go, here we go.

842
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:25,929
- Hot girl.
- Oh, yeah, hot girl.

843
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,126
On my count again, one, two, three.

844
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:30,408
Okay, one!

845
00:55:30,655 --> 00:55:32,008
Two!

846
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:33,609
Three!

847
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:38,207
The legs won't move. Shit.

848
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:42,414
They're out for themselves.
Goddamn it.

849
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:51,814
If that bottle was a leg, we'd be
out of the war about now.

850
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:56,853
- Looks like that would really hurt.
- Oh, fuck.

851
00:56:03,855 --> 00:56:08,406
Canadian Atlantic Railway.
There's your ride out of here, Bozz.

852
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,403
Go to Canada and live with
a fucking moose? No way, man.

853
00:56:12,615 --> 00:56:16,210
Mexico, that's where I'd disappear to.
Can't you just smell it?

854
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:18,923
See it? Shit, I can
smell it from here.

855
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:23,805
All that sunshine and tequila. All
those little <i>seoritas</i> walking around.

856
00:56:26,615 --> 00:56:28,412
- Would you...
- What?

857
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:31,648
If I told you about people
who can get us to Mexico...

858
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,005
...away from the war, would you go?

859
00:56:36,055 --> 00:56:36,851
No.

860
00:56:38,935 --> 00:56:39,811
No, I wouldn't.

861
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,014
I enlisted, so there's a place for me.

862
00:56:44,055 --> 00:56:46,091
If I don't go, somebody
has to take that place.

863
00:56:47,815 --> 00:56:49,407
And if they die, well...

864
00:56:50,215 --> 00:56:52,012
...they're dying for me.

865
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:56,007
You're a brave man.

866
00:56:56,975 --> 00:56:59,808
- You're the brave one, Bozz.
- Bullshit.

867
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:05,807
Courage is when you're the only guy
who knows how shit-scared you are.

868
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:08,808
Then you're right.

869
00:57:09,055 --> 00:57:10,807
I am the brave one.

870
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:14,813
Let's get out of here.
We gotta get back.

871
00:57:15,055 --> 00:57:18,206
Fucking Sergeant Thomas
will chew my ass for chow!

872
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:29,808
- Anytime today, Private Paxton.
- I'm coming, Private Bozz.

873
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:32,004
Fuck.

874
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:37,808
We should have jumped.

875
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:39,209
Yeah.

876
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,407
We can always go back.

877
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,213
Come on, man.

878
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:22,404
Fight!

879
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:27,244
Calm the fuck down here!
Calm the fuck down!

880
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:29,008
Get him, Bozz!

881
00:58:31,935 --> 00:58:33,607
Get him, Bozz, get him!

882
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:13,010
Let him go! You're gonna hurt
him, Bozz, let him go!

883
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:14,529
Let him go, Bozz!

884
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:18,125
Let him go! Come on! Get off!
Goddamn it!

885
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:32,686
Damn you, Paxton. Let them fight.

886
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:34,330
Shut the fuck up.

887
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:36,810
You know he deserved every bit of it!

888
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:46,809
Took four hours for
my nose to stop bleeding.

889
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:49,251
Get off it, Wilson!
You had it coming, man!

890
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:52,811
- I was just fucking with him.
- If Paxton here had kept quiet...

891
00:59:53,055 --> 00:59:55,853
...boy, you'd be in hell right now,
sure as shit!

892
00:59:57,655 --> 01:00:00,453
If I knew Bozz would stop,
I wouldn't have said anything.

893
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:02,974
Apologize, Bozz.

894
01:00:03,175 --> 01:00:04,164
Get off it.

895
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,808
You heard me, Bozz.

896
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,805
You apologize to me right now.

897
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:11,649
Yeah, Bozz. Apologize to the man.

898
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:15,609
Say, "I'm sorry I didn't
kill your ass!"

899
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:19,288
Think that's funny?

900
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:22,214
Fuck.

901
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:27,246
You tried to embarrass me in front
of every fucking person here.

902
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:29,808
Apologize.

903
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:43,406
<i>Cease firing!</i>

904
01:00:43,735 --> 01:00:45,214
<i>Clear your weapons!</i>

905
01:00:48,335 --> 01:00:50,212
<i>Weapons clear.</i>

906
01:00:50,975 --> 01:00:53,409
<i>Next group on the line, let's move!</i>

907
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:01,774
<i>Next group on the line!</i>

908
01:01:05,735 --> 01:01:07,327
- Weapon safe?
- Yeah, all clear.

909
01:01:07,535 --> 01:01:08,809
Take a mag.

910
01:01:11,615 --> 01:01:13,207
<i>Ready on the right.</i>

911
01:01:14,455 --> 01:01:16,013
<i>Ready on the left.</i>

912
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,405
<i>Firing line is ready.</i>

913
01:01:18,615 --> 01:01:20,606
<i>Shooters, prepare to fire!</i>

914
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:22,414
<i>Fire!</i>

915
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:37,250
<i>Cease fire! Clear your weapons!</i>

916
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:40,333
- Weapon clear, Barnes?
- All clear, Bozz.

917
01:01:44,015 --> 01:01:46,893
- The fuck you doing, Wilson?
- Killing me a Cong.

918
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:49,925
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

919
01:01:50,135 --> 01:01:51,124
Unload that weapon!

920
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,166
Head or the body, Bozz?
You choose!

921
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:54,774
Unload that fucking weapon!

922
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:59,333
- Head or the body?
- Damn it, unload that piece!

923
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:02,248
- Fuck you, Bozz.
- Unload that weapon!

924
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:03,365
Fuck you, Bozz!

925
01:02:25,215 --> 01:02:26,409
It's jammed.

926
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:29,370
Did you see that? Did you see that?

927
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:42,805
Looks like a misfeed jammed it.

928
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,809
Well, you are one lucky dick, Bozz.

929
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,768
It would've killed you
and the three people next to you.

930
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:51,887
- Hope you're not too disappointed.
- What do you want to do?

931
01:02:52,095 --> 01:02:55,974
How about get Wilson as far
the fuck away as possible, sir?

932
01:02:57,655 --> 01:03:00,806
Well, you have the right to
press for a court-martial.

933
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:04,364
Otherwise, you can let us
handle it our way.

934
01:03:04,575 --> 01:03:06,850
I'd personally prefer that option.

935
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:10,445
- Consider it a personal favor to me.
- Get Wilson out, sir.

936
01:03:10,775 --> 01:03:13,573
I don't recall telling you
to open your stinkhole.

937
01:03:13,775 --> 01:03:17,006
He's right, sir. Wilson
shouldn't be in the Army.

938
01:03:17,215 --> 01:03:19,126
Even if he did try to kill somebody.

939
01:03:20,015 --> 01:03:22,404
You and I need to exchange some ideas.

940
01:03:22,655 --> 01:03:24,088
That doesn't solve our problem.

941
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:27,810
We need to get him out now
or we'll file for a court-martial.

942
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,249
Paxton, you're dismissed.

943
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:31,803
Yes, sir.

944
01:03:41,975 --> 01:03:43,328
He's learning.

945
01:03:44,455 --> 01:03:48,209
Bozz, do you think the Army's never
seen pissants like you before?

946
01:03:49,255 --> 01:03:52,053
I know you think you're some
big swinging-dick hero.

947
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:54,450
I know a lot of the men think so too.

948
01:03:54,655 --> 01:03:58,250
But I know you for what you are.
You are a coward.

949
01:03:58,455 --> 01:04:02,414
You're a born leader and you're afraid
to take any real responsibility!

950
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:05,613
That's why you dropped out of school,
why you drop out of everything!

951
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:07,328
You're pissing your life away!

952
01:04:07,535 --> 01:04:09,173
I don't need the fucking Army...

953
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,843
...and I don't need the war
to tell me that, sir!

954
01:04:12,455 --> 01:04:13,683
Get on your feet, soldier.

955
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:16,213
Attention!

956
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:21,450
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.

957
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:24,806
I don't want you drummed out
on some bad conduct discharge.

958
01:04:26,055 --> 01:04:29,411
I want you exactly where you are.

959
01:04:30,055 --> 01:04:33,206
And we'll just naturally chew you up.

960
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:40,491
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.

961
01:05:08,495 --> 01:05:10,565
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.

962
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:12,806
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

963
01:05:13,055 --> 01:05:15,649
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- You shut the fuck up.

964
01:05:15,895 --> 01:05:17,772
- Guys, relax.
- I ain't starting.

965
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:20,131
You already got your ass beat once.

966
01:05:20,335 --> 01:05:24,089
- Just watch your back in Tigerland.
- I'll do that.

967
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:28,526
I guess I'm supposed to joke
about how I owe you my life.

968
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:31,613
- He almost killed you.
- You jealous?

969
01:05:31,855 --> 01:05:33,925
You wanted to know what it was like.

970
01:05:34,135 --> 01:05:35,363
What what was like?

971
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:38,175
The great lesson
of being close to death.

972
01:05:38,415 --> 01:05:39,768
Know what I know?

973
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:41,926
Same thing you know.

974
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:43,933
We're in a real bad way.

975
01:06:05,175 --> 01:06:06,733
Fuck.

976
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:09,973
Real bad way.

977
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:12,445
All right! Let's go! Move it!

978
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:13,923
Come on! Let's go!

979
01:06:14,175 --> 01:06:16,405
- Come on! Move! Move!
- Move your ass!

980
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:18,532
Come on, fat boy! Move your ass!

981
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:20,527
Let's go, soldier!

982
01:06:25,975 --> 01:06:27,533
Let's go! Let's go!

983
01:06:31,775 --> 01:06:33,049
<i>Welcome to Tigerland!</i>

984
01:06:33,295 --> 01:06:36,173
<i>Your final training</i>
<i>before you're shipped overseas!</i>

985
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:39,327
<i>Here, everything's done</i>
<i>exactly as it is over there.</i>

986
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:42,003
<i>You will search and destroy,</i>
<i>hunt and kill!</i>

987
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:45,406
<i>You'll move by chopper to secure</i>
<i>any area deemed necessary.</i>

988
01:06:45,655 --> 01:06:47,566
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.

989
01:06:47,815 --> 01:06:50,329
Minor mistakes
will pay back major punishment.

990
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:52,844
Maybe you've heard
we've lost this war.

991
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:55,973
Or we've lost the support
of people here at home.

992
01:06:56,215 --> 01:06:58,171
It's too late to
ask those questions.

993
01:06:58,495 --> 01:07:00,213
You're not back on the block.

994
01:07:00,455 --> 01:07:02,969
You're alive in a year,
we'll talk about it.

995
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:04,648
When you arrive in Nam...

996
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,807
...it's important to get acclimated
as quickly as you can.

997
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:10,011
Remember to think.

998
01:07:10,215 --> 01:07:12,251
- You understand me?
- Yes, sergeant!

999
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:17,330
What matters now is sharpening your
ability to find and destroy the enemy.

1000
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,247
Practice how to stay alive.

1001
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:22,771
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.

1002
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,769
<i>You're thinking you'll</i>
<i>go somewhere safe.</i>

1003
01:07:26,015 --> 01:07:27,164
<i>You'll luck out.</i>

1004
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:30,532
<i>Tigerland is where</i>
<i>you stop bullshitting yourself.</i>

1005
01:07:30,775 --> 01:07:34,450
Sarge, you got any advice
on how to stay alive in Vietnam?

1006
01:07:34,695 --> 01:07:37,334
- I do, private. Don't go.
- Right on, right on.

1007
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:39,930
My friend here wants the experience.

1008
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:41,927
Says he ain't scared.

1009
01:07:42,215 --> 01:07:43,933
Well, good luck.

1010
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:47,650
If you ask me, I'll stick
with the smart and the scared.

1011
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:52,650
You'll be under the care of NCOs
and officers who were in combat.

1012
01:07:52,895 --> 01:07:54,408
Listen to them.

1013
01:07:54,655 --> 01:07:57,727
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.

1014
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:00,653
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.

1015
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,772
I've done two tours in Vietnam.

1016
01:08:03,015 --> 01:08:05,529
My first in '67 with the 101 st.

1017
01:08:05,975 --> 01:08:08,648
<i>I just completed my second with MAC-V.</i>

1018
01:08:08,895 --> 01:08:11,568
<i>I only have two words</i>
<i>of advice for you.</i>

1019
01:08:11,815 --> 01:08:13,487
<i>And those are to listen...</i>

1020
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:15,129
<i>... and to learn.</i>

1021
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:18,365
<i>All right, let's saddle up.</i>

1022
01:08:19,215 --> 01:08:21,171
<i>Let's go! Let's saddle up!</i>

1023
01:08:21,415 --> 01:08:22,928
<i>Let's go, goddamn it!</i>

1024
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,327
Get down!

1025
01:08:28,535 --> 01:08:30,924
Good job, Paxton. Good job.

1026
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:32,733
Good job, Johnson.

1027
01:08:32,935 --> 01:08:33,924
All right.

1028
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,006
Get your ass behind that tree!

1029
01:08:36,215 --> 01:08:39,924
Fantastic. You guys move
like fucking soldiers!

1030
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:42,326
Get your ass down!

1031
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,933
Ryan, get your ass down!

1032
01:08:45,175 --> 01:08:47,245
Go! Move! Move!

1033
01:08:47,495 --> 01:08:49,929
Bozz, keep that barrel
out of the dirt!

1034
01:08:50,135 --> 01:08:51,329
Move, move, move!

1035
01:08:51,535 --> 01:08:53,730
Paxton, why are you slowing up?

1036
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:55,334
Get your ass down!

1037
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:57,812
You are the weak link!

1038
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,450
This is not the time to slow up.

1039
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:02,447
Adapt! Overcome!

1040
01:09:02,695 --> 01:09:04,287
Move! Get in there!

1041
01:09:05,615 --> 01:09:06,604
You good?

1042
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:08,573
Why were you slow, Paxton?

1043
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:11,534
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine, sergeant.

1044
01:09:22,295 --> 01:09:23,933
Diagonal, Private Barnes.

1045
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:27,008
- So you don't chop your knee off.
- Yes, sergeant.

1046
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,133
Go ahead, Paxton.
I gotta take a piss.

1047
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:37,927
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1048
01:10:33,815 --> 01:10:36,727
"Jim Paxton
on personal guide to pain."

1049
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:42,809
Get that fucking torch out of my face
and put that cigarette out.

1050
01:10:43,015 --> 01:10:46,007
You might as well
hang a big neon sign that says:

1051
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:48,325
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here."

1052
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:51,333
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.

1053
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:53,531
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

1054
01:10:53,735 --> 01:10:56,533
- Good.
- I'm still alive, sergeant.

1055
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:59,932
- What did you say?
- I said, I'm still alive.

1056
01:11:00,415 --> 01:11:03,327
I miraculously survived the attack.

1057
01:11:03,695 --> 01:11:05,526
- You didn't get hit?
- No.

1058
01:11:05,735 --> 01:11:07,054
Are your friends alive?

1059
01:11:07,295 --> 01:11:10,128
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.

1060
01:11:10,455 --> 01:11:13,765
If you're gonna make up a story,
make up a happy one.

1061
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:16,725
I ain't making anything up, son.

1062
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:23,045
And in Vietnam there are no
happy fucking stories.

1063
01:11:29,575 --> 01:11:32,373
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan...

1064
01:11:32,615 --> 01:11:35,527
...that I went to AIT with.

1065
01:11:37,415 --> 01:11:41,124
In '67, when the call came,
we got sent off to Nam.

1066
01:11:41,695 --> 01:11:46,132
We had only been in country
a few days. We was green as grass.

1067
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:51,334
We were in a two-man listening post,
talking just like we are here.

1068
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:54,125
Kelly lit up a cigarette.

1069
01:11:54,975 --> 01:11:57,569
One minute we're naming
his unborn child...

1070
01:11:57,815 --> 01:12:01,285
...and the next second
his brains were in my lap.

1071
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:16,365
The sniper zeroed in
on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.

1072
01:12:20,815 --> 01:12:24,330
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.

1073
01:12:25,415 --> 01:12:28,930
Respect for your superiors
and what they're trying to teach you.

1074
01:12:30,175 --> 01:12:33,326
Respect for yourselves and your unit.

1075
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,931
And most important...

1076
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:40,127
...respect the enemy.

1077
01:12:45,575 --> 01:12:47,725
You have 42 minutes...

1078
01:12:47,975 --> 01:12:50,535
...then the squad's on patrol.

1079
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:07,733
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese
village we could create for you...

1080
01:13:07,975 --> 01:13:09,169
...here on the base!

1081
01:13:09,415 --> 01:13:13,249
Now, listen. You're all gooks,
so nobody speaks English.

1082
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:17,044
Anybody asks you a question
in English, you answer, "No bic."

1083
01:13:17,295 --> 01:13:20,731
It means, "I don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.

1084
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:24,565
Good. Private Bozz, you are
the only man that speaks English.

1085
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:29,650
Speak only to the man who identifies
himself as interpreter. Understood?

1086
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,573
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Private Paxton.

1087
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:33,248
You are the Vietcong.

1088
01:13:33,495 --> 01:13:37,932
They come through, their objective
is to find the VC sympathizer.

1089
01:13:38,135 --> 01:13:40,569
In other words, you, Private Paxton.

1090
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:42,726
They have five minutes.

1091
01:13:42,935 --> 01:13:45,927
You tell them nothing.

1092
01:13:46,415 --> 01:13:47,973
I warn you, they're beat up.

1093
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,046
They've been awake three nights.

1094
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:51,774
<i>Forced marched all day.</i>

1095
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:55,974
<i>They fuck this up,</i>
<i>they'll march another six miles.</i>

1096
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:57,369
<i>One other thing:</i>

1097
01:13:57,615 --> 01:14:01,324
<i>They find out</i>
<i>which one of you is VC...</i>

1098
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:04,135
<i>... and you'll be the ones</i>
<i>out in the boonies...</i>

1099
01:14:04,335 --> 01:14:07,611
<i>... on no sleep, forced marching</i>
<i>for the next two nights.</i>

1100
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:08,804
<i>Understood?</i>

1101
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:10,966
- Yes, sergeant.
- Let's get to work.

1102
01:14:11,215 --> 01:14:13,775
Private Bozz, Paxton. Over here.

1103
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:17,371
Lets see...
Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.

1104
01:14:17,615 --> 01:14:19,731
Make it as realistic as possible.

1105
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:22,130
This is not a fucking joke.

1106
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:24,770
I like this.
It's like a war theme park.

1107
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:27,575
I'm so tired. I'm gonna pass out.

1108
01:14:38,535 --> 01:14:40,127
Hey, here they come.

1109
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,728
Shit.

1110
01:14:46,975 --> 01:14:48,169
It's Wilson.

1111
01:14:49,295 --> 01:14:50,523
What?

1112
01:14:50,735 --> 01:14:54,205
- I thought we got him out.
- There's a war going on.

1113
01:14:54,415 --> 01:14:56,724
Plenty of room
for psychopathic killers.

1114
01:14:56,935 --> 01:14:59,403
Let's move it.
We don't got much time.

1115
01:14:59,655 --> 01:15:01,930
We gotta find the VC.

1116
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,727
Fuck me.

1117
01:15:10,615 --> 01:15:11,843
VC?

1118
01:15:13,415 --> 01:15:15,531
Get your ass on the ground!

1119
01:15:19,735 --> 01:15:21,532
Get on the fucking ground!

1120
01:15:22,095 --> 01:15:23,528
You VC?

1121
01:15:24,575 --> 01:15:25,928
You VC?

1122
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:28,524
How'd that feel?

1123
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:32,927
Need an interpreter?
I'm the only one that speaks English.

1124
01:15:35,815 --> 01:15:37,487
How does that feel, Paxton?

1125
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:45,731
What are you gonna write about now?

1126
01:15:50,095 --> 01:15:52,211
What are you writing in your journal?

1127
01:15:58,055 --> 01:15:59,374
Don't fucking move!

1128
01:16:01,215 --> 01:16:03,524
Let go of him, goddamn it!

1129
01:16:10,015 --> 01:16:13,325
- You're in charge! On your feet!
- Yes, sergeant.

1130
01:16:13,815 --> 01:16:16,045
Where is your weapon, soldier?

1131
01:16:16,295 --> 01:16:17,523
There it is.

1132
01:16:17,775 --> 01:16:20,926
Why didn't you secure the area,
Private Wilson?

1133
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:24,851
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control!

1134
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,528
Yes, sergeant.

1135
01:16:27,535 --> 01:16:29,765
Did you find any VC?

1136
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:33,724
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.

1137
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:35,323
Come here.

1138
01:16:37,255 --> 01:16:41,373
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.

1139
01:16:41,575 --> 01:16:43,725
Get out of here! Let's go. Move!

1140
01:16:43,935 --> 01:16:46,051
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Is that right?

1141
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,170
- You gonna kill me again?
- I'll kill you.

1142
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:51,247
Get your hands off him!

1143
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:54,253
You want to go?

1144
01:16:54,495 --> 01:16:56,963
Get the fuck out of here!

1145
01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:03,125
- Get the fuck out!
- I'll break your neck!

1146
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,804
- Let's move!
- Get the fuck out of here!

1147
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,647
Somebody grab my steel pot.

1148
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:09,533
Get out of here.

1149
01:17:09,855 --> 01:17:11,766
- How you doing?
- Shit.

1150
01:17:12,015 --> 01:17:13,368
Is he all right?

1151
01:17:13,615 --> 01:17:14,934
No, he's not all right.

1152
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:17,325
Take your time.

1153
01:18:20,255 --> 01:18:22,246
- You going?
- I can't take you with me.

1154
01:18:22,495 --> 01:18:24,850
Not me. Paxton. He's hurting.

1155
01:18:25,095 --> 01:18:26,130
He signed up.

1156
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:27,933
And you judged him for it.

1157
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:31,093
You even made me feel guilty
and I was drafted.

1158
01:18:34,935 --> 01:18:37,529
You saw what Wilson did to him today.

1159
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,734
He's broken down.

1160
01:18:40,935 --> 01:18:43,608
And the Army didn't do
all the breaking. Take him.

1161
01:18:43,855 --> 01:18:46,813
It's not my fault if he
just realized what he did.

1162
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,330
I only got time for my sad story.

1163
01:18:49,575 --> 01:18:51,930
- Take him with you.
- Fuck off!

1164
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:54,735
Wilson's gonna take
his hate out on somebody.

1165
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:59,526
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.

1166
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:01,811
Johnson, I like you, but fuck off.

1167
01:19:02,935 --> 01:19:05,324
Yeah, well,
I ain't standing in your way.

1168
01:19:58,695 --> 01:20:00,492
Rise and shine, gentlemen!

1169
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,572
Let's go, gentlemen! Roll
em!

1170
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,534
Let's go! Move! Get on your feet!

1171
01:20:05,735 --> 01:20:10,126
I know you're tired, but you'll be
doing a lot of this in the next year!

1172
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:11,728
If you're not...

1173
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:14,688
...then you're in a body bag.
- Where's Bozz?

1174
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:17,534
Waiting for a dust-off.

1175
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:20,529
Where is your squad leader?

1176
01:20:20,935 --> 01:20:22,573
Is this his weapon?

1177
01:20:22,815 --> 01:20:25,534
Does anybody know
where your squad leader is?

1178
01:20:25,775 --> 01:20:27,128
Where is he, Johnson?

1179
01:20:33,415 --> 01:20:36,691
- Where is your weapon, Private Bozz?
- Right here, sarge.

1180
01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:38,089
I know that.

1181
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:41,845
The next time you decide
to take a piss or a fucking shit...

1182
01:20:42,095 --> 01:20:44,131
...you make sure you have your weapon.

1183
01:20:44,335 --> 01:20:47,532
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it?

1184
01:20:47,735 --> 01:20:51,171
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think I'd need it.

1185
01:20:51,415 --> 01:20:52,768
Very funny.

1186
01:20:53,575 --> 01:20:55,167
You take point.

1187
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:59,529
Paxton, take slack. Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.

1188
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:00,929
Listen up.

1189
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:04,531
You'll square off
against the boys from yesterday.

1190
01:21:04,775 --> 01:21:06,413
They may have booby traps.

1191
01:21:06,815 --> 01:21:09,045
They may have forward observers
watching.

1192
01:21:09,295 --> 01:21:12,367
They may do all manner of shit
that you don't know.

1193
01:21:12,615 --> 01:21:17,325
That's why you will keep
your eyes open and your mouths shut.

1194
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:20,732
- Is that fucking understood?
- Yes, sarge.

1195
01:21:22,655 --> 01:21:23,770
Let's move out.

1196
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:29,924
- Welcome back.
- You owe me 150 bucks.

1197
01:21:34,175 --> 01:21:36,530
Hurry up, Paxton. Let's go.

1198
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:06,565
Dixie, dixie, my 12.

1199
01:22:06,815 --> 01:22:08,214
Dixie, my 12.

1200
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:53,524
Move it! Come on!

1201
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:43,814
You okay?

1202
01:24:45,695 --> 01:24:49,768
Fuck, Bozz. Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked?

1203
01:24:50,015 --> 01:24:52,404
Relax. You'll be fine.

1204
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:54,327
You'll be fine.

1205
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:32,731
Wilson, what the hell are you doing?
That's live ammo.

1206
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:28,726
Ambush! 12:00!

1207
01:26:35,135 --> 01:26:36,329
Live ammo!

1208
01:26:39,215 --> 01:26:41,683
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1209
01:27:03,175 --> 01:27:04,369
Private Wilson!

1210
01:27:04,895 --> 01:27:06,692
Private-fucking-Wilson!

1211
01:27:06,975 --> 01:27:09,409
Private Wilson, look at me, goddamn it!

1212
01:27:09,775 --> 01:27:11,731
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1213
01:27:13,815 --> 01:27:14,804
Look at me.

1214
01:27:15,055 --> 01:27:17,205
You will place your weapon on safe!

1215
01:27:17,615 --> 01:27:20,732
You will raise your weapon
above your fucking head...

1216
01:27:20,975 --> 01:27:23,284
...or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

1217
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:26,254
Oh, Jesus!

1218
01:27:26,815 --> 01:27:28,134
Do it!

1219
01:27:31,095 --> 01:27:32,847
On your fucking knees, now!

1220
01:27:33,095 --> 01:27:34,608
Get on your fucking knees!

1221
01:27:35,575 --> 01:27:39,090
You will be court-martialed!
Do you fucking hear me?

1222
01:27:42,695 --> 01:27:44,765
- What happened?
- An accident. My fault.

1223
01:27:46,215 --> 01:27:47,534
Let me look.

1224
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,534
Get him up.

1225
01:28:04,895 --> 01:28:06,931
Let me see the eye.

1226
01:29:10,815 --> 01:29:14,569
Let's go, move it!
This war is not gonna last forever!

1227
01:29:14,815 --> 01:29:17,170
Bozz, bus number three!

1228
01:29:17,415 --> 01:29:20,532
You don't want to miss this war!
Let's go!

1229
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:27,172
- Want to come along?
- I did, but you wouldn't let me.

1230
01:29:28,215 --> 01:29:29,330
How's your eye?

1231
01:29:30,935 --> 01:29:35,053
Got an injury bad enough to get out,
no permanent damage. Imagine that.

1232
01:29:35,255 --> 01:29:37,007
More corny wisdom for your book.

1233
01:29:37,255 --> 01:29:40,213
"In the country of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king."

1234
01:29:40,815 --> 01:29:43,534
Pretty fancy shooting, Tex.
Thank you.

1235
01:29:44,535 --> 01:29:47,652
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.

1236
01:29:48,135 --> 01:29:49,727
No, it wasn't.

1237
01:29:51,055 --> 01:29:53,091
Somebody had to take your place.

1238
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:56,849
Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.

1239
01:29:58,215 --> 01:29:59,887
Write me when you get there.

1240
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:02,367
This is it, man.

1241
01:30:02,615 --> 01:30:04,606
No more phony Army buddy crap.

1242
01:30:12,135 --> 01:30:13,727
Go home.

1243
01:30:14,215 --> 01:30:16,126
Live a long time.

1244
01:30:17,215 --> 01:30:19,331
Try not to be too much of an asshole.

1245
01:30:20,975 --> 01:30:23,535
I'm gonna write
a whole book about this.

1246
01:30:23,975 --> 01:30:25,567
Tell everyone about you.

1247
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:30,808
Sergeant Thomas...

1248
01:30:31,055 --> 01:30:33,125
...sorry for my misbehavior earlier.

1249
01:30:37,335 --> 01:30:38,529
Real sorry.

1250
01:30:48,575 --> 01:30:50,452
See you back here. Take care.

1251
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:52,168
- Watch your back.
- See you.

1252
01:30:52,415 --> 01:30:56,374
- I'll write a book about you, Bozz!
- No, you won't.

1253
01:30:56,615 --> 01:30:59,129
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.

1254
01:30:59,335 --> 01:31:01,769
Jesus! Bozz!

1255
01:31:02,335 --> 01:31:04,929
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book!

1256
01:31:06,175 --> 01:31:07,927
What are you doing? Shit!

1257
01:31:08,175 --> 01:31:10,325
Stop the bus!

1258
01:31:13,415 --> 01:31:15,167
What is this shit?

1259
01:31:26,575 --> 01:31:28,531
<i>I never saw Bozz again.</i>

1260
01:31:29,815 --> 01:31:32,204
<i>Some guys said he died in Nam...</i>

1261
01:31:32,495 --> 01:31:34,326
<i>... but he was never listed.</i>

1262
01:31:35,575 --> 01:31:38,135
<i>Some said he just</i>
<i>disappeared over there.</i>

1263
01:31:38,495 --> 01:31:41,567
<i>One guy called and said</i>
<i>he thought he saw him in Mexico...</i>

1264
01:31:41,815 --> 01:31:43,533
<i>... with a beautiful woman.</i>

1265
01:31:44,895 --> 01:31:46,533
<i>But knowing Bozz...</i>

1266
01:31:46,735 --> 01:31:49,932
<i>... he'd be pissed off</i>
<i>I was talking about him anyway.</i>
