1
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,512
My father said the Army
makes all men one.

2
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,265
But you never know which one.

3
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,143
He didn't know Roland Bozz.

4
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,440
Get up!

5
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,151
Get the fuck up! Come on.

6
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,280
Get your fucking low-life asses
out of bed!

7
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,829
You got 15 minutes
or you're gonna do pushups until l pass out.

8
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,166
Let's go. Let's go. Get up! Let's go!

9
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,336
Get your socks on and get outside,
you fucking pussies!

10
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,507
-Hurry up!
-Move!

11
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,176
-Ain't got all day.
-Move your ass, soldier.

12
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,779
Richard Nixon, drop the bomb

13
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,700
I don't wanna go to Nam

14
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,703
Next time won't be
no weekend in the stockade.

15
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,873
It'll be a full-scale
motherfucking court-martial.

16
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,545
Maybe a few years hard time in
Leavenworth. How's that fly, dipshit?

17
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,715
Discounting reception, basic training
corrective custody...

18
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:18,554
...been in the Army more than three
months. Most of it in the stockade.

19
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:31,066
Get on that fucking deuce!
Get up on that deuce, boy!

20
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,571
You don't need
no special invitation, son!

21
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,574
Do as l ask!
Hoist that Gl ass on that deuce!

22
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,910
Let's go. Get it done! Get it done!

23
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,255
Private Bozz, Roland. No middle initial.

24
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,090
You're going to infantry.

25
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,135
I bet my left nut
they bag and tag you in a week.

26
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,805
Any man tries that hard to get out
will never see home again.

27
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,808
I don't like the rehearsal,
so l'll skip the show.

28
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,561
Fuck you. Get on that deuce. Let's go!

29
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,162
Bozz.

30
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:30,667
I got a buddy in Charlie Company
says he knows a fellow by that name.

31
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,587
Says he's the biggest fuck-up
in the Army.

32
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:38,175
Clowning around and always acting
like fucking bozo.

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,138
Article 15, recycled through basic,
all kinds of goldbrick shit.

34
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,644
Sounds to me like that fellow's
no more than a goddamn coward.

35
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,355
Afraid of Tigerland, huh?

36
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,814
Should be scared.

37
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,359
They hump your ass until it falls off.

38
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,364
-l heard a guy from Bravo died there.
-No, man, that's a rumor.

39
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,493
You afraid of big old Tigerland,
Private Fuck-up?

40
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,956
Read this and tell me what happens.
I gotta get away from this guy.

41
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,127
Go for it, Bozz!

42
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
Private Bozz!

43
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,138
What the fuck?
Stop the goddamn truck!

44
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,353
Goddamn it!
What the fuck is your problem?

45
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,356
You stupid motherfucker!
You're nothing but a--

46
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,025
Get back in that truck, you little fuck!

47
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,153
The rest of you motherfuckers,
sit your asses down!

48
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,241
Good morning, gentlemen.

49
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,493
My name is Captain Saunders.

50
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,704
Commanding officer, Alpha Company.

51
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,998
Third advance infantry training brigade.

52
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,333
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,713
No matter where you did your basic,
either Fort Polk or elsewhere...

54
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,258
...rest assured that we train the
proudest, the toughest...

55
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,135
...the best-equipped soldiers.

56
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,514
This base is the largest supplier
of combat troops overseas.

57
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,517
So don't let any man here
start having any little...

58
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,854
...pasty fucking daydreams
about being anyplace else.

59
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,689
I shit you not, gentlemen.

60
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,775
You are headed for
a two-way firing range.

61
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,236
You will be sent to the war.

62
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,239
You will be here for
an eight-week training cycle.

63
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,242
After that, you will remain here
for a week more.

64
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,579
We will ship you to an outpost
10 miles from here...

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,250
...that is known throughout the Army
as the second worst place on earth.

66
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,877
Tigerland.

67
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,713
It is the stateside province
of Vietnam...

68
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,050
...and it is as close to the war
as we can make it.

69
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,136
Now, gentlemen,
it behooves you to learn...

70
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,764
...what little we can teach you here.

71
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,141
For if you do, then maybe...

72
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,601
...just maybe...

73
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,105
...you will return one day
to play stink-finger with Sally back home.

74
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,357
Let's get squared away.

75
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,985
Those of you not on detail
will have a pass for the weekend.

76
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,613
Training begins Monday at 0430.

77
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,784
From that time on, every
son of a bitch humps his own load.

78
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,800
-Sucky-sucky, baby?
-Oh, no, thank you.

79
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,194
There you go.

80
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,993
-You got a high sex drive.
-You're right.

81
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,370
Which line says that?

82
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,957
I'm no expert but it says
you're gonna have sex real soon.

83
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,669
-What about me?
-Sex for Sheri as well.

84
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,298
There you go.

85
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,884
-Did you read it?
-No, I didn't.

86
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,179
Me, neither. l keep it around
to piss everybody off.

87
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,472
Jim Paxton.

88
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,811
Let's not become friends.
You could die and I'd miss you too much.

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,312
Excuse me?

90
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,775
It's a joke. Forget it. Roland Bozz.

91
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,903
This here is Sheri and Claudia
or Claudia and Sheri.

92
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,572
Ladies, Jim Paxton.

93
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,658
-Pleased to make your acquaintance.
-Nice to meet you.

94
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,535
Charmed, I'm sure.

95
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,163
-Let me buy you ladies a drink.
-Right on.

96
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,831
Four, please.

97
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,459
-You girls from here?
-Born and bred. You?

98
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,211
-Upstate New York.
-New York.

99
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,214
How about you, Bozz?
Where are you from?

100
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,551
Texas, Jim. It's in the
Southwestern part of the United States.

101
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,847
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll double-check that
on the map. Thanks.

102
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,224
They came down hard on you
in company.

103
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,352
-l'm surprised they let you off base.
-They didn't.

104
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,564
-l'm confined to company air.
-Oh, you're AWOL?

105
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,733
Man, the children.

106
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,776
To peace on earth and a cure for cancer.

107
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,070
-Cheers.
-Amen.

108
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,240
Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.

109
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,411
Man, all l said was,
"To peace on earth and a cure for cancer."

110
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,289
-Who said it's a joke?
-You're doing a routine.

111
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,875
A funny soldier with two girls in a bar--

112
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,793
Man, l'm not doing any routine.

113
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,880
If you're gonna be an asshole about it,
fuck you.

114
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,592
Now, Jim, that's not the answer.

115
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,720
Oh, really, smart-ass? Then what is?

116
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,556
The answer is, I got a hotel room.

117
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,143
We're gonna take these ladies
and fuck till the war is over.

118
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,145
Okay.

119
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,800
Hello. This is fun.

120
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,636
Oh, really, really fun.

121
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,348
-lt's not bad for a couple grunts.
-Not bad for a couple grunts?

122
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,976
Who are you?
Sergeant Rock, Easy Company?

123
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,896
Who are you playing?
Absurd man in an absurd world?

124
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,649
You're playing a fool
fighting the system.

125
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,318
-There's a difference, Paxton.
-Really, what?

126
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,487
I'm a failed fool.

127
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,617
Yeah, you've got a rep.
I heard you're the biggest fool around.

128
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,035
Oh, well, thank you.

129
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,163
But that's it.
I'm still around when I should be out.

130
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,624
-And I'm gonna get out.
-Not me.

131
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,209
I enlisted.

132
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,378
-ls this some war shit again?
-Yes.

133
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,338
-l got the munchies.
-Me too.

134
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,175
I wish I hadn't heard you say that.
I was starting to like you.

135
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,512
You know, I thought a lot about it, Bozz.

136
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,222
I don't like the war.

137
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,892
Maybe I'm even against it.
But l'm not against my country.

138
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,812
Does this place have room service?
Where's the phone?

139
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,024
That's some fancy
political thinking, professor.

140
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,360
Let me give you some advice.
Figure out a way to go.

141
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,196
-Get out, singing while you go.
-Guys, help us.

142
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,034
-We're hungry, you know?
-Me too, man.

143
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,996
You know, that's not all, man.
It's not just political.

144
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,291
I want to go.
I want to see what it's like.

145
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,753
I want the experience.
I'm taking notes on everything.

146
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,089
Shut up. l'm taking notes
on everything. One day--

147
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,344
One day l'll write something
like James Jones or Hemingway.

148
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,887
What will you write?

149
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,223
That war is hell, men are brave,
that kind of petrified crap?

150
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,061
So you've popped my fucking balloon.
Jesus Christ, Bozz.

151
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,605
I know a 24-hour place
on Bourbon Street.

152
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,368
The girls are gone.

153
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,913
Yes, they are.

154
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,083
Okay.

155
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,388
Hey, how you doing?

156
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,265
Keep your head down.

157
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,435
Fucking AWOL piece of shit,
son of a bitch.

158
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,938
That bag of shit of yours in the dirt.

159
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,775
Private Bozz is demonstrating
the proper way to dig a hole under fire.

160
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,070
Under fire, you will fall
to the earth and lie flat.

161
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,907
Under fire, you will ask God
to remove your buttons...

162
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,951
...to get closer to the ground.

163
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,746
Under fire you will dig a hole
with your teeth if you have to.

164
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,289
Open your mouth.

165
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,792
Now, shitbird.

166
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,168
Do it! Eat dirt!

167
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,423
I don't hear you. "Yes, sergeant."

168
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,093
-l'm still not hearing you.
-You wear a dress, sergeant?

169
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,642
-What did you say, you piece of crap?
-Go kiss my ass, sergeant!

170
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,479
You little finger-fucking cocksucker.

171
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,524
I will make you push Fort Polk
into the sea!

172
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,026
Yes, sir, I already have a man in mind.

173
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,445
Thank you.

174
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,363
Eat dirt. Do it!

175
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,031
Do it! Eat dirt!

176
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,035
-Eat it!
-All right, sergeant, that's enough.

177
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,871
Get these men moving.

178
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,291
Move it! You heard the man.

179
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,626
Let's move it! Get going!

180
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,381
Miter, you're the new platoon guide,
the 2nd Platoon.

181
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,009
Get Bozz in line. lf it don't happen...

182
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,179
...even Jesus won't be able
to save you, understand?

183
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,390
-Yes, sergeant.
-Have these men fall in and fall out.

184
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,559
Platoon, fall in.

185
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,146
Fall out to your weapons.

186
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:03,865
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz, Bozz!

187
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,535
What is wrong with you, private?
Move your ass, son.

188
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,828
Let's go.

189
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,079
Move it!

190
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,873
-Bozz.
-Let's go!

191
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,377
Get that bag of shit in the dirt.

192
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,760
That's mine.

193
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,398
On my mind

194
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,984
I'm still trying to find

195
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,238
I wanna take her home to my mama

196
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,240
Platoon, listen up.

197
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,243
Platoon, we got a heavy day tomorrow.

198
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,869
Everybody hit the racks.

199
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,246
Lights out.

200
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,250
-Lights out.
-You like being in control, don't you, boy?

201
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,586
I ain't took no shower. l gotta take one.

202
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,175
God, shut up.

203
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:08,263
I don't fuck with you when
you're talking, so don't fuck with me.

204
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,975
Sergeant Thomas.

205
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,770
Private Cantwell reporting
to the weapon shed as ordered.

206
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,606
Sergeant Thomas?

207
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,645
Glad you waited up for me, Dad.

208
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,981
I think everybody did, Bozz.

209
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,444
This the scene where the troublemaker
gets beaten by his buddies?

210
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,195
Somebody got beaten.

211
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,948
Cantwell.

212
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,289
Jesus.

213
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,375
-What happened?
-l think it was Sergeant Thomas.

214
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,668
Damn it.

215
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,545
Anybody report it?

216
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,007
Why? It's not gonna put
his face back together.

217
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,509
He was trying to fuck around like you.

218
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,180
I'm sorry this happened to you.

219
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,391
There ain't gonna be
no more clowning from you.

220
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,061
You hear? Go wash up and hit the rack.

221
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,856
Shut your cake-hole, Miter.
You're giving Cantwell a headache.

222
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,694
I'm telling you, that's the same
as getting an order from the sergeant.

223
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,155
Don't make me put you on report.

224
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,533
Give it a rest.
It's been a hard day for all of us.

225
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,912
Don't you give me a hard time, Paxton.
You're okay.

226
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,998
You'll be a good soldier,
but this individual--

227
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,711
He wants to be a bumblefuck.
He wants to laugh at everything we do.

228
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,672
He'll hurt this platoon.

229
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,715
What are you, 20 years old?

230
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,928
Just because you wear sergeant stripes
don't mean you ain't gonna die.

231
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,597
Where you going that we ain't, Bozz?

232
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,352
You best start to soldiering, boy,
or you're coming home in a rubber sack.

233
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,343
Fuck.

234
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,105
Just wanted you to know,
I've taken a great dislike to you.

235
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,108
-ls there anything else, Wilson?
-No.

236
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,277
I don't reckon there is.

237
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,268
I'm gonna tell you something.
This is the last chance you'll get to hear it.

238
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,854
You can't kill a dink with a ricochet.

239
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,191
Oh, this is all about killing people?
Well, shit.

240
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,953
So you can shoot when you want to.

241
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,622
When I want to.

242
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,957
Idea of killing dinks excite you?

243
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,669
Cease fire. Cease fire.

244
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,547
Get your targets, scumbags.

245
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,509
All clear.

246
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,889
You can't hit your targets,
there'll be hell to pay.

247
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,727
Shit, I do believe that's
Cantwell's target there, boys.

248
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,398
-Not a single bullet hole in it.
-Shut your cracker face, Wilson.

249
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,026
Sgt. Thomas'll chew my ass for chow.

250
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,904
You ain't gonna be making
no phone calls home soon.

251
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,826
You gonna be busy. All asses and elbows,
picking up ciggie butts.

252
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,870
Wilson, you're a one-man campaign
to make the world more ugly.

253
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,707
-l ain't afraid of you, Bozz.
-Yes, you are, Wilson.

254
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,878
-You're just too stupid to realize it.
-Okay then, Sunday school.

255
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,549
You're such a goddamn saint,
give Cantwell your target.

256
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,844
-l'll give him yours.
-You take that and l'll--

257
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,389
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
is the purpose of this clusterfuck?

258
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,559
-Wilson switched targets with Cantwell.
-That's true. I saw him.

259
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,227
-That's bullshit.
-Lie down.

260
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,354
-Permission to--
-Now, shitbird!

261
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,939
Yes, sergeant.

262
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,110
You know why this man's on the ground?
Because he's dead!

263
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,237
He's dead.

264
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,240
And you can't bury him.
Do you know why?

265
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,701
-Why, sarge?
-Because you're dead too!

266
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,744
You're all dead...

267
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,540
...because you don't know how
to fire weapons on semi-automatic.

268
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,418
Or how to hit Charlie with short bursts...

269
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,296
...so your goddamn barrels
don't overheat.

270
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,924
And because this shitbag
can't hit his fucking target.

271
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,593
Any questions?

272
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,720
-No, sergeant.
-l got a question.

273
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,764
If l'm dead, how come
I can ask you a question?

274
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,935
I know exactly what you're doing,
you pissant fairy.

275
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,979
I want you...

276
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,275
...and your two girlfriends here...

277
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,486
...to report to the mess sergeant
after chow tonight.

278
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,447
Get up, Lazarus.

279
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,449
You're resurrected.

280
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,827
Get up.

281
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,705
Cantwell.

282
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,474
You're getting a lot less funny, Bozz.

283
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,102
There's some big old moon shining down.

284
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,189
Reminds you what this world is all about.

285
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,026
-What, peeling potatoes?
-lt's good you talk so slow, Cantwell.

286
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,320
Paxton there is taking notes.

287
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,322
Maybe he'll put you in a book.

288
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,825
Another one of his hokey characters:
the bumpkin saint.

289
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,162
I don't rightly know
what you're talking about.

290
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,039
I don't read much.

291
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,962
Never got past sixth grade.

292
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,298
Got married. Got a wife back home.

293
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,467
Poor little girl.

294
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,469
She has seizures.

295
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,179
These spells, you know?

296
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,349
Four children gotta go
without a mama now and again.

297
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,186
Jesus, Cantwell, when did you get married?
When you were 12?

298
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,689
Hell, no.

299
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,023
I was 15.

300
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,653
We had two together.
She had two previous.

301
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,531
I'm 19, but she's a might older.
She's 28.

302
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,576
I got a little boy who's 1
and a little girl who's 2.

303
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,079
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

304
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,586
Don't it strike you how
it's the same moon shining?

305
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,339
And it's shining down on us here...

306
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,884
...and shining down on that little girl
who's my wife.

307
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,012
It's the same moon...

308
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,431
...that'll be shining
when they send us to war.

309
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,685
Same moon that's shining down on
those boys getting shot.

310
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,396
Don't it strike you what it means?

311
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,858
How each of us is a bit of everything.

312
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,028
And everything is shit.

313
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,073
I know that back home...

314
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,909
...preacher be talking about
right and wrong.

315
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,621
About the Lord and God and Jesus.

316
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,373
But you know...

317
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,418
...if the Lord or God or Jesus...

318
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,920
...be standing here right now...

319
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,131
...he'd say, "Cantwell...

320
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,136
...you forget about
all these promises.

321
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,389
You forget about what all anybody say.

322
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,560
And you forget about all them
big Sunday fancy ideas.

323
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,604
Even what we tell you.

324
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,399
You look up there."

325
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,779
Did you ever see such a moon?

326
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,949
Goddamn it, Cantwell.

327
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,790
Shit.

328
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,501
Fuck, l don't even know you, man.

329
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,462
You sitting there
telling your fucking story.

330
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,676
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about?

331
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:12,098
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.

332
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,810
You shouldn't even be in this army.

333
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,189
You're just too stupid
to get yourself out.

334
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,316
I told them my predicament.

335
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,611
They said, "Wait till you get
to the war, complain there."

336
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,530
And you bought that?

337
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,156
The man said it.

338
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,618
I know Army regulations
the way prisoners know the law.

339
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,787
You're a hardship discharge, man.

340
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,335
Okay. Look, I'll get you out of the Army.

341
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,171
What are you saying?
You don't give a rat's ass about him.

342
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,675
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.

343
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,511
Just peel some
fucking potatoes or something.

344
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,975
-One, two, three.
-Two.

345
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,018
-One, two, three.
-Three.

346
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,354
-One, two, three.
-Four.

347
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,023
-One, two, three.
-Five.

348
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,872
Who put you up to this, son?

349
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,874
Nobody, sir.

350
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,543
-l know my rights.
-No, you don't.

351
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,755
Your case won't be reviewed until
after you're overseas. Dismissed.

352
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,844
No, sir. l don't believe that's correct.

353
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:35,764
And l believe if you don't allow me
to see a J.A.G. officer, sir...

354
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,851
...then under the uniform code
of military justice...

355
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,937
...l can file a complaint
with the inspector general.

356
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,564
And nobody can keep me.

357
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,733
Jesus Christ.

358
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,361
When did "My country, right or wrong"
turn into "Fuck this"?

359
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,032
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.

360
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,577
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.

361
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,246
I read it. In a book.

362
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,462
You read it? In a book?

363
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,631
Yes, sir.

364
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,925
How far did you get in school?

365
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,094
Almost sixth grade, sir.

366
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,933
I guess they study law early
where you come from.

367
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,395
Sir, if I may speak frankly.

368
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,482
You underestimate the damage
an individual like Bozz can do.

369
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,275
He's bad for the Army, sir.

370
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,613
Haven't you heard? Everything's bad
for the Army these days. Even war.

371
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:37,451
Now drive your knee through his face.
Shove his brain through his ear. Good!

372
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,119
Thank you, sir.

373
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,456
What's your solution?
Shit-can him out of the Army?

374
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,959
Of course not. That's what he wants.

375
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,044
-Exactly.
-Court-martial him.

376
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,129
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.

377
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,924
Sergeant, you know we won't
court-martial him.

378
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,968
It'll cost beaucoup dollars...

379
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,180
...and Battalion will ask why l can't
keep one asshole trainee in line.

380
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,267
Five weeks from now, he'll be in the war.

381
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,937
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad. Sure as shit.

382
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,607
Maybe not. Got Cantwell out. Two
of the guys of the last squad he was in.

383
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:13,362
Every son-of-a-bitch J.A.G. head-shrinking
bleeding-heart pissed downstream on us.

384
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,655
That's Bozz, sir.

385
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,366
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.

386
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,785
Sergeant, we are losing a war.

387
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,122
The whole goddamn Army is falling apart.

388
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,167
You want me to fiddle-fuck around
with one smart-ass barracks lawyer?

389
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,336
I think he's something more, sir.

390
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,132
-ls that all, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

391
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,179
What the hell you doing, soldier?!
Goddamn it, Bozz!

392
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,850
You're supposed to strangle him,
not become his fuck buddy!

393
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,393
Yes, sergeant.

394
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,591
Pussy-fucking-coward.

395
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,554
What the fuck you looking at,
you bunch of no-nut sad sacks?

396
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,349
Get your little pussies back to work!

397
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,939
You try that again,
you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.

398
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,655
Now get those little pussies
back to work...

399
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,075
...you bunch of sad sack,
no-nut fuck-ups!

400
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,244
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.

401
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,415
He's two steps from the poorhouse
with a wife in the nuthouse. l envy him.

402
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,084
You saved his life.

403
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,253
Shit, sometimes when we talk,
my stomach hurts.

404
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,382
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.

405
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,717
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.

406
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,220
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.

407
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,931
Know what would settle your ass?
A blanket party.

408
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,684
Put a blanket over you,
hit you with a rock.

409
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,728
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.

410
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,272
-Both of you can walk back--
-You, Paxton...

411
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,441
...you think you so damn smart.

412
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,611
I hear Northern boys
are the first to go in Vietnam.

413
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,489
Yeah, but at least
we can find it on a map.

414
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,950
Real fucking funny, Pax.

415
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,120
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.

416
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,165
Ain't nobody gonna die? Shit, Miter,
you're one damn dumb cracker.

417
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,961
When you go home, they'll call you
"Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker."

418
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,839
-That any better?
-You watch yourself, mister.

419
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,508
I still got these stripes. Acting sarge.

420
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,886
You're pretty chicken, paint
a big old yellow stripe down your back.

421
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,141
-l ain't seen a dink that can take my legs.
-Jesus, Wilson, you're a dumb fuck.

422
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,852
Them motherfuckers
killed the Chinese ass...

423
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,563
...kicked the French's ass.
They're gonna kick ours.

424
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:57,693
-Who are you? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard"?
-My brother was there in '68.

425
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,319
Don't make you no hero.

426
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,822
You know what your problem is, Wilson?

427
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,199
You need to listen for the pop.

428
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,368
What's "the pop," Johnson?

429
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:13,500
The sound you'll make when your head
comes out of your ass for the first time.

430
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,838
Damn, Johnson,
I know you a damn coward.

431
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,382
Now I believe you a damn communist.

432
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,178
Maybe a damn faggot alongside
being a goddamn nigger.

433
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,847
-Oh, hell no!
-Ain't this some shit.

434
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,144
-Want a piece of me, chump?
-Get him!

435
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,021
-Get him!
-Get off of me.

436
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,859
Get off, motherfucker!

437
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,194
Come on!

438
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,863
That's enough.

439
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,208
Which one of you motherfuckers
killed my truck?

440
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,043
-Get off me, man!
-Get off!

441
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,338
All right, now, you truckload of shit.

442
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,174
Fess up, or the whole
damn drag-ass squad...

443
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,594
...does the airborne shuffle
six miles back to base.

444
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,890
Goddamn it, shit for brains! Who did it?

445
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,771
I did it, sergeant.

446
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,606
Good. Come down here, boy.

447
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,566
And bring your shit!

448
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,614
Rest of you, sit your asses down.

449
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,305
Nobody saves anybody,
you stupid son of a bitch.

450
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,641
What the fuck are you doing, man?

451
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,060
It's not doing me any favors.

452
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,945
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2 out.

453
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,614
Miter has properly demonstrated...

454
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:11,493
...the use of the TA-312 field radio.

455
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,664
Except for this,
which is not in the manual.

456
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,625
If you ever catch Charlie...

457
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,004
...you might want info on where
the rest of his buddies is.

458
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,967
Only Charlie is a close-lipped bastard
who won't tell you fuck all.

459
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,013
That's why you tie his gook hands,
take down his gook pants...

460
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,807
...and grab his gook balls.

461
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,101
Here, Miter, hold these.

462
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,521
You pinch these clips on each
of his slant-eyed nuts...

463
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,149
...and you juice up the radio...

464
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,489
...that'll send enough of a shock,
he'll tell you anything you want.

465
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,993
Hell, he'll tell you
the minor-league baseball scores.

466
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,953
-You read me?
-Yes, sergeant.

467
00:31:55,163 --> 00:32:00,000
He'll tell you how his mother wipes
her ass if you give him this juice.

468
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,296
Not only that, you'll be able
to find him real easy next time.

469
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,174
Because he'll light up
the fucking night.

470
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,851
No one said you could leave.

471
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,562
-Why?
-Why what?

472
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,315
Why would l do that
to another human being?

473
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,528
Brother's right.

474
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,032
What the fuck's wrong with you?
That's one of your men.

475
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,992
Get him back here, boy.

476
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,494
-Bozz!
-Go get him, boy.

477
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,204
Jesus, Bozz.

478
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,206
Don't do this to me.

479
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,709
Get back here,
you worthless sack of shit!

480
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,586
Bozz!

481
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,092
You can't control your own men,
it is your ass.

482
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,843
Drop trou.

483
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,721
-What?
-Drop trou!

484
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,393
Double-time, come on! Skivvies too.

485
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,190
Well, what do you know?
You do have a pair of balls after all.

486
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,735
-Wilson, get over here. Crank this thing.
-Yes, sergeant.

487
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,946
We'll now demonstrate
the proper way...

488
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,533
...to give information
when connected to the TA-312.

489
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,911
See if you can tell me
why you can't control your men.

490
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,622
See if you light up tonight.

491
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,460
-Light him up.
-Shut the fuck up, Hicks.

492
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,878
Contact.

493
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,388
Never even touched you, son.

494
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:41,268
That's it. Class dismissed.
Go on to your next class.

495
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,936
Go on.

496
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,647
Go on!

497
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:53,238
Wilson, looks like we're having
roasted nuts tonight, huh?

498
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,991
I didn't know you
was so goddamn funny.

499
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,272
I can't wait to catch me a VC,
spark his balls off.

500
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,691
I'll start with you tonight, Miter.

501
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,402
Getting this, Pax?
The crazed, sadistic soldier...

502
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,154
...who flips out and kills people.

503
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,615
I think I saw you look at
Miter's balls earlier.

504
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,825
Funny there, Bozz. Funny, yeah.

505
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,496
You're a disgrace to the uniform,
fucking piece of shit!

506
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,790
Hey! Hey, what the fuck?

507
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,418
Break it up, man!

508
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,215
Get the fuck up! Civilian bullshit!

509
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,843
What the hell is going on? Miter!

510
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,472
You better do some fast explaining
or your men in a world of hurt.

511
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,349
There was an argument...

512
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:06,019
-...and one of the men--
-Slipped on the soap in the shower.

513
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,188
Wrestling. lt got out of hand.

514
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,233
It happens when people live together,
fuck together.

515
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,573
Sorry, soldier, you must've
slipped on some soap yourself.

516
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,158
What's wrong with you?

517
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,662
Look like you ate some frozen shit
for breakfast.

518
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,042
Nothing's wrong, sergeant.

519
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,379
It better stay that way,
you read me? All of you.

520
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,342
-Goddamn it, do you hear me?
-Yes, sergeant!

521
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,722
You got guard duty. Four listening posts
at the edge of the perimeter.

522
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,267
Dig yourself a hole
and forget about chow.

523
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:51,565
Out here, you're challenged on guard duty.
And you do it by the book.

524
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,568
But in Nam, if you hear something
in the bushes...

525
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,903
...l mean anything, you open fire.

526
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,615
You fire into those bushes until
you kill whatever made that sound.

527
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,451
When the sun comes up,
I don't give a fuck...

528
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,913
...whether it's man, woman, child
or little Johnny next door.

529
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,374
Kill it or you're not coming home.

530
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,418
Like the My Lai massacre, sergeant?

531
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,715
Paxton...

532
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,259
...why don't you join
your asshole buddy?

533
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,096
Missing a meal would be good for
your wisecracking ass also.

534
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,976
Now let's fall back in for chow!

535
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,813
Goddamn it, do it now!
You want to march six miles tonight?

536
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,773
Fucking weapons at ease!

537
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,904
Feel like l'm digging
my own fucking grave here.

538
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,240
When I was a kid...

539
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,327
...l used to think I could
dig my way to China.

540
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,288
You watched too many cartoons, Jim.

541
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,168
Maybe if we dig long and hard enough,
we'll tunnel our way out of this dump.

542
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,753
Why don't you?

543
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,464
My arm's too tired.

544
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,801
No, really. Why don't you get
yourself out of the Army?

545
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,512
I'm not that brave.

546
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,810
In that case,
I'll just have to bury you myself.

547
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,919
Move it out! Come on, move it out!

548
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,589
Stay the fuck down!

549
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,886
Stay the fuck where you are!

550
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,722
Move! You got to move it!

551
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,058
Stay the fuck down!
They're firing in our path!

552
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,020
-Stay down! Stay down!
-Move it, Bozz!

553
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,896
-Move it!
-Cease fire.

554
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,815
Miter! What the hell's wrong with you?

555
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,068
When your men are told to move out,
they move out!

556
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,237
When I give orders,
you're supposed to jump.

557
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,031
-Do you read me?
-Yes, sergeant!

558
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,868
The M-60s fired directly across our path!
They'd have cut us in two!

559
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:53,872
Who gave you permission to open
your fucking mouth? Miter's platoon guide!

560
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,125
You gotta flank that M-60! ls that clear?

561
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,918
Yes, sergeant.

562
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,296
If you don't want these
dumb-ass bitches dead...

563
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,757
...you wouldn't take them
in the belly of a pig...

564
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,800
...with a 762 to split their skull!

565
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,094
You flank the objective!

566
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,804
-You read me?
-Yes, sergeant!

567
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,932
-Get these fucking men out the hole!
-Move it out!

568
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,934
Stay down! Stay down!

569
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,437
Stay down!

570
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,231
What did you say, maggot-brained
son of a bitch?!

571
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,524
I said, stay down.

572
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,485
Get these men out the hole now!

573
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,738
-Platoon guide, do it! Do it!
-Move it! Come on, goddamn it!

574
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,948
-Move it!
-Stay down.

575
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,659
Are you stupid enough
to fuck with me, boy?

576
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,579
Tomorrow at base
it's you, me and the captain.

577
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,124
If your insubordinate ass ain't
in stockade by midday chow...

578
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,168
...l'll kill you myself!

579
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,297
You're not gonna kill me, sergeant.

580
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,009
I don't know what you'll do to me,
but you won't kill me.

581
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,809
-Goddamn you, boy!
-Out of the trench!

582
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,477
Don't turn your back on me!

583
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,063
Get your ass with the other men now!

584
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,483
I understand your position.
I ain't trying to fuck things up for you.

585
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,278
You got your army to run
and people to kill. I'm not part of it.

586
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,988
Nobody quits the Army.

587
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,532
I'm not quitting...

588
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,867
...l'm just not playing.

589
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,161
What's your first name, sergeant?

590
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,791
Ezra.

591
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,543
Can l offer you a smoke?

592
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,551
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

593
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,220
-Yes, sergeant!
-That doesn't fucking do it!

594
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,180
That doesn't fucking do it!

595
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,850
Give me a fucking answer!

596
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,518
Fuck!

597
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,646
Now you listen to me, son.

598
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,316
I been to where you're going.

599
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,528
Over there, you go from
living to dead awful quick.

600
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,574
What l'm trying to teach you
may save your worthless life, maybe.

601
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,203
I tell you what. If you snap shit
and soldier like I know you can...

602
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,081
-...I'll forget about this.
-Can't.

603
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,710
Shit, even if l wanted to,
I'm not there anymore.

604
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,713
What kind of bullshit statement is this?

605
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,381
Ezra, no.

606
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,216
It's just me.

607
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,553
Okay, Bozz, all right.

608
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,388
I'm gonna let you go.

609
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,099
But at garrison it's you and the CO,
I'm out of it.

610
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,229
Soldier, this army's gonna come down
on your ass hard. Both feet.

611
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,939
You know that, don't you?

612
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:29,194
They'll push through your papers
and send you where the dying's sweet.

613
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,071
Is this a trick?

614
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,744
Trying to make me a hero
or something?

615
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,039
Nope.

616
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,292
Well, good, Ezra.

617
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,129
Now you get your ass up
and join these men right now.

618
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,258
You're a big fucking baby!
Get out of my sight.

619
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,892
-Miter!
-What's he doing?

620
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,395
-Sergeant Landers!
-Goddamn it, what is it now?

621
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,944
Miter!

622
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,622
-That's enough, sergeant.
-You got some fucking nerve, shitbag!

623
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,879
Come on!

624
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,590
Time to go home, soldier!

625
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,468
I said, that's enough!

626
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,595
Let's go.

627
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,482
Goddamn it,
you men will learn to soldier.

628
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:53,528
The next dick tries a stunt like that
gets my size-14 Deltas...

629
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,489
...so far up their ass
they'll choke on my boot heel!

630
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,326
-Do you understand!
-Yes, sergeant!

631
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,496
You! Paxton!

632
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,874
-How much school have you had?
-Two years of college.

633
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,877
You're the next platoon guide.
Now put that man under arrest.

634
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,380
They didn't teach us
how to do that in college.

635
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,883
Are you some kind of fucking idiot?
You inbred retard.

636
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,219
You don't know how to do a thing,
do you?

637
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,346
Tell the man he's under arrest...

638
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,474
...he's confined to barracks,
he won't leave the area.

639
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,561
You get a card table
and set it up at the door!

640
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,062
Why, sergeant?

641
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,150
So a guard can sit there,
you backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.

642
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,902
You're fired as platoon guide,
dumb-ass dipshit!

643
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,532
You think that's funny?

644
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,908
-No, sergeant!
-Goddamn it!

645
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,537
Goddamn it! Give me 10,
you think it's fucking funny!

646
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,542
-Wilson!
-Yes, sergeant.

647
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,586
Get a card table.

648
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,004
You're on guard.

649
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,593
Guard, sergeant?

650
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,012
You heard me!
You want these 14s up your ass?

651
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,722
No, sergeant!

652
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,396
Bozz.

653
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,939
You're new platoon guide.

654
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,027
You put that piece of shit under arrest.

655
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,947
You tell these men to get their haircuts.
Every swinging dick.

656
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,450
Congratulations, sweetheart.

657
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,536
Sorry about that, Jim.

658
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,871
Oh, man.

659
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,081
Jealous?

660
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,083
Miter.

661
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,876
How you doing, man?

662
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,468
Okay, guys!

663
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,721
I ain't taking any of this shit seriously.

664
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,266
Just do what you have to do
so we can live together.

665
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,103
If any of you are gonna run off and hide,
let me know.

666
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,605
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.

667
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,275
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army. Hear me?

668
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,320
Sit the fuck down
at your dumb card table, punk.

669
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,823
Hey, fellas. Hey!

670
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,785
Look, all l know is that no one's
talked to me like that...

671
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,789
...since l got in this goddamned
green mean machine.

672
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,791
-Damn right.
-l attest to that.

673
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,461
So yeah, Bozz. See what happens, baby.

674
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,132
What else they gonna do,
send us to Viet-fucking-Nam?

675
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,425
Too late for that.

676
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,139
Say, Bozz? Can I get a weekend pass?

677
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,975
Put your panties away,
your mama's panties.

678
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,438
They're your mama's panties.
You ain't been laid in three years.

679
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,482
Get me off this base, l'll show you!

680
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,155
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.

681
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,990
Take a deep breath.

682
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,785
Take this shit off.

683
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,000
You gotta relax.

684
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,553
Shit, you gonna run again?

685
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,389
I hear people in New Orleans
help me get to Mexico.

686
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,599
It ain't that easy.

687
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,519
Army's got men, their whole job
is to look for you.

688
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,937
I don't care.

689
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,273
They'll catch you, bring you here
and put you in prison.

690
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,569
You best move, don't make me
have to thump you.

691
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,572
Want to go to military prison?
That's not the crazy you are.

692
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,912
Shut the fuck up!

693
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,416
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake up Wilson.
You don't want that.

694
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,558
Shit. What you gonna do now?

695
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,977
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.

696
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,563
-Shit, man, that won't work.
-Watch!

697
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,939
I said, that won't work!

698
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,109
Bust my hand,
they'll have to let me out. Right?

699
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,736
-lt ain't gonna work.
-Come on, Bozz!

700
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,156
Break my goddamn hand
so l can go home!

701
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,427
You know what l am, Bozz?
I'm a butcher.

702
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,970
Yeah, we all butchers.

703
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,097
No, I'm a real butcher.

704
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:17,101
-You haven't killed anyone yet.
-Goddamn it, l mean a real butcher.

705
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,313
Back home. I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.

706
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,316
Did it in high school,
did it after high school.

707
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,611
I could cut you a piece of meat
so clean...

708
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,363
...it'll have you praying to beefsteak.

709
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:34,368
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.

710
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,667
You laughing at me?

711
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,296
No, Miter. I ain't laughing at you.

712
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,843
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.

713
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,720
I didn't make no money.

714
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,473
Just a store boy,
that's what my daddy said.

715
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,809
"Hey, store boy. Hey, boy!"

716
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:02,521
Called me boy. Imagine that?
Shit kicker, calling me boy all the time.

717
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,857
I ain't a boy, goddamn it!

718
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,735
Telling me
how he's a big fancy war hero.

719
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,029
And my wife, that little--

720
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,242
My wife.

721
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,918
She's pretty.

722
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,088
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.

723
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,555
Prettiest girl
in the state of Louisiana.

724
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,229
She was mad at me
because l was working all the time.

725
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,272
Giving her the money...

726
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,233
...for junior college.

727
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,528
I knowed that, like...

728
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,239
...like l knowed later on...

729
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,035
...she was seeing
a fucking college boy on the side!

730
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,079
Goddamn it. My daddy said it.

731
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:04,208
He said, "See?
See what a dumb-ass bastard you are?

732
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,877
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.

733
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,214
You ought to have a little ring
in your nose."

734
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,552
So you thought you'd join the Army
and kill yourself like a real man.

735
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,390
Bozz, I know you can get people out.

736
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,392
Maybe.

737
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,312
Even in this wild-ass nonsense,
some rules fly by.

738
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:30,317
Please, Bozz. Please get me
out of here. Please?

739
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,278
Please, Bozz.

740
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,256
Well, look here.

741
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,799
Goddamn.

742
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,137
That captain sure didn't want
to let me go at first.

743
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,638
But l did like you said.

744
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,641
Told him the Army regs wanted me
to see the base psychiatrist.

745
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,645
-And that was it, huh?
-l wanted to thank you personally.

746
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,147
Doctor sent me on leave.

747
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,692
He'll contact the Red Cross,
get me out-processed...

748
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,527
...so l don't have to come back.

749
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,822
Good, Miter.
Glad to hear you're nuts, man.

750
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,203
-Best of luck, Miter.
-Thanks, Paxton.

751
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,579
Miter.

752
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,623
Take care, Johnson.

753
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,336
Thanks again, Bozz.

754
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,842
-So long.
-Go be a butcher, Miter!

755
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,846
-Try not to get shot, hear?
-Don't let your meat loaf, man.

756
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,941
Yeah, fuck you.

757
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,994
-Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
-At ease.

758
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:07,081
I understand you're the new platoon guide
for 2nd Platoon?

759
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,290
Yes, sir.

760
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,210
The fucking world is full
of fucking surprises.

761
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,380
It wasn't your plan to wear
sergeant's stripes...

762
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,841
...a week away from Tigerland in a war.

763
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,427
I don't know, sir.
The idea crossed my mind now and again.

764
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,764
I just didn't think it would
all be so pitiful sad.

765
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,397
Been looking over your 201.

766
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,566
You're a Texas boy.

767
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,570
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.

768
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,405
Dropout, worked construction.

769
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,407
-Get drafted?
-Yes, sir.

770
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,620
-Why didn't you stay in school?
-Maybe l needed some trouble, sir.

771
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,414
Well, you got it.

772
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,085
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.

773
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,381
The company's like the bad end
of a shit storm. Your platoon's the worst.

774
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:01,093
-Thank you, sir.
-That's not a compliment, smart-ass.

775
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,806
I don't want any more calls
from Battalion...

776
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,684
...asking me why this troopie needs
a hardship discharge...

777
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,562
...and that troopie needs
some kind of a mental wet nurse.

778
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,772
-You understand me?
-Yes, sir.

779
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,775
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.

780
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,656
A week from now you'll ship out
to Tigerland.

781
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,826
That'll crawl in your skull
and look out your eyes.

782
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,953
So let's start fresh.

783
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,081
-Give your people a weekend pass.
-Already done it, sir.

784
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,506
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.

785
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:44,011
I believe you could soldier as well
as any man in this army.

786
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:47,014
I even think you want to,
but you won't.

787
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,309
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

788
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:56,315
We're fighting a war, private.
Nobody knows how he's gonna come back.

789
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,486
That's not the kind of alive
I'm talking about, sir.

790
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,446
Here's 150 bucks.

791
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,879
Happy Halloween!

792
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,716
Cough it up, Brian.

793
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,301
Next time, Pax.

794
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,178
-Catch you later, buddy.
-All right.

795
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,481
Who's that girl you're talking to, Bozz?

796
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,111
-Trying to score some weed.
-Know what I don't get?

797
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,489
Why they haven't tossed you out
on some lunatic discharge...

798
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,033
-...some bullshit like that.
-l ain't crazy.

799
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,202
You're out of your fucking mind.

800
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:54,373
My reasons are my reasons
and no one has to like them.

801
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:57,501
What about these fucking war games?
What if it's a lie?

802
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,879
What if the guys who tell you and me
shit to do were lied to also?

803
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:05,050
Maybe since everyone believes
in the same mistake, you know...

804
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,428
...maybe they're all as confused
as we are.

805
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,848
All this "Boy's boy, man's man" bullshit.

806
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,683
Ever feel you're just being stupid?

807
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,729
Yeah. And it gives me a warm,
gooey feeling inside too.

808
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,458
Oh, man, we need women, Pax!

809
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:42,921
We need song and prayers to the moon
and deep breaths of the night wind.

810
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,381
Oh, l hear you, buddy!

811
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,593
No, Pax, l hear your asshole's tighter
than a migraine.

812
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,803
-Fuck you.
-Hey, man.

813
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,348
You're Bozz, right?

814
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,895
Fellas say that
if you don't want to go to Nam...

815
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,315
...you better pray to Jesus
or talk to Roland Bozz.

816
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,610
-Better start praying to Jesus, then.
-Sorry, kid.

817
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,112
-Oh, my God, look here.
-Oh, Jesus.

818
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,823
-l'm in trouble, l'm in trouble.
-You are.

819
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,951
-Come here, baby.
-l'll come if you got some money.

820
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,246
-l might have some money.
-You might or you do?

821
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,333
-You better have some.
-That's what I need to see.

822
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,335
-You want to see it?
-Yeah, I do.

823
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,754
-You got me covered, right?
-Here it is.

824
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,801
As l was about to come, l let out
this enormous fart. Should've seen her face.

825
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,470
Heard it in the next room.
Thought a grenade went off.

826
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,639
-How was yours?
-Expensive.

827
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,974
-You feel guilty?
-Because I'm broke?

828
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:39,645
I figured you for a guy
who left a sweetheart back home.

829
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,314
-She left me.
-That's why you joined the Army.

830
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:46,276
-Go on, confess.
-No, she broke it off when l enlisted.

831
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,279
-Didn't want to be a widow.
-She's got a point.

832
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,156
After all this bullshit...

833
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,868
...you still want to go kill women
and children in rice paddies?

834
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,665
-Come on, Paxton!
-Where you going, Bozz?

835
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,959
-l have no idea.
-Fuck.

836
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,463
-We are gonna jump, my young friend!
-Shit, Bozz, l'm too drunk.

837
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,216
-Come on, Paxton.
-l'll break my neck.

838
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,010
I don't want to go without you, man.

839
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,513
All right, l see what this is.

840
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,850
This jump, it's like this
existential leap of faith.

841
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,477
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I have no idea what that means.

842
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,855
We'll break those legs
and get out of the war.

843
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,524
-Okay, let's go.
-That's it, here we go.

844
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,401
-l'm ready.
-That's it.

845
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:31,029
It's gonna be on my count,
it'll be one, two, three.

846
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,323
-Let's break those legs.
-Okay, one!

847
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,700
Two!

848
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,368
Three!

849
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,372
-Was that the count?
-That was the count.

850
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,918
-Okay, okay.
-Here we go, here we go.

851
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,796
-Hot girl.
-Oh, yeah, hot girl.

852
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,048
On my count again, one, two, three.

853
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,426
Okay, one!

854
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,094
Two!

855
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,762
Three!

856
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,726
The legs won't move. Shit.

857
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,938
They're out for themselves. Goddamn it.

858
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,781
If that bottle was a leg,
we'd be out of the war about now.

859
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:20,037
-Looks like that would really hurt.
-Oh, fuck.

860
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:32,090
"Canadian Atlantic Railway."
There's your ride out of here, Bozz.

861
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:36,261
Go to Canada and live with
a fucking moose? No way, man.

862
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:40,224
Mexico, that's where l'd disappear to.
Can't you just smell it?

863
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,101
See it? Shit, l can smell it from here.

864
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:48,148
All that sunshine and tequila.
All those little senoritas walking around.

865
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,945
-Would you--?
-What?

866
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,073
If l told you there's people
who can get us to Mexico...

867
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,742
...away from the war, would you go?

868
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:01,954
No.

869
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,831
No, I wouldn't.

870
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,126
I enlisted, so there's a place for me.

871
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,380
If l don't go,
somebody has to take that place.

872
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,800
And if they die, well...

873
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,511
...they're dying for me.

874
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,682
You're a brave man.

875
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,686
-You're the brave one, Bozz.
-Bullshit.

876
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:31,942
Courage is when you're the only guy
who knows how shit-scared you are.

877
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,112
Then you're right.

878
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,155
I am the brave one.

879
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,326
Let's get out of here. We gotta get back.

880
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,830
Fucking Sergeant Thomas
will chew my ass for chow!

881
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:57,009
-Anytime today, Private Paxton.
-l'm coming, Private Bozz.

882
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,219
Fuck.

883
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,267
We should have jumped.

884
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,727
Yeah.

885
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,021
We can always go back.

886
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,982
Come on, man.

887
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,772
Fight!

888
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,860
Calm the fuck down here!
Calm the fuck down!

889
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,695
Get him, Bozz!

890
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,450
Get him, Bozz, get him!

891
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:44,574
Let him go! You're gonna hurt him,
Bozz, let him go!

892
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,118
Let him go, Bozz!

893
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,913
Let him go! Come on! Get off!
Goddamn it!

894
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:05,137
Damn you, Paxton. Let them fight.

895
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,805
Shut the fuck up.

896
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,349
You know he deserved every bit of it!

897
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,818
Took four hours for
my nose to stop bleeding.

898
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,320
Get off it, Wilson!
You had it coming, man!

899
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,032
-l was just fucking with him.
-lf Paxton here had kept quiet...

900
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,286
...boy, you'd be in hell right now,
sure as shit!

901
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,999
If l knew Bozz would stop,
I wouldn't have said anything.

902
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,668
Apologize, Bozz.

903
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,878
Get off it.

904
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,629
You heard me, Bozz.

905
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,716
You apologize to me right now.

906
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,719
Yeah, Bozz. Apologize to the man.

907
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,848
Say, "l'm sorry l didn't kill your ass!"

908
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,685
Think that's funny?

909
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,688
Fuck.

910
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,985
You tried to embarrass me
in front of every fucking person here.

911
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,696
Apologize.

912
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,835
Cease firing!

913
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,712
Clear your weapons!

914
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,884
Weapons clear.

915
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:39,231
Next group on the line, let's move.

916
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,735
-Weapon safe?
-Yeah, all clear.

917
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,362
Take a mag.

918
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,908
Ready on the right.

919
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,786
Ready on the left.

920
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,288
Firing line is ready.

921
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,582
Shooters, prepare to fire!

922
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,459
Fire!

923
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,933
Cease fire! Clear your weapons!

924
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,144
-Weapon clear, Barnes?
-All clear, Bozz.

925
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,985
-The fuck you doing, Wilson?
-Killing me a Cong.

926
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,196
What the hell's going on?

927
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,447
Unload that weapon.

928
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,575
Head or the body, Bozz? You choose.

929
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,285
Unload that fucking weapon!

930
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,956
-Head or the body?
-Damn it, unload that piece!

931
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,001
-Fuck you, Bozz.
-Unload that weapon!

932
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,794
Fuck you, Bozz!

933
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,005
Fuck you!

934
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,192
It's jammed.

935
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,321
Did you see that? Did you see that?

936
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,335
Looks like a misfeed jammed it.

937
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,463
Well, you are one lucky dick, Bozz.

938
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,507
It would've killed you
and the three people next to you.

939
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,802
-Hope you're not too disappointed.
-What do you want to do?

940
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:37,015
How about get Wilson as far
the fuck away as possible, sir?

941
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:42,145
Well, you have the right
to press for a court-martial.

942
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,815
Otherwise, you can let us
handle it our way.

943
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,360
I'd personally prefer that option.

944
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:52,155
-Consider it a personal favor to me.
-Get Wilson out, sir.

945
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,367
I don't recall telling you
to open your stinkhole.

946
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,995
He's right, sir.
Wilson shouldn't be in the Army.

947
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,206
Even if he did try to kill somebody.

948
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,584
You and I need to exchange some ideas.

949
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,378
That doesn't solve our problem.

950
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,256
We need to get him out now
or we'll file for a court-martial.

951
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,716
Paxton, you're dismissed.

952
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,386
Yes, sir.

953
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,398
He's learning.

954
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:31,528
Bozz, do you think the Army's never
seen pissants like you before?

955
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:35,532
I know you think you're some
big swinging-dick hero.

956
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,034
I know a lot of the men think so too.

957
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,955
But l know you for what you are.
You are a coward.

958
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:46,292
You're a born leader and you're afraid
to take any real responsibility!

959
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,796
That's why you dropped out of school,
why you drop out of everything!

960
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,423
You're pissing your life away!

961
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,383
I don't need the fucking Army...

962
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,219
...and l don't need the war
to tell me that, sir!

963
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,096
Get on your feet, soldier.

964
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,724
Attention!

965
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:06,146
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.

966
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:09,649
I don't want you drummed out
on some bad conduct discharge.

967
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:14,446
I want you exactly where you are.

968
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:18,450
And we'll just naturally chew you up.

969
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,999
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.

970
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,447
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.

971
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,699
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

972
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,702
-Shut your fucking mouth.
-You shut the fuck up.

973
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,954
-Guys, relax.
-l ain't starting.

974
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,332
You already got your ass beat once.

975
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,503
-Just watch your back in Tigerland.
-l'll do that.

976
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:16,132
I guess I'm supposed to joke
about how l owe you my life.

977
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:19,344
-He almost killed you.
-You jealous?

978
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,763
You wanted to know what it was like.

979
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,223
What what was like?

980
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,184
The great lesson of being close to death.

981
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,852
Know what l know?

982
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,146
Same thing you know.

983
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,190
We're in a real bad way.

984
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:55,922
Fuck.

985
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:59,259
Real bad way.

986
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,886
All right! Let's go! Move it!

987
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,513
Come on! Let's go!

988
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,057
-Come on! Move! Move!
-Move your ass!

989
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,226
Come on, fat boy! Move your ass!

990
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,353
Let's go, soldier!

991
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,610
Let's go! Let's go!

992
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,366
Welcome to Tigerland.

993
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,619
Your final training
before you're shipped overseas.

994
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,914
Here, everything's done
exactly as it is over there.

995
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,709
You will search and destroy, hunt and kill.

996
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,254
You'll move by chopper to secure
any area deemed necessary.

997
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,548
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.

998
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,426
Minor mistakes
will pay back major punishment.

999
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,053
Maybe you've heard we've lost this war.

1000
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,265
Or we've lost the support
of people here at home.

1001
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,601
It's too late to ask those questions.

1002
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:51,728
You're not back on the block.

1003
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,606
You're alive in a year, we'll talk about it.

1004
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,316
When you arrive in Nam...

1005
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,652
...it's important to get acclimated
as quickly as you can.

1006
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,946
Remember to think.

1007
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:04,282
-You understand me?
-Yes, sergeant!

1008
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:09,579
What matters now is sharpening your ability
to find and destroy the enemy.

1009
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,581
Practice how to stay alive.

1010
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,251
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.

1011
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,421
You're thinking you'll go
somewhere safe.

1012
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,797
You'll luck out.

1013
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,301
Tigerland is where
you stop bullshitting yourself.

1014
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:27,430
Sarge, you got any advice
on how to stay alive in Vietnam?

1015
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:30,433
-l do, private. Don't go.
-Right on, right on.

1016
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:33,144
My friend here wants the experience.

1017
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,271
Says he ain't scared.

1018
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,315
Well, good luck.

1019
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,152
If you ask me, I'll stick
with the smart and the scared.

1020
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:46,366
You'll be under the care of NCOs
and officers who were in combat.

1021
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,201
Listen to them.

1022
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,704
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.

1023
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,707
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.

1024
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,001
I've done two tours in Vietnam.

1025
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:59,837
My first in '67 with the 101 st.

1026
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:03,049
I just completed my second with MAC-V.

1027
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,135
I only have two words of advice for you.

1028
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,137
And those are to listen...

1029
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,847
...and to learn.

1030
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,184
All right, let's saddle up.

1031
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,145
Let's go! Let's saddle up!

1032
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,022
Let's go, goddamn it!

1033
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,569
Get down!

1034
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,364
Good job, Paxton. Good job.

1035
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,199
Good job, Johnson.

1036
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,534
All right.

1037
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,577
Get your ass behind that tree!

1038
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:35,707
Fantastic. You guys move
like fucking soldiers!

1039
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,209
Get your ass down!

1040
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,920
Ryan, get your ass down!

1041
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,339
Go! Move! Move!

1042
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,092
Bozz, keep that barrel out of the dirt!

1043
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:47,552
Move, move, move!

1044
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,722
Paxton, why are you slowing up?

1045
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,515
Get your ass down!

1046
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,392
You are the weak link!

1047
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,061
This is not the time to slow up.

1048
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:59,188
Adapt! Overcome!

1049
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,065
Move! Get in there!

1050
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,526
You good?

1051
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:05,570
Why were you slow, Paxton?

1052
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,614
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine, sergeant.

1053
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,586
Diagonal, Private Barnes.

1054
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,756
-So you don't chop your knee off.
-Yes, sergeant.

1055
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:33,264
Go ahead, Paxton. I gotta take a piss.

1056
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,142
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1057
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,495
"Jim Paxton on personal guide to pain."

1058
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:43,835
Get that fucking torch out of my face
and put that cigarette out.

1059
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:47,171
You might as well
hang a big neon sign that says:

1060
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,549
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here."

1061
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,677
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.

1062
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,012
-Do you understand that?
-Yes, sir.

1063
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:58,141
-Good.
-l'm still alive, sergeant.

1064
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,686
-What did you say?
-l said, l'm still alive.

1065
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:05,189
I miraculously survived the attack.

1066
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,525
-You didn't get hit?
-No.

1067
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,068
Are your friends alive?

1068
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,321
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.

1069
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:16,075
If you're gonna make up a story,
make up a happy one.

1070
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,203
I ain't making anything up, son.

1071
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,751
And in Vietnam there are no
happy fucking stories.

1072
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,511
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan...

1073
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:38,764
...that l went to AIT with.

1074
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:44,604
In '67, when the call came,
we got sent off to Nam.

1075
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:49,859
We had only been in country a few days.
We was green as grass.

1076
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:55,239
We were in a two-man listening post,
talking just like we are here.

1077
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,201
Kelly lit up a cigarette.

1078
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:01,787
One minute we were naming
his soon-to-be-born child...

1079
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,625
...and the next second
his brains were in my lap.

1080
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,390
The sniper zeroed in
on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.

1081
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,649
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.

1082
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,487
Respect for your superiors
and what they're trying to teach you.

1083
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:39,075
Respect for yourselves and your unit.

1084
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,828
And most important...

1085
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,123
...respect the enemy.

1086
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:54,131
You have 42 minutes...

1087
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,968
...then the squad's on patrol.

1088
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,267
Fuck.

1089
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:14,944
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese
village we could create for you...

1090
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:16,445
...here on the base.

1091
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:20,658
Now, listen. You're all gooks,
so nobody speaks English.

1092
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:24,662
Anybody asks you a question in English,
you answer, "No bic."

1093
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:28,499
It means, "l don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.

1094
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:32,503
Good. Private Bozz, you are
the only man that speaks English.

1095
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:37,800
Speak only to the man who identifies
himself as interpreter. Understood?

1096
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,802
-Yes, sir.
-Good. Private Paxton.

1097
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,512
You are the Vietcong.

1098
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:46,392
Those boys come through here, their
objective is to find the VC sympathizer.

1099
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:49,186
In other words, you, Private Paxton.

1100
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,480
They have five minutes.

1101
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,817
You tell them nothing.

1102
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,861
I warn you, they're beat up.

1103
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,030
They've been awake three nights.

1104
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,865
Forced marched all day.

1105
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:05,202
They fuck this up,
they'll march another six miles.

1106
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,704
One other thing:

1107
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:10,833
They find out which one of you is VC...

1108
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,711
...and you'll be the ones
out in the boonies...

1109
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,381
...on no sleep, forced marching
for the next two nights.

1110
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,674
Understood?

1111
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,885
-Yes, sergeant.
-Let's get to work.

1112
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,763
Private Bozz, Paxton. Over here.

1113
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,558
Let's see.... Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.

1114
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,061
Make it as realistic as possible.

1115
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,521
This is not a fucking joke.

1116
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,274
I like this. It's like a war theme park.

1117
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:38,194
I'm so tired. I'm gonna pass out.

1118
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,248
Hey, here they come.

1119
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,214
Shit.

1120
01:17:58,423 --> 01:17:59,632
It's Wilson.

1121
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,093
What?

1122
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:05,930
-l thought we got him out.
-There's a war going on.

1123
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:08,599
Plenty of room for psychopathic killers.

1124
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,394
Let's move it. We don't got much time.

1125
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,063
We gotta find the VC.

1126
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,112
Don't fuck with me.

1127
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:24,407
VC?

1128
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,160
Get your ass on the ground!

1129
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,458
Get on the fucking ground!

1130
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,502
You VC?

1131
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:40,297
You VC? You VC?

1132
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,841
How'd that feel?

1133
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:46,345
Need an interpreter?
I'm the only one that speaks English.

1134
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:51,100
How does that feel, Paxton?

1135
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:59,650
What are you gonna write about now?

1136
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:06,449
What are you writing in your journal?

1137
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,873
Don't fucking move!

1138
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,210
Let go of him, goddamn it!

1139
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,471
-You're in charge. On your feet!
-Yes, sergeant.

1140
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,307
Where is your weapon, soldier?

1141
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:32,850
There it is.

1142
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:36,395
Why didn't you secure the area,
Private Wilson?

1143
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:40,483
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control!

1144
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,193
Yes, sergeant.

1145
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:45,654
Did you find any VC?

1146
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:49,700
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.

1147
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:51,368
Come here.

1148
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:57,708
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.

1149
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,211
Get out of here! Let's go. Move!

1150
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,546
-l'm gonna kill you.
-ls that right?

1151
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,841
-Again? You gonna kill me again?
-l'll kill you.

1152
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,010
Get your hands off him!

1153
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,096
You want to go?

1154
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,891
Get the fuck out of here!

1155
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:16,811
-Hey.
-Hey, hey, hey.

1156
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,190
-Get the fuck out!
-l'll break your neck!

1157
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:23,192
-Let's move!
-Get the fuck out of here!

1158
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,069
Somebody grab my steel pot.

1159
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,071
Get out of here.

1160
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,406
-How you doing?
-Shit.

1161
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,075
Is he all right?

1162
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,701
No, he's not all right.

1163
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,204
Take your time.

1164
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,980
-You going?
-l can't take you with me.

1165
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,649
Not me. Paxton. He's hurting.

1166
01:21:45,817 --> 01:21:46,942
He signed up.

1167
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,819
And you judged him for it.

1168
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:52,114
You even made me feel guilty
and l was drafted.

1169
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:58,829
You saw what Wilson did to him today.

1170
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,166
He's broken down.

1171
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,169
And the Army didn't do
all the breaking. Take him.

1172
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:08,380
It's ain't my fault if he waited till now
to realize what he did.

1173
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:11,133
I ain't got no time for sad stories
but my own.

1174
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,844
-Take him with you.
-Fuck off!

1175
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,722
Wilson's gonna take
his hate out on somebody.

1176
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:21,727
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.

1177
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,146
Johnson, l like you, but fuck off.

1178
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,816
Yeah, well,
I ain't standing in your way.

1179
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,290
Rise and shine, gentlemen!

1180
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,459
Let's go, gentlemen! Roll them!

1181
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:30,587
Let's go! Move! Get on your feet!

1182
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:35,384
I know you're tired, but you'll be
doing a lot of this in the next year.

1183
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,094
If you're not...

1184
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:41,306
-...then you're lying still in a body bag...
-Where's Bozz?

1185
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,100
...waiting for a dust-off.

1186
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,228
Where is your squad leader?

1187
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,397
Is this his weapon?

1188
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,442
Does anybody know
where your squad leader is?

1189
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,110
Where is he, Johnson?

1190
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:03,120
-Where is your weapon, Private Bozz?
-Right here, sarge.

1191
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,496
I know that.

1192
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:08,459
The next time you decide
to take a piss or a fucking shit...

1193
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:10,794
...you make sure you have your weapon.

1194
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:14,423
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it?

1195
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:18,135
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think l'd need it.

1196
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:19,845
Very funny.

1197
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,306
You take point.

1198
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:26,852
Paxton, take slack. Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.

1199
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,353
Listen up.

1200
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:32,107
You'll square off
against the boys from yesterday.

1201
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:34,026
They may have booby traps.

1202
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,820
They may have forward observers
watching.

1203
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:40,282
They may do all manner of shit
that you don't know.

1204
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:45,454
That's why you will keep
your eyes open and your mouths shut.

1205
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,999
-ls that fucking understood?
-Yes, sarge.

1206
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,169
Let's move out.

1207
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:58,634
-Welcome back.
-You owe me 150 bucks.

1208
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:05,474
Hurry up, Paxton. Let's go.

1209
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,755
Dixie, dixie, my 12.

1210
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:38,507
Dixie, my 12.

1211
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,762
Move it! Come on!

1212
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:18,190
You okay?

1213
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:27,551
Fuck, Bozz. Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked?

1214
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,720
Relax. You'll be fine.

1215
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,722
You'll be fine.

1216
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:11,762
Wilson, what the hell are you doing?
That's live ammo.

1217
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:10,153
Ambush! 12 o'clock!

1218
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,036
Live ammo!

1219
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,667
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1220
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:43,854
Fuck!

1221
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:47,315
Private Wilson!

1222
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:49,693
Private-fucking-Wilson!

1223
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,529
Private Wilson, look at me, goddamn it!

1224
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,031
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1225
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,201
Look at me.

1226
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,704
You will place your weapon on safe!

1227
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,374
You will raise your weapon
above your fucking head...

1228
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,043
...or l'll blow your fucking brains out!

1229
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,088
Oh, Jesus!

1230
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:12,048
Do it!

1231
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,053
On your fucking knees, now!

1232
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:18,889
Get on your fucking knees!

1233
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:23,518
You will be court-martialed!
Do you fucking hear me?

1234
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,441
-What happened?
-An accident. My fault.

1235
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,277
Let me look.

1236
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,532
Get him up.

1237
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,756
Let this shit out. Now, bring it on.

1238
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,269
Sing it, boy.

1239
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,190
I miss my grandma's apple pie

1240
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:14,236
Shit, I miss getting high

1241
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:18,615
And my Uncle Sam is sending me to die

1242
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,617
You know what now?

1243
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:03,034
Let's go, move it!
This war is not gonna last forever!

1244
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:05,787
Bozz, bus number three!

1245
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:09,040
You don't want to miss this war!
Let's go!

1246
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:11,751
Hey! Bozz.

1247
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,172
-Want to come along?
-l wanted to, but you wouldn't let me.

1248
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,466
How's your eye?

1249
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:24,389
Got an injury bad enough to get out,
no permanent damage. Imagine that.

1250
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,058
More corny wisdom for your book.

1251
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:29,811
"In the country of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king."

1252
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,231
Pretty fancy shooting, Tex. Thank you.

1253
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:37,569
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.

1254
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,738
No, it wasn't.

1255
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:43,199
Somebody had to take your place.

1256
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:47,203
Bozz! Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.

1257
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:50,373
Write me when you get there.

1258
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,876
This is it, man.

1259
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,211
No more phony Army buddy crap.

1260
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,721
Go home.

1261
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:07,223
Live a long time.

1262
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:10,560
Try not to be too much of an asshole.

1263
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:15,023
I'm gonna write a whole book about this.

1264
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:17,067
Tell everyone about you.

1265
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:19,194
Paxton.

1266
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,572
Sergeant Thomas...

1267
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,949
...sorry for my misbehavior earlier.

1268
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:30,580
Real sorry.

1269
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,385
See you back here. Take care.

1270
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:44,803
-Watch your back.
-See you.

1271
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:49,224
-l'll write a book about you, Bozz!
-No, you won't.

1272
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:52,102
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.

1273
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:54,813
Jesus! Bozz!

1274
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:58,108
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book!

1275
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:01,277
What are you doing? Shit!

1276
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:03,780
Stop the bus!

1277
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,785
What is this shit?

1278
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,757
I never saw Bozz again.

1279
01:35:24,093 --> 01:35:26,594
Some guys said he died in Nam...

1280
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,805
...but he was never listed.

1281
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:32,767
Some said he just disappeared over there.

1282
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:36,354
One guy called and said
he thought he saw him in Mexico...

1283
01:35:36,647 --> 01:35:38,440
...with a beautiful woman.

1284
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:41,484
But knowing Bozz...

1285
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:45,113
...he'd be pissed off
I was talking about him anyway.

1286
