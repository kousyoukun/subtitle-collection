11
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:45,466
我當然知道代理人是幹什麼的
Of course I know what an attorney is.

12
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,177
就像律師  只不過價錢要貴很多
It's like a lawyer, only the bills are bigger.

13
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,014
好吧  我等你

14
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:54,473

哈羅  瓦恩薩普先生?哈勒德·安卓

是的  我可能有空
Yeah, I could be free.

17
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,364
是替你們公司幹嗎?
Would this be with your firm?

18
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:17,245
再講一次!
Gimme that again.

19
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,374
路易士...怎麼拼?
Louis...how do you spell that?

20
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:28,004
賽佛...好  這是什麼...外國姓?
Cyphre...okay. What is it...foreign?

21
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,966
你的客戶是一個外國人嗎?
Is your client a foreigner?

22
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:38,596
瓦恩薩普先生  你可不可以再和我說的詳細些?
Mr. Winesap, could you give me a few more details?

23
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:42,935
是的  我知道這個地方
Okay, I know the place.

24
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:47,063
那娷鰴o很遠  但我會准時到的
It's a long way up, but I can be there.

25
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:33,563
哈婺籊!馬上給我看看你們到底有多愛上帝!
Hallelujah! Show right now how much you love God!

I want you to show! It's your time!

27
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,527

Open up your hearts and open up your wallets!

28
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:41,278

00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:47,117
全捐出來吧!贊美主!有人曾經講起過我  
And give it up! Praise the Lord! Somebody has been talking about me

31
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:49,658
總坐著卡迪拉克到處走
riding around in a Cadillac.

32
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,498
如果你們愛我並願意全部奉獻給我
If you love me and want to give to me,

33
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:55,333
那我應該坐在勞斯萊斯車子中!
then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!

34
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,974
請跟我來  好嗎?
Would you come with me, please?

35
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,196
一個不幸的丈夫  
An unfortunate husband

36
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,783
虔誠的一個信徒對自己的頭開了一槍  非常不幸
of one of Pastor John's flock took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.

37
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:36,037
安卓先生?請進!
Mr. Angel? Please?

38
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:04,813
請允許我介紹我的客戶  路易士·賽佛先生
Allow me to introduce my client, Monsieur Louis Cyphre.

39
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,485
-你好  哈利·安卓  -很高興見到您  安卓先生
- Hi, Harry Angel. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.

40
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:16,573
頭次見面  我不想顯得太沒有禮貌
I don't want to appear impolite,

41
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:18,511
可是  你能給我看一下你的身份證嗎?
but do you have any l. D.?

42
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:19,826
哦  當然可以!在這...
Sure! Here...

43
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,540
怎麼樣?
How's that?

44
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,793
持槍證
Gun perm it

45
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,469
我並不是針對你...我這個人做事比較謹慎
Nothing personal. I'm a little over-cautious.

46
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:44,765
-你應該了解這些規矩的  -我了解...
- You know how these things are. - I know. So...

47
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:48,186
你是從哪兒知道我的?
How did you hear about me?

48
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,277
要我猜的話...你們肯定是在電話本中找到我的
I guess you guys just looked in the phone book.

49
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,301
以前總是這樣  因為...  
Usually that's what happens. Because...

50
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:07,328
我姓"安卓"  在第一頁"A"那排
my name is "Angel", it's under "A"...

51
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,289
人們總是懶惰的  他們只看第一排  
People are lazy. They see the first name

52
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,582
-而且...  -強尼·菲佛瑞.
- and...- Johnny Favorite.

53
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:13,916
什麼?
Excuse me?

54
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:17,420
你對強尼·菲佛瑞這個名字有沒有印象?
Do you by chance remember the name Johnny Favorite?

55
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,631
強尼·菲佛瑞  不  我沒印象
Johnny...No, I don't think so.

56
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,759
-你從沒聽說過他嗎?  -我應該知道他嗎?
- You never knew him? - Am I supposed to?

57
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:27,220
他在戰前是一個憂鬱歌手  在他們那行很出名
He was a crooner before the war, quite famous in his way.

58
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:32,059
-好吧  我告訴你  賽飛先生...  -是賽佛先生
- Well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre... - Mr. Cyphre

59
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,729
對不起!
I'm sorry!

60
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:41,150
我一般情況下不參與那些
I usually don't get involved

61
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:44,327
牽涉到任何嚴重事情的工作
in anything very heavy.

62
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:48,406
我通常只是處理一些保險糾紛  離婚...
I usually handle insurance jobs, divorces,

63
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,909
這類簡單的事情
things of that nature.

64
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:53,798
有些時候運氣好的話...  
If I'm lucky sometimes...

65
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,789
我也處理些人的事情  但是我不了解
I handle people. But I don't know

66
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,416
任何憂鬱歌手  
no crooners

67
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:02,878
-或其他出名的人  -他的真正名字是利布林  
- or anybody famous. - His real name was Liebling.

68
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:07,507
我也沒聽說過任何叫利布林的人  
I don't know any Liebling, either.

69
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:11,010
你想讓我幹什麼?
What do you want from me?

70
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,179
-這個人欠你錢嗎?  -並不是你想得那回事
- Does this man owe you money? - Not quite.

71
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,807
我在強尼演唱事業剛剛起步的時候幫過他的忙
I helped Johnny at the beginning of his career.

72
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,727
你就像...他的經理人?
You were like...his agent?

73
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,439
不!
No!

74
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,773
不是這麼回事...
Nothing so...

75
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,943
賽佛先生有一份契約
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.

76
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,821
如果他死了的話  有些東西我要收回來
Certain collateral was to be forfeited in the event of his death.

77
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,667
我們正在談論這個人已經死了嗎?
You're talking about a guy that's dead?

78
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:37,493
他在1943年被應征入伍
No, He was drafted 1943...

79
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,288
在北非"特殊娛樂服務"
in North Africa, "special entertainment service"

80
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,791
期間曾遭到一次突然襲擊  他的頭和臉受傷非常嚴重
There was attacked was badly injured about his head and face.

81
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,128
-他有...  -健忘症  你們叫它...
- He had...- Amnesia. I think you call it...

82
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:50,353
腦震蕩
Shell shock.

83
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:53,131
-對  -我知道是什麼感覺
- Exactly! - I know how that feels.

84
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,559
是嗎?你也服過兵役嗎?
Why? Were you in the services?

85
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,886
我只呆了很短一段時間
I was in for a short time.

86
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:01,222
但是我很討厭...
But I got a little fucked up.

87
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:07,311
對不起!他們送我回來  而我錯過了所有的事情:
Excuse me! They shipped me home, and I missed the whole shebang:

88
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,689
戰爭  獎章  所有的東西
the war, the medals, everything.

89
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,983
我猜你一定認為我很幸運
I guess you could say I was lucky.

90
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,569
強尼就沒那麼好命了  他回來後性格變得很怪  
Johnny wasn't so lucky. He returned home a zombie.

91
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,199
他的朋友把他轉到北部的一家私人醫院  
His friends had him transferred to a private hospital upstate.

92
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:25,286
在那媔i行一些強化的心理治療
There was some sort of radical psychiatric treatment involved.

93
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:28,580
他的律師被授權支付一些日常的開支
His lawyer is authorized to pay for some daily expenses

94
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,667
你也應該了解這種情況
But you know how it is.

95
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,206
他變成了植物人
He remained a vegetable,

96
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,584
而據我了解...我和他之間的合同就不受重視了!
and my contract was never honored.

97
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:36,296
這麼回事..
I see.

98
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:39,590
我不想顯得太唯利是圖
I don't want to sound mercenary.

99
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,471
我唯一感興趣的就是...他是否還活著?
My only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.

100
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,683
每年我都會收到一份簽好的書面證明...
Each year my office receives a signed affidavit confirming

101
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:53,228
證明強尼·利布林確實還活著
that Johnny Liebling is indeed among the living.

102
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,356
但是上個周末  賽佛先生和我  
But last weekend Monsieur Cyphre and l, just by chance,

103
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,985
恰好路過在波基普西的醫院(位於紐約)  
were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.

104
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,496
我們決定親自去查一下
We decided to check for ourselves,

105
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,864
但是我們只查到些令人誤解的信息
but we got misleading information.

106
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,448
他們在找借口!
The run-around!

107
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:11,995
我不希望有麻煩  也不喜歡大驚小怪
I didn't want to cause a scene, I hate any sort of fuss.

108
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,455
我想  也許你可以
I thought, perhaps you could

109
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,624
悄悄地開展一些調查...
subtly and in a quiet manner...

110
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,669
-你想讓我把它查清楚?  -對
- You want me to check it out. - Check it out!

111
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,845
很奇怪  我好像以前見過你
I have a feeling I've met you before.

112
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,389
不知道  我沒什麼印象
I don't know, I don't think so.

113
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:50,780
你聽說過強尼·菲佛瑞嗎?
Do you remember the name Johnny Favorite?

114
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:57,995
他的真正名字是利布林  
His real name was Liebling.

115
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,586
我唯一感興趣的就是...他是否還活著?
My only interest in Johnny is in finding out if he's alive or dead.

116
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,795
-我可以幫到你嗎?  -我叫哈利·康羅伊
- May I help you? - My name is Harry Conroy

117
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,465
國家健康協會的
from the National lnstitute of Health.

118
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,510
你想見什麼人嗎?
Is there anyone in particular you want to see?

119
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,140
協會正在開展一項關於不可治愈外傷案件的調查
The lnstitute is conducting a survey of incurable trauma cases.

120
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:10,811
我聽說你們這兒有個病人符合我們的條件
I understand you have a patient here fitting that description?

121
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,147
沒有預約的話  我是不會讓你見任何人的
We can't let you see anyone without an appointment.

122
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,984
我很感激  但是也許你可以檢查一下文件  
I appreciate that, but maybe you could check the files

123
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,236
看看我有沒有找錯地方
and make sure I'm on the right track.

124
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:23,072
沒必要的話  我不想打擾任何人
I don't want to bother anybody unnecessarily.

125
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,033
好嗎?謝謝你
Okay? Thank you.

126
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,566
病人的名字是什麼?  
What's the name of the patient?

127
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,328
利布林  喬納森·利布林

等一下  我查查看
One moment please, I'll check.

129
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:39,879
上個周末也是你上班嗎?

我姊妹的婚禮

132
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:53,016
我們確實有利布林先生  但是他被轉走了
We did have a Mr. Liebling, but he was transferred.

133
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:55,518
-你確定嗎?  -這上面是這麼記錄的
- You sure? - That's what it says.

134
00:13:56,352 --> 00:14:00,439
-是什麼時候的事?  -幾年前  43年12月.
- And when was that? - Years ago, in December '43.

135
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,358
我可以看一看嗎?謝謝
May I take a look at this? Thanks.

136
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,612
這是最近寫的嗎?
Is this recent?

137
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,156
-這是個老文件  -但這是圓珠筆的字跡!
- It's an old file. - It's in ballpoint!

138
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:13,534
43年不大可能有圓珠筆
They weren't big on ballpoint in '43.

139
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:15,911
這是圓珠筆跡嗎?
Is that ballpoint?

140
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,289
我看著也是!他們那時沒有圓珠筆嗎?
Well, I'll be! They didn't have ballpoints back then?

141
00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:21,624
沒有
No.

142
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,292
這堻o個...
This here

143
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:25,378
福勒博士  
Dr. Fowler,

144
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,690
他仍然在這堣u作嗎?
does he still work here?

145
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:30,007
僅是兼職的  他年紀很大了
Just part-time, he's old.

146
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,968
謝謝你
Thank you.

147
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,822
你晚上都是這會回來嗎?
Time for your evening fix?

148
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,244
你是誰?你怎麼進來的?
Who are you? How did you get in here?

149
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:23,539
郵箱寄進來的  我是一個私家偵探
Through the mailslot. I'm a private detective.

150
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:26,292
破門而入是嚴重罪行  
Breaking and entering is a crime,

151
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,436
不管你是什麼人都一樣
whoever or whatever you are.

152
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,796
嗨老兄  那你叫警察呀!
Hey man, call the police!

153
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,841
你那樣做的話  警察可能會發現你在冰箱
Which you won't do in case they discover your opium den

154
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,342
私藏冰毒!
in the icebox!

155
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:48,395
我是一位醫生  我完全有權在家保存一些醫藥制品
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled to keep pharmaceuticals at home.

156
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:53,274
去和別人說這些!你這堣ㄥ僅是一兩瓶那麼簡單  
Tell it to somebody else! We're not talking about a Band-Aid

157
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:57,403
-你上癮多久了?  -你到底想幹什麼?
- or a tube of unguent. How long you been hooked? - What do you want?

158
00:17:58,113 --> 00:18:00,698
一些有關強尼·利布林的資料
Information about Johnny Liebling.

159
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:04,160
很多年以前  我治療過一個叫這個名字的病人
I treated a patient of that name many years ago.

160
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,620
我不是那麼好糊弄的
I'm not fooling around.

161
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,992
要麼你給我一些有用的資料...
Either you give me some answers

162
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,668
要麼我親自打電話給警察
or I'll call the police myself.

163
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,700
我剛才看到樓上在做著一些東西
I've seen the works cooking upstairs,

164
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:17,922
那玩意兒肯定不是索爾克先生(美國細菌學家)的疫苗
and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.

165
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:21,467
他是戰爭期間的一個演藝人員  是個精神病的案例
He was an entertainer during the war, a neuro case.

166
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:22,853
沒有機會恢複  
No chance of recovery,

167
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:25,637
因此我把他轉到奧爾巴尼(位於紐約)的V.A.醫院
so I transferred him to a V.A. hospital in Albany.

168
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:29,640
我不想讓你吃驚  但是我檢查過  他不在那
I hate to shake you up, but I checked, and he's not there.

169
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,727
你辦了假的轉院手續
You faked the transfer.

170
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:36,981
因為他最近有一個訪客  12年來的第一次
Because he recently had a visitor, the first in 1 2 years.

171
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:39,733
名人  嗯?
Popular guy, eh?

172
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,776
現在他在哪?
Where is he now?

173
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:45,822
-我不知道...  -過來!
- I don't know...- Come here!

174
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:51,452
自從他來這埵禨|  我就沒見過他
I haven't seen him since he was a patient here.

175
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,288
你在冒冷汗!看看你!
You're in a cold sweat! Look at you!

176
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:58,959
你甚至等不及我走  就想給自己來一針
You can't wait for me to leave so you can raid the icebox.

177
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:04,172
你越早把事情講清楚  就越早能舒服一下
The sooner you get out with it, the sooner you can shoot up.

178
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,886
我再問你一次:他在哪?
I'll ask you again: Where is he?

179
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,888
我不知道
I don't know.

180
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:16,590
幾年前的一個晚上  突然來了一幫人
Some people came one night years ago.

181
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,393
他和他們一起坐車走了
He got in the car with them and left.

182
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:21,395
他坐車走了?我以為這家夥是個植物人呢
He got into a car? I thought this guy was a vegetable.

183
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:25,066
開始他是處於昏迷中  但很快就恢複過來了
At first he was in a coma but he quickly recovered.

184
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:27,568
但是他仍然有健忘症
But he still suffered from amnesia.

185
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:29,278
朋友
The friends.

186
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:31,678
這些朋友是誰?
Who were the friends?

187
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,200
他的名字是  開利  愛德華·開利
His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.

188
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:38,703
我不認識那個小姐  她始終呆在汽車
The young lady I don't know. She stayed in the car.

189
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,706
他們帶他到哪去了?
Where did they take him?

190
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:43,374
南方  那個男的說:"我們送他回家"
Down South. The man said: "We're taking him home."

191
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,877
-給了你什麼好處?  -2萬5千塊
- And what was the deal? - $25,000.

192
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,115
為什麼給你這麼多?
For what?

193
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:50,339
我偽造證據使他看起來仍在醫院
I was supposed to pretend that he was still a patient in hospital.

194
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:52,326
醫院管理部門沒有懷疑嗎?  
Didn't the administration suspect?

195
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:54,509
他們為什麼會懷疑?我不斷的更新醫療紀錄
Why should they? I kept the charts

196
00:19:54,968 --> 00:20:00,181
而且賬單按時支付的話  別人是不會懷疑的
up to date. And no one asks questions when the bills get paid.

197
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,808
告訴我一些關於強尼·利布林的情況
Tell me about Johnny Liebling.

198
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,730
-他長得什麼樣子?  -不知道他的臉被毀容了
- What did he look like? - No idea. His face was damaged.

199
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:12,484
他做了面部整容手術  他走的那天臉上還紮著繃帶
He had facial reconstruction. He was in bandages the day he left.

200
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,362
關於開利  你能和我講些什麼嗎?
What can you tell me about Kelley?

201
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:19,908
時間太長了  我只有些模糊的記憶
It's too long ago. I only have a vague memory.

202
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:24,202
他穿著得體  有南方的口音
He was well dressed and had a southern accent.

203
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:26,918
我實在是想不起來了
I truly don't remember.

204
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,791
好吧  醫生躺下休息會兒吧!
All right, Doc. Have a lie down.

205
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,502
我出去吃個牛肉漢堡
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.

206
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:37,256
也許你冷靜幾個小時會想起些新的東西來
Maybe a few hours cold turkey will refresh your memory.

207
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,807
小心點兒!
Watch yourself!

208
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:51,519
躺下睡一會兒
We're going to take a little nap, sit your ass down.

209
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,854
好好想一想
We're going to clear your mind.

210
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,525
我現在出去等我回來的時候  
I'm going out. When I get back,

211
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:00,778
我會從冰箱媯鳩A帶點好東西  好嗎?
I'll fix you some goodies from the icebox, alright?

212
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:05,282
把我想知道的告訴我  我就再也不會找你麻煩了
Tell me what I want to know and you'll get rid of me forever.

213
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,174
我回來了  醫生!我給你帶了些好東西!
I'm back, Doc! I brought you a little something!

214
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:51,140
我想你可能不會要漢堡包
I didn't think you'd want a cheeseburger...

215
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,512
我會的了!再見!
I will! Bye!

216
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:22,306
嗨  埃莉!
Hi, Ellie!

217
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:25,642
那個是你的男朋友嗎?
Is that your boyfriend?

218
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,021
他有輛車?
He's got a car and everything?

219
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,108
等會兒見!
See you later!

220
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,435
-你見到他了嗎?  -沒有
- Did you see him? - No.

221
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:14,132
為什麼沒有?
Why not?

222
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,146
-這事有點困難  -為什麼?
- It would've been difficult. - Why?

223
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,858
為什麼?因為他不在那
Why? Because he's not there.

224
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:24,403
強尼·菲佛瑞在12年前穿著他最好的衣服  
Johnny Favorite walked out of the clinic 1 2 years ago,

225
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:28,371
離開了那家醫院而且他的臉經過整容
in his best suit, with a new face wrapped in bandages...

226
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:30,034
走的時候還包著繃帶
and a headache.

227
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,369
他和一個叫開利的家夥一起離開的
He left with a guy called Kelley

228
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:36,373
還有一個女的  你認識這個開利嗎?
and a girl. Do you know this Kelley?

229
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,485
這個叫開利的付錢雇用一個
It seems this Kelley paid off some bent

230
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:42,545
叫福勒的醫生處理遺留問題
doctor called Fowler

231
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:47,382
這些年都是這個醫生在做手腳掩飾
to pinch hit for your guy. He's covered up for him all these years.

232
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,225
看來我們的強尼已很神秘地失蹤了  
Looks like our Johnny has

233
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:01,437
-看起來是這麼回事  -就是如此
- a perfect disappearing act. - It seems so.

234
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:06,108
你知道他們是怎麼形容蝸牛的嗎?
But you know what they say about slugs.

235
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:09,444
不知道  他們怎麼說?
No, what do they say about slugs?

236
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,364
蝸牛總是在它走的路上留下痕跡  粘液
They always leave slime in their tracks.

237
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,748
-你能找到他  -不  我不會去找他
- You'll find him. - No, I won't find him.

238
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,502
因為我遺漏一個小細節
Because I left out one little detail.

239
00:27:28,754 --> 00:27:30,880
這個福勒博士死了  
This Dr. Fowler ended up dead

240
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,175
腦漿四濺
with his fucking brains blown out.

241
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:39,305
-是你殺了他嗎?  -不是!
- Did you kill him? - No!

242
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:41,807
但是警察可能認為是我做的
But the cops might think I did.

243
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,104
我收你125塊一天  僅僅是幫你找個失蹤的人
I took on a $1 25-a-day missing persons job for you.

244
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:50,016
現在  我反倒成了一個謀殺嫌疑犯
Now, I'm a murder suspect.

245
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,316
到此為止!我不幹了
That's it! I'm out.

246
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:55,236
這些是在你的職業生涯中必然會遇到的危險  
Such are the hazards of your profession.

247
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:58,447
如果你覺得是價錢在困擾你的話  我還可以再加
If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.

248
00:27:58,906 --> 00:28:00,365
是你在煩擾我!
You bother me!

249
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:03,494
我對死亡感覺最接近的時候...
The closest I ever come to death...

250
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:07,313
也就僅僅是看著靈車從第二大街經過
is watching a hearse go by on 2nd Avenue.

251
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:09,291
我只能承受到這個程度
That's the way I like it.

252
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:12,376
你是害怕嗎?
Are you afraid?

253
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:15,713
是的  我很害怕
Yeah, I'm afraid.

254
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:20,383
我會通知我的律師馬上寄給你5千的支票.
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately to send you a check for $5,000.

255
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:24,888
如果你不想幹  我會找其他人
If you don't want the job, I'll engage someone else.

256
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:30,517
五千美元?
5,000?

257
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,816
你很想找到這個強尼  是嗎?
You want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?

258
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:41,194
我不喜歡我的帳目混亂
I don't like messy accounts.

259
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:51,704
一些宗教認為蛋是靈魂的象征  你知道嗎?
Some religions think the egg is the symbol of the soul, did you know that?

260
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,706
不知道
No.

261
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:01,379
你想要一個蛋嗎?
Would you like an egg?

262
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,678
不  謝謝你  我對雞過敏
No, thank you. I got a thing about chickens.

263
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,894
-過了十一點了  你遲到啦  -對不起
- It's after eleven, you're late. - I'm sorry.

264
00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:12,481

- You get it? - If I lose my job,

265
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,443
我會當你的秘書
I'll come and be your secretary.

266
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:18,713
我不可能付給你"泰晤士報"的薪資
I couldn't pay you what the "Times" pays.

267
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,698
此外  他們也不會讓你走
Besides, they won't miss it.

268
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,367
嗨  強尼  你到底是個什麼角色?
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?

269
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,107
他真的是一個憂鬱歌手
He really was a crooner,

270
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,330
像你說的  我沒想到他這麼有名
like you said. I didn't realize he was so big.

271
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,917
他曾在一個叫斯巴德·新普森的樂團工作  他們都死了
He was in a band called the Spider Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.

272
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:36,204
只有斯巴德還在這個城市
Only Spider is here in town.

273
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:38,505
-在哪?  -我全都寫在上面了
- Where? - I wrote it all down.

274
00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:40,548
檔案中的同性戀女子有些可疑
The dyke in the archive is suspicious.

275
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,927
我的老板有好多年都不看這些檔案了
My boss hasn't researched the story in years.

276
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:46,012
你可以把檔案拿走
You can get the files.

277
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:49,390
斯巴德現在在138大街的一個老人院中
Spider is in an old people's home on 1 38th Street.

278
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:52,809
唉  我又得去一次黑人區
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.

279
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:56,438
這有一張強尼和土斯·史威特的合影  一個吉他手
There was a picture of Johnny with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.

280
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:58,648
已經很多年沒人聽說過他了!
No one's heard of him for years!

281
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:01,150
強尼和一個很有錢的女人訂婚  
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,

282
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,488
瑪格麗特·克洛斯馬克  她爸爸擁有一半的路易斯安那
Margaret Krusemark. Her dad owns half of Louisiana.

283
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:09,540
他倆兒在一個中學舞會認識強尼和她扯上了
Met him at a high school prom. Johnny shit on her,

284
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:10,909
她就回去找她爸爸
and she went back to Daddy.

285
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,286
有很多和他們的符咒有關的事情
There's lots on their spells.

286
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:16,415
符咒  你說符咒是什麼意思?
Spells, what do you mean, spells?

287
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:19,542
就像蠑螈的眼睛  
The eye of a newt,

288
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:22,321
青蛙的腳趾...諸如此類的東西?
toe of a frog and that kind of shit?

289
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:23,420
她看起來有一點點怪
Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.

290
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,799
沒事會做些藥水...下下咒什麼的
Casting spells at society do's and stuff.

291
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:32,262
沒參加什麼組織嗎?
Didn't go down too well with the lvy League stiffos.

292
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:36,808
她在威爾斯萊利(位於紐約長島)是很出名的巫婆
She was known as the Witch of Wellesly.

293
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:39,852
我做的漂亮嗎?
Did I do good?

294
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,919
太棒了!看看我們有些什麼
Great! So what've I got

295
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,274
一個帶有宗教色彩像瘋子一樣的客戶
A religious loonie as a client.

296
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:48,607
我必須找到這個"金嗓子"強尼
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils"

297
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:49,820
而我們現在沒有一點頭緒
and we don't know where he is.

298
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:53,490
而他呢  可能連自己是誰都不知道
And he probably doesn't know who he is.

299
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:57,952
還有一個住在黑人區的--當過樂隊指揮的老家夥
I got a geriatric bandleader in a home in Harlem.

00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:01,330
一個叫土斯·史威特的吉他手
I got a guitar player called Toots Sweet.

301
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:03,332
我們還有什麼?
What else have I got?

302
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:05,083
迫切的希望?
A hard-on?

303
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:11,631
你沒事吧?
Are you okay?

304
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,458

attorneys. As reported, Johnny Favorite has not been

308
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:05,554
在波基普西的莎拉·多德醫院
in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in Poughkeepsie for the last 1 2 years.

309
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:10,517
他被一個叫愛德華·開利的男人和一個女人帶走
He was taken away by a man called Edward Kelley and a girl.

310
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:12,853
女的身份無法確認
The girl is unidentified.

311
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:17,023
開利付了2萬5給福勒醫生  
Kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25,000 to falsify reports

312
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:20,444
偽造強尼的住院紀錄..
stating that Favorite was still in the hospital.

313
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:29,117
醫生現在死了
The doctor is now deceased.

314
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:33,243
種種跡象顯示強尼在出意外前
Before Johnny's accident it seemed

315
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:34,372
事業正處於高峰期
like his career was going great,

316
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:37,426
一直到他開始遺棄他的支持者
until he started to dump on everyone.

317
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:39,836
我跟蹤記錄了斯巴德.新普森
I tracked down Spider Simpson,

318
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:43,339
強尼以前的樂隊指揮

320
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:51,638
強尼還有一個好朋友  一個叫土斯·史威特的吉他手
on 1 38th Street. Johnny also had a good buddy, a guitar player

321
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:55,391
土斯回阿爾及爾那堨h了
called Toots Sweet. Toots went back to Algiers.

322
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:59,562
是在新奧爾良的那個阿爾及爾
That's Algiers in New Orleans.

323
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:04,066
我估計瑪格麗特可能在那兒  有可能強尼也在那
I think maybe Margaret went back there, and maybe Johnny, too.

324
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:09,779
哦  對了!根據斯巴德描述  強尼還有個秘密情人
Oh, yeah! According to Spider, Johnny had a secret love.

00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,033
一位黑人女士  叫伊文捷琳·普勞德富特  
A black lady called Evangeline Proudfoot.

Evangeline ran some kind of spooky store in Harlem

327
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,499
店名叫"曼寧卡特"
called "Mammy Carter's."

328
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:31,716
你不需要知道這些  賽佛我想..
You don't need to know that, Cyphre. I think

329
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:35,553
秘密的情人就讓她維持秘密吧
a secret love should stay secret.

330
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:38,263
有一個人  
The only person

331
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,891
強尼每隔一段時間就會去找他  
who Johnny was seeing regularly

332
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,228
一個住在長島上(位於紐約)的叫卓拉夫人的看手相的人
was a palm reader in Coney lsland called Madame Zora.

333
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:08,124
你是  易茲嗎?
Are you lzzy?

334
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:13,045
-是的  -正在欣賞夕陽  嗯?
- Yes. - Looks like the last bit of sun, eh?

走廊堛漕滬茪H說也許你能幫到我  
The guy in the arcade over there told me you might be able to help me.

336
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:21,360
我正在找  卓拉夫人
I'm looking for Madame Zora.

337
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:24,055
我知道她  戰前我老婆的朋友
I know her, friend of the wife before the war.

338
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:27,892

- She was a fortune teller, right? - And then some!

339
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:32,938

I hate those hocus-pocus bitches! Her and the wife got along real well.

Wife's a baptist. Oh, here!

341
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,067
給鼻子帶個套兒!

342
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:43,573
沒事的  拿一個  我在走道塈鋮鴗F一大盒
Go on, take one. I found a whole boxful under the boardwalk.

343
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,741
現在陽光不是很猛
There's not much sun right now.

344
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,910
是的  但是也不會下雨

Heard of him, but don't know nothing. Ask the wife.

348
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,266
她總是跟著收音機唱些難聽的歌
She always sings stupid tunes off the radio.

349
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:03,674
她對這些東西很了解
She knows all that shit.

350
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,552
-她喜歡水  嗯?  -不  她討厭它
- She likes the water, eh? - She hates it.

她正在做運動  她認為這些對她的靜脈曲張有好處
She's getting on the heavy side. She thinks it's good for varicose veins.

我剛和你的丈夫聊過
I was just talking to your husband.

358
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:46,546
我正在打聽關於卓拉夫人的事  
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.

359
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,662
是的  我在戰前就認識她

361
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:53,010
是的  她是一個有錢的吉普賽手相家!
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!

362
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:59,183
在我家隔壁開了個店  她肯定不是吉普賽人
Had the booth across the boardwalk from me. She was a debutante not a gypsy,

363
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:02,060
而且她不僅僅只會看手相
and she did more than just read tea leaves.

364
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:07,214
你見過她和一個叫強尼·菲佛瑞的人在一起過嗎?  
Did you ever see her with a guy called Johnny Favorite?

365
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:08,942
見過  他很可愛

她被他迷住了  人們都叫他"金嗓子"
She was stuck on him. He was called "Golden Tonsils".

367
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:14,780
我聽過他所有的歌
I knew all his tunes.

368
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,742
那你聽說過一個叫瑪格麗特·克洛斯馬克的人嗎?

Don't be a gazoony, fellah!

370
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:23,497
卓拉夫人就是瑪格麗特·克洛斯馬克
Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.

371
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:26,833
好的  她怎麼樣了?

收拾東西回她南方的老家去了
Packed up her stuff and went back home, down south.

想要聽到他的其中一首歌曲嗎?
Want to hear one of his tunes?

376

謝謝你的鼻子套  我去的地方正好要用到它
Thanks for the nose shield. I'm going to need it where I'm going.

377
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:55,230
布魯克林?
In Brooklyn?

378
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,820
-不  是路易斯安那(美國南部一州)  -好極了
- Louisiana. - Nice.

379
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:01,614

Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting, but you're a little early.

382
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:04,377
我的電話不是很清楚
I had a bad line.

383
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:07,407
沒聽清你說的是4:00還是4:30.
I didn't know if you said 4:00 or 4:30.

384
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:16,499
-真是個好地方!  -是的  我在這塈b得很開心
- This is a wild place you got here! - Yes, I've been very happy here.

385
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:20,419
我以前從沒看過相  要花很長時間嗎?
I've never had my fortune read before. Does it take long?

-烏龍茶  -很少人喜歡烏龍茶
- Not many people like oolong.

392
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:01,790
你會彈鋼琴嗎?
Do you play the piano?

393
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,459
不  不是很懂
No, not exactly.

394
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,003
唱歌呢?
Sing?

395
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,174
我能唱兩句  但是不...不好聽
I can carry a tune, but no...not really.

396
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:18,263
這個難看的家夥是誰?
Who is this mean looking guy?

397

沒事  他也不喜歡這張照片

403
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:51,836

就這樣挺好  謝謝你

408
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:07,600
我需要你准確的出生日期
I need your exact date of birth.

409
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:09,601
當然!
Sure!

410
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:14,064
我在2月14日出生...
I was born on February 14th...

411
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:21,529
...1918年  剛好是情人節
...1918, on Valentine's day.

412
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:28,118
很有意思!我以前認識個人也在這天出生
How curious! I used to know a boy who was born on that exact same day.

413
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:33,956
是嗎  你知道了  所有士兵的家都在
Well, you know how it is, all the soldiers home on leave and all.

414
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,245
也許我們可以把你這個朋友的圖表拿出來用
Maybe we could pull your friend's chart...

415
00:46:37,246 --> 00:46:38,586
省的浪費時間
and save ourselves some time.

416
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:43,674
我不這麼認為  每個人都是不一樣的
I don't think so. Every person is very different. I don't think

417
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:46,093
我想你也不會喜歡他的圖表

你可以這麼說
You could say that.

421
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,565
我猜你們可能相處得不好
I guess you didn't get along.

422
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,900
你和強尼

423

我想你們兩個是那種...
I thought you two were kinda...

426
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:30,681
好吧  我不是他的戰友
Look, I ain't no army buddy,

427
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,760
我只是個受雇找尋資料的人
I'm just a guy who was paid to snoop around.

428
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,305
說實話  我不是情人節那天生的
To tell the truth, I wasn't born on Valentine's day.

429
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:40,100
我只對強尼的未來感興趣
It's Johnny's future I'm interested in.

430
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,311
強尼沒有未來  他死了
Johnny has no future, he's dead.

431
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,480
他12年前就死了  我想你該走了
He died 1 2 years ago. I'd like you to leave.

432
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,085
我知道你肯定在想...
I know you're thinking...

433
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:52,236
這個偷偷摸摸到處刺探消息的人是誰?
who is this creep poking his snitch in everything.

434
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:55,486
我不想讓你感覺我太多管閑事  但是...
I don't want to sound nosy, but...

435
00:47:55,487 --> 00:47:56,948
他死了  安卓先生
He's dead, Mr. Angel.

436
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:59,785
即使她沒死  在我心堨L也是死的
And if he isn't, he is to me.

437
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:03,705
他肯定把你傷害得很深!
He must've hurt you pretty bad!

438
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:06,374
我們每個人都有自己的傷心事
We all have our scars.

439
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,231
我對這個家夥不是很了解
I don't know too much about the guy,

440
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:11,629
但是  他離開你實在是太蠢了
but he must've been stupid to let you go.

441
00:48:12,088 --> 00:48:16,175
謊言和殘忍對某些人來說是很容易的
Lies and cruelty come very easily to some people.

442
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:20,387
很遺憾  我真的希望你能幫我看看手相
Pity, I really would've liked to have gotten my palm read.

443
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:23,932
那樣我就可以把你的手多握一會兒
Then I could have held your hand just a little longer.

444
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:29,144
我不認為你會喜歡我看見的事情
I don't think you'd like what I see.

445
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:33,732
非常漂亮的項鏈!
Very pretty necklace!

446
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:10,848
你有沒有很爽啊  強尼!

- the Conquerer root? - Powdered or hanging?

448
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:16,020
我也不知道
I'm not really sure.

449
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:17,730
被雨淋的咳嗽了  嗯?
Caught in the rain, eh?

450
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:24,069
二個草藥根  1塊2
Two roots, $1 .20.

451
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:32,326
順便問一下  我在黑人區有個熟人
I have a question. I had an acquaintance in Harlem

452
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:34,620
她過去也是賣這些的

453

Practically everyone around here is called Evangeline. After the poem.

455
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:42,836
你聽說過那首詩嗎?
Do you know it?

456
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:46,214
是的  我知道它
Yeah, I know it.

457
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:49,463
這個熟人在黑人住宅區中有一間商店
This acquaintance had a store in Harlem...

458
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:50,384

00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:53,346
-"卡特"  -每個人都用這個名字  先生
- "Carter." - Everybody uses the name, mister.

460
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:56,515
就像"華德·強森"  但是這堣~是正宗
Like "Howard Johnson," but this is the real place.

461
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:58,850
她的名字是普勞德富特  
Her name was Proudfoot.

我認識她  她住在紐約的時候經常回來
I knew her. She used to come back all the time when she lived in New York.

00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:12,655
-你知道她現在哪媔?  -她生病死了
- Do you know where she is now? - She got sick and died.

465
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:14,498
她回到了神的庇護所
She went back to the Holy Shelter swamp...

466

467
00:50:17,034 --> 00:50:19,115
她正在等候某些人

我想和你媽媽聊一會兒

I'm not after him. I'm just being paid to find out where he is.

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,853
可以請你喝一杯嗎?
Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?

519
00:57:06,313 --> 00:57:08,815
不用了  今天老板請客特制雞尾酒
Mine's on the house. Special cocktail.

520
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:11,317
別管堶惟韙F什麼  先喝一大杯再說
Whatever's in it gives a big kick.

521
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:15,696
你知道嗎  幾年前我在紐約看過你表演
You know, I heard you play years ago in New York.

522
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:19,908
戰前在老  迪基·威爾斯酒吧
Before the war at the old Dickie Wells Bar.

523
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:25,788
你和一個  叫強尼·菲佛瑞的家夥合作表演得不錯
You were having it up pretty good with a guy called Johnny Favorite.

524
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:30,751
-是的  我都快忘了  -你和他是好朋友  是嗎?
- Yeah, I vaguely remember. - You and he were buddies, weren't you?

525
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,963
不是  他錄了我的其中一支歌  你是星探還是作家?
No, he recorded one of my songs. Say, are you a dick or a book writer?

526
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:38,635
都不是  我是一個新聞記者
Neither. I'm a journalist

527
00:57:38,636 --> 00:57:40,594
我正在寫一些關於...
and I'm doing this piece

528
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:44,389
強尼和斯巴德·新普森  管弦樂隊的文章
about Johnny and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.

529
00:57:44,848 --> 00:57:47,683
斯巴德打起鼓來就像兩只長耳朵大野兔在性交!
Spider played them drums like two jackrabbits fucking!

530
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,937
我沒有太多的時間要先去小個便  然後還要回去工作
Haven't got much time. Got to piss, spit and get back to work.

531
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:56,441
試一下這些雞尾酒  喝完後你就隨便編個故事
Try one of those cocktails. Then you can make the whole thing up as you like.

532
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,569
反正你們平常都是這麼幹的
That's what you usually do, anyway.

533
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:23,048
我連小個便都不行嗎!
I can't even take a piss!

534
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:24,852
我只是想談談關於...  
I just wanted to talk about...

535
00:58:24,853 --> 00:58:27,094
強尼·菲佛瑞和伊文捷琳·普勞德富特的事
Johnny Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.

536
00:58:27,553 --> 00:58:31,556
我什麼都沒隱瞞  卻是一無所知
I'm too big to go hiding under beds. I don't know nothing.

537
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:33,766
我只對雞尾酒感興趣  他媽的!
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!

538
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:49,943
怎麼回事?
What's going on?

539
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:52,908
沒事!管好你自己  我只想撒尿!
Nothing! Mind your own business. I want to piss!

540
00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:55,912
滾出去  
Get outta here,

541
00:58:56,371 --> 00:58:59,540
否則的話你會後悔被生出來
or you'll wish your little white ass was never born.

542
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:02,167
拜托!我對雞有些敏感
Please! I've got a thing about chickens.

543
01:03:04,262 --> 01:03:06,680
不要再和我胡說八道了!
End of bullshit time!

544
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:09,432
我看得清清楚楚...
I've had a good look at you and young Epiphany

545
01:03:10,225 --> 01:03:12,852
你和艾普芙尼一起用雞搞那些祭祀
doing your hot shoe number with the chicken.

546
01:03:13,312 --> 01:03:14,729
聽清楚!
Listen!

547
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:18,023
我才不信這些伏都教的鬼法術  我來自布魯克林
I ain't up on this voodoo shit. I'm from Brooklyn.

548
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:20,177
我們都不是虔誠的教徒
We ain't all Baptists here.

549
01:03:20,178 --> 01:03:22,861
這個姓普勞德富特的姑娘到底是幹什麼的?
What's with this Proudfoot girl?

550
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:24,977
她是一個曼波女祭司
She's a mambo priestess,

551
01:03:24,978 --> 01:03:27,324
和她的媽媽一樣  從她13歲開始就是
like her mom. Has been since she was 1 3.

552
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:30,535
你上一次看見強尼·菲佛瑞和雞跳這些怪舞是什麼時候?
When was the last time you saw Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?

553
01:03:30,994 --> 01:03:35,081
-他那時經常圍著她媽媽轉  -我在戰前就沒見過他
- He used to run around with Ma mambo. - I ain't seen him since before the war.

554
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,571
那廁所堛甄腳是什麼意思?
And the chicken foot in the john?

555
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:40,169
那是警告我嘴太快了
It means I got a big mouth.

556
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:44,006
還不夠快  你嘴堛滌閂P星是什麼東西?
It's not big enough. What's this fucking star

557
01:03:44,465 --> 01:03:46,842
我告訴你
in your mouth? I'll tell you what.

558
01:03:48,176 --> 01:03:50,315
我把旅店的電話號碼告訴你
I'll give you my hotel number.

559
01:03:50,316 --> 01:03:53,347
你打聽到什麼事就給我打個電話
Gimme a call if you hear anything.

560
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,393
你要知道  
You never know.

561
01:03:57,852 --> 01:04:01,271
下次你再收到一個雞腳的話  你可能需要幫忙
Next time you get a delivery of a chicken foot, you might need help.

562
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:06,817
我最關心的是  死雞才是個好雞
As far as I'm concerned, any dead chicken is a good chicken.

563
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:57,167
只有警察和壞消息從不敲門
Only cops and bad news don't knock.

564
01:05:57,627 --> 01:05:59,545
只有私人偵探總睡懶覺
Only private dicks sleep late.

565
01:06:00,254 --> 01:06:05,341
-你正在做一個好夢!  -我正在去曼德勒路上
- Quite a dream you were having! - I was on my way to Mandalay.

566
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,931
他媽的!你這兒的天花漏了!
Shit! There's some leak up there!

567
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:14,642
這兒!這是你的名字嗎?
Here! ls this your name?

568
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,946
你住的旅館?
That your hotel?

569
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:31,449
-就是現在這  不是嗎?  -你的筆跡?
- You're standing in it, ain't you? - Your handwriting?

570
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,076
我想是的
I think so.

571
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,121
那也許你能告訴我們...
Then perhaps you can tell us why we found it in the hand

572
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:40,541
為什麼我們在一個死的吉他手的手媯o現這些
of a dead guitar player.

573
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:46,004
土斯·史威特死了?
Toots Sweet is dead?

574
01:06:49,132 --> 01:06:51,759
這家夥花了很長時間才死的
This one wasn't so quick, this one took time.

575
01:06:52,218 --> 01:06:53,635
他怎麼死的?
How did he die?

576
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:58,348
技術上說?他被自己的生殖器給憋死了
Technically? Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.

577
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:01,101
實際上呢?
And not so technically?

578
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,395
有人切掉了他的生殖器並塞進了他的嘴
They cut his dick off and choked him with it.

579
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,898
然後用他的血把他家重裝飾了一遍
Then redecorated his apartment with his blood.

580
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,234
你何時見過他?
When did you see him?

581
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,988
-1:00左右  -談了些什麼?
- I interviewed him around 1 :00. - About what?

582
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,948
一個失蹤的人
A missing person.

583
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,366
誰?
Who?

584
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,494
一個12年前離家出走的人
A guy who took a walk 1 2 years ago.

585
01:07:21,953 --> 01:07:23,601
有他和土斯的一張相片
There was a photo of him and Toots.

586
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:25,414
你正在找的人是誰?
Who is the party you're looking for?

587
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:29,418
我不能說  我正在為一位紐約的律師工作
I can't say. I'm working for a New York lawyer.

588
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:32,587
-名字?  -好了  哥們兒!
- Name? - Come on, man!

589
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:36,091
瓦恩薩普!你想要他的電話  地址嗎?
Winesap! You want his number, his address?

590
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,219
去問泰絲·特魯哈特  在他看的那個本子
Ask Tess Truehart over there, it's in the book.

591
01:07:39,678 --> 01:07:41,517
在"W"下面  天才!
Under "W," genius!

592
01:07:41,518 --> 01:07:44,348
你認識泰德.威廉斯  那個棒球運動員?
Do you know Ted Williams, the baseball player?

593
01:07:51,313 --> 01:07:53,815
好吧  就這樣行了吧?
Alright, is that it, guys?

594
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:57,277
好了
That's it.

595
01:07:58,695 --> 01:08:02,907
你可以去吃午餐  但不要走得太遠
You can go eat lunch, but don't stroll too far.

596
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:05,576
等我們和這個律師談完再說
Not until we talk to this lawyer.

597
01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:16,627
看過那部"米老鼠俱樂部"嗎?
Ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club?"

598
01:08:18,671 --> 01:08:21,298
你知道今天是星期幾嗎?
Do you know what today is?

599
01:08:21,757 --> 01:08:24,009
今天是星期三
Today is Wednesday.

600
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,970
是"任何事都可能發生"的日子
It's "anything can happen" day.

601
01:09:56,677 --> 01:09:57,969
嗨  你想要聽歌嗎?
Hey man, do you want a tune?

602
01:10:00,889 --> 01:10:03,057
好吧  我來點首歌
Yeah, I got a tune for you.

603
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,842
你好  小夥子們!
Hiya, boys!

604
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,596
我肚子有點餓
Same to you. I'm getting kinda hungry.

605
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,098
可以賣給我一些嗎?
Do you want to sell some of those?

606
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:49,149
-10仙一袋  -好的  給我一袋
- 10 cents a sack. - Sure, give me a sack.

607
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,040
聽好了!瑪格麗特·克洛斯馬克的老爸
Listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old man...

608
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,593
希望你坐第一班火車回家
wants you on the first train home.

609
01:15:19,052 --> 01:15:20,886
把那個狗東西拿開!
Take that fucking thing away from me!

610
01:15:21,346 --> 01:15:25,015
如果你不走  這只狗會把你的臉吃掉
Don't, or the dog will bite your fucking face clean off.

611
01:15:51,206 --> 01:15:52,999
你發生了什麼事?
What happened to you?

612
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,376
一只狗咬了我
A dog bit me.

613
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:57,837
那  你想要什麼?
So, what do you want?

614
01:15:59,297 --> 01:16:01,674
現在  我想把衣服洗一下
Right now, I need a laundry.

615
01:16:04,468 --> 01:16:07,095
-聽我說  艾普芙尼...  -艾普芙尼
- Listen, Epiphiny...- Epiphany.

616
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:09,806
有件事我想問你
There's something I want to ask you.

617
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:15,686
有一天晚上我看見你和土斯拿著公雞在跳舞
The other night I saw you and Toots boogying with the cock-a-doodle.

618
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,147
看上去好像在進行一個舞會
Looked like you were having some party.

619
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:21,567
你看不慣嗎?這是一個自由的國家
What's your problem? It's a free country.

620
01:16:22,025 --> 01:16:25,444
-只要不是雞就行  -哦是的  你對雞過敏
- Not for chickens. - Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.

621
01:16:25,904 --> 01:16:28,322
聽我說  土斯是...
Listen, Toots is...

622
01:16:28,782 --> 01:16:31,159
-土斯死了  -我知道  我聽說了
- Toots is dead. - I know, I heard.

623
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:34,286
-是你害了他  -不  我沒有
- You set him up. - No, I didn't.

624
01:16:34,745 --> 01:16:37,872
只有你知道我見過土斯.
You were the only one that knew I was seeing Toots.

625
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,626
是你送的那個雞腳  是不是?
You sent the gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?

626
01:16:42,085 --> 01:16:44,253
土斯的嘴太快了
Toots had a big mouth.

627
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:48,007
我想是的  猜猜警察在他嘴媯o現了什麼
I guess he did, judging by what the cops found in it.

628
01:16:48,466 --> 01:16:49,770
真是個可愛的宗教!
Quite a cute religion!

629
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,511
用釘子把人釘在十字架上也不是很可愛嗎!
Nailing a man to a cross ain't so cute either!

630
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:54,888
你一定要殺雞去做湯  嗯?
You've got to kill the chicken to make the soup, eh?

631
01:16:55,347 --> 01:16:57,417
我們並不會整天去謀害別人
We don't go around murdering people.

632
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:00,351
你那個強尼·菲佛瑞又怎麼樣呢?
What about your Johnny Favorite?

633
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:05,564
-現在你記起他來了  -是的  他是我的父親
- Now you remember him after all. - Yes, he was my father.

634
01:17:12,488 --> 01:17:13,945
我等會兒來接他  好嗎?
I'll pick the baby up later, okay?

635
01:17:13,946 --> 01:17:15,282
放心吧  他沒事的
He'll be all right.

636
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:20,370
以前你隱瞞的事  現在正是講出來的好機會
Anything you're holding out, now is a good time to tell.

637
01:17:20,829 --> 01:17:21,829
我沒什麼好說的
Nothing to tell.

638
01:17:23,122 --> 01:17:25,791
強尼沒有從戰場上回來
Johnny never came back from the war.

639
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:30,503
媽媽滿懷憂愁  孤單的一直等到死
Mama waited and Mama died. Sad and simple.

640
01:17:31,672 --> 01:17:36,134
這埵漯漱H太多了...
There's too many dead bodies floating around, even for Louisiana.

641
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,846
我會告訴你丈夫好好照顧你  
I'd tell your old man to look out for you.

642
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:43,015
-你有丈夫吧?  -沒有
- You do have a husband? - No.

643
01:17:43,474 --> 01:17:44,600
沒有?
No?

644
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:47,602
天哪  你的眼睛真漂亮!
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!

645
01:17:48,437 --> 01:17:50,271
真的  不騙你
Really.

646
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,318
這種眼睛會把心媟Q的都說出來
The kind of eyes that tell what's going on inside.

647
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:58,279
-現在  你被嚇壞了  -我能應付
- Right now, you're scared. - I'll manage.

648
01:18:01,616 --> 01:18:04,660
-聽著...  -知道了  我有消息會打電話給你的
- Listen...- Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.

649
01:18:08,247 --> 01:18:10,290
有沒有都要打給我
Call me if you don't.

650
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:12,625
好嗎?
Alright?

651
01:18:35,313 --> 01:18:37,898
這有你一個短信
I have a message for you.

652
01:18:43,946 --> 01:18:45,489
-謝謝你  -不客氣
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

653
01:19:44,584 --> 01:19:48,545
-我很高興你能來  -我不知道你也在這
- I'm so glad you could come. - I didn't know you were in town.

654
01:19:49,004 --> 01:19:51,443
我正在賽佛魯治(位於洛杉磯)演講
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge...

655
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:53,883
突然想了解你進展得怎麼樣?
and thought I'd catch up on your progress.

656
01:19:54,343 --> 01:19:56,052
我會告訴你的  
I'll tell you,

657
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:58,721
進展不太好
the progress ain't too good.

658
01:19:59,514 --> 01:20:01,929
到目前為止  我發現了很多東西
I've found out a lot of stuff,

659
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,184
但就是沒有強尼·菲佛瑞
but so far...no Johnny Favorite.

660
01:20:05,603 --> 01:20:06,444
真不好運!
How unfortunate!

661
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:09,981
現在所掌握的全是一些零碎沒用的和...
All I've got is a belly full of hocus-pocus and...

662
01:20:11,024 --> 01:20:12,024
三具僵硬的...
3 stiffs.

663
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:16,278
屍體  賽佛先生
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.

664
01:20:16,654 --> 01:20:17,654
謀殺
Murders.

665
01:20:21,826 --> 01:20:26,371
福勒  強尼的醫生  自殺了
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor, bumped himself off.

666
01:20:26,914 --> 01:20:29,499
老伏都教徒土斯·史威特  
This old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.

667
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:33,878
被自己身上用來小便的東西給憋死了...
He got choked to death with a part of the body meant for pissing with...

668
01:20:34,838 --> 01:20:36,089
這是教堂!
This is a church!

669
01:20:38,549 --> 01:20:44,053
這些事都和一個宗教有關  非常怪異
The whole thing has to do with religion. It's very weird.

670
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,181
我不了解它  它很嚇人
I don't understand it. It's ugly.

671
01:20:47,683 --> 01:20:52,312
有人說已經有足夠多的宗教讓人學會仇恨  而不是愛
They say there's enough religion to make men hate each other but not love.

672
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:53,812
有人這麼說嗎?
Do they say that?

673
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:59,485
我告訴你  強尼·菲佛瑞的周圍可沒那麼多愛
I'll tell you something. There wasn't much love around for Johnny Favorite.

674
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:01,612
他運氣不好!
He was bad luck!

675
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:06,533
我已是惹禍上身了  我現在是兩宗謀殺案的嫌疑人
It's starting to rub off on me. I'm a murder suspect already in two cases.

676
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:10,620
警察在土斯·史威特的手媯o現了我的名字和地址
The police found my name and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.

677
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:13,518
我知道  瓦恩薩普告訴我了
I know, Winesap told me.

678
01:21:13,519 --> 01:21:15,958
你一定要小心  安卓先生
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.

679
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:18,835
第三個謀殺案呢?
And the third murder?

680
01:21:19,294 --> 01:21:21,692
我查了強尼過去的一個女朋友
I checked out Johnny's old society girlfriend,

681
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:24,090
瑪格麗特·克洛斯馬克
Margaret Krusemark.

682
01:21:24,591 --> 01:21:27,176
-你認識她嗎?  -有點印象
- Do you know her? - Vaguely.

683
01:21:27,635 --> 01:21:31,555
有點印象?我受夠了這種含糊其辭
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up with fucking vaguely.

684
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:35,893
這種含糊的用詞快把我逼瘋了  說老實話...
"Vaguely" is putting a noose around my neck and I'm choking, so...

685
01:21:36,352 --> 01:21:38,979
你到底認不認識她?
Did you know her or not?

686
01:21:39,688 --> 01:21:42,565
我聽說過她  但是我沒實際接觸過
I knew about her, but I never actually knew her.

687
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:45,609
告訴你  她正在給我做圖表
Tell you what, she was doing my chart.

688
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:49,321
我給了她強尼的生日  2月14日
I gave her Johnny's birthday, February 14th.

689
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:54,951
然而有人到她那  帶著自己的情人節卡片
Except someone got to her and took out their own Valentine's card.

690
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:59,122
他們開了她的膛  挖了她的心
They slit her open and cut out her heart.

691
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,293
我想她連自己的未來也無法預測
I guess she couldn't predict the future for herself.

692
01:22:04,752 --> 01:22:07,129
未來並不是想像的那樣
The future isn't what it used to be.

693
01:22:07,588 --> 01:22:09,506
-你的結論呢?  -我沒有任何結論
- And your conclusions? - I haven't any.

694
01:22:09,965 --> 01:22:13,509
我所知道的就是強尼正在給他認識的每一個人惹麻煩
All I know is that Johnny is running around bumping off everyone he knew.

695
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:17,180
而且越來越多  在中間牽線搭橋的正是我
And more and more, it's me who's on the line for it.

696
01:22:17,639 --> 01:22:18,994
我正在落入其中的圈套
I'm being set up...

697
01:22:18,995 --> 01:22:20,558
而且這些事把我嚇得膽都快破了!
and it's scaring the shit out of me.

698
01:22:21,017 --> 01:22:23,332
所以...請你幹脆實話告訴我
So why don't you just level with me and tell me...

699
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:25,104
這堥鴝野L媽的是怎麼回事?
what the fuck is going on?

700
01:22:26,022 --> 01:22:29,110
沒別的  我只是想找回強尼·菲佛瑞
Just Johnny Favorite...

701
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,192
和他欠我的債務
and the debt that's owed to me.

702
01:22:30,651 --> 01:22:33,737
我在個人榮譽方面思想很保守  
I have old-fashioned ideas, about honour.

703
01:22:34,196 --> 01:22:37,031
以牙還牙  以眼還眼  就這麼簡單
An eye for an eye, things like that.

704
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:40,492
你他媽到的是幹什麼的?
Who the fuck are you?

705
01:22:40,952 --> 01:22:42,203
注意你的用詞!
Watch your language!

706
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:47,624
我他媽的才不管這麼多  管他媽的什麼教堂
I don't give a fuck, if this is a church.

707
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:50,251
-我不喜歡教堂  -你是一個無神論者嗎?
- I don't like churches. - Are you an atheist?

708
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:53,713
是的  我來自布魯克林
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.

709
01:22:56,299 --> 01:22:57,925
我會在這塈b一兩天
I'll be in town for a day or two,

710
01:22:57,926 --> 01:22:59,551
找到什麼新線索及時通知我
let me know what else you find,

711
01:23:00,011 --> 01:23:02,263
-如果你缺錢的話...  -不缺!
- and if you need more money...- No!

712
01:23:02,721 --> 01:23:05,765
但是如果我不小心的話  你給我的五千塊錢  
But if I'm not careful, that 5,000 bucks you gave me could

713
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:09,102
將會在電椅上給我買一個位子
buy me a seat on the electric chair.

714
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:50,139
受驚嚇的眼睛不會說謊
Frightened eyes never lie.

715
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:53,350
來吧!進來!
Come on! Come inside!

716
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:04,527
-你的孩子呢?  -他在蜜西那埵o會帶著他
- Where's your child? - He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.

717
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:08,072
他自己也有個14歲的孩子  他在那兒沒事的
She's got 14 of her own, so he'll be okay there.

718
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:13,452
你可以呆在這  或者我再另外開個房間給你
You're welcome to stay here, or I can get you a room.

719
01:24:13,911 --> 01:24:15,370
不用了  這兒挺好
No, it's okay.

720
01:24:15,829 --> 01:24:19,081
我想喝一杯  你要嗎?
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?

721
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:23,294
好吧  隨便來一杯
Well, have one anyway.

722
01:24:27,215 --> 01:24:29,300
我有想...
I've been thinking...

723
01:24:29,759 --> 01:24:34,096
你媽媽到底看上強尼·菲佛瑞他什麼了?
What the hell did your mother see in a guy like Johnny Favorite?

724
01:24:34,555 --> 01:24:38,433
我不知道  不管他有什麼  她把心全交給他了
I don't know. Whatever he had, it sure stole her heart away.

725
01:24:39,434 --> 01:24:42,144
實話告訴你  這家夥是個卑鄙小人
To tell you the truth, the guy was a creep.

726
01:24:42,603 --> 01:24:44,938
她肯定很想他
She sure missed him.

727
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:51,111
一位淑女怎麼會喜歡  這樣一個到處搞事的壞家夥?
What does a lady see in a guy who runs around chopping up pigeons?

728
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:56,449
人們常說  男人不壞  女人不愛
They say it's always the bad-asses who make a girl's heart beat faster.

729
01:24:59,369 --> 01:25:01,537
她以前說過關於他的事嗎?
Did she ever say anything about him?

730
01:25:04,415 --> 01:25:07,042
-只談過兩件事  -什麼?
- Just two things. - What?

731
01:25:08,919 --> 01:25:14,048
那個強尼·菲佛瑞和她想像中的魔鬼一模一樣
That Johnny Favorite was as close to true evil as she ever wanted to come.

732
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:16,550
另一件呢?
What else?

733
01:25:17,385 --> 01:25:18,969
他是一個令人感到恐怖的情人
That he was a terrific lover.

734
01:25:24,433 --> 01:25:25,809
你多大了?
How old are you?

735
01:25:26,268 --> 01:25:28,645
十七
17.

736
01:25:30,689 --> 01:25:32,565
這麼小就有孩子  太年輕了吧?
Kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?

737
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:35,317
足夠大了
Old enough.

738
01:25:36,986 --> 01:25:39,613
-孩子他爸去哪堣F?  -我從沒見過他
- Where did the father go? - I never knew him.

739
01:25:40,531 --> 01:25:41,865
對不起
I'm sorry.

740
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:46,286
我不知道為什麼選了這個房間
I don't know why I took this room.

741
01:25:47,412 --> 01:25:50,539
難以想像!
I can't believe this!

742
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:53,575
在這個地方當精靈擁有過你  
It was a Bambouche. When spirits possess you,

743
01:25:53,576 --> 01:25:56,503
大家都把這叫做"chevalier(神交)"
it's called "chevalier."

744
01:25:56,879 --> 01:26:00,090
我知道:Chevrolet(雪佛來)
I know that: Chevrolet.

745
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,192
"chevalier(神交)"  
Chevalier.

746
01:26:03,193 --> 01:26:05,532
我就是這麼說的:Chevrolet(雪佛來)
That's what I said: Chevrolet.

747
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:06,346
被神觸摸過
Mounted by the gods.

748
01:26:07,055 --> 01:26:11,642
原來是神讓你懷孕的?我現在知道了對不起
So the gods got you pregnant? I understand now. I'm sorry.

749
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:14,144
實際上我不是的  那次是我做愛最舒服的一次
I'm not. It was the best fuck I ever had.

750
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,249
想跳舞嗎?
Want to dance?

751
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:40,335
在這兒?
Here?

752
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:42,003
是的  就在這兒
Yes, here.

753
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:51,344
我今天早上被狗咬了一口  行動有些困難
I got bit by a dog this morning, I can't move around.

754
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,598
你會感覺不到在動
You won't feel a thing.

755
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,726
好的  我可以和你跳舞
Alright, I'll dance with you.

756
01:26:59,477 --> 01:27:00,437
但是你必須答應我
But you've got to promise.

757
01:27:00,438 --> 01:27:02,146
-什麼?  -不要再拿雞來嚇唬我!
- What's that? - No chickens!

758
01:30:35,965 --> 01:30:38,133
好啦  我來了!
Alright, I'm coming!

759
01:30:40,261 --> 01:30:42,429
我應聽得出是誰這樣敲門
I should've recognised the knock.

760
01:30:42,888 --> 01:30:45,431
這次睡懶覺倒有個好理由
At least you got a reason for sleeping late.

761
01:30:45,891 --> 01:30:50,019
在這兒我們從不和黑人亂搞  這樣就不會出現混血兒
Down here we don't mess with jigaboos. The colored folks keep to themselves.

762
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:54,022
-我不是你們這兒的人  -你把自己割傷了?
- I'm not from down here. - You cut yourself?

763
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:55,482
狗咬了我一口
Dog bit me.

764
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:57,710
你查的這件案子
Somebody called Margaret Krusemark figure

765
01:30:57,711 --> 01:31:00,028
有個叫瑪格麗特·克洛斯馬克的人嗎?
in your missing persons case?

766
01:31:01,405 --> 01:31:02,749
沒有  怎麼了?
No, why?

767
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,991
她死了  那個黑人吉他手
She's dead. That nigger guitar player of yours,

768
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:08,533
他算不了什麼  他是個伏都教徒
he didn't matter a shit. He was into voodoo,

769
01:31:08,534 --> 01:31:10,246
反正每個星期都有人死
they 86 each other every week.

770
01:31:10,705 --> 01:31:12,391
但是這位克洛斯馬克夫人
But this Krusemark dame,

771
01:31:12,392 --> 01:31:15,375
她來自路易斯安那一個有錢人的家庭  白人家庭
she comes from a Louisiana money family.

772
01:31:15,834 --> 01:31:18,628
一星期內死了兩個人  中間有什麼聯系嗎?
Two people bumped off in a week, what's the connection?

773
01:31:19,087 --> 01:31:21,088
死亡現場很相似!
Similar circumstances!

774
01:31:21,548 --> 01:31:23,966
-她的生殖器也被切下來了嗎?  -不是!
- Did she have her dick cut off too? - No!

775
01:31:24,426 --> 01:31:25,907
那個混蛋把她的心挖了出來
Some fucker cut her heart out,

776
01:31:25,908 --> 01:31:27,178
手腳很幹淨  就像個屠夫
neat as a butcher.

777
01:31:27,637 --> 01:31:30,889
我在找的是個失蹤的人  不是個殺人犯
Look, mine's a missing persons, it's not a murder.

778
01:31:31,348 --> 01:31:35,852
-我想知道你找的這些人的名單  -你去對律師說吧
- I want the name of the party you're looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.

779
01:31:36,311 --> 01:31:38,322
我說了那個自負的家夥
I did. A fancy mouthpiece,

780
01:31:38,323 --> 01:31:41,107
像你一樣用大城市的那一套鬼話來敷衍我
gave me the same big city shit as you.

781
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:45,987
你讓我怎麼說呢?請你和艾菲·克林克滾開
What should I say? Why don't you and Effie Klinker just fuck off

782
01:31:46,445 --> 01:31:48,488
-別管我?  -嘴巴幹淨點兒!
- and leave me alone? - You ass-wipe!

783
01:31:48,948 --> 01:31:51,783
你在拿路易斯安那州的法律開玩笑  
You play jump rope with Louisiana law and I'm going to stick

784
01:31:52,242 --> 01:31:54,952
我會死盯著你這個從紐約來的蠢驢的
your big city smarts right up your New York ass.

785
01:31:55,662 --> 01:31:59,832
克洛斯馬克會一些妖術  亂七八糟的東西
This Krusemark was into black magic and all that shit.

786
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:03,380
警察碰到的最糟的事:就是有人為了
Nothing is worse for a cop than people

787
01:32:03,381 --> 01:32:05,504
無稽  瘋狂的理由殺人
who get killed for nutso reasons.

788
01:32:07,006 --> 01:32:08,380
抱歉搞得一團糟
Sorry about the mess.

789
01:32:08,381 --> 01:32:11,301
也許你可以讓你的的黑人將它整理幹淨
Maybe your nigger can clean it up.

790
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:52,088
你正在唱什麼?
What are you singing?

791
01:32:53,923 --> 01:32:57,759
強尼·菲佛瑞的歌  我母親過去總愛唱這首歌
It's by Johnny Favorite. My mother used to sing it all the time.

792
01:33:01,347 --> 01:33:02,264
你沒事吧?
You okay?

793
01:35:00,788 --> 01:35:01,997
他媽的!
Shit!

794
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,632
你想要什麼  安卓先生?
What do you want, Mr. Angel?

795
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:07,135
-我想你應該知道  -為什麼?
- I thought you knew. - Why should l?

796
01:36:07,594 --> 01:36:12,348
你的兩個蠢貨帶著一只狗跟了我幾天了
Two of your morons with a matching poodle have been chasing me for days.

797
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:16,185
我正在找強尼·菲佛瑞
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.

798
01:36:17,186 --> 01:36:20,772
據我所知  那個混蛋已經死了
As far as I know, that dance band scumbag is dead.

799
01:36:21,232 --> 01:36:25,068
那個混蛋或許殺了你的女兒
That dance band scumbag probably killed your daughter.

800
01:36:25,527 --> 01:36:29,697
-是誰在雇用你?  -我不能說
- Who is employing you? - I can't say.

801
01:36:30,282 --> 01:36:33,034
-我會付錢的  -他們也會
- I'll pay. - So do they.

802
01:36:34,285 --> 01:36:39,873
12年前  你和你的女兒從醫院堸蔑蔣a走了菲佛瑞
1 2 years ago, you and your daughter snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.

803
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:43,156
你給了一個癮君子醫生25000塊
You gave a junkie doctor 25 grand

804
01:36:43,157 --> 01:36:45,003
讓他偽造強尼還在那堛漕さ
to pretend Johnny was still there.

805
01:36:45,462 --> 01:36:47,630
直到一個星期前  你的圈套還沒被識破
You did a good job until a week ago.

806
01:36:49,507 --> 01:36:52,301
你用的是愛德華·開利這個名字
You used the name Edward Kelley.

807
01:36:55,012 --> 01:36:59,057
我們到那邊去吧那堣騆安靜  你還可以嘗我們做的湯
Let's go over here. It's a little private and you can sample our Gumbo.

808
01:36:59,516 --> 01:37:04,353
我的胃有毛病  受不了這兒的夥食
I've got an acid stomach. Cajun cooking kills me.

809
01:37:09,817 --> 01:37:13,403
真可惜!我們這兒的湯做得很地道
Pity about your stomach! You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.

810
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:36,592
我就是愛德華·開利  是我付給福勒25000塊
I was Edward Kelley. It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.

811
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:40,053
-強尼認識你嗎?  -不認識
- Did Favorite know you? - No.

812
01:37:40,512 --> 01:37:44,473
他像一個夢遊的人  呆呆地看著窗外
He acted like a sleep walker. He looked out of the window at the lights.

813
01:37:46,059 --> 01:37:50,813
-你把他帶到哪堨h了?  -時代廣場1943除夕夜
- Where were you taking him? - Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.

814
01:37:51,313 --> 01:37:54,649
我們在人群中放走了他  而他就永遠地消失了
We dropped him off in the crowd, and he disappeared forever.

815
01:37:55,108 --> 01:37:57,151
就這麼回事
Or so we thought.

816
01:37:57,611 --> 01:37:59,409
你是說你花了25000塊把他弄出來
You're telling me you paid 25 grand for a guy

817
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:00,488
然後就在人群中把他放了?
and lost him in a crowd?

818
01:38:00,947 --> 01:38:02,656
我這麼做是為了我的女兒
I did it for my daughter.

819
01:38:03,116 --> 01:38:05,084
有些人認為他倆在逢場作戲  
Some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny

820
01:38:05,085 --> 01:38:06,660
可我知道  她已不能自拔
were fooling with. She was obsessed.

821
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,788
我知道  我在她的房間中發現一只被做成木乃伊的手
I know, I found a mummified hand in her room.

822
01:38:10,247 --> 01:38:14,042
光榮的手  它可以打開任何的鎖
The hand of glory. It's supposed to open any lock.

823
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:18,379
它是一個殺人犯的右手上絞刑架前  被切了下來
It was the right hand of a murderer, cut off while his neck was in the noose.

824
01:38:18,838 --> 01:38:21,215
瑪格麗特是這麼認為的
That's what Margaret believed.

825
01:38:21,674 --> 01:38:22,217
妖術!
Black magic!

826
01:38:22,218 --> 01:38:24,616
妖術  法術  又有什麼區別呢?
Black, white, what's the difference?

827
01:38:24,617 --> 01:38:25,886
瑪格麗特總是...
Margaret was always...

828
01:38:26,345 --> 01:38:28,763
-邪惡  -邪惡個屁
- Evil. - Evil as a dunghill.

829
01:38:29,223 --> 01:38:33,560
總是有人說三道四  瑪格麗特並不邪惡
Everyone speaks about someone else. Margaret wasn't evil.

830
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:36,178
她只是個奇怪的孩子!
She was a strange kid!

831
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,731
她會認字前  就會用紙牌算命
She was into Tarot cards before she could read.

832
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:42,859
-誰教她的?  -一些女傭或女家庭教師  誰知道
- Who got her started? - Some maid, or governess, who knows.

833
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:46,697
你說的每句話都是在放屁!
Everything you tell me is a crock of shit!

834
01:38:47,156 --> 01:38:48,949
是你教她的!
You got her started!

835
01:38:49,408 --> 01:38:51,699
你是魔鬼崇拜者!
You're a devil worshipper!

836
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,245
黑暗王子保護有力者
The Prince of Darkness protects the powerful.

837
01:38:54,704 --> 01:38:56,705
-狗屁!  -你不信我也沒辦法
- Shit! - I can't help if you don't believe it.

838
01:38:57,165 --> 01:39:01,252
全告訴我  你這個混蛋  否則我現在就幹掉你!
Come straight with me, you slime-bag, or I'll save the state an execution!

839
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:04,754
是我介紹強尼和我女兒認識的  他很強大
I introduced Johnny Favorite to my daughter.

840
01:39:05,214 --> 01:39:09,426
我親眼見他在我家堨l喚撒旦  他的道行比我深得多
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my home. He was deeper in it than me.

841
01:39:09,884 --> 01:39:12,803
他和撒旦簽了契約  他出賣了他的靈魂
He made a pact with Satan. He sold his soul.

842
01:39:13,263 --> 01:39:16,349
-你以為我會信這些嗎?  -我不在乎!
- You expect me to swallow that? - I don't give a damn!

843
01:39:16,807 --> 01:39:20,226
全是胡扯  你這個騙人的東西!
That's a crock of shit, you lying toad!

844
01:39:20,686 --> 01:39:24,481
-他為了演戲出賣了他的靈魂  -為了演戲?
- He sold his soul for stardom. - For stardom?

845
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:27,233
撒旦在暗中幫他
Satan rose from the depths.

846
01:39:27,692 --> 01:39:30,486
但是他想瞞騙黑暗的王子
But he tried to outwit the Prince of Darkness.

847
01:39:30,945 --> 01:39:34,197
當他變得強大的時候  他想偷偷躲開
When he made it big, he tried to duck out of it.

848
01:39:34,657 --> 01:39:36,158
狗屁!
That's a crock of shit!

849
01:39:36,617 --> 01:39:38,997
強尼從古代的手稿媯o現了一種黑暗儀式
Johnny found an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript.

850
01:39:38,998 --> 01:39:40,453
他需要一個犧牲品
He needed a victim.

851
01:39:40,913 --> 01:39:42,271
要和他同年同月同日出生
Someone his own age.

852
01:39:42,272 --> 01:39:44,124
-為什麼?  -好偷取他的靈魂
- Why? - To steal their soul.

853
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:47,168
土斯和強尼選中了一個年輕的士兵
Toots and Johnny picked up a young soldier.

854
01:39:47,627 --> 01:39:48,711
-是誰?  -只是一個除夕夜在紐約  
- Who? - Just a soldier

855
01:39:49,587 --> 01:39:51,088
慶祝新年的的士兵
celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.

856
01:39:52,465 --> 01:39:53,974
他們把他帶回了強尼住的旅館
They took him back to Johnny's hotel,

857
01:39:53,975 --> 01:39:55,717
在那堨L們舉行了黑暗儀式
where they had the ceremony.

858
01:39:56,176 --> 01:39:57,260
什麼儀式?
What ceremony?

859
01:39:57,719 --> 01:39:59,401
那個男孩被脫光了衣服
The boy was bound naked on a rubber mat,

860
01:39:59,402 --> 01:40:02,598
綁在一個寫滿各種咒語的橡膠墊子上
there were complicated incantations.

861
01:40:03,058 --> 01:40:05,101
他的胸前被打上五星的烙印
A pentacle was branded on his chest.

862
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,228
瑪格麗特給了強尼一把處女匕首
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.

863
01:40:07,687 --> 01:40:10,731
他把那個男孩整齊的切開  吃了他的心
He sliced the boy clean open and ate his heart.

864
01:40:12,066 --> 01:40:15,277
當他吞下去的時候  那顆心仍在跳動
It was still beating when he wolfed it down.

865
01:40:16,945 --> 01:40:19,030
強尼想要變成那個士兵
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.

866
01:40:19,489 --> 01:40:21,824
但他還沒有轉變完  就被應召入伍了
Before he had worked it out, he was drafted,

867
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:25,369
後來受傷被遣送回家的時候  已經忘記自己的身份
injured and sent home without even knowing who he was.

868
01:40:25,828 --> 01:40:27,704
那個男孩是誰?
Who was the boy?

869
01:40:28,164 --> 01:40:29,191
只有強尼知道
Only Johnny knew.

870
01:40:29,192 --> 01:40:32,960
他把姓名牌放在一個花瓶堨瘚馱F瑪格麗特
He put the dog tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret.

871
01:40:33,418 --> 01:40:35,628
把他在時代廣場放走也是瑪格麗特的主意
It was Margaret's plan to drop him off in Times Square.

872
01:40:36,087 --> 01:40:38,839
那是他在出事前記得的最後一個地方
The last place he remembered before it happened.

873
01:40:43,302 --> 01:40:47,263
他需要一個犧牲品  要和他同年同月同日出生
He needed a victim. Someone his own age.

874
01:40:49,266 --> 01:40:52,060
偷取他們的靈魂
To steal their soul.

875
01:40:52,894 --> 01:40:56,981
他把那個男孩整齊的切開並吃了他的心
He sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart.

876
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,358
那個男孩是誰?
Who was the boy?

877
01:41:00,568 --> 01:41:03,403
強尼想變成那個士兵
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.

878
01:41:05,239 --> 01:41:07,111
也許他已得到了那個家夥的靈魂
Maybe he gained the guy's soul,

879
01:41:07,112 --> 01:41:09,117
但在我看來  他仍是強尼
but he still looked like Johnny to me.

880
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:33,414
我知道我是誰了!
I know who I am!

881
01:43:54,225 --> 01:43:55,726
唉...
Alas...

882
01:43:58,813 --> 01:44:01,059
耍些小聰明而沒給自己帶來任何好處
How terrible is wisdom if it brings

883
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,025
那真是太可悲了  強尼
no profit to the wise, Johnny.

884
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:05,944
路易士.賽佛...
Louis Cyphre...

885
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:09,572
"撒旦!"
"Lucifer!"

886
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:14,744
連你的名字也是個該死的笑話
Even your name is a dime store joke.

887
01:44:15,328 --> 01:44:17,162
"梅菲斯特(惡魔)"這個名字
"Mephistopheles" is such a mouthful

888
01:44:17,163 --> 01:44:18,997
在曼哈頓是廣為人知的  強尼
in Manhattan, Johnny.

889
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:21,666
你以為嚇住了一個迷信的老吉他手  
Do you think posing as the devil,

890
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:26,170
一個女巫和剛才那個老家夥  
just because it scared a superstitious old guitar player,

891
01:44:26,629 --> 01:44:29,423
就可以以魔鬼的身份出現  
and that witch, and that nutty old man,

892
01:44:30,091 --> 01:44:34,887
來嚇唬我嗎?沒必要  我知道我是誰
do you think it's going to scare me? It ain't, because I know who I am.

893
01:44:35,763 --> 01:44:39,808
你殺了他們  還想陷害到我身上
You killed them, and you're trying to pin it on me.

894
01:44:40,392 --> 01:44:42,435
我知道我是誰
I know who I am.

895
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:45,000
如果我有分開的蹄子和尾巴的話
If I had cloven hooves and a tail,

896
01:44:45,001 --> 01:44:46,731
你會不會覺得更有說服性
would you be more convinced?

897
01:44:48,483 --> 01:44:50,317
你是神經病
You're crazy.

898
01:44:50,776 --> 01:44:53,611
我知道我是誰  你想陷害我
I know who I am. You're trying to frame me.

899
01:44:54,363 --> 01:44:55,655
你想陷害我
You're trying to frame me.

900
01:44:56,114 --> 01:45:00,659
我知道我是誰是你殺了他們  我沒殺過任何人!
I know who I am. You murdered them people! I never killed nobody!

901
01:45:01,328 --> 01:45:03,663
我沒有殺福勒  
I didn't kill Fowler,

902
01:45:06,082 --> 01:45:08,042
我沒有殺土斯  
I didn't kill Toots,

903
01:45:08,501 --> 01:45:11,420
我也沒有殺瑪格麗特或克洛斯馬克  
and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.

904
01:45:11,879 --> 01:45:14,047
我一個人也沒殺
I killed no one.

905
01:45:14,506 --> 01:45:17,467
-恐怕是你做的  強尼  -我的名字不是強尼!
- I'm afraid you did, Johnny. - My name's not Johnny!

906
01:45:17,926 --> 01:45:22,304
所有人都是你殺的  很自然  是在我的引導下
All killed by your own hand. Guided by me, naturally.

907
01:45:22,805 --> 01:45:27,434
從你把那個男孩切開那一刻開始就注定會這樣
You were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half.

908
01:45:28,602 --> 01:45:33,439
這12年來  你都是活在別人的記憶和生活中
You've been living on borrowed time and another man's memories for 1 2 years.

909
01:45:37,819 --> 01:45:42,072
-我想告訴瓦恩薩普  他知道的!  -他死了
- I want to tell Winesap, he knows! - He's dead.

910
01:45:43,282 --> 01:45:44,324
可怕的意外!
Nasty accident!

911
01:45:46,535 --> 01:45:49,886
別擔心  不會有人因少了個律師而傷心
Don't worry, no one will mourn one less lawyer.

912
01:45:49,887 --> 01:45:51,748
反正每天都會有人死
Death's everywhere these days.

913
01:45:54,167 --> 01:45:57,920
是什麼讓人生活的有價值呢?
But what gives human life its worth, anyway?

914
01:45:58,671 --> 01:46:01,590
是因為有愛和恨
Because someone loves it, hates it.

915
01:46:02,049 --> 01:46:06,219
血肉身軀是短暫的  只有靈魂是永遠的
The flesh is weak. Only the soul is immortal.

916
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:14,477
而你的靈魂是屬於我的!
And yours belongs to me!

917
01:46:19,398 --> 01:46:21,191
我知道我是誰
I know who I am.

918
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:28,531
好了  強尼  仔細看一下吧!
That's it Johnny, take a good look!

919
01:46:29,574 --> 01:46:32,785
不管你多麼聰明地掩飾你的所作所為  
However cleverly you sneak up on the mirror, your reflection

920
01:46:33,244 --> 01:46:35,871
但從你的眼神中  事實總是會反映出來
always looks you straight in the eye.

921
01:46:35,872 --> 01:46:37,039
我知道我是誰
I know who I am.

922
01:47:07,817 --> 01:47:09,818
我知道我是誰!
I know who I am!

923
01:48:22,176 --> 01:48:23,802
你回來幹什麼?
Why did you come back?

924
01:48:34,145 --> 01:48:36,021
我住在這兒
I live here.

925
01:48:37,690 --> 01:48:39,233
她是誰?
Who is she?

926
01:48:41,652 --> 01:48:44,988
她肯定不是:安卓  哈勒德
She ain't: Angel, Harold.

927
01:48:47,574 --> 01:48:49,450
她是我的女兒
She's my daughter.

928
01:48:50,076 --> 01:48:52,786
胡說!她是誰?
Bullshit! Who is she?

929
01:48:53,955 --> 01:48:56,957
艾普芙尼·普勞德富特
Epiphany Proudfoot.

930
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:00,252
她只在這兒呆了一會兒
She stayed here for a little while.

931
01:49:02,796 --> 01:49:04,743
但你有足夠的時間殺了她?
Long enough for you to kill her?

932
01:49:04,744 --> 01:49:07,341
難道不是你的家夥把她搞死的嗎?
Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?

933
01:49:25,066 --> 01:49:26,859
你會為此受到懲罰的
You're going to burn for this.

934
01:49:29,779 --> 01:49:31,155
我知道
I know.

935
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,826
在地獄!
In hell!
