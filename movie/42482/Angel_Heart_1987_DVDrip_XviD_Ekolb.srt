1
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,257
How are you?

2
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,349
Hello!

3
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,644
Yes, this is Harold Angel.

4
00:02:58,103 --> 00:03:00,146
Yes, initial R, like in the phone book.

5
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,815
Excuse me?

6
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,983
Winesap.

7
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:08,821
Herman Winesap,
Winesap & Mackintosh?

8
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,948
Hold on a second!

9
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,621
Winesap from Winesap & . . .

10
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,999
Mackintosh. I've got it!

11
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,296
Of course I know what an attorney is.

12
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,008
It's like a lawyer,
only the bills are bigger.

13
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:33,845
Sure, I'll hold.

14
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:35,304
Asshole!

15
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:44,104
Hello, Mr. Winesap? Harold Angel.

16
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,109
Yeah, I could be free.

17
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,195
Would this be with your firm?

18
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,076
Gimme that again.

19
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:03,206
Louis . . . how do you spell that?

20
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,836
Cyphre . . . okay.
What is it . . . foreign?

21
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,798
Is your client a foreigner?

22
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,429
Mr. Winesap, could you
give me a few more details?

23
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:23,767
Okay, I know the place.

24
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,895
It's a long way up, but I can be there.

25
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,397
Hallelujah!
Show right now how much you love God!

26
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,233
I want you to show! It's your time!

27
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,361
Open up your hearts
and open up your wallets!

28
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,113
Open your purses!

29
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,656
Open your pockets!

30
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,952
And give it up! Praise the Lord!
Somebody has been talking about me

31
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:33,332
riding around in a Cadillac.
If you love me and want to give to me,

32
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,168
then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!

33
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,810
Would you come with me, please?

34
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,032
An unfortunate husband

35
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:13,620
of one of Pastor John's flock
took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.

36
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,873
Mr. Angel? Please?

37
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:45,650
Allow me to introduce my client,
Monsieur Louis Cyphre.

38
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:51,322
Hi, Harry Angel.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.

39
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:57,411
I don't want to appear impolite,

40
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,664
but do you have any l. D.?
- Sure! Here . . .

41
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:07,379
How's that?

42
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,631
GU N PERM IT

43
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,308
Nothing personal.
I'm a little over-cautious.

44
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:25,604
You know how these things are.
- I know. So . . .

45
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:29,024
How did you hear about me?

46
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:39,117
I guess
you guys just looked in the phone book.

47
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:48,167
Usually that's what happens. Because
my name is "Angel", it's under "A" . . .

48
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,128
People are lazy.
They see the first name

49
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,422
and . . .
- Johnny Favorite.

50
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:54,757
Excuse me?

51
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:58,260
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

52
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,471
Johnny . . .
No, I don't think so.

53
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,599
You never knew him?
- Am I supposed to?

54
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:08,061
He was a crooner before the war,
quite famous in his way.

55
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:12,899
Well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre . . .

56
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,570
I'm sorry!

57
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,991
I usually don't get involved

58
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:29,247
in anything very heavy. I usually
handle insurance jobs, divorces,

59
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:31,750
things of that nature.

60
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:37,630
If I'm lucky sometimes
I handle people. But I don't know

61
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,258
no crooners

62
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:43,719
or anybody famous.
- His real name was Liebling.

63
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:48,349
I don't know any Liebling, either.

64
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:51,852
What do you want from me?

65
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,022
Does this man owe you money?
- Not quite.

66
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,649
I helped Johnny
at the beginning of his career.

67
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:01,569
You were like . . . his agent?

68
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,280
No!

69
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,616
Nothing so . . .

70
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:09,785
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.

71
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:13,664
Certain collateral was to be forfeited
in the event of his death.

72
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:18,335
You're talking about a guy that's dead?
- He was drafted in '43,

73
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:22,130
North Africa.
"Special Entertainment Services".

74
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,634
There was an attack,
and his head and face was badly injured.

75
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:29,971
He had . . .
- Amnesia. I think you call it . . .

76
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:33,975
Shell shock.
- Exactly! - I know how that feels.

77
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:38,729
Why? Were you in the services?
- I was in for a short time.

78
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:42,066
But I got a little fucked up.

79
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:48,155
Excuse me! They shipped me home,
and I missed the whole shebang:

80
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:53,827
the war, the medals, everything.
I guess you could say I was lucky.

81
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:57,414
Johnny wasn't so lucky.
He returned home a zombie.

82
00:09:57,872 --> 00:10:02,043
His friends had him transferred
to a private hospital upstate.

83
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,130
There was some sort of
radical psychiatric treatment involved.

84
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,425
His lawyers had
the power of attorney

85
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,511
to pay the bills, things like that.
But you know how it is.

86
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,140
He remained a vegetable, and my
contract was never honored. - I see.

87
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,435
I don't want to sound mercenary.

88
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:26,316
My only interest in Johnny
is in finding out if he's alive or dead.

89
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:30,528
Each year my office receives a
signed affidavit confirming

90
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:34,073
that Johnny Liebling
is indeed among the living.

91
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:38,202
But last weekend
Monsieur Cyphre and l, just by chance,

92
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,830
were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.

93
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:46,710
We decided to check for ourselves,
but we got misleading information.

94
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:48,295
The run-around!

95
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:52,841
I didn't want to cause a scene,
I hate any sort of fuss.

96
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,301
I thought, perhaps you could

97
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,471
subtly and in a quiet manner . . .

98
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,515
You want me to check it out.
- Check it out!

99
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,692
I have a feeling I've met you before.

100
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,236
I don't know, I don't think so.

101
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,627
Do you remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

102
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,842
His real name was Liebling.

103
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:48,435
My only interest in Johnny
is in finding out if he's alive or dead.

104
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,645
May I help you?
- My name is Harry Conroy

105
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:38,315
from the National lnstitute of Health.

106
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:42,360
Is there
anyone in particular you want to see?

107
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:46,990
The lnstitute is conducting a survey
of incurable trauma cases.

108
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:51,661
I understand you have a patient here
fitting that description?

109
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,997
We can't let you see anyone
without an appointment.

110
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:58,834
I appreciate that,
but maybe you could check the files

111
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:01,086
and make sure I'm on the right track.

112
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,922
I don't want to bother anybody
unnecessarily.

113
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,883
Okay? Thank you.

114
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:11,179
What's the name of the patient?
- Liebling, Jonathan Liebling.

115
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,474
One moment please, I'll check.

116
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,730
Were you working here last weekend?

117
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:25,192
No, day off.
- Did you do anything nice?

118
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,070
My sister's wedding.

119
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:33,867
We did have a Mr. Liebling,
but he was transferred.

120
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:36,369
You sure?
- That's what it says.

121
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:41,291
And when was that?
- Years ago, in December '43.

122
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,210
May I take a look at this? Thanks.

123
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:48,464
Is this recent?

124
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,008
It's an old file.
- It's in ballpoint!

125
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:54,386
They weren't big on ballpoint in '43.

126
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,764
Is that ballpoint?

127
00:13:57,222 --> 00:14:00,142
Well, I'll be!
They didn't have ballpoints back then?

128
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:02,477
No.

129
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,145
This here

130
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:06,231
Dr. Fowler,

131
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,860
does he still work here?
- Just part-time, he's old.

132
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:13,821
Thank you.

133
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,681
Time for your evening fix?

134
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,103
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

135
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,398
Through the mailslot.
I'm a private detective.

136
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,151
Breaking and entering is a crime,

137
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,655
whoever or whatever you are.
- Hey man, call the police!

138
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,700
Which you won't do in case
they discover your opium den

139
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:17,202
in the icebox!

140
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:29,255
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled
to keep pharmaceuticals at home.

141
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:34,135
Tell it to somebody else!
We're not talking about a Band-Aid

142
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:38,263
or a tube of unguent. How long you
been hooked? - What do you want?

143
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,558
Information about Johnny Liebling.

144
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:45,020
I treated a patient
of that name many years ago.

145
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,480
I'm not fooling around.

146
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:54,529
Either you give me some answers
or I'll call the police myself.

147
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:58,783
I've seen the works cooking upstairs,
and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.

148
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:02,328
He was an entertainer
during the war, a neuro case.

149
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:06,498
No chance of recovery, so I transferred
him to a V.A. hospital in Albany.

150
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,502
I hate to shake you up,
but I checked, and he's not there.

151
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:13,588
You faked the transfer.

152
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:17,842
Because he recently had a visitor,
the first in 1 2 years.

153
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:20,595
Popular guy, eh?

154
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:26,684
Where is he now?
- I don't know . . . - Come here!

155
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:32,314
I haven't seen him
since he was a patient here.

156
00:18:32,982 --> 00:18:35,150
You're in a cold sweat! Look at you!

157
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:39,821
You can't wait for me to leave
so you can raid the icebox.

158
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:45,035
The sooner you get out with it,
the sooner you can shoot up.

159
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:51,749
I'll ask you again: Where is he?

160
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,751
I don't know.

161
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,256
Some people came one night years ago.
He got in the car with them and left.

162
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:02,259
He got into a car?
I thought this guy was a vegetable.

163
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,929
At first he was in a coma
but he quickly recovered.

164
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:08,432
But he still suffered from amnesia.

165
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,141
The friends.

166
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,064
Who were the friends?
- His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.

167
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,567
The young lady I don't know.
She stayed in the car.

168
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:24,238
Where did they take him? - Down South.
The man said: "We're taking him home."

169
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,740
And what was the deal?
- $25,000.

170
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,203
For what? - I was supposed to pretend
that he was still a patient in hospital.

171
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:35,374
Didn't the administration suspect?
- Why should they? I kept the charts

172
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:41,046
up to date. And no one asks questions
when the bills get paid.

173
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,673
Tell me about Johnny Liebling.

174
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:48,594
What did he look like?
- No idea. His face was damaged.

175
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:53,349
He had facial reconstruction.
He was in bandages the day he left.

176
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,226
What can you tell me about Kelley?

177
00:19:56,685 --> 00:20:00,772
It's too long ago.
I only have a vague memory.

178
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:05,068
He was well dressed
and had a southern accent.

179
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:10,657
I truly don't remember.
- All right, Doc. Have a lie down.

180
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:13,368
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.

181
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:18,122
Maybe a few hours cold turkey
will refresh your memory.

182
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,673
Watch yourself!

183
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:32,385
We're going to take
a little nap, sit your ass down.

184
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,721
We're going to clear your mind.

185
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,391
I'm going out. When I get back,

186
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,644
I'll fix you some goodies
from the icebox, alright?

187
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:46,148
Tell me what I want to know
and you'll get rid of me forever.

188
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:24,047
I'm back, Doc!
I brought you a little something!

189
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,013
I didn't think
you'd want a cheeseburger . . .

190
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,388
I will! Bye!

191
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,182
Hi, Ellie!

192
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,518
Is that your boyfriend?

193
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:09,896
He's got a car and everything?

194
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:13,984
See you later!

195
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:53,312
Did you see him?
- No.

196
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:57,024
Why not?
- It would've been difficult. - Why?

197
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,735
Why? Because he's not there.

198
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:05,282
Johnny Favorite
walked out of the clinic 1 2 years ago,

199
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:10,912
in his best suit, with a new face
wrapped in bandages and a headache.

200
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,248
He left with a guy called Kelley

201
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:17,251
and a girl.
Do you know this Kelley?

202
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:23,424
It seems this Kelley paid off
some bent doctor called Fowler

203
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:28,262
to pinch hit for your guy.
He's covered up for him all these years.

204
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,104
Looks like our Johnny has

205
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:42,317
a perfect disappearing act.
- It seems so.

206
00:26:44,861 --> 00:26:46,988
But you know what they say about slugs.

207
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:50,324
No, what do they say about slugs?

208
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:53,244
They always leave slime in their tracks.

209
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:03,628
You'll find him.
- No, I won't find him.

210
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:08,383
Because I left out one little detail.

211
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,761
This Dr. Fowler ended up dead

212
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,056
with his fucking brains blown out.

213
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:20,185
Did you kill him?
- No!

214
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:22,688
But the cops might think I did.

215
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:27,984
I took on a $1 25-a-day
missing persons job for you.

216
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:32,197
Now, I'm a murder suspect.
That's it! I'm out.

217
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:39,328
Such are the hazards of your profession.
If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.

218
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,247
You bother me!

219
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:44,375
The closest I ever come to death

220
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:50,172
is watching a hearse go by
on 2nd Avenue. That's the way I like it.

221
00:27:52,257 --> 00:27:53,258
Are you afraid?

222
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,595
Yeah, I'm afraid.

223
00:27:58,013 --> 00:28:01,266
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately
to send you a check for $5,000.

224
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:05,770
If you don't want the job,
I'll engage someone else.

225
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,400
5,000?

226
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,699
You want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?

227
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,077
I don't like messy accounts.

228
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,587
Some religions think the egg is the
symbol of the soul, did you know that?

229
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,589
No.

230
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,263
Would you like an egg?

231
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,561
No, thank you.
I got a thing about chickens.

232
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:48,786
It's after eleven, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

233
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:53,374
You get it?
- If I lose my job,

234
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:56,335
I'll come and be your secretary.

235
00:32:56,794 --> 00:33:01,590
I couldn't pay you what the "Times"
pays. Besides, they won't miss it.

236
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:05,260
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?

237
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:10,223
He really was a crooner, like you said.
I didn't realize he was so big.

238
00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:14,811
He was in a band called the Spider
Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.

239
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:19,398
Only Spider is here in town.
- Where? - I wrote it all down.

240
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,442
The dyke in the archive is suspicious.

241
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:24,820
My boss hasn't
researched the story in years.

242
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,905
You can get the files.

243
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:30,283
Spider is in an old people's home
on 1 38th Street.

244
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,703
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.

245
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:37,332
There was a picture of Johnny
with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.

246
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,542
No one's heard of him for years!

247
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,044
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,

248
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:46,382
Margaret Krusemark.
Her dad owns half of Louisiana.

249
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:51,804
Met him at a high school prom. Johnny
shit on her, and she went back to Daddy.

250
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:54,181
There's lots on their spells.

251
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,309
Spells, what do you mean, spells?

252
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:00,437
The eye of a newt,

253
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:04,315
toe of a frog and that kind of shit?
- Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.

254
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:07,694
Casting spells
at society do's and stuff.

255
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:13,157
Didn't go down too well with
the lvy League stiffos.

256
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:17,703
She was known as the Witch of Wellesly.

257
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:20,748
Did I do good?

258
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:27,170
Great! So what've I got:
A religious loonie as a client.

259
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:30,715
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils"
and we don't know where he is.

260
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:34,385
And he probably doesn't know who he is.

261
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:38,848
I got a geriatric bandleader
in a home in Harlem.

262
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:42,226
I got a guitar player
called Toots Sweet.

263
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:44,228
What else have I got?

264
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:45,980
A hard-on?

265
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:52,527
Are you okay?

266
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:31,356
January 3rd,

267
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:37,111
1 955. Client: Louis Cyphre.
Copy: Winesap & Mackintosh,

268
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,615
attorneys. As reported,
Johnny Favorite has not been

269
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:46,453
in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in
Poughkeepsie for the last 1 2 years.

270
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:51,416
He was taken away by a man
called Edward Kelley and a girl.

271
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,752
The girl is unidentified.

272
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,922
Kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25,000
to falsify reports

273
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:01,342
stating
that Favorite was still in the hospital.

274
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:10,059
The doctor is now deceased.

275
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:15,314
Before Johnny's accident it seemed
like his career was going great,

276
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:20,735
until he started to dump on everyone.
I tracked down Spider Simpson,

277
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:24,239
Johnny's old bandleader. He resides

278
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:27,450
at the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice

279
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:32,538
on 1 38th Street. Johnny also
had a good buddy, a guitar player

280
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:36,292
called Toots Sweet.
Toots went back to Algiers.

281
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,462
That's Algiers in New Orleans.

282
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:44,966
I think maybe Margaret went back there,
and maybe Johnny, too.

283
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:50,680
Oh, yeah! According to Spider,
Johnny had a secret love.

284
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,933
A black lady
called Evangeline Proudfoot.

285
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:59,897
Evangeline ran
some kind of spooky store in Harlem

286
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,399
called "Mammy Carter's."

287
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:12,617
You don't
need to know that, Cyphre. I think

288
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:16,454
a secret love should stay secret.

289
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:19,165
The only person

290
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:21,793
who Johnny was seeing regularly

291
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:26,130
was a palm reader
in Coney lsland called Madame Zora.

292
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,027
Are you lzzy?

293
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:53,948
Looks like the last bit of sun, eh?

294
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:59,495
The guy in the arcade over there
told me you might be able to help me.

295
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:04,958
I'm looking for Madame Zora. - I know
her, friend of the wife before the war.

296
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:08,795
She was a fortune teller, right?
- And then some!

297
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:13,842
I hate those hocus-pocus bitches!
Her and the wife got along real well.

298
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,427
Wife's a baptist. Oh, here!

299
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:18,971
Have a nose shield!

300
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,477
Go on, take one. I found a whole
boxful under the boardwalk.

301
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,645
There's not much sun right now.

302
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,814
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.

303
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:32,401
Ever hear of a Johnny Favorite?

304
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:36,238
The singer?
- Yeah, he used to visit Madame Zora.

305
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:40,367
Heard of him, but don't know nothing.
Ask the wife.

306
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:44,579
She always sings stupid tunes
off the radio. She knows all that shit.

307
00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:47,457
She likes the water, eh?
- She hates it.

308
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:51,335
She's getting on the heavy side.
She thinks it's good for varicose veins.

309
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,923
Alright, thanks.

310
00:38:57,174 --> 00:38:59,259
What do you do here in the summer?

311
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:01,220
Bite the heads off the rats.

312
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:05,348
And in the winter?
- The same.

313
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:19,904
Excuse me!

314
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:24,158
I was just talking to your husband.

315
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:27,453
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.

316
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:30,914
Yeah, I knew her before the war,
Madame Zora, you say?

317
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:33,917
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!

318
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:40,089
Had the booth across the boardwalk from
me. She was a debutante not a gypsy,

319
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,967
and she did
more than just read tea leaves.

320
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:49,849
Did you ever see her with a guy called
Johnny Favorite? - Yeah, he was cute.

321
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:55,687
She was stuck on him. He was called
"Golden Tonsils". I knew all his tunes.

322
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,649
Have you ever
heard of a Margaret Krusemark?

323
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:04,404
Don't be a gazoony, fellah!
Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.

324
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:07,740
Well what happened to her?

325
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:13,120
Packed up her stuff
and went back home, down south.

326
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,123
You have any idea
where I could find Johnny Favorite?

327
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:20,669
No, maybe the cemetery.
Want to hear one of his tunes?

328
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,891
Thanks for the nose shield.
I'm going to need it where I'm going.

329
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,728
In Brooklyn?
- Louisiana. - Nice.

330
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,523
Where'd he go?

331
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:35,337
FOR COLORED PATRONS ON LY

332
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:43,151
Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting,
but you're a little early.

333
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,323
I had a bad line.
I didn't know if you said 4:00 or 4:30.

334
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:57,415
This is a wild place you got here!
- Yes, I've been very happy here.

335
00:43:57,873 --> 00:44:01,335
I've never had my fortune read before.
Does it take long?

336
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:06,590
I'll take the details now. It usually
takes a couple of days to do a chart.

337
00:44:10,635 --> 00:44:11,678
Tea?

338
00:44:14,222 --> 00:44:15,223
Do you want some tea?

339
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:17,267
Yes, thank you.

340
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,816
Darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?

341
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:30,696
Not many people like oolong.

342
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:42,707
Do you play the piano?

343
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,376
No, not exactly.

344
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Sing?

345
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:52,091
I can carry a tune,
but no . . . not really.

346
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,181
Who is this mean looking guy?

347
00:45:00,974 --> 00:45:01,975
My father.

348
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,061
I'm sorry!

349
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:06,229
Don't worry, he hates it too.

350
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:12,152
He looks like one of those guys
in an old pirate movie. What's his name?

351
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,905
Ethan.
- Ethan Krusemark . . .

352
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,575
Well, I tell you,
I never saw any of Ethan's movies.

353
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:32,754
Do you speak French?

354
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:35,465
I'm from Brooklyn.

355
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:40,303
I would prefer it if you didn't smoke.
- That's okay.

356
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:42,096
Cream or sugar?

357
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:44,807
Straight up is fine, thank you.

358
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:48,519
I need your exact date of birth.

359
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:50,521
Sure!

360
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,983
I was born on February 14th . . .

361
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:02,449
. . . 1 91 8, on Valentine's day.

362
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:09,038
How curious! I used to know a boy
who was born on that exact same day.

363
00:46:09,497 --> 00:46:14,877
Well, you know how it is,
all the soldiers home on leave and all.

364
00:46:15,336 --> 00:46:19,507
Maybe we could pull your friend's chart
and save ourselves some time.

365
00:46:19,965 --> 00:46:24,595
I don't think so. Every person
is very different. I don't think

366
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:27,014
you'd like his chart.

367
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,433
Place of birth?

368
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:34,979
Brooklyn, New York.
Was your friend a jerk or something?

369
00:46:36,272 --> 00:46:37,649
You could say that.

370
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:42,486
I guess you didn't get along.

371
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:44,822
You and Johnny.

372
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:52,996
You and Johnny Favorite?

373
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:03,631
Who are you?
- I was an old army buddy.

374
00:47:04,674 --> 00:47:08,136
I thought you two were kinda . . .

375
00:47:09,178 --> 00:47:13,682
Look, I ain't no army buddy, I'm just
a guy who was paid to snoop around.

376
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:17,227
To tell the truth,
I wasn't born on Valentine's day.

377
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:21,023
It's Johnny's future I'm interested in.

378
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:24,234
Johnny has no future, he's dead.

379
00:47:24,985 --> 00:47:27,404
He died 1 2 years ago.
I'd like you to leave.

380
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:33,159
I know you're thinking who is this creep
poking his snitch in everything.

381
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:37,872
I don't want to sound nosy, but . . .
- He's dead, Mr. Angel.

382
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:40,708
And if he isn't, he is to me.

383
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:44,628
He must've hurt you pretty bad!

384
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:47,297
We all have our scars.

385
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:52,552
I don't know too much about the guy, but
he must've been stupid to let you go.

386
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:57,098
Lies and cruelty
come very easily to some people.

387
00:47:57,557 --> 00:48:01,311
Pity, I really would've liked
to have gotten my palm read.

388
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:04,856
Then I could have held
your hand just a little longer.

389
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:10,069
I don't think you'd like what I see.

390
00:48:13,113 --> 00:48:14,656
Very pretty necklace!

391
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,775
You got any High John

392
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:54,694
the Conquerer root?
- Powdered or hanging?

393
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:56,946
I'm not really sure.

394
00:48:57,405 --> 00:48:58,656
Caught in the rain, eh?

395
00:49:02,994 --> 00:49:04,995
Two roots, $1 .20.

396
00:49:07,456 --> 00:49:13,253
I have a question.
I had an acquaintance in Harlem

397
00:49:13,712 --> 00:49:15,547
who used to deal in the root.

398
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:18,049
Name was Evangeline. Heard of her?

399
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:21,678
Practically everyone around here is
called Evangeline. After the poem.

400
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,763
Do you know it?

401
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:27,141
Yeah, I know it.

402
00:49:27,892 --> 00:49:31,312
This acquaintance had a store in Harlem
and it was the same name:

403
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:34,273
"Carter."
- Everybody uses the name, mister.

404
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:37,443
Like "Howard Johnson,"
but this is the real place.

405
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:39,778
Her name was Proudfoot.

406
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:42,656
Evangeline Proudfoot?

407
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:49,537
I knew her. She used to come back all
the time when she lived in New York.

408
00:49:49,996 --> 00:49:53,583
Do you know where she is now?
- She got sick and died.

409
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,503
She went back to the Holy Shelter
swamp and was buried in Armandville.

410
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:02,883
She was waiting on some fellah.
- Just like in the poem? - Yep.

411
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:04,718
$1 .20.

412
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:11,266
Who was the guy?
- She never told.

413
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:16,229
Okay, thanks.

414
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,655
A week, you say?
- At the most.

415
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,712
What is it?

416
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,631
Why are you crying?

417
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,176
We're going to Grandma. What's there?

418
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,053
Grandma.

419
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:36,888
Grandma.

420
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:52,153
Let's go.

421
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:55,406
Give me your hand.

422
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:53,043
I'm sorry!
I got these off a guy in Coney lsland.

423
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:55,587
Some crazy guy.

424
00:52:58,048 --> 00:52:59,257
I'm sorry.

425
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:01,051
Stop crying.

426
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:07,473
I was hoping
I could talk with your mother.

427
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,435
You're a little late.
Did you know her?

428
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:16,607
No, I never met her but I was hoping
she could answer some questions for me.

429
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:18,567
Are you a cop?

430
00:53:19,026 --> 00:53:21,028
No, my name is Harry Angel.

431
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:24,906
I'm a private detective.

432
00:53:25,365 --> 00:53:28,577
So what's . . .?
- Epiphany.

433
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:34,165
Your mama left you
with a very beautiful name.

434
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:35,959
And not much else.

435
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:40,755
Actually, I'm looking for
a friend of your mother's,

436
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,425
a guy called Johnny Favorite.

437
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:47,594
I met all her friends
but never anyone called Favorite.

438
00:53:49,721 --> 00:53:51,265
Shit!

439
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:54,267
I got a thing about chickens.

440
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,526
This Favorite was friends with your
mother in New York city before the war.

441
00:54:03,985 --> 00:54:08,572
Well, she never told me.
Mama had a lot of guys. She liked men.

442
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,991
How about a guy called Toots Sweet?

443
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:16,371
He was a friend of Favorite. Know him?
- No. - He was a good guitar player.

444
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,999
I was going to catch his act tonight.

445
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:25,588
I'm going to be
staying in town, in a hotel.

446
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,550
If you remember anything

447
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:32,845
that might help me,
give me a call.

448
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:44,815
You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany,
your name suits you.

449
00:54:49,277 --> 00:54:50,695
These crazy chickens!

450
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:00,038
What are you after him for,
Johnny Favorite?

451
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:04,709
I'm not after him. I'm just being paid
to find out where he is.

452
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:09,255
He could be 6 feet under.
- Then I'll have to buy a shovel.

453
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:10,729
How are you, sugar?

454
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,425
Some beautiful tune

455
00:56:42,884 --> 00:56:46,596
you were singing there, Mr. Sweet.
- Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?

456
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:52,060
Mine's on the house. Special cocktail.
Whatever's in it gives a big kick.

457
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,439
You know, I heard you play
years ago in New York.

458
00:56:56,897 --> 00:57:00,651
Before the war
at the old Dickie Wells Bar.

459
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:06,531
You were having it up pretty good
with a guy called Johnny Favorite.

460
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:11,494
Yeah, I vaguely remember.
- You and he were buddies, weren't you?

461
00:57:11,953 --> 00:57:15,707
No, he recorded one of my songs.
Say, are you a dick or a book writer?

462
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:21,337
Neither. I'm a journalist
and I'm doing this piece

463
00:57:21,796 --> 00:57:25,132
about Johnny
and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.

464
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:28,427
Spider played them drums
like two jackrabbits fucking!

465
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:32,681
Haven't got much time. Got to piss,
spit and get back to work.

466
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,185
Try one of those cocktails. Then you can
make the whole thing up as you like.

467
00:57:37,644 --> 00:57:40,313
That's what you usually do, anyway.

468
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:03,794
I can't even take a piss!

469
00:58:04,252 --> 00:58:07,839
I just wanted to talk about Johnny
Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.

470
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:12,302
I'm too big to go hiding under beds.
I don't know nothing.

471
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,512
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!

472
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:33,655
What's going on? - Nothing! Mind your
own business. I want to piss!

473
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:36,658
Get outta here,

474
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:40,286
or you'll wish your little white ass
was never born.

475
00:58:40,745 --> 00:58:42,914
Please! I've got a thing about chickens.

476
01:02:45,016 --> 01:02:47,435
End of bullshit time!

477
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,188
I've had a
good look at you and young Epiphany

478
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,608
doing your hot shoe number
with the chicken.

479
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:55,484
Listen!

480
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:58,779
I ain't up on this voodoo shit.
I'm from Brooklyn.

481
01:02:59,238 --> 01:03:03,617
We ain't all Baptists here.
- What's with this Proudfoot girl?

482
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:08,080
She's a mambo priestess, like her mom.
Has been since she was 1 3.

483
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:11,291
When was the last time you saw
Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?

484
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,837
He used to run around with Ma mambo.
- I ain't seen him since before the war.

485
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:20,925
And the chicken foot in the john?
- It means I got a big mouth.

486
01:03:21,384 --> 01:03:24,762
It's not big enough.
What's this fucking star

487
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:27,598
in your mouth? I'll tell you what.

488
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:34,104
I'll give you my hotel number.
Gimme a call if you hear anything.

489
01:03:36,106 --> 01:03:38,150
You never know.

490
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:42,028
Next time you get a delivery of a
chicken foot, you might need help.

491
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:47,575
As far as I'm concerned,
any dead chicken is a good chicken.

492
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,929
Only cops and bad news don't knock.

493
01:05:38,388 --> 01:05:40,306
Only private dicks sleep late.

494
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:46,103
Quite a dream you were having!
- I was on my way to Mandalay.

495
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:51,692
Shit! There's some leak up there!

496
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:55,404
Here! ls this your name?

497
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,708
That your hotel?

498
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,211
You're standing in it, ain't you?
- Your handwriting?

499
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:14,839
I think so.

500
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,884
Then perhaps you can tell us
why we found it in the hand

501
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:21,303
of a dead guitar player.

502
01:06:25,432 --> 01:06:26,766
Toots Sweet is dead?

503
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:32,522
This one wasn't so quick,
this one took time.

504
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:34,399
How did he die?

505
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:39,111
Technically?
Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.

506
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:41,864
And not so technically?

507
01:06:42,323 --> 01:06:45,159
They cut his dick off
and choked him with it.

508
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:48,662
Then redecorated his apartment
with his blood.

509
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:54,751
When did you see him? - I interviewed
him around 1 :00. - About what?

510
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,711
A missing person.

511
01:06:57,962 --> 01:06:59,130
Who?

512
01:07:00,381 --> 01:07:02,258
A guy who took a walk 1 2 years ago.

513
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:06,179
There was a photo of him and Toots.
- Who is the party you're looking for?

514
01:07:06,637 --> 01:07:10,182
I can't say.
I'm working for a New York lawyer.

515
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:13,352
Name?
- Come on, man!

516
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:16,855
Winesap!
You want his number, his address?

517
01:07:17,314 --> 01:07:19,983
Ask Tess Truehart over there,
it's in the book.

518
01:07:20,442 --> 01:07:25,113
Under "W," genius! - Do you know
Ted Williams, the baseball player?

519
01:07:32,078 --> 01:07:34,580
Alright, is that it, guys?

520
01:07:36,832 --> 01:07:38,042
That's it.

521
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,672
You can go eat lunch,
but don't stroll too far.

522
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:46,341
Not until we talk to this lawyer.

523
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,393
Ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club?"

524
01:07:59,437 --> 01:08:02,064
Do you know what today is?

525
01:08:02,523 --> 01:08:04,775
Today is Wednesday.

526
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:07,736
It's "anything can happen" day.

527
01:09:37,446 --> 01:09:38,739
Hey man, do you want a tune?

528
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:43,827
Yeah, I got a tune for you.

529
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:12,621
Hiya, boys!

530
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:17,376
Same to you.
I'm getting kinda hungry.

531
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:19,878
Do you want to sell some of those?

532
01:14:26,926 --> 01:14:29,929
1 0 cents a sack.
- Sure, give me a sack.

533
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:59,373
Listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old
man wants you on the first train home.

534
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:01,667
Take that fucking thing away from me!

535
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:05,796
Don't, or the dog will bite
your fucking face clean off.

536
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:33,781
What happened to you?

537
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,158
A dog bit me.

538
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,619
So, what do you want?

539
01:15:40,078 --> 01:15:42,456
Right now, I need a laundry.

540
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,877
Listen, Epiphiny . . .
- Epiphany.

541
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:50,588
There's something I want to ask you.

542
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:56,469
The other night I saw you and Toots
boogying with the cock-a-doodle.

543
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,929
Looked like you were having some party.

544
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,349
What's your problem?
It's a free country.

545
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:06,228
Not for chickens.
- Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.

546
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,106
Listen, Toots is . . .

547
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:11,942
Toots is dead.
- I know, I heard.

548
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:15,069
You set him up.
- No, I didn't.

549
01:16:15,528 --> 01:16:18,656
You were the only one
that knew I was seeing Toots.

550
01:16:19,991 --> 01:16:22,410
You sent the
gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?

551
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:25,037
Toots had a big mouth.

552
01:16:25,496 --> 01:16:28,791
I guess he did,
judging by what the cops found in it.

553
01:16:29,249 --> 01:16:33,295
Quite a cute religion! - Nailing a man
to a cross ain't so cute either!

554
01:16:33,754 --> 01:16:35,672
You've got to kill the chicken
to make the soup, eh?

555
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:41,136
We don't go around murdering people.
What about your Johnny Favorite?

556
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:46,349
Now you remember him after all.
- Yes, he was my father.

557
01:16:53,272 --> 01:16:56,066
I'll pick the baby up later, okay?
- He'll be all right.

558
01:16:56,525 --> 01:17:01,154
Anything you're holding out,
now is a good time to tell.

559
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:02,614
Nothing to tell.

560
01:17:03,907 --> 01:17:06,576
Johnny never came back from the war.

561
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:11,289
Mama waited and Mama died.
Sad and simple.

562
01:17:12,457 --> 01:17:16,919
There's too many dead bodies
floating around, even for Louisiana.

563
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:20,631
I'd tell your old man
to look out for you.

564
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:23,801
You do have a husband?
- No.

565
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,386
No?

566
01:17:26,095 --> 01:17:28,388
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!

567
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:31,058
Really.

568
01:17:32,017 --> 01:17:36,104
The kind of eyes
that tell what's going on inside.

569
01:17:36,563 --> 01:17:39,065
Right now, you're scared.
- I'll manage.

570
01:17:42,402 --> 01:17:45,446
Listen . . .
- Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.

571
01:17:49,033 --> 01:17:51,076
Call me if you don't.

572
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:53,412
Alright?

573
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,686
I have a message for you.

574
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,276
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

575
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:29,335
I'm so glad you could come.
- I didn't know you were in town.

576
01:19:29,794 --> 01:19:34,674
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge and thought
I'd catch up on your progress.

577
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:36,843
I'll tell you,

578
01:19:37,301 --> 01:19:39,512
the progress ain't too good.

579
01:19:40,304 --> 01:19:44,975
I've found out a lot of stuff,
but so far . . . no Johnny Favorite.

580
01:19:46,393 --> 01:19:50,772
How unfortunate! - All I've got is a
belly full of hocus-pocus and . . .

581
01:19:51,815 --> 01:19:52,816
3 stiffs.

582
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:57,070
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.

583
01:19:57,445 --> 01:19:58,446
Murders.

584
01:20:02,617 --> 01:20:07,163
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor,
bumped himself off.

585
01:20:07,705 --> 01:20:10,291
This old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.

586
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:14,670
He got choked to death with a part of
the body meant for pissing with . . .

587
01:20:15,629 --> 01:20:16,880
This is a church!

588
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:24,846
The whole thing has to do with
religion. It's very weird.

589
01:20:25,972 --> 01:20:27,974
I don't understand it. It's ugly.

590
01:20:28,474 --> 01:20:33,104
They say there's enough religion to
make men hate each other but not love.

591
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,605
Do they say that?

592
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:40,277
I'll tell you something. There wasn't
much love around for Johnny Favorite.

593
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:42,404
He was bad luck!

594
01:20:42,863 --> 01:20:47,325
It's starting to rub off on me. I'm a
murder suspect already in two cases.

595
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:51,413
The police found my name
and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.

596
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:56,751
I know, Winesap told me.
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.

597
01:20:57,627 --> 01:20:59,629
And the third murder?

598
01:21:00,087 --> 01:21:04,884
I checked out Johnny's old society
girlfriend, Margaret Krusemark.

599
01:21:05,384 --> 01:21:07,970
Do you know her?
- Vaguely.

600
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:12,349
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up
with fucking vaguely.

601
01:21:13,183 --> 01:21:16,686
"Vaguely" is putting a noose
around my neck and I'm choking, so . . .

602
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:19,773
Did you know her or not?

603
01:21:20,482 --> 01:21:23,359
I knew about her,
but I never actually knew her.

604
01:21:23,818 --> 01:21:26,404
Tell you what, she was doing my chart.

605
01:21:26,863 --> 01:21:30,116
I gave her Johnny's birthday,
February 14th.

606
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:35,746
Except someone got to her and
took out their own Valentine's card.

607
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:39,917
They slit her open
and cut out her heart.

608
01:21:40,834 --> 01:21:45,088
I guess she couldn't
predict the future for herself.

609
01:21:45,547 --> 01:21:47,924
The future isn't what it used to be.

610
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:50,301
And your conclusions?
- I haven't any.

611
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,305
All I know is that Johnny is running
around bumping off everyone he knew.

612
01:21:54,764 --> 01:21:57,975
And more and more,
it's me who's on the line for it.

613
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:01,353
I'm being set up
and it's scaring the shit out of me.

614
01:22:01,812 --> 01:22:05,899
So why don't you just level with me
and tell me what the fuck is going on?

615
01:22:06,817 --> 01:22:10,987
Just Johnny Favorite
and the debt that's owed to me.

616
01:22:11,446 --> 01:22:14,532
I have old-fashioned ideas,
about honour.

617
01:22:14,991 --> 01:22:17,827
An eye for an eye, things like that.

618
01:22:19,454 --> 01:22:21,289
Who the fuck are you?

619
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:22,999
Watch your language!

620
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:28,420
I don't give a fuck,
if this is a church.

621
01:22:28,879 --> 01:22:31,048
I don't like churches.
- Are you an atheist?

622
01:22:31,507 --> 01:22:34,510
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.

623
01:22:37,095 --> 01:22:40,348
I'll be in town for a day or two,
let me know what else you find,

624
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:43,059
and if you need more money . . .
- No!

625
01:22:43,518 --> 01:22:46,563
But if I'm not careful,
that 5,000 bucks you gave me could

626
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:49,899
buy me a seat on the electric chair.

627
01:23:28,727 --> 01:23:30,938
Frightened eyes never lie.

628
01:23:31,939 --> 01:23:34,149
Come on! Come inside!

629
01:23:42,031 --> 01:23:45,326
Where's your child?
- He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.

630
01:23:45,785 --> 01:23:48,871
She's got 14 of her own,
so he'll be okay there.

631
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:54,251
You're welcome to stay here,
or I can get you a room.

632
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,170
No, it's okay.

633
01:23:56,628 --> 01:23:59,881
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?

634
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:04,094
Well, have one anyway.

635
01:24:08,014 --> 01:24:10,099
I've been thinking . . .

636
01:24:10,558 --> 01:24:14,896
What the hell did your mother see in
a guy like Johnny Favorite?

637
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:19,233
I don't know. Whatever he had,
it sure stole her heart away.

638
01:24:20,234 --> 01:24:22,945
To tell you the truth,
the guy was a creep.

639
01:24:23,404 --> 01:24:25,739
She sure missed him.

640
01:24:26,365 --> 01:24:31,912
What does a lady see in a guy
who runs around chopping up pigeons?

641
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:37,250
They say it's always the bad-asses
who make a girl's heart beat faster.

642
01:24:40,169 --> 01:24:42,338
Did she ever say anything about him?

643
01:24:45,216 --> 01:24:47,843
Just two things.
- What?

644
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:54,850
That Johnny Favorite was as close to
true evil as she ever wanted to come.

645
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:57,352
What else?

646
01:24:58,186 --> 01:24:59,771
That he was a terrific lover.

647
01:25:05,235 --> 01:25:06,611
How old are you?

648
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,447
1 7.

649
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:13,367
Kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?

650
01:25:13,993 --> 01:25:16,120
Old enough.

651
01:25:17,788 --> 01:25:20,415
Where did the father go?
- I never knew him.

652
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,668
I'm sorry.

653
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:27,088
I don't know why I took this room.

654
01:25:28,214 --> 01:25:31,342
I can't believe this!

655
01:25:32,468 --> 01:25:37,306
It was a Bambouche. When spirits
possess you, it's called "chevalier."

656
01:25:37,682 --> 01:25:40,893
I know that: Chevrolet.

657
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:47,149
Chevalier. - That's what I said:
Chevrolet. - Mounted by the gods.

658
01:25:47,858 --> 01:25:52,446
So the gods got you pregnant?
I understand now. I'm sorry.

659
01:25:52,904 --> 01:25:54,948
I'm not.
It was the best fuck I ever had.

660
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,054
Want to dance?

661
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:21,139
Here?

662
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:22,807
Yes, here.

663
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:32,150
I got bit by a dog this morning,
I can't move around.

664
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:36,404
You won't feel a thing.

665
01:26:37,905 --> 01:26:39,532
Alright, I'll dance with you.

666
01:26:40,282 --> 01:26:42,951
But you've got to promise.
- What's that? - No chickens!

667
01:30:16,777 --> 01:30:18,946
Alright, I'm coming!

668
01:30:21,073 --> 01:30:23,242
I should've recognised the knock.

669
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:26,245
At least you got a reason
for sleeping late.

670
01:30:26,703 --> 01:30:30,832
Down here we don't mess with jigaboos.
The colored folks keep to themselves.

671
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:34,836
I'm not from down here.
- You cut yourself?

672
01:30:35,295 --> 01:30:36,296
Dog bit me.

673
01:30:37,297 --> 01:30:40,842
Somebody called Margaret Krusemark
figure in your missing persons case?

674
01:30:42,218 --> 01:30:45,805
No, why? - She's dead.
That nigger guitar player of yours,

675
01:30:46,263 --> 01:30:51,060
he didn't matter a shit. He was into
voodoo, they 86 each other every week.

676
01:30:51,518 --> 01:30:56,189
But this Krusemark dame, she comes
from a Louisiana money family.

677
01:30:56,648 --> 01:30:59,443
Two people bumped off in a week,
what's the connection?

678
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:01,903
Similar circumstances!

679
01:31:02,362 --> 01:31:04,781
Did she have her dick cut off too?
- No!

680
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,992
Some fucker cut her heart out,
neat as a butcher.

681
01:31:08,451 --> 01:31:11,704
Look, mine's
a missing persons, it's not a murder.

682
01:31:12,163 --> 01:31:16,667
I want the name of the party you're
looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.

683
01:31:17,126 --> 01:31:21,922
I did. A fancy mouthpiece, gave me the
same big city shit as you.

684
01:31:22,714 --> 01:31:26,802
What should I say? Why don't you and
Effie Klinker just fuck off

685
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:29,304
and leave me alone?
- You ass-wipe!

686
01:31:29,763 --> 01:31:32,599
You play jump rope with Louisiana law
and I'm going to stick

687
01:31:33,057 --> 01:31:35,768
your big city smarts
right up your New York ass.

688
01:31:36,477 --> 01:31:40,648
This Krusemark was into black magic
and all that shit.

689
01:31:41,107 --> 01:31:46,320
Nothing is worse for a cop than people
who get killed for nutso reasons.

690
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:52,117
Sorry about the mess.
Maybe your nigger can clean it up.

691
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:32,905
What are you singing?

692
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:38,577
It's by Johnny Favorite.
My mother used to sing it all the time.

693
01:32:42,164 --> 01:32:43,082
You okay?

694
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:42,819
Shit!

695
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,257
What do you want, Mr. Angel?

696
01:35:49,715 --> 01:35:52,760
I thought you knew.
- Why should l?

697
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:57,973
Two of your morons with a matching
poodle have been chasing me for days.

698
01:35:59,892 --> 01:36:01,810
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.

699
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:06,398
As far as I know,
that dance band scumbag is dead.

700
01:36:06,857 --> 01:36:10,693
That dance band scumbag
probably killed your daughter.

701
01:36:11,152 --> 01:36:15,323
Who is employing you?
- I can't say.

702
01:36:15,907 --> 01:36:18,659
I'll pay.
- So do they.

703
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:25,499
1 2 years ago, you and your daughter
snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.

704
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:30,629
You gave a junkie doctor 25 grand to
pretend Johnny was still there.

705
01:36:31,088 --> 01:36:33,256
You did a good job until a week ago.

706
01:36:35,133 --> 01:36:37,927
You used the name Edward Kelley.

707
01:36:40,638 --> 01:36:44,684
Let's go over here. It's a little
private and you can sample our Gumbo.

708
01:36:45,143 --> 01:36:49,980
I've got an acid stomach.
Cajun cooking kills me.

709
01:36:55,444 --> 01:36:59,031
Pity about your stomach!
You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.

710
01:37:18,007 --> 01:37:22,219
I was Edward Kelley.
It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.

711
01:37:23,178 --> 01:37:25,681
Did Favorite know you?
- No.

712
01:37:26,139 --> 01:37:30,101
He acted like a sleep walker. He looked
out of the window at the lights.

713
01:37:31,686 --> 01:37:36,441
Where were you taking him?
- Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.

714
01:37:36,941 --> 01:37:40,278
We dropped him off in the crowd,
and he disappeared forever.

715
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:42,780
Or so we thought.

716
01:37:43,239 --> 01:37:46,117
You're telling me you paid 25 grand
for a guy and lost him in a crowd?

717
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:48,285
I did it for my daughter.

718
01:37:48,744 --> 01:37:52,289
Some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny
were fooling with. She was obsessed.

719
01:37:52,748 --> 01:37:55,417
I know,
I found a mummified hand in her room.

720
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:59,671
The hand of glory.
It's supposed to open any lock.

721
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:04,008
It was the right hand of a murderer, cut
off while his neck was in the noose.

722
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:06,844
That's what Margaret believed.

723
01:38:07,303 --> 01:38:11,515
Black magic! - Black, white, what's the
difference? Margaret was always . . .

724
01:38:11,974 --> 01:38:14,393
Evil.
- Evil as a dunghill.

725
01:38:14,852 --> 01:38:19,189
Everyone speaks about someone else.
Margaret wasn't evil.

726
01:38:19,648 --> 01:38:24,361
She was a strange kid! She was into
Tarot cards before she could read.

727
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:28,490
Who got her started?
- Some maid, or governess, who knows.

728
01:38:28,948 --> 01:38:32,327
Everything you tell me
is a crock of shit!

729
01:38:32,785 --> 01:38:34,579
You got her started!

730
01:38:35,037 --> 01:38:39,875
You're a devil worshipper! - The Prince
of Darkness protects the powerful.

731
01:38:40,334 --> 01:38:42,336
Shit!
- I can't help if you don't believe it.

732
01:38:42,795 --> 01:38:46,882
Come straight with me, you slime-bag,
or I'll save the state an execution!

733
01:38:47,341 --> 01:38:50,385
I introduced
Johnny Favorite to my daughter.

734
01:38:50,844 --> 01:38:55,056
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my
home. He was deeper in it than me.

735
01:38:55,515 --> 01:38:58,434
He made a pact with Satan.
He sold his soul.

736
01:38:58,893 --> 01:39:01,979
You expect me to swallow that?
- I don't give a damn!

737
01:39:02,438 --> 01:39:05,858
That's a crock of shit,
you lying toad!

738
01:39:06,317 --> 01:39:10,112
He sold his soul for stardom.
- For stardom?

739
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:12,865
Satan rose from the depths.

740
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:16,118
But he tried to outwit
the Prince of Darkness.

741
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:19,830
When he made it big,
he tried to duck out of it.

742
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:21,790
That's a crock of shit!

743
01:39:22,249 --> 01:39:26,085
Johnny found an obscure rite in an
ancient manuscript. He needed a victim.

744
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:29,756
Someone his own age. - Why?
- To steal their soul.

745
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:32,800
Toots and Johnny
picked up a young soldier.

746
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:34,343
Who?
- Just a soldier

747
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,720
celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.

748
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:41,350
They took him back to Johnny's hotel,
where they had the ceremony.

749
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:42,893
What ceremony?

750
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:48,231
The boy was bound naked on a rubber mat,
there were complicated incantations.

751
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:50,734
A pentacle was branded on his chest.

752
01:39:51,192 --> 01:39:52,861
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.

753
01:39:53,319 --> 01:39:56,364
He sliced the boy clean open
and ate his heart.

754
01:39:57,699 --> 01:40:00,910
It was still beating
when he wolfed it down.

755
01:40:02,578 --> 01:40:04,663
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.

756
01:40:05,122 --> 01:40:07,458
Before he had worked it out,
he was drafted,

757
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:11,003
injured and sent home
without even knowing who he was.

758
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:13,338
Who was the boy?

759
01:40:13,797 --> 01:40:18,593
Only Johnny knew. He put the dog tags
in a vase and gave it to Margaret.

760
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:21,262
It was Margaret's plan
to drop him off in Times Square.

761
01:40:21,721 --> 01:40:24,474
The last place he remembered
before it happened.

762
01:40:28,936 --> 01:40:32,898
He needed a victim.
Someone his own age.

763
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:37,694
To steal their soul.

764
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:42,616
He sliced the boy clean open
and he ate his heart.

765
01:40:43,075 --> 01:40:44,993
Who was the boy?

766
01:40:46,202 --> 01:40:49,038
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.

767
01:40:50,874 --> 01:40:54,752
Maybe he gained the guy's soul,
but he still looked like Johnny to me.

768
01:43:17,303 --> 01:43:19,054
I know who I am!

769
01:43:39,866 --> 01:43:41,367
Alas . . .

770
01:43:44,453 --> 01:43:48,666
How terrible is wisdom if it brings
no profit to the wise, Johnny.

771
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:51,585
Louis Cyphre . . .

772
01:43:53,879 --> 01:43:55,213
"Lucifer!"

773
01:43:57,591 --> 01:44:00,385
Even your name is a dime store joke.

774
01:44:00,969 --> 01:44:04,639
"Mephistopheles" is
such a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.

775
01:44:05,098 --> 01:44:07,308
Do you think posing as the devil,

776
01:44:07,767 --> 01:44:11,812
just because it scared
a superstitious old guitar player,

777
01:44:12,271 --> 01:44:15,065
and that witch,
and that nutty old man,

778
01:44:15,733 --> 01:44:20,529
do you think it's going to scare me?
It ain't, because I know who I am.

779
01:44:21,405 --> 01:44:25,450
You killed them,
and you're trying to pin it on me.

780
01:44:26,034 --> 01:44:28,078
I know who I am.

781
01:44:28,912 --> 01:44:32,373
If I had cloven hooves and a tail,
would you be more convinced?

782
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:35,960
You're crazy.

783
01:44:36,419 --> 01:44:39,255
I know who I am.
You're trying to frame me.

784
01:44:40,006 --> 01:44:41,298
You're trying to frame me.

785
01:44:41,757 --> 01:44:46,303
I know who I am. You murdered them
people! I never killed nobody!

786
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:49,306
I didn't kill Fowler,

787
01:44:51,725 --> 01:44:53,685
I didn't kill Toots,

788
01:44:54,144 --> 01:44:57,063
and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.

789
01:44:57,522 --> 01:44:59,691
I killed no one.

790
01:45:00,150 --> 01:45:03,111
I'm afraid you did, Johnny.
- My name's not Johnny!

791
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:07,949
All killed by your own hand.
Guided by me, naturally.

792
01:45:08,449 --> 01:45:13,078
You were doomed from the moment
you slit that young boy in half.

793
01:45:14,246 --> 01:45:19,084
You've been living on borrowed time and
another man's memories for 1 2 years.

794
01:45:23,463 --> 01:45:27,717
I want to tell Winesap, he knows!
- He's dead.

795
01:45:28,927 --> 01:45:29,969
Nasty accident!

796
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:37,393
Don't worry, no one will mourn one less
lawyer. Death's everywhere these days.

797
01:45:39,812 --> 01:45:43,565
But what gives
human life its worth, anyway?

798
01:45:44,316 --> 01:45:47,235
Because someone loves it, hates it.

799
01:45:47,694 --> 01:45:51,865
The flesh is weak.
Only the soul is immortal.

800
01:45:57,495 --> 01:46:00,123
And yours belongs to me!

801
01:46:05,044 --> 01:46:06,837
I know who I am.

802
01:46:10,924 --> 01:46:14,177
That's it Johnny, take a good look!

803
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:18,431
However cleverly you
sneak up on the mirror, your reflection

804
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:22,685
always looks you straight in the eye.
- I know who I am.

805
01:46:53,464 --> 01:46:55,466
I know who I am!

806
01:48:07,826 --> 01:48:09,452
Why did you come back?

807
01:48:19,796 --> 01:48:21,672
I live here.

808
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:24,884
Who is she?

809
01:48:27,303 --> 01:48:30,639
She ain't: Angel, Harold.

810
01:48:33,225 --> 01:48:35,102
She's my daughter.

811
01:48:35,727 --> 01:48:38,438
Bullshit! Who is she?

812
01:48:39,606 --> 01:48:42,609
Epiphany Proudfoot.

813
01:48:43,401 --> 01:48:45,903
She stayed here for a little while.

814
01:48:48,447 --> 01:48:52,993
Long enough for you to kill her?
Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?

815
01:49:10,718 --> 01:49:12,512
You're going to burn for this.

816
01:49:15,431 --> 01:49:16,807
I know.

817
01:49:19,852 --> 01:49:21,479
In hell!
