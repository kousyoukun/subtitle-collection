1
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,914
How are you?

2
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,382
Hello?

3
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,843
Yes, this is Harold Angel.

4
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,220
Yep, middle initial "R" just
like in the phone book.

5
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,140
Excuse me? Winesap.

6
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,520
Herman Winesap of
Winesap and Mackintosh.

7
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,023
Hold on a second.

8
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:18,114
Okay, Winesap.. of
Winesap and Mackintosh.

9
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,699
Okay, I got it.

10
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,496
Of course I know
what an attorney is.

11
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,499
Yeah, it's like a lawyer,
only the bills are bigger.

12
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,005
Sure, I'll hold. Asshole.

13
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,640
Mr. Winesap, yeah, Harold Angel.

14
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,020
Well, yeah, I could be free.

15
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,189
Would this be with your firm?

16
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,527
Okay, give me that again.

17
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,907
Louis.

18
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,909
How do you spell that?

19
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,538
Cyphre. Okay. What
is it, foreign?

20
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,542
A foreigner? Is your client
a foreign gentleman?

21
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,379
Okay.

22
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,007
Mr. Winesap, could you give
me a few more details?

23
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,512
Okay. No, I know the place.

24
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,599
It's a long way up,
but I can be there.

25
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,912
Hallelujah!

26
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,666
Permit me to be
transmittable, hallelujah.

27
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,294
Permit me to be
reincarnatable, hallelujah.

28
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,006
Permit me to be
reproducible, hallelujah.

29
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:04,262
For His kingdom is
yours, today, right now.

30
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:09,434
Hallelujah. Follow me.
Follow me through his paths.

31
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,104
Hallelujah. I want you to show
right now how much you love God.

32
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,315
I want you to show
as your tithe.

33
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,235
I want you to open up your
hearts and open up your wallets.

34
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,739
And open up your purses.
And open up your pockets.

35
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,241
And give it up. Praise the Lord.

36
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:29,704
Somebody's been talkin' about me, about
I've been riding around in a Cadillac.

37
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,415
If you love me, and you
wanna give to me..

38
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,876
then I should be
in a Rolls Royce.

39
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,422
Let's hear it, Brother.
Let's go. Yes!

40
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,966
Hey! Hey! Come on.

41
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,263
- Mr. Angel?
- Yeah.

42
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,558
Herman Winesap.

43
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,810
Would you come with me, please?

44
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,074
An unfortunate husband..

45
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,328
of one of Pastor John's flock
took a gun to his head.

46
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,330
Most unpleasant.

47
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,833
Mr. Angel? Please?

48
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,107
Mr. Angel.

49
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:45,905
Allow me to introduce my
client, Monsieur Louis Cyphre.

50
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,449
Hiya. Harry Angel.

51
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,034
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.

52
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:57,959
I don't want to appear rude or impolite,
but do you have any I.D., before we begin?

53
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,002
Sure. Yeah. Here.

54
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,257
Let me see what I got here.

55
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,467
How's that?

56
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,397
Nothing personal. It's just
that I'm a little overcautious.

57
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,150
- You know how these things are.
- Oh, I know.

58
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:27,738
So, how did you hear about me?

59
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,832
I guess you guys just looked
in the phone book, huh?

60
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,546
Usually that's what happens.

61
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,007
Because my name is Angel.
It's under A's.

62
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,301
People..You know,
people are lazy.

63
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,344
They flick through. They see
the first name in the book.

64
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,472
- Johnny Favorite.
- Excuse me?

65
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,976
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

66
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,187
Remember the name Johnny?
No, I don't think so.

67
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,691
- You never knew him?
- Am I supposed to know him?

68
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,777
He was a crooner before the war.
Quite famous in his way.

69
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,616
I'll tell ya, Mr. "Cyphre,"
you know, I..

70
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,784
Mr. Cyphre.

71
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,287
I'm sorry, beg.. I'm sorry.

72
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,251
Mr. Cyphres. I usually don't get
involved in anything really heavy.

73
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,547
I usually handle
small-time stuff:

74
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,217
insurance jobs, divorces,
things of that nature.

75
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,055
I get lucky, sometimes
I handle people.

76
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:38,142
But I don't know no,
you know, crooners..

77
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,728
or anybody famous, you know?

78
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,899
- His real name was Liebling.
- I don't..

79
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,277
I don't know any
Liebling either.

80
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,279
So what is it you
guys want from me?

81
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,115
- Does this man owe you money?
- Not quite.

82
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,369
I gaveJohnny some help at the
beginning of his career.

83
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,665
So were you, like, his agent?

84
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,710
No, no, no. Nothing so..

85
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,881
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.

86
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,760
Certain collateral was involved, to be
forfeited in the event of his death.

87
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,262
You're losin' me a little bit. Are
we talkin' about a guy who's dead?

88
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,474
No, he was drafted in '43.
North Africa.

89
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:22,061
Special Entertainment Services.
There was an attack.

90
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,355
He was badly injured
about the head and face.

91
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,693
- He had..
- Amnesia, I think you call it.

92
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,946
- Shell shock?
- Shell shock. Yes.

93
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,408
- I know how that feels.
- Why? Were you in the services?

94
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,451
Yes, I was in for a
short period of time.

95
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,790
But I got a little fucked up real quick.
Excuse my language.

96
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,834
And they shipped me back home..

97
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,253
and I sort of missed
the whole shebang.

98
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,464
You know, the war, the medals,
the whole nine yards.

99
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,550
And I guess you could
say I was lucky.

100
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,512
Johnny wasn't so lucky. He
returned home a virtual zombie.

101
00:09:56,595 --> 00:10:01,350
Favorite's friends had him transferred
to a private hospital upstate.

102
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,229
There was some sort of radical
psychiatric treatment involved.

103
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:08,149
Favorite's lawyers had the
power of attorney to..

104
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,652
Pay the bills, things like that.
But you know how these things are.

105
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,488
He remained a vegetable, and
my contract was never honored.

106
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,240
I see.

107
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,577
I don't want to sound mercenary or
anything, but you must understand..

108
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,747
that my interest in Johnny is only
in finding out if he's alive..

109
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,041
or if he's dead.

110
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,628
Each year my office receives a
signed affidavit confirming..

111
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,174
that Johnny Liebling is
indeed among the living.

112
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,135
Until this last weekend,
when quite by chance..

113
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:41,015
Monsieur Cyphre and I were in the vicinity
of the hospital just outside Poughkeepsie.

114
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:45,436
We decided to check for ourselves but
were given misleading information.

115
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,273
- Yeah, the runaround.
- Yes. I didn't want to cause a scene.

116
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,567
I hate to have any
sort of a fuss.

117
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,028
So I thought perhaps you could..

118
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,573
subtly, in a more quiet manner..

119
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,284
- You want me to check it out.
- Check it out.

120
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,664
Okay. Yeah.

121
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,461
It's funny. I have a feeling
I've met you before.

122
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,963
I don't know. I don't think so.

123
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,897
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

124
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,822
His real name was Liebling.

125
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:47,164
My interest in Johnny is only in finding
out if he's alive or if he's dead.

126
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,750
- May I help you?
- Yes.

127
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:37,047
My name is Harry Conroy, and I'm with
the National Institute of Health.

128
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,510
Is there anyone in particular
you'd like to see, Mr. Conroy?

129
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,265
The Institute is conducting a
survey of incurable trauma cases..

130
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:50,394
and I understand you have a patient
here fitting that description.

131
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,106
I'm afraid we can't let you see
anyone without an appointment, sir.

132
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,983
Oh, sure. I appreciate that.
But maybe, you know..

133
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,820
you could check the files and
make sure I'm on the right track.

134
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,407
I don't want to bother
anybody unnecessarily.

135
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,826
Okay? Thank you.

136
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,122
- What's the name of the patient?
- Liebling.Jonathan Liebling.

137
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,250
One moment please. I will check.

138
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,840
So, was you workin'
here last weekend?

139
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,884
No. Day off.

140
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,222
- Did you do anything nice?
- My sister's wedding.

141
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,684
We did have a Mr. Liebling..

142
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,020
but it says here he
was transferred.

143
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,105
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's what it says here.

144
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:40,527
- When was that?
- Years ago. December '43.

145
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,947
May I take a look at this?
Thank you.

146
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,744
- Is this recent?
- It's an old file.

147
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:53,374
It's in ballpoint. You know, they
weren't too big on ballpoint in '43.

148
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,834
- Is that ballpoint?
- Yeah.

149
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,213
Well, I'll be. They didn't
have ballpoints back then?

150
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,969
This here Dr. Fowler..

151
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,971
does he still work here?

152
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,640
Just part-time. He's old.

153
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,103
Thank you.

154
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,470
About time for your evening fix?

155
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,851
Who are you? How'd
you get in here?

156
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,147
Through the mail slot.
I'm a private detective.

157
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,651
Breaking and entering is a serious
crime, whoever or whatever you are.

158
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,779
Hey, man, call the police.

159
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,824
Which you won't do in case they
discover your little opium den..

160
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,326
you got in the icebox there.

161
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:28,005
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled
to keep pharmaceuticals at home.

162
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,424
Hey, look, Doc, tell it to
somebody else, all right?

163
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,261
We're not talkin' about a
Band-Aid and two Bongateen.

164
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,014
- How long you been hooked?
- What do you want of me?

165
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,350
Information about
Johnny Liebling.

166
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,146
I vaguely remember treating a patient
of that name many years ago.

167
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,232
Hey, look, Doc, I'm not
foolin' around here.

168
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,906
Either you start giving me some straight
answers, or I'll call the police myself.

169
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,868
I've seen the works cookin' upstairs,
pal, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.

170
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,079
I remember. He was in detainer
during the war. Neuro case.

171
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,584
No chance of recovery. So we transferred
him to a V.A. hospital in Albany.

172
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,337
Hey, Doc, I hate to shake you
up, but I checked with Albany.

173
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,715
He's not there. You
faked the transfer.

174
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,343
I did that quickly because
he had a visitor recently.

175
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,595
In 12 years, he
hadn't had a visitor.

176
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,224
Popular guy, huh?

177
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,770
- Where is he now?
- I honestly don't know.

178
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,064
Look. Come here.

179
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,816
I haven't seen him since he
was a patient in the war.

180
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,279
Look, Doc, you're in a cold sweat.
Look at you.

181
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,575
You can't wait for me to leave here so
you can raid the goodies in the icebox.

182
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,912
Now, the sooner you
get out with it..

183
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:46,124
the sooner you can shoot
yourself to Palookaville, okay?

184
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,585
I'm gonna ask you again.

185
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,923
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

186
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,467
Some people came one
night many years ago.

187
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,387
He got in the car with him & drove away.
I never saw him again.

188
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,014
He got into a car? I thought
this guy was a vegetable.

189
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,143
When he first came here, he was
in a coma, but he soon recovered.

190
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,229
But he still suffered
from acute amnesia.

191
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,817
The friends? Who
were the friends?

192
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,194
The gentleman's name was Kelly.
Edward Kelly.

193
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,989
The young lady, I
don't know her.

194
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,866
- She stayed in the car.
- Where were they taking him?

195
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,995
I think down south. The man
said, "We're taking him home."

196
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,872
- What was the deal?
- $25,000.

197
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,999
For what?

198
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,960
To maintain the pretense that he was
still a patient in the hospital.

199
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,254
Didn't the
administration suspect?

200
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,507
But why should they? I kept
the charts up to date..

201
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,052
and no one asks questions
when the bills get paid.

202
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,806
I want you to tell me
about Johnny Liebling.

203
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,351
- What did he look like?
- I have no idea what he looked like.

204
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,480
His face was damaged. He had
extensive facial reconstruction.

205
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,108
He was still in bandages
the day he left.

206
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,736
Tell me about this guy Kelly.

207
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,739
- It's so long. I have only a vague memory.
- Come on.

208
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,909
I can't remember. He was well-dressed.
He had a southern accent.

209
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,911
- I..
- What?

210
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,164
- Truly can't remember.
- All right, Doc. All right.

211
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,791
Hey. We're gonna have a
little lie-down, all right?

212
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,586
I'm gonna go out, and I'm
gonna grab a cheeseburger.

213
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,882
Maybe a few hours cold turkey will
refresh your memory. All right?

214
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,801
Come on.

215
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,475
Watch yourself there.

216
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,561
Okay, Doc. We're gonna
take a little nap now.

217
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,897
Sit your ass down.

218
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,108
I'm gonna clear your
mind a little bit.

219
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,527
I'm gonna go out. Maybe
when I get back..

220
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,906
I'll fix you some goodies
from the icebox, all right?

221
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,576
Listen, you tell me what I want to
know, I'll be out ofyour hair forever.

222
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,571
Johnny.

223
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,658
Harry. Harry.

224
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,081
Harry.

225
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,360
Hey, I'm back, Doc. I brought
you a little somethin'.

226
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,784
I didn't think you'd want a
cheeseburger and a shake.

227
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,665
- I won't. Bye.
- Bye.

228
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,168
- Hey, Allie.
- Hey, Harry.

229
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,295
That your boyfriend?

230
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,797
- He got a car and everything?
- Yeah.

231
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,799
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

232
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,261
- Bye.
- See you later.

233
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,634
- Did you see him?
- No.

234
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,803
- Why not?
- 'Cause it would have been difficult.

235
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,515
- Why?
- Why? 'Cause he's not there.

236
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:04,562
Your Johnny Favorite walked out of
Sarah Harvest Dodd's 12 years ago..

237
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,774
wearin' his best suit and a
new face wrapped in bandages.

238
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,110
With a headache.

239
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:13,196
He took off with some guy
called Kelly and a girl.

240
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,992
Do you know this Kelly?

241
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,328
It seems that this
guy Kelly paid off..

242
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:25,458
some bent doctor called Fowler to
pinch-hit for your guy all these years.

243
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,211
He's been coverin' up
for him ever since.

244
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,930
It looks like ourJohnny has found
himself a perfect disappearing act.

245
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,099
It seems so.

246
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,770
You know what they
say about slugs.

247
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,107
No, what do they
say about slugs?

248
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,068
They always leave slime
in their tracks.

249
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,829
- You'll find him.
- No, I won't find him.

250
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,376
'Cause I left out
one little detail.

251
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,174
This Dr. Fowler guy ended up dead with
his fuckin' brains blown out all over.

252
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,676
- Fowler?
- Yeah, Fowler.

253
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,345
- Did you kill him?
- No, I didn't kill him.

254
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,473
But the cops might think I did.

255
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,145
Hey, look. I took on $125 a day
missing persons job with you.

256
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,982
Now I'm a murder suspect.
That's it. I'm out.

257
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:36,071
Such are the hazards of
your profession, Mr. Angel.

258
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,490
If the fee bothers you,
we can have it adjusted.

259
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,118
No, Cyphre, you bother me. Listen,
the closest I ever come..

260
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,538
to death is standin' on the corner on
2nd Avenue watching the stiffs go by..

261
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,958
in the hearse, all right,
that's the way I like it.

262
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,087
Are you afraid?

263
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,423
Yeah, I'm afraid.

264
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,512
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately
to send you a check for $5,000.

265
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,599
If you don't want the job,
I'll engage someone else.

266
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,981
- $5,000?
- $5,000.

267
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,487
You must want this
Johnny pretty bad.

268
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,865
I don't like messy accounts.

269
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:30,625
You know, some religions think that
the egg is the symbol of the soul.

270
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,378
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

271
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,052
Would you like an egg?

272
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,351
No, thank you. I got a
thing about chickens.

273
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,574
Gavilan weighs 146 pounds
tonight, just a pound..

274
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,451
under the welterweight limit.

275
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,497
Turner weighs 144 1|2.

276
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,585
I t's a $270,000 gate, an all-time
record for the welterweight title.

277
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,131
It's after 11:00, Harry.
You're late.

278
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,843
I'm sorry. Did you get it?

279
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:55,348
If I lose my job, I'll come
and be your secretary.

280
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,768
Hey, I couldn't pay you what the Times
pays. Besides, they're not gonna miss it.

281
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,729
They must be digging up stuff
like this all the time.

282
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,107
Hiya, Johnny. Where
the fuck are you?

283
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,360
Johnny Favorite was a
crooner, like you said.

284
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,028
I didn't realize he was so big.

285
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,657
He used to be in a band called
the Spider Simpson orchestra.

286
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,202
- All dead. Only Spider's here in town.
- Oh, yeah? Where is he?

287
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,579
I wrote it all down.

288
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,249
The dyke in Archiving's library
is getting suspicious.

289
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,626
My boss hasn't researched
a story in years.

290
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,711
You can get the files.

291
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:30,216
Spider's in an old people's
home on 138th Street.

292
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,218
Oh, wonderful. I get
to go to Harlem again.

293
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,012
There was a picture of Johnny
with a guy called Toots Sweet.

294
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,556
- A guitar player.
- And?

295
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,226
No one's heard of him for years.
Now here's the juicy bit.

296
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,563
He was engaged to a rich broad,
name of Margaret Krusemark.

297
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,189
Dad Ethan owns
half of Louisiana.

298
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,609
Met Johnny at a high school
prom in New Orleans.

299
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,279
Johnny shit on her, and she
went back home to Daddy.

300
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,782
- Oh, yeah, there's lots on her spells.
- Spells?

301
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,118
What do you mean, spells?

302
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:01,622
You mean like eye of a newt and
toe of a frog, that kind of shit?

303
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,624
Seems she's a bit of a crackpot.

304
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,003
Casting spells at
society dos and stuff.

305
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,756
Didn't go down too well with
the lvy League stiffos.

306
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,386
Oh, yeah, she was known as
the Witch of Wellesley.

307
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,722
The Witch of Wellesley.

308
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,267
- Did I do good?
- Yeah, you did great.

309
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,104
So, what do I got? I got some kind
of religious loony for a client.

310
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,941
I gotta find Johnny
Golden Tonsils.

311
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,195
We don't know where he is. He
probably doesn't know who he is.

312
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,074
I got a geriatric bandleader
at a home in Harlem.

313
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,412
I got a guitar player
called Toots Sweet.

314
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,832
- What else I got?
- A hard-on.

315
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,340
Are you okay?

316
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,879
January 3, 1955.

317
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,382
Louis Cyphre.

318
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,094
Winesap and Mackintosh,
attorneys.

319
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,055
As reported, Johnny
Favorite has not been..

320
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:46,018
in the Sarah Dodd Nursing Home of
Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.

321
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:50,606
He was taken away by a man
called Edward Kelly and a girl.

322
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,109
The girl is unidentified.

323
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:57,238
Kelly paid a Dr. Fowler
$25,000 to falsify reports..

324
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,408
stating Favorite was
still at the hospital.

325
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:10,376
The doctor is now deceased.

326
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,589
Before Johnny's accident, it seemed
his career was goin' great..

327
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,508
till he started to dump
on everyone around him.

328
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,679
I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader.

329
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,849
Spider now resides at the
Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice..

330
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,936
for the Elderly,
on 138th Street.

331
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,566
Johnny also had a close buddy, a
guitarplayer called Toots Sweet.

332
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,568
Toots went back to Algiers.

333
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:39,655
That ain't Algiers in Africa.
That's Algiers in New Orleans.

334
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:44,744
I think maybe Margaret went back
there too, and maybe Johnny.

335
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:49,999
Oh, yeah. According to Spider,
Johnny had a secret love.

336
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,045
A black lady called
Evangeline Proudfoot.

337
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,924
Evangeline ran some kind of
spooky store in Harlem..

338
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,469
called Mammy Carter's.

339
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,019
You don't need to
know that, Cyphre.

340
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:15,316
I think secret loves
should stay secret.

341
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,862
And the only other person
Johnny was seeing regularly..

342
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:24,992
was a palm reader out in Coney
Island called Madame Zora.

343
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:47,890
Hey, you Izzy?

344
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:49,892
Yeah.

345
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:53,312
- It looks like the last of the sun, huh?
- Yep.

346
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,649
Hey, listen. The guy in the arcade over
there told me you might be able to help.

347
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,859
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

348
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,861
I'm lookin' for a Madame Zora.

349
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,281
Yeah, sure, I know her. A friend
of the wife before the war.

350
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,159
- It's the fortune teller, right?
- Yeah, and then some.

351
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:11,247
Real creepy. I hate those
hocus-pocus bitches. Fuckin' witch.

352
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,249
Her and the wife got
along real well.

353
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,251
The wife's a Baptist. Oh, here.

354
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:20,005
Have a nose shield.
Go on. Take one.

355
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,216
I found a whole box fell
under the boardwalk.

356
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,845
There's not much sun
in the city right now.

357
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
Yeah, but it keeps
the rain off too.

358
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,642
Hey, listen. You ever hear
of a Johnny Favorite?

359
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,519
- The singer?
- The crooner.

360
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,438
Used to visit Madame
Zora all the time?

361
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,982
I heard of him, but I don't
know nothin' about him.

362
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,360
Ask the wife. She'll know. She's always
singin' stupid tunes off the radio.

363
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,779
She knows all that kind of shit.

364
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,657
- She likes the water, huh?
- Nope. Hates it.

365
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,161
She's gettin' on the heavy side. She
thinks it's good for varicose veins.

366
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,207
All right. Thanks.

367
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,085
Listen. What do you do around
here in the summertime?

368
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,757
- I bite the heads off of rats.
- What do you do in the winter?

369
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,176
Same.

370
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,857
Excuse me!

371
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,444
I was just talkin' to
your husband over there!

372
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,739
I was inquiring about
a Madame Zora!

373
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,117
Yeah, I knew her before the war.
Madame Zora, you say?

374
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,120
Yeah, she was some kind
of gypsy fortune-teller.

375
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,582
Yeah, she used to have the booth
across the boardwalk from me.

376
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,502
She weren't no gypsy.
She was a debutante.

377
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,796
She was messin' with more
than readin' tea leaves.

378
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,090
Did you ever see her with a
guy called Johnny Favorite?

379
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:50,471
Yeah, he was cute. Used to visit her
all the time. She was real stuck on him.

380
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,517
The guy with the golden tonsils, they
used to call him. I knew all his tunes.

381
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,853
Hey, did you ever hear of a..
of a Margaret Krusemark?

382
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:03,234
Don't be a gazoony, fella. Madame
Zora was Margaret Krusemark.

383
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,570
What happened to her?

384
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:11,951
Packed up her stuff one day & closed up
for good. Went back home. Down south.

385
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,454
Do you have any idea where I
could find Johnny Favorite?

386
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,957
Nope. Maybe the cemetery.

387
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,459
Wanna hear one of his tunes?

388
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:25,297
I cried for you

389
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,802
Now it's your turn to cry over..

390
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,388
Hey, thanks for the nose shield.

391
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,223
- Okay.
- I'm gonna need it where I'm goin'.

392
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,475
- In Brooklyn?
- Nah. Louisiana.

393
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,560
Nice.

394
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,397
Where'd he go?

395
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,075
Mr. Angel.

396
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,369
Sorry to keep you waitin'.
You're a little early.

397
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,914
I had a bad line. I didn't
know if it was 4:00 or 4:30.

398
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,339
Wow, this is really a
wild place you got here.

399
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,759
Yes, I've been very happy here.

400
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,136
Hey, you know, I never had
my fortune read before.

401
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,598
- Does this take long?
- I'll just take the details now.

402
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,267
It usually takes me a couple
of days to do a chart.

403
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,607
Tea?

404
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,111
- Do you want some tea?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

405
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,661
Darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?

406
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,583
- Oolong.
- Not many people like oolong.

407
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,595
You play the piano?

408
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,264
No, not exactly.

409
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,809
Sing?

410
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,979
I can carry a tune,
but not really.

411
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:58,028
So, who's this mean-looking guy?

412
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,823
It's my father.

413
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,908
I'm sorry.

414
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,077
Don't worry. He hates it too.

415
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,414
You know, he really looks like one of
those guys in an old pirate movie.

416
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,999
What's his name?

417
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:15,546
- Ethan.
- Ethan. Ethan Krusemark.

418
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,465
I'll tell ya, you know, I never
saw any of Ethan's movies.

419
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,645
Do you speak French, Mr. Angel?

420
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,733
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke.

421
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,528
Oh, that's okay.

422
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:44,491
- Cream or sugar?
- No. Straight up is fine, thank you.

423
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,369
Now. I'm gonna need your
exact date of birth.

424
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:49,371
Sure.

425
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:51,540
Okay, I was..

426
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,168
born February 14.

427
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,341
1918. That's Valentine's Day.

428
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,137
How curious.

429
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,265
I used to know a boy who was
born on that exact same date.

430
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,933
Really?

431
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:14,146
You know how it is. All the
soldiers home on leave and all.

432
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:18,692
Hey, maybe we could pull your friend's
chart and save ourselves some time.

433
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,153
I don't think so, Mr. Angel.

434
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:25,365
Every person's very different. I
don't think you'd like his chart.

435
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:31,413
- Place of birth?
- Brooklyn, New York.

436
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:33,874
Why, was he a jerk or
something, your friend?

437
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,543
Yeah, you could say that.

438
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:43,717
So, I guess you just didn't get along.
You and Johnny.

439
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,892
You and Johnny Favorite?

440
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,193
Who are you?

441
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,445
I was an old army buddy.

442
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:06,990
I thought that you two
were kind of a..You know.

443
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,202
All right. Look. I
ain't no army buddy.

444
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,537
I'm just a guy who was
paid to snoop around.

445
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,917
But to tell you the truth, I
wasn't born on Valentine's Day.

446
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,379
lt'sJohnny's future
that I'm interested in.

447
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:24,007
Johnny has no future. He's dead.

448
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,302
He died 12 years ago, and
Mr. Angel, I'd like you to leave.

449
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:32,391
Look, I know you're probably thinking
who's this creep lookin' to snitch around.

450
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,102
I don't want to sound
nosy or nothin', but..

451
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:39,398
He's dead, Mr. Angel. And
if he isn't, he is to me.

452
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:43,068
Wow. He must've hurt
you pretty bad.

453
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,571
We all have our
scars, Mr. Angel.

454
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,949
Look. You know, I don't know
too much about this guy..

455
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,910
but he must've been really
stupid if he let you go.

456
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:56,581
Lies and cruelty come very easy to
some people. Good-bye, Mr. Angel.

457
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,460
It's a pity. You know, I really would've
liked to have gotten my palm read.

458
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,380
Could've held your hand
a little while longer.

459
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,093
I don't think you'd
like what I see.

460
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:15,183
That's a very pretty
necklace you got there.

461
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

462
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,137
You got any Hygeia
the Conqueror root?

463
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,766
- Powdered or hanging?
- I don't know. I'm not really sure.

464
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:59,353
- Caught in the rain, huh?
- Yeah.

465
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,857
Two roots. $1.20.

466
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,111
Listen, I have a question
I wanna ask you.

467
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,323
I have an acquaintance
back in Harlem..

468
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,368
who used to deal in Hygeia
the Conqueror root.

469
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,245
And her name was Evangeline.
Did you ever hear of her?

470
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,499
Practically everyone around here
is called Evangeline, mister.

471
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,584
After the poem. You
know the poem?

472
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,671
Yeah, I know the poem. This..

473
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:31,176
This acquaintance of mine had a store
in Harlem. It was the same name. Carter.

474
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:36,264
Everybody uses the name, mister. Like
Howard Johnson? This is the real place.

475
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:41,937
Her name was Proudfoot,
Evangeline Proudfoot.

476
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,690
Yeah, I knew her.

477
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,360
She used to come back here all the
time when she was livin' in New York.

478
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,695
Do you know where she is now?

479
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:55,075
She got sick. Died. Went
back to Holy Shelter Swamp.

480
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,537
They buried her in Almondville.
She was waitin' on some fella.

481
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,706
- Just like in the poem, huh?
- Just like the poem.

482
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,750
$1.20.

483
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,255
Who was the guy?

484
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,132
She never told.

485
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,095
Okay, thanks.

486
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,272
- A week, you say?
- Yeah, at most.

487
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:26,666
What you crying for? What? What?

488
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,835
What you crying for?

489
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,756
Let's go see Grandma.
Who's over there?

490
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,717
It's Grandma. Grandma.

491
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,900
Let's go.

492
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,819
Give me your hand.

493
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,097
Soap.

494
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,448
Excuse me?

495
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:46,162
- Miss Proudfoot?
- Yeah.

496
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,293
Oh, I'm sorry. I got
these from some guy..

497
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,421
and it's funny how some
babies react to 'em.

498
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:59,926
- I'm sorry.
- Stop crying.

499
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:06,308
Listen, I was hoping maybe I
could talk with your mama.

500
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:10,270
Yeah? You're a little late for that.
Did you know her?

501
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,731
No, I've never met her,
but I was hoping..

502
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,442
maybe she could answer a
few questions for me.

503
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:19,863
- What are you? Some kind of cop?
- No. My name's Harry Angel.

504
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:24,117
How are you? I'm a
private detective.

505
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,411
- So what's..
- Epiphany.

506
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,663
- Epiphany?
- Yeah.

507
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,001
Your mama left you with a very
beautiful name, Epiphany.

508
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,836
Not much else.

509
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,591
Actually, to be quite frank,
I'm looking for a friend..

510
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,469
of your mama's, a guy
called Johnny Favorite.

511
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,763
Yeah? I met all of
mama's friends.

512
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,473
I never met anyone
called Favorite.

513
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:53,146
Jesus. Oh, shit! I got a
thing about chickens.

514
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,652
Yeah. This guy Favorite..

515
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,364
he was friends with your mama, back
in New York City, before the war.

516
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,866
Yeah? She never told me.

517
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:07,410
My mama had a lot of guys.
She liked men.

518
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,205
How 'bout a guy
named Toots Sweet?

519
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,957
He was a friend of Favorite's.
Did you ever meet him?

520
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,585
He was supposed to be a
pretty good guitar player.

521
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,879
I was gonna go try to
catch his act tonight.

522
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,928
Listen, I'm gonna be stayin'
here in town, in a hotel.

523
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:29,265
And I figured if maybe, if you could
remember anything that might help me..

524
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,435
maybe you could give me a call.

525
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:43,697
You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany.
Your name suits you.

526
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,577
Chickens.

527
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,878
Hey, what are you after him for?
Johnny Favorite?

528
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:03,550
I'm not really after him. I'm just
being paid to find out where he is.

529
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,593
He could be six feet under.

530
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,472
Then I'll have to buy a shovel.

531
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:26,406
She had two cups of coffee

532
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:33,580
And I had one small cup of tea

533
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,960
She just walked out of my life

534
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,757
Left them low-down
dirty blues with me

535
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,890
 it was on

536
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:56,227
Oh, Lord, it was on

537
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,313
On a rainy day

538
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:01,024
One time for Toots

539
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:06,070
I t was on

540
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,741
- Oh, Lord it was on
- How's it hangin', sugar?

541
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,785
On a rainy day

542
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:18,249
Go ahead.

543
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:43,441
Hey, that was some beautiful tune you
were singing in there, Mr. Sweet.

544
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,444
- Toots, son. Thank you.
- Yeah, listen. Can I buy you a drink?

545
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,738
No, I get mine on the house.
Two Sisters cocktails.

546
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,350
Don't know what's in 'em, but I get a bigger
kick out of 'em than I do six stingers.

547
00:56:52,433 --> 00:56:55,920
Listen. You know that I heard
you play years ago in New York?

548
00:56:56,003 --> 00:56:58,765
Yeah, it was before the war
at the old Dicky Wells bar.

549
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,767
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

550
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,855
You was hammin' it up pretty good
with some cat called Johnny Favorite.

551
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:07,399
Yeah, I vaguely remember
playin' with that guy once.

552
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,202
Yeah, you and him was
buddies, weren't you?

553
00:57:10,285 --> 00:57:13,688
No. He made a record of one of my
songs, but that don't make us buddies.

554
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:15,807
Say, are you a dick
or book writer?

555
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,393
I'm neither. What I
am, I'm a journalist.

556
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,645
You see, what I'm doing
is, I'm doing this piece.

557
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:24,357
The piece is on Johnny and the
old Spider Simpson Orchestra.

558
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,319
I remember Spider. He used to play them
drums like two jack rabbits fuckin'.

559
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,988
Got to go, son. Ain't
got much time.

560
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,992
A piss and a spit and back to work. Try
one of them Two Sisters cocktails..

561
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,536
and then you can make the whole
thing up, any way you want to.

562
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,956
That's what you newspaper
people do anyway, don't you?

563
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:52,719
He starts his lovin'
when you get through

564
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,478
Can't even take a piss.

565
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,772
Hey, look, pal. I just wanted
to have a little talk..

566
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,066
with you about Johnny Favorite
and Evangeline Proud..

567
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,502
I'm too big to go hidin' under beds.
I don't know nothin'.

568
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:13,706
Two Sisters cocktails are the only thing
I'm interested in nowadays. Fuck!

569
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,548
- What's going on, Toots?
- Nothing.

570
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,135
Mind your own business.
I wanna piss.

571
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:37,388
Ifyou don't get the hell out of here,
I mean clean out on the sidewalk..

572
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,515
you gonna wish your little
white ass never was born.

573
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,768
Please. I got a thing
about chickens.

574
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:47,023
So take a tip, honey
and just leave my door

575
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:51,819
Because your key don't
fit in my lock no more

576
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,280
You got the right key

577
00:58:54,364 --> 00:59:00,578
You're knockin '
on the wrong door

578
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,010
All right, now. Hey.

579
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:47,013
This is the end of
bullshit time, pal, okay?

580
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,056
I got a good look at
you and Epiphany..

581
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,852
doin' your hot-shoe
number with the chicken.

582
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,729
And listen.

583
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:58,024
I ain't up on all this voodoo shit.
I'm from Brooklyn.

584
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,776
We ain't all Baptists
down here, sonny.

585
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,862
What's the story with
this Proudfoot girl?

586
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:07,325
She's a mambo priestess, like her mom.
Has been since she was 13.

587
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,578
When's the last time you saw Johnny
Favorite at one of those chicken stuffings?

588
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,596
He used to run around with
Mom Mambo, didn't he?

589
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,849
I told you, I ain't seen
him since before the war.

590
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,544
What about the chicken
foot in the john, huh?

591
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,840
- Means I got a big mouth.
- Not big enough, Toots.

592
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,469
What's this fuckin' star you wear in
your mouth? I'll tell you what.

593
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:31,140
I'm gonna give you my hotel
number, and you give me a call..

594
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,601
in case you hear anything.

595
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,647
You never know, the
next time you get..

596
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,275
a special delivery chicken foot,
you may need a little help.

597
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,237
I'll tell you, as far
as I'm concerned..

598
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,447
any dead chicken's a
good chicken to me.

599
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:37,058
Hey, only cops and bad
news don't knock.

600
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,185
Only private dicks
sleep so late.

601
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,312
That's quite a dream
you were having.

602
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,230
I was on my way to
Mandalay again.

603
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,571
Shit. That's some leak
you got up there.

604
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,283
Here. This your name?

605
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,504
- Yeah.
- That your hotel?

606
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,092
- You're standin' in it, ain't you?
- Your handwritin'?

607
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,970
I think so.

608
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,755
Then perhaps you'd
like to tell us why..

609
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,426
we found that in the hand
of a dead guitar player?

610
01:06:24,688 --> 01:06:28,526
- Toots Sweet is dead?
- Yeah. Toots Sweet.

611
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,445
Only this one weren't so quick.
This one took time.

612
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,031
How did he die?

613
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:37,993
Technically, asphyxiation
by his own genitalia.

614
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,746
But not so technically.

615
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,417
Somebody cut his dick off, stuffed it
in his mouth and choked him to death.

616
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,545
Took to redecoratin' his apartment
with the poorjerk's blood.

617
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:50,256
So, when'd you see him, Angel?

618
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:54,009
- I interviewed him yesterday around 1:00.
- In connection with what?

619
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,636
Missing person.

620
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,348
Who?

621
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:03,185
Some cat took a walk 12 years ago. I saw
Toots in an old photograph with him.

622
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,438
What's the name of this
party you're lookin' for?

623
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,565
Sorry, friend. Can't say.
That's right of privacy.

624
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:10,317
- I'm workin' for a New York lawyer.
- Name?

625
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,820
Oh, come on, man.

626
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:16,365
Winesap. You want his number,
you want his address?

627
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,243
Ask Tess Trueheart over there. It's
in the book he's flickin' through.

628
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,662
It's under "W," genius.

629
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:23,998
You know Ted Williams,
the baseball player?

630
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,167
Yeah.

631
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,628
Herman Winesap.

632
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:34,175
All right, is that it, guys?

633
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,344
That's it.

634
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,390
You and your "right to
privacy" can go eat lunch.

635
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,933
But don't stroll too far, Angel.

636
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,853
Not till we talk to
this lawyer of yours.

637
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,322
You ever watch the
Mickey Mouse Club?

638
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,452
'Cause you know what today is?

639
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:06,707
Today is Wednesday. It's
"anything can happen" day.

640
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,133
Hey, man, you want a tune?

641
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:42,761
Yeah, I got a tune for you.

642
01:14:10,153 --> 01:14:12,281
Hiya, boys.

643
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,659
Oh, yeah, same to you.

644
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:18,770
Hey, I'm gettin' kind of hungry. You
wanna sell some of those things?

645
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,081
Hey, Pop.

646
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,881
- Ten cents a sack.
- Sure, man, give me a sack.

647
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,097
Oh, shit! Get..

648
01:14:54,197 --> 01:14:56,033
You listen good, mister.

649
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:58,827
Margaret Krusemark's old man wants
you on that first train home.

650
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,371
Get that fuckin'
thing away from me!

651
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,875
If you don't, my dog here's gonna
bite your fuckin' face clean off.

652
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,084
Fuck!

653
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:33,487
What happened to you?

654
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,614
A dog bit me.

655
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,824
Yeah, so? What do you want?

656
01:15:39,242 --> 01:15:41,703
Right now, I need a laundry.

657
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,041
- Listen, Epithany.
- Epiphany.

658
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:49,586
Epiphany. I got something
on my mind I wanna ask you.

659
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,422
Yeah. The other night I
saw you and Toots Sweet..

660
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:56,176
boogyin' with the cock-a-doodle-doo
out in the woods.

661
01:15:56,259 --> 01:15:58,470
Looked like you all
were havin' some party.

662
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:00,806
Yeah, so what's your problem?
It's a free country.

663
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,308
Not for chickens it ain't.

664
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,769
Oh, yeah, you got a thing about chickens.
I remember.

665
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:09,773
Listen, Epiphany, Toots
is..Toots is dead.

666
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:11,775
I know. I heard.

667
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:14,027
- And you set him up.
- No, I didn't.

668
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,613
You were the only one that
knew I was seein' Toots.

669
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,782
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

670
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:21,868
You're the one that sent the gift-wrapped
chicken for two, aren't you?

671
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,329
Yeah, well, Toots
had a big mouth.

672
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,374
I guess he did, judgin' by
what the cops found in it.

673
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,626
Quite a cute religion you got.

674
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,879
Nailing a man to a cross
ain't so cute, either.

675
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,465
Yeah, I know. You got to kill
a chicken to make the soup.

676
01:16:35,648 --> 01:16:40,453
We don't go around murdering people,
all right? What about Johnny Favorite?

677
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,182
So now you remember
him after all, huh?

678
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,934
Yeah, he was my father.

679
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,273
Mince?

680
01:16:52,299 --> 01:16:54,100
Mince, I'm gonna pick the
baby up later, okay?

681
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:55,560
He's gonna be all right.

682
01:16:55,644 --> 01:17:00,732
Hey, look, if you got anything you're
holding out, now's a good time to tell.

683
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:03,068
Nothing to tell.

684
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:06,738
Johnny never came
back from the war.

685
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:10,450
Mama waited. Mama died.
It's sad and simple.

686
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:14,746
Epiphany, there's too many
dead bodies floatin' around..

687
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:16,873
even for Louisiana.

688
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:19,125
I'd tell your old man
to look out for you.

689
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:23,221
- You do have a husband.
- No. No husband.

690
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:28,018
Jesus, you got beautiful
eyes, Epiphany.

691
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,896
You really do. They're
truly beautiful.

692
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:35,400
They're the kind of eyes you can
tell just what's goin' on inside.

693
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,278
- Right now you're scared.
- I manage.

694
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:44,409
- Hey, well, listen..
- Yeah. I'll call you if I hear anything.

695
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,954
Hey.

696
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,122
Call me ifyou don't.

697
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,376
All right?

698
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,651
I have a message for you.

699
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,826
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

700
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:25,927
I'm so glad you could come.

701
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,722
Yeah. I didn't know you
were comin' to town.

702
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,873
I have a speaking
engagement in Baton Rouge..

703
01:19:30,957 --> 01:19:34,185
and I thought it would be opportune
to catch up with your progress.

704
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,404
I'm tellin' ya..

705
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,681
Progress ain't too good.

706
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:41,434
I found out a lot of stuff.

707
01:19:41,518 --> 01:19:45,230
But so far, no Johnny Favorite.

708
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,081
How unfortunate.

709
01:19:47,165 --> 01:19:48,875
All I got is a bellyful
of hocus-pocus..

710
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:52,045
and three stiffs.

711
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:54,188
- Stiffs?
- Yeah.

712
01:19:54,272 --> 01:19:57,417
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
Murders.

713
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,711
- Murders.
- Yeah.

714
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:06,218
I got Fowler..Johnny's
doctor bumped himself off.

715
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:09,780
I got this old voodoo
guy, Toots Sweet.

716
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:14,851
He got choked to death with a part
of the body meant for pissing with.

717
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,853
This is a church, Mr. Angel.

718
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,440
I'll tell you something.
I know it's a church..

719
01:20:20,523 --> 01:20:23,134
but there's a lot of religion
going around with this thing.

720
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:26,439
It's very weird, and I don't
understand it. It's ugly.

721
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:29,199
They say there's just enough
religion in the world..

722
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:32,377
to make men hate one another, but
not enough to make them love.

723
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,079
Oh, is that what they say?

724
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,998
I'll tell you something,
Mr. Cyphre, there..

725
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,668
wasn't too much love around
for Johnny Favorite.

726
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:43,964
All right, that guy was bad luck and
it's starting to rub off on me.

727
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,675
I'm a murder suspect
already in two cases.

728
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:50,762
The police found my name and my
address in Toots Sweet's hand.

729
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:53,598
I know. Winesap told me.

730
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,308
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.

731
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,979
And a third? You said
there were three murders.

732
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:03,858
I checked out Johnny's old society
girlfriend.. Margaret Krusemark.

733
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:07,320
- Do you know her?
- Vaguely.

734
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:12,075
Vaguely? Let me tell you, I'm a
little fed up with fuckin' "vaguely."

735
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,578
"Vaguely" is puttin' a noose around
my neck, and I'm startin' to choke.

736
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:18,748
So, Mr. Cyphre, did
you know her or not?

737
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:22,335
I knew about her, but I
never actually knew her.

738
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,129
All right. I'll tell you what.

739
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:29,009
She was doin' my chart. I gave her
Johnny's birth date.. February 14..

740
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:35,098
Except someone got to her and took
out their own Valentine's card.

741
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:38,893
They split her open and
they cut out her heart.

742
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:44,482
I guess she couldn't predict
the future for herself.

743
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,277
The future isn't what it
used to be, Mr. Angel.

744
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,779
- And your conclusions?
- I haven't any.

745
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:53,700
All I know is Johnny's runnin' around
bumpin' off everyone he used to know.

746
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:57,329
And more and more it's me
who's on the line for it.

747
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,832
I'm bein' set up, and it's scarin'
the shit out of me, all right?

748
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:04,878
So why don't you just tell me and level
with me what the fuck is goin' on here?

749
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:10,467
Just Johnny Favorite and the debt
that's owed to me, Mr. Angel.

750
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:13,094
I have old-fashioned
ideas about honor.

751
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,848
You know, an eye for an
eye, things like that.

752
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:20,268
Who the fuck are you, Cyphre?

753
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,020
Watch your language.

754
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:26,566
Hey, I don't give a fuck
if this is a church, okay?

755
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:29,027
Churches give me the creeps.
I don't like churches.

756
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:32,322
- Are you an atheist?
- Yes, I am.

757
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,741
I'm from Brooklyn.

758
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,794
I'll be in town
for a day or two.

759
01:22:37,878 --> 01:22:40,004
Let me know what else you
find, and if you need money..

760
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,599
No, no, the money's fine.

761
01:22:42,682 --> 01:22:45,894
But if I ain't careful, that
5,000 bucks you gave me..

762
01:22:45,977 --> 01:22:49,022
could just buy me a seat
on the electric chair.

763
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,919
Hi.

764
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:30,130
Frightened eyes never lie.

765
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,633
Come on. Come on inside.

766
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,309
- Where's your child?
- He's with Mincy.

767
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:44,686
She's bringing him over later.

768
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:48,481
She's got 14 of her own,
so he'll be okay there.

769
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:53,653
Look, Epiphany, you're very welcome
to stay here or I'll get you a room.

770
01:23:53,736 --> 01:23:55,738
No, I'm okay.

771
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:58,867
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna have a drink.
You want a drink?

772
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:03,663
You're gonna have one anyway.

773
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,586
- I've been thinkin', Epiphany.
- Yeah?

774
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:14,424
I was wondering what the hell your mama
ever saw in a guy like Johnny Favorite?

775
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:17,844
I don't know. Whatever he had,
he sure stole her heart away.

776
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,599
To tell you the truth,
the guy was a creep.

777
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:24,726
She sure missed him.

778
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:27,437
I mean, I'll tell ya.

779
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,274
What does a lady see in a guy that runs
around choppin' up pigeons, you know?

780
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:32,984
You know what they say.

781
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:36,529
It's always the badass that makes
a girl's heart beat faster.

782
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:41,743
Did she ever say
anything about him?

783
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,995
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

784
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:46,873
- Just two things.
- Yeah, like what?

785
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:52,295
She once said that Johnny Favorite
was as close to true evil..

786
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:53,880
as she ever wanted to come.

787
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,760
- What else did she say?
- He was a terrific lover.

788
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:05,600
How old are you, Epiphany?

789
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,436
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

790
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:12,357
That's kind ofyoung to
have a kid, isn't it?

791
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,109
It's old enough.

792
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,405
- So, where'd the father go?
- I never knew him.

793
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,452
I'm sorry. To tell
you the truth..

794
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:28,039
I don't know why I
took this room.

795
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,795
It was at Bamboucher.

796
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:36,297
When the spirits possess
you, it's called chevalier.

797
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,926
Oh, yes, I'm familiar with that..
Chevrolet.

798
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:44,138
- Chevalier.
- That's what I said: Chevrolet.

799
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,140
Mounted by the gods.

800
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,394
- Oh, so the gods got you pregnant?
- Yeah.

801
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,437
I understand that. Sorry.

802
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,940
I'm not. It was the
best fuck I ever had.

803
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,047
Want to dance?

804
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,133
In here?

805
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:22,510
Yeah, here.

806
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,144
I got bit by a dog this mornin'.
I can't move around.

807
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:34,981
You won't feel a thing.

808
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,985
- I'll dance with you.
- Yeah?

809
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:41,070
- Yeah. But you gotta promise.
- What's that?

810
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,072
No chickens.

811
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,326
- Okay.
- Come on.Jump on.

812
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:22,792
I should've
recognized the knock.

813
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:25,711
At least you got reason for
sleepin' late this time.

814
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,130
Down here, Angel, we don't
mix with the jigaboos.

815
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:30,341
The colored folks
keep to themselves.

816
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:32,635
Hey, I ain't from down here.

817
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:35,304
- You cut yourself?
- A dog bit me.

818
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:39,892
Somebody named Margaret Krusemark
figure in this missing persons case?

819
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,688
- No. Why?
- She's dead.

820
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:47,525
That nigger guitar player of
yours, he don't matter a shit.

821
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,528
He was into voodoo. They
86 one another two a week.

822
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:55,199
This Krusemark dame, she comes from a
Louisiana money family..white money.

823
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:58,828
So two people get bumped off in the
same week. What's the connection?

824
01:30:58,911 --> 01:31:01,289
- Similar circumstances.
- Like what?

825
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:03,666
Did she get her
dick cut off too?

826
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:07,670
No. Some fucker cut her heart out,
neat as a butcher on Decatur Street.

827
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:11,090
Look, mine's a missing persons. It's not
a murder, okay? Why you telling me this?

828
01:31:11,173 --> 01:31:13,759
I want to know the name of the
party you're lookin' for.

829
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,178
I already told you. Call New York.
Talk to the lawyer.

830
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:20,933
I did. That fancy mouthpiece, he gave
me the same big-city shit as you.

831
01:31:22,134 --> 01:31:24,895
What do you want me to say? Hey,
you and Effie Klinker over there..

832
01:31:24,978 --> 01:31:27,231
why don't you just fuck
off and leave me alone?

833
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,693
This ain't jigaboo town, ass wipe! You
play jump rope with Louisiana law..

834
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:34,780
and I'm gonna stuff your big-city
smarts right up your New York ass!

835
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:40,036
This Krusemark broad, she was into
stargazing, black magic, all kinds of shit.

836
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:45,333
There ain't nothin' worse for a cop than
people who get killed for nutso reasons.

837
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:50,838
Sorry if I made a mess. Maybe you
can get your nigger to clean it up.

838
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:01,891
Girl of my dreams

839
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:04,727
I I love you

840
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:08,356
Honest I do

841
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:14,153
You are so sweet

842
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:22,870
If I could just hold your charms

843
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:26,916
Again in my arms

844
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:29,418
Life..

845
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:31,963
What's that tune you're singin'?

846
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:35,583
You don't know it? It's
one by Johnny Favorite.

847
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:37,835
My mom used to sing it
to me all the time.

848
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:44,475
- You okay?
- Yeah.

849
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,314
 If I could just

850
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,317
Hold your charms

851
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:57,863
Again in my arms

852
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:02,743
Life would be complete

853
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,635
Shit!

854
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,349
Thanks.

855
01:35:46,365 --> 01:35:48,450
What do you want, Mr. Angel?

856
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,953
I guess you already knew that.

857
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,663
Why should I?

858
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:55,124
A couple of your morons
with a matching poodle..

859
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:57,918
have been chasing my
balls around for days.

860
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:01,714
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.

861
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:05,801
As far as I know, that dance
band scumbag is dead.

862
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:10,097
That dance band scumbag may be the
one that killed your daughter.

863
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:13,142
Who's employing you?

864
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:14,810
I can't say.

865
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,896
I'll pay.

866
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,981
So do they.

867
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:22,026
Twelve years ago you and your
daughter snatched Favorite..

868
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:25,112
out of some nuthatch
up in Poughkeepsie.

869
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:30,201
You paid a junkie doctor 25 grand to
pretend Johnny was still a turniphead.

870
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,536
You did a pretty good
job until a week ago.

871
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:37,124
You used the name Edward Kelly.

872
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,506
Let's walk over here. It's a little
private, and you can sample our gumbo.

873
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:47,009
That's all right. I
got an acid stomach.

874
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:49,762
Besides, Cajun cooking kills me.

875
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:58,229
It's a pity about your stomach.
You'd have enjoyed our gumbo.

876
01:37:17,122 --> 01:37:21,293
I was Edward Kelly. It was me
who paid Fowler the 25 G's.

877
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:25,089
- Did Favorite know you?
- No.

878
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,674
He acted like a sleepwalker.

879
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:29,134
He just stared out the window
and watched the lights go by.

880
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,264
Where were you takin' him?

881
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:36,892
Times Square. It was New Year's Eve,
1943. I just dropped him off..

882
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:41,230
in the crowd and he walked out of our
lives forever, or so we thought.

883
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:45,526
You're tellin' me that you paid 25 grand
for a guy and you lost him in a crowd?

884
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:47,861
I did it for my daughter.

885
01:37:48,045 --> 01:37:50,839
It was some sort of hocus-pocus she
and Johnny were foolin' around with.

886
01:37:50,923 --> 01:37:52,591
- My daughter was obsessed.
- I know.

887
01:37:52,674 --> 01:37:54,551
I found a mummified
hand in her room.

888
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:58,806
The "hand of glory." It was supposed
to be able to open any lock.

889
01:37:58,889 --> 01:38:01,192
It was the right hand of
a convicted murderer..

890
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:03,043
cut off while his neck
was still in the noose.

891
01:38:03,227 --> 01:38:06,355
Or so Margaret believed.

892
01:38:06,438 --> 01:38:09,591
- Black magic.
- Black, white, what difference
does it make?

893
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:11,635
- Margaret was always..
- Evil.

894
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:13,929
Evil is a dunghill, Mr. Angel.

895
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:16,849
Everyone gets on his own and
speaks out about someone else's.

896
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:20,978
Margaret wasn't evil. She
was a strange kid, though.

897
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,397
She was into tarot cards
before she could read.

898
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,816
Who got her started?

899
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:28,235
Some maid, governess..who knows?

900
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:31,739
Some maid, some governess.. Everything
you tell me is a crock of shit!

901
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:36,285
You're the one that got her started!
You're the fuckin' devil worshipper!

902
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:38,620
The prince of darkness
protects the powerful.

903
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:41,749
- That's a crock of shit!
- I can't help it if you don't believe.

904
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:46,420
You come straight with me, you slimebag,
or I'll save this state an execution.

905
01:38:46,503 --> 01:38:49,882
I introduced Johnny Favorite to my
daughter. He was very powerful.

906
01:38:49,965 --> 01:38:52,843
I once watched him conjure up
"Lucifuge" in my living room.

907
01:38:52,926 --> 01:38:54,636
He was in it much
deeper than me.

908
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,931
He made a pact with Satan.
He sold his soul.

909
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,667
You expect me to swallow that?

910
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,618
Swallow it. Spit it out.
I don't give a damn.

911
01:39:01,701 --> 01:39:05,272
That's a crock of shit, you
lying, old, fucking motherfucker!

912
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:08,525
- He sold his soul for stardom.
- For stardom? Are you..

913
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:12,279
- That's a crock of shit!
- Satan rose from the depth.

914
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:15,532
It was magnificent, except he thought
he could outwit the prince of darkness.

915
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:19,244
Johnny sold his soul. Then when he made
it big, he tried to duck out of it.

916
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,205
That's a crock of shit!

917
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:24,166
Johnny came across an obscure
rite in an ancient manuscript.

918
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:27,419
- He needed a victim his own age.
- Why?

919
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:31,840
To steal their soul. So Toots and
Johnny picked up a young soldier.

920
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:32,758
Who?

921
01:39:32,841 --> 01:39:35,761
Just a soldier celebrating New
Year's Eve in Times Square.

922
01:39:35,844 --> 01:39:38,472
- Who was this soldier?
- They took him back to Johnny's hotel.

923
01:39:38,555 --> 01:39:41,934
- That's where the ceremony took place.
- What ceremony?

924
01:39:42,017 --> 01:39:44,436
The boy was bound naked
on a rubber mat.

925
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,648
There were complicated incantations
and stuff in Latin and Greek.

926
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:50,150
A pentacle was branded
on his chest.

927
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:54,071
Margaret handed Johnny a virgin dagger
and he sliced the boy clean open.

928
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:56,657
And he ate his heart.

929
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:59,952
He cut it out so quickly the heart was
still beating when he wolfed it down.

930
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:04,081
Johnny's plan was to drop out
and resurface as the soldier.

931
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:06,917
But before he could work
things out, he was drafted.

932
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,045
Then Johnny was injured, sent home
without even knowing who he was.

933
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,756
Who was that boy?

934
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:18,137
Only Johnny knew. He sealed the dog
tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret.

935
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,848
It was Margaret's plan to
drop him off in Times Square.

936
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,852
That would be the last place that
he'd remember before it happened.

937
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:30,983
He needed a victim..
someone his own age..

938
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:37,406
to steal their soul.

939
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:42,035
And he sliced the boy clean
open and he ate his heart.

940
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:45,414
Who was the boy?

941
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:50,002
Johnny's plan was to drop out
and resurface as the soldier.

942
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:52,087
Or maybe he gained possession
of the guy's soul.

943
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,839
He still looked
Iike Johnny to me.

944
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:05,517
Oh, shit!

945
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:19,943
I know who I am!
I know who I am!

946
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:43,008
Alas.

947
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:47,721
How terrible is wisdom when it brings
no profit to the wise, Johnny.

948
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:51,516
Louis Cyphre.

949
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,603
Lucifer.

950
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:59,441
Even your name is a
dime-store joke.

951
01:43:59,524 --> 01:44:03,695
Mephistopheles is such a
mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.

952
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:06,990
You think posing as the devil..

953
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:10,869
just 'cause it scared some
superstitious old guitar player..

954
01:44:10,952 --> 01:44:14,665
and that witch and
that nutty old man..

955
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:16,917
You think it's gonna scare me?

956
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,462
It ain't, 'cause
I know who I am.

957
01:44:20,545 --> 01:44:24,508
And you killed them, and
you're tryin' to pin it on me.

958
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:27,761
And I know who I am.

959
01:44:27,844 --> 01:44:31,431
If I had cloven hoofs and a pointed
tail, would you be more convinced?

960
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,519
You're crazy.

961
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:38,939
I know who I am. You're
trying to frame me.

962
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:42,359
You're trying to frame me.
Cyphre, I know who I am.

963
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:45,362
You murdered them people.
I never killed nobody.

964
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:48,740
I didn't kill Fowler..

965
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,742
and..

966
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:53,120
and I didn't kill Toots..

967
01:44:53,203 --> 01:44:56,498
and I didn't kill Margaret
and I didn't kill Krusemark.

968
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:59,126
I didn't kill no one.

969
01:44:59,209 --> 01:45:02,546
- I'm afraid you did, Johnny.
- My name's not Johnny.

970
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:04,756
All killed by your own hand.

971
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,509
Guided by me, naturally.

972
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:11,138
Frankly, you were doomed from the
moment you slit that young boy in half.

973
01:45:11,221 --> 01:45:13,515
And Johnny..

974
01:45:13,598 --> 01:45:18,145
for 12 years you've been living on
borrowed time & another man's memories.

975
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,401
Hey, I'm gonna tell
Winesap, 'cause he knows.

976
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,319
Winesap? He's dead.

977
01:45:27,946 --> 01:45:29,072
Nasty accident.

978
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:35,162
Don't worry. No one will mourn
one less lawyer in the world.

979
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:38,498
There's death everywhere
these days, Johnny.

980
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:43,086
But what gives human
life its worth anyway?

981
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:46,798
Because someone loves
it or hates it?

982
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:50,969
The flesh is weak, Johnny.
Only the soul is immortal.

983
01:45:56,558 --> 01:45:59,186
And yours belongs to me.

984
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:05,942
I know who I am.

985
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:13,283
That's it, Johnny.
Take a good look.

986
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:16,495
However cleverly you
sneak up on a mirror..

987
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:19,498
your reflection always looks
you straight in the eye.

988
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:22,000
I know who I am!

989
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:54,699
I know who I am!

990
01:48:06,938 --> 01:48:08,565
Why'd you come back?

991
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:20,785
I live here.

992
01:48:22,537 --> 01:48:24,623
Who is she?

993
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:29,753
She ain't "Angel, Harold."

994
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,716
She's my daughter.

995
01:48:34,799 --> 01:48:37,510
Bullshit. Who is she?

996
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:42,349
She's Epiphany Proudfoot.

997
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:44,976
She stayed here for
a little while.

998
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:49,814
Long enough for you
to kill her, right?

999
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:52,108
Unless that ain't your
gun up her snatch.

1000
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:11,628
You're gonna burn
for this, Angel.

1001
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:16,841
I know.

1002
01:49:18,635 --> 01:49:20,553
In hell.

1003
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:32,550
<font face="Eras Demi ITC">
{\an5}SubText:

1004
01:52:50,054 --> 01:52:51,973
Harry.

1005
01:52:52,056 --> 01:52:54,017
Johnny.
