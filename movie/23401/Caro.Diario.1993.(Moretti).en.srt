00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,889
- CHAPTER I: ON MY VESPA -

2
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,689
- DEAR DIARY, -

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,248
- THERE'S ONE THING -

4
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,122
- I LIKE THE MOST -

5
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,928
Summer in Rome
cinemas are closed.

6
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,201
All you can see is
"Sex, Love and Shepherding",

7
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,807
"Bestial Desires",
"Snow White and the 7 Blacks",

8
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,924
or horror films like
"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer",

9
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,441
or some Italian films...

10
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,330
I'm afraid to rethink my life.

11
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,044
I'm a coward.

12
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,284
What happened? Tell me.

13
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,925
I don't know any more.

14
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,606
Your temples are turning white.

15
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,165
The weight of defeat.

16
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,408
A series of defeats.

17
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,285
What has our generation become?

18
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,090
Publicists, architects...

19
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,562
brokers,
congressmen, journalists.

20
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,084
We all changed for the worse.

21
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,084
Sold out, compromised, co-opted.

22
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,444
Why "all"?
This fixation with us "all,"

23
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,608
"being sold out and co-opted"!

24
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,291
When did we last take a walk?

25
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,323
We stay together out of habit.

26
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,010
You're ashamed of me.

27
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,210
What a headache!
Even Optalidon are different now.

28
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,406
Remember the rattle of pills
in the old tube?

29
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,571
Everything has really changed.

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,367
Know what, Antonio?
You have worsened.

31
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,847
You have no real feelings.

32
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,487
We're old, bitter, dishonest.

33
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,008
We used to shout
awful, violent slogans.

34
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,886
Look how ugly we've gotten!

35
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,687
You shouted awful,
violent slogans.

36
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,649
You've gotten ugly.

37
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,250
I shouted the right slogans
and I'm a splendid 40-year old!

38
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,962
What I like the most is
to see houses, neighborhoods.

39
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,846
My favorite neighborhood
is the Garbatella.

40
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,849
I stroll through
the old housing project.

41
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,408
I don't like to see
only the facades.

42
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,081
I like to see the inside too.

43
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,607
I ring the buzzer

44
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,489
and pretend
I'm location scouting... for a film.

45
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,770
The tenant asks me
what the film is about.

46
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,245
I don't know what to say...

47
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,608
It's a film about
a Trotskyst pastry chef

48
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,007
in Italy during the 1950s.
A musical.

49
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,371
Not bad, a musical comedy
about a Trotskyst pastry chef

50
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,691
in the conformist Italy of the '50s!

51
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,046
On my Vespa,

52
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,291
I enjoy looking at penthouses
where I'd like to live.

53
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,371
I see myself renovating
those penthouses,

54
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,011
whose owners...
have no intention of selling.

55
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,569
One day, a penthouse
which seemed more affordable

56
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,088
Silvia and I
went up to take a look.

57
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,484
We asked the price.

58
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,082
"$700 a square foot."

59
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,964
$700 a square foot?!

60
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,050
"You can't talk square feet",

61
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,846
"via Dandolo is a historic street,"

62
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,440
"Garibaldi fought here."

63
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,131
I may be nuts,

64
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,083
but I love this bridge.

65
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,562
I need to cross it twice a day.

66
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,683
You know what I was thinking?
A very sad thing:

67
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,691
even in a more decent society
than this one,

68
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,721
I'll only feel at ease
with a minority of people.

69
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,051
Not like in those films
where a couple

70
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,004
fights on a desert island

71
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,043
because the filmmaker
doesn't believe in people.

72
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,085
I believe in people. I just don't
believe in the majority of people.

73
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,602
I'll always be in tune
with a minority.

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,051
Good luck!

75
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,487
My secret dream
has always been to dance well.

76
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,369
"Flashdance" was the film...

77
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,844
that changed my life.

78
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,683
It was a film about dancing,
about knowing how to dance.

79
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,451
But in the end I just watch.

80
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,088
Which is fine,
but it's something else altogether.

81
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,800
You know what my dream is?

82
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,960
To know how to dance.

83
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,890
I was never the same

84
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,925
after I saw "Flashdance",
with Jennifer Beals.

85
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,727
Is that dancer Jennifer Beals?

86
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,922
Howl envy them!
Is she Jennifer Beals?

87
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,802
Spinaceto,
a recent housing development.

88
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,570
Bad-mouthed by everyone.

89
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,162
"This sure isn't Spinaceto!"

90
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,563
"You live in Spinaceto
or something?"

91
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,961
I remember reading a story

92
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,246
called
"Escape from Spinaceto",

93
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,849
about a kid who got out of there

94
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,849
and never went back.

95
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,606
So, let's go see Spinaceto.

96
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,968
Spinaceto! I expected worse.
It's not bad!

97
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,924
I was just thinking that.

98
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,722
Casalpalocco.
Driving by these homes,

99
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,251
I smell jogging suits,

100
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,126
video tapes,
watch dogs in the garden,

101
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,722
pizzas in cardboard boxes.

102
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,128
Why did they come here
30 years ago?

103
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,846
Why did you move to Casalpalocco?

104
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,611
- This green, this peace...
- Yeah, green...

105
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,486
- You moved here around 1961...
- '62.

106
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,167
- 30 years ago, Rome...
- Was a marvelous city!

107
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,770
It's different here.

108
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,929
But Rome was beautiful then!

109
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,645
That's what frightens me.

110
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,330
Watch dogs, videos, slippers.

111
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,120
Jennifer Beals?

112
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,044
- Yes?
- From "Flashdance"?

113
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,242
- What'd he say?
- "Who are you."

114
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,843
I'd always liked to know
how to dance.

115
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,329
If I lived in Emilia Romagna,

116
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,804
there are old people's homes,
hospitals that work,

117
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,161
dance schools,

118
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,647
tango, merengue...

119
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,403
When I hear music,
I could dance instead of watch.

120
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,560
Those shoes
are very comfortable!

121
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,085
So simple, yet...
They must feel good on your feet.

122
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,882
Yes, very comfortable.

123
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,809
What'd say? "Crazy"?

124
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,121
Wasn't it "crazy"?

125
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,521
What does that mean?

126
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,170
Special, peculiar,
almost crazy, but not quite.

127
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,091
Dumb, almost dumb.

128
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,685
Even in other cities

129
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,044
I only like to look at houses.

130
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,202
What would be great is a film just
of houses. Panning shots of houses.

131
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,002
Garbatella, 1927.

132
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,248
Olympic Village, 1960.

133
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,965
Tufello, 1960.

134
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,611
Vigne Nuove, 1987.

135
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,523
Monteverde, 1939.

136
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,686
- "HENRY: PORTRAIT
OF A SERIAL KILLER" -

137
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,525
Hey. Am I stuttering?
Fork over the $50 and go to hell.

138
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,246
Here's your 50 bucks.

139
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,683
Need a hand?

140
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,170
Otis, do you need a hand
or can you do it by yourself?

141
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,048
I wander around the city for hours

142
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,007
trying to remember
who said good things about this film.

143
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,930
I read a review,

144
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,408
I read something positive
about "Henry"...

145
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,290
Suddenly I remember
I find the review

146
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,326
and copy it in my diary.
Here it is:

147
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,570
"Henry kills people,
but he's a kind of good guy,"

148
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,571
"Only facts count for him."

149
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,166
"Otis is the real scum."

150
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,763
"Henry has a mad solidarity
with his victims,"

151
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,281
"a prince of annihilation,"

152
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,767
"promising a merciful death."

153
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,809
"The director awakens the public"

154
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,124
"to its worst nightmare:
a shower of gore,"

155
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,926
"impaled eyes,
martyred flesh: abomination."

156
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,250
"Henry: the first to dismember"

157
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,967
"the criminal philosophy
of the Hollywood racists."

158
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,685
I wonder if whoever wrote this,

159
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:46,042
before falling asleep,
has a moment of remorse.

160
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,163
- When did this begin? When
did all this begin? - I don't know.

161
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,044
Maybe when you wrote:

162
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,164

182
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,771
I don't know why,
but I'd never been

183
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,247
where Pasolini was murdered.

184

- CHAPTER II: ISLANDS -

185
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,522
The boat arrives in Lipari.

186
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,129
I'm visiting a friend
who moved here 11 years ago.

187
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,722
Ever since, he's been studying
Joyce's "Ulysses".

188
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,931
I'm beginning to write my film.

189
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,046
I've brought press clippings
that I'll need for my work,

190
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,371
which I've been saving for years.

191
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,001
I know that I'll work in Lipari.

192
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,690
An orange juice, please,

193
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,961
and a sandwich

194
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,561
mozzarella...

195
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,287
If everybody went on foot,
there'd be less accidents.

196
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,965
A sandwich...

197
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,370
Tomato and mozzarella.
Thanks.

198
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,087
- What were you watching?
- When?

199
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,046
Inside, on television.

200
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,369
It's not TV,
it was a strange film:

201
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,605
Silvana Mangano was a nun.
Then she dances in the middle...

202
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,882
- It must happen to you too.
- Never!

203
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,568
- You never watch TV?
- Never?

204
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,446
I haven't watched TV
for 30 years.

205
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,408
You know what
Hans Magnus Enzensberger says?

206
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,290
I agree with him.

207
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,007
It's the first time

208
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,124
in all my years here
that's there's such confusion.

209
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,080
- Believe me?
- Yes.

210
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,645
You clip funny news items?

211
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:25,803
For years, I've accumulated
dumb information, stupid articles.

212
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,764
Evidently I'm attracted...

213
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,602
by these things.

214
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,446
Too much noise,
too much confusion...

215
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,971
We decide to leave for Salina,
a quieter island, more domestic.

216
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,124
Gerardo has friends there.
They have children.

217
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,966
No, "one" child.
In Salina... everyone has one child.

218
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,241
We'll be calm there.
Manage to get something done.

219
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,322
You're not being very polite

220
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,570
considering I've come
to bring your wedding present.

221
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,091
Look who's there!

222
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,243
You won't close the casino down!

223
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,204
- Why all this hatred?
- I'll tell you why:

224
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,368
I hate people like you.

225
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,046
You give others false hope,

226
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,561
then toss them in the mud.

227
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,527
Go home, try to calm down.

228
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,247
Take my word: your cathedral
will never see the light of day.

229
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,561
You came back.

230
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,969
I have something to tell you.

231
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,970
Hope it's good news.

232
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,529
I'm not sure we can trust her,
but I saw Gina today.

233
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,531
Gina says Kit wants
to get back at you, at all costs.

234
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,323
That's nothing new.

235
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,324
He told me himself, way back!

236
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,282
I can't believe that for Pietro

237
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,370
these first years will mean nothing.

238
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,524
He'll never know.

239
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,845
He'll never remember this period
of intimacy and closeness,

240
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,610
when he needed me so much.

241
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,963
Something big has just happened:

242
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,805
he toilet trained himself.

243
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,491
We were both going to take
2 weeks off work

244
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,329
to do it.

245
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,281
But he did it alone!

246
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,928
He has made no mistakes.
He began to behave like an adult.

247
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,963
And the first day of school?

248
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,769
We were up all night,
We were worried, angst-ridden.

249
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,248
First day angst.

250
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,648
Pietro just slept.

251
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,211
He didn't know his life
would change the next day.

252
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,481
Is he asleep?

253
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,525
He's going through
a complicated but transitory phase.

254
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,165
Going from a family regime

255
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,924
to a school regime, where he...

256
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,567
He's asleep, the volume is okay.

257
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,169
Sees lots of children,
lots of people.

258
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,761
Daniele!

259
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,324
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

260
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,647
I watched TV last night.

261
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,844
- A good program.
- "Italy's most wanted". - Very good!

262
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,802
But I didn't get it all...

263
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,524
In that family...

264
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,051
- They upset you?
- A little.

265
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,084
They go too far with Pietro.

266
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,609
We have a different relationship
with Daniele.

267
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,083
We want another child,

268
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,722
but we're afraid of his reaction.

269
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,167
And we often ask him.

270
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,205
Every 2 or 3 years we ask:
"Want a little brother?"

271
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,169
He gets pissed off.

272
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,611
I'm afraid.

273
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,766
We're afraid.

274
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,447
How are you?

275
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:37,170
Sara, it's Lorenzo,
Daniele's Dad. Remember?

276
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,926
Put Dad on, please.

277
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,089
How does the cat go?

278
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,289
And the grasshopper?

279
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,886
The grasshopper goes "cri-cri".

280
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,043
Now put on Dad, please.

281
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,730
And the lamb?

282
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,888
The lamb goes "baaaa".

283
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,522
The rooster goes
"cock-a-doodle-doo".

284
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,085
How does...

285
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,806
Sara, please, put Dad on.

286
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,528
The donkey goes "hee-haw".

287
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,322
I don't know all of them.

288
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:23,285
For years now, Salina was dominated
by only children. Each family...

289
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,121
The chick goes "peep-peep".

290
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,281
Each family has one child,
only one,

291
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,606
to whom was entrusted
the command of the situation.

292
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,640
It was impossible
to communicate by phone.

293
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,444
In the homes,

294
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,249
children intercepted all calls...

295
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,281
It's Rosanna.
Dad or Mom there?

296
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,602
Here's Dad. Bye.

297
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,924
Leandro, who am I?

298
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,327
Hello, who's there?
I'm Paolo.

299
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,603
What's your name?
What's my name?

300
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,881
It's Franco.

301
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,240
And the little pig?

302
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,487
And the hippopotamus?

303
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,965
I don't know the giraffe!

304
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,241
The little pig.

305
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,091
I don't know the swallow!

306
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,728
Who's home, Mom or Dad?

307
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,006
Mom and Dad are here,
but I'm gonna tell you a story.

308
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,081
Here goes...

309
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,921
Un-der-stand what I', say-ing?

310
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,728
- Fine, go ahead. - Understand
when I talk? - Put Mom on...

311
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,801
Il maialino.

312
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,760
Wake up!

313
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,089
No! The light!

314
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,966
Daniele's awake, he's waiting.

315
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,084
In 15 minutes
it's the worst time of day.

316
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,123
- Why?
- It's almost 3:00 A.M.

317
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,130
- The hour of the wolf.
- The hour of the wolf!

318
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,447
The hour when we're the loneliest.

319
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,325
Every 3:00 A.M., for 12 years,

320
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,762
Daniele gets in bed with us.
You coming?

321
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,810
- May we?
- Come in.

322
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,242
- How is it going tonight? Are you scared?
- No.

323
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,169
There's lots of us
to keep you company.

324
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,084
Under the cover covers!

325
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,449
- Sure you're not scared?
- Yes, yes!

326
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,650
- He's never had a baby-sitter.
- Why not?

327
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,129
- We've always stayed with him.
- Always!

328
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,766
- You've never gone out?
- Never.

329
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,771
So we've read everything:
Hegel.

330
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,211
Spinoza...

331
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,766
We read Federico Tozzi...

332
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,928
- We read all of Xenophon,
- Svevo.

333
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,407
- Herodotus...
- Then...

334
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,966
Tacitus.

335
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,406
All of Tacitus!

336
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,090
All of it!

337
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,090
Saint Augustine...

338
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,202
- Delfini, Meneghello e Capitini.
- Cicero, read and re-read.

339
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,606
And Rousseau...

340
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,966
- And Leibnitz...
- Wittgenstein.

341
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,768
Dear Diary,
we sail by the island of Panarea.

342
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,368
Gerardo says he's never been,

343
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:13,001
but points out the nights spots,
the discos, the restaurants, the pubs.

344
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,406
We decide
non to stop in Panarea.

345
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,725
We sail towards Stromboli,

346
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,448
where we're sure
we'll finally manage to...

347
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,847
Some lines of Tibullus
came to mind

348
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,647
that describe how we are

349
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,762
in front of the TV.

350
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,925
"Quam juvat": how beautiful...

351
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,366
When we're slumped on a couch:
"Cubantem".

352
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,408
To hear the impetuous winds: "Immites
ventos", battling amongst themselves.

353
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,845
I remember them
thanks to a variety show.

354
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,049
Give it to me!

355
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,966
The list of what you were supposed
to make me do!

356
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,808
I must never waste time!

357
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,604
Everyone told me:

358
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,604
on arriving in Stromboli you feel
"the menacing presence of the volcano".

359
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,722
Gerardo and I have a fight.

360
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,050
He didn't remind me
I was here to work.

361
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,448
I had given him my "to do" list

362
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,407
but all I've done is waste my time.

363
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,407
I'm the Mayor!
Glad to meet you, Professor.

364
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,249
Please, be our guests.

365
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,204
No, we'd prefer a hotel,
we have to concentrate.

366
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,121
A friend has a perfect place.
Come!

367
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,688
We're expecting a Japanese agronomist
responsible for the 110,000 acres

368
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,649
around Tokyo.

369
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,363
He wants to talk
about my projects.

370
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,244
Riccardo!

371
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,846
He wants to understand
the secret of our equilibrium.

372
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,805
It's me!

373
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,161
I've given up
the plan for an avenue

374
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,521
with palm trees from L.A.!

375
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,321
I'd like to give this island back
the identity it has lost.

376
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,447
Piazzas, streets, gardens,
fountains, theaters!

377
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,362
- They have no place to sleep.
- That's enough!

378
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,006
Excuse me.

379
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,843
I have so many projects...
but they all fall through!

380
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,168
Everyone is sot hostile here.

381
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,041
Why are they so hostile?

382
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,361
I need to put these friends up...

383
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,082
The opposite of Amsterdam,
where you walk at night,

384
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,211
as if wandering through
living rooms, bedrooms...

385
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,804
Everything's lit up, visible,
a life... without curtains.

386
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm the Mayor,
you can't treat me like this!

387
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,247
They have to concentrate
three or four days...

388
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,687
They don't cooperate.
It's no use.

389
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,201
Must be the volcano's
menacing presence.

390
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,040
We have the human material:

391
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,808
there's a mixture
between Italians and Germans,

392
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,565
very interesting!

393
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,123
Big families,
not like in Salina with zero growth.

394
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,166
I have 3 children, for example.

395
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,884
All this wasted potential!

396
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,491
What a shame!

397
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,441
- Here you have to continue on foot.
- Up this way?

398
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,201
Go slow and steady.
Sorry,

399
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,365
I'm expecting a call
from the Japanese agronomist

400
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,131
the one responsible
for the 110,000 acres,

401
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,245
Fine, goodbye.
See you tomorrow, thanks.

402
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,688
There's something hypnotic,

403
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,283
an ancient link...
Don't turn around.

404
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,726
Don't turn around!

405
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,207
What's wrong?

406
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,841
A group of Americans,
at the rest area.

407
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,804
Do me a favor, I'm embarrassed.

408
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:51,286
I'd like to know if Sally Spectra told
her husband she was pregnant, or not...

409
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,810
"The bold and the Beautiful".

410
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,686
- They are ahead of us in America.
- Further on with the episodes.

411
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,205
And did Stephanie learn anything

412
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,081
on her ex-husband's ex wife.

413
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,571
Whose wife is Nancy?

414
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,404
Thorne's.

415
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,527
Where did Stephanie plant the mikes?

416
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,768
In the home
of her ex-husband's new wife!

417
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,649
Why?

418
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,161
Because she's jealous!

419
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,164
What was Sally Spectra's problem?

420
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,851
She's pregnant!
Does her husband know or not?

421
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,284
She told him!

422
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,281
In these episodes?

423
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,364
In this phase,

424
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,041
Nancy is madly in love
with her tennis teacher.

425
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,611
There's no hope for Thorne!

426
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,566
I'm so envious
of the music of Panarea.

427
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,571
I'd like to ask Ennio Morricone
to write some music,

428
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,930
a soundtrack for the village.

429
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,850
- Could be an idea.
- Like that western... How does it go?

430
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,081
Exactly.

431
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,204
Good luck with everything.

432
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,970
We may never see
each other again...

433
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,404
The island lit up
by a great photography director.

434
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:11,402
Storaro doing the lighting
and the sunset of Stromboli!

435
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,969
Rebuilding Stromboli from scratch!
Rebuilding Italy,

436
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,440
a new way of life.

437
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,450
New light, new sounds,

438
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,406
a new way of talking,
new colors, new tastes...

439
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,241
All new!

440
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,122
Okay, listen,
we're going to Panarea.

441
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,246
We're going to Panarea.

442
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,404
Welcome! Excuse me...

443
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,445
- Welcome to Panarea. Where
are you coming from? - Stromboli.

444
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,045
What a drag!

445
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,449
I've been preparing a party
in honor of bad taste

446
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,121
for the last year.

447
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,971
Helmut Berger's coming
in his underwear.

448
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,406
Saturday there'll be
my divorce party.

449
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,568
Do you always organize
things like that?

450
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,322
My company does everything:
cocktail parties, trips...

451
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,364
A white elephant
for an exotic dinner,

452
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,687
a special photographer
for a wedding ceremony.

453
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,406
A Watusi to liven up a party.

454
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,047
Ideas, creativity,
atmosphere, networking.

455
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,725
Thanks and goodbye!

456
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,361
Dear Diary,
I'm happy only at sea, sailing,

457
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,087
from the island I've left

458
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,000
to the one I'm going to.

459
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,488
We're sailing towards Alicudi,

460
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,605
the remotest and wildest island.

461
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,002
Bet you're one of these opposed
to "Italy's Most Wanted".

462
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,969
Can we deny Ulysses,
after the fall of Troy,

463
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,208
the right to roam?

464
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,802
To stop at Circe's,
Calypso's, Nausicaa's?

465
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,365
Certainly not.

466
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,245
Otherwise there'd be no Odyssey!

467
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:59,727
But we can't deny
his family's right to look for me.

468
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,689
His son Telemacus wanders
around the Greek Islands

469
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,286
looking for his father.

470
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,084
With a single message,
"Wanted: Ulysses".

471
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,080
Good morning.

472
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,169
Italy can't be saved.

473
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,611
- He's waiting for you.
- Who?

474
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,007
A man who refused success.

475
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,330
Hates narcissism.
Everyone here does.

476
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,882
Alicudi welcomes only those
who think like Alicudi.

477
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,002
Here you'll find energy to work.

478
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,006
Alicudi gives more
than other islands.

479
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,691
I know. I've been told.

480
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,522
- Is it far?
- Yes.

481
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,649
Any other roads?

482
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,043
There are no roads.

483
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,725
There aren't any roads!

484
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,086
Listen, this person...
who is expecting us.

485
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,211
He wrote a successful book.
Too successful.

486
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,760
Too successful!

487
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,326
He came here to atone.

488
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,487
- Alicudi is "the" island.
- I know.

489
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,570
I don't like the other islands.

490
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,570
They are all corrupted.

491
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,925
They don't know how to live alone.

492
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,889
Here everyone lives alone.

493
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,847
Enzensberger...

494
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,481
says television is nothingness.
Fine.

495
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,484
But prove to me
that the soccer match

496
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,444
Honduras-Belgium 3 to 2,
with all its thrills,

497
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,643
was worth nothing.
- Actually...

498
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,282
That nothing seemed a lot to me.
And to you!

499
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,084
Okay, for me too.

500
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,680
- That last minute penalty...
- Yes, but I have a problem to solve.

501
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,041
There are no shutters.

502
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,651
I know...

503
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,286
tomorrow morning
I'll be awake at dawn.

504
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,923
I can only sleep in pitch black.

505
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,011
- Yes, I admit it.
- What?

506
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,770
I've gone a bit overboard
with television.

507
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,484
Yeah, okay...

508
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,764
- But I'm over it now.
- Good.

509
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,322
It's peaceful here, no?

510
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,164
On this island...

511
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,045
You're here?

512
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,484
I never go out
because men are scary.

513
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,728
I can't sleep with light;

514
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,526
there's no shutters.
Do you have any tape?

515
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,648
I want to put together...

516
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,729
I found this cardboard.

517
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,368
I want to live here without roots.
Our roots are too heavy.

518
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,162
All these years
I've been ashamed of Italy.

519
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,767
Ashamed of the other islands:

520
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,647
so greedy, overfed,
ignorant and narcissistic.

521
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,128
Where people
who don't feel guilty live.

522
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,563
We've retired here
to think of others.

523
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:26,401
Italians are one
of the most vulgar people on earth.

524
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,761
This country has
such a desperate need to laugh.

525
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,329
What's there to laugh about?

526
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,482
Can I have the crust?

527
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,764
We've been in Alicudi a few days.

528
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,567
It's really a different island
from the others

529
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,682
and we finally succeed
in concentrating.

530
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,249
Here it's very calm.

531
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,762
Deadly calm.

532
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,764
Are you working?

533
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,527
I'm writing my diary for now, but...

534
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,449
I'm writing to the Pope

535
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,408
because he excommunicated
soap operas.

536
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,128
He says they harm
family togetherness.

537
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,570
Dear Holy Father,

538
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,165
forgive me, but you are wrong,

539
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,762
Our families are
more and more withdrawn.

540
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,248
Thanks to soap operas

541
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,570
we express interest
in other, faraway families

542
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,605
with whom we share
problems, dramas and joys.

543
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,209
"Ines, a Secretary",
10:30 A.M.

544
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,407
"Flamingo Road", 12:50 P.M.

545
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,847
"Falconcrest", 2:00 P.M.

546
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,928
"Maria", 2:25 P.M.

547
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,727
"Santa Barbara",
same time, different channel.

548
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,082
"Celeste", 4:25 P.M.

549
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,491
"The Bold and the Beautiful".

550
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,768
A few days without TV,

551
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,326
but I don't miss it.

552
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,161
- On this island...
- On this island?

553
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,248
There's no electricity.

554
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,481
SQ?

555
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,126
There's no TV here.

556
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,801
Television!

557
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,322
Elevator!

558
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,567
Telephone!

559
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,921
Hot water!

560
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,650
Wait for me!

561
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,804
Television!

562
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,442
How can you live
without TV? Stop!

563
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,809
H. Magnus Enzensberger
stirs my pity

564
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,567
when he says
TV transmits nothingness!

565
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,844
Stop!

566
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,243
Karl Popper, you're mistaken!

567
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,651
TV is not a monster
corrupting children.

568
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:06,326
Children don't become moronic

569
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,487
watching TV, they daydream

570
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,927
as in old times they daydreamed
listening to fables and legends.

571
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,529
- CHAPTER III: DOCTORS -

572
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:56,927
Dear Diary, I've kept the prescriptions
accumulated in a year

573
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,321
and all the notes I took

574
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,525
after every doctor's appointment.

575
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,602
Nothing in this chapter is invented:

576
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,648
prescriptions,

577
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,089
doctors' appointments,

578
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,528
conversations with doctors.

579
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,967
At home after 1:30.
Thanks, bye.

580
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,530
At home after 1:30,
we can...

581
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,044
It's my last session
of chemotherapy,

582
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,447
treatment for cancer.

583
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,008
I've decided to film it.

584
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,202
He can, but inevitably...

585
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,964
Well, that's true, though.

586
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,323
No, that's not true.

587
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,604
Careful with the ear.

588
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,161
- How is it now? Too low?
- No, no, go ahead.

589
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,928
Is it tight enough?

590
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,205
Is it okay?

591
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,885
- Doctor? - Yes?
- Is there Deticene in there?

592
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,563
Better not to know!
Does it sting?

593
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,843
A little.
Let's leave it, but stick around.

594
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,046
One day I started to itch
especially at night.

595
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,011
I called it hives,
but it was nothing of the sort.

596
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,848
I'd heard of a famous
Dermatological Institute in Rome.

597
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,484
People come at dawn,
even form out of the town,

598
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,804
they take a number
and wait their turn.

599
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:17,811
Moretti Giovanni,
born in Brunico 19/8/1953.

600
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,966
- Have you ever been treated for this
before? - No, it's the first time.

601
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,243
- What's wrong with you?
- I have a terrible itch.

602
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,688
- Since when?
- Almost a month.

603
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,929
- Where?
- On my feet and arms.

604
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,691
- When is it worst?
- During the night.

605
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,203
The skin is a little dry...

606
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,203
Let's look here...

607
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,050
I was afraid it was scabies...

608
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,449
No, that's a disease that usually
affects other social classes.

609
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,402
Yes, there's a reaction.

610
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,721
- Have you had hepatitis?
- Yes, a long time ago.

611
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,010
- Other important illnesses?
- No.

612
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,322
- Do you eat?
- What do you mean?

613
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,767
- Do you have an appetite?
- Yes, I do.

614
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,285
You should go somewhere warm,
to the seaside.

615
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,161
Cold dries the skin,

616
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,009
increasing these symptoms.

617
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,124
I'll give you 1 Histamen
before dinner.

618
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,843
1 Flantadin,
in the morning for a week.

619
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,531
A half pill the second week.

620
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,323
I take all the pills

621
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,771
but the itch doesn't go away.

622
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,923
I return to the Institute,

623
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,682
The doctor's not there that day.

624
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,371
Another doctor examines me.

625
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,929
- Your skin's very dry, needs nourishing.
- I know.

626
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,880
Do you have a coin?

627
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,082
A coin?

628
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,682
Watch out for the moles.

629
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,006
Thank you.

630
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,842
Dermatographism,
I think it's a food allergy.

631
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,690
You can get dressed.

632
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,729
Could also be
a nervous problem, stress.

633
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,608
The life we lead,
you lead, Mr Moretti.

634
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:42,962
Here's your colleague's prescription:
Histamen, Fitamid.

635
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,764
- Should I keep taking them?
- No.

636
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,730
Get some lab tests:
blood count, sedimentation rate,

637
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,922
I'll order them...

638
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,967
Now I'll give you Fristamin,
1 a day for a month.

639
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,045
Prazene drops...

640
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,246
Hematocrit 46%,

641
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,409
hemoglobin 16.3,

642
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,208
red cell count...

643
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,326
I do the blood tests,
the results are normal.

644
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,081
But the itching continues,
even increases.

645
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,171
I remember there's
a famous dermatologist in Rome,

646
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,648
a sort of Prince of dermatologists.

647
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,209
I phone the Prince's office.

648
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,402
I'd like an appointment
with the Professor.

649
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,204
Fully booked for three months?

650
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,483
It's urgent,
I have a terrible itch...

651
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,210
Who's the Professor substitute,
his Assistant?

652
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,604
You send him the overflow...

653
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,690
Fine, give me his number.

654
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,923
Thanks, goodbye.

655
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,043
Are you going through
a stressful period?

656
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,006
- Yes, because of the itching.
- Drink a lot of coffee or tea?

657
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,368
A lot of tea.

658
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:20,441
Per day, drink at most
one tea, one coffee or one Coke.

659
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,846
I understand.

660
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,848
These are the medicines
the others gave me.

661
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,691
I know them, good colleagues...

662
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,609
I'll give you something else:

663
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,166
Anfo 3 for the shower.

664
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,485
Idroskin after the shower,

665
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,445
lnfloran,

666
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,051
a pill one day
on an empty stomach.

667
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,970
Atarax,

668
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,001
1 pill in the morning,

669
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,365
1 pill in the afternoon...

670
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,643
I like to take medicines,

671
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,489
and I like to think
they do me good.

672
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,444
But the assistant
was too ill-at-ease.

673
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,284
I couldn't believe him,
even with goodwill.

674
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,164
It was the only time

675
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,928
I didn't go to the pharmacy.

676
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,803
I go back
to the Dermatological Institute.

677
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,565
Not to the dermatology clinic,
but to the allergy clinic.

678
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,005
- These tests...
- Watch out for moles!

679
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,364
Will show you if you're allergic.

680
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,445
First we test the main groups,

681
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:51,566
foods, dust, and pollens,

682
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,200
then identify
the individual substances.

683
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,891
For 1 week I get
30 pricks a day on my back.

684
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:06,131
I'm allergic to milk products,

685
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,763
nuts, fish and pork.

686
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,208
The following days,
they identify specific foods

687
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,087
I'm allergic to and mustn't eat.

688
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,362
I'm allergic to many foods,

689
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,608
and I need a vaccine.

690
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:29,365
These foods are: corn, barley, oats,
garlic, onions, mustard, almonds,

691
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:35,522
beans, soy, peas, parsley,
artichokes, lettuce, tea,

692
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,850
hops, pepper, chestnuts,
salmon, sardines, tuna,

693
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,806
cow milk protein,
cow casein, goat casein,

694
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,925
Swiss cheese,
gorgonzola, Dutch and pork.

695
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,210
The itching continues,

696
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,921
but, through a friend,

697
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:00,489
I finally get to see
the Prince of dermatologists,

698
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,931
just before the holidays.

699
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,801
Colopten 3 times a day.

700
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,971
Cinazyn 20 drops after meals,

701
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,441
Caprolisin one vial at 6:00 P.M.

702
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:20,529
Before going to bed, alternate
Fenistil, Xanax and Atarax.

703
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,610
- One different evenings.
- Alternate. - Fine.

704
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,329
For legs and arms,
these 4 medicines.

705
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,130
For the scalp itch
l'Ecoval Scalp Fluid,

706
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,685
3 drops at night.

707
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:39,968
Remember to wash your hair daily
alternating 3 shampoos I've prescribed.

708
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,567
- Every day?
- Every day-

709
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,883
Moretti, you must help me.

710
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,370
- My family and I are your fans.
- Thank you.

711
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,242
Help me.
Though it's summer and hot,

712
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:59,321
you must always wear
knee-high cotton socks.

713
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,603
- I see you don't wear socks!
- Not in summer.

714
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,008
Knee-high cotton socks

715
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,891
and long-sleeved shirts
even at the beach.

716
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,289
The skin must always be
in contact with cotton.

717
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,484
- I'll jot down my beach house phone.
- Thank you.

718
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,922
When you come back,
you'll be feeling better.

719
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,171
Hope so.
Sorry, I showed up unexpectedly.

720
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,927
Miss, a special price
for Mr Moretti.

721
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,247
Creams too:
Ictyane, Akerat...

722
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,204
And Ictyane, Akerat and Soagen
for the body.

723
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,289
And Fargan cream

724
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,367
and Factan, Apolar
and Mavigen shampoos.

725
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,131
- All three?
- Yes, I have to alternate.

726
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,168
One day I decide to read
the information sheets in the boxes.

727
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,520
Something I never do.

728
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,365
Caprolisin.

729
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,288
Let's see...

730
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,727
Anti-hemorrhagic recommended
for all hemorrhagic syndromes,

731
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,168
internal hemorrhaging.

732
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,288
Caprolisin: out.

733
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,561
Then.

734
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,251
Cinazyn.

735
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,050
Helps circulation,
increases blood flow,

736
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,164
for poor cerebral circulation...

737
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:49,002
So Cinazyn
helps circulation: out!

738
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,290
Dear Diary,
the vaccines have arrived.

739
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,486
Just to be sure, I call

740
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,967
an immunologist friend.

741
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,609
Hi Guido, it's Nanni.

742
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,131
Listen,
it's too long to explain.

743
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,325
A month and a half ago,
I had tests

744
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,966
and discovered I was allergic
to many foods.

745
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:29,000
I ordered a vaccine which arrived...

746
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,408
What? Anaphylactic shock?

747
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,611
He tells me
the vaccines are useless

748
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:42,088
and can make you go into shock.

749
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,330
That is not a food allergy...

750
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,970
Allergy gives hives,
a rash, not just an itch.

751
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,965
I go back to seeing dermatologists.

752
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,965
There's one
not to famous as the Prince

753
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,689
who I've heard good things about.
I make an appointment with him.

754
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,126
My Vespa is broken,
so I take the car.

755
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,171
Stuck in traffic for one hour,
you get jumpy in traffic.

756
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,606
You go to the doctor
because you're sick,

757
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,121
Yo“ Pay to hear:

758
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:26,889
you're acting like a loser.
It's psychological,

759
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,607
depends on you.
I see you are acting like a loser.

760
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,883
- Why are you scratching?
- The itch...

761
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,800
There's no urgent need,
but you're scratching.

762
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,808
Anyway, Trimeton,
one shot daily for seven days.

763
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:48,768
Fenistil, one pill at night,
Legederm cream, when needed.

764
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,571
Thank you.

765
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:56,686
I've given you the treatment,
but remember: it depends on you.

766
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:04,045
Now I'm convinced that the cause
of this itch is psychological.

767
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,804
It depends on me,
it's my fault, only my fault.

768
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,171
I try to remember
what happened 8 months ago

769
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,961
when the itching started.

770
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,242
It depends on me,
he says I have to cooperate,

771
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,446
force myself not to scratch.

772
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,889
It all depends on me.

773
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:30,925
If it depends on me,
I'm sure I won't make it.

774
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,564
My mother gave me silk pyjamas

775
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,042
and linen sheets
to alleviate the itch.

776
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,131
Now, at night,
it's not just an itch.

777
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:54,289
I wake up after half an hour.

778
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,809
I sleep an hour and a half,
two hours.

779
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,849
I've been treating this lady...

780
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,442
After a few sessions,
her cholesterol went down.

781
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,007
Satisfying.

782
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,400
I'm at loss with my itch.

783
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:24,323
Avoid all red foods: tomatoes,
carrots, oranges, strawberries.

784
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,363
Red foods, nil!

785
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:31,244
Last night
I didn't stop scratching...

786
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,364
You've hurt your big toe.

787
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,883
The toe is the head: you wanted
to hurt your head last night.

788
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,040
So should I put a cream on it?

789
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,845
Use a compress
with cabbage leaves.

790
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:50,683
Take the leaves, dip them in boiling
water and make a compress. It's better.

791
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,564
I see. Perfect.

792
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:00,529
I didn't know if those massages
would do me good,

793
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,642
but they'd do no harm.

794
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,401
It was pleasant,

795
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,370
that half hour relaxed me.

796
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,443
The reflexologist
prescribed calendula cream,

797
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,201
the Ribes Nigrum
and Tilia Tomentosa.

798
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,769
And told me to take bran baths.

799
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,246
I continue to lose weight
and I get night sweats.

800
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,883
I go to a Chinese Medical Center.

801
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,761
Two doctors, Chu Hu and Yang,
examine me.

802
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:02,681
They take my pulse,
then trade places.

803
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,964
Have you been exposed to wind?

804
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,762
Wind? Well, I ride a Vespa,
but Rome isn't that windy...

805
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:37,489
In traditional Chinese medicine
itch corresponds to wind in the blood.

806
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,328
Stick out your tongue.
It's white, sticky.

807
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,689
Fallen kidneys?

808
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,964
Fallen kidneys?

809
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,849
Dr. Yang asks
if you're overindulged in sex.

810
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,325
No.

811
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,281
- Hurt you?
- A bit.

812
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,725
The last two, okay?

813
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,924
Very good.

814
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:09,091
Dr. Yang leaves me
alone in the room.

815
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,801
He leaves me for 15 minutes,

816
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,526
I even doze off.

817
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,361
Then he returns.

818
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,962
- How are you?
- Fine.

819
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,845
- You feel a little heat?
- Yes.

820
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,521
For now,
acupuncture has no effect

821
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,246
on the itch or the insomnia.

822
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,730
At the Chinese Medical Center
they're nice.

823
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,767
There's a pleasant atmosphere,
so I keep trying.

824
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,806
Hold tight, like that.

825
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,727
- How's that?
- Fine.

826
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,525
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

827
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,441
- Can I turn it up?
- Yes.

828
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,606
To treat the itch
they try electric acupuncture,

829
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:18,327
with something they call
a "plum flower needle".

830
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,448
But Dr. Yang
notices my cough,

831
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,291
says the treatment's
not working, isn't correct.

832
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,403
It would be best
to do a chest X-ray.

833
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,523
Take your jacket off.

834
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,209
The t-shirt too?

835
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,051
No, just the jacket,
it has buttons.

836
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,242
Hold the box,

837
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,730
chin slightly lifted.

838
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,569
Breathe.

839
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,006
Hold it.

840
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,328
Don't breathe.

841
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,169
The technician
develops the X-ray,

842
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,403
Tells Silvia
there's a mass around the lung

843
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,486
and says to get
a CAT scan right away.

844
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,804
Is it disgusting?

845
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,171
- No, tastes like anisette.
- In that case...

846
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,366
Don't breathe, don't move.

847
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,171
Breathe.

848
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,329
Stop, don't breathe.

849
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,404
Breathe.

850
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,768
Stop, don't breathe.

851
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,330
Breathe.

852
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,047
While I'm getting
the CAT scan of my head,

853
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,881
the radiologist
examines the chest scan.

854
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,647
He talks about it
with Silvia and Angelo.

855
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,408
Says he thinks I have
a sarcoma of the lung.

856
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,730
They ask what a sarcoma is.
"Lung cancer."

857
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:30,529
According to him, any attempt
at treatment would be useless.

858
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:36,722
Luckily, the radiologist
guessed wrong.

859
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,164
They operate two days later

860
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,129
and a doctor friend
present at the operation

861
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,689
says later that the surgeon,

862
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,169
looking at a piece he'd cut out,

863
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,520
said:

864
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,210
<i>"I'll</i> bet my ball
this is Hodgkin's lymphoma."

865
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,322
"Not both balls, but one yes."

866
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:05,124
Hodgkin's is a cancer
of the lymphatic system

867
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,930
a treatable cancer.

868
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:15,084
One day, at home,
I leaf through a handbook of medicine.

869
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,683
Under "Lymphoma" it says:

870
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:24,041
"Symptoms include itch,
weight loss, and sweating."

871
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,367
I have learned one thing
from this story.

872
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,522
Or rather two:

873
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:39,842
first, that doctors know how to talk
but don't know how to listen.

874
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:45,723
And now I'm surrounded
by all useless medicines

875
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,130
I took over the course of a year.

876
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:57,009
The second thing I learned is that
in the morning, before breakfast,

877
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,805
it's healthy
to drink a glass of water.

878
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,323
They say it's good
for the kidneys, or something...

879
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,930
Anyway, it's healthy.

880
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:12,442
Well then:
a light cappuccino, a roll...

881
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,768
And a glass of water.

882
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,007
