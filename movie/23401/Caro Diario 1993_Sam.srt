<i>Moretti: In Rome, the cinemas
are closed for the summer,</i>

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,776
<i>or at least they show such films as
"Sex love and sheep",</i>

6
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,377
<i>"Beastly desires",
"Snow white and the seven black dwarves",</i>

7

8
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,767

to come back into play.</i>

10

11
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,057

in these years, I wonder...</i>

12
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,859

<i>(Man #3) and defeats
begin to be a burden.</i>

15
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,412
...a non-stop series of defeats.

16
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,219
Our generation...
What's become of us?

17
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,015
Advertisers, architects, stock agents,
deputies, aldermen..

18
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,408
...journalists.

19
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,652
We have changed, we're worse,

20
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,857
nowadays we're all accomplices.

21
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,535
But why this obsession?

22
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,534
"All equal, all compromised,
we're all accomplices"...

23
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,009
Can you tell me when
we last had a walk together?

24
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,250
We are together
only from force of habit.

25
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,933
You're ashamed of me.

26
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,894
What a headache, even
"Optalidon" is no longer the same.

27
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,777
Remember how reassuring
its old tube used to be?

28
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,328
Everything is different now.

29
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,470
You know, Antonio?
You're getting worse and worse.

30
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,694
You can no longer feel
anything real now.

31
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,409
We are old, we're soured,
we are dishonest in our jobs.

32
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,930
We used to shout horrendous,
violent things, in our marches

33
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,654
and now look
how ugly we got.

34

<i>Moretti: YOU used to shout
horrendous and violent things</i>

35
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,411

36
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,532

is to see the houses,</i>

39

<i>to see the districts,</i>

40
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,769
<i>and the district that I prefer
is the Garbatella.</i>

41
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,022
<i>I walk around
the council houses there.</i>

42
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,170
<i>However I don't like to see
the houses only from the outside,</i>

43
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,855
<i>Sometimes I like to see
what they look like inside too.</i>

44
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,294
<i>Therefore, I ring some bell
and say I need to check the place</i>

45
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,837
<i>because I am preparing a film.</i>

46
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:15,360
<i>The landlords usually ask me:
"What's this film about?"</i>

47
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,816
<i>and I never know what to say.</i>

48
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,372
This film is the story
of a Trotskian confectioner

49
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,972
and it's set in Italy in the '50s.
It's a musical.

50
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,139
A musical.

51
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:34,916
<i>Moretti: By the way, a musical about
a Trotskian confectioner wouldn't be bad at all,</i>

52
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:38,154

conformist Italy of the '50s.</i>

53

<i>When I ride my motor scooter,
I also like to stop and watch the attics</i>

<i>where I would like to live.</i>

55
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,978
<i>I imagine myself renovating the apartments</i>

56
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,495
<i>high above, those that I see
from the road,</i>

57
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,745
<i>apartments whose owners
have no intention to sell.</i>

58
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,331
<i>One day I saw an attic
that seemed to me more accessible.</i>

59
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,443
<i>Silvia and I also went to check it.</i>

60
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,491
<i>We asked how much it cost,</i>

61
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,190
<i>and the answer was:
"Ten million lire per square meter".</i>

62
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,057
<i>How, "Ten million lire per square meter"?</i>

63

69
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,774
Want to know what I was thinking of?
A very sad thing.

70
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,305
That I, even in a more decent
society than this one,

71
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:19,113
will always be in the minority,

72
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:21,856
but not as in those films where
there are a man and a woman

73
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,739
who hate one another and tear
each other to pieces on a desert island

74
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,015
because the director of the film
doesn't believe in people.

75
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,419
I believe in people.

76
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,969
I don't believe
in the majority of people.

77
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,210
I'm afraid that
I will always be comfortable

78

Cock-a-doodle-doo!

336
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,951
What's the cry of...

337
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,874
Sara, I beg you, call your dad.

338
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,057
A donkey? Eeeeh-oooh!

339
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,633
You knew, it didn't you?
I don't know all of them!

340
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:41,132
<i>Moretti: Salina has been
dominated by only children for years.</i>

341
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,072
<i>Every family...</i>

342
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,277
<i>Lorenzo: cheep-cheep,
the chick goes "cheep-cheep".</i>

343
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,629
<i>Moretti: Every family
had an only child,</i>

344
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,892
<i>who now
controls everything.</i>

345
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,714
<i>It was impossible
to phone anyone.</i>

346
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,733
<i>because phones
were intercepted by kids, who...</i>

347
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:11,825
Hi I am Rosanna, can you put
your mom or daddy through?

348
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,172
Okay. Bye.

349
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,269
Paolo?

350
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,068
Giovanni?

351
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,268
Leandro, do you recognize me?
What's my name?

352
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:22,788
Hello? This is Paolo.

353
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,356
What's your name? How old are you?
Do you recognize me? What's my name?

354
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,509
I am Franco.

355
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,153
The piglet?

356
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,673
And the hippo?

357
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,878
The giraffe, I wouldn’t know.
(Grunts) This is the piglet.

358
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,548
The giraffe and the swallow,
I wouldn't know.

359
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,274
Listen, who's in the house,
mom or dad?

360
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,444
Mom and dad are in the house,
but I'll tell you a fable.

361
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
So...

362
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,394
(Articulates) Do you und-er-stand
what I'm say-ing?

363
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,318
(DESPERATE VOICES ASKING
TO SPEAK WITH PARENTS)

364
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,424
The piglet.
(Grunts).

365
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,231
(MUSIC)

366
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,039
- No! No!
- Wake up! Wake up!

367
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,078
The light!

368
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,595
Gerardo, wake up!

369
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,910
Daniele is awake
and waiting for us.

370
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,194
In 15 minutes the worse
moment of the day will come.

371
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:59,557
- But why?
- It'll be three o'clock,

372
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:01,519
the hour of the wolf.

373
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,366
It's the worse hour,
the hour when you feel lonely.

374
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:08,161
For twelve years, we've waken up
Daniele at three o'clock

375
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:10,204
and brought him in bed with us.

376
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:11,193
Come on in as well.

377
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,003
<i>- Moretti: May I?
- Dad: Please, come in.</i>

378
00:43:13,203 --> 00:43:15,282
- So, Daniele, how's tonight going?
- Well.

379
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:16,601
- Are you scared?
- No.

380
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:19,093
Can you see how many of us
are here to keep you company?

381
00:43:19,293 --> 00:43:21,280
Under the cover, come on!

382
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,993
Are you sure
you aren't afraid?

383
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,633
Yes! Yes!

384
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,477
Did you know that Daniele
has never had a baby-sitter?

385
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,039
Hasn't he? Why?

386
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,237
Because we've always
stayed with him.

387
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,072
You've never gone out?

388
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,111
Never. And so
we've read everything.

389
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,872
We've read Von Kleinst...

390
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,916
Hegel...

391
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,149
Spinoza...

392
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,009
We've read... Federico Tozzi...

393
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:45,680
We've read everything
about Xenophon...

394
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,813
- Svevo...
- And then Herodotus.

395
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,995
And then?

396
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:51,026
Tacitus!

397
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:52,837
All Tacitus!

398
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,309
Then... we have...

399
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,799
Saint Augustine.

400
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,594
Saint Augustine, Delfini,
Meneghello and Capitini.

401
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,472
Cicero, over and over again.

402
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,618
and Rousseau, Leibniz...

403
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:07,561
Wittgenstein.

404
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,268
<i>Moretti: Dear diary, we're passing by
the island of Panarea.</i>

405
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,755
<i>Gerardo says
he has never been there...</i>

406
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,118
<i>...but he can list
all its pubs and discos,</i>

407
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:32,371
<i>restaurants and beer houses.</i>

408
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,071
<i>We decide not to get off
and to continue for Stromboli..</i>

409
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:45,926
<i>...where we are certain
that we'll finally succeed...</i>

410
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,608
A few verses by Tibullus
came to my mind.

411
00:44:57,808 --> 00:44:59,994
They describe the situation we're in,

412
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,071
when we watch TV.

413
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,640
"Quam juvat"... How beautiful it is,

414
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,355
to sprawl on the bed
or an armchair... "cubantem"...

415
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:13,542
and listen to the impetuous winds,
"immites ventos"...

416
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:15,357
which fight against each other.

417
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,003
They came to my mind while I was watching
"A round terrace by the sea".

418
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,112
Give me the list!

419
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,269
Stop it!

420
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,430
Give me the list
with the things...

421
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,511
...that you had to force me to do!

422
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,062
Listen: I don't have
to waste my time, ever!

423
00:46:08,262 --> 00:46:09,956
<i>Moretti: I had been told</i>

424
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,713
<i>that when one gets to Stromboli,
they immediately feel</i>

425
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,515
<i>the threatening presence
of the volcano.</i>

426
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,319
<i>Gerardo and I started
to fight at once.</i>

427
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,391
<i>Why hadn't he reminded me</i>

428
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,436
<i>that I was there to work?</i>

429
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,317
<i>I had given him a list</i>

430
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,277
<i>of the things I had to do..</i>

431
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,378
<i>but I had only wasted time
since I'd been there.</i>

432
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,487
I am the mayor, my pleasure!
Professor!

433
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:52,623
Good morning.

434
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,408
Please be our guests.

435
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:57,817
No, thanks, we'll book a hotel.
We have to concentrate.

436
00:46:58,017 --> 00:47:00,560
There's a house of some friends'
which is fit for you, come on!

437
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,112
The agronomist in charge of
the 28.000 hectares is coming here...

438
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,758
...hectares which surround Tokyo.

439
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,851
He wants to discuss
about my projects with me.

440
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:10,967
Riccardo!

441
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,398
He wants to understand the secret
of our equilibrium between growth and comfort.

442
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,192
Riccardo, that's me!

443
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,323
Listen, I have abandoned
the ideal of boulevards

444
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,090
with palms
imported from Los Angeles.

445
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:30,322
I'd like to give back to the island
its lost traditions,

446
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,721
and then squares, roads,
gardens, fountains, theatres...

447
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,850
Riccardo, they don't know
where to sleep!

448
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,260
<i>Riccardo: Enough!</i>

449
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:49,242
Sorry, I have so many projects,
but all end up badly.

450
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:56,247
Everyone is so hostile here...
How come?

451
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,561
These two friends need hospitality,
if you're kind enough...

452
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,045
All the contrary of Amsterdam,

453
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:09,260
where at night you pass by
lunch tables, halls and bedrooms,

454
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,999
and they're all floodlit, all visible.

455
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,452
A life without curtains.

456
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,141
I am the mayor!
You cannot treat me like that!

457
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,614
They need to concentrate
for three or four days!

458
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:02,979
They won't collaborate,
there's nothing I can do.

459
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:05,649
Maybe it's the threatening
presence of the volcano.

460
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,370
Yet there would be
enough human material.

461
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,920
In Stromboli there's a mixture
of Italians and Germans...

462
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,838
...very interesting.

463
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:18,346
The families are big,
not like in Salina and its zero growth.

464
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:21,490
<i>Mayor: For example
I have three kids.</i>

465
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:28,115
So much wasted potential.
What a pity!

466
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,529
From now on
you can only go on foot.

467
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,089
Along this path?

468
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,003
You follow the path, regular
footsteps, without forcing.

469
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,366
Will you excuse me, I'm waiting
for the Japanese agronomist to call.

470
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,916
He's responsible for the 28.000 hectares
that surround Tokyo.

471
00:49:56,917 --> 00:50:00,058
See you tomorrow, then.

472
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,889
(NOISES FROM THE VOLCANO)

473
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:52,132
There is something hypnotic,
an ancient bond between...

474
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:53,848
Don't turn around!

475
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,763
Don't turn around!

476
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,085
What's happening?

477
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:00,151
A group of Americans,
at the shelter.

478
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,196
I need a favour,
I am ashamed.

479
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,529
I would like to know

480
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,438
if Sally Spectra told
her husband that she's pregnant.

481
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,962
"Bold and the Beautiful", the soap.

482
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,326
In America they're ahead...

483
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,474
Oh, yes,
they're a few seasons ahead...

484
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:21,758
And ask them if Stephanie has found out
anything, after placing the microphones..

485
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,087
...in the house of the new wife
of her ex-husband.

486
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:07,612
(Shouting) But... Nancy...
Whose wife is she?

487
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:09,885
<i>Gerardo (shouting): Thorn's!</i>

488
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,201
(Shouting) But where has
Stephanie placed the microphones?

489
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,487
<i>Gerardo (shouting): In the house
of the wife of her ex!</i>

490
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,687
(Shouting) But why?

491
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,648
<i>Gerardo (shouting): Because she's jealous!</i>

492
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,558
Hello!

493
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,766
Excuse me, good morning.

494
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,287
Could you tell me if Sally...

495
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,522
(Shouting) What was
Sally Spectra's problem?

496
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:01,353
<i>Gerardo (shouting): she's pregnant,
does her husband know it or no?</i>

497
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:10,231
"...if Sally Spectra has told
her husband that she is pregnant?

498
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:12,564
Sally Spectra from
"Bold and the Beautiful"?

499
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:13,759
"Beautiful", yes.

500
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,039
Yes, she has.

501
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,286
(Shouting) She has told him!

502
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,952
The last question:

503
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,645
"If Thorn is working
on fixing his marriage,

504
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,317
"or is Nancy in love
with her tennis instructor?

505
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,324
Right now, Nancy is madly in love
with her tennis instructor.

506
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,712
Now, at this moment?
In these episodes?

507
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:43,177
(Shouting) Nancy is crazy
about her tennis teacher!

508
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:47,423
(Shouting) There are no hopes
for Thorn!

509
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,042
I am so envious of the music
that you can always listen to in Panarea.

510
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,439
What do you think? I'd like to ask
to Ennio Morricone..

511
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,808
if he wanted to write
the soundtrack for this place.

512
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:08,624
Huh, could be an idea.

513
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:10,760
Like that western, how does it go?

514
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:12,550
- Shon shon?
- Yeah!

515
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,134
(THEY SING "SHON SHON")

516
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,174
Exactly.

517
00:54:15,374 --> 00:54:18,160
Best wishes, for everything,

518
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,210
maybe we won't
meet anymore, however.

519
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:24,438
And a director of photography
in charge of the light of the island...

520
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:30,474
Storaro who takes care of the lights
and the sunsets of Stromboli!

521
00:54:30,674 --> 00:54:33,130
Rebuild Stromboli from zero!

522
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,480
<i>Mayor: Rebuild Italy from zero!</i>

523
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,242
<i>(Excited) A new way of life,</i>

524
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,798
new light, new clothes,
new sounds,

525
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,280
a new way of speaking,
new colours, new taste..

526
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,031
(Shouting) all new!

527
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,961
(Humming) Shon shon.

528
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:59,677
(MAYOR HUMS "A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE'
SOUNDTRACK)

529
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,326
No, listen, let's go to Panarea.

530
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,409
Let's go to Panarea.

531
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,481
Regina: Welcome!
Excuse me.

532
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,045
Welcome to Panarea.
Where are you coming from?

533
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,205
Stromboli.

534
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,809
What a bore.

535
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,764
I am preparing a party
in honour of the bad taste.

536
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,489
It almost took me a year
to organize it.

537
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,528
Helmut Berger said that he'll come
in underpants directly.

538
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,439
And then on Saturday
there's my divorce party.

539
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,686
Do you always organize
such things?

540
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:51,121
We can provide you with anything
you need. Cocktail, dinners, journeys...

541
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,649
...settings.

542
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,802
<i>Regina: I can find a white elephant
for an exotic dinner,</i>

543
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,245
<i>...or an amazing photographer
for a marriage..</i>

544
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,719
...or a watussi to liven up
a worldly evening.

545
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,246
Ideas, creativeness,
atmospheres, contacts...

546
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,830
(Together): Good-bye and thanks!

547
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:37,081
Dear diary, I'm happy
only by the sea, while I'm travelling...

548
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:44,344
...between an island that I've just left
and another one that I still have to reach.

549
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:52,293
We are going to Alicudi now,
the most distant and wildest island of all.

550
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,926
I am sure that you're against
the programme "Who has seen them?"

551
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,887
Should we deny Ulysses,
after the fall of Troy

552
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,439
the right
to wander about the seas

553
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,443
stopping by Circe,
Calypso, Nausikaa?

554
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,403
Certainly not.

555
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,249
If we did that, we would not have
the Odyssey.

556
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,119
And should we deny
his relatives who remained in Ithaca

557
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,326
the right to look for him?

558
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:26,009
And so Telemachus goes around
to ask news of his father.

559
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,764
and what he asks is:
"Who has seen him?"

560
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:55,837
<i>Moretti: Good morning.</i>

561
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,639
There's no salvation for Italy.

562
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,642
He is waiting for you.

563
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:03,680
"He" who?

564
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,483
A man who has refused
success and glory.

565
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,367
He hates narcissism.

566
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,919
We all hate narcissism here,

567
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:15,344
and Alicudi welcomes only
those who share its same beliefs.

568
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,404
Man: Here you can find
the energy you need for your work.

569
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:28,562
Man: Alicudi will give you something
which the other islands won't.

570
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:33,201
Moretti: I know, I was told that.
Is it going to take long yet?

571
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,718
Man: Yes.

572
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,079
Moretti: Aren't there any other roads?

573
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,320
Man: There are no
roads at all here.

574
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,703
Aren't there?

575
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,552
- Listen, this person...
- Lucio.

576
00:59:46,752 --> 00:59:48,241
Who is waiting for us, yes...

577
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:50,750
He wrote a very
successful book a long time ago.

578
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,774
- Too much successful.
- Too much successful...

579
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:57,116
He came here to expiate.

580
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,404
Alicudi is the most
island of all islands.

581
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,751
I know.

582
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:07,542
I don't like the other islands.
Everyone is compromised there.

583
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:13,766
They don't know how to live alone.
Here we all live alone.

584
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:30,626
Enzensberger says
that television is nothing.

585
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:32,049
Moretti: Mh...

586
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:38,926
But tell me that the match
Honduras-Belgium, 3-2

587
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,841
...with five straight overthrows...

588
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:41,908
is "nothing".

589
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,393
Exactly...

590
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,363
<i>To me that "nothing"
seemed a lot.</i>

591
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:48,639
And to you too.

592
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,562
Alright, to me too.

593
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,488
And that penalty...

594
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:02,730
Yes but I have to solve the problem
with the lack of shutters.

595
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:12,423
Because I know that
tomorrow I'll wake up at dawn.

596
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:18,165
I can only sleep in total dark.

597
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,928
Yes, I admit it.

598
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,443
What?

599
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,608
Maybe I have exaggerated
a little about television...

600
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,844
It's alright.

601
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,926
However, it's history now.

602
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:37,769
Of course. Now we're here,
calm, on this island...

603
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:54,904
Ah, you're here.

604
01:01:55,116 --> 01:01:59,577
I never go out.
Because human beings are dreadful.

605
01:01:59,777 --> 01:02:01,991
Yes...
I can't sleep in the light.

606
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:05,666
Since there are no shutters,
do you have some tape?

607
01:02:05,876 --> 01:02:07,835
- Look there.
- Yes, I wanted to equip...

608
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:08,925
Certainly.

609
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,788
Because I got some cardboard,
and so...

610
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:13,192
I want to live here without roots.

611
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:16,152
Our roots are too heavy.

612
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:20,669
For the last few years I have been
ashamed of Italy and its people.

613
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,710
I have been ashamed
of the other islands:

614
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:27,929
avid, fat,
ignorant, narcissist.

615
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:33,551
where people
who don't feel guilty live.

616
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:38,991
We retired here
to think about the others.

617
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:45,204
Italians are the most easily
influenced and vulgar people of all.

618
01:02:46,076 --> 01:02:49,751
This country needs
to laugh so unbridledly.

619
01:02:50,356 --> 01:02:52,764
What's there to laugh for?

620
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:56,189
Do you mind if I eat the crust?

621
01:02:56,396 --> 01:02:59,752
<i>Moretti: And we have been
in Alicudi for a few days.</i>

622
01:02:59,996 --> 01:03:03,432
<i>It is really a different island
from the others</i>

623
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:08,859
<i>where we finally succeed
into concentrating.</i>

624
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:11,194
<i>Everything's quiet here.</i>

625
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:17,922
<i>Terribly quiet.</i>

626
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,554
Are you working?

627
01:03:21,156 --> 01:03:24,785
I'm writing my diary
however, in these days...

628
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:28,073
I am writing
a letter to the Pope,

629
01:03:28,276 --> 01:03:30,836
because he has excommunicated
soap operas.

630
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:33,329
He says that they're a danger
to the unity of the family.

631
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:34,485
I'll read it.

632
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:40,319
"Dear Holy Father, forgive me,
but you're wrong.

633
01:03:40,636 --> 01:03:43,867
"Our families are closed
in their selfishness

634
01:03:44,076 --> 01:03:47,705

644
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:21,509
I haven't watched TV for a few days,

645
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:23,712
but I don't miss it.

646
01:04:23,956 --> 01:04:25,947
However on this island...

647
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:27,469
<i>On this island?</i>

648
01:04:27,716 --> 01:04:29,388
There is no electricity.

649
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:30,785
So what?

650
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,635
There are no televisions in Alicudi.

651
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,555
(Shouting) Television!

652
01:04:40,236 --> 01:04:41,954
Elevator!

653
01:04:43,276 --> 01:04:45,551
Telephone!

654
01:04:46,676 --> 01:04:50,690
Hot Water!
Wait for me!

655
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:54,169
Television!

656
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:58,748
(Shouting) But how can you
live without television?

657
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:01,585
Stop! Stop!

658
01:05:01,836 --> 01:05:05,431
I feel pity on Enzensberger
when he says..

659
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:08,742
that TV transmits nothing!

660
01:05:10,268 --> 01:05:11,653
Stop!

661
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,490
KarI Popper, you're wrong!

662
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:19,595
It's not true for television
to contaminate children!

663
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:27,653
On the contrary, children
don't get stunned watching television!

664
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:37,331
They dream! As once they dreamt
listening to fables and legends!

665
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:41,937
CHAPTER III:
Doctors.

666
01:06:09,276 --> 01:06:15,833
<i>Moretti: Dear diary, I've kept
the prescriptions I gathered in one year,</i>

667
01:06:17,036 --> 01:06:23,634
<i>and also the notes I took
when I met the physicians...</i>

668
01:06:24,156 --> 01:06:30,057
<i>therefore nothing in this chapter
is invented: prescriptions...</i>

669
01:06:30,956 --> 01:06:35,149
<i>...meetings with the physicians,
conversations with them.</i>

670
01:06:41,286 --> 01:06:44,884
Okay, at 1.30 at home,
it's alright, thanks. Bye.

671
01:06:45,516 --> 01:06:48,992
At 1.30 at home,
then we'll do it again.

672
01:06:54,196 --> 01:06:56,758
<i>Moretti: This is my last
session of chemotherapy,</i>

673
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:59,356
<i>the cure one has to follow
when they have a tumour.</i>

674
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:02,075
<i>So I decided
to film it.</i>

675
01:07:07,636 --> 01:07:11,089
Well, only for a while, inevitably.

676
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:16,326
That is true, however.
No, no, it is true.

677
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:20,644
Mind the ear.

678
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,679
<i>Woman: It's still too low.</i>

679
01:07:28,886 --> 01:07:30,430
No, no, you go, go.

680
01:07:34,439 --> 01:07:38,546
It's tight enough.
It keeps his hair up.

681
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,706
Is it alright?

682
01:08:35,606 --> 01:08:36,880
Doctor?

683
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,161
<i>Doctor: Yes?</i>

684
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:39,839
Is there any "Deticene" in it?

685
01:08:39,926 --> 01:08:42,724
<i>Yes, but wouldn't it be better
for you not to know?</i>

686
01:08:42,806 --> 01:08:43,841
<i>Does it sting?</i>

687
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:46,902
No, no, just a little.
Let's leave it for now, but stay here.

688
01:08:47,006 --> 01:08:49,520
<i>Moretti: One day I started
to have the itches</i>

689
01:08:49,606 --> 01:08:51,324
<i>above all at night.</i>

690
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:56,304
<i>I thought it was urticaria,
but it wasn't, it had nothing to do with it.</i>

691
01:08:57,646 --> 01:09:01,036
<i>I had heard
of a dermatological institute,</i>

692
01:09:01,206 --> 01:09:02,974
<i>...very famous.</i>

693
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:06,243
<i>A lot of people go there at dawn</i>

694
01:09:06,766 --> 01:09:10,401
<i>and wait all day to be visited.</i>

695
01:09:10,966 --> 01:09:13,036
(BUZZ)

696
01:09:31,086 --> 01:09:36,630
Moretti, Giovanni, born in Brunico
on 19th August 1953, living in Rome.

697
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:39,478
Have you ever been cured
for the same disease before?

698
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:40,601
No, this is the first time.

699
01:09:40,686 --> 01:09:43,761
- What's your problem?
- I have very bad itch.

700
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,215
How long ago did it start?

701
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:47,194
A few weeks,
almost one month ago.

702
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:50,200
- Where?
- On my feet and arms.

703
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,834
- When is it worse?
- At night, above all at night.

704
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:58,118
Your skin is a little dry,
let's see.

705
01:09:58,526 --> 01:09:59,595
Yes.

706
01:10:00,606 --> 01:10:02,119
Hold it.

707
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:04,436
At first I feared
it would be scabies...

708
01:10:04,646 --> 01:10:08,161
No, that illness concerns
other social classes.

709
01:10:15,766 --> 01:10:18,069
Yes, there is a reaction.

710
01:10:18,686 --> 01:10:20,244
Have you ever had hepatitis?

711
01:10:20,406 --> 01:10:22,283
A long time ago.

712
01:10:22,446 --> 01:10:24,801
Any other
important diseases?

713
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:26,082
No.

714
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:29,700
- Do you eat?
- How, "do I eat"?

715
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,044
- Do you have appetite?
- Yes, I do.

716
01:10:33,286 --> 01:10:36,244
You should go
to a warmer place, to the seaside.

717
01:10:36,446 --> 01:10:40,325
In winter one's skin gets dry
and the cold increases these symptoms.

718
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,362
Alright.

719
01:10:41,526 --> 01:10:44,882
So, I'll give you: pills of Histamen,
an hour before dinner.

720
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:45,836
Yes.

721
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:49,436
Flantadin, a tablet in the morning
for a week..

722
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:52,601
half a tablet still in morning,
for the second week.

723
01:10:58,646 --> 01:11:02,721
<i>Moretti: I took all the medicine,
but the itching didn't stop.</i>

724
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:07,325
<i>I returned to the institute,
but the physician wasn't there that day</i>

725
01:11:07,526 --> 01:11:09,278
<i>the one who had visited me.</i>

726
01:11:09,486 --> 01:11:11,851
<i>So another one visited me.</i>

727
01:11:13,246 --> 01:11:15,680
You have a very dry skin
which need hydrating.

728
01:11:15,766 --> 01:11:16,562
I know.

729
01:11:16,846 --> 01:11:19,406
Listen, do you have a coin
in your pocket by chance?

730
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:20,436
A coin?

731
01:11:20,646 --> 01:11:21,920
Any coin...

732
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,325
Mind the naevuses.

733
01:11:27,486 --> 01:11:28,919
Yes, yes.

734
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:34,718
Thanks.

735
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:39,718
There is an evident dermographism,
sign of a food allergy.

736
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:42,287
You can dress again.

737
01:11:48,966 --> 01:11:51,844
Maybe it's a nervous problem,

738
01:11:52,846 --> 01:11:54,165
due to the life that we live,

739
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:56,402
...that you live, Mr. Moretti.

740
01:11:56,606 --> 01:11:59,837
However, this is the prescription
by your colleague:

741
01:12:00,046 --> 01:12:01,559
...Histamen, Fitamid.

742
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:03,802
Should I keep taking...

743
01:12:04,034 --> 01:12:07,277
No, no, we need to have your blood
analysed, hemochrome, ESR,

744
01:12:07,486 --> 01:12:09,397
then I'll prescribe you the meds.

745
01:12:09,606 --> 01:12:14,077
I'll also give you: Fristamin,
one every morning for a month..

746
01:12:14,406 --> 01:12:16,078
Prazene in drops...

747
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:21,717
Hematocrit: 46, hemoglobinic rate..

748
01:12:21,926 --> 01:12:25,635
..16,3 = 102, red globules...

749
01:12:26,686 --> 01:12:30,964
<i>Moretti: The results are good,</i>

750
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:35,473
<i>but my itch continues
and increases,</i>

751
01:12:35,606 --> 01:12:39,440
<i>so I remember the name
of a famous dermatologist</i>

752
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:42,762
<i>a kind of "prince"
of the dermatologists</i>

753
01:12:42,962 --> 01:12:47,364
<i>and so I call the study
of this "prince".</i>

754
01:12:52,366 --> 01:12:56,359
Good morning, I would like
an appointment with the professor, please.

755
01:12:57,886 --> 01:13:00,002
How come it is not possible
before three months?

756
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:03,124
It is an urgent thing,
I have a very bad itch...

757
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:09,202
Which substitute?
The assistant of the professor?

758
01:13:09,726 --> 01:13:14,318
Oh, the patients in excess are sent to him...

759
01:13:14,326 --> 01:13:17,423
It is alright, give me the number
of the substitute.

760
01:13:18,326 --> 01:13:23,482
32... Thanks, good-bye.

761
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:27,637
Are you going through
a particular period of stress?

762
01:13:27,806 --> 01:13:29,364
Yes, because of the itch, however.

763
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:31,477
Do you drink much coffee or tea?

764
01:13:31,686 --> 01:13:32,960
I drink a lot of tea.

765
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:38,764
You can't drink more than a cup of tea
or coffee, or a coke a day.

766
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:45,201
Alright. This medicine
was prescribed to me by the other doctors.

767
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:48,039
I know them, they're superb colleagues.

768
01:13:48,286 --> 01:13:50,197
However, I'll give you something else.

769
01:13:50,446 --> 01:13:53,040
I'll give you: Anfo 3 for the shower..

770
01:13:53,286 --> 01:13:55,800
then, after the shower, ldroskin..

771
01:13:56,406 --> 01:14:04,916
then Infloran, a tablet
in the morning on an empty stomach.

772
01:14:07,926 --> 01:14:17,801
Then Atarax, a tablet
in the morning and one in the afternoon.

773
01:14:18,046 --> 01:14:21,322
<i>Moretti: I like to take
medicine and to believe</i>

774
01:14:21,566 --> 01:14:23,158
<i>...that it works</i>

775
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:26,350
<i>However the substitute seemed embarrassed</i>

776
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:30,796
<i>and so I couldn't trust him.</i>

777
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:33,076
<i>That was the only time</i>

778
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:35,965
<i>when I didn't go
to buy the medicine.</i>

779
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,564
<i>Then I returned to the
dermatological institute</i>

780
01:14:40,846 --> 01:14:45,840
<i>not to the dermatology ward,
but to the allergology one.</i>

781
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:59,135
- With these tests...
- Mind the naevuses please...

782
01:14:59,846 --> 01:15:02,918
We'll find out if
you're allergic, as I believe.

783
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,602
Allergist: First of all we'll
test you with groups of substances:

784
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:09,274
...food, dusts, pollens...

785
01:15:10,286 --> 01:15:13,224
and then we'll locate
every single substance.

786
01:15:16,326 --> 01:15:20,644
<i>Moretti: I was given thirty punctures
a day for seven days.</i>

787
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:23,723
<i>So far the results are
that I'm allergic to a few groups,</i>

788
01:15:23,806 --> 01:15:27,765
<i>such as milk and by-products, walnuts
and seeds, fish, pork meat.</i>

789
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:31,915
<i>Afterwards they'll single out
the various types of food</i>

790
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:36,119
<i>that I'm allergic to specifically,
and that I cannot eat.</i>

791
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,234
I'm allergic
to many types of food,

792
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:42,437
so I have to order a vaccine.

793
01:15:42,646 --> 01:15:44,125
Here they are:

794
01:15:44,326 --> 01:15:47,796
"Corn, barley, oat, garlic,
onions, mustard, almonds,

795
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:54,212
beans, soy, peas, broad beans,
chickpeas, parsley, artichokes, lettuce, tea,

796
01:15:54,213 --> 01:15:58,165
linseed oil, hop, pepper,
chestnuts, salmon, sardines, tuna,

797
01:15:58,446 --> 01:16:02,155
cow's lactalbumin,
cow's and goat's casein,

798
01:16:02,326 --> 01:16:05,682
gruyere, gorgonzola, parmesan cheese
provolone, Dutch cheese,

799
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:07,561
and swine.

800
01:16:10,046 --> 01:16:13,641
<i>Moretti: The itch continues,
but thanks to the recommendation..</i>

801
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:19,008
<i>by a friend I get
an appointment with the "prince",</i>

802
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:22,496
<i>a few days
before the summer holidays.</i>

803
01:16:23,106 --> 01:16:28,100
Colopten three times a day,
Cinazyn, twenty drops after eating,

804
01:16:28,906 --> 01:16:31,943
a vial of Caprolisin
at 6.00 p.m..

805
01:16:33,066 --> 01:16:38,220
and after dinner, alternate
Fenistil Retard, Xanax and Atarax.

806
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:39,889
An evening one
and an evening the other.

807
01:16:40,089 --> 01:16:41,940
- Yes, alternate.
- Very well.

808
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:46,097
These four products
for your legs and arms,

809
01:16:46,346 --> 01:16:49,437
EcovaI ScaIp Fluid,
for the itch to your head,

810
01:16:49,637 --> 01:16:51,382
three or four drops in the evening.

811
01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:57,855
and wash your hair daily
alternating these three shampoos.

812
01:16:58,598 --> 01:16:59,585
<i>Every day.</i>

813
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:00,821
Every day.

814
01:17:01,026 --> 01:17:02,505
<i>Alright.</i>

815
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:06,540
Moretti, you have to help me.
My family and I are your supporters.

816
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:08,065
<i>Thanks.</i>

817
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:17,464
And even if it's summer, you have to wear
cotton socks up to your knee,

818
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,021
Because I see
that you aren't wearing socks.

819
01:17:20,186 --> 01:17:21,414
Not in summer, no.

820
01:17:21,626 --> 01:17:25,824
Cotton socks up to the knee,
and long-sleeved shirts,

821
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:27,584
also on the beach.

822
01:17:27,786 --> 01:17:31,142
Your skin has to be in touch
with cotton all the time.

823
01:17:31,426 --> 01:17:34,977
And now I'll give you the number
of my holiday home.

824
01:17:35,177 --> 01:17:36,299
Thanks.

825
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:39,863
When you return
you'll feel better already.

826
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:44,181
<i>I hope so, and please excuse me
if I have come all of a sudden.</i>

827
01:17:46,506 --> 01:17:50,497

All of the three?

835
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:11,064
Yes, I have to alternate them.

836
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:15,727

840
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:30,437
<i>Moretti: ...Until one day I read
the pieces of paper which go with the medicine.</i>

841
01:20:30,438 --> 01:20:32,337
<i>I never do it.</i>

842
01:20:32,586 --> 01:20:37,296

854

Quite well thanks.

Listen, I'll spare you the details,

856
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:40,460
however, around a month ago
I did a few tests

857
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:43,385
and resulted allergic
to many types of food.

858
01:21:43,546 --> 01:21:46,265
I ordered some vaccines
which have arrived today.

859
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,058
Of course I...

860
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:53,776
Anaphylactic shock?

861
01:21:54,066 --> 01:21:57,138
<i>Moretti: He tells me that
those vaccines are useless,</i>

862
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:00,782
<i>and that they can also give
anaphylactic shock.</i>

863
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:03,983

with food allergies</i>

864

866
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:14,578
<i>And so I start going
to dermatologists again.</i>

<i>The motor-scooter is broken,

870

More than a hour of traffic

871
01:22:31,986 --> 01:22:34,375
and traffic makes me nervous.

872
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:40,460
One goes to a physician because he feels
sick, and pays them to be told:

873
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:45,065
You're a loser. You have
a psychological problem,

874
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:46,419
it all depends on you.

875
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,975
I am sorry, but you're a loser.

876
01:22:49,146 --> 01:22:51,706
Look at you:
why are you scratching?

877
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:53,538
It itches.

878
01:22:53,746 --> 01:22:57,022
But there is no urgent need for that.
Yet, you're scratching.

879

882
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:09,865
Thanks.

883
01:23:10,066 --> 01:23:14,875
I have given you the medicine,
but remember: it's all up to you.

884
01:23:15,626 --> 01:23:22,626
Today I was convinced that the cause
for my itch is psychological.

885
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:26,808
It depends on me, it's all my fault.

886
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:31,545
I try to remember what I have done,
what happened eight months ago,

887
01:23:31,826 --> 01:23:34,479
when the itching started.

888
01:23:34,986 --> 01:23:39,218
Everything depends on me,
the doctor says I have to collaborate,

889
01:23:39,466 --> 01:23:41,696
resist and not scratch myself.

890
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,958
All depends on me,

891
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,323
and if it depends on me
I am sure that I won't make it.

898

These are things
which give satisfaction.

900
01:24:31,854 --> 01:24:36,422
Of course, but see,
I don't know what else to do with the itch.

901
01:24:36,622 --> 01:24:42,302
You have to avoid all the red food,
tomatoes, carrots, oranges, strawberries.

902
01:24:42,546 --> 01:24:44,855
Really, no red food.

903
01:24:45,306 --> 01:24:49,546
Good, because last night
I've been scratching myself all the time.

904

Yes, I see a wound
on your big toe, here.

905
01:24:52,786 --> 01:24:56,150
The big toe is your head:
you wanted to hurt your head

906
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,668
last night.

907
01:24:57,943 --> 01:25:00,456
And what should I put on it?
Some ointment?

908
01:25:00,656 --> 01:25:03,099
Make a compress
with cabbage leaves.

909
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:07,976
Just half-cook it in hot water
and then apply as a compress.

910
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:09,187
It's much better.

911
01:25:09,387 --> 01:25:11,581
I have understood, that's perfect.

912
01:25:14,466 --> 01:25:18,539
I didn't know if those massages
would do me any good.

913
01:25:18,786 --> 01:25:20,617
But they wouldn't do me any harm.

914
01:25:21,346 --> 01:25:26,804
They were beautiful, pleasant,
very relaxing.

915
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:35,985
The reflexologist prescribed me,
besides the calendula based ointment,

916
01:25:36,226 --> 01:25:40,185
blackberries and drops
of tilia tomentosa.

917
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:44,345
Then she told me to have baths
with tender wheat's bran.

918
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:07,976
I keep growing thin
and start sweating at night.

919
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:12,263
So I decide to go to a centre
of Chinese medicine.

after the CAT.

My doctor friend

994
01:33:00,786 --> 01:33:03,425
to whom I had asked
to be present to the operation,

995
01:33:03,506 --> 01:33:07,419
later told me that the surgeon,
looking in a slide

996
01:33:07,866 --> 01:33:11,415
and watching a bit of the stuff
he had just removed from my lungs, said:

997
01:33:12,306 --> 01:33:16,015
..."I bet a testicle that this is
Hodgkin's lymphoma."

998
01:33:16,626 --> 01:33:18,423
"Not both, but a testicle yes".

999
01:33:19,106 --> 01:33:22,735
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a tumour
to the lymphatic system,

1000
01:33:23,626 --> 01:33:25,503
a curable tumour.

1001
01:33:26,786 --> 01:33:33,513
Then, one day, at home, I skim through
"The Garzanti Medical Encyclopaedia",

1002
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:36,180
and checking "lymphoma", I read:

1003
01:33:37,346 --> 01:33:41,817
...symptoms are: itch,
loss of weight, perspiration.

1004
01:33:43,026 --> 01:33:50,159
However I learned something
from this story, maybe two.

1005
01:33:50,746 --> 01:33:58,388
The first is that physicians know
how to speak but they don't know how to listen..

1006
01:33:58,588 --> 01:34:07,551
...and now I am surrounded by all
the useless medicine that I have bought.

1007
01:34:08,346 --> 01:34:12,976
The second thing that I have learned
is that in the morning,

1008
01:34:13,706 --> 01:34:18,184
before breakfast, to drink
a glass of water is a good thing.

1009
01:34:18,306 --> 01:34:22,219
I was told it's good for the kidneys,
or for something else.

1010
01:34:22,506 --> 01:34:24,019
In short, it's good.

1011
01:34:26,066 --> 01:34:30,585
