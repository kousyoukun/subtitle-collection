3
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:53,013
 I've been searching
for a long time 

4
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:57,936
 To find someone to be mine 

5
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:03,273
 I never thought
you'd come along 

6
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,944
 Now that you're here,
all my worries are gone 

7
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:08,946
 Oh 

8
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:13,741
 Sweet you 

9
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,121
 All of my dreams
have all come true 

10
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:27,921
 You're just the one
I've been looking for 

11
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,467
 I didn't know
how long it would take 

12
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:37,096
 But good things
come to those who wait 

13
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:41,976
 Now I can't ask
for anything more 

14
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:47,314
 You're everything
I've been looking for 

15
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,985
 Sweet you 

16
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:56,698
 Nobody, nobody,
nobody will ever do 

17
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:06,081
 You're just the one
I've been looking for 

18
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,667
 Nights were dark 

19
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,170
 Days got longer 

20
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:15,298
 My mind was weak,
but my heart stayed strong 

21
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:19,802
 Then you came along
and rescued me 

22
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,558
 Please, don't ever set me free 

23
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:27,643
 Oh, no 

24
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:35,026
 Oh 

25
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:39,780
 Sweet you 

26
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:44,535
 Nobody, nobody,
nobody will ever do 

27
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:54,211
 You're just the one
I've been looking for 

28
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,630
 Nights were dark 

29
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:59,132
 Days got longer 

30
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,637
 My mind was weak,
but my heart stayed strong 

31
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:07,890
 Then you came along
and rescued me 

32
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:12,603
 Please, don't ever set me free 

33
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:15,814
 Oh, no 

34
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,112
 Oh 

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,322
 Sweet you... 

36
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,824
Synedyne Technical Support.
This is Suzanne. How can I help you?

37
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:29,953
Synedyne Technical Support.
This is Rachel. How can I help you?

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,163
This is Elliot.
How can I help you?

39
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:35,916
Oh, wow.

40
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,877
Yeah, okay.
Give me a second to find you here.

41
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:41,171
My computer's running
a little slow today.

42
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,632
Wake up, fella.
There you are.

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,008
Hey, you got yourself
a model 5732.

44
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,594
128 megs of RAM,
27 gig hard drive.

45
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,181
Good. Good. And you say that
it hangs every time you print?

46
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,725
Wow!
All right, no problem.

47
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,435
Can you hold for two seconds?

48
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,312
Carol! Carol.

49
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,691
I don't know what
you've been told, little lady,

50
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:05,110
but the rest of us start at nine.

51
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,197
Kidding, I'm just kidding.
Good morning.

52
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,991
Hey, Dan, my man!
What's up, my bro?

53
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,244
Yeah, put it there!
All right. Yeah.

54
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:18,497
So hoops today? You and the guys
up for some hoopage after work?

55
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,083
Uh, you know,
we don't know yet, Elliot.

56
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,793
- I'm not sure yet, okay?
- That's cool. Just let me know.

57
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,296
'Cause I'm there, bud. That's right,
'cause I love the round ball.

58
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:29,091
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."

59
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,803
- Yeah!
- Okay.

60
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,264
Make sure that you
let me know the right time

61
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,806
because last week you said 6:30

62
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:38,641
and when I got there,
you guys were just leaving.

63
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,102
I mean, how stupid did you feel?

64
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,313
Pretty stupid, Elliot.

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,648
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.

66
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,984
- Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

67
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:49,735
Good, good.
How you doing, man?

68
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,823
Hey, Bob!

69
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,992
- What's up?
- Hey, Elliot.

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,037
You and your posse
gonna hit the brewery tonight?

71
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,288
My "posse"?
No.

72
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:05,708
Uh, they're all busy with the big...

73
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,835
- What's with your neck?
- Oh, nothing.

74
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:11,672
It's a repetitive stress disorder.
It's a headset injury.

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,090
So what do you say you and me
go and knock back some suds

76
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,508
and check out the babes?

77
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:18,094
Elliot, I'm married, remember?

78
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm gonna go home,
spend some time with my wife.

79
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,015
Oh.

80
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:25,435
Taking a trip to Whipville.

81
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,731
It just gets funnier
every time you do that.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,568
Don't, don't, don't...

83
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:36,028
Hey, Jerry!

84
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:39,281
Jerry, Jerry, bo-berry,
fee-fi-fo-ferry, Jerry!

85
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,865
Hey, what's happening, brother?

86
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,867
- Running to an important meeting.
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:44,035
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait.

88
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,787
No, I think you're gonna
appreciate this,

89
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,705
because we're both a couple
of stereo component nuts.

90
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,749
Check these out, holmes.
These are the new Ingebritzens.

91
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,125
- Right.
- XVC speakers.

92
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:53,293
Here, look it.
That's the back of the left speaker

93
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,170
and the front of the right speaker.

94
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,671
Sweet, sweet, sweet.

95
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,965
That's the front of the left...
no, that's the right...

96
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,890
I think... oh, man!

97
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,892
- What?
- It's Elliot.

98
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,310
Who told him we were here?

99
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,021
- Oh, shit.
- Did you tell him we were here?

100
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,569
Hi!

101
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:24,198
You guys!

102
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,908
I told you not to...

103
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,286
Well, well, well,
isn't this a big surprise?

104
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,079
I thought everybody was busy.

105
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:32,956
A slight change of plans, Elliot.

106
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:35,208
Oh, is that right?

107
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,293
Well, I'm a little bit peeved
at you guys.

108
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:40,713
I'm thinking you tried to ditch me.
I might not even sit down with you.

109
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,174
We can certainly understand that,
so we'll see you tomorrow.

110
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:46,051
- Later, Elliot.
- I'm kidding!

111
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,845
- Switch places with me.
- No, I'm fine.

112
00:06:57,604 --> 00:06:59,564
- What?
- Oh, my goodness gracious.

113
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,065
You've gotta be kidding!

114
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,943
Please, please, don't tell me

115
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,611
that you have a thing for Alison
Gardner.

116
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,904
- Oh, man!
- Please.

117
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,115
She's way out of your league.

118
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,908
Isn't she dating that guy in research?

119
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,326
Brian, with the teeth.

120
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,287
Brian?
The guy with the teeth.

121
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:16,789
No, that's been over
for three months now.

122
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:21,335
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- I know a lot of things about her.

123
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,045
I know that she likes her bagels
buttered, but not toasted.

124
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:26,006
- Wow.
- How specific.

125
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,758
I know that she looks beautiful
in any color,

126
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,803
but when she wears blue...

127
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:35,473
Sounds like you guys
are old friends?

128
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,932
Well, we have been
working together

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,310
at the same company
for four years.

130
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:41,645
You spend time together,
people get to know each other.

131
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,647
It's true,
so it should be no problem

132
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:45,941
for you to just get up,
walk over there, and say hello.

133
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:48,276
She's with somebody.
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.

134
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,570
- Come on!
- Hold on, Elliot.

135
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,946
Come clean here.

136
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:55,200
You have never spoken
to Alison Gardner, right?

137
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,493
Of course I have.

138
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,288
- Did I say "queer" earlier?
- You are pathetic, Elliot! Really.

139
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:04,209
Okay, I guess you guys are just
not gonna let me relax tonight

140
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:05,668
until I go over there and say hello.

141
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:06,920
- I guess not.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,507
Well, if that'll make you happy.
You think I'm pathetic.

143
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,968
- Don't touch me.
- Go for it, tiger.

144
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,178
Good luck.

145
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:27,563
- Hi.
- Hi.

146
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:28,814
Do I know you?

147
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,234
Oh, I should hope so.

148
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:34,695
We've only been working together
at Synedyne for the last four years.

149
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:37,698
I'm Elliot Richards.

150
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,032
We've spoken.

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,660
I'm sorry, I don't...

152
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:44,704
It was the first week of June,
three years ago.

153
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,290
I said it was wet out.

154
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,710
We were standing in the lobby,
and I said it was really wet out.

155
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,045
It was raining at the time.

156
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:54,713
I assume that.

157
00:08:56,258 --> 00:08:57,258
Yeah.

158
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:04,222
So here we are, talking again.

159
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,640
Yeah.

160
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,769
Well, take it easy.

161
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:19,194
I'm here with friends
and I was wondering if you wanted...

162
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:38,212
Dear God, I would give anything
to have that girl in my life.

163
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,713
- Hi.
- Hello.

164
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,298
I was wondering...

165
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,175
if this is...

166
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:31,971
I was standing over there and...

167
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,224
You're very glib.
I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.

168
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,477
- Well...
- You here alone?

169
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,020
No!

170
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,356
I'm here with
some buddies from work.

171
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,567
I saw you talking to a woman.

172
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:48,819
Yeah, but I'm not with her.

173
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:51,489
But you'd like to be, huh?

174
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,407
What makes you say that?

175
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,825
I don't know.

176
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,661
When a man says
he'd give anything

177
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,329
to have a certain woman in his life,

178
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,288
I just assume
she means something to him.

179
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:02,123
How did you hear me say that?

180
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,001
- I was standing way over...
- I have fantastic hearing.

181
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:08,254
And a number of other
equally impressive talents.

182
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,512
Ho-doggie!

183
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:21,058
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk.

184
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:27,146
Okay... what?
You want to talk to me?

185
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:28,940
Is there a problem?

186
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:31,359
Are you not attracted to me?

187
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,694
No.

188
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,365
I think you're hot.

189
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,075
Baby, you have no idea.

190
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,502
- Kiss me.
- What? Here?

191
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,380
Don't be afraid
to explore new horizons.

192
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,548
Oh.

193
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:03,473
Can you give us
two seconds, girls?

194
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,143
Yeah, can you give us two seconds?

195
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,561
Sure.

196
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:08,895
Whatever.

197
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,400
Listen...

198
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,403
you seem really nice,

199
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,613
in a strong,

200
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,532
scary kind of a way,

201
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,909
but my friends
are probably waiting for me,

202
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,912
so I'm gonna just get going.

203
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,456
You're so nervous, Elliot.

204
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,249
How do you know my name?

205
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,959
I'm psychic.

206
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,627
Plus, it's on your name tag.

207
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,714
Duh.

208
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,050
Now then, I just want
to talk business for a second.

209
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,262
Oh, I'm not into that.

210
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,098
I mean, I've never paid
for sex before.

211
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,851
Except this one time...
there was an Internet thing.

212
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,771
I mean, you can't help it. Every time
you sign on, it's "sex, sex, sex."

213
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,564
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just want to ask you a question.

214
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:59,984
How would you like to make
one simple decision

215
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:02,528
that'll change your life forever?

216
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:06,741
Okay, I'm glad Scientology
works for you, but...

217
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:08,617
Just listen.

218
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,787
What if I told you that
I have the cataclysmic power

219
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:15,707
to give you anything and everything
you've always dreamed of?

220
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:18,460
Who are you?

221
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:21,295
Promise not to tell anyone?

222
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:22,506
Okay.

223
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,509
Cross your heart and hope to die?

224
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:27,969
Yeah.

225
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,557
I'm the devil.

226
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,145
Okay.

227
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:41,565
I think somebody's had
"tee many martoonis"!

228
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,735
I am the devil.
Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub.

229
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:45,944
The Prince of Darkness.

230
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,322
Well, the Princess of Darkness,
anyway.

231
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,657
Here's my card.

232
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:52,075
Oh.

233
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,161
"The devil." Yep.

234
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,622
That explains it.

235
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,164
Now I believe you.

236
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,000
Night-night.

237
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:08,173
You're a very skeptical person,
you know that?

238
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:09,508
How did...

239
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,759
How did you just...
and you...

240
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,514
Look. If you could just buy into
this "I'm the devil" thing,

241
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,808
it'll save us both
a lot of these questions.

242
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:21,185
Maybe I should call you a cab.

243
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:24,688
Although it's gonna be hard to find one
that'll go to hell this time of night.

244
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:27,482
Oh! What a delightfully piquant wit.

245
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,610
I can see we're gonna
get along famously.

246
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:32,612
Cheers, darling.

247
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:38,033
Are you... you can't...
look at... jeez!

248
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:42,997
You can't do that.
That's very dangerous!

249
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:45,875
Why is this so hard
for you to believe?

250
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:49,211
Do you think your mommy and daddy
just made me up so you'd be good?

251
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:52,714
Okay, okay. You're the devil.
What do you want with me?

252
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:56,134
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.

253
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,678
All you need is a little push
in the right direction.

254
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,179
I am happy!

255
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:03,223
Oh, please!
You don't have to lie to me.

256
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:06,560
I know every dark thought
in your tiny little mind.

257
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:09,939
I know that every night you go home
to your horrible little apartment

258
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:13,401
and you eat your little frozen dinner,
and you make your little bowl of popcorn

259
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,404
and watch TV until you can't keep
your eyes open anymore.

260
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:19,781
And then you crawl off to bed

261
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,577
and wonder why you're alone
and nobody likes you.

262
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:26,622
Not every night.

263
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:28,581
And you cry.

264
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah, sure.

265
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:37,757
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.

266
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:39,800
You could cry right now.

267
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,767
I'm talking about reinvention,
taking control of your destiny.

268
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:50,852
You want to be liked?

269
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,604
You want to be loved?

270
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,688
How about respected?

271
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,232
How about feared?

272
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,738
What exactly are we talking about?

273
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:05,199
You want to see how it works, baby?

274
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,699
Wish for something.

275
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,285
- Like what?
- Whatever you want, it's yours.

276
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:11,287
Just say the word.

277
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,790
Okay,

278
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,585
I wish I had a Big Mac
and a large Coke.

279
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:19,711
It is done.

280
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,303
Hi, how you doing?
What can I get you?

281
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,305
A Big Mac and a large Coke.

282
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,598
Fries?

283
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,724
No.

284
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,685
Comes to $3.47.

285
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,647
Do you have $3.47?

286
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:41,942
I left my purse in the underworld.

287
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,487
Oh, yes!
This truly is the work of the devil!

288
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,657
And to think that I doubted you!
I'm gonna go now.

289
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,659
What's the problem?

290
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:54,161
This doesn't prove anything!

291
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,332
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.

292
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:01,085
No such thing as a free lunch.
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

293
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,712
I didn't even get any fries.

294
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,588
Oh, I don't believe this.

295
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,674
I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime

296
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,593
and all you can do is moan
about French fries?

297
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,803
- Good night.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

298
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:15,348
I'm obviously not getting through
to you, so let's just forget it.

299
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,268
Come on, I'll give you
a lift back to your car.

300
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,272
That's your car?

301
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,978
- It's him!
- It's Elliot!

302
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,569
Elliot, right here.

303
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,528
I love you, Elliot!

304
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,656
Where are we?

305
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,451
Just a little after-hours club I own.

306
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:24,746
We'd better get in there.
Everyone's waiting for you.

307
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:26,081
Everyone who?

308
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:27,706
All your friends.

309
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,584
How you doing, Mr. Richards?

310
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:32,711
Elliot, one picture!

311
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,526
- Hey! Hey, Elliot!
- No way! This is your club?

312
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:57,693
It sure is.

313
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:03,032
Wow.

314
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,575
Yeah, baby!

315
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,620
- Hello, Elliot.
- Hello.

316
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:11,039
- Elliot, dance with me.
- No, dance with me.

317
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,208
No, he's gonna dance with me first.

318
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:16,128
Okay, girls, that's enough.
Break it up. He belongs to me.

319
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:19,130
How the hell are you?
Somebody take a picture of us.

320
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,715
- Hold it!
- Excellent.

321
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,801
Hi, Elliot.

322
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:29,932
I think she likes you, too.

323
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,517
- Are you hungry?
- Uh-huh. Sort of.

324
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:33,977
- Look.
- Wow!

325
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,521
These look just like the cookies
my grandma used to make.

326
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,273
- Try one.
- Okay.

327
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,651
These are the cookies
that my grandma used to make!

328
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,278
I aim to please, handsome.
Come on.

329
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,779
How did you...

330
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:50,659
- You liked that, didn't you?
- What, the cookie?

331
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:54,496
Having all those people
excited to see you.

332
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,664
It's nice to feel accepted, isn't it?

333
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,791
I can give you that.

334
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,711
I can make the whole world
love you.

335
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,672
- Come on!
- You still don't believe me, do you?

336
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,632
Of course not!

337
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,343
First of all,
you look nothing like the devil.

338
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,680
Oh, really? I suppose I could
have gone this way.

339
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,311
But it's so trick-or-treat.

340
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,188
It's true!

341
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,105
You really are the devil!

342
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:25,191
Oh, come on, baby.

343
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,775
Come and sit down.

344
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:30,154
I know this has all been
horribly overwhelming for you.

345
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,908
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure, you can.

346
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,701
You can ask me anything you'd like.

347
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,243
As long as you don't ask me
if there's a God.

348
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:40,122
I get that one all the time.
It drives me absolutely bonkers.

349
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,584
Yes, there's a God.

350
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:46,337
Really?
Well, what's He like?

351
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:49,756
You'd think meeting the devil
would be interesting enough,

352
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:52,383
but all they want
to know about is Him!

353
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,385
Like He's so bloody fascinating.

354
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,179
- So He's a man?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:59,557
Most men think they're God.
This one just happens to be right.

356
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,477
Now listen, darling.
I don't want to pressure you,

357
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,521
but why don't we take
a teensy little look at the contract?

358
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:14,238
What the...
it's pretty...

359
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:21,578
"I, Elliot Richards,
hereafter known as 'the Damned'...

360
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,748
- "the Damned"?
- How about "the Darned"? Better?

361
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,333
Don't get hung up
on the language, darling.

362
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:31,379
There's nothing sinister here.
It's all standard boilerplate.

363
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:34,423
Paragraph one
states that "I, the devil,

364
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:38,302
a nonprofit corporation with offices
in purgatory, hell, and L.A.,

365
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,304
will give you seven wishes
to use as you see fit."

366
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:44,724
Seven?
Why not eight?

367
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:48,436
Why not six? I don't know.
Seven just sounds right.

368
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:52,773
Paragraph two outlines the manner
in which you'll pay for the wishes.

369
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,234
What? Are you kidding?!
I have to give you my soul?

370
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,111
After you've had your wishes,
of course.

371
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,780
But it's my soul!

372
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,865
I can't give you my soul!

373
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,617
What are you?
James Brown?

374
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,119
What's the big deal?
Have you ever seen your soul?

375
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:09,956
- Do you even know what it is?
- Of course, it's the thing that...

376
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,626
No, that's...
it floats around...

377
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:16,087
Can I tell you something?

378
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:20,049
Souls are overrated.
They don't really do anything.

379
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,343
Has yours done anything
for you so far?

380
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:25,013
No, it's like your appendix.

381
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,472
You'll never even miss it.

382
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,934
Well, if it's so useless,
then why do you want it so much?

383
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:32,311
Ooh, aren't you the clever one?

384
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:36,231
Look, who's really making out
in this deal here?

385
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,359
Seven utterly fabulous wishes

386
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:41,111
for one piddling little soul?

387
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,070
Well, I don't know.

388
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,614
What have we here?

389
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,996
Wait. Who is...

390
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,539
Alison?

391
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,374
How did you...

392
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,211
She is so beautiful.

393
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,673
- I've waited for you for so long.
- Who's that?

394
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,717
- I've waited for you for so long.
- Who's she with?

395
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,303
- I want you now, my love.
- Why are you showing me this?

396
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:13,682
Oh, I love your hair like that.

397
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,560
You must go through
conditioner like crazy.

398
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,521
Is this real?

399
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:23,316
It could be.
All you have to do is sign.

400
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,318
And you promise I'll get her?

401
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,570
That's really up to you.
You're the one with the wishes.

402
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:32,200
But I promise I'll do
everything in my power.

403
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,910
Sign it, Elliot.

404
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:47,129
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting, Elliot.

405
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,072
Great!

406
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,450
Now before you start wishing,
you'll be needing this.

407
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:20,412
If for any reason your wish
isn't going the way you hoped,

408
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,581
just take out the pager, hit 666,

409
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,208
and it'll bring you
right back to me.

410
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:29,670
Why wouldn't it go the way
that I'd hoped?

411
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:32,381
I was just throwing that out
as a for instance.

412
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:36,009
Every wish is gonna be
100 percent fabulous.

413
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:39,804
But you'll find that out
as soon as you make one.

414
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:43,641
- So I should make one now?
- Well, if you don't mind.

415
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:45,435
I've got places to go,

416
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:49,272
people to condemn to
an eternity of fiery torment.

417
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,898
Okay, let me think.

418
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:56,570
- I... I want to be married to Alison.
- You got it.

419
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,447
That's not all.
I want to be rich.

420
00:24:58,614 --> 00:25:00,198
Always a popular choice.

421
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,575
That's not all.

422
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:05,536
I want to be very rich
and very powerful.

423
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,415
Ooh, even better.
Remember, you have to say, "I wish."

424
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,292
Right.

425
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,628
I wish that I were
married to Alison

426
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,338
and that I were very, very rich
and very powerful.

427
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:19,966
- How's that sound?
- Sounds good to me.

428
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:21,926
Enjoy.

429
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,274
Roberto.

430
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:07,527
"I am is to visiting
in the Los Angeles

431
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:10,821
for the time of vacations."

432
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,031
"Idioto"!

433
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:07,682
Alejandro?

434
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,517
Roberto? Esteban?

435
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,942
Mama!

436
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:35,264
Seis, seis, seis!

437
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,274
Back so soon?

438
00:36:50,571 --> 00:36:53,198
You turned me into a drug dealer!

439
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:54,783
They almost killed me!

440
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:56,660
You asked for rich and powerful.

441
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:59,371
- Not like that.
- Goes with the territory, babe.

442
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:02,289
"Root of all evil."
Ring any bells?

443
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:05,084
But what about Alison?
What got into her?

444
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,128
I think it was Raoul.

445
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:09,296
Yeah!
That's not what I wished for.

446
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:11,590
Well, hold on now, mister.

447
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:13,800
You wished that
the two of you were married.

448
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:16,136
You didn't say anything
about her loving you.

449
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:19,139
You know, when two people
get married, I assume that...

450
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:21,141
There's your mistake.

451
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:24,144
- May I suggest something?
- What?

452
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:26,478
The rich and powerful thing
wasn't really the way to go.

453
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:29,731
Everyone wishes for that first thing
out of the gate and it never pans out.

454
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,025
- Really?
- The fact of the matter is

455
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:35,362
women aren't really attracted
to wealth and power.

456
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,073
- They're not?
- No, of course not.

457
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,867
They couldn't give
a fig for all that rubbish.

458
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:43,995
What you need to figure out
is what she does want in a man.

459
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:45,997
How do I find that out?

460
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:47,582
Easy.

461
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:58,800
I'm not with her!

462
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:03,513
Where are we?

463
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,890
A place you never
would have seen without my help.

464
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:07,892
Welcome... Alison's bedroom.

465
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,687
We can't be in here.
This is breaking and entering.

466
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,689
I know.
It's fun, isn't it?

467
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:16,983
I'm sure we're gonna find the answer
somewhere around here.

468
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:19,904
What if Alison catches us?

469
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,364
Don't worry.
She won't be able to see you.

470
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:23,782
Besides,

471
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,868
she's in the shower.

472
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,036
Naked.

473
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,204
Right behind that door.

474
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,830
Go on, go ahead.
Take a peep.

475
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,081
No!

476
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,375
Oh, come on.
We both know you want to.

477
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:36,961
You must think that
I'm really perverted, don't you?

478
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:38,129
That's what you think.

479
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:40,590
You think I'm some sad,
desperate, twisted, pathetic loser.

480
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:41,758
Yes.

481
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:44,134
Well, in that case,
maybe I'll just take a quick look.

482
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:45,552
Focus, Elliot.

483
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,889
Remember, we're here to find out
what kind of man she wants.

484
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,182
How are we gonna do that?

485
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,935
Well, she keeps a journal.

486
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:55,603
And here it is!

487
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:58,898
Right, I should be able to find some
information in here that's useful.

488
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,691
Hey, that's private stuff.

489
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,568
Is it ever!
Listen to this.

490
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:05,905
"Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.

491
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:09,908
I never did find out any of the guys'
names, but I brought them here

492
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:12,953
and all five banged me
like a Salvation Army drum."

493
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
What?

494
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:15,747
- Give me that!
- Just kidding.

495
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:17,123
I could have been a writer.

496
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,714
Hey, it's okay. She could bump
into you and she wouldn't feel it.

497
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:29,009
Now this is good.

498
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:33,347
"I meet many
attractive men who are interested in me

499
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:35,431
and, while many of them
are handsome

500
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,433
or clever or very successful,

501
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,395
I find myself turning away
from them

502
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:44,691
and searching the horizon
for someone else.

503
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,317
I don't know who he is
or where I'll find him.

504
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:51,697
I only know
that he is a sensitive man.

505
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:54,951
He's a man who's in touch
with his emotions.

506
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,413
He's a man who's not afraid
to share his fears,

507
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,123
his disappointments, and his tears.

508
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,667
'Where are you,
my sensitive man?"'

509
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,346
Did you see that?

510
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,307
She passed right through me.

511
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:20,600
We were one person
for a split second.

512
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:22,477
Just like in "Ghost"!

513
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:24,812
Darling, I've got an earthquake
in eight minutes.

514
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,605
Any chance of making a wish here?

515
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:28,357
Yes.

516
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:32,528
I wish I were the most sensitive
man in the world.

517
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,613
Right. Okay.

518
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:35,781
Wait!

519
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:39,784
I wish I were the most emotionally
sensitive man in the world.

520
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:41,995
Damn, I was hoping
you wouldn't catch that.

521
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:44,164
I could have had a lot of fun.

522
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:45,874
And I want her to love me.

523
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,792
Oh... you know what?

524
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,169
I have a great feeling about this.

525
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:52,338
- You do?
- Yeah, but...

526
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:53,672
what do I know?

527
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:07,769
- Hey.
- I'm back, my love.

528
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:09,145
Where did you run off to?

529
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,022
I went to make a garland
of beach plums

530
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,484
to place atop your glorious head
like a crown.

531
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,570
But then I caught sight
of that sunset and...

532
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:20,238
I don't know.

533
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:23,533
Something stirred inside me
and I had to stop

534
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,327
and weep.

535
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:28,537
It's beautiful.

536
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:30,164
Yeah, it is.

537
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:34,418
There I go again.

538
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:36,837
- Tissue?
- No.

539
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,216
I never wipe my tears away.
I'm not ashamed of them.

540
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:42,050
I wear them proudly.

541
00:41:42,218 --> 00:41:45,762
Like small, wet, salty
badges of emotional truth.

542
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,974
Elliot, there's something that
I think we should talk about.

543
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:55,063
We've been together for, what,
about three weeks now?

544
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:56,272
Three magical weeks.

545
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,775
Three magical weeks.

546
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:01,319
I don't think that I've ever met

547
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:02,904
a man who's been more in touch

548
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:04,948
- with his feelings.
- I love you.

549
00:42:05,116 --> 00:42:06,908
So very much.

550
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,243
I love you, too.

551
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,916
Dudley! Peter!

552
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:18,961
I'm sorry, they're such little devils.

553
00:42:19,129 --> 00:42:21,295
Come on, you naughty boys.
See you.

554
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:27,009
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

555
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,887
Do you need comforting
on any level?

556
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:31,431
No, no, I'm fine.

557
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:33,432
Have I done or said anything

558
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,101
to make you feel
less good about you?

559
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:37,769
No, no, I'm fine.

560
00:42:37,937 --> 00:42:39,438
Would you like something to eat?

561
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,440
I made a Salade Nicoise

562
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:43,942
with dolphin-safe tuna.

563
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,277
Oh, wow.

564
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:54,243
What is it?

565
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:55,828
It's that sunset again.

566
00:42:55,996 --> 00:42:58,580
And I worry about the dolphins.

567
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:00,957
I wrote a song about them.
Would you like to hear it?

568
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,959
Now? I...

569
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,012
 Swimming by the sandy shore 

570
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,265
 Dancing up among the waves 

571
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,726
 Dolphin, dolphin, I adore 

572
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:23,395
 Everything you are 

573
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:26,314
 You're so much more
than a fish to me 

574
00:43:26,482 --> 00:43:29,358
 My playful friend
beneath the sea. 

575
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:35,698
- I have to stop.
- Good. I mean, oh, why?

576
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,407
Because I'm looking at you

577
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:39,701
and I'm seeing
all the beauty of the world

578
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:41,662
shining at me through your eyes.

579
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,331
Would you mind if I sketched you?

580
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,625
I didn't know you could draw.

581
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,835
I'm not an artist per se.

582
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:51,004
Okay, Elliot, there's something
that I think I really have to say.

583
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:56,009
Elliot, that's amazing!

584
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:59,346
Compared to you,
it's nothing.

585
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,848
Compared to your smile

586
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:03,349
and the blush of your cheek

587
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:06,644
and the sound of your voice
as it floats on the evening breeze.

588
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,939
Compared to you,
that sunset's just...

589
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,693
when is that darn thing gonna set?

590
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,695
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait!

591
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,156
There's so much
that I want to say to you,

592
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,367
but I just can't find the words.

593
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,410
I have an idea.

594
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,330
I would like to improvise
a sonnet about your hair.

595
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:33,377
How wonderful
my fair one's face...

596
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,467
Excuse me, fellas.

597
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,052
Might I ask you to take the horseplay

598
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,887
down to another part of the beach?

599
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,806
Eh... no.

600
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:55,231
You know,
rather than get confrontational,

601
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:57,567
why don't we all
just sit down together,

602
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,610
have some salad
with dolphin-safe tuna

603
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:02,321
and see if we can't start a dialogue.

604
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:06,199
You know, I had a feeling
that you were gonna...

605
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:08,827
Okay, guys.

606
00:45:08,995 --> 00:45:11,246
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you

607
00:45:11,414 --> 00:45:13,915
to respect the moment
that my woman friend

608
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,918
and I are sharing,
because it's a special celebration

609
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:18,919
of love and caring

610
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:22,590
and a unique spiritual
and emotional understanding.

611
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:25,801
Do you want to get a beer?

612
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:27,512
Sure.

613
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,765
Alison, excuse me, but I thought that
this was our time together.

614
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:32,641
It's just a beer.
I'll be back in two seconds.

615
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,935
Actually, my place is, like,
40 minutes from here.

616
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,478
That's fine.
Which way's your car?

617
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:38,939
- It's a van.
- Great.

618
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,484
Alison! I respect your uniqueness
and your individuality

619
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:44,320
and you're your own person.

620
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:46,487
If you want to go
with our new friends here

621
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:48,615
to get a drink,
I won't stand in your way.

622
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:50,950
Thanks, Elliot.
I knew you'd understand.

623
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:52,619
No, wait!
Don't go! Don't go!

624
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:55,538
I can't handle this kind of rejection.
Why don't you want to stay?

625
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:57,331
You want to know why, Elliot?

626
00:45:57,498 --> 00:45:59,750
Because you're just too sensitive!

627
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,251
I'm about to go out of my mind!

628
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:04,463
It's been wonderful,
and God knows I love you,

629
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:06,590
but enough is enough!

630
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:08,050
I just want to be with a man

631
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,217
who'll ignore me
and take me for granted,

632
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:12,094
who's only pretending
to be interested

633
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:13,929
in who I am and what I think

634
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:15,640
so he can get into my pants.

635
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,516
That would be me.

636
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:19,435
Oh, thank you!

637
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:22,146
Let's get out of here.

638
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:24,189
Alison? Wait!

639
00:46:24,357 --> 00:46:26,858
Alison!

640
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:29,527
I'll get into your pants!

641
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:50,254
Oh, Elliot, get out of there,
you silly boy.

642
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:53,091
Man, you are so bad!

643
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:54,384
Why, thank you.

644
00:46:54,551 --> 00:46:55,551
Just admit it.

645
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:58,346
You're not very good at this whole
instant-travel thing, are you?

646
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:01,223
I'm sorry. Now then,
what were we talking about?

647
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:02,974
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it?

648
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:04,851
Don't think I don't see
what you're doing.

649
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:08,647
I make wishes, and you think up
ways to ruin them!

650
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:10,691
I ruin them?

651
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:13,026
How can you say that?

652
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:16,613
I'm not perfect, you know!
Do you think I enjoy this?

653
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:20,367
I'm stuck in this
horrible job for eternity,

654
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:22,494
everybody hates me,
I can't sleep,

655
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:24,162
and when I actually try to help someone,

656
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,831
they turn on me like
I'm supposed to be

657
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:28,249
God or something!

658
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,585
For your information,
my life is a living hell!

659
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:35,089
I work hard!
I try to look good for you!

660
00:47:35,257 --> 00:47:38,634
You do look good.
You look very good.

661
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:41,386
I just wanted you to like me!

662
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:43,179
I do like you.

663
00:47:43,347 --> 00:47:45,181
It's just I'm feeling
a little frustrated here.

664
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:48,601
Don't give up on me, Elliot.
I'm not giving up on you.

665
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:50,645
Nobody gets it totally right
right away.

666
00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:53,147
You're doing great. Really.

667
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:56,442
- I am?
- Yeah. You are.

668
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,111
I'm so sorry your wish
didn't work out.

669
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:02,781
Friends?

670
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,700
Sure.

671
00:48:04,868 --> 00:48:08,661
I'm sorry if I said anything
to upset you or make you feel bad.

672
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,539
And I'm gonna try to be
more sensitive next time.

673
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:13,458
Oh, I think you're
sensitive enough already.

674
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,460
- You think?
- Are you kidding?

675
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:16,919
You even went for me crying.

676
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:19,463
Hey! Were you faking me out?
Because...

677
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,506
I was 100% sincere.

678
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:24,426
It's not easy being
the Barbra Streisand of evil, you know.

679
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:28,472
What have we learned so far?

680
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,640
Well, let's see.

681
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,142
I'm starting to think women
really don't know what they want.

682
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,351
Amen!

683
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:37,021
They say they want sensitivity,
but you saw how fast she went

684
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:39,106
for those tough dudes on the beach?

685
00:48:39,274 --> 00:48:40,691
Which tells you?

686
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,485
That...

687
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:45,153
well, it tells me that I want to be
really big and strong.

688
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:47,864
I want to have a great body.
Tall and, like,

689
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:50,492
Good. Go on.

690
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:52,035
- I want to be athletic.
- Check.

691
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:53,828
And I want to be rich, too.

692
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:57,664
For something that I like doing
and that people really like me for.

693
00:48:57,832 --> 00:48:59,666
Great! This is getting
really specific.

694
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,670
Let's see...
big, strong, rich, athletic,

695
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:06,007
something you like,
lots of fans...

696
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:07,759
are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

697
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:09,218
Oh, I hope so.

698
00:49:09,385 --> 00:49:10,594
In the form of a wish?

699
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,596
I wish I could play
professional basketball!

700
00:49:12,764 --> 00:49:15,892
Then I'll just say the magic words:
Dennis Rodman!

701
00:49:18,312 --> 00:49:20,271
- No!
- Just kidding!

702
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:21,939
Michael Jordan.

703
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:24,525
Yeah!

704
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:29,947
Three... two... one...

705
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:37,912
The fans are going nuts here
at the Forum in Los Angeles.

706
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,373
The score, 135 to 85.

707
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,208
Elliot Richards
has totally dominated.

708
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:44,085
If you're just tuning in,
it's a shame

709
00:49:44,253 --> 00:49:46,295
because you've missed
one of the greatest performances

710
00:49:46,463 --> 00:49:47,712
in the history of sports.

711
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,548
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.

712
00:49:49,715 --> 00:49:51,842
People say basketball caught fire

713
00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:53,927
with the ascendry
of Michael Jordan.

714
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:56,972
But after what
we've seen here tonight,

715
00:49:57,139 --> 00:49:59,391
a lot of people are gonna be saying,
"Michael who?"

716
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,100
Right from the get-go,

717
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:03,561
the fans took a look
at Elliot Richards

718
00:50:03,728 --> 00:50:05,145
and a few women fainted

719
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:07,273
and a few fellas,
well, I'd rather not say,

720
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,191
but they liked what they saw.

721
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,111
Absolutely.
He's a big fella and an imposing fella.

722
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:15,446
He's enormous.
He's listed at 7'6" in the program,

723
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:17,991
but I say he plays,
like you said, 11 feet tall.

724
00:50:18,158 --> 00:50:19,868
No, I don't think
he's that big, Jerry.

725
00:50:20,035 --> 00:50:22,871
No, I'm saying the game
he plays is

726
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:25,415
that of some Viking giant

727
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:28,792
with a basketball in one hand
and a club in the other

728
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,961
and standing 10, 11, 12 feet tall!

729
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:33,130
It's obvious that Elliot Richards

730
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:35,924
will control this game
from the tip-off.

731
00:50:36,092 --> 00:50:37,342
Right from the get-go,

732
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,094
Elliot is a dominating force
in tonight's game.

733
00:50:40,262 --> 00:50:43,806
He was "phi-slamma-jamma,"
rubbing stink all over him

734
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,018
with rib-tickling jumps
of double-vanilla funk.

735
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:50,480
Let's take a look.
Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.

736
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,899
For the dunk!
Just a beautiful play.

737
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:57,737
Here he is lining up for the 3,
and, Ricola, it's good.

738
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,406
Here comes his patented,
over-the-shoulder,

739
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:01,949
no-look three-pointer.

740
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:03,743
And nothing but net.

741
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:08,788
They got the rhythm tonight.

742
00:51:08,956 --> 00:51:11,499
They're in the zone.

743
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:13,585
Here he is soaring through the air

744
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:16,296
like a man on a flying trapezius.

745
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:19,882
Bam! That's what I'm talking about!

746
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,301
Destroying the backboard
and the glass!

747
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:24,887
- This kid's an animal.
- Let's take another look.

748
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,055
And boom!

749
00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:28,849
Humpty-hump, dump-dump!

750
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:32,644
I love this game, folks.
I sure enough do!

751
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:35,605
Elliot Richards spitting
glass at your ass!

752
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:38,775
Bob is courtside with
Elliot Richards now. Bob?

753
00:51:38,943 --> 00:51:40,401
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.

754
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:42,736
Elliot, you must be one
very proud young man this evening.

755
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:45,906
Simply put, that was a staggeringly
dramatic display of athletic ability.

756
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:48,617
Well, you know,
you go out there

757
00:51:48,785 --> 00:51:51,244
and you give 110%
and you want to play good.

758
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:54,831
You hope you play good.
I think we played pretty good tonight.

759
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:58,960
In sports terminology... and I
don't mean to sound contrary here...

760
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:02,546
the word "good" falls short
of encompassing the sheer virtuosity

761
00:52:02,714 --> 00:52:05,007
of your performance this evening.

762
00:52:05,175 --> 00:52:08,718
Um, well, you know,
there's no "I" in the word "team"

763
00:52:08,886 --> 00:52:12,222
and this is a team effort,
and I want to say I'm proud

764
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,684
to be associated with
these fine individuals

765
00:52:15,851 --> 00:52:18,144
that I have had
the pleasure of working with.

766
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:21,855
I would never want to dis your
teammates, but you realize that

767
00:52:22,023 --> 00:52:25,818
you smashed Wilt Chamberlain's
record of 100 points in a game

768
00:52:25,986 --> 00:52:28,362
set in Hershey, Pennsylvania,
all those years ago?

769
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:32,157
Oh, man, you just gotta play one game
at a time and give 110%.

770
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:35,828
You gotta show you want it more
than they do when the chips fall.

771
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:38,706
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.

772
00:52:38,873 --> 00:52:41,625
All right!
Diablos!

773
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:43,919
Number one, yeah!

774
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:50,508
Elliot.
Hi.

775
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:52,510
Alison Gardner.

776
00:52:52,678 --> 00:52:54,053
"The Sporting News."

777
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:57,640
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

778
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:00,559
God, I can't tell you how
thrilled I am to meet you.

779
00:53:00,727 --> 00:53:03,186
I was wondering if there
was a possibility

780
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,772
if you might consider doing
something exclusive with me

781
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,441
for the magazine.

782
00:53:07,608 --> 00:53:10,402
You know, maybe more intimate,
one-on-one.

783
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,319
Just the two of us.

784
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:16,574
Yeah, right, I'd kill you one-on-one!

785
00:53:16,742 --> 00:53:19,160
Shoot!

786
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:23,539
God, it's so exciting to be here.
I mean...

787
00:53:23,707 --> 00:53:26,291
you must have an enormously huge

788
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:28,752
talent to do what you do.

789
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,587
Well, you know,

790
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:32,672
you go out there
and you just give 110%.

791
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,674
And...

792
00:53:34,842 --> 00:53:37,469
you hope you play good.
And you want to play good.

793
00:53:37,636 --> 00:53:39,720
I think we played pretty good.

794
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:41,805
God, you were incredible tonight.

795
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:45,809
Watching you... I just kept thinking
how unbelievably big

796
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:49,104
your ego must be
after a game like that.

797
00:53:49,272 --> 00:53:51,397
Well, not that big, really.

798
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:52,940
I bet it's pretty big.

799
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:55,193
Well, it gets a little bit bigger.

800
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:59,156
It depends on how happy I am!

801
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,748
Want to go back to my place?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.

802
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:12,418
Oh, God, that would...
that would be tremendous.

803
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,087
All right! Well...

804
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:16,963
I should...
I should get dressed.

805
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:18,715
I can't wait.

806
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:28,142
Oh, my God!

807
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:34,106
Hey! What the hell?

808
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:36,817
- God, there's this...
- Hey!

809
00:54:36,984 --> 00:54:38,652
Damn!

810
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,278
Oh, heck!

811
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:43,280
Oh, God,
I remembered there's

812
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:45,366
this teeny, tiny thing to do.

813
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:47,409
- What's teeny?
- No, no.

814
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:49,829
- Just something I have to write.
- About me?

815
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,498
Yeah, just a little, short,
itty-bitty blurb

816
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,208
about tonight's game.

817
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:56,501
Well, can I see you
after the road trip?

818
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,337
I would love to,
but I'm working on

819
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,507
a really big, huge,
enormous story on the NFL,

820
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:05,510
so I probably won't have time.

821
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,386
Shoot, I understand.

822
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,514
- You gotta give 110%.
- Right.

823
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,558
- Stay within yourself.
- Hey, go, yeah.

824
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:16,854
Hey, um... thanks for your time.

825
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:19,189
So long.

826
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,357
Oh!

827
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:23,025
What the hell?!

828
00:55:23,193 --> 00:55:25,069
Oh, damn the devil!

829
00:55:25,237 --> 00:55:28,573
Damn the devil to hell!

830
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,366
Shoot! Darn it!

831
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:33,118
Where the heck did I put that?

832
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,793
5-5-5.

833
00:55:43,796 --> 00:55:45,297
7-7-7.

834
00:55:57,475 --> 00:55:59,184
Now what are you doing?

835
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:00,894
You seem so upset, Elliot.

836
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:03,104
Do you want me to give you
something to help you relax?

837
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:04,397
You bet I'm upset.

838
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:06,900
You gave me this little,
teeny-weeny winkie.

839
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:09,153
Well, that's easily fixed, you know.

840
00:56:09,321 --> 00:56:10,696
Now then, let's see.

841
00:56:10,864 --> 00:56:13,823
There's some M&M's for room 320.

842
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:15,742
Red Hots for 316.

843
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,660
You're giving them candy?

844
00:56:17,828 --> 00:56:20,371
Placebos.
They work as well as the real thing.

845
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:21,873
It's a scientific fact.

846
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:24,374
You can't give sick people Tic Tacs.

847
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:26,335
Sick people have
notoriously bad breath.

848
00:56:26,502 --> 00:56:28,962
I'm performing
a public service here.

849
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,923
Now then, about your next wish.

850
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,885
All right, okay.

851
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:36,928
Well...

852
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:38,763
I want to be smart.

853
00:56:38,931 --> 00:56:40,723
No, I want to be really smart.

854
00:56:40,891 --> 00:56:43,768
I want to be able to talk good.
"Well."

855
00:56:43,936 --> 00:56:45,311
What's the word?

856
00:56:45,479 --> 00:56:46,604
Articulate?

857
00:56:46,772 --> 00:56:49,148
Articulate!
Yeah, I want to be articulate.

858
00:56:49,316 --> 00:56:52,275
And I want to be witty
and sophisticated.

859
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:55,487
Charming. I want to know
everything about everything

860
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:57,447
and I want to be popular.

861
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,157
I want to be good-looking.

862
00:56:59,325 --> 00:57:00,533
No, no, make that great-looking!

863
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:04,328
And I want Alison to fall
head over heels in love with me.

864
00:57:04,496 --> 00:57:05,746
Anything else?

865
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,706
Like what?

866
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:09,708
Like winkiewise?

867
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:12,378
Oh, right.

868
00:57:12,545 --> 00:57:15,838
Yeah, well,

869
00:57:16,006 --> 00:57:18,967
I want to be big.

870
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,177
Not like practical-joke big,

871
00:57:21,345 --> 00:57:23,763
but, you know, sort of...

872
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,809
yeah, like that.
Is that clear?

873
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:30,602
Crystal. You just say "I wish"
and I'll fill in the rest.

874
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:35,399
I wish that
I was witty and articulate...

875
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:36,566
Blah, blah, blah.

876
00:57:36,734 --> 00:57:38,777
You got it, smarty-pants.

877
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:42,154
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

878
00:57:59,172 --> 00:58:01,424
Oh! Elliot!

879
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:04,510
Oh, it is so wonderful
to see you, darling!

880
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,682
New York has been
so deadly dull without you.

881
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:11,891
Where have you been?

882
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,644
Out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.

883
00:58:14,812 --> 00:58:16,104
What, another one?

884
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:18,857
You've written four books
in three years.

885
00:58:19,025 --> 00:58:21,650
- What's this one about?
- Oh, same old, same old.

886
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:24,570
A deconstruction of the neoromantic
period in art and literature

887
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:26,196
from the political
and economic perspective

888
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:28,532
of the Industrial Revolution
in France, England, and Germany.

889
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,659
I can't imagine who reads this stuff!

890
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,662
Well, Elliot,
the critics, apparently.

891
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,789
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize

892
00:58:36,957 --> 00:58:38,709
and it hasn't
even been published yet.

893
00:58:38,877 --> 00:58:41,295
Like they say,
Dr. Ngegitigegitibaba,

894
00:58:41,463 --> 00:58:45,298
a Pulitzer Prize
and $3.50 will get you a caffe latte.

895
00:58:45,466 --> 00:58:47,050
So modest.

896
00:58:47,217 --> 00:58:49,052
Darling,
you really should get around.

897
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:51,721
Everyone's dying to see you.
Mingle.

898
00:58:58,061 --> 00:59:00,103
Darling, you look fabulous.
Vassily Mishka?

899
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:02,898
What a charming man.
Who is that?

900
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:04,232
Oh, that's Elliot Richards.

901
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,568
He's a very successful writer.

902
00:59:06,736 --> 00:59:10,404
He's a very successful everything,
as a matter of fact.

903
00:59:10,572 --> 00:59:12,490
That's Elliot Richards?

904
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:15,284
Oh, I've read all his books.
He's brilliant.

905
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:17,244
I had no idea he was so handsome.

906
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:19,413
Why don't you go and talk to him?

907
00:59:19,581 --> 00:59:23,291
- I couldn't. What would I say?
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

908
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,544
Just let him do all the talking.

909
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:28,588
It's a common misapprehension

910
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:30,673
that the word "gin"
comes from the city Geneva.

911
00:59:30,841 --> 00:59:34,844
But the word "geneva," small "g,"
is a corruption of genievre,

912
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,929
which is French for "juniper,"

913
00:59:37,097 --> 00:59:40,224
the wonderful berry that flavors
this miraculous libation.

914
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:44,938
Speaking of miraculous.

915
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:47,357
I'm Elliot Richards.
How do you do?

916
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:49,108
I know who you are.

917
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:51,693
I'm Alison Gardner.

918
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:54,822
I just had to tell you
how much I loved your novel

919
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:56,281
"Always Toujours."

920
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:59,535
Well, I was just trying
to make a simple point, really.

921
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:02,620
Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,

922
01:00:02,788 --> 01:00:04,038
I kept thinking to myself,

923
01:00:04,206 --> 01:00:06,624
"Why does the existential dilemma

924
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:09,794
- have to be so damned bleak?"
- Yes.

925
01:00:09,962 --> 01:00:11,838
Yes, we're alone in the universe.

926
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:14,464
Yes, life is meaningless,
death is inevitable.

927
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:16,633
But is that necessarily
so depressing?

928
01:00:16,801 --> 01:00:19,803
I couldn't agree more.

929
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:22,556
Don't you think
secular humanism is yummy?

930
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:24,307
Oh, delish.

931
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,316
My, my.

932
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:36,986
They say alcohol is a disinhibitor,

933
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:38,821
and it's working very well on me.

934
01:00:38,989 --> 01:00:40,530
Me, too.

935
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:45,535
What an exquisite feeling.

936
01:00:45,703 --> 01:00:48,121
Every cell in my body just...

937
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,790
wants to reach out
and touch someone.

938
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:54,126
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?

939
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,256
The physiology of touch.

940
01:00:59,424 --> 01:01:01,300
Just below your epidermis,

941
01:01:01,468 --> 01:01:05,053
concentrated in your fingertips,

942
01:01:05,221 --> 01:01:08,347
palms of your hands,

943
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:11,142
soles of your feet,

944
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,186
clitoris,

945
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:15,855
nipples, penis,

946
01:01:16,023 --> 01:01:17,064
lips,

947
01:01:17,232 --> 01:01:19,357
tongue.

948
01:01:19,525 --> 01:01:22,736
Thousands of tiny little
Meissner's corpuscles

949
01:01:22,904 --> 01:01:26,448
all deliciously sensitive
to even the slightest caress,

950
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,743
sending all those tiny little
endorphin-producing

951
01:01:29,911 --> 01:01:33,997
pleasure messages
to the hypothalamus...

952
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:37,042
the primitive brain.

953
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,545
I'm tingling all over.

954
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:43,881
Do you know the largest organ
in the human body?

955
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:50,095
- I can guess.
- You'd be wrong.

956
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:52,973
It's your integumentary system.

957
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:57,352
Your creamy,

958
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,896
soft,

959
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:04,526
and completely desirable skin.

960
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:08,154
- Can we go to your place?
- For something more?

961
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:17,412
Oh, this is so perfect!

962
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,374
Everything here
absolutely screams

963
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:23,251
Elliot Richards.

964
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:26,045
Actually, most of the screaming

965
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:28,256
takes place...

966
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:31,592
in the bedroom.

967
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:47,065
What the hell is going on, Mary?

968
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:49,191
- Who are you?
- Don't play games with me,

969
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,110
Mr. Richards.
I'm in no mood.

970
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:54,780
I've been out of my mind all night.

971
01:02:54,948 --> 01:02:57,866
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

972
01:02:58,034 --> 01:02:59,785
Who's your little friend?

973
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:02,203
Maybe I should be running along.

974
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:04,622
Wait. This is a mistake.
I'm not gay.

975
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:08,585
Oh, really?
And I'm Tony Danza.

976
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:10,378
Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.

977
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:11,796
Well, then tell me,

978
01:03:11,964 --> 01:03:14,798
who was in the Broadway cast
of "The Pajama Game"?

979
01:03:14,966 --> 01:03:17,760
Janis Paige, John Raitt,
Eddie Foy, Jr...

980
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:19,304
I assume
you mean the original cast

981
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:22,224
because there was a revival
in 1973 with Hal Linden...

982
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:24,310
I am gay!

983
01:03:24,477 --> 01:03:25,769
I rest my case.

984
01:03:25,937 --> 01:03:28,605
Wait. I can prove to you
that I am not gay.

985
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:29,772
Kiss me.

986
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,984
Oh! This is just sad.

987
01:03:33,152 --> 01:03:34,986
Will you shut up, bitch?

988
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:37,822
Please, Alison,
let me kiss you.

989
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,824
Remember the champagne,
the corpuscles?

990
01:03:40,992 --> 01:03:43,744
All right, Elliot, kiss me.

991
01:03:54,588 --> 01:03:55,838
I'm gay.

992
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:59,175
- Well, thanks for dropping by.
- Good night.

993
01:03:59,343 --> 01:04:01,010
Buh-bye.

994
01:04:02,387 --> 01:04:04,554
You've been drinking again,
haven't you?

995
01:04:04,722 --> 01:04:06,348
This is just like the night

996
01:04:06,515 --> 01:04:09,017
you had all those
Brandy Alexanders

997
01:04:09,185 --> 01:04:10,852
and ran up and down Fire Island

998
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,980
with your cute little Speedos,
singing "Evergreen" at the top...

999
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:19,151
And so the cow
was returned to its rightful owner.

1000
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:20,778
Okay, boys,

1001
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:23,197
tonight's homework.
Algebra.

1002
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:26,158
Xn + Yn = Zn.

1003
01:04:26,326 --> 01:04:29,620
Well, you're never
gonna use that, are you?

1004
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:34,207
Imperialism and the First World War.

1005
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:38,461
What was done is done.
No point thinking about it now.

1006
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:40,505
German, French, Spanish.

1007
01:04:40,673 --> 01:04:44,091
Ja, ja, oui, oui, sí, sí.
It's nonsense.

1008
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:45,634
Everyone speaks English anyway.

1009
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:48,428
And if they don't,
they ought to.

1010
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:50,722
So, no homework tonight.

1011
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,726
But I want you to watch
a lot of television,

1012
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:56,644
don't neglect your video games,

1013
01:04:56,812 --> 01:04:57,895
and I'll see you in the morning.

1014
01:04:58,063 --> 01:05:01,524
Shall we say 10:00, 10:30?

1015
01:05:01,692 --> 01:05:03,359
No point in getting up
too early, is there?

1016
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:12,076
Elliot, darling.

1017
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:15,246
What a lovely surprise!

1018
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:17,081
I hope you had a pleasant evening.

1019
01:05:17,249 --> 01:05:19,083
As if you didn't know.

1020
01:05:19,251 --> 01:05:20,584
I'm sorry, darling.

1021
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:22,752
I know it must be
really frustrating for you.

1022
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,921
Maybe I can make it up
to you somehow.

1023
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:28,550
Yeah, you've been
a really big help so far.

1024
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:31,761
I know. I've been really
naughty, haven't I?

1025
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,430
Maybe a good spanking's in order.

1026
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,599
Is that all you think about?
Do you think everything is about sex?

1027
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,518
No, of course not.

1028
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:43,605
I mean, there's greed, gluttony,
sloth, anger, vanity, envy.

1029
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,650
No, there's also honesty
and hard work

1030
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,986
and caring about people
and doing good for somebody else.

1031
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:53,614
Oh, you're just a big Boy Scout,
aren't you?

1032
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,784
I find that incredibly appealing.

1033
01:05:56,952 --> 01:05:59,537
No. All I've been doing
is thinking about myself.

1034
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:01,830
I could be doing all these
really important things

1035
01:06:01,998 --> 01:06:03,123
to help other people.

1036
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,791
What about Alison?

1037
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:08,211
Oh, I don't know anymore.
You mess it up anyway.

1038
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:10,756
I know that Alison's
not really like that.

1039
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:13,257
What exactly do you have in mind?

1040
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:16,844
I want to do something great
for mankind.

1041
01:06:17,012 --> 01:06:18,804
I want to create a better world.

1042
01:06:18,972 --> 01:06:22,475
I want to go down in history
for doing something really important

1043
01:06:22,642 --> 01:06:24,894
and I want Alison
to take me really seriously

1044
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,269
and to treat me with respect.

1045
01:06:26,437 --> 01:06:28,897
I sense a wish coming on.

1046
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,650
Yes!

1047
01:06:34,528 --> 01:06:35,904
I wish

1048
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:38,822
that I was the President
of the United States.

1049
01:06:40,116 --> 01:06:41,784
That is the noblest,

1050
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:44,369
most unselfish thing
I've ever heard.

1051
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:46,330
And it's a great way to meet girls.

1052
01:06:46,498 --> 01:06:49,124
Bless you, Elliot Richards,

1053
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:52,252
and Godspeed.

1054
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:58,467
Mr. President!

1055
01:06:58,635 --> 01:07:00,177
Alison Gardner.

1056
01:07:00,345 --> 01:07:02,846
We're so honored
to have you here, sir.

1057
01:07:07,351 --> 01:07:11,521
No, no, no.

1058
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:15,983
The actors are beside themselves
with excitement.

1059
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:17,526
We're going to a play?

1060
01:07:17,693 --> 01:07:19,277
I think you'll find it quite amusing.

1061
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:22,155
It's called "Our American Cousin."

1062
01:07:22,323 --> 01:07:24,866
You know, I think I've seen it.
As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.

1063
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:27,035
I don't think you've seen it, sir.

1064
01:07:27,203 --> 01:07:30,621
- It's an entirely new play.
- Really? I think I know how it ends.

1065
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:33,249
- Say, can we just go to a movie?
- A what?

1066
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,209
The president.

1067
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:46,261
You seem tense tonight,
Mr. President.

1068
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:49,264
Oh, well, you know,
I've had a lot on my mind,

1069
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:53,184
what with preserving the Union
and my wife going crazy and all.

1070
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,399
Can I help you find something,
Mr. President?

1071
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:02,944
Yeah, I'm looking for my pager.

1072
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,154
- Your what, sir?
- My pager.

1073
01:08:05,322 --> 01:08:08,407
It's this little red plastic thingy.

1074
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:12,411
It looks kind of like a cell phone,
only smaller.

1075
01:08:12,579 --> 01:08:14,121
I'm sorry! Sorry!

1076
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:20,335
All right, no problem.

1077
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:23,754
No problem! No problem!
No problem.

1078
01:08:25,424 --> 01:08:27,884
- Sic semper tyrannis.
- Wait!

1079
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:31,512
Okay.

1080
01:08:47,945 --> 01:08:49,529
You're late, Richards.

1081
01:08:49,697 --> 01:08:52,616
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

1082
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:54,492
See that it doesn't.

1083
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,703
I don't think a person
with your extremely limited

1084
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:59,496
personal-professional skills
can afford to push the envelope.

1085
01:08:59,664 --> 01:09:01,999
Yes, sir.

1086
01:09:04,628 --> 01:09:06,128
Thank you, sir.

1087
01:09:14,428 --> 01:09:15,720
Creep.

1088
01:09:17,848 --> 01:09:20,433
So tell me, how was it?
I'm dying to know.

1089
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:22,310
What are you doing here?

1090
01:09:22,478 --> 01:09:24,436
Just think of me
as a computer virus.

1091
01:09:24,604 --> 01:09:26,980
I think of you as a plague.

1092
01:09:27,148 --> 01:09:30,692
Now will you get off my screen?
I have work to do.

1093
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:34,154
Whoa, what's this whole
"get thee behind me" thing?

1094
01:09:34,322 --> 01:09:36,448
We still have business here,
Mr. Richards.

1095
01:09:36,616 --> 01:09:39,742
No, not now.
I told you, I've got work to do.

1096
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,577
And besides,
I've only got two wishes left

1097
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:43,663
- and I don't want to screw them up.
- Correction.

1098
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,039
You have one wish left.

1099
01:09:45,207 --> 01:09:48,376
Nice try.

1100
01:09:48,543 --> 01:09:52,253
- I've got two more coming.
- No. Count them, baby.

1101
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:56,007
- You were President of the US.
- Yeah, okay, one.

1102
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:58,218
You were a charming,
handsome, articulate,

1103
01:09:58,386 --> 01:10:00,011
celebrated author and raconteur.

1104
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:03,180
Yeah, and you turned me
into a flaming homosexual.

1105
01:10:03,348 --> 01:10:05,391
- Professional basketball player.
- Three.

1106
01:10:05,558 --> 01:10:07,559
The sensitive, caring,
artistic guy was four.

1107
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:09,269
And the Colombian drug lord was five.

1108
01:10:09,437 --> 01:10:12,356
- That means I have two more coming.
- You forgot the Big Mac and Coke.

1109
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:15,858
- What? That wasn't a wish.
- What do you call it?

1110
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:19,070
You said, "I wish," and I got it
for you. Sounds like a wish to me.

1111
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:21,531
No! No, no, no, no.
That's not fair.

1112
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:24,200
Fair? Who do you think
you're talking to?

1113
01:10:24,368 --> 01:10:27,371
I don't recall anybody
ever accusing me of being fair before.

1114
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:29,664
- I think I'm insulted.
- What? You can't...

1115
01:10:29,832 --> 01:10:31,666
no, this isn't right!
You can't do this!

1116
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:33,668
What are you gonna do?
Sue me?

1117
01:10:33,836 --> 01:10:35,336
No! That's it!

1118
01:10:35,504 --> 01:10:37,547
I've had it with you!

1119
01:10:37,715 --> 01:10:38,881
The whole deal is off.

1120
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:40,717
Off!

1121
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:43,885
Shut up!

1122
01:10:59,234 --> 01:11:00,401
Are you all right?

1123
01:11:02,738 --> 01:11:03,904
Not really.

1124
01:11:06,824 --> 01:11:08,450
I need to talk to God.

1125
01:11:08,617 --> 01:11:10,493
Well, that's the power of prayer.

1126
01:11:10,661 --> 01:11:13,079
Just say what's in your heart
and He hears.

1127
01:11:13,247 --> 01:11:14,581
No, you don't understand.

1128
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:17,333
I really need to talk to Him.

1129
01:11:17,501 --> 01:11:19,626
Now. It's urgent.

1130
01:11:19,794 --> 01:11:22,337
Is it something you can tell me?

1131
01:11:22,505 --> 01:11:25,924
No, it's personal.

1132
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:28,802
There's nothing you could say
that I wouldn't understand.

1133
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:31,096
Um...

1134
01:11:31,264 --> 01:11:33,389
Why don't you just try me?

1135
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:35,266
Okay, a few days ago,

1136
01:11:35,434 --> 01:11:37,435
I sold my soul to the devil
for seven wishes.

1137
01:11:37,603 --> 01:11:39,979
I've already had five of them,
but the devil says I've had six.

1138
01:11:40,147 --> 01:11:41,898
But I'm not counting
the Big Mac and the Coke,

1139
01:11:42,066 --> 01:11:44,859
and she is and I don't think
that's fair, do you?

1140
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:50,280
This is so unnecessary.

1141
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:53,325
- You're coming downtown.
- The devil gypped me for a burger!

1142
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:55,368
Tell your story to the sergeant.

1143
01:11:55,536 --> 01:11:57,912
So do you have a copy
of this contract?

1144
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,414
No, I told you, she keeps it
in her office.

1145
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:03,918
- At this nightclub in Oakland.
- Yes, at a nightclub

1146
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,461
and, no, I can't tell you where it is.

1147
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:07,588
Because you promised
the devil you wouldn't?

1148
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:09,632
No, because she drove.
That's why.

1149
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,927
Right.
In a Lamborghini Diablo.

1150
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,805
- Look, Officer.
- Sergeant.

1151
01:12:15,972 --> 01:12:18,182
Sergeant, I know my rights.

1152
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:20,142
I don't have to talk to you
without a lawyer.

1153
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,228
So you either book me
or you let me go.

1154
01:12:22,395 --> 01:12:24,145
Oh, gee, are those my choices?

1155
01:12:24,313 --> 01:12:26,523
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?

1156
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,609
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.

1157
01:12:29,777 --> 01:12:30,819
Arraignment in the morning.

1158
01:12:30,986 --> 01:12:32,862
- Drunk and disorderly.
- What?! Hey!

1159
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:36,157
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It's her! It's her, she's the devil!

1160
01:12:36,324 --> 01:12:39,785
One more word out of you and
I'll pop you one, you whacko bastard.

1161
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:41,829
Now move it.

1162
01:12:48,754 --> 01:12:50,003
Spread them.

1163
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:53,799
There's no point fighting about this.

1164
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:57,845
You have to learn to accept
the inevitable.

1165
01:12:58,012 --> 01:12:59,847
We're all doomed anyway,

1166
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:02,473
so you might as well
just get with the program,

1167
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:05,893
wish your way out of here,
and move on.

1168
01:13:08,355 --> 01:13:11,315
I wasn't kidding
when I said I liked you.

1169
01:13:11,483 --> 01:13:12,859
I do, Elliot.

1170
01:13:13,026 --> 01:13:16,194
I think you have
massive potential.

1171
01:13:16,362 --> 01:13:18,864
If you're looking
at an eternity in hell,

1172
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:21,116
let me tell you,

1173
01:13:21,284 --> 01:13:24,578
it wouldn't hurt
to have a friend like me.

1174
01:13:32,043 --> 01:13:35,671
So you just think about that.
Give me a call when you're ready.

1175
01:13:44,513 --> 01:13:46,014
She's a devil, that one.

1176
01:13:46,182 --> 01:13:47,724
What?

1177
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,565
I said, she's a devil,
that lady cop.

1178
01:14:00,321 --> 01:14:02,614
Yeah, I guess.

1179
01:14:02,781 --> 01:14:04,616
What you in for, brother?

1180
01:14:05,867 --> 01:14:06,909
Eternity.

1181
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:09,620
Oh, that's a long time.

1182
01:14:09,787 --> 01:14:12,956
You must have did
some really bad shit.

1183
01:14:13,124 --> 01:14:14,750
Yeah.

1184
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:18,212
I sold my soul.

1185
01:14:18,379 --> 01:14:20,421
Hope you got something good for it.

1186
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,882
As a matter of fact,
I got nothing for it.

1187
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,635
Well, that's a really bad deal,
if you ask me.

1188
01:14:25,802 --> 01:14:29,722
Well, I'm not asking you.

1189
01:14:35,102 --> 01:14:37,354
Doesn't really matter, though.

1190
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:40,482
- You can't sell your soul anyway.
- Oh, really?

1191
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,817
Why do you say that?

1192
01:14:42,985 --> 01:14:45,402
It doesn't really belong to you
in the first place.

1193
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,279
No way, nohow.

1194
01:14:47,447 --> 01:14:50,908
So who does it belong to?

1195
01:14:54,913 --> 01:14:57,288
It belongs to God.

1196
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,165
That universal spirit that animates

1197
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,210
and binds all things in existence.

1198
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:07,924
The devil gonna try to confuse you.
But that's her gig.

1199
01:15:08,092 --> 01:15:11,301
But in the end, you'll see clear
to who and what you are

1200
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:13,303
and what you're here to do.

1201
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:15,931
Now, you're gonna make
some mistakes along the way,

1202
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,307
everybody does,

1203
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:20,852
but if you just open up your heart
and open up your mind,

1204
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,980
you'll get it.

1205
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:27,483
Who are you?

1206
01:15:30,362 --> 01:15:32,822
Just a friend, brother.

1207
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,657
Just a really good friend.

1208
01:16:40,802 --> 01:16:42,636
Hey, baby!

1209
01:16:52,563 --> 01:16:53,938
We love you, Elliot!

1210
01:16:54,106 --> 01:16:56,274
Elliot, darling.

1211
01:16:56,442 --> 01:16:58,610
So nice of you to drop by.

1212
01:16:58,778 --> 01:17:01,154
Come into my office.

1213
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:05,532
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're having a fabulous time.

1214
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,368
Pathetic, aren't they?

1215
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:09,578
Everybody wants to go
to the party,

1216
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:12,998
but nobody wants
to pay the piper.

1217
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:14,958
- Are you...?
- Don't get too excited.

1218
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:17,960
It's just a Halloween costume.

1219
01:17:18,128 --> 01:17:20,963
Anyway, Elliot, my darling,
have you thought of your last wish?

1220
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:22,840
No.

1221
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:25,427
Well, I hate to put a big rush on this,
but there is a time limit.

1222
01:17:25,595 --> 01:17:26,762
Read your contract.

1223
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:38,649
I really don't want another wish.

1224
01:17:38,817 --> 01:17:40,776
That's funny.

1225
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:42,319
Do you think
this halo's too much?

1226
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:46,155
No. I really don't want it.

1227
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:50,660
What do you mean,
you don't want it?

1228
01:17:50,828 --> 01:17:52,495
You get seven wishes.

1229
01:17:52,663 --> 01:17:54,705
There's nothing I want.

1230
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:59,918
Well, there are things that I want,
but nothing that you can give me.

1231
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:03,130
What is that supposed to mean?

1232
01:18:03,297 --> 01:18:05,549
Well...

1233
01:18:05,716 --> 01:18:07,926
last night,
when I was lying in jail,

1234
01:18:08,094 --> 01:18:09,135
I was talking to this guy

1235
01:18:09,302 --> 01:18:12,096
and I realized that wishing
just doesn't work.

1236
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:14,306
All my life I wished
to be better-looking,

1237
01:18:14,474 --> 01:18:17,351
richer, successful, talented, whatever.

1238
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:19,562
I always thought it'd be great
if someone could just wave

1239
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:21,813
a magic wand
and make that happen.

1240
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:24,941
Well, I realized that
it just doesn't work by magic.

1241
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:27,777
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1242
01:18:27,945 --> 01:18:31,656
And I've been
starting to think that

1243
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:35,159
it really isn't that important
how far we go in life anyway.

1244
01:18:35,326 --> 01:18:37,369
It's how we get there
that really matters.

1245
01:18:37,537 --> 01:18:39,079
Oh.

1246
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,833
You know,
that is so inspiring.

1247
01:18:44,377 --> 01:18:45,836
So it's okay?

1248
01:18:46,004 --> 01:18:49,172
Well, no, Elliot.
I'm afraid it's not okay.

1249
01:18:49,339 --> 01:18:50,590
A deal's a deal.

1250
01:18:50,757 --> 01:18:53,134
You get one more wish,
and I get your soul.

1251
01:18:53,302 --> 01:18:55,136
So let's just get on with it,
shall we?

1252
01:18:55,304 --> 01:18:58,973
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh, really?

1253
01:18:59,141 --> 01:19:01,683
Before you get all hinky,
I should warn you.

1254
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:04,019
I'm not all peaches and cream,
you know.

1255
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:07,898
I do have a darker side
and, believe me, it's not pretty.

1256
01:19:08,065 --> 01:19:10,817
Now you can go easy,
or you can go hard,

1257
01:19:10,985 --> 01:19:13,986
but one way or another,
I will get your soul.

1258
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:15,821
I'm not gonna do it.

1259
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:19,200
There's nothing that you can say
or do that will make me.

1260
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:21,119
Oh, I think you'll change your mind.

1261
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:23,788
I'm just gonna slip into
something a little more terrifying.

1262
01:19:23,956 --> 01:19:25,207
See you in hell!

1263
01:19:34,382 --> 01:19:36,550
Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait a minute!

1264
01:19:38,802 --> 01:19:40,136
Wait!

1265
01:19:41,847 --> 01:19:45,058
Now listen to me,
you disgusting little maggot!

1266
01:19:45,226 --> 01:19:46,935
This is your last chance

1267
01:19:47,102 --> 01:19:49,437
before the big weenie roast!

1268
01:19:49,605 --> 01:19:52,731
Make a wish or forever burn in hell!

1269
01:19:52,899 --> 01:19:55,776
Okay! Okay!

1270
01:19:55,944 --> 01:19:57,903
I wish...

1271
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:00,405
I wish that Alison has a happy life.

1272
01:20:00,573 --> 01:20:02,741
Oh, God.

1273
01:20:28,099 --> 01:20:30,140
Is this heaven?

1274
01:20:30,308 --> 01:20:32,601
Heaven?
God, no, it's the courthouse.

1275
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:34,770
I'm just meeting
a couple of lawyers for lunch.

1276
01:20:34,938 --> 01:20:36,814
Clients of mine.
Come on.

1277
01:20:38,358 --> 01:20:41,610
Wait, what happened
to the whole,

1278
01:20:41,778 --> 01:20:43,861
you know, fire

1279
01:20:44,029 --> 01:20:48,157
- and the big, horny guy with...
- Oh, just a few special effects.

1280
01:20:48,325 --> 01:20:50,785
Sort of the Universal Studios
tour of evil.

1281
01:20:50,953 --> 01:20:54,664
It normally works pretty well,
but evidently you weren't going for it.

1282
01:20:54,832 --> 01:20:56,665
Your last wish
was a deal-breaker.

1283
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:59,835
- What?
- Nobody ever reads the contract.

1284
01:21:00,003 --> 01:21:02,963
Article 147, paragraph 9, section 3:

1285
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:04,756
Selfless acts of redemption.

1286
01:21:04,924 --> 01:21:06,133
Huh?

1287
01:21:06,301 --> 01:21:09,177
Basically, it says,
"If you commit one truly benevolent act,

1288
01:21:09,345 --> 01:21:10,637
it voids the contract."

1289
01:21:10,805 --> 01:21:12,598
So I get to keep my soul?

1290
01:21:12,765 --> 01:21:15,225
Yes, you get to keep your soul.

1291
01:21:17,103 --> 01:21:18,395
Yes!

1292
01:21:20,607 --> 01:21:24,358
Yes! I get to keep my soul!

1293
01:21:30,115 --> 01:21:33,284
On November 16th, I'll have been
doing this for 6,000 years

1294
01:21:33,452 --> 01:21:36,119
and you're the first person
to give away one of their wishes.

1295
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:37,829
I hope it's not
the beginning of a trend.

1296
01:21:37,997 --> 01:21:40,498
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- No, no, I promise.

1297
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:42,751
Nope.

1298
01:21:42,918 --> 01:21:47,504
I don't get it, though.
I mean, why are you being nice?

1299
01:21:47,672 --> 01:21:50,966
Look, Elliot.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

1300
01:21:51,134 --> 01:21:52,926
The whole "good and evil" thing...

1301
01:21:53,094 --> 01:21:54,970
you know, Him and me.

1302
01:21:55,138 --> 01:21:57,306
It really comes down to you.

1303
01:21:57,474 --> 01:21:59,515
You don't have to look hard
for heaven and hell.

1304
01:21:59,683 --> 01:22:02,352
They're right here on Earth.

1305
01:22:02,519 --> 01:22:04,771
You make the choice.

1306
01:22:04,938 --> 01:22:06,482
And I guess you just made yours.

1307
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:08,525
So I can go now?

1308
01:22:08,693 --> 01:22:10,944
Unless you want another
seven wishes.

1309
01:22:12,363 --> 01:22:14,822
- No, thanks.
- Didn't think so.

1310
01:22:16,533 --> 01:22:18,242
I really liked you, you know.

1311
01:22:20,204 --> 01:22:23,247
Well, to tell you the truth,

1312
01:22:23,415 --> 01:22:25,248
you've been the best friend
I've ever had.

1313
01:22:25,416 --> 01:22:27,709
Oh, dear.
Don't go gushy on me now.

1314
01:22:27,877 --> 01:22:29,544
Okay.

1315
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:33,548
Go on. Go.
You'll scare the fish away.

1316
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:54,860
Alison?

1317
01:22:55,028 --> 01:22:57,405
- Hi.
- Hi.

1318
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:58,614
Oh, uh...

1319
01:22:58,782 --> 01:23:01,242
Elliot Richards.
We've met a couple times.

1320
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:04,786
Yeah, I remember.
Hi, how are you?

1321
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:06,162
I'm great.

1322
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,415
I'm exaggerating.
I'm good.

1323
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:15,255
We've been working together here
for the last four years

1324
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,756
and I've always noticed you

1325
01:23:17,924 --> 01:23:21,927
and thought that you looked
like a very interesting person.

1326
01:23:22,095 --> 01:23:24,722
I don't know how interesting I am.

1327
01:23:24,889 --> 01:23:28,641
Well, the truth is I don't know you
and you don't know me,

1328
01:23:28,809 --> 01:23:31,602
and if we were
to get to know each other

1329
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,896
that there's a chance
that we just might hit it off.

1330
01:23:34,064 --> 01:23:38,025
So I was wondering if you wanted
to go get a cup of coffee or...

1331
01:23:38,193 --> 01:23:41,528
That's really so nice of you.

1332
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,321
I'm seeing someone.

1333
01:23:46,284 --> 01:23:48,618
Well, of course you are.

1334
01:23:48,786 --> 01:23:52,122
He's sure one lucky guy.

1335
01:23:53,624 --> 01:23:56,459
Listen, if it ever doesn't
work out with him, then...

1336
01:23:59,296 --> 01:24:00,546
- That's so nice of you.
- Really?

1337
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:02,590
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks a lot.

1338
01:24:02,758 --> 01:24:05,634
- I'll see you around.
- Okay, take care. Bye.

1339
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:10,972
- Go. It's a joke.
- It's only 10 bucks.

1340
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:14,142
- What's he gonna do?
- Right.

1341
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:16,478
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot, so-smelliot.

1342
01:24:16,645 --> 01:24:18,813
What's up, dudester?
Yeah.

1343
01:24:18,981 --> 01:24:20,647
What do you say we go down
to the club tonight

1344
01:24:20,815 --> 01:24:23,859
and pick up some chickette?

1345
01:24:26,613 --> 01:24:27,821
Nice talking to you, Bob.

1346
01:25:02,522 --> 01:25:03,897
- Hey.
- New neighbors?

1347
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:05,357
Guess so.

1348
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:11,028
Hi. Oh.

1349
01:25:11,196 --> 01:25:13,739
Hi. You must be the boy next door.

1350
01:25:13,907 --> 01:25:15,699
Do you want to give me a hand?

1351
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,870
Habla English?
Spracht English?

1352
01:25:20,038 --> 01:25:22,498
Parlez-vous "Americiano"?

1353
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:28,711
- Hi, I'm Elliot Richards.
- Hey. Nicole Delarusso.

1354
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:31,714
Don't call me Nicky, though.
Everyone always calls me Nicky.

1355
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:34,384
It starts as Nicole,
then becomes Nicky, then Nick,

1356
01:25:34,552 --> 01:25:37,553
then Ni, then just "Nn."
People just call me "Nn."

1357
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,096
I'm cracking myself up here.

1358
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:41,390
- You want to give me a hand?
- Yes, I do.

1359
01:25:41,558 --> 01:25:44,017
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.

1360
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:45,561
You got the new Ingebritzens!

1361
01:25:45,728 --> 01:25:48,105
- Yeah, they're the best!
- They're the best!

1362
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:54,026
I'd be happy to hook
these up for you

1363
01:25:54,194 --> 01:25:57,572
so you could have some music,
if you wanted, while you're unpacking.

1364
01:25:57,739 --> 01:26:00,616
I could make us dinner...
that way you won't have to cook.

1365
01:26:00,784 --> 01:26:02,701
Yeah, right.
Me, cook?

1366
01:26:02,869 --> 01:26:04,244
Thank you.

1367
01:26:04,412 --> 01:26:07,789
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen
to have a sister, would you?

1368
01:26:07,957 --> 01:26:10,709
No sisters,
but I've got a lot of brothers, though.

1369
01:26:10,877 --> 01:26:12,878
 Hey, hey 

1370
01:26:13,045 --> 01:26:16,171
 Did you ever think
that there might be another way? 

1371
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:20,426
 Just feel better,
just feel better about today 

1372
01:26:20,594 --> 01:26:23,178
 Oh, no 

1373
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:26,932
 If you never wanna
have to turn and go away 

1374
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:31,353
 You might feel better,
might feel better if you stay 

1375
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:35,149
 Yeah, yeah 

1376
01:26:35,317 --> 01:26:38,277
 I bet you haven't heard
a word I've said 

1377
01:26:38,445 --> 01:26:40,446
 Yeah, yeah 

1378
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:43,323
 I've had enough of all your trying 

1379
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:47,286
 Just give up
the state of mind you're in 

1380
01:26:47,454 --> 01:26:52,041
 If you wanna be somebody else 

1381
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:58,338
 If you're tired of fighting battles
with yourself 

1382
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:02,634
 If you wanna be somebody else 

1383
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:12,976
 Change your life 

1384
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,564
 Hey, hey 

1385
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,858
 Have you ever danced in the rain
or thanked the sun 

1386
01:27:21,026 --> 01:27:23,486
 Just for shining,
just for shining 

1387
01:27:23,654 --> 01:27:25,321
 Or the sea 

1388
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:27,949
 Oh, no 

1389
01:27:28,116 --> 01:27:31,243
 Take it all in,
the world's a show, and, yeah 

1390
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:35,538
 You look much better,
look much better when you glow 

1391
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,334
 Yeah, yeah 

1392
01:27:39,502 --> 01:27:42,629
 I hope you've heard
every word I've said 

1393
01:27:42,797 --> 01:27:44,755
 Yeah, yeah 

1394
01:27:44,923 --> 01:27:47,883
 If you've had enough
of all your trying 

1395
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:52,221
 Just give up the state of mind
you're in 

1396
01:27:52,389 --> 01:27:56,684
 If you wanna be somebody else 

1397
01:27:56,851 --> 01:28:02,939
 If you're tired of fighting battles
with yourself 

1398
01:28:03,107 --> 01:28:07,151
 If you wanna be somebody else 

1399
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:17,704
 Change your mind 

1400
01:28:19,206 --> 01:28:29,214
 Ooh, yeah 

1401
01:28:36,138 --> 01:28:37,471
 Hey, hey 

1402
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:41,058
 What ya say we both go
and seize the day 

1403
01:28:41,226 --> 01:28:45,354
 'Cause what's your hurry,
what's your hurry, anyway? 

1404
01:28:47,232 --> 01:28:49,399
 Yeah, yeah 

1405
01:28:49,567 --> 01:28:52,277
 I hope you've heard
every word I've said 

1406
01:28:52,445 --> 01:28:54,529
 Yeah, yeah 

1407
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:57,574
 If you've had enough
of all your trying 

1408
01:28:57,742 --> 01:29:01,785
 Just give up the state of mind
you're in 

1409
01:29:04,497 --> 01:29:09,084
 If you wanna be somebody else 

1410
01:29:09,252 --> 01:29:15,214
 If you're tired of losing battles
with yourself 

1411
01:29:15,382 --> 01:29:19,469
 If you wanna be somebody else 

1412
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:40,654
 Change your mind 

1413
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:56,211
 Ooh, yeah 

1414
01:29:56,378 --> 01:30:02,468
 Ooh, yeah.
