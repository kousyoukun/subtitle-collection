Wow! All right, no problem.

Hey, Dan, my man! What's up, my bro?

00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:16,104
来一下！正啊！
Yeah, put it there! All right. Yeah.

60
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,437
下班后跟那帮弟兄打篮球吗？
So hoops today? You and the guys up for some hoopage after work?

61
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,372
还没说定呢，艾略特
Uh, you know, we don't know yet, Elliot.

62
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,429
- I'm not sure yet, okay? - That's cool. Just let me know.

63
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,681
没关係，到时通知一声
'Cause I'm there, bud. That's right, 'cause I love the round ball.

64
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:31,109
我爱篮球，人称飞人艾略特
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."

65
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,438
- Yeah! - Okay.

66
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,624
时间不要说错，上星期…
Make sure that you let me know the right time

67
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,752
说六点半，我到时你们正要走
because last week you said 6:30

68
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,277
and when I got there, you guys were just leaving.

69
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,197
那不是很愚蠢吗？
I mean, how stupid did you feel?

70
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,256
是很愚蠢，艾略特
Pretty stupid, Elliot.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,498
小事啦，丹尼，手举高
Not a problem, Danny. Give it up.

72
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,399
嘿，你们好吗？
- Man: Hey, Daniel. - Hey, man, how you doing?

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,372
Good, good. How you doing, man?

74
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,677
嘿，鲍伯
Hey, Bob!

75
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,042
有事吗？
- What's up? - Hey, Elliot.

76
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,444
你们那一伙今晚去喝一杯吗？
You and your posse gonna hit the brewery tonight?

77
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:05,722
我这伙？不，他们忙著…
My "posse"? No.

78
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,346
Uh, they're all busy with the big...

79
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,780
脖子怎麽了？
- What's with your neck? - Oh, nothing.

80
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,728
没事，操劳过度，耳机伤害
It's a repetitive stress disorder. It's a headset injury.

81
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,357
去喝两杯钓个马子怎样？
So what do you say you and me go and knock back some suds

82
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,147
and check out the babes?

83
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,724
不，我结婚了，记得吗？
Elliot, I'm married, remember?

84
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,398
我要回家陪老婆
I'm gonna go home, spend some time with my wife.

85
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,654
Oh.

86
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,005
接受老婆的鞭策呦
Taking a trip to Whipville.

87
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,577
你做那个愈来愈有趣
It just gets funnier every time you do that.

88
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,614
不要！不要！
Don't, don't, don't...

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,048
嘿，谢利！
Elliot: Hey, Jerry!

90
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,449
谢利，谢谢瑞瑞，谢利！
Jerry, Jerry, bo-berry, fee-fi-fo-ferry, Jerry!

91
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,757
怎麽样啊，老哥？
Hey, what's happening, brother?

92
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,122
赶著开会
- Running to an important meeting. - Oh, yeah.

93
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,419
等等，你会爱死的
- Yeah. - Hey, wait.

94
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,763
因为我们都是发烧友
No, I think you're gonna appreciate this,

95
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,561
这是英格布理逊的新喇叭
because we're both a couple of stereo component nuts.

96
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,390
Check these out, holmes. These are the new Ingebritzens.

97
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,362
左喇叭的背面，右喇叭的正面
- Right. - XVC speakers.

98
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,935
Here, look it. That's the back of the left speaker

99
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,812
and the front of the right speaker.

100
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,261
不错
Sweet, sweet, sweet.

101
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,901
这是左边的正面，不，是右边
That's the front of the left... no, that's the right...

102
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,784
我想…哦，不会吧！
I think... oh, man!

103
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,786
是艾略特
- Dan: What? - It's Elliot.

104
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,048
是谁告诉他我们在这裡？
Who told him we were here?

105
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,848
你跟他讲的吗？
- Oh, shit. - Did you tell him we were here?

106
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,787
嗨！
Hi!

107
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,766
你班人！
You guys!

108
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,551
Jerry: I told you not to...

109
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:31,307
逮到了，你们不是都在忙吗
Well, well, well, isn't this a big surprise?

110
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,723
I thought everybody was busy.

111
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,138
计划稍有更动
A slight change of plans, Elliot.

112
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,311
是吗？
Oh, is that right?

113
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,302
我有点不爽
Well, I'm a little bit peeved at you guys.

114
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,578
想甩开我，我不该坐下囉
I'm thinking you tried to ditch me. I might not even sit down with you.

115
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,875
推测合理，拜拜
We can certainly understand that, so we'll see you tomorrow.

116
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,820
再见，艾略特
- Later, Elliot. - I'm kidding!

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,186
开玩笑的！

118
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,016
要不要换个位置？
- Switch places with me. - No, I'm fine.

119
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,779
免谈

120
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,669
哦，妈妈咪啊
- What? - Oh, my goodness gracious.

121
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:05,106
拜託，别说你煞到爱丽生嘉纳
Dan: You've gotta be kidding!

122
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,588
Bob: Please, please, don't tell me

123
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,256
that you have a thing for Alison Gardner.

124
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,210
别痴心妄想
- Jerry: Oh, man! - Please.

125
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,169
植物都比他强… 她不是跟研发部的人交往？
Jerry: She's way out of your league.

126
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,554
Isn't she dating that guy in research?

127
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,716
布莱德？布莱恩？暴牙那个
Brian, with the teeth.

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,933
Brian? The guy with the teeth.

129
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,685
分手三个月了
No, that's been over for three months now.

130
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:17,811
你怎麽知道？
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that? - I know a lot of things about her.

131
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:21,724
对她我可清楚得很

132
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,919
她喜欢加奶油不烤的贝果
I know that she likes her bagels buttered, but not toasted.

133
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,729
哇 好清楚啊
- Wow. - How specific.

134
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:31,757
她穿什麽颜色都美唯独蓝色…
I know that she looks beautiful in any color,

135
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,450
but when she wears blue...

136
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,121
Sounds like you guys are old friends?

137
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,670
听起来好像你是她的老朋友
Well, we have been working together

138
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,172
我们同事四年了
at the same company for four years.

139
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,938
自然会彼此熟识
You spend time together, people get to know each other.

140
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:46,249
所以过去打声招呼应该没问题
It's true, so it should be no problem

141
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,589
for you to just get up, walk over there, and say hello.

142
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:48,217
不，她跟朋友在一起
She's with somebody. I'll catch up with her tomorrow.

143
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,116
没关係啦！
- Come on! - Hold on, Elliot.

144
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:55,247
艾略特，老实说 你从没跟爱丽生说过话对吧？
Come clean here.

145
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,849
You have never spoken to Alison Gardner, right?

146
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,520
当然说过
Of course I have.

147
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,990
艾略特，你真是可悲啊
- Did I say "queer" earlier? - You are pathetic, Elliot! Really.

148
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,765
看来不过去打声招呼
Okay, I guess you guys are just not gonna let me relax tonight

149
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,495
你们是不会放过我
until I go over there and say hello.

150
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,737
既然你们非这样才爽
- Carol: I guess not. - Yeah.

151
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,156
Well, if that'll make you happy. You think I'm pathetic.

152
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:12,172
看看是谁可悲

153
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,105
不要碰我
- Don't touch me. - Carol: Go for it, tiger.

154
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,777
加油，屁仙

155
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,711
祝你好运
Dan: Good luck.

156
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,187
嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

157
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,848
我认识你吗？
Do I know you?

158
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,294
应该认识
Oh, I should hope so.

159
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,730
我们在西耐登同事四年了
We've only been working together at Synedyne for the last four years.

160
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,789
艾略特裡察
I'm Elliot Richards.

161
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,802
我们说过话
We've spoken.

162
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:41,997
对不起，我不…
I'm sorry, I don't...

163
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,603
三年前，六月的第一个星期
It was the first week of June, three years ago.

164
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,275
我说外面下雨
I said it was wet out.

165
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,768
我们在大厅，我说外面下雨
We were standing in the lobby, and I said it was really wet out.

166
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,906
那时正下著雨
It was raining at the time.

167
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:56,308
应该是吧
I assume that.

168
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
没错
Yeah.

169
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,876
So here we are, talking again.

170
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,158
现在又再度跟你说话

171
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,294
Yeah.

172
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,595
别紧张
Well, take it easy.

173
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,831
跟朋友在这，不知道你想不…
I'm here with friends and I was wondering if you wanted...

174
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:38,020
上帝，为了她我愿意付出一切
Dear God, I would give anything to have that girl in my life.

175
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,553
嗨
- Hi. - Hello.

176
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,986
哈囉

177
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,921
不知道…
I was wondering...

178
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,526
如果…唔…这个…
if this is...

179
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,052
唔，我站在那儿…唔…
I was standing over there and...

180
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,759
你好自在啊
You're very glib. I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.

181
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,091
对女人一定很有一套

182
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,035
你一个人吗？
- Well... - You here alone?

183
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,233
不，跟几个好同事一起
No!

184
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm here with some buddies from work.

185
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,111
我看到你跟个女孩说话
I saw you talking to a woman.

186
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,547
是啊，但我不是跟她一起
Yeah, but I'm not with her.

187
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,811
但，你想跟她在一起
But you'd like to be, huh?

188
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,608
你怎麽会这麽说？
What makes you say that?

189
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,953
不知道，当男人说 为某个女人付出一切
I don't know.

190
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,322
When a man says he'd give anything

191
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,990
to have a certain woman in his life,

192
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,592
我想她对他有某种意义
I just assume she means something to him.

193
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,287
你怎麽听得到？
How did you hear me say that?

194
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:08,123
我有顺风耳…和其他特殊天赋
- I was standing way over... - I have fantastic hearing.

195
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,916
And a number of other equally impressive talents.

196
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,438
哇靠！
Ho-doggie!

197
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,636
我们可以找个地方聊聊
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk.

198
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,653
好啊，什麽？你要跟我聊？
Okay... what? You want to talk to me?

199
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,350
有问题吗？我不够吸引？
Is there a problem?

200
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,023
Are you not attracted to me?

201
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,091
不
No.

202
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,993
我觉得你又辣又呛
I think you're hot.

203
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,326
宝贝，你不知道的还多著呢
Baby, you have no idea.

204
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,160
吻我
- Kiss me. - What? Here?

205
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,504
在这？

206
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,837
别怕探索新世界
Don't be afraid to explore new horizons.

207
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,212
Oh.

208
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,121
借个两秒钟好吗？
Can you give us two seconds, girls?

209
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,626
借个两秒钟可以吗？
Yeah, can you give us two seconds?

210
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,226
Sure.

211
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,355
悉听尊便
Whatever.

212
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,257
听好
Listen...

213
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:20,661
你好得很骇人
you seem really nice,

214
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,279
in a strong,

215
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,403
但，我朋友可能在等我
scary kind of a way,

216
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,575
but my friends are probably waiting for me,

217
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,213
所以我该走了
so I'm gonna just get going.

218
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,408
你好紧张，艾略特
You're so nervous, Elliot.

219
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,546
你怎麽知道我的名字？
How do you know my name?

220
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,881
超能力，此外，你挂著名牌
I'm psychic.

221
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,294
Plus, it's on your name tag.

222
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,655
蠢
Duh.

223
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,386
来谈点儿正事
Now then, I just want to talk business for a second.

224
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, I'm not into that.

225
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,362
没兴趣，我不花钱买性 除了网路以外？
I mean, I've never paid for sex before.

226
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,519
Except this one time... there was an Internet thing.

227
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,739
一旦注册以后 不就都是性、性、性
I mean, you can't help it. Every time you sign on, it's "sex, sex, sex."

228
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,640
我不是妓女，只是有个问题
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy. I just want to ask you a question.

229
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:02,737
想不想作个改变一生的决定？
How would you like to make one simple decision

230
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,197
that'll change your life forever?

231
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,650
你大可相信宗教科学论，但…
Okay, I'm glad Scientology works for you, but...

232
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,515
先听我说
Just listen.

233
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,087
如果我有神奇的力量…
What if I told you that I have the cataclysmic power

234
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,319
…让你的梦想一一实现
to give you anything and everything you've always dreamed of?

235
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,594
你是谁？
Who are you?

236
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,494
答应我不能说出去？
Promise not to tell anyone?

237
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,768
好
Okay.

238
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,259
画个X发誓不得好死
Cross your heart and hope to die?

239
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,639
Yeah.

240
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,836
我是魔鬼
I'm the devil.

241
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,273
真的啊
Okay.

242
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,219
看来有人马丁尼喝多了
I think somebody's had "tee many martoonis"!

243
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,311
我是魔鬼
I am the devil. Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub.

244
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,722
撒旦、路西伏、黑暗王子

245
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,658
黑暗女王啦
The Prince of Darkness.

246
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,994
Well, the Princess of Darkness, anyway.

247
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,388
我的名片
Here's my card.

248
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,747
Oh.

249
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,801
「魔鬼」没错
"The devil." Yep.

250
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,701
解释得很清楚
That explains it.

251
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,135
现在我相信了
Now I believe you.

252
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,400
晚安，乖乖
Night-night.

253
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,802
你真是多疑
You're a very skeptical person, you know that?

254
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,978
你怎麽会…？你…
How did...

255
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,433
How did you just... and you...

256
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,379
只要你相信「我是魔鬼」…
Look. If you could just buy into this "I'm the devil" thing,

257
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,416
可以省掉很多麻烦
it'll save us both a lot of these questions.

258
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,690
或许我该帮你叫计程车
Maybe I should call you a cab.

259
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,830
只怕这时候找不到要下地狱的
Although it's gonna be hard to find one that'll go to hell this time of night.

260
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,731
好幽默啊
Oh! What a delightfully piquant wit.

261
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:32,099
我们会处得很好的，干了！
I can see we're gonna get along famously.

262
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,287
Cheers, darling.

263
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,832
你在干什麽？你不能…
Are you... you can't... look at... jeez!

264
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,845
天啊

265
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:43,337
不能这样，很危险的！
You can't do that. That's very dangerous!

266
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,340
你为什麽不肯相信？
Why is this so hard for you to believe?

267
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,321
你以为我只是用来吓小孩子的
Do you think your mommy and daddy just made me up so you'd be good?

268
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,722
好，你是魔鬼，你想干嘛？
Okay, okay. You're the devil. What do you want with me?

269
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,225
希望你快乐，你很有潜力
I want you to be happy, Elliot. You have such potential.

270
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,830
你只需要别人推一把
All you need is a little push in the right direction.

271
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,798
我已经很快乐！
I am happy!

272
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,232
得了吧，不必对我撒谎
Oh, please! You don't have to lie to me.

273
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,372
我知道你心裡每一个坏念头
I know every dark thought in your tiny little mind.

274
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,603
你每晚回到可怕的公寓
I know that every night you go home to your horrible little apartment

275
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,208
吃冷冻食物，爆米花
and you eat your little frozen dinner, and you make your little bowl of popcorn

276
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,576
看电视看到眼睛睁不开
and watch TV until you can't keep your eyes open anymore.

277
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,318
然后爬上床
And then you crawl off to bed

278
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:25,255
搞不懂为什麽孤单又没人爱
and wonder why you're alone and nobody likes you.

279
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,892
并不是每晚都这样
Not every night.

280
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,486
你还哭
And you cry.

281
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,525
是啊！
Yeah, sure.

282
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:40,236
我瞭解你，你现在可以哭
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.

283
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,479
You could cry right now.

284
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,914
我说的是再生，控制命运
I'm talking about reinvention, taking control of your destiny.

285
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,543
你希望被喜欢，被爱？
You want to be liked?

286
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,284
You want to be loved?

287
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,886
被尊重呢？
How about respected?

288
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,718
让别人怕你？
How about feared?

289
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,928
你倒底在说什麽？
What exactly are we talking about?

290
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,694
想尝试吗？许个愿
You want to see how it works, baby?

291
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,381
Wish for something.

292
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,433
什麽愿？
- Like what? - Whatever you want, it's yours.

293
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,130
随便，只要说出来

294
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,969
Just say the word.

295
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,939
好…
Okay,

296
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,305
我要一份麦香堡和大可
I wish I had a Big Mac and a large Coke.

297
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,605
没问题
It is done.

298
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,453
需要什麽？
Hi, how you doing? What can I get you?

299
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,444
麦香堡和大可
A Big Mac and a large Coke.

300
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:30,456
要薯条吗？
Fries?

301
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,617
不要
No.

302
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,619
一共$3.47
Comes to $3.47.

303
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,191
你有$3.47吗？
Do you have $3.47?

304
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,455
我的皮包留在地底下
I left my purse in the underworld.

305
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:46,461
没错，这绝对是魔鬼的把戏
Oh, yes! This truly is the work of the devil!

306
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,873
还怪我怀疑你，我要走了
And to think that I doubted you! I'm gonna go now.

307
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,840
怎麽啦？
What's the problem?

308
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,411
这能证明什麽？
This doesn't prove anything!

309
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,483
这我也会，还要我付钱
I could have done this myself. I even had to pay for it.

310
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,178
天下没有白吃的午餐
No such thing as a free lunch. Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

311
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,986
没听过吗？
I didn't even get any fries.

312
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,954
连薯条都没吃到

313
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,490
真不敢相信
Oh, I don't believe this.

314
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,958
我给你改变一生的机会
I'm offering you the opportunity of a lifetime

315
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,392
你竟然抱怨没薯条
and all you can do is moan about French fries?

316
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,655
晚安
- Good night. - Oh, fine! Okay.

317
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:15,296
拿你没辙，算了
I'm obviously not getting through to you, so let's just forget it.

318
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,527
我载你去开车
Come on, I'll give you a lift back to your car.

319
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,030
那是你的车？
That's your car?

320
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,575
加州 天下第一坏

321
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,653
医院 肃静

322
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,217
dV8俱乐部
- Man: It's him! - Woman: It's Elliot!

323
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,184
是艾略特！

324
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:11,212
艾略特！艾略特！

325
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,258
Man: Elliot, right here.

326
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,089
看这边，艾略特，这边

327
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,251
我爱你，艾略特
Woman: I love you, Elliot!

328
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,594
这是哪裡？
Where are we?

329
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,129
我的小酒吧
Just a little after-hours club I own.

330
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,532
进去，大家在等你
We'd better get in there. Everyone's waiting for you.

331
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,033
哪些人？
Everyone who?

332
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,468
你所有的朋友
All your friends.

333
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,004
你好吗，裡察先生？
How you doing, Mr. Richards?

334
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,402
Elliot, one picture!

335
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,130
嘿，艾略特
- Hey! Hey, Elliot! - No way! This is your club?

336
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,768
不会吧！你的酒吧？
It sure is.

337
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,794
当然是
Wow.

338
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,333
艾略特…

339
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,268
Yeah, baby!

340
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,268
哈囉，艾略特 哈囉
- Hello, Elliot. - Hello.

341
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,508
艾略特，陪我跳舞
- Elliot, dance with me. - No, dance with me.

342
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,146
不，跟我跳
No, he's gonna dance with me first.

343
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,284
他要跟我跳，来啊

344
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,549
闪，他是我的
Okay, girls, that's enough. Break it up. He belongs to me.

345
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,951
艾略特，嗨，谁帮我们照张像
How the hell are you? Somebody take a picture of us.

346
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,954
好极了
- Hold it! - Excellent.

347
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,495
Hi, Elliot.

348
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,802
她也煞到你了
I think she likes you, too.

349
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,803
饿吗？
- Are you hungry? - Uh-huh. Sort of.

350
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,701
有一点
- Look. - Wow!

351
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,499
看
These look just like the cookies my grandma used to make.

352
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,308
好像我祖母烤的饼乾

353
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,242
试试看
- Try one. - Okay.

354
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,177
是我祖母烤的饼乾
These are the cookies that my grandma used to make!

355
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,011
特地讨好你的，帅哥，来吧
I aim to please, handsome. Come on.

356
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,475
How did you...

357
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,821
还喜欢吧？
- You liked that, didn't you? - What, the cookie?

358
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,381
喜欢什麽，饼乾吗？

359
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,655
看到你都很兴奋
Having all those people excited to see you.

360
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,294
受欢迎很爽吧？
It's nice to feel accepted, isn't it?

361
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,728
我可以给你这一切
I can give you that.

362
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,094
让全世界的人爱你
I can make the whole world love you.

363
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,130
得了吧
- Come on! - You still don't believe me, do you?

364
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,836
你还不相信
Of course not!

365
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,999
当然不！第一…

366
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,041
First of all, you look nothing like the devil.

367
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,774
你看起来一点都不像魔鬼

368
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,005
真的？我也可以这样
Oh, really? I suppose I could have gone this way.

369
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,749
可是像万圣节的道具
But it's so trick-or-treat.

370
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,411
是真的！你真的是魔鬼！
It's true!

371
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,804
You really are the devil!

372
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,847
来吧，宝贝，坐下
Oh, come on, baby.

373
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,474
Come and sit down.

374
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,362
我知道这难以置信
I know this has all been horribly overwhelming for you.

375
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,556
可以问个问题吗？
- Can I ask you a question? - Sure, you can.

376
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:36,129
随便问 只要不是「有上帝吗」
You can ask me anything you'd like.

377
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,942
As long as you don't ask me if there's a God.

378
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,099
常有人问这问题，我快疯了
I get that one all the time. It drives me absolutely bonkers.

379
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,466
是的，是有个上帝
Yes, there's a God.

380
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,878
真的？他长相如何？
Really? Well, what's He like?

381
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,745
本以为碰到魔鬼比较好玩
You'd think meeting the devil would be interesting enough,

382
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,577
但所有人都在问他
but all they want to know about is Him!

383
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,715
好像他是妈的万人迷
Like He's so bloody fascinating.

384
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,716
所以他是男的？
- So He's a man? - Yeah.

385
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:56,854
没错
Most men think they're God. This one just happens to be right.

386
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,892
每个男人都自以为是上帝 但，这一位倒是真的

387
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,257
听好，心爱的
Now listen, darling. I don't want to pressure you,

388
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,228
不是我要製造压力 但是，麻烦看一下合约
but why don't we take a teensy little look at the contract?

389
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,939
What the... it's pretty...

390
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,410
本人，艾略特裡察
"I, Elliot Richards, hereafter known as 'the Damned'...

391
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,345
以下简称被诅咒者？

392
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:22,914
被诅咒者又如何？
- "the Damned"? - How about "the Darned"? Better?

393
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,382
可能「咒方」比较好听？

394
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,647
不管这些法律用语，别执著细微字眼
Don't get hung up on the language, darling.

395
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,480
一般法律条文而已
There's nothing sinister here. It's all standard boilerplate.

396
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,414
第一段陈述本人，魔鬼
Paragraph one states that "I, the devil,

397
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:41,933
其非营利事业位于地狱及洛城 将赐给你七个愿望
a nonprofit corporation with offices in purgatory, hell, and L.A.,

398
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,007
will give you seven wishes to use as you see fit."

399
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,800
七个？为什麽不是八个？
Seven? Why not eight?

400
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,369
为什麽不是六个？
Why not six? I don't know. Seven just sounds right.

401
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,030
七听起来正好

402
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,443
第二段主述愿望的代价
Paragraph two outlines the manner in which you'll pay for the wishes.

403
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,447
开玩笑？将灵魂给你？
What? Are you kidding?! I have to give you my soul?

404
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,937
在实现愿望之后
After you've had your wishes, of course.

405
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,473
但是，是我的灵魂！
But it's my soul!

406
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,453
我不能将灵魂给你！
I can't give you my soul!

407
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,114
你是谁啊，詹姆士布朗吗？
What are you? James Brown?

408
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,356
我是说，你看过你的灵魂吗？
What's the big deal? Have you ever seen your soul?

409
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,686
你知道它是啥玩意儿吗？
- Do you even know what it is? - Of course, it's the thing that...

410
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:12,919
当然，它是那种…那种…

411
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:13,965
漂浮在你身边…
No, that's... it floats around...

412
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,990
可以跟你说件事吗？
Can I tell you something?

413
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,902
灵魂的重要性被高估了
Souls are overrated. They don't really do anything.

414
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,403
它无所是事
Has yours done anything for you so far?

415
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,940
你的灵魂为你做过什麽吗？

416
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,967
它就像盲肠，你根本不需要
No, it's like your appendix.

417
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,177
You'll never even miss it.

418
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,482
既然没用，你要它干嘛？
Well, if it's so useless, then why do you want it so much?

419
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,814
你真自以为聪明
Ooh, aren't you the clever one?

420
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,937
Look, who's really making out in this deal here?

421
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,988
这次交易到底谁获利啊？

422
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,456
七个无所不能的愿望
Seven utterly fabulous wishes

423
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,459
换取一个微不足道的灵魂
for one piddling little soul?

424
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,359
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

425
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,794
这是谁啊？
What have we here?

426
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:54,165
谁？爱丽生？
Wait. Who is...

427
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,246
Alison?

428
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,304
你怎麽…？
How did you...

429
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,944
她好美啊
She is so beautiful.

430
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,014
我一直在等你
- I've waited for you for so long. - Who's that?

431
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,777
那是谁？
- I've waited for you for so long. - Who's she with?

432
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:05,846
她跟谁一起？
- I want you now, my love. - Why are you showing me this?

433
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,609
我要你

434
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,420
为何给我看这些？

435
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,991
我喜欢你留那种头髮
Oh, I love your hair like that.

436
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,755
你一定用很多润丝精
You must go through conditioner like crazy.

437
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,826
这是真的吗？
Is this real?

438
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,464
很可能
It could be. All you have to do is sign.

439
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,535
只要你肯签字

440
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,526
可以得到她？
And you promise I'll get her?

441
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,039
由你决定，你可以许愿
That's really up to you. You're the one with the wishes.

442
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,270
我答应全力以赴
But I promise I'll do everything in my power.

443
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,671
签字吧，艾略特
Sign it, Elliot.

444
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,016
签啊

445
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,513
拜託，艾略特，我在等你
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting, Elliot.

446
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:56,558
拜託，艾略特，我在等你呢

447
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,244
好极了！
Great!

448
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,987
许愿之前，先拿著这个
Now before you start wishing, you'll be needing this.

449
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,557
如果事情不依照你的愿望进行
If for any reason your wish isn't going the way you hoped,

450
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:25,222
拿出来拔666 它会带你来找我
just take out the pager, hit 666,

451
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,922
and it'll bring you right back to me.

452
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,897
为什麽会不依照我的愿望进行
Why wouldn't it go the way that I'd hoped?

453
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,569
只是打个比方
I was just throwing that out as a for instance.

454
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,869
每个愿望都会惊天动地
Every wish is gonna be 100 percent fabulous.

455
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,077
许愿后马上就能证明
But you'll find that out as soon as you make one.

456
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,477
要现在许个愿吗？
- So I should make one now? - Well, if you don't mind.

457
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,117
若不介意，我还有事要忙…
I've got places to go,

458
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,314
送些人去受永恆的折磨
people to condemn to an eternity of fiery torment.

459
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,988
好，让我想想…
Okay, let me think.

460
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,626
希望爱丽生嫁给我
- I... I want to be married to Alison. - You got it.

461
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,561
没问题

462
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,789
我想变得很有钱
That's not all. I want to be rich.

463
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,461
大众化的选择
Always a popular choice.

464
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:06,137
不只如此，我要非常有钱有势
That's not all.

465
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,253
I want to be very rich and very powerful.

466
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,138
有过之无不及
Ooh, even better. Remember, you have to say, "I wish."

467
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,833
记得说「我希望」

468
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,074
是的
Right.

469
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,646
我希望…爱丽生嫁给我…
I wish that I were married to Alison

470
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,444
而且非常非常有钱有势
and that I were very, very rich and very powerful.

471
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,650
听起来如何？
- How's that sound? - Sounds good to me.

472
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,108
不成问题，享受吧
Enjoy.

473
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,744
早，先生，来点早餐吗？

474
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,542
对不起，我不会说西班牙话

475
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,751
等等！

476
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,117
我在说西班牙话！

477
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:07,817
哇！我是在说西班牙话

478
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,764
希望我的西班牙语老师听到了

479
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,962
她总是说我拼不出一句话

480
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,567
看来她错了

481
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,239
哈囉！

482
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,775
我爱死了！

483
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,402
我叫艾略特

484
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,142
你好，先生

485
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,781
你好，艾特本，图书馆在哪？

486
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,646
这是我姑妈家

487
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,446
不用，我对有壳海鲜过敏

488
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,289
老闆，你还好吗？

489
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,417
很好，好极了

490
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,352
早餐准备好了

491
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,264
饭后他们希望你去一趟马房

492
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,301
看看新种马

493
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,132
马房？

494
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,466
哦，我的马房！

495
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,005
问问心爱的老婆要不要一起去

496
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:06,596
我的马房！

497
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,686
这匹种马异常勇猛 一看就知道是天生配种好手

498
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,360
你也如此吧？

499
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,197
多神勇的动物！

500
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:32,374
生活多美好啊，各位

501
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,004
Roberto.

502
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,840
我的钱三辈子都花不完

503
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,057
身强体壮

504
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:52,392
有让我一见就心花怒放的爱妻

505
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:03,045
啊，美味

506
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:08,721
她来了，跟拉欧在一起

507
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:12,140
他们一定还在继续上英文课

508
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,498
一定是的

509
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:29,125
对…错不了

510
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,038
心爱的，怎麽了？

511
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:53,186
我只是在想…

512
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,991
英文课上得怎麽样？

513
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:58,390
有进步吗？

514
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,736
很好，说一句给你听....

515
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:07,202
我现在将要去洛杉矶…
"I am is to visiting in the Los Angeles

516
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:10,173
度一些假期时间
for the time of vacations."

517
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:15,223
很好，好极了，心爱的

518
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,264
短短六个月的课…

519
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,660
在拉欧教导下

520
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:28,405
对啊，拉欧教了我好多事情

521
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,854
很好，很好

522
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,246
都好几个月了，老闆

523
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,467
拉欧公然在你眼前偷你老婆

524
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,773
这些你留著，因为我洗了两份

525
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:51,923
两份？

526
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,475
价格不变
"Idioto"!

527
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,455
你怎能如此对我？

528
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:11,014
怎麽会呢，爱丽生？

529
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:14,007
我们结了婚，你觉得无所谓吗

530
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:15,296
回答我！

531
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,450
你想知道事实吗？

532
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:20,528
好吧，我告诉你

533
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:23,644
我看不起你

534
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,623
想到你就觉得厌恶

535
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,725
你每一点我都恨

536
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:37,041
你再碰我，我就吐到死

537
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:39,816
而我会很高兴，因为…

538
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:42,926
我不用再看到你那张噁心的脸

539
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:48,890
我问的是理由

540
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:52,000
出去，滚出去！

541
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,281
老闆，得走了，工厂出了问题

542
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,924
什麽问题？

543
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,257
是帕裡托

544
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,895
他们逮到他偷东西

545
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:10,091
他们搜查他家 在地板裡找到半公斤

546
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,017
半公斤什麽？

547
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:13,995
我们的产品啊

548
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:21,506
你是说我们大老远跑来这… 丛林深处…

549
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:26,784
因为他偷了一磅麵粉还是糖…

550
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,119
到底是什麽？

551
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,160
可卡因！

552
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,787
可卡因！

553
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:39,454
啊，妈的！

554
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:43,418
我是哥伦比亚毒枭

555
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,859
一个有钱有势的哥伦比亚毒枭

556
00:33:50,054 --> 00:33:54,821
老闆，俄国佬来，对货色不满

557
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,162
他们要跟你谈谈

558
00:33:58,062 --> 00:34:02,208
听好，我刚搞懂来龙去脉

559
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:05,502
我很不爽，我连安眠药都不吃

560
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,484
哦，伟大，我连俄语都会讲

561
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:15,280
我们对你的货色非常不满

562
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,751
这个我能理解，但问题是… 我不知道你们会不会把东西…

563
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:23,198
卖给小孩，或在学校附近卖…

564
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:25,691
这点我不放心

565
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,632
老实说

566
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:30,402
我正打算不干了…

567
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,776
女人跑了，现在连种也没了

568
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:38,340
这裡的生意我接手

569
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,857
门都没有，拉欧

570
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:45,069
看看你四周的人

571
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,338
一有危险他们会为我牺牲生命

572
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,766
他们现在是我的人马了

573
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:56,801
我不这麽认为

574
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:01,615
你们同意刚听到的吗？

575
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:05,758
亚力山卓？
Alejandro?

576
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,952
亚力山卓？

577
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:09,159
罗贝托？艾特本？
Roberto? Esteban?

578
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,891
你们这些浑球！

579
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:14,829
干掉他！

580
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,093
你娘卡好！

581
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,701
Mama!

582
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:26,317
我的妈呀！

583
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:36,224
Seis, seis, seis!

584
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:44,795
这麽快就回来？
Back so soon?

585
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:53,247
你把我变成毒枭
You turned me into a drug dealer!

586
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,509
他们差点杀了我！
They almost killed me!

587
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,910
是你要有钱有势的
You asked for rich and powerful.

588
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,240
不是那种
- Not like that. - Goes with the territory, babe.

589
00:36:58,252 --> 00:36:59,651
十全难十美
"Root of all evil." Ring any bells?

590
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:02,256
钱乃万恶源头，听过吧？

591
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:05,157
爱丽生呢？她怎麽了？
But what about Alison? What got into her?

592
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:06,954
可能因为拉欧吧
I think it was Raoul.

593
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,525
那不是我许的愿
Yeah! That's not what I wished for.

594
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:13,598
等等，先生，你只说结婚
Well, hold on now, mister.

595
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,564
You wished that the two of you were married.

596
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:17,271
你没提过她爱不爱你
You didn't say anything about her loving you.

597
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:19,535
两人既然结婚，自然就…
You know, when two people get married, I assume that...

598
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,776
那是你的错
There's your mistake.

599
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:24,142
我可以作个建议吗？
- May I suggest something? - What?

600
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,769
有钱有势不是个好主意
The rich and powerful thing wasn't really the way to go.

601
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:29,784
大家都许这个愿，从来没成功
Everyone wishes for that first thing out of the gate and it never pans out.

602
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:30,682
真的吗？
- Really? - The fact of the matter is

603
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:35,415
事实上，女人不爱钱与势
women aren't really attracted to wealth and power.

604
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,791
是这样吗？
- They're not? - No, of course not.

605
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:40,420
没错，她们甩都不甩
They couldn't give a fig for all that rubbish.

606
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:44,799
要知道哪种男人对她有吸引力
What you need to figure out is what she does want in a man.

607
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,232
要怎麽做？
How do I find that out?

608
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,232
简单
Easy.

609
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:59,176
我跟她没关係！
I'm not with her!

610
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,340
我们在哪裡？
Where are we?

611
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:05,820
没有我你决到不了的地方
Devil: A place you never would have seen without my help.

612
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,811
欢迎光临爱丽生的卧房
Welcome... Alison's bedroom.

613
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,826
不可以，这叫私闯民宅
We can't be in here. This is breaking and entering.

614
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:12,986
我知道，很有趣吧？
I know. It's fun, isn't it?

615
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:16,319
这裡一定可以找到答案
I'm sure we're gonna find the answer somewhere around here.

616
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:19,799
万一爱丽生发现我们？
What if Alison catches us?

617
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,892
别担心，她看不见我们
Don't worry. She won't be able to see you.

618
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,964
再说，她正在洗澡
Besides,

619
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,636
she's in the shower.

620
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,865
一丝不挂，就在门后面
Naked.

621
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:27,972
Right behind that door.

622
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,276
去吧，偷瞄一眼
Go on, go ahead. Take a peep.

623
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,107
不！
No!

624
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:34,348
去啦，你我心照不宣
Oh, come on. We both know you want to.

625
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:36,748
你当我是变态
You must think that I'm really perverted, don't you?

626
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:40,480
你以为我可怜又没人爱
That's what you think.

627
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,359
You think I'm some sad, desperate, twisted, pathetic loser.

628
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:41,856
没错
Yes.

629
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:44,188
既然如此，看一眼也无妨
Well, in that case, maybe I'll just take a quick look.

630
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,224
别忘了正事，艾略特
Focus, Elliot.

631
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,828
我们是来找出她心仪的男人
Remember, we're here to find out what kind of man she wants.

632
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:50,728
怎麽找？
How are we gonna do that?

633
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:53,766
这个嘛，她有写日记
Well, she keeps a journal.

634
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:58,270
找到了，一定有些线索
And here it is!

635
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,669
Right, I should be able to find some information in here that's useful.

636
00:38:58,372 --> 00:39:00,704
嘿，请尊重隐私
Hey, that's private stuff.

637
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,377
隐私个头！听这一段
Is it ever! Listen to this.

638
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:05,845
昨晚真是疯狂
"Last night was the most incredible night of my life.

639
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,543
虽不知姓名，我们回到这裡…
I never did find out any of the guys' names, but I brought them here

640
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:13,217
五个人一起炒饭
and all five banged me like a Salvation Army drum."

641
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:14,889
什麽？给我看！
What?

642
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,618
假的啦，我可以当作家
- Give me that! - Just kidding.

643
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,895
I could have been a writer.

644
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:25,331
没关係，撞到你她也没感觉
Hey, it's okay. She could bump into you and she wouldn't feel it.

645
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,336
这一段很有用
Now this is good.

646
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:33,407
对我有兴趣的迷人男士很多
"I meet many attractive men who are interested in me

647
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:37,343
其中不乏帅气、聪明或成功的
and, while many of them are handsome

648
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,207
or clever or very successful,

649
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:40,847
我发觉我提不起劲
I find myself turning away from them

650
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:44,817
总想找另一个他
and searching the horizon for someone else.

651
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:47,080
不晓得他是谁或是在哪裡
I don't know who he is or where I'll find him.

652
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:51,881
只知道他是个敏感的人
I only know that he is a sensitive man.

653
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:55,293
他能够传达自己的情感
He's a man who's in touch with his emotions.

654
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:59,331
他不怕别人知道自己的恐惧…
He's a man who's not afraid to share his fears,

655
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:02,095
失落甚至伤心落泪
his disappointments, and his tears.

656
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:05,701
我多愁善感的人，你在哪？
'Where are you, my sensitive man?"'

657
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:16,109
看到没？
Did you see that?

658
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,350
她刚穿过我的身体
She passed right through me.

659
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:20,454
在某一微秒中，我们合而为一
We were one person for a split second.

660
00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:22,217
就像「第六感生死恋」
Just like in "Ghost"!

661
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,458
我要到智利赶一场地震
Darling, I've got an earthquake in eight minutes.

662
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,925
想要许愿了吗？
Any chance of making a wish here?

663
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:30,763
要，我希望我…
Yes.

664
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:32,304
I wish I were the most sensitive man in the world.

665
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,321
是世上最敏感的人

666
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,324
好，没问题
Right. Okay.

667
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:39,397
等等，是世上最多愁善感
Wait!

668
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,561
I wish I were the most emotionally sensitive man in the world.

669
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,831
可恶，真希望你没发现语病
Damn, I was hoping you wouldn't catch that.

670
00:40:42,343 --> 00:40:44,106
不然我可乐了
I could have had a lot of fun.

671
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,438
而且要她爱上我
And I want her to love me.

672
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,569
Oh... you know what?

673
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:50,340
知道吗，我预感这次会很棒
I have a great feeling about this.

674
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:51,249
真的吗？
- You do? - Yeah, but...

675
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:54,014
是啊，但我也说不准
what do I know?

676
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:07,834
我回来了，亲爱的
- Hey. - I'm back, my love.

677
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:08,869
你去哪裡？
Where did you run off to?

678
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:14,569
去找梅花帮你做个皇冠
I went to make a garland of beach plums

679
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,263
to place atop your glorious head like a crown.

680
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:20,074
然后我看到夕阳，不知怎的…
But then I caught sight of that sunset and...

681
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,018
I don't know.

682
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:25,375
内心激动不已，忍不住哭起来
Something stirred inside me and I had to stop

683
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,107
and weep.

684
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,752
好美
It's beautiful.

685
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,083
是啊
Yeah, it is.

686
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:35,294
我又要哭了
There I go again.

687
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:36,158
面纸吗？
- Tissue? - No.

688
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:36,897
不用
I never wipe my tears away. I'm not ashamed of them.

689
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:38,421
我从不擦眼泪

690
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:41,493
它不可耻，反而很光荣
I wear them proudly.

691
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:45,861
是小小湿湿咸咸的真感情表徵
Like small, wet, salty badges of emotional truth.

692
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:49,604
艾略特，有件事我们得谈谈
Elliot, there's something that I think we should talk about.

693
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:54,745
我们一起三个多星期了
We've been together for, what, about three weeks now?

694
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,883
三个奇妙的星期
Three magical weeks.

695
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:03,584
三个奇妙的星期，我不曾遇见 像你感情这般丰富的人
Three magical weeks.

696
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,101
I don't think that I've ever met

697
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,686
a man who's been more in touch

698
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:07,382
我多麽爱你啊
- with his feelings. - I love you.

699
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,690
So very much.

700
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:09,794
我也爱你
I love you, too.

701
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:16,062
达利！彼得！
Dudley! Peter!

702
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:18,939
抱歉，它们简直是魔鬼
I'm sorry, they're such little devils.

703
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,237
走啦，顽皮鬼，再见
Come on, you naughty boys. See you.

704
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,036
对不起
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

705
00:42:25,446 --> 00:42:29,815
还好吗？要不要压压惊？

706
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,671
Do you need comforting on any level?

707
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,508
不用，没事
No, no, I'm fine.

708
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:35,945
我有做让你感觉不快的事吗？
Have I done or said anything

709
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,886
to make you feel less good about you?

710
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,924
不，我很好
No, no, I'm fine.

711
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,688
要吃东西吗？我做了综合沙拉
Would you like something to eat?

712
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,225
I made a Salade Nicoise

713
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:44,795
加了不伤海豚法捕获的鱿鱼
with dolphin-safe tuna.

714
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,092
唔…
Oh, wow.

715
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:53,963
怎麽了？
What is it?

716
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:55,976
又是夕阳
It's that sunset again.

717
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:58,536
我也替海豚担心
And I worry about the dolphins.

718
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,414
我为它们写了首歌，要听吗？
I wrote a song about them. Would you like to hear it?

719
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:02,949
现在？我…
Now? I...

720
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:12,493
美乃，美乃滋

721
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:15,053
优游在海边

722
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:17,964
随波浪起舞

723
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,501
海豚，海豚，我的爱

724
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:23,470
不管你何在

725
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:26,438
你绝非只是鱼

726
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:30,534
是我海底戏耍的伴侣

727
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:33,707
我得停下来
- I have to stop. - Good. I mean, oh, why?

728
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,606
很好…我是说为什麽？

729
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:39,452
因为看著你，我看到美丽世界
Because I'm looking at you

730
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,491
and I'm seeing all the beauty of the world

731
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,988
透过你的双眼向我闪耀
shining at me through your eyes.

732
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:43,546
可以把你画下来吗？
Would you mind if I sketched you?

733
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:45,252
我不知道你会画画
I didn't know you could draw.

734
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,994
我不算个画家
I'm not an artist per se.

735
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:51,088
有件事我一定要说
Okay, Elliot, there's something that I think I really have to say.

736
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:57,265
艾略特，太棒了！
Elliot, that's amazing!

737
00:43:57,538 --> 00:43:59,506
跟你比起来不算什麽
Compared to you, it's nothing.

738
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,100
比起你的微笑…
Compared to your smile

739
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:07,047
双颊的红晕，甜美的声音
and the blush of your cheek

740
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,435
and the sound of your voice as it floats on the evening breeze.

741
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:13,816
比起你，夕阳只是…
Compared to you, that sunset's just...

742
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,056
那玩意儿何时才要落下？
when is that darn thing gonna set?

743
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:16,715
或许该走了
- Maybe we should go. - No, wait!

744
00:44:17,057 --> 00:44:18,058
不，等一下
There's so much that I want to say to you,

745
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,685
我有好多话想跟你说

746
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,961
但找不到正确的词摩
but I just can't find the words.

747
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:27,432
我有个主意，来作首十四行诗
I have an idea.

748
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,123
I would like to improvise a sonnet about your hair.

749
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:30,059
讚美你的头髮

750
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:33,802
充满奇妙是我美丽人儿的脸…
How wonderful my fair one's face...

751
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:39,580
抱歉，各位…
Excuse me, fellas.

752
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,311
你们可以去别处玩吗？
Might I ask you to take the horseplay

753
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,680
down to another part of the beach?

754
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,779
哦…不可以
Eh... no.

755
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:57,895
不要怒气衝天，先坐下来…
You know, rather than get confrontational,

756
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,361
why don't we all just sit down together,

757
00:44:58,098 --> 00:45:02,330
吃点鱿鱼沙拉，然后谈谈
have some salad with dolphin-safe tuna

758
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,115
and see if we can't start a dialogue.

759
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:07,198
我觉得你是…
You know, I had a feeling that you were gonna...

760
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:11,373
各位，我不得不要求你们…
Okay, guys.

761
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,041
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you

762
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:15,514
尊重我与女友共享的时光
to respect the moment that my woman friend

763
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,713
and I are sharing, because it's a special celebration

764
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:18,016
因为我们在庆祝爱与关怀
of love and caring

765
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:22,680
以及特别的心灵互通
and a unique spiritual and emotional understanding.

766
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:25,819
要去喝杯啤酒吗？
Do you want to get a beer?

767
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:27,354
好啊
Sure.

768
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:30,461
爱丽生，这是我俩的时间
Alison, excuse me, but I thought that this was our time together.

769
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:32,360
我马上回来
It's just a beer. I'll be back in two seconds.

770
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:35,431
正确说，我家离这儿40分钟
Actually, my place is, like, 40 minutes from here.

771
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:36,933
你的车呢？
That's fine. Which way's your car?

772
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:38,126
是休旅车
- It's a van. - Great.

773
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:38,502
更好
Alison! I respect your uniqueness and your individuality

774
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:44,052
爱丽生，我尊重你的自由意志

775
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,116
and you're your own person.

776
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,430
如果你想跟新朋友走
If you want to go with our new friends here

777
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,132
去喝上一杯，我不会阻止你
to get a drink, I won't stand in your way.

778
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,101
谢谢，我知道你会体谅我
Thanks, Elliot. I knew you'd understand.

779
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:51,693
不，不行走
No, wait! Don't go! Don't go!

780
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:55,106
为什麽你不陪我？
I can't handle this kind of rejection. Why don't you want to stay?

781
00:45:55,106 --> 00:46:01,272
想知道原因吗？你太敏感了！ 我快疯了！
You want to know why, Elliot?

782
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,548
Because you're just too sensitive!

783
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,049
I'm about to go out of my mind!

784
00:46:01,612 --> 00:46:03,614
我爱你，感觉也很棒
It's been wonderful, and God knows I love you,

785
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:05,946
但，我受够了
but enough is enough!

786
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:08,847
我要个不存心讨好我的男人
I just want to be with a man

787
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,112
表面装出对我的想法有兴趣
who'll ignore me and take me for granted,

788
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,893
who's only pretending to be interested

789
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:15,626
事实上他只想扒光我的衣服
in who I am and what I think

790
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,439
so he can get into my pants.

791
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:17,617
那个人就是我
That would be me.

792
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:20,756
多谢，我们走吧
Oh, thank you!

793
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,945
Let's get out of here.

794
00:46:21,632 --> 00:46:23,497
爱丽生，等一下！
Alison? Wait!

795
00:46:24,635 --> 00:46:27,138
爱丽生！
Alison!

796
00:46:27,138 --> 00:46:30,596
我也可以扒光你的衣服啊！
I'll get into your pants!

797
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:50,239
艾略特，小呆瓜，出来啊
Oh, Elliot, get out of there, you silly boy.

798
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:52,480
你好坏！
Man, you are so bad!

799
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,345
多谢讚美，为什麽？
Why, thank you.

800
00:46:54,482 --> 00:46:57,985
你故意用这种瞬间旅行整人
Just admit it.

801
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,148
You're not very good at this whole instant-travel thing, are you?

802
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:01,386
很抱歉，我们说到哪裡？ 哦，下个愿望
I'm sorry. Now then, what were we talking about?

803
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,355
别以为我看不出来
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it?

804
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,654
Don't think I don't see what you're doing.

805
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:07,950
我许愿，然后你设法搞鬼
I make wishes, and you think up ways to ruin them!

806
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:10,259
我搞鬼？
I ruin them?

807
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:14,502
怎能这麽说？我无法面面俱到
How can you say that?

808
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,416
I'm not perfect, you know! Do you think I enjoy this?

809
00:47:14,502 --> 00:47:15,730
你以为我喜欢这样？

810
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,405
我不得不永远做这可怕的工作
I'm stuck in this horrible job for eternity,

811
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:21,406
每个人都恨我！
everybody hates me, I can't sleep,

812
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:24,512
每当我真心想帮助某人时
and when I actually try to help someone,

813
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:26,980
他们总以为我是上帝
they turn on me like I'm supposed to be

814
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:30,916
顺带一提，我简直痛不欲生
God or something!

815
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:31,389
For your information, my life is a living hell!

816
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:34,886
我努力工作！尽力找好你
I work hard! I try to look good for you!

817
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:38,219
你很好，你看起来美极了
You do look good. You look very good.

818
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:40,926
只希望你喜欢我！
I just wanted you to like me!

819
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:44,759
我喜欢你，只是有点挫折
I do like you.

820
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,986
It's just I'm feeling a little frustrated here.

821
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:47,660
别放弃我，我不会放弃你
Don't give up on me, Elliot. I'm not giving up on you.

822
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:50,435
没有人一开始就称心如意
Nobody gets it totally right right away.

823
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:52,836
你做得很好，真的
You're doing great. Really.

824
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,972
是吗？
- I am? - Yeah. You are.

825
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:58,705
是啊，很抱歉你的愿望没实现

826
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,917
I'm so sorry your wish didn't work out.

827
00:48:00,548 --> 00:48:02,550
还是朋友？
Friends?

828
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,279
当然
Sure.

829
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:08,454
抱歉让你不愉快
I'm sorry if I said anything to upset you or make you feel bad.

830
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:11,058
下次我会敏感一点
And I'm gonna try to be more sensitive next time.

831
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,992
我觉得你够敏感了
Oh, I think you're sensitive enough already.

832
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,822
是吗？
- You think? - Are you kidding?

833
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:16,495
是啊，你甚至哭著来找我
You even went for me crying.

834
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,759
嘿，你又在耍我？
Hey! Were you faking me out? Because...

835
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,863
100%真诚
I was 100% sincere.

836
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:24,902
要扮好恶魔并不容易
It's not easy being the Barbra Streisand of evil, you know.

837
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,904
到目前为止学到什麽？
What have we learned so far?

838
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:32,205
女人不知道自己真正要什麽
Well, let's see.

839
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,951
I'm starting to think women really don't know what they want.

840
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,581
阿门！
Amen!

841
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:35,811
口口声声说喜欢多愁善感的人
They say they want sensitivity, but you saw how fast she went

842
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,415
结果爱丽生依然投入猛男怀裡
for those tough dudes on the beach?

843
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:42,249
其中的教训是…
Which tells you?

844
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,294
That...

845
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,092
我要变得又高又壮
well, it tells me that I want to be really big and strong.

846
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:48,425
身材要好，高大，懂吗？
I want to have a great body. Tall and, like,

847
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:49,494
继续
Good. Go on.

848
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,087
我要当运动员
- I want to be athletic. - Check.

849
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:55,034
有钱，但来自我喜欢的工作
And I want to be rich, too.

850
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,475
For something that I like doing and that people really like me for.

851
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:57,093
人们也因为我的工作喜欢我

852
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,038
太好了，非常明确
Great! This is getting really specific.

853
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:02,542
想想看…高大、富有、运动员
Let's see... big, strong, rich, athletic,

854
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,613
你喜欢，又广为风靡
something you like, lots of fans...

855
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,012
你想的跟我一样吗？
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

856
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,581
希望如此
Oh, I hope so.

857
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:10,106
当愿望之一
In the form of a wish?

858
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,119
我希望打职篮
I wish I could play professional basketball!

859
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:15,850
我要作法囉-丹尼斯罗德曼！
Then I'll just say the magic words: Dennis Rodman!

860
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,956
开个玩笑！
- No! - Just kidding!

861
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,186
麦可乔登！
Michael Jordan.

862
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,563
好啊！
Yeah!

863
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:30,001
3！2！ 1！
Crowd: Three... two... one...

864
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,643
比赛结束！球迷们简直疯了…

865
00:49:35,643 --> 00:49:37,838
这场在洛杉矶主场的比赛…
The fans are going nuts here at the Forum in Los Angeles.

866
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,840
最终比数135比85
The score, 135 to 85.

867
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,650
全场完全由艾略特裡察主导
Elliot Richards has totally dominated.

868
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:47,144
这是史上最精彩的比赛之一
If you're just tuning in, it's a shame

869
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,107
because you've missed one of the greatest performances

870
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:49,088
一点都没错，谢利
in the history of sports.

871
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,361
Absolutely, Jerry. Absolutely.

872
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:53,160
大家都说篮球热潮因为…
People say basketball caught fire

873
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,094
麦可乔登的出现而蔓延
with the ascendry of Michael Jordan.

874
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:56,959
看完今晚的比赛
But after what we've seen here tonight,

875
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,667
很多人将说「哪一位麦可？」
a lot of people are gonna be saying, "Michael who?"

876
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:04,570
有女球迷看到艾略特就昏倒了
Jerry: Right from the get-go,

877
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,375
the fans took a look at Elliot Richards

878
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:06,640
有几位男士也是-我最好别说
and a few women fainted

879
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,087
and a few fellas, well, I'd rather not say,

880
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:08,608
但他们显然也相当激动
but they liked what they saw.

881
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:10,610
他真是个魁梧的大傢伙
Lamar: Absolutely. He's a big fella and an imposing fella.

882
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:12,009
相当惊人
Jerry: He's enormous. He's listed at 7'6" in the program,

883
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,545
记录上他身高七英尺六寸

884
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:17,480
打起球来感觉有十一英尺高
but I say he plays, like you said, 11 feet tall.

885
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:19,550
太夸张了，谢利
No, I don't think he's that big, Jerry.

886
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:25,648
我是说他打球时像个北海巨人
No, I'm saying the game he plays is

887
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,230
that of some Viking giant

888
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:28,526
右手运球左手执矛
with a basketball in one hand and a club in the other

889
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:31,164
足足有十二英尺高
and standing 10, 11, 12 feet tall!

890
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:35,294
从开球起艾略特就掌控全局
Lamar: It's obvious that Elliot Richards

891
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,740
will control this game from the tip-off.

892
00:50:35,703 --> 00:50:39,707
一开始就是整晚的灵魂人物
Jerry: Right from the get-go,

893
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,911
Elliot is a dominating force in tonight's game.

894
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:44,269
他是纵横全场的灌篮高手
Lamar: He was "phi-slamma-jamma," rubbing stink all over him

895
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,714
跳头就像旱地拔葱
with rib-tickling jumps of double-vanilla funk.

896
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:50,081
看一下，传球简直就是四分卫
Jerry: Let's take a look. Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.

897
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,481
灌篮！漂亮
Lamar: For the dunk! Just a beautiful play.

898
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,987
三分线外，清凉到底，正点！
Here he is lining up for the 3, and, Ricola, it's good.

899
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:01,683
专利的背后过肩三分球
Jerry: Here comes his patented, over-the-shoulder,

900
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:03,993
空心进网！
no-look three-pointer.

901
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,560
And nothing but net.

902
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,606
Dick Vitale: They got the rhythm tonight.

903
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,317
They're in the zone.

904
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:15,868
又来了，空中飞人起飞
Lamar: Here he is soaring through the air

905
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,114
like a man on a flying trapezius.

906
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:19,735
碰！这就是我说的力道
Bam! That's what I'm talking about!

907
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:22,750
篮板毁了，真是头野兽
Destroying the backboard and the glass!

908
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,752
再看一次
- This kid's an animal. - Jerry: Let's take another look.

909
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:29,121
轰！无坚不摧！
Lamar: And boom!

910
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,668
Humpty-hump, dump-dump!

911
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:32,419
醉人的比赛，各位
I love this game, folks. I sure enough do!

912
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,422
过瘾！艾略特口吐玻璃
Elliot Richards spitting glass at your ass!

913
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:38,265
鲍伯正要访问艾略特，鲍伯？
Bob is courtside with Elliot Richards now. Bob?

914
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:39,266
多谢谢利和丹
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.

915
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,564
艾略特，你一定感到很骄傲
Elliot, you must be one very proud young man this evening.

916
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:45,569
今晚真是惊人的演出
Simply put, that was a staggeringly dramatic display of athletic ability.

917
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:49,607
上场就是要尽110%的力气
Well, you know, you go out there

918
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,678
你要好好表现，你想好好表现
and you give 110% and you want to play good.

919
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,652
You hope you play good. I think we played pretty good tonight.

920
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,714
我想我们表现很好

921
00:51:54,782 --> 00:51:57,785
查遍运动专有名词，「好」
In sports terminology... and I don't mean to sound contrary here...

922
00:51:57,785 --> 00:52:03,587
根本不足以形容你精湛的演出
the word "good" falls short of encompassing the sheer virtuosity

923
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:08,455
球队中「我」是不存在的
of your performance this evening.

924
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:08,541
Um, well, you know, there's no "I" in the word "team"

925
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,161
这是团队表现
and this is a team effort, and I want to say I'm proud

926
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:17,805
很荣幸有那麽多优秀的队友

927
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:15,507
to be associated with these fine individuals

928
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,967
that I have had the pleasure of working with.

929
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:20,296
我不是看扁你的队友
I would never want to dis your teammates, but you realize that

930
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,400
但，你知道吗？你打破了…

931
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,675
张伯伦单场100分的记录
you smashed Wilt Chamberlain's record of 100 points in a game

932
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:28,179
多年来它牢不可破
set in Hershey, Pennsylvania, all those years ago?

933
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:32,183
一步一脚印，110%的付出
Oh, man, you just gotta play one game at a time and give 110%.

934
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,322
该来的自然会来
You gotta show you want it more than they do when the chips fall.

935
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:38,382
谢谢，将现场还给谢利和丹
Thank you very much. Back to you, Jerry and Dan.

936
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,487
加油！魔鬼队！
All right! Diablos!

937
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:43,797
一流队伍，对吧！
Number one, yeah!

938
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,962
嗨，艾略特
Elliot. Hi.

939
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:53,340
爱丽生嘉纳，体育週刊
Alison Gardner.

940
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,276
你好，小姐
"The Sporting News."

941
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,465
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

942
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:59,847
见到你好紧张
God, I can't tell you how thrilled I am to meet you.

943
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:05,149
能不能做个专访
I was wondering if there was a possibility

944
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,598
if you might consider doing something exclusive with me

945
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,842
刊登在我们杂志
for the magazine.

946
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:12,417
或许更进一步，一对一单挑
You know, maybe more intimate, one-on-one.

947
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,146
Just the two of us.

948
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,487
只怕我把你拆散了，一对一
Yeah, right, I'd kill you one-on-one!

949
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,887
哇靠！
Shoot!

950
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,767
天啊，好兴奋
God, it's so exciting to be here. I mean...

951
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:26,966
你一定有巨大的…天赋

952
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,119
you must have an enormously huge

953
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,580
talent to do what you do.

954
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:32,880
只要110%的付出
Well, you know,

955
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,500
you go out there and you just give 110%.

956
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,180
你想好好表现，你要好好表现
And...

957
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,297
you hope you play good. And you want to play good.

958
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:38,749
我想我们表现很好
I think we played pretty good.

959
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,389
你今晚表现令人难忘，看著你
God, you were incredible tonight.

960
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:47,258
忍不住幻想，你那硕大的…
Watching you... I just kept thinking how unbelievably big

961
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,933
your ego must be after a game like that.

962
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:49,191
自我在赛后会有多高涨

963
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,886
没那麽伟大，真的
Well, not that big, really.

964
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,388
打赌一定相当大
I bet it's pretty big.

965
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,494
有大一点吧
Well, it gets a little bit bigger.

966
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,200
那得看我有多高兴囉
It depends on how happy I am!

967
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:02,637
哇赛

968
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,814
要不要到我那看我收集的瓶盖
Want to go back to my place? I'll show you my bottle cap collection.

969
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,885
一定多得惊人
Oh, God, that would... that would be tremendous.

970
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:14,387
还好啦
All right! Well...

971
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:16,286
我换件衣服
I should... I should get dressed.

972
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:18,687
我等不及了
I can't wait.

973
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:27,434
天啊！
Oh, my God!

974
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:30,631
嘿，搞什麽？

975
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:34,032
那是，那是…
Hey! What the hell?

976
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:39,879
干！他妈的！
- God, there's this... - Hey!

977
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,483
Damn!

978
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,109
Oh, heck!

979
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:45,146
我想起一件小事还没做
Oh, God, I remembered there's

980
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,198
this teeny, tiny thing to do.

981
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:46,885
什麽鸟事？
- What's teeny? - No, no.

982
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,285
要写点东西
- Just something I have to write. - About me?

983
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,456
关于我？
Yeah, just a little, short, itty-bitty blurb

984
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:53,722
是，有关今晚短短小小的报导

985
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,395
回合赛后可以见个面吗？
about tonight's game.

986
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,334
Well, can I see you after the road trip?

987
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,124
当然可以，可是…
I would love to, but I'm working on

988
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:03,368
有个足盟的大报告要赶…
a really big, huge, enormous story on the NFL,

989
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,438
可能没时间
so I probably won't have time.

990
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:10,205
我懂，要110%的付出
Shoot, I understand.

991
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,348
- You gotta give 110%. - Right.

992
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,444
专心不二
- Stay within yourself. - Hey, go, yeah.

993
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,480
是啊，唔…
Hey, um... thanks for your time.

994
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,608
感谢你拔冗接见

995
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:20,078
再见
So long.

996
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,192
Oh!

997
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:22,853
搞什麽鬼？
What the hell?!

998
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,426
死魔鬼，咒你下地狱！
Oh, damn the devil!

999
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,408
Damn the devil to hell!

1000
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:32,625
操！我放哪去了？
Shoot! Darn it!

1001
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,954
Where the heck did I put that?

1002
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,406
5-5-5.

1003
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,171
7-7-7.

1004
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,416


1005
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,649
猪啊，66…

1006
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,026
这会儿你在干嘛？
Now what are you doing?

1007
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:02,052
你很激动，要不要放鬆一下？
You seem so upset, Elliot.

1008
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,942
Do you want me to give you something to help you relax?

1009
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:06,533
是很激动，你给我只小鸡鸡
You bet I'm upset.

1010
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,738
You gave me this little, teeny-weeny winkie.

1011
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,728
小事一嘉
Well, that's easily fixed, you know.

1012
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:13,540
唔…这是323房的巧克力
Now then, let's see.

1013
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,661
There's some M&M's for room 320.

1014
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,474
红色司迪麦是316房的
Red Hots for 316.

1015
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,009
你给病患糖果？
You're giving them candy?

1016
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:20,946
当成药就跟真药一样，有效的
Placebos. They work as well as the real thing.

1017
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,711
It's a scientific fact.

1018
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,040
你不能给病人吃口味儿！
You can't give sick people Tic Tacs.

1019
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:27,316
病人多口臭，我是做社会服务
Sick people have notoriously bad breath.

1020
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,801
I'm performing a public service here.

1021
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:31,046
下个愿望是…
Now then, about your next wish.

1022
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,053
好吧，我想想…
All right, okay.

1023
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,768
Well...

1024
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:40,056
我要精明，不，是真正聪明
I want to be smart.

1025
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:43,798
我要口若衔河，悬河
No, I want to be really smart.

1026
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,608
I want to be able to talk good. "Well."

1027
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,060
那句成语怎麽说？
What's the word?

1028
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:46,061
出口成章？
Articulate?

1029
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:48,735
出口成章！我要能出口成章
Articulate! Yeah, I want to be articulate.

1030
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:52,568
我要机智、世故、迷人
And I want to be witty and sophisticated.

1031
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,343
无所不知，无所不晓
Charming. I want to know everything about everything

1032
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:58,847
受欢迎和帅气
and I want to be popular.

1033
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,998
I want to be good-looking.

1034
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,519
最后一项改成大帅哥！
No, no, make that great-looking!

1035
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:04,045
我要爱丽生疯狂的爱我
And I want Alison to fall head over heels in love with me.

1036
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,592
还有吗？
Anything else?

1037
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:07,116
比如说？
Like what?

1038
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,596
比如说鸡鸡呢？
Like winkiewise?

1039
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:11,188
对哦
Oh, right.

1040
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:18,605
唔…我要…大一点
Yeah, well,

1041
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,810
I want to be big.

1042
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:24,305
不是大得很可笑，你知道…
Not like practical-joke big,

1043
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,606
but, you know, sort of...

1044
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,045
对，清楚了吧？
yeah, like that. Is that clear?

1045
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,877
一清二楚，只管说「我希望」
Crystal. You just say "I wish" and I'll fill in the rest.

1046
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,778
其他包在我身上

1047
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,122
我希望我机智、出口成章…
I wish that I was witty and articulate...

1048
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:37,852
等等等…没问题，天才
Blah, blah, blah.

1049
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,621
You got it, smarty-pants.

1050
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:42,152
吃两颗，明天再连络
Take two of these and call me in the morning.

1051
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,947
哦，艾略特！
Woman: Oh! Elliot!

1052
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:04,041
真高兴见到你，心爱的
Oh, it is so wonderful to see you, darling!

1053
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:11,480
少了你纽约真无聊，去哪了？
New York has been so deadly dull without you.

1054
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:14,426
各汉普顿，专心写书
Where have you been?

1055
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,490
Out in the Hamptons, of course. Up to my ears in my new book.

1056
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:18,430
又一本？三年写四本了
What, another one?

1057
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,703
You've written four books in three years.

1058
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:19,760
这本写些什麽？
- What's this one about? - Oh, same old, same old.

1059
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,401
老题材，经由工业革命的视角

1060
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,417
A deconstruction of the neoromantic period in art and literature

1061
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:27,769
批判解构新浪漫主义时期
from the political and economic perspective

1062
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,379
of the Industrial Revolution in France, England, and Germany.

1063
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:30,340
真不晓得谁会去读？
I can't imagine who reads this stuff!

1064
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:34,514
显然只有文评家会读，艾略特
Well, Elliot, the critics, apparently.

1065
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:37,779
得了普立兹奖但尚未出版
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize

1066
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,556
and it hasn't even been published yet.

1067
00:58:38,518 --> 00:58:40,486
欧林基基代德基基代巴巴博士
Like they say, Dr. Ngegitigegitibaba,

1068
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,148
普立兹奖加三块半换杯拉铁
a Pulitzer Prize and $3.50 will get you a caffe latte.

1069
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:46,287
你太谦虚了
So modest.

1070
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:49,860
你该走走，每个人都想见你
Darling, you really should get around.

1071
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,569
Everyone's dying to see you. Mingle.

1072
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:00,040
你气色真好，瓦希里密西卡
Darling, you look fabulous. Vassily Mishka?

1073
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,406
好迷人的男人，他是谁？
What a charming man. Who is that?

1074
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:06,137
艾略特裡察，大作家
Oh, that's Elliot Richards.

1075
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,417
He's a very successful writer.

1076
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:09,242
事实上是全能大师
He's a very successful everything, as a matter of fact.

1077
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,348
他是艾略特裡察？
That's Elliot Richards?

1078
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:15,043
他的书我全读了
Oh, I've read all his books. He's brilliant.

1079
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,853
很有见地，没想到人那麽帅
I had no idea he was so handsome.

1080
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:19,059
过去跟他聊聊
Why don't you go and talk to him?

1081
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,424
要说什麽？
- I couldn't. What would I say? - Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

1082
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,496
别担心，他会滔滔不绝

1083
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,395
Just let him do all the talking.

1084
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:30,070
人们误以为琴酒来自日内瓦
It's a common misapprehension

1085
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:36,600
事实上，日内瓦原意香矮树 法国人称之「杜松」
that the word "gin" comes from the city Geneva.

1086
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,695
But the word "geneva," small "g," is a corruption of genievre,

1087
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:36,781
which is French for "juniper,"

1088
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:41,537
杜松子是这酒神奇香气的来源
the wonderful berry that flavors this miraculous libation.

1089
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:44,584
说到神奇…
Speaking of miraculous.

1090
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:46,950
在下艾略特裡察，请指教
I'm Elliot Richards. How do you do?

1091
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:51,387
久仰大名，小女子爱丽生嘉纳
I know who you are.

1092
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,545
I'm Alison Gardner.

1093
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:55,857
大作「永远的永恆」 我爱不释手
I just had to tell you how much I loved your novel

1094
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:59,361
只是提出一个简单的观点
"Always Toujours."

1095
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,387
Well, I was just trying to make a simple point, really.

1096
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,102
每次重读卡谬汉沙特
Every time I've reread Camus and Sartre,

1097
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,127
我总会沉思…
I kept thinking to myself,

1098
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:08,608
存在主义困境非得那麽旅迫吗
"Why does the existential dilemma

1099
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,647
- have to be so damned bleak?" - Yes.

1100
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:11,543
没错，我们孤单单活在宇宙中
Yes, we're alone in the universe.

1101
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,943
生命缺乏意义，死亡无可避免
Yes, life is meaningless, death is inevitable.

1102
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,116
但，就因此怀忧丧志吗？
But is that necessarily so depressing?

1103
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:18,414
非常同意
I couldn't agree more.

1104
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,122
你不嚮往入世人性主义吗？
Don't you think secular humanism is yummy?

1105
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,317
哦，令人垂涎
Oh, delish.

1106
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:34,464
哇，舒服
My, my.

1107
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:36,636
人们说酒精令人放谊
They say alcohol is a disinhibitor,

1108
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:38,536
看来在我身上起作用了
and it's working very well on me.

1109
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:40,936
我也是
Me, too.

1110
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:45,202
多麽微妙的感觉
What an exquisite feeling.

1111
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:50,446
体内每个细胞都跃跃欲试
Every cell in my body just...

1112
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,646
wants to reach out and touch someone.

1113
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,619
很奇妙，不是吗？
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?

1114
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:59,387
生物物理的渴求
The physiology of touch.

1115
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:04,323
在皮下流动，集中于指尖…
Just below your epidermis,

1116
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:04,910
concentrated in your fingertips,

1117
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:07,929
…手掌…
palms of your hands,

1118
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:10,932
…脚底…
soles of your feet,

1119
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:12,672
…阴蒂…
clitoris,

1120
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,197
…乳头，阴茎…
nipples, penis,

1121
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:19,111
…嘴唇，舌头
lips,

1122
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,216
tongue.

1123
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,681
成千上万末梢神经元…
Thousands of tiny little Meissner's corpuscles

1124
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:25,447
即使最细微的爱抚也令人悸动
all deliciously sensitive to even the slightest caress,

1125
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:30,782
不断送出刺激恩多芬的讯息
sending all those tiny little endorphin-producing

1126
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:34,694
至脑下垂体
pleasure messages to the hypothalamus...

1127
01:01:34,694 --> 01:01:36,719
那原始的大脑
the primitive brain.

1128
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:39,392
我全身毛细孔都竖起来了
I'm tingling all over.

1129
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,863
你猜人体最大的器官是什麽？
Do you know the largest organ in the human body?

1130
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,706
猜得到
- I can guess. - You'd be wrong.

1131
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:49,504
你一定猜错

1132
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:51,734
是你的皮肤
It's your integumentary system.

1133
01:01:52,712 --> 01:01:54,907
你那…
Your creamy,

1134
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:57,115
…凝脂般…

1135
01:01:57,217 --> 01:02:00,220
…柔软…
soft,

1136
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,087
…涨满慾望的皮肤
and completely desirable skin.

1137
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,987
可以去你家吗？
- Can we go to your place? - For something more?

1138
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,660
求之不得

1139
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:17,202
太完美了
Oh, this is so perfect!

1140
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:21,731
每件东西都呼喊著你的名字
Everything here absolutely screams

1141
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:25,507
事实上，大部分呼喊…
Elliot Richards.

1142
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,908
Actually, most of the screaming

1143
01:02:25,745 --> 01:02:29,545
…都来自…
takes place...

1144
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:32,741
…卧房
in the bedroom.

1145
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:45,492
怎麽回事，玛丽？
What the hell is going on, Mary?

1146
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,200
你是谁？
- Who are you? - Don't play games with me,

1147
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,896
我没心情玩游戏，裡察先生
Mr. Richards. I'm in no mood.

1148
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:54,240
我整晚心神不宁
I've been out of my mind all night.

1149
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:56,571
哦，天啊
- Oh, my God. - Hi.

1150
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:58,209
嗨
Who's your little friend?

1151
01:02:58,278 --> 01:02:59,506
这位小朋友是谁？

1152
01:02:59,779 --> 01:03:01,781
或许我该走了
Maybe I should be running along.

1153
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:03,749
这是一场误会，我不是同性恋
Wait. This is a mistake. I'm not gay.

1154
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:08,015
是吗？那我岂不是泰森！
Oh, really? And I'm Tony Danza.

1155
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,119
发誓，我不是
Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.

1156
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,817
告诉我百老汇「睡衣游戏」 卡司有哪些人？
Well, then tell me,

1157
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,665
who was in the Broadway cast of "The Pajama Game"?

1158
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,785
詹尼斯派吉、约翰雷特
Janis Paige, John Raitt, Eddie Foy, Jr...

1159
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:18,696
小艾迪佛伊，这是原始卡司
I assume you mean the original cast

1160
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:20,425
1973年改由哈尔林登
because there was a revival in 1973 with Hal Linden...

1161
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,131
和芭芭拉麦内尔担网-
I am gay!

1162
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:23,803
我是同性恋！

1163
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:25,395
检方侦查终结
I rest my case.

1164
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:27,966
我可以证明我不是同性恋
Wait. I can prove to you that I am not gay.

1165
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:30,139
吻我
Kiss me.

1166
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,437
何必作贱自己
Oh! This is just sad.

1167
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:34,370
闭嘴，贱人！
Will you shut up, bitch?

1168
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:37,180
爱丽生，拜託让我吻你
Please, Alison, let me kiss you.

1169
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:40,411
记得香槟和末梢神经吗？
Remember the champagne, the corpuscles?

1170
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,482
好吧，艾略特，吻我
All right, Elliot, kiss me.

1171
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:56,358
我是同性恋，多谢光临
I'm gay.

1172
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:58,326
晚安
- Well, thanks for dropping by. - Good night.

1173
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,364
拜拜
Buh-bye.

1174
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:04,401
你又喝酒了，对吗？
You've been drinking again, haven't you?

1175
01:04:04,844 --> 01:04:10,350
跟上次喝醉后在火岛狂奔一样
This is just like the night

1176
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,886
you had all those Brandy Alexanders

1177
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:14,116
只穿小泳裤高唱「长青树」
and ran up and down Fire Island

1178
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,849
with your cute little Speedos, singing "Evergreen" at the top...

1179
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:18,654
于是乳牛又重回主人手裡
Devil: And so the cow was returned to its rightful owner.

1180
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:20,860
好啦，今晚的作业
Okay, boys,

1181
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,067
tonight's homework. Algebra.

1182
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:24,295
代数，X的N次方
Xn + Yn = Zn.

1183
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:26,888
加Y的N次方等于Z的N次方

1184
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,232
这永远用不上
Well, you're never gonna use that, are you?

1185
01:04:30,403 --> 01:04:33,497
「帝国主义与一次世界大战」
Imperialism and the First World War.

1186
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:36,501
覆水难收，多想无益
What was done is done. No point thinking about it now.

1187
01:04:38,411 --> 01:04:39,913
德文、法文、西班牙文
German, French, Spanish.

1188
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:43,212
唯唯、诺诺、是是，废话连篇
Ja, ja, oui, oui, sí, sí. It's nonsense.

1189
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,145
反正每个人都说英语
Everyone speaks English anyway.

1190
01:04:45,418 --> 01:04:47,386
不会的也应该会
And if they don't, they ought to.

1191
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:49,980
所以今晚没有作业！
So, no homework tonight.

1192
01:04:52,425 --> 01:04:55,826
记得多看电视多打电动
But I want you to watch a lot of television,

1193
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:57,556
明天早上见
don't neglect your video games,

1194
01:04:57,931 --> 01:05:02,732
十点半好了，反正早起无益
and I'll see you in the morning.

1195
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,397
Shall we say 10:00, 10:30?

1196
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,232
No point in getting up too early, is there?

1197
01:05:10,443 --> 01:05:12,206
艾略特，心爱的
Elliot, darling.

1198
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:16,905
好一个惊喜，昨晚愉快吗？
What a lovely surprise!

1199
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,954
I hope you had a pleasant evening.

1200
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,611
别一副不知情的样子
As if you didn't know.

1201
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:22,444
对不起，你一定很挫折
I'm sorry, darling.

1202
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,626
I know it must be really frustrating for you.

1203
01:05:22,455 --> 01:05:23,979
我会设法补偿你
Maybe I can make it up to you somehow.

1204
01:05:24,457 --> 01:05:27,984
是啊，你还真帮了大忙！
Yeah, you've been a really big help so far.

1205
01:05:28,461 --> 01:05:30,895
我知道，我很调皮吧？
I know. I've been really naughty, haven't I?

1206
01:05:31,464 --> 01:05:33,898
准备好好让你爽一爽了
Maybe a good spanking's in order.

1207
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,936
你以为性就是一切
Is that all you think about? Do you think everything is about sex?

1208
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,165
当然不是，还有…
No, of course not.

1209
01:05:39,472 --> 01:05:41,474
贪婪、贪吃、懒惰
I mean, there's greed, gluttony, sloth, anger, vanity, envy.

1210
01:05:41,474 --> 01:05:43,203
愤怒、虚荣、忌妒

1211
01:05:43,476 --> 01:05:49,312
还有诚实、努力、关怀 行善助人
No, there's also honesty and hard work

1212
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:49,862
and caring about people and doing good for somebody else.

1213
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:54,078
你是童子军吗？
Oh, you're just a big Boy Scout, aren't you?

1214
01:05:54,487 --> 01:05:56,785
我觉得很感人
I find that incredibly appealing.

1215
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,151
不，我所做的都只想到自己
No. All I've been doing is thinking about myself.

1216
01:05:59,492 --> 01:06:02,996
我可以帮助别人的
I could be doing all these really important things

1217
01:06:02,996 --> 01:06:03,963
那爱丽生怎麽办？
to help other people.

1218
01:06:03,997 --> 01:06:07,592
不晓得，都被你搞乱了
What about Alison?

1219
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:08,088
Oh, I don't know anymore. You mess it up anyway.

1220
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:10,094
我知道爱丽生不是那种人
I know that Alison's not really like that.

1221
01:06:10,503 --> 01:06:13,370
心裡有什麽想法？
What exactly do you have in mind?

1222
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:15,997
我要对人类有所贡献
I want to do something great for mankind.

1223
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:18,011
让世界更美好
I want to create a better world.

1224
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:22,243
我要举足轻重
I want to go down in history for doing something really important

1225
01:06:22,515 --> 01:06:25,382
我要爱丽生尊重我
and I want Alison to take me really seriously

1226
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,148
and to treat me with respect.

1227
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:28,214
我觉得你要许愿了
I sense a wish coming on.

1228
01:06:30,523 --> 01:06:31,990
是的！
Yes!

1229
01:06:34,027 --> 01:06:37,326
我希望成为美国总统
I wish

1230
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,702
that I was the President of the United States.

1231
01:06:39,532 --> 01:06:43,093
这是最高贵最无我的心愿
That is the noblest,

1232
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,249
most unselfish thing I've ever heard.

1233
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:46,938
也是吸引女人的妙招
And it's a great way to meet girls.

1234
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,701
祝福你，艾略特裡察
Bless you, Elliot Richards,

1235
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:53,809
希望此行成果丰硕
and Godspeed.

1236
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:58,882
总统先生，爱丽生嘉纳
Mr. President!

1237
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:03,215
很荣幸您大驾光临
Alison Gardner.

1238
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,726
We're so honored to have you here, sir.

1239
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,654
不，不，不，不
No, no, no.

1240
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:15,632
演员们既紧张又兴奋
The actors are beside themselves with excitement.

1241
01:07:16,068 --> 01:07:17,401
我们要去看舞台剧？
We're going to a play?

1242
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,267
我想你会发现它很有趣
I think you'll find it quite amusing.

1243
01:07:19,574 --> 01:07:22,304
很精彩的，剧名「美国侄儿」
It's called "Our American Cousin."

1244
01:07:22,379 --> 01:07:24,939
你可知,我已经看过了 我敢肯定, 我有
You know, I think I've seen it. As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.

1245
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,817
一定没看过，是新戏
I don't think you've seen it, sir.

1246
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:30,504
- It's an entirely new play. - Really? I think I know how it ends.

1247
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:31,230
我知道它的结局

1248
01:07:31,588 --> 01:07:32,520
不能去看电影吗？
- Say, can we just go to a movie? - A what?

1249
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:33,417
什麽？
Man: The president.

1250
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,453
向总统致意

1251
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,891
总统先生，您好像很紧张
You seem tense tonight, Mr. President.

1252
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:49,534
哎，国事如麻…
Oh, well, you know, I've had a lot on my mind,

1253
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,575
要维持国家统一
what with preserving the Union and my wife going crazy and all.

1254
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,269
又要避免第一夫人发疯

1255
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:00,183
阁下，需不需要帮忙找
Can I help you find something, Mr. President?

1256
01:08:00,517 --> 01:08:02,810
我在找传呼机
Yeah, I'm looking for my pager.

1257
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,979
找什麽，阁下？
- Your what, sir? - My pager.

1258
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:07,324
传呼机，小小红色的…
It's this little red plastic thingy.

1259
01:08:07,724 --> 01:08:11,427
塑胶製品，比手机小一点
It looks kind of like a cell phone, only smaller.

1260
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:15,429
抱歉！抱歉！
I'm sorry! Sorry!

1261
01:08:19,035 --> 01:08:20,900
没问题，不要紧！
All right, no problem.

1262
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:23,700
不要紧，不要紧
No problem! No problem! No problem.

1263
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:26,809
暴君下场皆如此！
- Sic semper tyrannis. - Wait!

1264
01:08:26,844 --> 01:08:28,539
等一下！

1265
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:31,678
好了
Okay.

1266
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:49,855
你迟到了
You're late, Richards.

1267
01:08:49,867 --> 01:08:52,461
对不起，下次不会了
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry. It won't happen again.

1268
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,428
最好不会
See that it doesn't.

1269
01:08:54,872 --> 01:09:00,878
以你有限的才智，最好别再犯
I don't think a person with your extremely limited

1270
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,384
personal-professional skills can afford to push the envelope.

1271
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:02,573
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1272
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:06,611
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

1273
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:15,949
你娘咧
Creep.

1274
01:09:17,394 --> 01:09:19,885
怎麽样？我好想知道
So tell me, how was it? I'm dying to know.

1275
01:09:20,397 --> 01:09:22,262
你在这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1276
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,094
就当我是电脑病毒
Just think of me as a computer virus.

1277
01:09:24,401 --> 01:09:26,494
我当你是瘟疫！
I think of you as a plague.

1278
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:29,770
不要佔住萤幕，我要工作
Now will you get off my screen? I have work to do.

1279
01:09:30,908 --> 01:09:33,911
少来这套「消失吧」把戏
Whoa, what's this whole "get thee behind me" thing?

1280
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:36,175
我们还有正事要办
We still have business here, Mr. Richards.

1281
01:09:36,413 --> 01:09:41,112
我要上班，再说只剩两个愿望
No, not now. I told you, I've got work to do.

1282
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,468
And besides, I've only got two wishes left

1283
01:09:41,418 --> 01:09:42,419
我不想搞砸
- and I don't want to screw them up. - Correction.

1284
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:45,354
更正，只剩一个
You have one wish left.

1285
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,267
Nice try.

1286
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:49,688
别呃我，还有两个

1287
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:51,952
不对，算算看，宝贝
- I've got two more coming. - No. Count them, baby.

1288
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,431
当美国总统
- You were President of the US. - Yeah, okay, one.

1289
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:55,796
对，一个

1290
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:59,664
迷人帅气广受敬重的作家
You were a charming, handsome, articulate,

1291
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,903
celebrated author and raconteur.

1292
01:09:59,937 --> 01:10:03,338
再把我变成无可救药的同性恋
Yeah, and you turned me into a flaming homosexual.

1293
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,441
职篮球员
- Professional basketball player. - Three.

1294
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:04,930
三个
The sensitive, caring, artistic guy was four.

1295
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:07,945
敏感关爱的艺文人士，四

1296
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:10,311
哥国毒枭-五，还有两个
And the Colombian drug lord was five.

1297
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:12,312
你忘了巨无霸与可乐
- That means I have two more coming. - You forgot the Big Mac and Coke.

1298
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,451
什麽？那不算愿望
- What? That wasn't a wish. - What do you call it?

1299
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:17,477
你说「我希望」，我也办到了
You said, "I wish," and I got it for you. Sounds like a wish to me.

1300
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:18,956
对我来说是个愿望
No! No, no, no, no. That's not fair.

1301
01:10:18,956 --> 01:10:21,390
不不不，不公平

1302
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:24,154
公平？你以为你跟谁打交道？
Fair? Who do you think you're talking to?

1303
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:27,157
没有人指控过我公平
I don't recall anybody ever accusing me of being fair before.

1304
01:10:27,965 --> 01:10:28,465
我被污辱了
- I think I'm insulted. - What? You can't...

1305
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:30,933
不对，你不能这麽做
no, this isn't right! You can't do this!

1306
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:32,958
你能怎麽办？告我？
What are you gonna do? Sue me?

1307
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,330
不！我受够了
No! That's it!

1308
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,441
I've had it with you!

1309
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:40,534
整个交易取消！
The whole deal is off.

1310
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,611
Off!

1311
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:43,469
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1312
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,097
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

1313
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:05,636
不太好

1314
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:03,800
Not really.

1315
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,501
我得跟上帝谈谈
I need to talk to God.

1316
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:12,097
你得用祷告，说出你的心声
Well, that's the power of prayer.

1317
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,976
Just say what's in your heart and He hears.

1318
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:12,938
他会听到的
No, you don't understand.

1319
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:16,806
你不懂，我真的得跟他谈

1320
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,230
I really need to talk to Him.

1321
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,150
而且很急
Now. It's urgent.

1322
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,845
可以跟我说吗？
Is it something you can tell me?

1323
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:25,417
不，是私事
No, it's personal.

1324
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,522
没什麽我不懂的事
There's nothing you could say that I wouldn't understand.

1325
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,994
Um...

1326
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,186
试试看嘛
Why don't you just try me?

1327
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,167
我将灵魂卖给魔鬼换七个愿望
Okay, a few days ago,

1328
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,334
I sold my soul to the devil for seven wishes.

1329
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,431
我许过五个愿，但魔鬼说六个
I've already had five of them, but the devil says I've had six.

1330
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,400
麦香堡和可乐我说不算她说算
But I'm not counting the Big Mac and the Coke,

1331
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,541
你说公平吗？
and she is and I don't think that's fair, do you?

1332
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,112
根本没必要嘛
This is so unnecessary.

1333
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,670
跟我们走一趟
- You're coming downtown. - The devil gypped me for a burger!

1334
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,582
用个汉堡骗我！

1335
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,515
告诉警官
Tell your story to the sergeant.

1336
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,086
手上有合约吗？
So do you have a copy of this contract?

1337
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,520
我说过在她办公室
No, I told you, she keeps it in her office.

1338
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,192
在奥克兰的一家俱乐部
- At this nightclub in Oakland. - Yes, at a nightclub

1339
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:05,127
对，不，我不能洩密

1340
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,095
因为你答应过魔鬼？
and, no, I can't tell you where it is.

1341
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,489
Because you promised the devil you wouldn't?

1342
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:08,562
不，因为是她开车
No, because she drove. That's why.

1343
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:12,465
开一台林宝坚尼「恶魔」
Right. In a Lamborghini Diablo.

1344
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,136
听我说，条伯伯…
- Look, Officer. - Sergeant.

1345
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,466
是警官

1346
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,072
警官，我知道我的人权
Sergeant, I know my rights.

1347
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,005
我有权请律师
I don't have to talk to you without a lawyer.

1348
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,542
你要不起诉，要不放我走
So you either book me or you let me go.

1349
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:26,216
怎麽办？我好怕哦
Oh, gee, are those my choices?

1350
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,425
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?

1351
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,979
我选择起诉
I choose "book you." Throw him in the lockup.

1352
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:33,087
关他，罪名酒醉妨碍公共安全
Arraignment in the morning.

1353
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,764
- Drunk and disorderly. - What?! Hey!

1354
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,952
需要心理治疗
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation. - It's her! It's her, she's the devil!

1355
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:36,317
她…她就是魔鬼
One more word out of you and I'll pop you one, you whacko bastard.

1356
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,730
再囉 我就让你吃不了都著走

1357
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,563
快走
Now move it.

1358
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,934
脚分开
Spread them.

1359
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,142
不需要再为几次而争辩了
There's no point fighting about this.

1360
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,736
你必须接受事实
You have to learn to accept the inevitable.

1361
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,250
这是命中注定
We're all doomed anyway,

1362
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:04,778
你当然可以许愿离开这裡
so you might as well just get with the program,

1363
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,797
wish your way out of here, and move on.

1364
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:12,752
我说过我喜欢你 这是真的，艾略特
I wasn't kidding when I said I liked you.

1365
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,231
我认为你潜力十足
I do, Elliot.

1366
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,099
I think you have massive potential.

1367
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:19,269
如果你将永远待在地狱的话
If you're looking at an eternity in hell,

1368
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:24,935
那我告诉你 你会需要像我这样的朋友
let me tell you,

1369
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:24,483
it wouldn't hurt to have a friend like me.

1370
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,273
你好好想想，准备好了就找我
So you just think about that. Give me a call when you're ready.

1371
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,194
她是魔鬼
Man: She's a devil, that one.

1372
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,631
Elliot: What?

1373
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:57,307
那个女警是魔鬼
I said, she's a devil, that lady cop.

1374
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:02,677
对…我想是吧

1375
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:02,521
Yeah, I guess.

1376
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:05,247
会关多久？
What you in for, brother?

1377
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:08,079
一生一世
Eternity.

1378
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:12,948
那是很长的时间 想必你犯下了大错
Oh, that's a long time.

1379
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,864
You must have did some really bad shit.

1380
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:16,326
是啊
Yeah.

1381
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,793
我出卖我的灵魂
I sold my soul.

1382
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,558
希望你有回报
Hope you got something good for it.

1383
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,129
事实上，我什麽都没得到
As a matter of fact, I got nothing for it.

1384
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:27,565
照我看来，这交易真烂
Well, that's a really bad deal, if you ask me.

1385
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:29,631
Well, I'm not asking you.

1386
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,932
我又没问你的看法

1387
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:38,508
不过没关係，灵魂是无法贩卖
Doesn't really matter, though.

1388
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,392
- You can't sell your soul anyway. - Oh, really?

1389
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:40,851
真的吗？
Why do you say that?

1390
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,910
你为何这麽说？

1391
01:14:43,353 --> 01:14:47,119
毕竟灵魂不是属于你自己的
It doesn't really belong to you in the first place.

1392
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,190
No way, nohow.

1393
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:50,819
So who does it belong to?

1394
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:53,193
那是属于谁的？

1395
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:57,163
上帝的
It belongs to God.

1396
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:01,429
所有的灵魂都是要让实体存在
That universal spirit that animates

1397
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,122
and binds all things in existence.

1398
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,933
魔鬼噱你的
The devil gonna try to confuse you. But that's her gig.

1399
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:07,878
这是她的手法

1400
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:13,783
但到最后你就会真正瞭解自己 自己为何而来
But in the end, you'll see clear to who and what you are

1401
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,216
and what you're here to do.

1402
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:17,149
人非圣藉，熟能无过
Now, you're gonna make some mistakes along the way,

1403
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:22,689
只要你敞开心胸与智慧
everybody does,

1404
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:20,765
but if you just open up your heart and open up your mind,

1405
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,894
you'll get it.

1406
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,896
你会懂的

1407
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:30,265
你是谁？
Who are you?

1408
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,765
一个朋友
Just a friend, brother.

1409
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:36,566
一个真正的好朋友
Just a really good friend.

1410
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,555
Woman: Hey, baby!

1411
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:49,772
艾略特，这裡

1412
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:54,481
我们爱你，艾略特
We love you, Elliot!

1413
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,516
艾略特，亲爱的
Elliot, darling.

1414
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:59,918
真高兴你来了 到我的办公室吧
So nice of you to drop by.

1415
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:01,074
Come into my office.

1416
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,786
别担心，他们会玩的非常愉快
Oh, don't worry about them. They're having a fabulous time.

1417
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:07,630
他们真可怜，不是吗？
Pathetic, aren't they?

1418
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:11,600
只想要玩乐，却没想到后果
Everybody wants to go to the party,

1419
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,919
but nobody wants to pay the piper.

1420
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,137
你是…？
- Are you...? - Don't get too excited.

1421
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,298
别紧张，这是万圣节的服装
It's just a Halloween costume.

1422
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:20,609
不管这些 你想到最后的愿望了吗？
Anyway, Elliot, my darling, have you thought of your last wish?

1423
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:22,975
没有
No.

1424
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,343
不是要催你，但这有时间限制 看看合约吧
Well, I hate to put a big rush on this, but there is a time limit.

1425
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,683
Read your contract.

1426
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,217
我不想要再许愿了
I really don't want another wish.

1427
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:43,154
真好笑，这个光环是否太夸张
That's funny.

1428
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,240
Do you think this halo's too much?

1429
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:48,205
不会，我真的不想要再许愿
No. I really don't want it.

1430
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:51,868
什麽叫做你不想要 你有七个愿望
What do you mean, you don't want it?

1431
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,417
You get seven wishes.

1432
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,144
我什麽也不想要了
There's nothing I want.

1433
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,478
是有想要 但是不是你可以给我的
Well, there are things that I want, but nothing that you can give me.

1434
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,309
这是什麽意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

1435
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:09,181
昨晚在牢裡，我和别人聊天
Well...

1436
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,849
last night, when I was lying in jail,

1437
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,059
I was talking to this guy

1438
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:12,229
而我发觉许愿是没有用的
and I realized that wishing just doesn't work.

1439
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:16,928
这一生我想要变帅 更有钱，能成功，有天分等等
All my life I wished to be better-looking,

1440
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,275
richer, successful, talented, whatever.

1441
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,738
而我以为可以像变魔术般达成
I always thought it'd be great if someone could just wave

1442
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,738
a magic wand and make that happen.

1443
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:25,230
我真正的瞭解到 魔术无法帮助你完成
Well, I realized that it just doesn't work by magic.

1444
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:27,767
我想我快要吐了
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1445
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:31,475
我就开始思考…
And I've been starting to think that

1446
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:35,047
人生中重要的不是完成了什麽
it really isn't that important how far we go in life anyway.

1447
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:38,449
而是你如何去完成它
It's how we get there that really matters.

1448
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,005
Oh.

1449
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:43,192
这真具有启示性
You know, that is so inspiring.

1450
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:45,592
那这样可以吗？
So it's okay?

1451
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:49,095
不行，恐怕不能这样
Well, no, Elliot. I'm afraid it's not okay.

1452
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,563
买卖就是买卖
A deal's a deal.

1453
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,860
再许一个愿，我好取你的灵魂
You get one more wish, and I get your soul.

1454
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,567
继续吧
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

1455
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,501
我不干
- I'm not gonna do it. - Oh, really?

1456
01:18:57,774 --> 01:18:58,775
真的？
Before you get all hinky, I should warn you.

1457
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:04,008
我警告你，别敬酒不吃吃罚酒

1458
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,947
I'm not all peaches and cream, you know.

1459
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,240
我可有恐怖的一面，不好看哦
I do have a darker side and, believe me, it's not pretty.

1460
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,845
可以用软的，也可以来硬的
Now you can go easy, or you can go hard,

1461
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:14,746
总之你的灵魂我要定了
but one way or another, I will get your soul.

1462
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:19,296
不许愿，任你怎麽说都不
I'm not gonna do it.

1463
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:19,129
There's nothing that you can say or do that will make me.

1464
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:20,797
你会改变主意的
Oh, I think you'll change your mind.

1465
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:25,257
我要变脸了，地狱见
I'm just gonna slip into something a little more terrifying.

1466
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,135
See you in hell!

1467
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:35,812
等等！
Wait, wait, wait! Just wait a minute!

1468
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:38,406
等一下！

1469
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,682
等等！
Wait!

1470
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:46,823
听好，小子，你最后一次机会
Now listen to me, you disgusting little maggot!

1471
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:46,865
This is your last chance

1472
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,087
烤小鸟的时候到了
before the big weenie roast!

1473
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:52,795
许最后一个愿或火刑伺候
Make a wish or forever burn in hell!

1474
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,592
好吧，好吧！
Okay! Okay!

1475
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,800
我希望…
I wish...

1476
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,768
我希望爱丽生有个快乐的人生
I wish that Alison has a happy life.

1477
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,499
天啊
Oh, God.

1478
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,729
这是天堂吗？
Is this heaven?

1479
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,631
天堂？天啊，不是
Heaven? God, no, it's the courthouse.

1480
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:35,235
这是法院 我和几位律师约吃午餐
I'm just meeting a couple of lawyers for lunch.

1481
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,638
等等，那些…
Clients of mine. Come on.

1482
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:41,544
Wait, what happened to the whole,

1483
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:45,872
那些烈火，长角的傢伙呢？

1484
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,796
you know, fire

1485
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:48,092
- and the big, horny guy with... - Oh, just a few special effects.

1486
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,884
只是一点特效

1487
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,375
像环球影城的恶魔之旅
Sort of the Universal Studios tour of evil.

1488
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:53,481
平常很有效，你怎麽没反应
It normally works pretty well, but evidently you weren't going for it.

1489
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,620
最后一个愿望让合约失效了
Your last wish was a deal-breaker.

1490
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:58,258
什麽？
- What? - Nobody ever reads the contract.

1491
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,896
从来没人读合约

1492
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:02,831
第147项第9段第3款
Article 147, paragraph 9, section 3:

1493
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:05,902
「无私行为之救赎」
Selfless acts of redemption.

1494
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:09,360
说到若某人做了真正无私之举
Huh?

1495
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:09,113
Basically, it says, "If you commit one truly benevolent act,

1496
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,101
合约即告无效
it voids the contract."

1497
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,909
我能保有我的灵魂？
So I get to keep my soul?

1498
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:15,707
是的，你能保有你的灵魂
Yes, you get to keep your soul.

1499
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:24,081
正，留住灵魂了！
Yes!

1500
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:24,295
Yes! I get to keep my soul!

1501
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:35,091
这一行我做六千年了 你是第一个放弃愿望的人
On November 16th, I'll have been doing this for 6,000 years

1502
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,057
and you're the first person to give away one of their wishes.

1503
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,525
希望这不是一种趋势
I hope it's not the beginning of a trend.

1504
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:38,935
你不会说出去吧？
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? - No, no, I promise.

1505
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:40,800
不会，我答应你

1506
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,689
Nope.

1507
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:47,035
我不懂，为什麽你那麽…好？
I don't get it, though. I mean, why are you being nice?

1508
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:50,811
告诉你一个小秘密
Look, Elliot. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

1509
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:55,281
一切善与恶，他跟我
The whole "good and evil" thing...

1510
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,909
you know, Him and me.

1511
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,954
都是自我的选择
It really comes down to you.

1512
01:21:57,954 --> 01:22:01,981
天堂和地狱都存在于世上
You don't have to look hard for heaven and hell.

1513
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,292
They're right here on Earth.

1514
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:06,963
自由选择，你也作了你的抉择
You make the choice.

1515
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,421
And I guess you just made yours.

1516
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:08,988
所以我可以走了？
So I can go now?

1517
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,967
除非你想再来七个愿望
Unless you want another seven wishes.

1518
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,197
不了，谢谢
- No, thanks. - Didn't think so.

1519
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,337
想必你也不要

1520
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,805
我真的喜欢你
I really liked you, you know.

1521
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:23,207
告诉你一件事
Well, to tell you the truth,

1522
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,311
你是我最好的朋友
you've been the best friend I've ever had.

1523
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:29,714
得了，别弄得噁心巴拉
Oh, dear. Don't go gushy on me now.

1524
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,485
Okay.

1525
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:33,478
走吧，别把我的鱼儿吓跑了
Go on. Go. You'll scare the fish away.

1526
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,341
爱丽生？
Alison?

1527
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:58,913
嗨，唔…
- Hi. - Hi.

1528
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,556
Oh, uh...

1529
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:01,518
艾略特裡察，我们见过几次
Elliot Richards. We've met a couple times.

1530
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:04,282
想起来了，嗨，你好
Yeah, I remember. Hi, how are you?

1531
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:08,650
非常好，太夸张了，还好啦
I'm great.

1532
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,358
I'm exaggerating. I'm good.

1533
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:14,690
我们同事四年了
We've been working together here for the last four years

1534
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,535
我常注意到你，心裡想…
and I've always noticed you

1535
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:22,301
你好像挺有趣的
and thought that you looked like a very interesting person.

1536
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,541
我不觉得我有趣
I don't know how interesting I am.

1537
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,875
事实上，我们互不相识
Well, the truth is I don't know you and you don't know me,

1538
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:32,446
如果我们有机会彼此瞭解
and if we were to get to know each other

1539
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:37,748
说不定我们蛮来电的 能不能请你喝杯咖啡？
that there's a chance that we just might hit it off.

1540
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,970
So I was wondering if you wanted to go get a cup of coffee or...

1541
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:41,455
你人真好
That's really so nice of you.

1542
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:46,052
我已经有男朋友了
I'm seeing someone.

1543
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,587
可想而知
Well, of course you are.

1544
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:51,966
他真是个幸运儿
He's sure one lucky guy.

1545
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:57,267
万一有一天你跟他…
Listen, if it ever doesn't work out with him, then...

1546
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,075
我…

1547
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:01,168
你真好玩
- That's so nice of you. - Really?

1548
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,512
谢谢，回头见
- Yeah. Okay. - Thanks a lot.

1549
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,481
保重
- I'll see you around. - Okay, take care. Bye.

1550
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:11,588
去啊，开个玩笑嘛
- Go. It's a joke. - It's only 10 bucks.

1551
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,591
他正要…
- What's he gonna do? - Right.

1552
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,752
艾略特，真…臭…臭略特
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot, so-smelliot.

1553
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,095
怎麽啦，好友？
What's up, dudester? Yeah.

1554
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:24,055
晚上去钓几管马子怎麽样？
What do you say we go down to the club tonight

1555
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,808
and pick up some chickette?

1556
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,399
说得真好，鲍伯

1557
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:27,770
Nice talking to you, Bob.

1558
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:03,901
新邻居吗？
- Hey. - New neighbors?

1559
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,199
是吧
Guess so.

1560
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,648
哦，嗨
Hi. Oh.

1561
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,741
你一定是隔壁的男孩
Hi. You must be the boy next door.

1562
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,617
可以帮个忙吗？
Do you want to give me a hand?

1563
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:18,552
会说英语吗？
Habla English? Spracht English?

1564
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:22,056
会说英语吗？
Parlez-vous "Americiano"?

1565
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:27,629
嗨，艾略特裡察
- Hi, I'm Elliot Richards. - Hey. Nicole Delarusso.

1566
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,666
妮可迪拉罗素，不要叫我妮基
Don't call me Nicky, though. Everyone always calls me Nicky.

1567
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,293
虽然每个人都那麽叫

1568
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,671
妮可，然后变妮基，然后妮克
It starts as Nicole, then becomes Nicky, then Nick,

1569
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,674
然后妮，最后只剩
then Ni, then just "Nn." People just call me "Nn."

1570
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:39,039
说著好玩的
I'm cracking myself up here.

1571
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:39,903
可以帮我忙吗？
- You want to give me a hand? - Yes, I do.

1572
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:41,234
可以
- Okay. - Oh, wow.

1573
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,944
哇，是新款英格布裡逊音响
You got the new Ingebritzens!

1574
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:48,275
顶尖厂牌！
- Yeah, they're the best! - They're the best!

1575
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:54,691
我可以帮你组起来
I'd be happy to hook these up for you

1576
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,990
整理时就有音乐听了
so you could have some music, if you wanted, while you're unpacking.

1577
01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:00,594
我可以作晚餐，你就不用煮了
I could make us dinner... that way you won't have to cook.

1578
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:02,699
我…我煮饭？
Yeah, right. Me, cook?

1579
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,667
谢啦
Thank you.

1580
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,534
你没有姐妹吧？
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen to have a sister, would you?

1581
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:10,707
没有，兄弟倒不少，可是…
No sisters,

1582
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,197
都是些混帐

1583
01:26:55,451 --> 01:27:01,412
吃相难看-抢被子

1584
01:27:02,959 --> 01:28:13,552
