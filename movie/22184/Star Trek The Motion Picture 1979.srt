你还没有达到高灵亚

他不会在这里找到它的

戴克队长叫我出发前做最后简报
Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here

46
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,500
在离开之前. 在星际舰队?

47
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,090
进取号正在做出发前最后准备
The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock.

48
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,010
那需要二十小时 十二小时
Which will require 20 more hours at minimum. Twelve.

49
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,840
我去见诺古拉司令
I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura

50
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,180
不会很久的

51
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,060
一小时后在进取号上向我报到
Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.

52
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,310
向你报到?
Report to you, sir?

53
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,230
会议后我打算登上那艘太空船
It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting.

54
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,070
一小时后向我报到
Report to me in one hour.

55
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,470
司令 史考特先生
Admiral! Mr. Scott.

56
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,680
十二小时后出发 不是认真的吧
Those departure orders, 12 hours, Starfleet cannot be serious.

57
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,140
为何那些输送器仍未操作?
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters operating, Mr. Scott?

58
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,020
有个小问题 暂时性的
A wee problem, sir. Just temporary.

59
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,680
我们刚完成18个月
Admiral, we have just finished 18 months

60
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,400
的进取号改装
redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.

61
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,790
怎能12小时后出发
How in the name of hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours?

62
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,990
送我去吧
Take me over, please.

63
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,200
她需要试航
She needs more work, sir. A shakedown.

64
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,170
有一个杀伤力惊人的外星物体...
Mr. Scott, an alien object of unbelievable destructive power

65
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,710
不足三天就会来到地球

66
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,460
在拦截范围内的飞船只有进取号
The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise.

67
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,630
无论如何 要在12小时后发射
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.

68
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,990
船员没有足够时间熟习新仪器
The crew haven't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment.

69
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,120
而且引擎也未测试曲速动力飞行
And the engines, they're not even tested at warp power.

70
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,130
还有一个不熟练的队长
And an untried captain.

71
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,630
我当了星际舰队行动总管两年半
Two and a half years as chief of Starfleet operations

72
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,510
可能状态不佳 但并非不熟练
may have made me a little stale, but I wouldn't exactly consider myself untried.

73
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,270
他们把她还给我 把她交还?
They gave her back to me, Scotty. "Gave" her back, sir?

74
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,350
我怀疑诺古拉可会那么易商量
Well, I doubt it was that easy with Nogura.

75
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,850
你说得对
You're right.

76
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,740
任何有这个能耐的人...
Well, any man who could manage such a feat,

77
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,780
我也不敢怠慢
I would not dare to disappoint.

78
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,950
长官 她会作好准备
She'll launch on time, sir. And she'll be ready.

79
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,410

84
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,760
长官 失陪了
Sir, you'll excuse me.

85
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,680
注意 启动船员

发生了什么?
What's the problem?

91
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,540
我以为你一小时前接驳了线路
I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago!

92
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,040
是的 我们不得不再次中断 所以我们可以配合无线通讯
We did. We had to disconnect it again so we could tie in radio messaging.

93
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,540
好 执行
All right. Take out...

94
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,840

137
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,870
我比你更熟悉它
You don't know her a tenth as well as I do!

138
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,520
所以你还能留在船上
That's why you're staying aboard.

139
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
对不起 威尔
I'm sorry, Will.

140
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,050
司令 我认为你完全没有歉意
No, Admiral. I don't think you're sorry. Not one damn bit.

141
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,310
我记得你推荐我作指挥时
I remember when you recommended me for this command.

142
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,250
你说多希望
You told me how envious you were

143
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,610
找到办法再指挥飞船
and how much you hoped you'd find a way to get a starship command again.

144
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,860
长官 看来你找到办法了
Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.

145
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,740
指挥官 马上到舰桥报到
Report to the bridge, Commander, immediately.

146
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,080
是 长官
Aye, sir.

147
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,260
输送室 请通话
Transporter room, come in! Urgent!

148
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,180
输送器上出现了红线
Red line on the transporter, Mr. Scott.

149
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,600
别接合 太迟了 它们在发射
Transporter! Do not engage. It's too late. They're beaming now.

150
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,570
听到吗? 撤销我们 把他们拉回
Do you read me, Starfleet? Override it. Pull them back.

151
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,780
不能撤回他们了 进取号
Unable to retrieve their pattern, Enterprise.

152
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,950
故障! 故障! 故障!
Malfunction! Malfunction! Malfunction!

153
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,910
故障! 故障! 给我
Malfunction! Malfunction! Give it to me!

154
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,210
故障!
Malfunction!

155
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,340
星际舰队 增强物体接收讯号
Starfleet, boost your matter gain. We need more signal.

156
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,550
要多一点讯号
More signal!

157
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,390
-我们失去形状 -不 他们在形成
-We're losing their pattern. -Oh, no. They're forming.

158
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,200
天啊!
Oh, my God.

159
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,420
星际舰队 接收到他们吗?
Starfleet, do you have them?

160
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,920
进取号 我们接收到的东西死了
Enterprise, what we got back didn't live long.

161
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,170
幸运
Fortunately.

162
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,010
星际舰队 是柯克
Starfleet, Kirk.

163
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,020
请代我向他们的家人致哀
Please express my condolences to their families.

164
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,610
可以通过火神星大使馆接触桑尼
Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy.

165
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,070
兰 你没什么可以做的
There was nothing you could have done, Rand.

166
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,030
那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

167
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,150
涡轮发动机八号? 在那边
Yeoman, turboshaft eight? Back that way, sir.

168
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:46,080
我想找个火神星人接替桑尼
We have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.

169
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,700
没人对这设计
None available, Captain. In fact,

170
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,160
是完全熟悉的
there's no one who's fully rated on this design.

171
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,750
你熟悉 你要兼当科学员
You are, Mr. Decker. I'm afraid you're gonna have to double as science officer.

172
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,870
我们所知的只有这些
That's all we know about it.

173
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,460
除了它现在距离地球53.4小时
Except that it is now 53.4 hours away from Earth.

174
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,430
进取号是唯一在它途中的飞船
Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way.

175
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:50,040
我们的任务是要拦截
We assume that there is a vessel of some type

176
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,560
调查...
at the heart of the cloud. Our orders are to intercept,

177
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,110
和采取有必要及可行的行动
investigate and take whatever action is necessary and possible.

178
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,260
希望那个物体上有生命
We can only hope that there is a life form aboard that vessel

179
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,620
了解我们的做法
that reasons the way we do.

180
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,710
舰桥呼叫队长 E9有紧急讯号
Bridge to Captain. Priority signal from Epsilon IX.

181
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,880
传上视像器 知道
Put it on viewer. On viewer, sir.

182
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,670
进取号 那股星云是某种强力场
Enterprise. The cloud is definitely a power field of some kind.

183
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,680
直径...我的天...有超过两埃
Measures... My God! Over 82 AUs in diameter.

184
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,600
里面一定有种神奇的东西产生它
Must be something incredible inside there generating it.

185
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,980
我们正在各波段发放友好讯息
We're transmitting linguacode friendship messages on all frequencies.

186
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,110
没有回应
No response.

187
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,070
中心没有读数
I have a null reading at the centre of the cloud.

188
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,950
里面没有东西 但扫描全被射回
Definitely something inside there, but all scans are being reflected back.

189
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,370
有动力上升 接收到奇怪的图像
Some kind of power surge. Receiving an odd pattern now!

190
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,620
他们可能把我们的扫描视为敌意
Enterprise, they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act.

191
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,040
他们对扫描反应 导向器全速
They seem to be reacting to our scans, sir. Deflectors, emergency full!

192
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,460
我们被袭击 外界情况视像
We are under attack! External view.

193
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,820
关闭视像器
Viewer off. Viewer off!

194
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,080
发射倒数在四十分钟后开始
Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes.

195
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,690

长官 伊莉亚中尉报到 欢迎
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir. Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

204
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,970
你好 伊莉亚 戴克
Hello, Ilia. Decker.

205
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,140
我几年前驻守在中尉的星球
I was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago.

206
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,190
戴克指挥官?
Commander Decker?

207
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,020
我们的执行及科学员
Yes, our exec and science officer.

208
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,400
柯克队长对我有绝对信心

209
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,780
对你也是 中尉
And, in you, too, Lieutenant.

210
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,530
我已发过禁欲誓言
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.

211
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,910
可工作了吧? 当然可以
May I assume my duties? By all means.

212
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,080
队长 最后六个船员准备输送
Captain? Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up,

213
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,790
但其中一个拒绝踏入输送器
but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.

214
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,630
我去确保他进行输送 输送室
Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up. Transporter room.

215
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,280
你发誓永远不回星际舰队的
Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to the Starfleet...

216
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,080
队长 等一等 我会解释
Just a moment, Captain, sir. I'll explain what happened.

217
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,290
你受敬重的诺古拉上将
Your revered Admiral Nogura

218
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,960
实施鲜为人知的征用后备军条例
invoked a little known, seldom used reserve activation clause.

219
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,250
简单而言 他们征召我入伍
In simpler language, Captain, they drafted me.

220
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,800
他们没有
They didn't.

221
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,140
这是你的主意 是不是?
This was your idea. This was your idea, wasn't it?

222
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,680
外面有一样东西
Bones, there's a thing out there.

223
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,930
任何我们不懂的物体都叫东西
Why is any object we don't understand always called a "thing"?

224
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,770
朝着这方向来的 我需要你
Headed this way. I need you.

225
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,990
该死 邦斯 我很需要你
Damn it, Bones. I need you. Badly!

226
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,210
请批准登船 批准 长官

Well, Jim. I hear Chapel's an MD now.

228
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,350
我需要一个高级护士
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse.

229
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,600
不是个跟我争辩每个诊断的医生
Not a doctor who'll argue every little diagnosis with me.

230
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,900
他们可能把整个医疗室也改装了
And they probably redesigned the whole sickbay, too.

231
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,650
工程师们喜欢改动东西
I know engineers. They love to change things.

232
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,970
船坞控制室说准备好了

星际日期7412.6 发射后1.8小时
Captain's Log, Stardate 7412.6, 1.8 hours from launch.

246
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,370
为了尽快拦截入侵者
In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time,

247
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,830
我们在太阳系中冒险作曲速飞行
we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system.

248
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,790
假设我们完全有曲速飞行性能
Captain, assuming we have full warp capability,

249
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,760
在太阳系外加速至曲速度第七级
accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system

250
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,220
会让我们在20.1小时后拦截入侵者
will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours.

251
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,890
科学员计算确认
Science officer's computation confirmed, sir.

252
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,650
邦斯 你满意那些新设备吗?
Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval?

253
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,110
不满意 像在电脑中心工作似的
They do not. It's like working in a damned computer centre.

254
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,620
程式准备了 调校作曲速飞行
Programming ready? Program set for standard warp entry, Captain,

255
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,660
但我仍提议作进一步模拟研究
but I still recommend further simulation study.

256
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,460
那物体每过一分钟就更接近地球
Mr. Decker, every minute brings that object closer to Earth.

257
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,250
工程人员 准备作曲速推进
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.

258
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,550
我们还要进一步模拟流动感应器

吉姆 你在咄咄逼人
Jim? You're pushing.

261
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,770
你的下属明白他们的工作
Your people know their jobs.

262
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,820
就这样 我已尽了力 是的
That's it, sir. I can't do any better. Aye, lad.

263
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,350
模拟器勉强可行
It's borderline on the simulator, Captain.

264
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,780
我不能保证
I cannot guarantee that she'll hold up.

265

Unidentified small object

279
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,440

289
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,120

304
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,040

Wrong, Mr. Chekov, there are casualties. My wits!

305
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,750
正如"受惊吓" 队长
As in "frightened out of," Captain, sir.

306
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,380
我们在曲速度0.8 报告情况
We're at warp 0.8. Engineer, report your status there.

307
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,970
等一等 我们正在了解情况
In just a second, Exec. We're picking up the pieces down here!

308
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,300
史考特先生 我们要曲速推进
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible.

309
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,640
有个引擎失调
Captain, it was the engine imbalance

310
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,270
造成那个蠕虫洞
that created the wormhole in the first place.

311
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,440
我们要矫正它
It will happen again if we don't correct it.

312
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,820
那物体离地球不足两天

313
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,900
要拦截
We need to intercept while it still is out there.

314
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,740
领航员 设定新航导配合拦截点
Navigator, lay in a new heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder.

00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,580
介意我跟着来吗 队长?
Mind if I tag along, Captain?

318

五楼
Level five.

319
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,590
解释为何要收回我的突变仪命令
All right, explanation. Why was my phaser order countermanded?

320
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,640
改装了的进取号通过它的主引擎
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power

321
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,020
可以增强突变动力
by channeling it through the main engines.

322
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,560
当它们出现反物质不平衡时
When they went into antimatter imbalance,

323
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,060
那些突变仪就自动切断了
the phasers were automatically cut off.

324
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,780
你做得对
Then you acted properly, of course.

325
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,820
过奖 长官
Thank you, sir.

326
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,990
抱歉 如果我令你感到尴尬
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

327
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,450
你拯救了飞船 我明白 长官
You saved the ship. I'm aware of that, sir.

328
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,460
别再和我对抗 戴克
Stop competing with me, Decker!

329
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,630
请求批准直言 批准
Permission to speak freely, sir? Granted!

330
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,930
你两年半来没有作过星际飞行
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years.

331
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,140
加上你不熟悉这艘飞船的新设计
That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir,

332
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,720
我认为会严重危害这次任务
seriously jeopardizes this mission.

333
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:43,940
我相信你会协助我解决这些困难
I trust you will nursemaid me through these difficulties, mister?

334
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,400
是 长官 我会的
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

335
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,120
那么我不阻延你执行任务了
Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander.

336
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,410
是 医生? 长官
Yes, Doctor? Aye, sir.

337
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
吉姆 他可能是对的
He may be right, Jim.

338
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,850
很难应付?
Was it difficult?

339
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,850
我早料到 像重遇你般难应付
No more than I expected. About as difficult as seeing you again.

340
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,520
抱歉
I'm sorry.

341
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,520
因你离开德尔塔四号? 还是你不辞而别?
That you left Delta IV? Or that you didn't even say goodbye?

342
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,910
如果当时我再遇上你
If I had seen you again,

343
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,120
你说得出再见吗?
would you have been able to say it?

344
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,950
不能
No.

345
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,590
说吧 医生
Make your point, Doctor.

346
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,050
我认为你在跟自己过不去
The point, Captain, is that it's you who's competing.

347
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,810
你强行向星际舰队得到这次指挥
You rammed getting this command down Starfleet's throat.

348
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,560
你利用这次紧急事件得回进取号
You've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back.

349
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,230
而我打算保留她 是不是?
And I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying?

350
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,550
是 这是一种执念
Yes. It's an obsession.

351
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,100
可以蒙蔽你处理
An obsession that can blind you to

352
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,280
更紧急的职责
far more immediate and critical responsibilities.

353
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,830
你对戴克的反应就是个例子
Your reaction to Decker is an example, Jim.

354
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,400
舰桥呼叫队长 开启视像器
Bridge to Captain. Viewer on.

355
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,630
一艘联盟登记的远程穿梭机发讯
Signal from a Federationregistered longrange shuttle, sir.

356
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,170
希望飞到我们旁边并锁定
She wishes to come alongside and lock on.

357
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,260
为什么?
For what purpose?

358
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,050
保安扫描显示它有一级特权
My security scan shows it has a Grade 1 priority, Captain.

359

360
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,430
我怀疑它是某种信使
I suspect it is a courier of some kind.

361
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,810
好的 柴可夫先生 去看着
Very well, Mr. Chekov. See to it.

362
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,440
关掉视像器
Viewer off.

363
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,600
你的意见已被采纳 还有事吗?
Your opinion has been noted. Anything further?

364
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,700
那要看你了
That depends on you.

365
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,800
安全扫描 有登船者 非活跃星际舰队人员
Security scan. One boarder. Identity, Starfleet. Inactive.

366
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,700
长官 要求批准登船
Permission to come aboard, sir.

367
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,540
批准 长官
Granted, sir! Granted.

368
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:42,810
为什么...是... 史波克!
Why, why, it's Mr Spock! Spock.

369
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,440
指挥官 我可以吗?
Commander, if I may?

370
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:08,330
我监察过你跟星际舰队的通讯
I've been monitoring your communications with Starfleet Command, Captain.

371
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,170
我知道你们的引擎设计有困难
I'm aware of your engine design difficulties.

372
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,800
我愿意当科学员

恕我冒犯 指挥官
With all due respect, Commander.

374
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,010
我们的执行员不反对吧?
If our exec has no objections?

375
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,640
不反对 我知道史波克先生的资格
Of course not. I'm well aware of Mr Spock's qualifications.

Which means, we will now be able to intercept intruder

389
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
仍可以拦截到入侵者

你跟从前一样友善合群

你也没有改变
Nor have you, Doctor,

403
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,140
你偏爱离题万丈的言词
as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates.

404
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,810
两位
Gentlemen.

405
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:17,690
最后报告说 你留在火神星
At last report, you were on Vulcan, apparently to stay.

406
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,440
对 你要接受高灵亚的训练
Yes, you were undergoing the Kolinahr discipline.

407
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,700
坐下
Sit down.

408
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,530
如果你指的是高灵亚 你是对的
If you are referring to the Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.

409
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,490
叫什么也好吧
Well, however it's pronounced, Mr Spock,

410
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,370
它是驱走所有情感的火神星仪式
it's the Vulcan ritual that's supposed to purge all remaining emotions.

411
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,550
你违抗了高灵亚的纪律来找我们
The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us.

412
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,970
你坐下来好吗?
Will you please sit down?

413
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,110
我在火神星感到一股强大意识
On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness

414
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,780
是我从来没感觉过的
from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered.

415
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,030
是绝对完好的思想模式
Thought patterns of exactingly, perfect order.

416
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,030
我相信是入侵者发射的
I believe they emanate from the intruder.

417
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,450
我相信它掌握着我的答案
I believe it may hold my answers.

418
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,420
我们朝你而来是不是很幸福?
Well, isn't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way?

419
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,540
邦斯!
Bones!

420
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,340
我们需要他
We need him.

421
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,800
我需要他
I need him.

422
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,100
那么我的出现对我们双方都有利
Then my presence is to our mutual advantage?

423
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,190
你感应到任何思想模式...
Any thought patterns you might sense,

424
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,910
不管影响你与否
whether they appear to affect you personally or not,

425
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,610
马上向我报告
I expect immediately reported.

426
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,200
好的 队长
Of course, Captain.

427
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,410
还有别的事吗?
Is there anything else?

428
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,830
没有
No.

429

吉姆?
Jim?

430
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:13,470
如果这种超级智慧对他这么重要
If this super intelligence is as important to him as he says it is,

431
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,560
我们怎么知道?
how do we know...

432
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,560
他不会置他的利益于飞船之上?
That he wouldn't put his own interests ahead of the ships?

433
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,250
我相信不会是那样的
I could never believe that.

434

舰桥呼叫休息室 柯克队长 重估星云出现时间 3.7分钟

建议采取防御措施 庇护屏障
Recommend defensive posture, Captain. Screens and shields.

449
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,650

450
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,320
史波克先生 星云结构?

我们见过他们的威力
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do.

453
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,240
要作防备
Shouldn't we take every possible precaution?

454
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,080
我怀疑那星云的中心有一个物件
I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.

455
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:07,560
我不会挑起侵袭
Mr Decker, I will not provoke an attack.

456
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,210
如果不清楚...
If that order isn't clear enough for you...

457
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,720
作为执行员 我有责任提出办法
Captain, as your exec, it's my duty to point out alternatives.

458
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:19,640
是的 我同意

464
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,720
几千艘飞船也产生不到那么多
Thousands of starships couldn't generate that much...

465
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:02,810

485
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,170
上次信号模式太原始 无法接收

486
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,260
我会设定我们的电脑

正是 我们不知道它会做什么
We don't know what it'll do.

509
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,750
现在进入那星云是不必要的冒险
Moving into that cloud at this time is an unwarranted gamble.

510
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,130
你怎么界定"不必要"?
How do you define "unwarranted"?

511
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,630
你问我的意见的 长官

520
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:53,750
所有从星云传送的信息都被射回

苏鲁先生 把放大量降至四级

524
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,580
苏鲁先生 驶进并行航道
Mr Sulu,

525
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:31,810
在外星人上五百米
bring us into a parallel course over the alien at 500 meters.

526
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,090
五百米?

史波克先生 那可会是他们的船员之一?
Mr Spock, can that be one of their crew?

01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:33,760
是他们飞船的探测器 等离子体能量组合

540
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,210
它看来只对这艘飞船感兴趣

关掉电脑
Computer off!

542
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,030
它控制了电脑

543
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:24,700
它在检视我们的记录 地球防卫

544
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:07,080
伊莉亚

545
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,560
这就是我说的"不必要"!

556
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:25,400
若我们15秒内不脱离
Going to full emergency!

557
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,620
就会燃烧
But, Captain, if we don't break free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up!

558
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,750
办不到 我们只有少量的动力
We cannot break free, Captain. We have only a fraction of the power necessary.

559
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:36,340
工程组 延续命令切断主推进器

Aye. Captain, a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam

570
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,960
用高度突变袭击可助我们脱身

脱身去哪里?
Break free to where, Commander?

572
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,630
任何反抗都会无效
Any show of resistance would be futile, Captain.

573
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,600
我们不知道 为何你反对尝试?
We don't know that, Mr Spock. Why are you opposed to trying?

574
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:06,780
为何要引我们进去? 他们早就可以在外面摧毁我们
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us. They could have done that outside.

575
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,530
他们仍然可以
They still can.

576
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,320

史波克先生 启动感应扫描
Let's take a look. Full sensor scan, Mr Spock.

587
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,990
他们该料到我们会扫描他们
They can't expect us not to look them over now.

588
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,490
我们往他们的喉咙看下去
Now that we're looking down their throat.

589
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,950
我们在他们预料的位置中了
Right. Now that we've got them just where they want us.

590
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,180
它在关闭
It's closing up.

591
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,100
保持位置
Hold position.

592
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,980
协调推进器
Thrusters at stationkeeping, sir.

593
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,940
队长
Captain?

594
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,530
我们所有扫描都被射回
All our scans are being reflected back. Sensors are useless.

595
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,280
感应器都是没用的 该死!
Damn!

596
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:27,880
你认为这是什么?
What do you make of all this?

597
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,590
那关上的洞口是通往另一个室的
I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber.

598
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,430
肯定是这艘飞船部分的内部结构
Undoubtedly, part of the vessel's inner mechanism.

599
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:38,510
我怀疑可能需要...

01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,990
保持位置 入侵者位置
Hold position. Intruder location, a sonic shower.

604
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:59,950
入侵者地点温度 温度急剧下降了
Temperature at intruder location, temperature drop rapid now.

605
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,200
60度
60 degrees.

606
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:06,250
50度 温度曲线平坦
50 degrees. Temperature curve flattening.

607
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:10,000
45度 40度

608
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,760
温度平衡 39度
Temperature leveling, 39 degrees.

609
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,390
你就是柯克组件 你要协助我

610
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,970
持续37.65度
Holding at 37.65 degrees.

611
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:25,100
我受"威者"程式来观察和记录
I've been programmed by V'Ger to observe and record

612
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:30,690
侵扰进取号的碳化组件平常功能
normal functions of the carbonbased units infesting U.S.S. Enterprise.

613
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:34,150
持续37.65度
Holding at 37.65 degrees.

614
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,290
吉姆 什么事? 三维录像器
Jim, what's going on? Tricorder.

615
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,670
谁是...威者
Who is V'Ger?

616
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,550
"威者"? 我的程式就是威者输入的
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

617
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,550
威者是那艘飞船的船长名字?
Is V'Ger the name of the captain of the alien vessel?

618
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:08,150
吉姆 这是个机械人 一个探测器
Jim, this is a mechanism. A probe, Captain.

619
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:11,400
肯定是个感应收发组合

620
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,030
记录我们所说和所做的一切

621
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:19,200
伊莉亚在哪? 那组件失效了
Where is Lieutenant Ilia? That unit no longer functions.

622
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,900
我以它的形体
I've been given its form to more readily

623
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:26,290
跟侵扰进取号的...

625
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:38,380
为何威者要去太阳系的第三行星
Why does V'Ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?

626
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,390
为了寻找创造者
To find the Creator.

627
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:45,470
什么? 创造者?
Find the Creator? Whose...

628
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,690
谁的...? 威者要创造者做什么?

和他结合 和他结合? 怎样?
To join with him. To join with the Creator? How?

630
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,450
威者和创造者会合而为一
V'Ger and the Creator will become one.

631
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:01,240

632
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,120
创造者是创造威者的

威者是谁? 威者搜寻创造者
Who is V'Ger? V'Ger is that which seeks the Creator.

634
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,920
我准备开始进行我的观察

635
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:19,260
检验这个探测器
Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe might provide some insight

636
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:23,090
可能探究到它由谁制造 和怎样应付他们 好的
into those who manufactured it and how to deal with them.

637
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,310
带她到医疗室
Fine. Let's get her to sickbay.

638
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:32,650
我的程式只是作观察和记录...
I am programmed to observe and record

639
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:35,310
碳化组件的平常功能
only the normal functioning of the carbonbased units.

640
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,440
这个检验是平常功能
The examination is a normal function.

641
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,320
你可以进行检验
You may proceed.

642
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,500
超小型液压
Microminiature hydraulics,

643
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,300
感应器
sensors

644
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,680
还有微型多重处理晶片
and moleculesized multiprocessor chips.

645
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:14,600
看这个 微型渗透泵 这里
And take a look at this. An osmotic micropump right here.

646
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:17,980
最微小的身体机能也复制了出来
And even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated.

647
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,610
所有外分泌系统也是一样
Every exocrine system is the same, too.

648
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:29,200
甚至有眼水
Even eye moisture. Decker.

649
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,710
奇妙 竟然不是叫"戴克组件"
Fascinating. Not "Decker unit"?

650
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,750
各位
Gentlemen.

651
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,130
威尔
Will.

652
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,230
她发生了什么事? 队长
What happened to her?

653
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:57,810
这探测器或是追查外星人的关键
Captain, this probe may be our key to the aliens.

654
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,730
探测器? 伊莉亚? 对
Probe? "Ilia"?

655
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:03,190
它是一个被编了程式的机器
Exactly. It is a programmed mechanism, Commander.

656
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,990
它精确复制我们的领航员的身体
Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail.

657
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,200
假若在它的程式当中
Suppose that beneath its programming,

658
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,330
伊莉亚的记忆也同样被精确复制
the real Ilia memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.

659
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:15,960
他们有一个模式可跟随 对
They had a pattern to follow. Indeed.

660
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,250
他们可能跟得太精确了
They may have followed it too precisely.

661
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:26,130
伊莉亚的记忆 忠心服从 友情 可能都在里面
Ilia memory, her feelings of loyalty, obedience, friendship might all be there!

662
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:30,220
你跟伊莉亚曾经有一段情
You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

663
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,890
就是那模仿的探测器杀死伊莉亚
That probe, in another form, is what killed Ilia!

664
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,600
指挥官!
Commander!

665
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:38,940
我们被困在一艘外星人飞船内
Will, we're locked in an alien vessel, six hours from Earth orbit.

666
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,440
那探测器是与俘虏者唯一的接触
Our only contact with our captor is that probe.

667
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,690
如果我们可以控制它 利用它...
If we could control it, persuade it, use it...

668
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:51,620
我记录够了 你们要再协助我
I have recorded enough here. You will now assist me further.

669
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:59,000
戴克组件可以更有效地协助你的
The decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency.

670
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,840
戴克先生 执行你的任务吧
Carry on with your assignment, Mr Decker.

671
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,010
是 长官
Aye, sir.

672
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,140
我担心那是我们唯一的资料来源
I am concerned with that being our only source of information, Captain.

673
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:25,650

Captain's Log, Stardate 7414.1.

674
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,160
我们最乐观估计距离地球四小时
Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth.

675
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,450
目前仍未有重大进展
No significant progress thus far,

676
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:36,330
在探测器体内还原伊莉亚的记忆
reviving Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe.

677
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:40,000
我们仍只有这个方法联络俘虏者
This remains our only means of contact with our captor.

678
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,670
这些飞船都是叫做进取号
All those vessels were called Enterprise.

679
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:57,850
那些碳化组件在这个范围消遣的
The carbon units use this area for recreation.

680
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,520
这是其中一种游戏
This is one of the games.

681
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:09,990
你们的船员喜欢什么消遣?
What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

682
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:14,450
"消遣"和"喜欢"这些字眼
The words "recreation" and "enjoy"

683
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,160
在我的程式中没有意义
have no meaning to my programming.

684
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,800
伊莉亚喜欢玩这个游戏
Ilia enjoyed this game.

685
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,430
她经常赢的
She nearly always won.

686
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:41,390
很好 他在利用视听联系
Good. He's using audiovisual association.

687
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,600
这个装置没有用途
This device serves no purpose.

688
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,700
为何进取号要有碳化组件在船上
Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units?

689
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:38,950
没有他们 进取号不能运行
Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.

690
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,210
需要更多关于这个功能的资料
More data concerning this functioning is necessary,

691
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:48,000
碳化组件才能用作储存资料
before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.

692
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,380
什么意思?
What does that mean?

693
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:57,300
我的检验完成之后...
When my examination is complete all carbon units

694
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:00,430
所有碳化组件都会缩成资料模式
will be reduced to data patterns.

695
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:05,520
你体内有某个碳化组件的记忆模式
Within you are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit.

696
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,230
若我能帮你还原那些模式
If I can help you to revive those patterns,

697
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,070
你就可以更了解我们的功能
you could understand our functions better.

698
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:15,150
这很合逻辑 你可以进行
That is logical. You may proceed.

699
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:05,870
我记得伊莉亚提过她戴这个
I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that.

700
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:13,800
在德尔塔星 记得吗?
On Delta. Remember?

701
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:16,550
伊莉亚?
Ilia?

702
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:24,310
卓普医生
Doctor Chapel.

703
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:38,070
威尔? 伊莉亚
Will? Ilia.

704
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:43,580
伊莉亚 指挥官
Commander. Commander.

705
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,910
这是一副机器
This is a mechanism.

706
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:59,510
伊莉亚 帮我们直接联络威者吧
Ilia, help us make direct contact with V'Ger.

707
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:04,450
我不可以 威者找的创造者
I cannot. This Creator V'Ger is looking for,

708
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:11,020
是什么? 威者不知道
what is it? V'Ger does not know.

709
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,260
电脑 开始记录
Computer, commence recording.

710
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:45,620
柯克队长 这些信息会详细记下
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail

711
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:48,590
我尝试接触外星人的情况
my attempt to contact the aliens.

712
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:59,740
警告 紧急逃离推进器已装备
Warning! Your emergency evacuation thruster pack has been armed.

713
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:04,660
点火后推进时间10秒
Once ignited, the burn duration is 10 seconds and may not be aborted.

714
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:11,330
按点火钮后开始倒计时
Push the igniterenable release to begin a 10second countdown to thruster ignition.

715
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:16,000
打开把手可除去装置
To abort countdown, flip the control arm up.

716
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,000
我会计算加速程度
I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate

717
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,760
去配合那个威者洞口的开启
to coincide with the opening of the V'Ger orifice.

718
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,800
这样该有助看清楚内部
This should facilitate a better view of the interior of the alien spacecraft.

719
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:35,150
长官 星际舰队的讯号越来越强
Captain? Starfleet signals are growing in strength, sir.

720
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:38,980
他们仍监察到那个入侵者
They still have the intruder on their monitors. It's decelerating.

721
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:43,650
它正在减速 确定 月球信标显示入侵者入地球轨道
Confirmed, sir. Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit.

722
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:49,540
四号气窝被解锁 一件推进衣失踪
Sir, airlock four has been opened. A thruster suit is reported missing.

723
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:55,000
一件推进衣?
A thruster suit?

724
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:58,170
是史波克 该死的
That's Spock. Damn him.

725
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:03,240
把他带回来 不 等一等
Bring him back here. No, wait!

726
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:12,140
找出他的位置 是 长官
Get a fix on his position. Aye, sir!

727
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,760
我已穿过外星人内部的另一个室
I have successfully penetrated the next chamber of the alien's interior,

728
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,810
我看见某种立体影像
and I'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image,

729
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:40,400
我相信是代表威者的原居行星
which I believe to be a representation of V'Ger's home planet.

730
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,030
我正通过一条连接的隧道
I'm passing through a connecting tunnel.

731
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,830
看来是一种等离子体能量管道
Apparently, a kind of plasma energy conduit,

732
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:58,160
可能是个巨型影响系统的场线圈
possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system.

733
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:14,100
奇怪 我看见行星 月亮 星宿
Curious. I'm seeing images of planets, moons, stars,

734
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,060
整个银河系被储存和记录起来
whole galaxies, all stored here, recorded.

735
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,940
这可能代表了威者的整个旅程
It could be a representation of V'Ger's entire journey.

736
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:29,780
但我们要应付的是谁或是什么?
But who or what are we dealing with?

737
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,570
E9太空站被详细地储存在这里
The Epsilon IX station, stored here with every detail.

738
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:45,540
队长 我相信这一切就是威者
Captain, I am now quite convinced that all of this is V'Ger.

739
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,130
我们在一副活的机器里
That we are inside a living machine.

740
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,720
伊莉亚
Ilia!

741
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:06,110
那个感应器一定有特别用意
The sensor must contain some special meaning.

742
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,900
我要尝试和它融合意识
I must try to mindmeld with it.

743
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:10,590
史波克 史波克 史波克
Spock! Spock! Spock!

744
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:30,480
现在扫描脊骨神经纤维连接范围
Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection.

745
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,570
显示有一些神经性创伤
Indications of some neurological trauma.

746
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:41,870
撞击那意识融合的动力一定很大
The power pouring through that mindmeld must have been staggering.

747
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:51,880
史波克 吉姆
Spock. Jim,

748
01:38:55,130 --> 01:39:00,350
我知道 你对威者的看法对吗
I should have known. Were you right? About V'Ger?

749
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:03,680
一个有知觉的活体
A life form of its own.

750
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:09,400
有意识活体的 一副活机器?
A conscious, living entity. A living machine?

751
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,940
它视进取号为一副活机器
It considers the Enterprise a living machine.

752
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:13,780
那就是为什么把我们的 飞船视为活体
That's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.

753
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,700
我看见威者的行星
I saw V'Ger's planet,

754
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:20,450
一个住了很多活机器的行星
a planet populated by living machines.

755
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:23,040
不可思议的科技
Unbelievable technology.

756
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:28,000
威者拥有跨越这个宇宙的知识
V'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe.

757
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:33,710
但是 以它所有的纯逻辑来说...
And yet, with all its pure logic,

758
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:38,970
威者是荒芜 冰冷的
V'Ger is barren, cold.

759
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:45,090
没那么神秘 没有美感
No mystery. No beauty.

760
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,730
我早该知道
I should've known.

761
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:56,230
知道? 知道什么?
Known? Known what? Spock.

762
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,240
长官 老骨头
Captain. Bones!

763
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:09,400
你早该知道什么?
Spock! What should you have known? What should you have known?

764
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:22,340
吉姆 这种简单的感觉...
Jim, this simple feeling

765
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,350
威者是无法领会的
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

766
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:37,780
没有意义 没有希望
No meaning. No hope.

767
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:44,930
没有答案
And Jim, no answers.

768
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:48,290
它在发问 什么问题?
It's asking questions. What questions?

769
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:52,460
"我是否...就是这样? "
"Is this all that I am?"

770
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,880
"还有别的吗? "
"Is there nothing more?"

771
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,840
舰桥呼叫队长
Bridge to Captain.

772
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,560
我是柯克
Kirk here.

773
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,640
星际舰队发出微弱讯号
A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.

774
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:16,190
入侵者星云在监视器上27分钟了
Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors for the past 27 minutes.

775
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,230
星云在靠近时迅速消散
Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches.

776
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,240
星际舰队说速度减至负曲速度
Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to subwarp speed.

777
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:28,880
我们距离地球轨道三分钟 我马上来
We are three minutes from Earth orbit. I'll be right there.

778
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,920
我要史波克到舰桥
I need Spock on the bridge.

779
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,130
5毫升德拉菲素
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

780
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:42,510
机器...发射机器到地球上
A machine planet sending a machine to Earth,

781
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:51,680
寻找创制者 实在难以置信
looking for its Creator. It's absolutely incredible.

782
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:58,940
司令现在位置
Mr. Chekov, Commander Decker's present location?

783
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:01,070
他们专注在工程学 长官
He... They are in engineering, sir.

784
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,660
星际舰队发放这个威者位置图
Captain, Starfleet is sending this tactical on V'Ger's position.

785
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:19,670
航空在传送一个讯号
V'Ger is transmitting a signal.

786
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:25,300
吉姆! 从威者发来的
Jim. From V'Ger.

787
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:32,560
威者向创造者发出讯号
V'Ger signals the Creator.

788
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:54,410
一种由载波传送的三进制代码
A simple binary code transmitted by carrier wave signal.

789
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,250
无线电
Radio.

790
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,880
无线电?
Radio?

791
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:10,260
吉姆 威者要一个答案
Jim, V'Ger expects an answer.

792
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,310
答案? 我不知问题是什么
An answer? I don't know the question.

793
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,980
创造者没有回应
The Creator has not responded.

794
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:36,120
所有行星防御系统都失灵了
All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative!

795
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:20,290
星际舰队说那些装置...
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding

796
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:23,460
准备以等距位置环绕这个行星
toward equidistant positions, orbiting the planet.

797
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,380
是撞击我们的那些东西
They're the same things that hit us.

798
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:28,090
它们的威力强几百倍的
They are hundreds of times more powerful, Captain.

799
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:32,180
它们可从那些位置摧毁整个行星
From those positions, they could devastate the entire surface of the planet.

800
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:49,750
为什么? 创造者没有回答
Why? The Creator has not answered.

801
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:53,740
要从这个行星消除碳化组件侵扰
The carbonunit infestation is to be removed from the Creator's planet.

802
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:57,450
为什么? 你们侵扰进取号
Why? You infest Enterprise.

803
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:00,290
你们同样干扰着创造者
You interfere with the Creator in the same manner.

804
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:10,260
机器!
Machine. V'Ger. V'Ger!

805
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,810
队长
Captain.

806
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:33,070
威者是个小孩 你该这样对待她
V'Ger is a child. I suggest you treat her as such.

807
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,780
小孩? 对 队长 小孩
A child? Yes, Captain. A child.

808
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:39,950
进化 学习 搜寻
Evolving, learning, searching,

809
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,620
本能地有需要 需要什么?
instinctively needing. Needing what?

810
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,500
这小孩快摧毁地球所有生物了
Spock, this child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth.

811
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:53,220
你提议我们怎办? 打它的屁股?
Now what do you suggest we do? Spank it?

812
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,140
它只知道它有需要
It knows only that it needs, Commander,

813
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:04,940
但像我们一样 不知道需要什么
but like so many of us, it does not know what.

814
01:46:18,370 --> 01:46:21,830
碳化组件知道为何创造者没回应
The carbon units know why the Creator has not responded.

815
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:27,540
快说出资料
Disclose the information.

816
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:31,460
威者再撤销环绕第三行星的装置
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet!

817
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,590
队长!
Captain!

818
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:38,680
接收不到星际舰了! 威者干扰
I'm losing Starfleet! Interference from V'Ger!

819
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:44,020
柯克组件 快说出资料
kirk unit, disclose the information.

820
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:47,100
为何创造者没有回应?
Why has the Creator not responded?

821
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:48,690
不说
No.

822
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:55,570
保护所有岗位 撤离舰桥
Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.

823
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,660
撤离舰桥?
Clear the bridge, Captain?

824
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:04,330
这是命令 撤离舰桥 是 长官
That was the order, Mr. Sulu. Clear the bridge! Aye, sir.

825
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:14,920
你的小孩发脾气了 史波克先生
Your child is having a tantrum, Mr. Spock.

826
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,010
威者要那个资料
V'Ger requires the information.

827
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,270
舰桥! 保护所有岗位 快走
Bridge! Secure all stations! Move out!

828
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:27,560
吉姆 这到底是什么策略?
Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this?

829
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:31,690
飞船转为自动操作
All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.

830
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:34,300
威者摧毁进取号
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise,

831
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:35,990
资料也被摧毁
the information that V'Ger requires will also be destroyed!

832
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:40,120
拒给所需资料是合逻辑的
It is illogical to withhold required information.

833
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,240
柯克组件!
kirk unit! kirk unit.

834
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:49,250
为何你不说出资料?
Why do you not disclose information?

835
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,380
威者会摧毁第三行星的碳化组件
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.

836
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:01,770
他们镇压创造者 我不会说出资料的
They have repressed the Creator. The information will not be disclosed!

837
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:04,350
威者需要那些资料
V'Ger needs the information.

838
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:08,310
那么威者要先撤销那些环绕装置
Then V'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices.

839
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:14,730
若碳化组件说出资料 威者同意
V'Ger will comply, if the carbon units will disclose the information.

840
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,370
它学得很快 是不是?
It learns fast, doesn't it?

841
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:26,830
队长 那艘飞船 威者...
Captain, the vessel, V'Ger,

842
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:30,000
很明显是从一个中央脑体运作
obviously operates from a central brain complex.

843
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,630
那些环绕装置是从那个点控制
The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point then?

844
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:35,250
对了
Precisely.

845
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,730
不能把资料说给威者的探测器
The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe,

846
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:51,770
只可直接告诉威者
but only to V'Ger directly.

847
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:18,340
前进 队长 光束
Forward motion, Captain. Tractor beam.

848
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:38,860
队长 下一步怎样?
Captain, what's the next move?

849
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:44,070
问题是 有没有下一步?
The question is, Mr. Decker, is there a next move?

850
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:49,290
返回工作岗位
Resume duty stations.

851
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:52,790
所有人员返回岗位
All personnel, resume stations!

852
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:01,920
戴克先生 看来我的吹牛奏效了
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff has been called.

853
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:06,760
恐怕我们胜算不大
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.

854
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:14,520
那些装置几时到达最后位置?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices reach final position?

855
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,650
二十七分钟 确定
Twentyseven minutes. Mark!

856
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:36,370
队长 我相信那是我们的目的地
Captain, I believe that is our destination. Forward motion, slowing, Captain.

857
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:44,420
进取号外形成了一股氧气引力罩
I read an oxygengravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise.

858
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,180
停下来了 队长
Forward motion, stopped, Captain.

859
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:00,320
威者
V'Ger.

860
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:04,360
我找到威者的无线电讯号来源了
Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal.

861
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,150
就在前面
It's directly ahead.

862
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,910
那发射器是威者和创造者的联系
That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its Creator.

863
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:19,000
碳化组件 现在给威者说出资料
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger with the required information.

864
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,470
史波克? 老骨头?
Mr. Spock? Bones?

865
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:35,770
戴克先生 我每隔五分钟联络你
Mr. Decker, I will contact you every five minutes.

866
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,610
队长 我想跟你一起去
Captain, I'd like to go along.

867
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:47,110
苏鲁先生 你暂代指挥
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

868
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:42,810
威者
V'Ger.

869
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,680
威者
VGER.

870
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:02,680
威者
V'Ger.

871
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:20,070
航海家号
VOYAGER.

872
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:21,370
航海家号!
Voyager!

873
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,420
航海家六号?
Voyager VI!

874
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
美国国家航空航天局
NASA.

875
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:36,340
吉姆 这是三百年前发射的
Jim, this was launched more than 300 years ago.

876
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,680
航海家号系列
Voyager series,

877
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:50,190
负责收集资料和把它传送回地球
designed to collect data and transmit it back to Earth.

878
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:39,470
队长! 航海家六号消失在黑洞中
Captain, Voyager VI disappeared into what they used to call a black hole.

879
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:43,490
它一定是出现在银河系的另一边
It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy

880
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:46,700
再掉进这机械行星的引力场
and fell into the machine planet's gravitational field.

881
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:50,290
那些机械居民以为是它们的同类
The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind.

882
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,960
原始但类似
Primitive, yet kindred.

883
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,340
他们发现它简单的二十世纪程式
They discovered its simple 20thcentury programming.

884
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:59,590
收集所有的资料
"Collect all data possible."

885
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:01,300
尽量学习它
"Learn all that is learnable."

886
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:08,720
把那些资料送返它的创造者 正确 戴克先生
Return that information to its Creator. Precisely, Mr. Decker.

887
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:12,850
那些机器把它逐字解读
The machines interpreted it literally. They built this entire vessel

888
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:15,860
制造这飞船让航海家号完成程式
so that Voyager could actually fulfil its programming.

889
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,360
而在它的回程中
And on its journey back,

890
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:23,110
它积累了大量知识
it amassed so much knowledge,

891
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:26,950
自己有了意识
it achieved consciousness itself.

892
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,450
成为了一个生物
It became a living thing.

893
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:49,140
柯克组件 威者等着那些资料
kirk unit. V'Ger awaits the information.

894
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:55,690
进取号 在船上电脑记录图书馆
Enterprise, order up the ship's computer library of records

895
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:59,320
翻查20世纪太空总署航海家六号
on the late 20th century NASA probe, Voyager VI.

896
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:02,280
我们要那套太空总署
Specifically, we want the old NASA code signal

897
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,740
指示探测器传送资料的旧讯号码
that instructs the probe to transmit its data.

898
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:07,070
乌拉 快点! 是 长官
And fast, Uhura, fast! Aye, sir.

899
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:11,450
它发出准备传送资料的讯号了
That's what it's been signaling! Its readiness to transmit its information!

900
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:13,780
地球没有人懂得
And there's no one on Earth who could

901
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,710
旧讯号和回应
recognize the old signal and send a response.

902
01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:17,670
创造者没有回答
"The Creator does not answer."

903
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:40,320
威者
V'Ger. V'Ger. V'Ger!

904
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,280
我们就是创造者
We are the Creator.

905
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:52,370
不合逻辑 碳组件不是真生物
That is not logical. Carbon units are not true life forms.

906
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:57,670
我们会证明它的 它们会让你可以完成你的程式
We will prove it. We will make it possible for you to complete your programming.

907
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:00,040
只有创造者可以做得到
Only the Creator could accomplish that.

908
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:03,800
进取号
Enterprise.

909
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:06,720
我们刚收到那套回应代码
We have just received the response code, Captain.

910
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,140
把进取号发射器调校至合适频率
Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency

911
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,640
立刻传送那套代码
and transmit the code now!

912
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:14,060
传送中
Transmitting.

913
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:23,820
504, 329, 317, 510,

914
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:25,990
最后的列数是...
and the final sequence...

915
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:28,410
那该可以启动航海家号的发射器
That should trigger Voyager's transmitter.

916
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:43,920
航海家号没有传送它的资料
Voyager is not transmitting its data, Captain.

917
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:48,220
创造者要跟威者结合
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

918
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:53,430
乌拉 重复最后的列数
Uhura! Repeat the final sequence.

919
01:59:58,350 --> 02:00:00,600
创造者要跟威者结合
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

920
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:24,090
航海家号没有传送
Voyager is not transmitting, Captain,

921
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:27,130
因为它接收不到最后的列数
because it did not receive the final sequence.

922
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,880
我们剩下十分钟
Jim! We're down to 10 minutes.

923
02:00:29,970 --> 02:00:31,550
进取号 准备
Enterprise, stand by.

924
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,060
天线引线溶了 刚被威者溶掉
The antenna leads are melted away. Yes, Captain, just now.

925
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:49,860
威者 为什么? 防止接收 当然
By V'Ger itself. Why? To prevent reception.

926
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:57,530
要把创造者带来 亲自完成传送代码
Of course, to bring the Creator here to finish transmitting the code in person.

927
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:03,000
为了接触创造者
To touch the Creator.

928
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:09,970
捕捉神? 威者会大失所望
Capture God? V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment.

929
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:11,550
或者不会
Perhaps not, Doctor.

930
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,370
队长
Captain.

931
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:45,000
威者一定要进化
V'Ger must evolve.

932
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:49,210
它的知识已达到这个宇宙的极限
Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe and it must evolve.

933
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:52,550
它需要的是它的问题的答案
What it requires of its God, Doctor, is the answer to its question,

934
02:01:52,630 --> 02:01:54,130
"还有别的吗?"
"Is there nothing more?"

935
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:56,890
宇宙之外还有什么?
What more is there than the universe, Spock?

936
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:58,970
其他的空间 生物状态
Other dimensions, higher levels of being.

937
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:01,640
它们的存在不能被逻辑性地证明
The existence of which cannot be proven logically.

938
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:04,980
所以威者不能相信它们
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.

939
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:09,900
威者需要人类的品质才能进化
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve is a human quality,

940
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:11,820
我们超越逻辑的能力
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

941
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:18,990
跟它的创造者结合就可以做到
And joining with its Creator might accomplish that.

942
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:23,040
这副机器要亲身跟一个人类结合
You mean, this machine wants to physically join with a human?

943
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:24,580
可能吗?
Is that possible?

944
02:02:28,290 --> 02:02:29,630
我们试试看
Let's find out.

945
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,520
我会经地面测试电脑输入列数
Decker! I'm going to key the final sequence through the ground test computer.

946
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,190
你不知道会有什么后果
Decker, you don't know what that'll do to you!

947
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,600
我知道 医生
Yes, I do, Doctor!

948
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:54,820
戴克 不要!
Decker, don't!

949
02:02:54,900 --> 02:03:01,370
吉姆 像想要进取号般 我要这个
Jim, I want this. As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this.

950
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:56,340
队长
Captain.

951
02:05:58,130 --> 02:06:02,720
史波克! 我们是否看见新生物诞生
Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life form?

952
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,050
是的 我们见证了一次诞生
Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth.

953
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:10,560
它可能是我们进化过程的下一步
Possibly, a next step in our evolution. I wonder.

954
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:13,480
我怀疑...我很久没有接生婴儿了
Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby,

955
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:18,360
希望它有个好开始 但愿如此
and I hope we got this one off to a good start. I hope so, too.

956
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:23,950
我们给了它创造自己目标的能力
I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose

957
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:26,240
凭我们人类的弱点...
out of our own human weaknesses

958
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,370
和克服它们的精神而达成
and the drive that compels us to overcome.

959
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:34,250
还有很多愚蠢的人类感情 是吗
And a lot of foolish human emotions, right, Mr. Spock?

960
02:06:34,330 --> 02:06:39,920
是的 可惜它也要应付它们
Quite true, Doctor. Unfortunately, it will have to deal with them as well.

961
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,830
星际舰队发来疑问
Interrogative from Starfleet.

962
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:45,380
要求损毁和受伤报告
They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status.

963
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:47,760
报告有两人受伤
Report two casualties.

964
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:51,770
伊莉亚中尉 戴克队长
Lieutenant Ilia. Captain Decker.

965
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:55,480
是 长官 更正 他们不是受伤
Aye, sir. Correction. They're not casualties.

966
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:57,480
他们是...
They are...

967
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:01,940
把他们列为失踪吧
List them as missing.

968
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:06,030
飞船运作完全正常 是 长官
Vessel status, fully operational. Aye, sir.

969
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:08,700
史考特先生!
Mr. Scott!

970
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:12,370
我们可要给进取号一次彻底试航
Shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown?

971
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:15,460
是时候那样做了 长官
I would say it's time for that, sir. Aye.

972
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:18,380
我们可在四天内送你去火神星
We can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock.

973
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:23,380
不用了 我在火神星的任务已完
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott. My task on Vulcan is completed.

974
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:28,140
苏鲁先生? 曲速度一级前进 曲速度一级
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1. Warp 1, sir.

975
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:29,760
去哪里 长官?
Heading, sir?

976
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,180
外面
Out there.

977
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,520
那边
That away.
