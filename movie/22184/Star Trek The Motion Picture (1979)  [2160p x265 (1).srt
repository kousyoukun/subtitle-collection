obviously operates from a central brain complex.

985
01:46:48,922 --> 01:46:51,390

The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point, then.

986
01:46:51,558 --> 01:46:53,287
����
Precisely.

987
01:47:02,936 --> 01:47:06,702
���ܰ�����˵�����ߵ�̽����
The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe...

but only to V'Ger directly.

989
01:47:33,066 --> 01:47:35,933

Forward motion, Captain.

990
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:36,615
Tractor beam.

991
01:47:53,753 --> 01:47:56,620

Captain, what's the next move?

992
01:47:58,658 --> 01:48:02,924

The question is, Mr. Decker...

993
01:48:00,806 --> 01:48:02,787
is there a next move?

994
01:48:05,765 --> 01:48:07,528

Resume duty stations.

995

All personnel, resume stations.

996
01:48:15,875 --> 01:48:20,005

Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff has been called.

997
01:48:22,048 --> 01:48:24,539

I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.

998
01:48:29,021 --> 01:48:32,923

Mr. Chekov, when do those devices reach final position?

999
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:36,755
��ʮ�߷��ӣ�ȷ��
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.

1000
01:48:41,845 --> 01:48:45,337

Captain, I believe that is our destination.

1001
01:48:57,522 --> 01:49:02,459

I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise.

Forward motion stopped, Captain.

1003
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:18,065

V'Ger.

1004

Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal.

1005
01:49:22,314 --> 01:49:23,941

It's directly ahead.

1006
01:49:24,116 --> 01:49:27,950

That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its creator.

1007
01:49:31,556 --> 01:49:37,927

The carbon units will now provide V'Ger...

1009
