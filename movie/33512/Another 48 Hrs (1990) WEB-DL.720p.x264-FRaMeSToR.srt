1
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,974
Do you want to have a beer
while you're waiting?

2
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:01,493
Can you hear me, mister?

3
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:07,458
I'll take the bottle.

4
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:23,849
Howdy, boys. What can I do for you?

5
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,188
- Brewskies.
- You got it.

6
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,316
There you go.

7
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:18,951
50 now, 50 more when you're done.

8
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:23,828
- How many?
- Just one.

9
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:29,791
- Another cop?
- No, he's a friend of yours.

10
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,754
You're gonna like this job.

11
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:41,808
He was in my brother's gang.
First he dropped a dime on him...

12
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:47,059
Then he ratted him to the cop
that blew him away.

13
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:05,827
- I'll go in. You want a coke?
- Yeah, diet.

14
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:22,184
We're on Simmons Road off Route 14.

15
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:26,140
I need wants and warrants
on motorcycle registrations.

16
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:33,235
First: California. 6D84S9.
Second plate...

17
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:42,870
- Tom.
- It's nice to see you.

18
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,720
Willie Hickock, right here.

19
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,810
Cherry Ganz.

20
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:08,144
Do I know you guys?

21
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:37,638
- Who are you calling, friend?
- I wasn't calling no one.

22
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,350
- Somehow I don't believe you.
- God, no!

23
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:18,850
$100,000. 50,000 now.
Iceman is a generous guy.

24
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,186
I don't like hundreds.
What kind of shit is this?

25
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,204
This is the guy. We want him dead.

26
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:38,289
Yeah, whatever. No problem.

27
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,460
Police! Freeze!

28
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:56,058
Move a step apart. I don't want anybody
to get hurt here, so move slow.

29
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,967
Shit!

30
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:40,061
Here come the cops,
get out of here!

31
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:17,636
- You really toasted that guy.
- I just shot him. I didn't toast him!

32
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:22,191
Calm down. We'll find the gun.
We've got to do this together.

33
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,275
I checked the guy's locker.
He works at the track.

34
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:31,110
50 bucks in his wallet,
sunglasses and some keys.

35
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:34,323
- We still haven't found his gun.
- Shit!

36
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:39,160
Cates took down one of the locals.
A slug hit one of the gas pumps.

37
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:43,584
He burned the bad guy to a crisp.
Jack claims it was a righteous shoot.

38
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:52,265
I hate these IAD scumbags.

39
00:10:56,396 --> 00:11:02,400
Blake Wilson, Internal Affairs.
I'm always running into you, Jack.

40
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,275
Give us a minute, fellas.

41
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,651
- What did you do now?
- I was on a stakeout.

42
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:15,954
- I was real close to nailing...
- The Iceman, right?

43
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,284
I'm getting real close.
I'll nail these guys.

44
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:22,294
Every case that you can't solve
you pin on the Iceman.

45
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:27,009
The biggest dealer in the Bay Area.
No prints, no description.

46
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,548
You're the only one
who believes he exists.

47
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:34,674
I'll let you in on a secret.
There is no Iceman.

48
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:39,730
Let's get back to the cold facts.
What the hell happened here?

49
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:45,821
I saw an exchange. I moved in.
He shot. I shot back.

50
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:51,614
- You got the bad guy's gun?
- It's got to be in the ashes.

51
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,748
- Cruise, what have you got?
- Some burnt metal off the pump.

52
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:05,796
- No gun?
- No, no gun.

53
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:10,887
A cop is a guy,
and a guy sometimes steps on his dick.

54
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,511
Do you think maybe
you were pushing too hard?

55
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:17,772
Did you step on your dick?

56
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:21,891
He had a piece.
He shot. I shot back.

57
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:30,036
Have the lab boys go over every inch of
this place. If there's a gun here I want it.

58
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:36,081
- See you around, Jack.
- Yeah.

59
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,494
Reggie Hammond.

60
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,309
You must be a real dangerous convict.

61
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:45,155
- You made me miss, cop.
- You're looking good, Reggie.

62
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,828
I ain't seen you in years.
We were friends.

63
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,913
- I'm sorry. I've been busy.
- Me, too.

64
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:59,123
What are you doing here?
You even got a new haircut.

65
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:04,175
- Times change.
- You lost a couple of pounds.

66
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:06,422
I quit drinking.

67
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,925
Have you come to tell me
my sentence got increased?

68
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:16,442
No, you're still getting out tomorrow,
and we've got a little job to do.

69
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:21,355
When I get out of here,
give me my money and walk away.

70
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:25,196
I played that cop shit once
and it don't work.

71
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:31,822
If you don't help me, I'm not ever
gonna give you your money back.

72
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:35,666
- You're fucking with me?
- No.

73
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:40,749
I gave you that money in good faith.
I trusted you.

74
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:45,672
- Now you're telling me I can't have it?
- Now you've got the picture, convict.

75
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:59,314
- You screwed up this time, Hammond.
- It was self-defense.

76
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:03,782
I served two years for a crime I did.
I never denied that.

77
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:08,163
But I've just done five years
for a robbery I didn't do.

78
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,835
- Murderers do less time than me.
- Put him in isolation.

79
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,043
Open up.

80
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:48,538
<i>Roxanne!</i>

81
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:52,870
<i>You don't have to put on the red light</i>

82
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:59,582
<i>those days are over</i>
<i>don't sell your body to the night... </i>

83
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:43,179
Tequila... The bottle.

84
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:54,271
- Do you guys want anything?
- Whiskey.

85
00:16:56,362 --> 00:17:00,442
Mr. Price, the man is distressed.

86
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:06,038
That mess out in the desert makes him
wonder if your boys can finish the job.

87
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:08,993
Not to worry.

88
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:12,702
Real pros? Not from where I'm sitting.

89
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:18,467
Don't get the heat all jacked up
when you're doing a job.

90
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:22,883
If you want to be an outlaw,
there ain't no rules.

91
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:28,182
- Is that your philosophy?
- We're the only real Americans left.

92
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:32,601
We believe in freedom.
We live the way folks used to.

93
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:39,028
Before big cities, lawyers, computers
with your name in them. Free!

94
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:43,327
The rest of you
are just a bunch of fucking slaves.

95
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,323
That's real interesting, Mr. Price.
Maybe you should run for office.

96
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,992
I'm supposed to tell you
to take precautions.

97
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,373
Your backup
got barbecued at a racetrack.

98
00:17:56,092 --> 00:18:00,137
- You know what to do with that?
- No problem here, friend.

99
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,674
- I used to be a Marine.
- I guess that figures.

100
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,225
If you have any trouble, come to me.
You know the number.

101
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,687
Hey, come here.

102
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:21,775
You got the wrong girl.
I don't do that.

103
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:25,820
Come on.
My friend and I just came into town.

104
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:31,242
We're looking for a whore that works
here. Her name's Angel.

105
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:33,877
She's dancing up in North Beach.

106
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,711
- How about you?
- I'm getting tired of this. Let go!

107
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:43,550
- I'll call the cops.
- Go ahead, call them.

108
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:49,598
Let's hit the road, boys.
Come on, Cherry.

109
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:01,406
In the matter of the shooting
at Hunter's Point Raceway -

110
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:05,576
- of Arthur Brock,
resident of San Francisco, -

111
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:10,826
- the review board has
carefully examined the evidence -

112
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:16,165
- and determined that the officer
in question, Inspector Jack Cates, -

113
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:18,087
- had insufficient probable cause.

114
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:25,760
In view of the ongoing investigation
by the Internal Affairs Division, -

115
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:31,062
- this review board's ruling is that
the shooting was a wrongful action.

116
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:43,413
They landed on you hard.

117
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:50,083
You'll be prosecuted for manslaughter.
I wish they'd found that gun.

118
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:55,047
I'm sorry, Jack. I'm just doing my job.

119
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,969
Your profile reads: "An obsessed cop
with a record of stepping over the line. "

120
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,810
It's quite likely the DA will choose
to prosecute you on third degree.

121
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:12,774
- In other words, you're screwed.
- Unless I find the Iceman.

122
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:18,652
- Give it up, Jack.
- Jesus Christ, you sound like Wilson.

123
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:22,991
We're talking about facts here.
You've got no leads.

124
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,204
This is manslaughter.
Protect yourself.

125
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:54,604
Hammond, let's go.
It's a big day for you today.

126
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:58,032
- Just get me out of here.
- Yeah, yeah.

127
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:15,755
Reggie.

128
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,930
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

129
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,726
You will keep your promise?

130
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:28,149
Everything is cool.

131
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:32,529
That white cop that was here,
is he a problem?

132
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:37,406
No!
I promise you, everything is cool.

133
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:41,871
But it might take
a little longer than I said it would.

134
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,201
Don't bullshit me.
Get that money and keep your word.

135
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:53,334
I kept you alive in this rat hole
for five years.

136
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:57,805
I can get you out there.
I can pull your fucking heart out.

137
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:12,025
- What was all that about?
- An old football bet.

138
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,732
That's a crock.
Hammond, Reggie A.

139
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:21,827
$100 cash and a free bus ride
to San Francisco.

140
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:26,044
- All compliments of the state.
- That's it?

141
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,462
Thank you for sparing me
the other crap.

142
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,919
Don't slam my shit down like that.

143
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:42,932
Where's my James Brown tape?
The shit ain't in here.

144
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:45,774
Nobody keeps me and James in prison.

145
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:58,532
- We didn't finish our conversation.
- Get me my fucking money.

146
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:01,991
You're not getting your money
unless you help me.

147
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:06,995
I trusted you with my money
and my car, and you fucked me.

148
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:10,376
There's a drug dealer
called the Iceman.

149
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:15,427
Last week I found out
that he wants you dead.

150
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:21,553
I got this off some guy
being paid to make a hit on you.

151
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,766
In four years,
you're the best lead I ever had.

152
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:29,520
Yeah? I ain't helping you
while you got my money.

153
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:35,817
You let me rot in prison for five years
and then show up wanting help?

154
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:39,779
This time it's gonna be different.

155
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:45,165
I'm going to lose my badge.
They're gonna put me in jail.

156
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:48,255
You're in trouble with the law? Good!

157
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:53,300
As bad as I feel about losing
my money, that makes me feel better.

158
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,879
I don't beg!

159
00:23:56,057 --> 00:24:01,348
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
I'm the best lead you ever had.

160
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:05,851
I'll come and visit you
in about five or six years.

161
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,942
- Let's go.
- We got a schedule.

162
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:22,163
- I'm not on the state's time no more.
- Write a letter.

163
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:51,529
The big fucker in the blue Caddy,
that's the pig who wasted my brother.

164
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,535
This is great, man. I get them both.

165
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:24,229
<i>Hit me</i>

166
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:31,317
<i>I want to kiss myself</i>
<i>good God</i>

167
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:33,950
<i>I've got the feeling</i>

168
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:41,710
<i>baby, baby, baby</i>

169
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,499
<i>baby, baby, baby... </i>

170
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,040
Get down!

171
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,296
I'm going west on Highway 50.

172
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:32,965
Get some help here, right now!

173
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,616
Let's go.

174
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:33,057
Come on.

175
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:39,687
Come on!

176
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:03,751
You've fractured your left clavicle.

177
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:06,638
Blood trauma broke the skin.

178
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:12,352
- You always wear a bullet-proof vest?
- Only when I see my friends.

179
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:16,892
I want you to change the bandage
on your chest every hour.

180
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:24,312
I have to immobilize this arm.
Wear this sling.

181
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:29,154
- Where are you going?
- I've got police business.

182
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,743
I was minding my own business,
then those bikers started shooting.

183
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:36,623
- The x-rays are fine.
- My head is still hurting.

184
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:43,927
- You had a bus roll over on you.
- You might have a slight concussion.

185
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:47,679
- We're going to hold you overnight.
- You ain't holding me overnight.

186
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,889
I'm going home. I ain't spending
my first day out in no hospital.

187
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:58,644
- You never saw those bikers before?
- All you rednecks look alike to me.

188
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,063
- Keep on him, Art.
- Great, Art the goddamn redneck.

189
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:08,821
I was coming out of the kitchen
with this guy's breakfast.

190
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:13,873
He looked funny. Not just hungry,
but like he's mad at something.

191
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:19,086
The next thing there's gunshots
and the windows breaking...

192
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:24,680
- Hammond, when can I see him?
- I've got to keep him overnight.

193
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:29,260
That's one lucky guy.
I'd like to follow him around a racetrack.

194
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:35,106
You know what he was in the joint for?
That son of a bitch is a child molester.

195
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:39,854
He's involved in kiddie porn. I've got
to get him to San Francisco tonight.

196
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:45,867
He can identify the kingpin. If I don't get
him back tonight, the kingpin walks.

197
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:53,247
You want to go for a ride in a Cadillac?

198
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,667
I've been having a fucked-up day.

199
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,044
I'm just trying to help you out.

200
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:05,348
You could always catch a bus.
You had a lot of luck on the last one.

201
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,470
Do me a favor. Stay away from me.

202
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:11,764
I'm sorry, Reg.
They released you in my custody.

203
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,238
Have you seen those bikers before?
- Where's my money?

204
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:29,239
You tell me why the Iceman
wants you dead, you'll get your money.

205
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:33,877
- Ask the guy you got my picture off.
- I killed him.

206
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:37,629
- Do they pay you by the pound?
- He shot at me first.

207
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,877
- Only we can't find his gun.
- Are you looking for sympathy?

208
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,891
I'm supposed to be in Florida
running my uncle's used-car business.

209
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:52,596
Instead I'm broke, I was shot at, I was
in a bus that flipped over 20 times, -

210
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:57,982
- I broke my walkman and I was hit
by a big truck. So leave me alone.

211
00:33:58,155 --> 00:34:02,532
Life's tough. I ran into your friends, too.
They shot me in the chest six times.

212
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:06,486
- You don't look bad for a dead man.
- I was wearing one of these.

213
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:10,662
- Why?
- I knew I was going to see you.

214
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:15,877
I wouldn't want to get killed by
a stray bullet that was meant for you.

215
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:18,670
You think I should get one?

216
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:25,096
They run about $750. That's more than
they gave you when they let you out.

217
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:31,353
- I hope you got my Porsche.
- I said I'd take real good care of it.

218
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:35,189
That don't mean nothing. You said
we had a deal and you fucked me.

219
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:40,237
You fucked yourself.
You stole the prison payroll.

220
00:34:40,408 --> 00:34:43,742
- I checked into it.
- I was framed.

221
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:49,582
Yeah, some convict got a guard
to put the money in your cell.

222
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:53,120
- Sure you got framed.
- What about you?

223
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:57,342
They never found that guy's gun
out at the racetrack.

224
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:04,972
- I'm a cop. You're a crook.
- So everything I say is a goddamn lie?

225
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:08,097
Just take me to my car.
I'm through with you.

226
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:12,980
What's wrong, does your arm hurt?
Does it hurt bad? Good.

227
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:17,279
We've got a problem here, slick.

228
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:23,320
I didn't hire these hillbillies,
so don't come complaining to me.

229
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:27,363
Yes, plan B.
We've got an ex-Marine on the case.

230
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:32,369
The only problem is, he's a hillbilly too.

231
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,038
Right, later.

232
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:47,306
- How much money did you spend?
- About 25 grand.

233
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:51,263
- You said I could buy a new car.
- Where is it?

234
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:56,151
- This is a new car.
- This is the same old piece of shit.

235
00:35:56,322 --> 00:36:01,317
I bought the same model, year, color.
That's the way I like it.

236
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:04,531
You got the same car, same clothes.

237
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,742
- You got the same girl, too?
- Elaine?

238
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:12,295
- Hell, I don't want to talk about this.
- Good, keep it all balled up.

239
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:18,083
She married me about five years ago
at City Hall.

240
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:21,880
She figured she'd settle me down.

241
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:24,465
This was where we lived
till we split up.

242
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:30,231
I want to sell it. 12 grand
of yours went for the down payment.

243
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,403
How could you leave my car outside?
What if somebody stole it?

244
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:40,785
I had a lock put on it.
Just push this blue button.

245
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:45,662
You have no appreciation
whatsoever of what's hype.

246
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:49,036
You know how much pussy
I got because of that car?

247
00:36:58,221 --> 00:36:59,929
They blew up my car!

248
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:05,223
- They blew up my car!
- That's a damn shame.

249
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:12,149
- That's all you've got to say?
- You're having a bad day.

250
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:15,688
I'm through with you.
I'm calling some of my homies.

251
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:18,782
I'm getting a loan. I'm stepping off!

252
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:30,793
Buster, what's up? Reggie Hammond.

253
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:34,713
Yes, my brother!
I'm out. I'm on the street again.

254
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,088
Yeah, cool. Listen...

255
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:44,598
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna do that.
That's why I'm calling. I need a loan.

256
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:50,311
I know I owe you some shit,
but I just got out of jail.

257
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:54,862
Listen... I don't have collateral.
I just got out of jail.

258
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:59,824
I don't need collateral,
this is Reggie Hammond.

259
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:03,281
Hey, Buster? Buster...?

260
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:19,631
- We heard your house blew up.
- Not my house. A car.

261
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:25,015
- Your car blew up?
- No, some guy who parked out front.

262
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:29,186
- Anything come in on those bikers?
- No, I'll check again.

263
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:36,241
You've got to see Wilson. If you don't,
he'll send someone to get you.

264
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:41,455
Jack, are you okay?

265
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:58,010
You giving him a ticket?
Good, he hates cops.

266
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:01,467
- He does?
- Yeah.

267
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:05,594
He said cops are pussies
who hide behind their badges.

268
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:09,853
He said he didn't care
if it was a no-parking zone.

269
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:13,978
He said
that any cop could kiss his ass.

270
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:18,786
Your friend's not too smart.

271
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,374
He's a big dumb-ass cop
named Jack Cates.

272
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:27,039
Tell Cates to stop parking here.

273
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:37,214
Hello, Jack.

274
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,183
The motorcycle track, then the diner,
and now a bomb at your house.

275
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:45,224
The Iceman has been busy.

276
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:49,859
I'm not here to argue with you.
I'm here to support you.

277
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:54,987
However, as supervisor of
Internal Affairs, I have to tell you -

278
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,951
- that you're on suspension
until the hearing tomorrow.

279
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:03,990
So give me that gun
and badge and police ID.

280
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,660
Yeah, right.

281
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,622
I'll bet you think I enjoy this.

282
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:16,674
Do me a favor,
go home and get some sleep.

283
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:25,770
I've got to go
and make out some reports.

284
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:31,612
I don't mind people checking up
on cops. We're not above the law.

285
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:36,408
But making cops do it is bad
for morale. It's bad for cops.

286
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:42,248
Civilians ought to do it.
You're a real chickenshit, Wilson.

287
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:49,299
Maybe it's not your fault.
Maybe it's your job.

288
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,265
All right.

289
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:27,546
Yo, Marvin, what's up?
Reggie Hammond... Hammond.

290
00:41:27,715 --> 00:41:32,176
How are you doing? I just got out.

291
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:37,221
What? You're a born-again Christian.
Get the fuck out of here.

292
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:40,347
I can't picture you
as a born-again Christian.

293
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:42,810
I saw you beat the bitch up.

294
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:47,145
No, everybody can find Jesus.
I love Jesus.

295
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,065
I love Jesus.
Hello...?

296
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:57,782
Willie Biggs! Reggie Hammond.
Hello...? Black motherfucker!

297
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:07,916
13 complaints involving biker types
in the last four days.

298
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:12,255
- Two traffics. One D&D in North Beach.
- Run these guys through NCIC.

299
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:17,555
I'll have Cruise do it.
He don't look much like a biker to me.

300
00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:20,354
Nice talking to you.

301
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:30,279
- Are you still here?
- I ain't happy about it.

302
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:36,322
I'm supposed to be free, getting on
with my life, not tied to your dumb ass.

303
00:42:36,497 --> 00:42:40,709
- Welcome back.
- Get off me. I ain't no convict.

304
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:46,381
I'm a free man. You're close to where
I was yesterday. You ain't running shit.

305
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:50,049
I ain't working for you
and I don't like you.

306
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,218
Cut the bullshit.
Give me something I can use.

307
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:58,305
The Iceman bought your house.

308
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:04,149
- Cut the bullshit!
- You still ain't put this shit together.

309
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:10,024
Me and Ganz took half a million dollars
from the Iceman. He's still pissed off.

310
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:14,485
It's amazing how money
affects some people.

311
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:18,078
Yes, the man you've been looking for
all this time -

312
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:24,668
- bought your fuck-up car and put
a down payment on your house.

313
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,589
That makes you probably the dumbest
motherfucker in law enforcement.

314
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:34,846
I'm driving.
I, unlike you, have a lot to live for.

315
00:43:41,024 --> 00:43:43,431
I always wanted a chauffeur.

316
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,479
I recognized one of those bikers
who attacked the bus. Cherry Ganz.

317
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:53,608
He's Ganz' brother.
He made Ganz look like Gandhi.

318
00:43:53,787 --> 00:44:00,040
- Why would the Iceman hire him?
- I helped you kill his brother.

319
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:04,540
Ganz said his brother
used to fuck this bitch named Angel.

320
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:11,964
- She worked at Barnstormers.
- We got a complaint from there.

321
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,474
Are the cops actually contributing
to this investigation?

322
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:19,642
How do you remember all this
after seven years in prison?

323
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:24,607
In prison you remember every
story about pussy you ever heard.

324
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:35,320
Wait, I got to get something.

325
00:44:36,332 --> 00:44:39,286
Jack, this shit is fake.

326
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:42,331
I'll flash it fast.

327
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:47,549
If somebody spots that fake ID,
you'll get your ass kicked.

328
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,804
You just watch your own ass.

329
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:22,291
I'll go question the barmaid
who called in the complaint.

330
00:45:22,465 --> 00:45:26,048
You do your cop shit.
I'll check out these whores.

331
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:42,527
Hey! Are you the one who called
to complain about some bikers?

332
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:46,906
You finally responded.
It's only been a day and a half.

333
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:52,032
- Are you gonna keep bitching?
- You're never here when we need you.

334
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:57,951
Can I have a shot of Stoli?
How are you doing?

335
00:45:58,127 --> 00:46:01,746
- Buy me a drink?
- I just got out of jail. I'm broke.

336
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:04,165
- But you can buy my drink.
- Fuck off.

337
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:16,391
I know you, right?
You broke my heart once.

338
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:18,565
- I won't let you get away this time.
- I'll be right back.

339
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:24,735
I just have to powder my nose.

340
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:43,549
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Pretty good. How are you?

341
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:50,800
Did you ever see
those commercials on TV -

342
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:56,314
- where they show people getting
their pockets picked in slow-motion?

343
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:03,028
- Shit!
- Shit is a good word to say there.

344
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:06,530
- I can get your money back.
- For how much?

345
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,532
- I figure about half your money.
- Half? Give me a break.

346
00:47:10,705 --> 00:47:14,370
I'm giving you a break.
You ain't got nothing now.

347
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:18,326
She'll use your credit cards.
Your credit will be all fucked up.

348
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:22,123
- If you don't want it, fuck you.
- Deal.

349
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:27,971
He starts asking me about a girl
that worked here. He gets real rough.

350
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,758
- Then the blonde one pulls out a gun.
- What about this girl?

351
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:36,930
Angel. She dances at
The Bird Cage up in North Beach.

352
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:42,233
- Why aren't you writing this down?
- Good memory. You got her address?

353
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:04,418
- This is the ladies' room.
- Mind your own business.

354
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:14,270
I thought we should get to know
each other. You're very smooth.

355
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:17,393
I've seen a lot of pockets get picked
and I've never seen no one smoother.

356
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:24,614
That guy is so upset. I told him
I could get him half his money back.

357
00:48:24,783 --> 00:48:30,573
If you offer me a bribe,
I could tell him you were too fast for me.

358
00:48:30,748 --> 00:48:33,583
I am too fast for you.

359
00:48:40,008 --> 00:48:42,878
Almost finished.

360
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:50,933
- Anybody else with them?
- No, just the three of them.

361
00:48:51,103 --> 00:48:56,014
There was this skinny black guy.
The oldest was talking to him.

362
00:48:56,191 --> 00:49:00,770
Black guy?
Was he something like this?

363
00:49:00,947 --> 00:49:06,701
Yeah, that's him.
He was okay, he didn't bother me.

364
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:12,493
If they come in again, call the police
and ask for Inspector Kehoe.

365
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:17,667
- Here's half your money.
- Where are my credit cards?

366
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,466
The deal was for the money.
Your cards are in the bathroom.

367
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:49,492
- Jack Cates. Remember me?
- I don't think so.

368
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:52,785
You busted me in the back seat
of a Camero with a girl.

369
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,124
- That don't sound like me.
- It turns out she was under age.

370
00:49:57,298 --> 00:50:01,378
- Shit happens.
- I didn't steal that car, my buddy did.

371
00:50:01,553 --> 00:50:06,381
- You ought to pick better buddies.
- I got two years.

372
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:09,429
I don't wanna get into a bar fight.

373
00:50:09,603 --> 00:50:13,435
People always get into bar fights,
it's a cliché.

374
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:16,857
You see it in the motion pictures.

375
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:22,900
People get kicked in the head,
beer bottles and furniture...

376
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:19,843
I'm taking two years out of your ass!

377
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:23,095
Have you got a gun?

378
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,894
All right, knock this shit off.

379
00:51:39,073 --> 00:51:43,984
I have been having a bad day.
I just got out of jail.

380
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:49,452
Already I've been shot at. I was
on a bus that flipped over 17 times.

381
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:56,423
A bitch tried to stab me
and somebody blew up my Porsche.

382
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,427
I usually don't jump in
when somebody's getting beat down, -

383
00:51:59,595 --> 00:52:02,761
- but Jack Cates
is helping me straighten things out.

384
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:08,519
- Now let us go about our business.
- Because you've got a gun?

385
00:52:08,687 --> 00:52:14,442
- Because I'll pop a cap in your ass.
- You don't have the guts to use it.

386
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:24,489
Anybody else want a limp?

387
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:31,662
Sorry about the kneecap.
I got a little excited.

388
00:52:31,837 --> 00:52:35,835
- You blew that investigation.
- You disappeared on me.

389
00:52:36,008 --> 00:52:42,011
- I didn't know I'd have to save your ass.
- I didn't need your help.

390
00:52:42,432 --> 00:52:46,560
I should've had my spare gun.

391
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:51,224
Then I get in a bar fight.
Jesus, Jack, what are you doing?

392
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,484
- Hey!
- What was that for?

393
00:52:54,653 --> 00:52:59,114
That was for the basketball.
Now we're even, we can start fresh.

394
00:52:59,283 --> 00:53:02,319
I got to get out of here.
The deal is off.

395
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:06,824
- Fuck this!
- Bullshit. Get in the car.

396
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:10,543
Were you born a shithead
or did you take lessons?

397
00:53:10,712 --> 00:53:14,626
Don't take it so damn personal.

398
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:20,256
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Don't be stupid.

399
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,508
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.

400
00:53:25,686 --> 00:53:30,597
Your tip turned out okay. Ganz' lady
lives down at the King Mei Hotel.

401
00:53:31,901 --> 00:53:36,195
Bye, Jack.
Fuck you, Jack.

402
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:41,574
Shit!

403
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:57,087
Here's the story on one of the bikers.

404
00:53:57,261 --> 00:54:01,840
Ganz, Richard. Member of the
Western Brotherhood motorcycle gang.

405
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:06,346
7 outstanding warrants.
72 outstanding traffic violations.

406
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:11,860
- L.A. Bike gangs?
- <i>Yeah. </i> LA<i>PD has more coming in. </i>

407
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:15,859
- <i>I'll be right over. </i>
- The man is on suspension.

408
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:19,566
That ain't a good idea.
Wilson's here.

409
00:54:19,743 --> 00:54:22,828
Christ! He heard about the bar.

410
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:25,570
<i>Be out front with everything you got. </i>

411
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,122
15 minutes.

412
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:34,583
Kehoe, get in.

413
00:54:41,975 --> 00:54:47,562
- Give me that. You steer.
- Jesus Christ!

414
00:54:49,775 --> 00:54:54,437
- Hickcock. Ganz.
- That's Albert Ganz' brother.

415
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:59,075
They're cop killers.
They capped two cops, five days ago.

416
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:04,036
Special Investigations says
they're enforcers for their gang.

417
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:08,122
They've been linked to over 15 deaths.
Brake!

418
00:55:10,047 --> 00:55:13,961
- Got anything else?
- No, nothing hard.

419
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:19,546
- Just go round the block.
- Too easy.

420
00:55:28,483 --> 00:55:32,979
Kirkland Smith, you got a phone call.
Reggie Hammond.

421
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:42,872
- Reggie, is it done?
- It's a bit more complicated...

422
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,658
Don't mess with me.
You ain't a citizen no more.

423
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:51,165
You can't vote. Nobody will hire you.
You're outcast.

424
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:55,718
All you've got left is your word.
Don't break your word to me.

425
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:30,996
Nice place. What took you so long?

426
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:37,094
I thought you quit again.
What is it, you can't stay away?

427
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:41,558
I'm gonna hang and
we're gonna straighten this shit out.

428
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,645
But if you hit me again,
if you grab me...

429
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:48,100
If your hand brushes up against me...

430
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:52,938
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I'm gonna treat you right.

431
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:58,489
I'll let you get away with this shit
'cause you're in pain. Which arm is it?

432
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:03,787
My left. The doc says it's bruised
down to the bone.

433
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:09,748
- Now we're even!
- I just got even for the basketball.

434
00:57:09,924 --> 00:57:12,498
Give me my money back,
then you can hit me with a ball.

435
00:57:14,178 --> 00:57:19,553
Wait a minute.
Let's just go and talk to this girl.

436
00:57:19,726 --> 00:57:24,554
- Don't snake me, Jack.
- We're just gonna talk to her.

437
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:29,358
This is just straight-ahead cop stuff.

438
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,152
Thank you...

439
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,813
So when is Cherry coming over?

440
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:15,198
Don't worry, he'll be by.

441
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:24,581
He said you were real nice.
He was right.

442
00:58:33,262 --> 00:58:37,177
- We never hear of her.
- Heard of her now?

443
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:42,475
- A fake badge. My kid has one of those.
- Has your kid got one of these?

444
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:53,073
Angel Lee is upstairs.
Fourth floor. 4B.

445
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:57,740
She may not have even seen him.

446
00:58:57,914 --> 00:59:01,034
He's in town for a hit,
not to pop his old girlfriend.

447
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:06,452
- Yes, he will.
- You wait here. I'll go up and see her.

448
00:59:06,631 --> 00:59:10,499
I ain't waiting down here.
What do I do if those bikers show up?

449
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:14,722
You've got a pistol. Stay here.
I'll go up.

450
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:21,094
- You want this badge?
- I won't run into any kids up there.

451
01:01:08,093 --> 01:01:12,637
- Yeah, who is it?
- <i>Pizza delivery for Miss Angel. </i>

452
01:01:12,807 --> 01:01:19,391
- I didn't order any pizza.
- Room 4B. Miss Angel.

453
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:24,560
Hang on. I've got to get something on.

454
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:28,526
She's naked!

455
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:35,073
I didn't order any pizza.

456
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,473
No fucking way!

457
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:09,029
You're fucking dead! I killed you!

458
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:15,035
You can't be alive.
I already killed you.

459
01:02:26,468 --> 01:02:27,844
Call for help now!

460
01:02:31,974 --> 01:02:36,268
What is going on?
Where are you going?

461
01:03:00,338 --> 01:03:04,549
You killed my family, pig.
I'm gonna kill you.

462
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:09,170
Get out of here!

463
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:15,717
Fucking pig!
Motherfucking pig!

464
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:28,697
- Cherry, get your ass up here.
- Fucking die!

465
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:34,790
Come on.

466
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:49,131
Come on.

467
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:53,048
They're out back!

468
01:04:24,802 --> 01:04:26,510
Down the alley.

469
01:05:02,426 --> 01:05:07,420
We got the perimeter secured. I haven't
got a statement from Jack yet.

470
01:05:07,598 --> 01:05:10,433
I don't know whose gun he used.

471
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:15,678
I'll get the statement from him.

472
01:05:15,856 --> 01:05:21,017
- You're in deep shit.
- Tell me something I don't know.

473
01:05:21,195 --> 01:05:27,733
- NCIC has no match on this guy.
- That figures.

474
01:05:37,755 --> 01:05:41,290
You're looking at accessory to murder.

475
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:46,046
You'll get ten years inside,
and that's with good behavior.

476
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:49,887
Co-operate with us
and you might walk.

477
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:53,725
I want to talk to a lawyer.

478
01:05:53,897 --> 01:05:59,982
Are you in love with this guy Cherry?
I can certainly understand that.

479
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:07,153
He blows through town twice a year.
He lets his friends jump on you.

480
01:06:07,328 --> 01:06:09,866
I understand why
you're in love with him.

481
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:14,333
They move around a lot.
I can never get in touch with them.

482
01:06:14,502 --> 01:06:18,880
- Who can?
- I don't know. Those guys are nuts.

483
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:20,424
This is Officer Jack Cates.

484
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:29,721
Miss Lee was about to give us
the name of Mr. Cherry's contact man.

485
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:39,605
The guy's name is Malcolm Price.
He's big, spooky eyes.

486
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:42,614
Nobody talks to Cherry
unless they talk to him first.

487
01:06:44,242 --> 01:06:48,904
- Where do we find this guy?
- I don't know.

488
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:53,292
I swear. I only know a name.

489
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,754
- Thanks, babe.
- Hey, wait a minute.

490
01:07:03,971 --> 01:07:11,268
- Where are you going?
- Have Kehoe run a Malcolm Price.

491
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:18,853
- He'll have a record. We're out of here.
- Your ass is gonna be grass.

492
01:07:22,157 --> 01:07:24,197
I'm headed for an early funeral.

493
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:29,196
If the Iceman gets you,
we won't even find your body.

494
01:07:29,373 --> 01:07:33,585
We need somebody
who knows about this shit.

495
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:37,798
- We should go back to prison.
- Bullshit.

496
01:07:37,966 --> 01:07:43,506
You want to know about Price.
I know a guy who can finger him.

497
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,844
You should go to prison anyway,
to find out if you're going to like it.

498
01:07:48,018 --> 01:07:52,846
Get reacquainted with the guys
whose rights you've violated.

499
01:07:53,023 --> 01:07:55,894
I only arrest crooks.

500
01:07:56,068 --> 01:08:01,655
You make it sound like crook was the
only job these guys were qualified for.

501
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:07,329
That's a real good story.
Blame it on society.

502
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:12,622
If shit was worth something, poor
people would be born with no assholes.

503
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:22,127
It's me. I heard about it.

504
01:08:22,304 --> 01:08:26,801
I warned you about dealing
with these crazy-ass crackers.

505
01:08:26,976 --> 01:08:31,804
No, I ain't carrying. That ain't my thing.

506
01:08:31,981 --> 01:08:36,275
I'm a businessman, too, but I don't
want to get too close to these guys.

507
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:42,364
These guys have taken
all of the fun out of my work.

508
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:44,823
I remember.

509
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:49,492
You don't have to remind me.

510
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:53,747
Don't worry, I'll pull it together.

511
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,392
Kirkland, you've got some visitors.

512
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:52,306
Get that picture of the guy.

513
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:03,823
A small-time dealer named Burroughs,
he was recruited by the Iceman.

514
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:09,037
Do you know anything about
the dude he works for, Malcolm Price?

515
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:12,294
I know him.
Western Brotherhood.

516
01:10:12,463 --> 01:10:16,046
If you want a hit done,
you've got to go through Price.

517
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:20,418
- Have you got an address?
- Look it up.

518
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:27,596
Sunset Motel on the Beltway.
Give the phone back to Reggie.

519
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:32,979
What's his problem? Do you mind?
I'm trying to talk to the brother here.

520
01:10:35,237 --> 01:10:40,861
Can you excuse us?
The brother wants to talk. Black stuff.

521
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:44,985
- It's private.
- You mind?

522
01:10:45,164 --> 01:10:48,534
Can you go over there?

523
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,581
- It's private.
- All right.

524
01:10:51,755 --> 01:10:58,422
Look, now I've given you something
you need... for the second time.

525
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:02,676
Yes, and I appreciate your patience
and thank you.

526
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:06,551
You will... repay your debt to me!

527
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:27,870
Hey, man, not to worry.
We got lots of back-up.

528
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:31,671
Come on in and have a drink.

529
01:11:52,361 --> 01:11:54,816
Malcolm Price.

530
01:11:55,864 --> 01:12:00,859
It must have been a real good lead.
Somebody shot him 16 times.

531
01:12:01,037 --> 01:12:07,704
I've been chasing the Iceman
for years. It's always a dead end.

532
01:12:07,877 --> 01:12:11,709
- This job will drive you crazy.
- Yeah, yeah...

533
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,876
- Jack, the Iceman is a cop.
- No way.

534
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:20,297
Put this shit together.

535
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,558
You call for Price's address.
The Iceman shows up first.

536
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:29,851
- It's a coincidence. Bad luck.
- It's no coincidence.

537
01:12:30,026 --> 01:12:33,276
And the brother
whose picture you had?

538
01:12:33,446 --> 01:12:37,776
You've got to run
a mugshot through NCIC.

539
01:12:37,951 --> 01:12:42,494
- How long does that take?
- Hours... sometimes it's slow.

540
01:12:42,664 --> 01:12:48,917
You know why the Iceman wants to kill
me? It has nothing to do with money.

541
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:54,082
He wants to kill me because
I've seen him. I can blow his cover.

542
01:12:54,260 --> 01:13:00,345
Find out which guy is putting up
the most resistance to you on this.

543
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:03,550
That is probably the Iceman.

544
01:13:03,728 --> 01:13:08,604
It has to be Wilson. That prick
has been dogging my ass for years.

545
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:11,942
Ever since I started looking
for the Iceman.

546
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:15,861
I've got to get you over to the hearing
to ID this guy.

547
01:13:16,033 --> 01:13:21,739
They might decide to put me away
for good. It started two hours ago.

548
01:13:21,914 --> 01:13:25,330
After the incident
with Inspector Cates, -

549
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:30,210
- he dredged up this idea of a criminal
mastermind running the Bay Area.

550
01:13:30,381 --> 01:13:34,676
For four years he has wasted
resources and manpower -

551
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:38,261
- in trying to vindicate
himself and his theories.

552
01:13:38,432 --> 01:13:42,015
Describe his professional attitude.

553
01:13:43,145 --> 01:13:48,851
When an officer takes it upon himself
to violate department regulations -

554
01:13:49,026 --> 01:13:52,277
- it makes it hard
for a good cop to do his job.

555
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:57,275
Objection. These remarks have
nothing to do with the incident at hand.

556
01:13:57,452 --> 01:14:00,903
I'm trying to show
a pattern of behavior -

557
01:14:01,081 --> 01:14:05,161
- that will illuminate the events
at Hunter's Point Raceway.

558
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:08,040
I'll let the testimony stand.

559
01:14:29,194 --> 01:14:33,026
After the preliminary evidence
provided by the state, -

560
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:39,700
- and in adherence to laws specified
by the State of California...

561
01:14:39,872 --> 01:14:45,115
- There he is!
- Order! This is a judicial hearing.

562
01:14:46,045 --> 01:14:48,832
- No, it's some other guy.
- No, right there!

563
01:14:49,007 --> 01:14:51,712
That's not him.

564
01:14:51,885 --> 01:14:55,336
- Who are these men?
- That, Your Honor, is Inspector Cates.

565
01:14:55,513 --> 01:14:59,214
- That's definitely not him.
- That's got to be the Iceman.

566
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,848
He's not the one I took the money from.

567
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,896
- That's got to be the Iceman.
- This is too much!

568
01:15:08,944 --> 01:15:15,528
The state may proceed with
a criminal trial against Inspector Cates.

569
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:21,906
The trial date will be set for the
earliest opening on the court calendar.

570
01:15:43,356 --> 01:15:48,018
- Iceman whacked out Price.
- You want to talk about it?

571
01:15:48,194 --> 01:15:50,317
The man had no choice.
Your girl ratted him out to the cops.

572
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:57,442
That's no bullshit. You both know her.
She lives at the King Mei Hotel.

573
01:15:57,621 --> 01:16:01,666
You should be more careful
about who you hang out with.

574
01:16:01,834 --> 01:16:06,792
- Who pulled the trigger?
- What's the fucking difference?

575
01:16:06,964 --> 01:16:11,294
The cops were getting too close.
It's business, not personal.

576
01:16:11,469 --> 01:16:14,423
You should learn the difference.

577
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:17,433
Business... Yeah.

578
01:16:22,981 --> 01:16:25,769
That's business, too.

579
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,114
You happy now, asshole?

580
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:41,072
That still doesn't change the job.

581
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:44,999
- You've got to kill Hammond.
- How do we do that?

582
01:16:45,172 --> 01:16:50,463
Kirkland Smith is the dude
who kept Reggie alive in the joint.

583
01:16:50,636 --> 01:16:53,756
Reggie owes him.
He's going to pay back.

584
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:59,222
The dude has a daughter who works
in the Haight Goodwill Store.

585
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:04,900
We're gonna get Hammond,
and the cop and the Iceman.

586
01:17:05,068 --> 01:17:10,109
- We'll kill them all.
- Just stick to Hammond, Joe Bob.

587
01:17:17,539 --> 01:17:20,493
I keep forgetting the combination.

588
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:26,130
I don't want to see you clear out
your locker. We can get this guy.

589
01:17:35,934 --> 01:17:39,054
I've been a cop for 20 years.

590
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:42,812
All I've ever been around
are pimps, murderers and robbers.

591
01:17:42,983 --> 01:17:48,938
Between you and me, I've always
been straight. You did your best...

592
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:54,910
...so here's your $475,000.

593
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:10,343
You kept my money in a police locker?

594
01:18:10,512 --> 01:18:16,017
Yeah! Hey, we've got no more ties.
You're a free man, Reg.

595
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:21,809
My advice to you is,
take this money and disappear.

596
01:18:36,832 --> 01:18:40,165
- Are you sure, man?
- Yeah.

597
01:18:44,256 --> 01:18:45,799
All right.

598
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:09,312
Thank you. Have a nice day.

599
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:21,243
Reggie Hammond. This is $75,000,
courtesy of your father.

600
01:19:21,421 --> 01:19:26,379
- This money has got to be dirty.
- We both know your father is no angel.

601
01:19:26,551 --> 01:19:30,632
This money is not stolen.
He helped me when I was in jail.

602
01:19:32,307 --> 01:19:34,514
I owed him.
He thought it would benefit you.

603
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:38,730
A lot of fathers wouldn't even do this.
Accept it. Bye-bye.

604
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:45,524
Mr. Hammond... how is he?

605
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:48,448
He's good. You should go see him.

606
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:53,778
- Maybe.
- No, you should go see him.

607
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:31,149
- Hey.
- Hi, Ben.

608
01:20:32,872 --> 01:20:39,586
- Sorry I couldn't help more.
- You did what you could.

609
01:20:39,754 --> 01:20:46,718
It's gonna be pretty fucking dull
without you around here.

610
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:52,135
- Get a beer?
- Maybe later.

611
01:21:05,865 --> 01:21:09,483
- You got a bunch of messages, Frank.
- Thanks, Joe.

612
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,664
- Yeah?
- <i>We got Hammond. </i>

613
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:27,627
- Good. Is he dead yet?
- <i>There's a change in plans. </i>

614
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:31,554
- Killing one of us wasn't in the deal.
- What is this shit?

615
01:21:31,726 --> 01:21:34,513
<i>You want him dead, we want 500 G's. </i>

616
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:38,519
For doing one of the Brotherhood.

617
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:44,398
<i>500,000 or Hammond fingers you. </i>
<i>There's a place in Modesto... </i>

618
01:21:44,573 --> 01:21:48,405
You want more money,
pick a place indoors, with lots of people.

619
01:21:55,918 --> 01:22:01,542
Some guy named Burroughs,
looks just like the guy you were after.

620
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:04,551
They found him dead in the Mission.

621
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,053
Here's his sheet. It's a mile long.

622
01:22:12,686 --> 01:22:16,185
I circulated this guy's picture here
and got nothing.

623
01:22:16,356 --> 01:22:19,642
That's funny,
Cruise busted him last July.

624
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:51,553
Cates, even though there's
no love lost between us, -

625
01:22:51,727 --> 01:22:53,270
- let's let bygones be bygones.

626
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:37,145
I'm looking for the Cage Club,
the upstairs part.

627
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:40,521
Fifth floor. You've got to join. 50 bucks.

628
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:11,185
You don't look too happy, Reg.

629
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:17,564
Sorry. I'll buy you a drink later.

630
01:24:28,246 --> 01:24:30,453
Where's Hammond?

631
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:36,289
- Who's the girl?
- Just somebody he was with.

632
01:24:38,924 --> 01:24:46,221
500 G's, right?
Now, let's check the merchandise.

633
01:24:53,106 --> 01:24:58,860
Take him out behind the building and
blow him away. Shoot both of them.

634
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:04,190
What's this guy doing here?
That guy ain't the Iceman.

635
01:25:04,368 --> 01:25:09,327
- You're just trying to save your ass.
- That guy is a cop. It's a set-up.

636
01:25:11,292 --> 01:25:14,827
They got the wrong guy,
don't they, Cruise?

637
01:25:18,842 --> 01:25:20,669
Hello, Jack.

638
01:25:20,844 --> 01:25:25,222
It's Christmas here, Willie.
We can take them all.

639
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,964
That's the Iceman!

640
01:25:28,143 --> 01:25:32,722
Pretty good, Jack.
You always were a smart cop.

641
01:25:32,898 --> 01:25:38,024
- I really didn't want to believe it.
- Sorry to let you down, Jack.

642
01:25:38,529 --> 01:25:42,314
All I want is the Iceman.
You two, take the money and leave.

643
01:25:42,492 --> 01:25:46,442
- Nobody is leaving with my money.
- Money? I want the fucking Iceman.

644
01:26:06,017 --> 01:26:08,473
Get out of the way.

645
01:27:05,956 --> 01:27:07,948
Fuck!

646
01:27:27,145 --> 01:27:32,222
- Somebody help me!
- Shut up!

647
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,310
Let go of me.

648
01:27:36,154 --> 01:27:40,900
You fucking bitch!

649
01:28:11,025 --> 01:28:17,443
You set me up, Ben.
You never ran that shit through NCIC.

650
01:28:17,615 --> 01:28:20,735
You had Cruise
pick up the gun at the track.

651
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:23,448
I needed leverage on you.
You were getting close.

652
01:29:43,498 --> 01:29:46,333
Jack, we can work this out,
just let me out of here.

653
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:55,126
You're a disgrace, Ben.
There's nothing worse than a bad cop.

654
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:58,089
Thank you for a very pleasant day!

655
01:29:58,263 --> 01:30:00,221
I've got no car, no money, -

656
01:30:00,391 --> 01:30:04,934
- and now I've got this
dope man's Uzi by my temple.

657
01:30:05,104 --> 01:30:09,647
This is Jack's day. Why don't you
let Jack shoot me? Shoot me, Jack!

658
01:30:44,354 --> 01:30:46,845
I can't believe you shot me.

659
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:51,437
I told you to buy a bullet-proof vest.

660
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:55,989
You did real good, Reggie.

661
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:02,031
The doc says you'll be fine.
I guess I'm a pretty good shot.

662
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:06,584
- You're gonna have to take it easy.
- I'm sorry he was your friend.

663
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:10,798
He wasn't my friend. You're my friend.

664
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,587
Besides, I had to save my partner.

665
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:23,138
I got this off the Iceman.

666
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:29,849
It's 500 grand. I'll meet you
at the hospital and we'll talk about it.

667
01:31:36,743 --> 01:31:39,578
Here, hold this for me.

668
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:52,927
