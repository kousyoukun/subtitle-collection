In the matter of
the officer-involved shooting

215
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,852
at Hunters Point raceway
of the suspect Arthur Brock,

216
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,770
a resident of San Francisco,

217
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,897
the review board has carefully examined

218
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,109
the physical evidence
and the testimony of the witnesses,

219
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,403
and has determined
that the officer in question,

220
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:18,325
Inspector Jack Cates,
had insufficient probable cause.

221
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,411
Based on a review of
the officer's case history

222
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,874
and an ongoing investigation
by the Internal Affairs Division,

223
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,959
this review board cannot help but rule

224
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,420
that the shooting was a wrongful action.

of stepping over the line, okay?

00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,880
put the money underneath the pillow
like the tooth fairy.

462
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:52,132
Yeah, you got framed.
That's what every convict says.

463
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,259
Hey, what about you, man?

464
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,761
You know they never found
that bad guy's gun at the racetrack.

465
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,596
- That's different.
- What's different about that?

466
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,099
- I'm a cop. You're a crook.
- Get the fuck out of here!

467
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,183
Just because I'm a convict,

468
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,935
everything that comes out
of my mouth is a goddamn lie?

469
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,603
- That's right.
- So just screw Reggie Hammond?

470
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,730
- That's right.
- Man, just take me to my goddamn car.

471
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:07,815
I'm through with you.

472
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,317
- What's wrong? Your arm hurt?
- Yeah. Thanks to your friends.

473
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,735
- Hurt bad?
- Yeah.

474
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,028
Good.

475
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,196
You hear the news?

476
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,448
Yeah, well, we got a problem here, slick.

477
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,742
Hey, man, back up.

478
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,536
I'm not the one
that hired these hillbillies,

479
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,288
so don't come complaining to me, okay?

480
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,541
Yes. Plan B.

481
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,626
We got an ex-Marine on the case.

482
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,795
Only problem is he's a hillbilly, too.

483
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,590
Yeah. Right.

484
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,842
Later.

485
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,602
How much of my money
did you spend, anyway?

486
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,479
Oh, about 25 grand.

487
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,231
You said I could buy a new car.

488
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,651
- Well, where is it?
- This is the new car.

489
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,322
This look like the same piece-of-shit,
sky-blue Cadillac you had before.

490
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,824
Yeah, I bought the same model,
year, color, everything the same.

491
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,410
That's the way I like it.
I get attached to things, Reggie.

492
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,580
- You got the same car. Same clothes.
- Yeah.

493
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,206
You got the same girl, too?

494
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:07,875
Elaine?

495
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,169
Ah, hell, I don't want to talk
about this shit.

496
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,421
Well, this is good.
Keep it all balled up like a nut.

497
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,966
[Jack]
She married me about five years ago.

498
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,135
Drove me over to city hall
for a quick ceremony.

499
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,179
She figured she'd settle me down.

500
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,600
This is where we lived until we split up.

501
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,770
She moved up to Mill Valley.
I've been trying to sell it.

502
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,481
Twelve grand of yours
went for the down payment.

503
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,067
Man, how could you leave my car
outside all these years?

504
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,526
Why didn't you put it
in the fucking garage?

505
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,779
Look at that dirt all over it.
What if somebody stole it?

506
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,364
Yeah, I had an alarm put on it.

507
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,949
Here, you just push
this blue button right there.

508
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,285
You have no appreciation
whatsoever for what's hype.

509
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,788
That's what it is.
You don't know that that car is fly.

510
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,873
You know how much pussy I got
because of that car?

511
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,166
[alarm chirps]

512
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,762
They blew up my car! They blew up my car!

513
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,680
They blew up my car!

514
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,349
It's a damn shame.

515
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:09,395
They blew up my goddamn car, and all you
got to say is, "It's a damn shame"?

516
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,272
No car. No money. You're having a bad day.

517
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,358
That's it. I'm through with you, man!

518
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,984
I'm calling some of my fucking homeys.

519
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,320
I'm getting a loan
and I'm stepping the fuck off!

520
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,114
[debris clattering]

521
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:30,833
Buster! Hey, what's up, man?
How you doing? Reggie Hammond.

522
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,209
Yes, my brother!

523
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,962
Yeah, I'm out, my man.
I'm on the street again.

524
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,257
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.
Just cool it, brother. Yo, listen.

525
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,342
No, no, no, listen.
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna do that.

526
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,636
I know. I'm gonna take care...
That's what I'm calling about.

527
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,054
I need a loan.

528
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:47,266
Uh-huh. Yeah, I know... I know
I owe you some shit, but I need a loan.

529
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,477
Now, I just got out of jail. Brother,
my brother, everything's gonna be...

530
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:51,562
Yes, listen.

531
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:55,023
No, I don't have no collateral.
I just got out of jail, man.

532
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,734
The fuck I need collateral for?
This is Reggie Hammond.

533
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,361
Hey. Hey.

534
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,947
Hey, Buster? Buster?

535
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,211
[Ben] Jack, what the hell's going on?

536
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,046
We got a report you were shot
and your house blew up.

537
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,673
No, not my house. A car.

538
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,675
The fire department's still out there.
Your car blew up?

539
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:22,801
No, no, it wasn't my car.

540
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,636
It was some other guy's car
parked in front.

541
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,639
Listen, anything come in on those bikers
that hit the prison bus?

542
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,349
- No, not yet. I'll check again.
- All right.

543
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:31,768
Look, Jack, do me a favor
and go see Wilson.

544
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,270
He told me
if you won't see him right away,

545
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,771
he's gonna send somebody out to get you.

546
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:35,856
Shit.

547
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,319
Hey, Jack. You okay?

548
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,655
[siren wailing]

549
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,746
[police radio chatter]

550
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,293
Hey, you giving that guy a ticket?

551
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,128
Good. He hates cops.

552
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,546
He does, huh?

553
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,590
Yeah, I rode down here with him.

554
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,258
He told me that cops ain't shit

555
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,844
and that y'all was just pussies
that hide behind your badges.

556
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,763
And he also said
that he gonna park this car,

557
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,057
he don't care if it's a no-parking zone,

558
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,893
and if I see a cop,
tell the cop to kiss his ass.

559
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,102
So kiss his ass.

560
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,814
Your friend's not too smart.

561
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,486
Yeah, I know. He's a big dumb-ass cop
named Jack Cates.

562
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,946
Shit.

563
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,157
Tell Cates to stop parking
in front of the station.

564
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,123
[knocks]

565
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,583
[Wilson] Hello, Jack.

566
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,003
First, the motorcycle track
and then the diner,

567
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,297
and now we found a bomb at your house?

568
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,841
And I'll bet the Ice Man's responsible
for it all, right?

569
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,511
I'm not gonna stand here
and argue with you.

570
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,471
Man to man, I'm here to support you.

571
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,141
However, as Supervisor
of Internal Affairs,

572
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,520
it's my job to tell you
that you're still on suspension,

573
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,273
at least until the court hearing tomorrow.

574
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:04,111
So, why don't you give me that gun
and your badge and police ID?

575
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,612
Yeah. Right.

576
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,616
[Wilson] I'll bet you think
I enjoy this, don't you?

577
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,247
Jack, do me a favor.

578
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,790
Go home and get some sleep.

579
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,087
I got to go down
and check on a few things.

580
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,505
Make out some reports.

581
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:29,553
You know, I don't mind
people checking up on cops.

582
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,096
I don't think we're above the law.

583
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,182
But making cops do it,
it's bad for morale.

584
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,350
It's bad for cops.

585
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,020
Civilians ought to do it.

586
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,898
You're a real chickenshit, Wilson.

587
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,071
But maybe it's not your fault.
Maybe it's your job.

Get the fuck out of here.

when you beat the bitch up, now.

No, no, don't get me wrong.
I know you can find Jesus.

Everybody can find Jesus.
No, I love Jesus.

biker types in the last four days.

Two traffics and a D&D up in North Beach.

610
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,364
Run these guys through the NCIC.

00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,782
I'll have Cruise do it.

612

Don't look much like a biker to me.

No, I don't think so.

Now, let's... We're just gonna go
and talk to this girl. Right?

922
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,397
- Don't snake me, Jack.
- I'm not gonna snake you.

923
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,733
If she's here,
we're just gonna talk to her. All right?

924
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:28,154
I mean, this is just
straight-ahead cop stuff, isn't it?

925
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,656
Here.

926
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,784
Thank you.

927
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,122
Give me that.

928
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:09,362
So, when's Cherry coming over?

929
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,325
Don't worry. He'll be by.

930
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:21,123
He said you were real nice.

931
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:23,959
He was right.

932
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:32,885
[speaking Mandarin]

933
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,680
- We never hear of her.
- Heard of her now?

[scoffs, speaks Mandarin]

That fake badge. My kid get one of those.

936
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,603
Your kid got one of these?

[speaking Mandarin]

938
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,695
Angel Lee, upstairs. Fourth floor, 4B.

939
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:52,613
Okay.

940
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,702
Chances are she hasn't even seen this guy.

941
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:58,911
I mean, he's in town for a hit.

942
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,205
He's not gonna stop off
and pop his old girlfriend.

943
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,249
Yes, he will, man,
and then share with his friends.

944
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,459
- They're like Eskimos.
- All right, you wait down here.

945
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:06,627
I'm going up and see the lady.

946
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:08,754
No. Wrong. I ain't waiting down here.
I ain't got no gun.

947
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,798
What am I gonna do
if these bikers show up? Make a mean face?

948
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,633
You got a pistol.
You stay here and watch this shit,

949
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,260
and if she's up there, I'll shout down.

950
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,303
All right, all right.
Here, you want this badge?

951
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,640
No. I don't think I'm gonna run
into no little kids on the way up.

Yeah? Who is it?

955
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,837
[Reggie] I have a pizza delivery
for Miss Angel.

956
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,630
I didn't order any pizza.

957
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,510
Uh, it says, um, uh, room 4B,
Miss Angel, pizza delivery.

958
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:23,639
Hang on a second.
I got to get something on.

959
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,309

No fucking way!

01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:15,149
You can't be alive! I already killed you!

You killed my family, pig!

I'm gonna kill you!

Yeah, we got the perimeter secured.
Jack's okay.

991
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:07,654
I haven't had a chance
to get a statement from him yet, though.

992
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,698
I don't know whose gun he used.

993
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,367
Look, I'll get a statement from him...

994
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:14,286
I'll get the statement, okay? Fine.

995
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,999
You know, you're in deep shit.
You know that, Jack?

996
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,085
Tell me something I don't know.

997
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:24,546
I ran this guy through NCIC.
I couldn't come up with a match on him.

998
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,757
[sighs] That figures.

999
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:41,480
Okay. Right now you're looking at
accessory to murder one.

1000
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,108
That gets you five to ten years inside,

1001
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,445
and that's with good behavior,
unless you cooperate with us,

1002
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:49,988
and then you might not do any time at all.

1003
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:51,532
Look, I told the other cop.

1004
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,826
I got nothing to say
until I talk to a lawyer.

1005
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:57,037
Are you protecting this guy Cherry
because you're in love with him?

1006
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,205
I can certainly understand

1007
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,082
why a girl could fall in love
with a guy like that.

1008
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,459
What's he do?
Blow through town once or twice a year,

1009
01:06:02,543 --> 01:06:04,378
let his friends jump up and down on you,

1010
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:07,339
get drunk and beat
the shit out of you, huh?

1011
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,424
I can understand
why a girl would love a guy like that.

1012
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,885
- I totally understand that.
- Look, I don't know where they're at.

1013
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,137
They move around all the time.

1014
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,556
- I can never get in touch with him.
- Well, who can?

1015
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,017
I don't know. Those guys are nuts.

1016
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:21,603
[Reggie] Don't worry about anything.
This is officer Jack Cates.

1017
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:23,063
Mr. Cates,

1018
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:25,899
Miss Lee here was about
to help us out with the investigation.

1019
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:29,820
I think she was about to tell me
the name of Mr. Cherry's contact man.

1020
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,075
The guy's name is Malcolm Price.

1021
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:39,746
He's big, spooky eyes, long hair.

1022
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,708
Nobody talks to Cherry
unless they talk to him first.

1023
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:47,838
- Okay. Now, where do we find this guy?
- I don't know.

1024
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,006
Hey.

1025
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:52,259
I swear. I only know a name.

1026
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,137
Thanks, babe.

1027
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:57,848
Hey, wait a minute!

1028
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,897
Hey, Jack. Hey, Jack.

1029
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,440
Where in the hell
do you think you're going?

1030
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,608
Radio back to Kehoe,

1031
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:11,361
and tell him to run up a shit sheet
on a biker named Malcolm Price.

1032
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,655
Good bet he's got a long record.
We're out of here.

1033
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:15,073
[Cruise] I got to get a statement.

1034
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:18,243
Hey, man, your ass is gonna be grass.
I'm telling you now.

1035
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:24,791
At the rate we going, you'll probably
pick up Price at my funeral.

1036
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,501
Oh, don't worry about your funeral.

1037
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:29,171
If the Ice Man gets you,
we won't even find your body.

1038
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,339
You know what it is, man?

1039
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,925
We need to go somewhere and talk to
somebody who knows about stuff like this.

1040
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:34,843
- Okay, where?
- Honestly?

1041
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:37,179
- We should go back to prison.
- Oh, bullshit.

1042
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,597
Hey, man, you got any better ideas

1043
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,265
on how to find out something
about Malcolm Price?

1044
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:42,601
I got a guy on the inside
who knows everything about everybody.

1045
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:43,936
He can finger anybody, man.

1046
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:46,313
Plus, it wouldn't be a bad idea for you
to go to prison, anyway,

1047
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,148
'cause you might be spending
some time there real soon,

1048
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:50,317
and I think it'd be a good job
for you to go get reacquainted

1049
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,277
with some of the brothers
whose rights you violated.

1050
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,238
Oh, don't give me that!
I just arrest crooks.

1051
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,489
I don't make 'em steal.

1052
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,491
Jack, you don't get it, do you?
You make it sound like

1053
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,034
everybody went down
to a guidance counselor,

1054
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,494
took a test, and the results came back,

1055
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,329
crook was the only job
they was qualified for.

1056

Oh, that's a real good story, Reggie.

1057
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:07,626
Blame it on society.
Put it on society's shoulders.

1058
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:08,961
Let me tell you something, Jack.

1059

If shit was worth something,
poor people'd be born with no assholes.

01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,391
I heard about it.

1063
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:26,186
Well, hey, man, I warned you about
dealing with these crazy-ass crackers.

1064
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,231
What? No, I ain't carrying.

1065
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,941
That ain't my thing. You know that.

1066
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,694
Look, I'm a businessman, too,

1067
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,862
but I just don't want to get too close
to these guys.

You know, man, these cats are taking
all of the fun out of my work.

01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:41,618
Right.

1070
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,621
Yeah, I remember. I remember.

1071
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:49,042
I said you don't have to remind me
of it, okay?

1072
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:52,504
Don't worry about it.
I'll pull it together.

01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:13,567
Good morning, Kirkland.
You got some visitors.

1076
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:25,037
[man] Hey, man,
will you shut up over there!

1077
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,271
All right. Hold on.
Get that picture of the guy.

1078
01:09:57,444 --> 01:10:01,239
He's a small-time dealer.
His name is, uh, Burroughs.

1079
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,992
Recruited by the Ice Man,
I don't know, a couple of months ago.

1080
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:06,328
Okay, I wanna know, like,
do you know anything about the guy

1081
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,206
he's supposed to work for?
This main dude named Malcolm Price?

1082
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:12,501
Yeah, I know him. Western Brotherhood.

1083
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:16,213
You want these guys to do a hit for you,
you got to go through Price.

1084
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,133
- You got an address?
- I'm not 411. You look it up.

1085
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,844
Sunset Motel on the beltway.

1086
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,056
And give the phone back to Reggie.

1087
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,518
- What's his problem?
- I don't know.

1088
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,146
Say, man, do you mind?
I'm trying to talk to the brother here.

1089
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,399
Oh, uh, I'll handle this.

1090
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:38,193
Can you excuse me? Me and my brother
want to talk, you know.

1091
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,820
It's Black stuff. Excuse us.

1092
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:43,365
- It's private.
- You mind? You mind?

1093
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,325
Yeah. Hang on.

1094
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:48,286
Just... Look, can you go over there,
please? Thank you.

1095
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:50,664
- It's private.
- All right, all right.

1096
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:53,834
Reggie, look.

1097
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:57,003
Now that I've given you something you need

1098
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,588
for the second time...

1099
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:02,843
Yes, you have, and I appreciate
your patience, and thank you.

1100
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:04,928
You will

1101
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,389
repay your debt to me!

1102
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,522
[knocks]

1103
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:25,866
Hey, man, not to worry.

1104
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,576
We got lots of backup.

1105
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,662
Come on in and have a drink.

1106
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:39,880
- [silenced gunfire]
- [groaning]

1107
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:53,768
Malcolm Price.

1108
01:11:56,062 --> 01:12:00,192
Must have been a real good lead, Jack.
Somebody shot him 16 times.

1109
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,570
I've been chasing
this goddamn Ice Man for years.

1110
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:06,907
Every time I get close,
it's another goddamn dead end.

1111
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:11,870
- This job will drive you crazy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1112
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:15,332
Jack, the Ice Man's a cop.

1113
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,501
No way.

1114
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,711
Hey, come on, Jack.
Put this shit together, man.

1115
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,173
Jack, think about it.

1116
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:26,343
You called for Price's address.
The Ice Man shows up there first.

1117
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:28,553
It's a coincidence. Bad luck.

1118
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:30,597
That ain't no damn coincidence.
What about the brother

1119
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,098
whose picture you've been showing around?

1120
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:33,433
You get any feedback on that yet?

1121
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:36,228
Well, that don't mean nothing.
You gotta run a mug shot through NCIC.

1122
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:37,979
It takes time to get a make.

1123
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:39,606
- How long that take?
- Hours.

1124
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,651
- It's been hours.
- Well, sometimes it's slow.

1125
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,402
Come on, man. That's a lame excuse, Jack.

1126
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:46,279
Let me tell you
why the Ice Man wants to kill me.

1127
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:48,198
Has nothing to do
with the money that I took, okay?

1128
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,282
That's fly shit to him.

1129
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,201
He want to kill me
because I seen him, Jack.

1130
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,994
I can identify him.
I'm back on the street.

1131
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:54,246
He thinks I can blow his cover.

1132
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:57,082
The same guy that's trying to kill me
is fucking up your investigation.

1133
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,417
Find out which guy is putting up
the most resistance

1134
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,045
'cause you're on this case.
That is probably the Ice Man.

1135
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,507
Only guy it could be is Wilson...

1136
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,885
and that prick's been dogging my ass
for years,

1137
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:10,845
ever since I started looking
for the Ice Man.

1138
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,097
All through this thing.

1139
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,807
Listen, I got to get you over
to the hearing

1140
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,976
- so you can ID this guy. Come on.
- What hearing?

1141
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:17,435
The one where they're going to decide

1142
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,813
whether they're gonna put me in jail
and take away my badge for good.

1143
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,273
It started two hours ago.

1144
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:24,609
[Wilson] After the incident
in the Mission District,

1145
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:26,695
Inspector Cates dredged up this theory

1146
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:30,407
of a criminal mastermind
running the drug traffic in the Bay Area.

1147
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,866
For four years, in my opinion,

1148
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,953
he has wasted department resources
and manpower,

1149
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:38,415
risked other officers' lives
to vindicate himself and his theories.

1150
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:42,168
Can you describe
Inspector Cates's professional attitude?

1151
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,714
When a police officer
takes it upon himself

1152
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:49,009
to violate department regulations
and suspects' civil rights,

1153
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:52,554
it makes it hard on every good cop
who's out there trying to do his job.

1154
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,180
Objection, Your Honor,

1155
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:57,434
these remarks have nothing to do
with the incident at hand.

1156
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,019
On the contrary, Your Honor.

1157
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:02,480
I'm trying to show a pattern of behavior
on Inspector Cates's part

1158
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:05,317
that will illuminate
the events at Hunters Point Raceway.

1159
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,194
I'll, uh, let the testimony stand.

1160
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:31,259
[judge] In consideration
of the preliminary evidence

1161
01:14:31,343 --> 01:14:33,261
presented thus far by the State

1162
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:36,139
and in adherence to the laws,
statutes, and rules

1163
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,016
as specified by the State of California,

1164
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,684
city of San Francisco...

1165
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:41,394
There he is right there!

1166
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:44,230
[judge] Order! Order!
Please, let's have some order here.

1167
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:46,232
This is an official hearing.

1168
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:48,943
- No, it's some other guy.
- No, no, no! Right there!

1169
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:51,112
I'm looking at him, Jack.
It's somebody else. That's not him.

1170
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:53,490
- No, God damn it, that's gotta be him.
- Who are these men?

1171
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,492
That, Your Honor, is Inspector Jack Cates.

1172
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,910
That's definitely not the guy.

1173
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,287
No, that's got to be
the goddamn Ice Man. People change.

1174
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:00,789
Hey, man, you don't
forget somebody you took

1175
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:02,290
half a million dollars from.
That's not him.

1176
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:05,293
Well, God damn it, it's gotta be him!
That's gotta be the Ice Man!

1177
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,045
- [judge] This is too much!
- [gavel raps]

1178
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,299
This court rules
that there is sufficient evidence

1179
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:13,176
to proceed with a criminal trial

1180
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,969
against Inspector Jack Cates.

1181
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:19,474
Trial date will be set for the
earliest opening on the court calendar.

1182
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,060
- This hearing is adjourned.
- [gavel raps]

1183
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,458
Ice Man whacked out Price.

1184
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,169
You want to talk about it?

1185
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:51,464
The man had no choice.
Your girl ratted him out to the cops.

1186
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:54,884
- [Cherry] Bullshit.
- I don't bullshit. You both know her.

1187
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:57,679
She works as a dancer,
lives at the King Mei Hotel.

1188
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,014
You know, you two should be
a little bit more careful

1189
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:01,808
about who you hang out with.

1190
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,393
Who pulled the trigger?

1191
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:06,896
What's the fucking difference
who pulled the trigger?

1192
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,983
The cops were getting too close.
That's the way the Man does business.

1193
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,526
Business, not personal.

1194
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,571
You know, you two fucking hillbillies
should learn the difference.

1195
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,906
Business. Yeah.

1196
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,079
[Burroughs] Ah! What?

1197
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:24,205
That's business, too.

1198
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:27,000
[groans]

1199
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,378
[laughing]

1200
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,259
You happy now, asshole?

1201
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:40,013
That still doesn't change the job.

1202
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:45,143
- You got to kill Reggie Hammond.
- And how are we gonna do that?

1203
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:49,022
Kirkland Smith, he's the dude
who kept Reggie alive in the joint

1204
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,774
when we had papers out on him.

1205
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,985
Reggie owes him.
I figured out where he's gonna pay back.

1206
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,529
The dude's got a daughter
works in the Goodwill store

1207
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,198
in the Haight just off Central.

1208
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:01,409
Well, you know what we're gonna do?
We're going to get Hammond,

1209
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:04,454
and we're going to get the cop,
and the Ice Man,

1210
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,498
and we're going to kill them all.

1211
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:10,251
You just stick to Hammond, Joe Bob.
That's the gig.

1212
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,511
I keep forgetting the combination.

1213
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:24,057
Hey, Jack, I don't want to see
you clear out your locker, man.

1214
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,267
Let's get back out on the streets.
We can get this guy.

1215
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:39,197
You know, Reggie,
I've been a cop for 20 years,

1216
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,951
and all I've ever been around is pimps,
murderers, and robbers,

1217
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:46,454
but between you and me,
I've always been straight.

1218
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:49,082
Now, you did your best.

1219
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:54,462
So, here's your 475 thou.

1220
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:08,810
- You kept my money in your locker?
- Yeah.

1221
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,478
In a police locker, Jack?

1222
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:13,898
Yeah. Hey, we got no more ties.

1223
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,234
You're a free man, Reg.

This is $75,000, courtesy of your father.

1233
01:19:21,466 --> 01:19:24,052
This money comes from Kirkland Smith?
It's got to be dirty.

Hey, wait a second, now.

1235
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:28,514
We both know your father's no angel,
but this money is not stolen.

1236
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:30,683
Your father did a favor for me.
I just got out of jail.

Had some money before I went in.

1238
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,646
I owed some money to your father,
and he thought it would benefit you.

1239
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:37,231
A lot of fathers wouldn't even do this.
I think you should accept it.
