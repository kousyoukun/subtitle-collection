321

for the last four years.

322
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:14,009
Now, last week, I find out
this Ice Man wants you dead.

Here, take a look
at this.

324
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:18,514
I got this off of some guy
paying someone to make a hit on you.

You recognize
this guy? Huh?

326
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:25,020
Now, in four years, Reggie,
that makes you the best lead I ever had.

327
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,023
Yeah?
Well, helping you out while you got my money

328
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:29,709
is something
I don't want to do!

in a fucking prison for five years

330
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:33,696
and you show up
wanting some help. That's bullshit.

That's worse
than bullshit.

That's dumb, man!

Reggie,
this time, I promise you it's gonna be different.

334
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,505
Now, look,
I'm gonna lose my badge.

335
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,341
They're gonna
put me in jail.

about you keeping my money,

that shit almost
makes me feel better.

340
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,599
Now I'm sure I don't want
to go with you!

whip my ass?

You gonna shoot me out here
in front of the prison?

00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:23,254
You go do your
cop shit, Jack.

787
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:24,255
I'm gonna
check out these hoes.

788
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:25,757
All right.

789
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:40,438
Hey!

790
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,740
You're the one that called in
the complaint on some bikers?

791
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,159
Oh, well,
call the 6:00 news.

792
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,660
Cops finally responded.

793
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,944
Only been a day
and a half, you know.

794
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:48,196
Are you gonna tell
me what happened,

795
00:45:48,196 --> 00:45:49,280
or you gonna bitch
a little more?

796
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,281
I'm gonna bitch
a little more.

797
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:53,201
You guys are never here
when somebody needs you.

798
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:54,202
Can I have
a shot of Stoli?

799
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:56,704
On the rocks?
Yeah. Great.

800
00:45:56,704 --> 00:45:58,205
Hey, how you doing?

801
00:45:58,206 --> 00:45:59,707
Hi. Buy me a drink?

802
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:01,208
Oh, baby,
I just got out of jail.

803
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:03,211
I'm dead cracked,
but you can buy my drink.

804
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:04,345
Fuck off.

805
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,020
Hi.

806
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,471
I know you, right?

807
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,472
Yeah, you do.

808
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:15,974
You broke my heart once.

809
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,441
(CHUCKLES) Did I?

810
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:18,776
I'm not letting you
get away this time.

811
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,695
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back. Well, take mine.

812
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,447
I just have to
powder my nose.

813
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,949
Just powder my nose.
I'll be right back.

814

(CHUCKLING)

815
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,579
Hey.

816
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,914
Hey, how you doing?

817
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:41,415
I'm pretty good.
How are you?

818
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:43,717
I'm all right.
Yeah.

819
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,586
Hey, you ever see
those commercials on TV

820
00:46:45,587 --> 00:46:46,804
with the tourists?

821
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,923
With the guy
with the big nose?

822
00:46:48,923 --> 00:46:50,224
Karl Malden.
The big-ass nose man.

823
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,676
Did you ever see
those commercials where he shows the people

824
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:55,012
getting their pockets
picked in slow-motion?

825
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:00,601
Yeah.
Shit!

826
00:47:00,602 --> 00:47:03,104
Yeah. Shit is a good word
to say there. Right.

827
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:04,688
But, listen, I can get
your money back for you,

828
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:05,773
but it's gonna cost you.

829
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:06,690
How much?

830
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:09,244
I think half your money
would be good.

831
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,328
Half? Give me a break!

832
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,195
I'm giving you
a break, man.

833
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,697
You ain't got
nothing now.

834
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,198
The bitch is in the back,
counting your money.

835
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,700
Listen, she's gonna get
your credit cards,

836
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,202
run your rate up,
and your credit's gonna be all fucked up.

837
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,871
Look, you don't want
to do it, fuck you.

838
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,789
You got a deal.
I figured I had a deal.

839
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:24,291
So the guy with the dark hair
starts asking about this girl

840
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:25,793
who used to work here,

841
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:28,128
then he gets rough,
starts grabbing me and stuff.

842
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,131
And the blond one
pulls out a gun.

843
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:32,133
Cute, huh?
What about this girl?

844
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,718
Angel?
She stopped working here over a year ago.

845
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,721
She's dancing
at the Bird Cage up in North Beach.

846
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,107
Hey, aren't you
supposed to be writing all this down?

847
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,608
I got a photographic memory.

848
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,359
Now, you got an address,
or where she lives?

849
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,461
This is
the ladies' room.

850
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,962
You're not
supposed to be in here.

851
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,965
Well, y'all are leaving,
so mind your business.

852
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,502
Hey.

853
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:09,504
I thought this would
be a good time

854
00:48:10,004 --> 00:48:11,505
for us to get to
know each other.

855
00:48:11,506 --> 00:48:14,008
You're very smooth.
Very, very smooth.

856
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:15,509
I've seen a lot of
pockets get picked,

857
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,011
but I ain't never seen
nobody as smooth as you.

858
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:19,013
I was just talking to
the guy that you hit,

859
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:20,515
and he's so upset.

860
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:22,016
I told him that
I'd come in here,

861
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:24,518
and I'd get
half his money back for him.

862
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:28,022
That is, unless, of course,
you offer me a nice little bribe,

863
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:29,023
then I'll go out there
and I'll tell him

864
00:48:29,524 --> 00:48:30,741
that you was
a bit too fast for me.

865
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,744
I am too fast for you.

866
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:42,036
Hi. Almost finished.

867
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,260
Was anybody else with them?

868
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,095
No, they came in,
just the three of them.

869
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,931
There was this black guy.
Yeah, skinny.

870
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,883
Yeah, the oldest one
was talking to a black guy.

871
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:58,185
A black guy, huh? Here.

872
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,721
Was it something like this?

873
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:02,473
Yeah. Yeah. That's him.

874
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,475
He was okay.
He didn't bother me.

875
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:07,478
Now, look,
if they come in again,

876
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,480
I want you to call down
to the department.

877
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,482
You ask for
Inspector Ben Kehoe.

878
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,534
He'll know what to do.

879
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,035
You're in luck.
Here's half your money.

880
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,538
Great. What about
my credit cards?

881
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,706
We had no credit card deal.
I said your money.

WILSON: After the incident
in the Mission District,

1328
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,569
Inspector Cates
dredged up this theory

of a criminal mastermind
running the drug traffic in the Bay Area.

1330
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,574
For four years,
in my opinion,

1331
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,577
he has wasted
department resources and manpower,

1332
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:38,998
risked other officers' lives
to vindicate himself and his theories.

Inspector Cates' professional attitude?

takes it upon himself

to violate

thank you for a very pleasant day.

1565
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:00,228
Okay?
I got no car, I got no money,

1568
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:05,934
Thank you, Jack.
Look, this is Jack's day.

1569
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:08,019
Why don't you just
let Jack shoot me? Save your bullet.

1570
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,104
Jack, why don't you
shoot me?

1571

you should have bought a damn bulletproof vest.
