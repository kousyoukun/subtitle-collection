YOU WANT TO HAVE YOURSELF A BEER OR SOMETHING

00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,959

* BUT THEY ONLY COST A DIME **

28
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:17,215
先付一半，完事后再付另一半
50 NOW, 50 MORE WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

29
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:22,091
- 几个人 - 就一个

30
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:28,055
- 又一个警察？ - 不是，他是你的一个朋友
HOW MANY?

31
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,657
JUST ONE.

32
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,992
WHAT IS HE, ANOTHER COP?

33
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,796
NO. MATTER OF FACT, HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS.

34
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,017
你会喜欢这活儿的
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS JOB.

35
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:40,071
他以前是我哥的手下 他先把一包毒品放在我哥那儿
HE WAS IN MY BROTHER'S GANG.

36
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,475
FIRST HE DROPPED A DIME ON HIM...

37
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,321
然后他暗地里向射杀我哥的警察告密
THEN HE RATTED HIM TO THE COP THAT BLEW HIM AWAY.

38
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,694
HEY.

39
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:04,089
- 我要进去，你要可乐吗？ - 是的，减肥可乐

40
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,398
I'LL TAKE A LOOK. WANT A COKE?

00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,733
YEAH, DIET.

42
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:20,445
我们在14号公路附近的西蒙路
WE'RE ON THE SIMMONS ROAD

43
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,915
ABOUT 15 MILES WEST OFF OF ROUTE 14.

44
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:24,400

00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:35,894
- 你给谁打电话呢，朋友？ - 我没给谁打
WHO YOU CALLING, FRIEND?

58
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,558
NO ONE. I WASN'T CALLING NOBODY.

59
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:41,605
- 不知道为什么我不相信你 - 哦，上帝啊，不要！
SOMEHOW, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

60
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,097
OH, GOD! OH, NO!

61
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:17,103
十万元，先付五万，冰人真是非常慷慨的人
$100,000.

62
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:18,799
50,000 NOW. ICEMAN'S A GENEROUS GUY.

63
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:24,438
我不喜欢面值一百的票子，这算什么？
I DON'T LIKE 100s. I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE.

64
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:33,456
就这家伙，当他被污染的时候就没了平衡 我们要他死
THIS IS THE GUY.

65
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,346
THE BALANCE IS DUE WHEN HE'S DUSTED, UNDERSTAND?

66
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:36,541
可以，随便，没问题
WE WANT HIM DEAD.

67
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,884
YEAH, WHATEVER. NO PROBLEM.

68
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:47,711
警察！不许动！
POLICE! FREEZE!

69
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:54,309
分开站立，我不希望任何人受伤，慢慢动
YOU, MOVE A STEP APART.

70
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,367
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY GETTING HURT,

71
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,936
SO MOVE SLOW.

72
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:28,216
可恶！
SHIT!

73
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,309
有警察来了，快他妈的离开这儿！

74
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,812
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

75
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:15,882
- 你差点把他烤熟 - 我只是向他开枪，没有烤他！
CHRIST, YOU REALLY TOASTED THAT GUY.

76
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,481
I DIDN'T TOAST THE GUY.

77
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,484
I JUST SHOT HIM, FOR CHRIST SAKE.

78
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:20,437
冷静，我们会找到枪，我们要齐心协力
CALM DOWN. WE'LL FIND THE GUN.

79
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:24,520
我查过这家伙的储物柜，他在赛车场工作
WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS TOGETHER.

80
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,490
I CHECKED THE GUY'S LOCKER.

81
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:29,355
他钱包里有50块，太阳镜和一些钥匙
SEEMS OK. WORKS HERE AT THE TRACK.

82
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,495
50 BUCKS IN HIS WALLET, SUNGLASSES, KEYS,

83
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:32,567
- 我们仍然没有找到他的枪 - 靠！
PROBABLY CAR OR APARTMENT.

84
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,499
WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND HIS GUN YET.

85
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:37,405
凯茨击毙了一个赛车场工人 其中一枪打到了油泵
AW, SHIT.

86
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,704
CATES TOOK DOWN ONE OF THE LOCALS.

87
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:41,828
他把那坏家伙烧焦了 杰克宣称他是合法开枪
A SLUG HIT A GAS PUMP

88
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,508
AND BURNED THE BAD GUY TO A CRISP.

89
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,712
JACK CLAIMS IT WAS A RIGHTEOUS SHOOT.

90
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,544
我讨厌这些内务部的人渣
MAN, I HATE THESE I.A.D. SCUMBAGS.

91
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,642
布雷克・威尔逊，内务部 我经常碰到你，杰克
BLAKE WILSON, INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

92
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:03,517
给我们一分钟，小伙子们
SEEMS LIKE I'M ALWAYS RUNNING INTO YOU, JACK.

93
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,364
GIVE US A MINUTE, FELLAS.

94
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:08,893
- 你这次做了什么？ - 我一直在监视
WHAT DID YOU DO NOW, JACK?

95
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:14,196
- 我几乎捉到… - 几乎？那个冰人，对吗？
I WAS ON A STAKEOUT, GETTING REAL CLOSE--

96
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,842
CLOSE? OH, HO, THE ICEMAN, RIGHT?

97
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:16,526
我就差一点，我会捉到这些家伙的
YEAH, THE ICEMAN. I'M GOING TO NAIL THESE GUYS.

98
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:20,535
每一件你解决不了的案子就算在冰人头上

99
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,849
YOU PIN EVERY CASE YOU CAN'T SOLVE ON THE ICEMAN.

100
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:25,250
海湾区最大的贩子，没有指纹 没有外貌描述
THE BAY AREA'S BIGGEST DRUG DEALER, RIGHT?

101
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,789
你是唯一相信他的存在的警察
EXCEPT WE DON'T HAVE ANY PRINTS OR A DESCRIPTION.

102
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,257
YOU'RE THE ONLY COP WHO BELIEVES THIS GUY EXISTS.

103
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:32,915
我告诉你一个秘密，不存在什么冰人
I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET--

104
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:37,970
让我们回到冰冷的现实 这儿到底出了什么事？
THERE IS NO ICEMAN.

105
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,264
SO LET'S GET BACK TO THE COLD FACTS HERE,

106
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:44,061
我看到一桩交易，我行动了，他有枪 他开枪，我还击
BECAUSE THIS IS REAL. WHAT HAPPENED?

107
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,069
I SAW AN EXCHANGE. PROBABLE CAUSE.

108
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,672
HE HAD A PIECE. HE SHOT. I SHOT BACK.

109
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:49,854
- 你拿到了那坏家伙的枪？ - 它肯定在灰烬里
YOU GOT THE BAD GUY'S GUN?

110
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:51,411
IT'S GOT TO BE IN THERE WITH THE ASHES AND SHIT.

111
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,987
- 克鲁斯，你找到什么了？ - 一些烧化的金属，油泵上的
CRUISE, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

112
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,653
NOTHING MUCH. JUST SOME BURNT METAL.

113
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:04,035
- 没有枪？ - 没有，没有枪
MUST BE OFF THE PUMP.

114
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,357
NO GUN?

115
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,125
警察也是人，人有时候会犯错的
NO, NO GUN.

116
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,995
LOOK, A COP IS A GUY,

117
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12,749
你可能有点太激进了？
AND A GUY SOMETIMES STEPS ON HIS DICK.

118
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,100
YOU THINK YOU WERE PUSHING TOO HARD

119
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:16,010
你自己犯过错误没？
TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK?

120
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,437
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE. DID YOU STEP ON--

121
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,129
他有枪，他开枪了，我还击
DAMN IT, HE HAD A PIECE! HE SHOT. I SHOT BACK.

122
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:28,274
让检查人员好好搜搜 如果有那么一把枪，我要找到它
HAVE THE LAB BOYS GO OVER EVERY INCH.

123
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,747
IF THERE'S A GUN HERE, I WANT IT.

124
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,349
A BULLET. SOMETHING. ANYTHING.

125
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:34,318
- 回见，杰克 - 好的
SEE YOU AROUND, JACK?

126
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,955
YEAH.

127
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,729
雷吉・哈蒙德
REGGIE HAMMOND.

128
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:34,542
你肯定是一个非常危险的犯人
YOU MUST BE A REAL DANGEROUS CONVICT.

129
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:43,387
- 你让我投偏了，警察 - 你看起来很好，雷吉
YOU MADE ME MISS, COP.

130
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,324
YOU LOOK GOOD, REGGIE.

131
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,061
好几年没见了，以前我们是朋友
I AIN'T SEEN YOU IN YEARS.

132
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:53,145
- 对不起，我以前很忙 - 我也是
THOUGHT YOU WAS MY FRIEND.

133
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,366
I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN BUSY.

134
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:57,355
你来这儿做甚？你甚至换了新发型
YEAH, ME, TOO.

135
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,804
YOU MUST BE DESPERATE TO COME DOWN HERE.

136
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:59,358
时代变了
WHAT'S GOING ON?

137
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,657
- 你瘦了几磅 - 我戒酒了
WELL, TIMES CHANGE.

138
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,044
WELL, YOU LOST A COUPLE OF POUNDS.

139
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:09,156
你是不是来告诉我我的刑期增加了？
QUIT DRINKING.

140
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,914
DID THE WARDEN PICK YOU

141
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,316
TO TELL ME MY SENTENCE GOT YANKED UP

142
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:14,673
不，你仍然会明天出狱 我们有点小活儿去做
ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OR SOMETHING?

143
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,120
RELAX. YOU'RE STILL GETTING OUT TOMORROW.

144
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,123
WHEN YOU DO, WE'VE GOT ANOTHER JOB TO DO.

145
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,585
当我离开这儿的时候 把我的钱给我然后离我远点
WE DON'T HAVE SHIT TO DO.

146
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,128
JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY AND WALK AWAY, OK?

147
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:23,426
我一度当过警察，但不成功
I PLAYED THAT COP SHIT ONCE.

148
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:30,052
如果你不帮我，我永远也不会把钱还你
I JUST WANT MY MONEY, PLEASE.

149
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,534
IF YOU DON'T HELP ME OUT,

150
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,304
I'M NOT EVER GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK.

151
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:33,895
- 你在跟我开玩笑？ - 不是
YOU'RE FUCKING WITH ME, RIGHT?

152
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:38,978
我非常信任你才把钱给你的，我相信你
NO.

153
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,411
JACK, I GAVE YOU THAT MONEY IN GOOD FAITH

154
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:43,901
- 你现在却告诉我不能给我？ - 你现在认清形势了，犯人
BECAUSE YOU SAID I COULD TRUST YOU.

155
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,916
NOW I CAN'T HAVE MY MONEY?

156
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,518
YEAH, NOW YOU GOT THE PICTURE, CONVICT.

157
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:57,542
- 你搞砸了，哈蒙德 - 我只是自卫
YOU SCREWED UP THIS TIME, HAMMOND.

158
00:14:57,716 --> 00:15:02,010
我为我做的一件案子蹲了两年大牢 我永远也不会否认
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

159
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,132
NOBODY'S BUYING THAT CRAP!

160
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:02,135
I SERVED TWO YEARS FOR A CRIME I DID.

161
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:06,390
但我刚刚因为我没做过的劫案蹲了五年牢
I NEVER FUCKING DENIED THAT.

162
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,273
BUT I SPENT FIVE BULLSHIT YEARS HERE.

163
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,930
谋杀犯蹲的时间也比我短
I NEVER ROBBED NO PAYROLL.

164
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:13,182
你可以住单间了，开门
MURDERERS IN HERE DO LESS TIME THAN ME.

165
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,613
YOU CAN SPEND YOUR REMAINING TIME IN ISOLATION.

166
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,948
OPEN UP.

YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING?

WHISKEY. PUT IT IN A GLASS.

181
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,663
普莱斯先生，这人很悲伤

182
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,386
MR. PRICE, THE MAN IS DISTRESSED.

183
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:04,258
沙漠那烂摊子 让他怀疑你的人能不能干这活儿
THAT MESS YOU MADE IN THE DESERT HAS HIM WONDERING

184
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:07,213
不用担心
IF YOU'LL BE AROUND TO FINISH THE JOB.

185
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,127
NOT TO WORRY.

真正的专业？我看不像
REAL PROS, HUH?

187
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:16,686
干活的时候你不应该惹事生非
NOT FROM WHERE I'M SITTING.

188
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,767
PROS DON'T MAKE MESSES LIKE YOU DID.

189
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,569
DON'T GET THE HEAT JACKED UP

190
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:21,102
如果你想当亡命徒，那就没有规矩
WHEN YOU'RE DOING A JOB.

191
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,341
YOU WANT TO BE AN OUTLAW BUT PLAY BY RULES.

192
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:26,401
- 这是你的哲学？ - 我们是仅存的真正美国人
THERE AIN'T NO RULES.

193
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,711
YOU GIVING ME YOUR PHILOSOPHY?

194
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,315
THAT'S RIGHT, BRO. WE'RE THE ONLY REAL AMERICANS LEFT.

195

我们信仰自由 我们的生活方式一如既往

WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM.

197

在有大城市，律师 有你名字的电脑之前，自由！
WE LIVE THE WAY FOLKS USED TO,

198
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,388
BACK BEFORE THERE WERE BIG CITIES AND LAWYERS

199
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,990
AND COMPUTERS WITH YOUR NAMES IN THEM.

200
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:41,545
那时你们只是一群他妈的奴隶
FREE. THE REST OF YOU

201
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,395
ARE JUST A BUNCH OF FUCKING SLAVES.

202
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:46,541
真的很有趣，普莱斯先生 或许你该参加竞选
YEAH? THAT SOUNDS REAL INTERESTING, MR. PRICE.

203
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,209
我觉得应该告诉你要警惕
MAYBE YOU SHOULD RUN FOR OFFICE.

204
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,803
ALL I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU IS TAKE PRECAUTIONS.

205
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:52,591
你的助手在赛车场被烧焦了
YOUR BACKUP GOT BARBECUED AT A RACE TRACK.

206
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,354
- 这些你知道怎么用吗？ - 没问题，朋友
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT STUFF.

207
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:01,891
- 我当过海军 - 不出所料
NO PROBLEM HERE, FRIEND.

208
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,714
I USED TO BE A MARINE.

209
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:07,441
有麻烦就来找我，你知道号码
I GUESS THAT FIGURES.

211
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,488
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER.

212
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,903

HEY. HEY, COME HERE.

214

你找错姑娘了，我不做那事的
I THINK YOU GOT THE WRONG GIRL. I DON'T DO THAT.

215
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:24,036
来吧，我的朋友和我刚来到这镇子
COME ON. MY FRIEND AND I JUST CAME INTO TOWN.

216
00:18:24,214 --> 00:18:29,457
我们再找这儿的一个妓女 名字叫安琪的
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A WHORE WORKING HERE.

217
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,209
WHAT'S HER NAME?

218
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:32,092
她正在北湾跳舞
NAME'S ANGEL.

219
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,312
ANGEL DON'T WORK HERE ANYMORE.

00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:36,926
- 你呢？ - 我不喜欢这样，放开！
SHE'S IN NORTH BEACH.

00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,183
WELL, YOU'RE HERE. HOW ABOUT YOU?

222

I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS--LET GO!

223
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,320

GO AHEAD, SWEET CHEEKS.

COME HERE.

271
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:21,930
你会遵守你的诺言，是吧？
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

272
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,583
YOU WILL KEEP YOUR PROMISE, RIGHT?

别担心，所有事都办妥
EVERYTHING IS-- DON'T WORRY, EVERYTHING IS COOL.

来这儿的那白人警察是找麻烦的吗？
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

不！我答应过你，所有事都办妥
HE AIN'T NO PROBLEM, IS HE?

277
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,563
NO, HE AIN'T GOING TO FUCK THINGS UP, I PROMISE YOU.

278
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:40,075
但时间可能比我说的要长点
EVERYTHING IS COOL,

279
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,934
BUT...IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAN I SAID.

280
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:45,404
别蒙我了，把钱拿来以保守诺言

281

DON'T BULLSHIT ME, MAN.

我能让你离开这儿，我也能弄死你
SO DON'T ACT LIKE EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING.

285
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:55,348
I CAN GET YOU OUT THERE.

286
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,784
I CAN PULL YOUR FUCKING HEART OUT.

287
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:10,227
- 这都为了什么？ - 赌球的旧账
WHAT WAS ALL THAT GOING ON BACK THERE?

288
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,933
那都是废话，哈蒙德・雷吉
TALKING ABOUT A FOOTBALL BET.

289
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,866
THAT'S A CROCK.

290
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,768
HAMMOND, REGGIE A.

YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS IN THE JOINT FOR?

442
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,751
NO.

443
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:38,017
他涉嫌儿童色情刊物 我今晚必须带他到旧金山
HE'S A CHILD MOLESTER. HE'S INVOLVED IN KIDDIE PORN.

444
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:39,758
I GOT TO GET HIM BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO TONIGHT

445
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:44,029
他要指证主谋，如果今晚我不带他去 主谋便逍遥法外了

446
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,361
SO HE CAN IDENTIFY THE ORGANIZATION'S KINGPIN.

447
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,963
IF I DON'T GET HIM BACK TONIGHT,

448
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,133
THE GOD DAMN KINGPIN WALKS.

449
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:51,409
你想开凯迪拉克去吗？
HEY, REGGIE.

450
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:55,828
我今天很不顺，除了你我什么也不想要
WANT TO RIDE IN A CADILLAC?

451
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,574
I'VE BEEN HAVING A FUCKED-UP DAY.

452
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:59,206
我只是想帮你
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SEE WAS YOU.

453
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:00,046
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.

454
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:03,509
你能赶上巴士，你上次坐巴士很走运
YOU COULD ALWAYS CATCH A BUS.

455
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:06,631
帮我个忙，离我远点
YOU WERE LUCKY WITH THE LAST ONE.

456
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,486
DO ME A FAVOR AND DISAPPEAR.

457
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:09,925
对不起，雷吉，他们放你是让我看着你
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

458
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,921
I'M SORRY, REG.

459
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,757
THEY RELEASED YOU IN MY CUSTODY.

460
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,398
- 你以前见过那些飞车党吗？ - 我的钱在哪儿？
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

461
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,000
YOU EVER SEEN THOSE BIKERS BEFORE?

462
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:27,399
你告诉我冰人为什么想杀你 你就可以拿到钱
MY MEMORY'S BETTER WHEN I GOT MONEY.

463
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,572
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

464
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:32,037
- 问那个有我照片的家伙 - 他说不了了，我杀了他
SOON AS YOU TELL ME

465
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,740
WHY THE ICEMAN WANTS YOU DEAD,

466
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,808
I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY.

467
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,811
ASK THE GUY WHO HAD MY PICTURE.

468
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:35,788
- 他们给你多少钱？ - 他先开枪打我的
HE'S NOT TALKING. I KILLED HIM.

469
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,781
DO THEY PAY YOU BY THE POUND NOW?

470
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:41,036
- 只是我们找不到他的枪 - 你希望得到同情吗？
HE SHOT AT ME FIRST,

471
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,885
ONLY WE CAN'T FIND HIS GUN.

472
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:44,050
我应该在佛罗里达经营我叔叔的二手车生意
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SYMPATHY,

473
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,588
YOU'VE COME TO THE WRONG PERSON.

474
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,623
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OFF TO FLORIDA

475
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:50,754
相反的是我穷困潦倒，被枪打 坐的巴士翻滚了二十次
TO BE IN MY UNCLE'S USED CAR BUSINESS.

476
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,860
INSTEAD I'M WITH YOU, I'M BROKE, I'VE BEEN SHOT AT,

477
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,862
MY BUS FLIPPED 20 TIMES,

478
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:56,140
我弄坏了随身听，我被大卡车撞 所以让我静静
I HAD GLASS IN MY HAIR AND SUIT,

479
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:55,101
BROKE MY WALKMAN AND LOST MY JAMES BROWN TAPE.

480
00:33:56,313 --> 00:34:00,690
生活真是艰难，我碰到了你的朋友 他们对我胸口开了六枪
PLUS I'VE BEEN HIT BY A TRUCK,

481
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,003
SO LEAVE ME ALONE.

482
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,138
LIFE'S TOUGH.

483
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,572
I RAN INTO YOUR FRIENDS, TOO.

484
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:04,643
- 你看上去比死人强点 - 我正戴着这玩意
THEY SHOT ME IN THE CHEST SIX TIMES.

485
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,610
YOU DON'T LOOK BAD FOR A DEAD PERSON.

486
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:08,819
- 为什么？ - 我知道我会遇见你的
I WOULD BE IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS.

487
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,880
WHY DO YOU WEAR THIS?

488
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:14,034
我不想被射向你的流弹所杀
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO SEE YOU.

489
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,817
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET KILLED

490
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,585
BY A BULLET MEANT FOR YOU.

491
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,827
你认为我应该穿一件？
THAT'D BE A HELL OF A WAY TO GO.

492
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,252
大约750美元一件 你出狱时没给你这么多钱
THAT'S VERY SENSITIVE, JACK.

493
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,657
SHOULD I GET ONE OF THESE?

494
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,327
YOU CAN GET THEM AT ANY SPORTING GOODS.

495
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,728
THEY RUN ABOUT $750.

496
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:29,509
- 我希望我的保时捷在你那儿 - 我说了我保管的很好
A LITTLE MORE THAN THEY GAVE YOU.

497
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,099
I HOPE YOU GOT MY PORSCHE.

498
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,101
IT'S SAFE IN THE CITY.

499
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,345
那没什么意义，你说我们有交易 然后你耍了我
I TOOK REAL GOOD CARE OF IT.

500
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:33,839
HEY, MAN, YOU SAID WE HAD A DEAL.

501
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:38,392
你耍了你自己，你偷走了监狱的薪水
YOU FUCKED ME.

502
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,308
I FUCKED YOU?

503
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,709
YOU FUCKED YOURSELF.

504
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:41,897
- 我查过了 - 我是冤枉的
YOU STOLE THE PAYROLL AT THE PRISON.

505
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,581
THEY FOUND THE MONEY IN YOUR CELL.

506
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:47,737
对，有犯人让警卫把钱放到你监舍里的
MOTHERFUCKER, I GOT FRAMED.

507
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,618
SOME CONVICT GOT A GUARD TO OPEN THE CELL,

508
00:34:47,906 --> 00:34:51,275
- 你当然是被冤枉的 - 那你呢？
PUT THE MONEY UNDER THE PILLOW LIKE THE TOOTH FAIRY.

509
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:52,324
YOU GOT FRAMED? THAT'S WHAT EVERY CONVICT SAYS.

510
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:55,496
他们在赛车场没找到那人的枪
THEY NEVER FOUND THAT GUY'S GUN AT THE RACE TRACK.

511
00:34:55,664 --> 00:35:03,126
- 我是警察，你是罪犯 - 所以我说的每句话都是他妈的谎话？
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

512
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,829
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT?

513
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,165
I'M A COP. YOU'RE A CROOK.

514
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,100
JUST BECAUSE I'M A CONVICT, I'M A LIAR?

515
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:06,251
带我去我的车那儿吧，我受够你了
THAT'S RIGHT.

516
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,670
SO JUST SCREW REGGIE HAMMOND!

517
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,471
THAT'S RIGHT.

518
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:11,134
怎么了，你胳膊疼吗？疼的厉害吗？好
JUST TAKE ME TO MY CAR.

519
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:07,806
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

520
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:08,940
YOUR ARM HURT?

521
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,041
YEAH. THANKS TO YOUR FRIENDS.

522
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:15,433
我们有麻烦了，滑头
HURT BAD?

523
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,043
YEAH.

524
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:12,944
GOOD.

525
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,346
YOU HEAR THE NEWS?

526
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:21,473
这些乡下人不是我雇的 所以不要向我投诉
WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE, SLICK.

527
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,584
HEY, MAN, BACK UP.

528
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,319
I DIDN'T HIRE THESE HILLBILLIES,

529
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:25,516
对，B计划，我们找到了一位退伍海军
SO DON'T COMPLAIN TO ME.

530
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,024
YES. PLAN B.

531
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:30,522
唯一的问题是，他也是个乡下人
WE GOT AN EX-MARINE ON THE CASE.

532
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,729
ONLY PROBLEM IS, HE'S A HILLBILLY, TOO.

533
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:33,190
对，等会儿
YEAH.

534
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,731
RIGHT.

535
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,166
LATER.

536
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:45,457
- 你花了多少钱？ - 大概两万五
HOW MUCH OF MY MONEY DID YOU SPEND?

537
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:49,415
- 你说我可以买一辆新车 - 在哪儿呢？
ABOUT 25 GRAND.

538
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,047
YOU SAID I COULD BUY A NEW CAR.

539
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:54,302
- 这就是一辆新车 - 这辆老的就像一堆屎
WELL, WHERE IS IT?

540
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,251
THIS HERE'S THE NEW CAR.

541
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:56,788
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE SAME SHITTY SKY-BLUE CADILLAC YOU HAD BEFORE.

542
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:59,467
我买了同一型号，年份，颜色的 我就喜欢这样的

543
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,658
I BOUGHT THE SAME MODEL, YEAR, COLOR, EVERYTHING THE SAME.

544
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:02,681
你的车和衣服都没变
I GET ATTACHED TO THINGS, REGGIE.

545
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:05,892
- 你女朋友也没变？ - 艾琳？
YOU GOT THE SAME CAR?

546
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:03,929
YEAH.

547
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,030
SAME CLOTHES.

548
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:10,445
- 我不想说这个 - 都闷在自己心里吧
YOU GOT THE SAME GIRL, TOO?

549
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:07,633
ELAINE?

550
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,836
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS SHIT.

551
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:16,232
五年前她和我在市政厅结婚
KEEP IT ALL BALLED UP.

552
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,274
SHE MARRIED ME ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

553
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:20,030
她认为她能让我变成居家男人
DROVE ME TO CITY HALL FOR A QUICK CEREMONY.

554
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,812
SHE FIGURED SHE'D SETTLE ME DOWN.

555
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:22,614
我们分手之前一直住这儿
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVED TILL WE SPLIT UP.

556
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:28,380
我想卖了它，首付用了你的一万二

557
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,385
SHE MOVED UP TO MILL VALLEY.

558
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,886
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SELL IT.

559
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:34,551
你怎么能把我的车停在外面？ 有人偷了怎么办？
12 GRAND OF YOURS WENT FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT.

560
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,691
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE MY CAR OUTSIDE ALL THESE YEARS?

561
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,026
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT IT IN THE GARAGE?

562
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:38,933
我安了防盗系统，只要按这蓝色按钮
WHAT IF SOMEBODY STOLE IT?

563
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:39,598
I HAD AN ALARM PUT IN IT.

564
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:43,810
你不会欣赏什么是有型有款
JUST PUSH THAT BLUE BUTTON THERE.

565
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,735
YOU HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR WHAT'S HYPE.

566
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:47,184
你知道因为这车搞到多少女人？
THAT CAR IS FLY.

567
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,839
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PUSSY I GOT BECAUSE OF THAT CAR?

568
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:58,076
他们炸毁了我的车！

569
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:03,370
- 他们炸毁了我的车！ - 真可惜
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR!

570
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,753
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR!

571
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,489
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR!

572
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:10,295
- 你只会说这个？ - 你今天运气不好
THAT'S A DAMN SHAME.

573
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,658
THEY BLEW UP MY CAR,

574
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,261
AND ALL YOU GOT TO SAY IS IT'S A DAMN SHAME?

575
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:13,834
我对你受够了，我要给我老朋友打电话
NO CAR. NO MONEY. YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY.

576
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,266
THAT'S IT. I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

577
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:16,928
我要借点钱，我要离开！
I'M CALLING SOME OF MY HOMIES.

578
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,135
I'M GETTING A LOAN.

579
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,870
I'M STEPPING THE FUCK OFF.

580
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:28,938
帅哥，过的咋样？我是雷吉・哈蒙德

581
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,180
BUSTER! HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

582
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,858
对，我的兄弟！我出来了，我重返街头
HOW YOU DOING? REGGIE HAMMOND.

583
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,584
YES, MY BROTHER!

584
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,233
是，酷，听着…
I'M OUT, MY MAN. ON THE STREET AGAIN.

585
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:42,742
是的，我知道，我正打算这样做呢 这就是我为什么打电话，我想借点钱
YEAH. YEAH. JUST COOL IT, BROTHER.

586
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,291
NO, NO, NO. LISTEN.

587
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,293
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

588
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,894
THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING ABOUT.

589
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:48,454
我知道还欠你一些，但我刚出狱啊
I NEED A LOAN.

590
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,698
I KNOW I OWE YOU SOME SHIT,

591
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,901
BUT I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

592
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:53,006
听着…我没有抵押品，我刚出狱啊
JUST LISTEN.

593
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,904
I DON'T HAVE NO COLLATERAL.

594
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:57,967
我还需要抵押品吗？ 我是雷吉・哈蒙德啊，嘿…
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

595
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:58,310
WHAT THE FUCK I NEED COLLATERAL FOR?

596
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:01,424
嘿，帅哥？帅哥…
HEY! HEY!

597
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,179
HEY, BUSTER?

598
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,548
BUSTER?

599
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:17,773
- 我听说你的房子被炸了 - 不是我的房子，是车

600
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,495
JACK, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

601
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:23,157
- 你的车被炸了？ - 不是，某人停在前面的
WE GOT REPORTS YOU WERE SHOT

602
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,997
AND YOUR HOUSE BLEW UP.

603
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:19,998
NO, A CAR.

604
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,266
YOUR CAR BLEW UP?

605
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,668
IT WASN'T MY CAR.

606
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,328
- 有那些飞车党的资料吗？ - 没有，我再找找
IT WAS SOME OTHER GUY'S CAR.

607
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,272
ANYTHING COME IN ON THOSE BIKERS?

608
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:34,382
你必须得去看看威尔逊，如果你不去 他就会派人来找你
NOT YET. I'LL CHECK AGAIN.

609
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:31,142
DO ME A FAVOR AND GO SEE WILSON.

610
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,545
HE SAID IF YOU DON'T SEE HIM,

611
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,846
HE'LL SEND SOMEBODY OUT TO GET YOU.

612
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:35,947
SHIT.

613
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:39,595
杰克，你还好吧？
HEY, JACK. YOU OK?

614
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:56,149
你给了他一张票？好的，他讨厌警察
YOU GIVING THAT GUY A TICKET?

615
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:59,607
- 是吗？ - 是的，他载我过来的
GOOD. HE HATES COPS.

616
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,471
HE DOES, HUH?

617
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:03,733
他说警察都是藏在警徽后面的娘们
I RODE HERE WITH HIM.

618
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,509
HE SAID COPS AIN'T SHIT.

619
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:07,992
他说他才不管是不是禁停区
YOU WAS JUST PUSSIES HIDING BEHIND YOUR BADGES.

620
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,914
HE SAID HE'LL PARK THIS CAR--

621
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:12,116
他说那样某个警察就要倒霉了
HE DON'T CARE IF IT'S A NO-PARKING ZONE.

622
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,951
HE SAID TELL THE COP TO KISS HIS ASS.

623
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:16,924
你的朋友不太聪明
SO KISS HIS ASS.

624
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,524
YOUR FRIEND'S NOT TOO SMART.

625
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:20,512
他是一个大块头的蠢警察，名叫杰克・凯茨
YEAH. I KNOW.

626
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,327
HE'S A BIG DUMB-ASS COP NAMED JACK CATES.

627
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,177
告诉凯茨不要停在这儿
SHIT. TELL CATES TO STOP PARKING

628
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,065
IN FRONT OF THE STATION.

629
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,351
你好，杰克

630
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:40,319
摩托车赛道，然后是餐厅 现在你家有个炸弹
HELLO, JACK.

631
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,778
FIRST THE MOTORCYCLE TRACK, THEN THE DINER.

632
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,863
冰人很忙
NOW WE FOUND A BOMB AT YOUR HOUSE?

633
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:47,996
我不是来这儿跟你吵的，我是来帮你的
AND THE ICEMAN'S RESPONSIBLE, RIGHT?

634
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,653
I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH YOU.

635
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:53,123
但是，作为内务部主管，我必须告诉你
I'M HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

636
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,757
HOWEVER, AS SUPERVISOR OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS,

637
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,759
IT'S MY JOB TO TELL YOU

638
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:58,087
在明天聆讯之前你是暂时停职的
YOU'RE STILL ON SUSPENSION,

639
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,363
AT LEAST UNTIL THE COURT HEARING TOMORROW.

640
00:39:58,258 --> 00:40:02,126
所以把枪，警徽，还有工作证给我
SO WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT GUN

641
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,795
是啊，好吧
AND YOUR BADGE AND POLICE I.D.?

642
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:08,757
我敢打赌你认为我喜欢这样
YEAH. RIGHT.

643
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,441
I'LL BET YOU THINK I ENJOY THIS, DON'T YOU?

644
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:14,809
杰克，帮我个忙，回家睡觉

645
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,912
JACK, DO ME A FAVOR.

646
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,815
GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP.

647
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:23,905
我得走了，还有报告要弄
I GOT TO CHECK OUT A FEW THINGS,

648
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,421
MAKE OUT SOME REPORTS.

649
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:29,746
我不介意有人调查警察 我们不能凌驾于法律之上
I DON'T MIND PEOPLE CHECKING UP ON COPS.

650
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:34,541
但让警察自己调查自己会影响士气 对警察没什么好处
I DON'T THINK WE'RE ABOVE THE LAW.

651
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,964
BUT MAKING COPS DO IT,

652
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,099
IT'S BAD FOR MORALE.

653
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:40,382
应该让平民做这个 你真是一个胆小鬼，威尔逊
IT'S BAD FOR COPS.

654
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,869
CIVILIANS OUGHT TO DO IT.

655
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,431
也许不是你的错，也许你只是职责所在
YOU'RE A REAL CHICKENSHIT, WILSON.

656
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,512
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

657
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,446
MAYBE IT'S YOUR JOB.

658
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:59,397
好吧

659
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,858
ALL RIGHT.

660
00:41:21,383 --> 00:41:25,677
马文，过的好吗？雷吉・哈蒙德…哈蒙德

661
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:23,782
YO, MARVIN!

662
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:25,216
HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

663
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:30,306
你好吗？我刚出来，是的兄弟
REGGIE HAMMOND.

664
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,385
HA-HAMMOND.

665
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:30,388
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

666
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:35,351
什么？你是重生的基督信徒？拉倒吧
I JUST GOT OUT.

667
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,991
YEAH, LISTEN.

668
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:33,792
WHAT?

669
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,426
YOU A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN?

670
00:41:35,522 --> 00:41:38,476
我怎么看你也不像一个重生的基督信徒
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

671
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,830
I JUST CAN'T PICTURE YOU BEING--

672
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,939
我曾目睹你殴打那个妓女
I WAS THERE WHEN YOU BEAT THE BITCH UP.

673
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:45,275
不，每个人都可以找到耶稣，我爱耶稣
NO. DON'T GET ME WRONG.

674
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,836
I KNOW YOU CAN FIND JESUS.

675
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:50,194
我爱耶稣，我爱耶稣，喂？喂…
EVERYBODY CAN FIND JESUS.

676
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,540
I LOVE JESUS. I LOVE JESUS.

677
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,141
I LOVE--HELLO?

678
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:55,910
威利・百吉斯，雷吉・哈蒙德 喂…？该死的黑鬼！
HELLO? HELLO? MARVIN?

679
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,545
HEY, WILLIE BIGGS!

680
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:54,546
REGGIE HAMMOND.

681
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,547
HELLO? HELLO?

682
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,849
BLACK MOTHERFUCKER.

683
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:06,044
过去四天里有飞车党涉及13宗案件
HERE YOU GO, JACK.

684
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:07,826
13 COMPLAINTS INVOLVING BIKERS IN THE LAST FOUR DAYS.

685
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:10,383
- 两宗交通事故，一宗北湾闹事 - 用电脑查这些人

686
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:10,228
TWO TRAFFICS AND A D AND D IN NORTH BEACH.

687
00:42:10,557 --> 00:42:15,682
我会让克鲁斯去做的，我看他不像飞车党
RUN THEM THROUGH THE NCIC.

688
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,032
I'LL HAVE CRUISE DO IT.

689
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,736
DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A BIKER TO ME.

690
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:19,352
跟你谈话很愉快

691
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,238
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

692
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:28,405
- 你还在这儿？ - 我不喜欢待在这儿
YOU STILL HERE?

693
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,779
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D STICK AROUND.

694
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:34,448
我应该自由自在的，过自己的生活 而不是跟你们这帮蠢材纠缠不清
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT BEING HERE.

695
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:33,184
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE A FREE MAN WITH MONEY IN MY POCKET.

696
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,834
- 欢迎回来 - 离我远点，我不是犯人
I DON'T WANT TO BE TIED TO YOUR WHITE ASS AGAIN.

697
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,856
WELCOME BACK, REG.

698
00:42:39,002 --> 00:42:44,507
我自由了，你就快去我昨天待的地方了 你管不了事了
GET THE FUCK OFF ME.

699
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:42,160
I AIN'T NO CONVICT. I'M A FREE MAN.

700
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,762
YOU'RE ALMOST WHERE I WAS YESTERDAY.

701
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:48,174
我不是给你干活，我也不喜欢你
YOU AIN'T RUNNING JACK SHIT.

702
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,766
I AIN'T WORKING FOR YOU,

703
00:42:48,345 --> 00:42:52,343
别说废话了，给我些有用的东西
I DON'T LIKE YOU, AND I DON'T TRUST YOU.

704
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,903
NOW JUST CUT THE BULLSHIT.

705
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:56,430
冰人买了你的房子
GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN USE, REGGIE.

706
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,774
THE ICEMAN?

707
00:42:56,603 --> 00:43:02,273
- 别说废话了！ - 你还是没搞清楚
THE ICEMAN BOUGHT YOUR HOUSE.

708
00:42:58,343 --> 00:42:59,745
NOW GOD DAMN IT,

709
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,412
I SAID CUT THE BULLSHIT.

710
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:08,148
甘孜和我拿了冰人50万美元 他现在还在生气呢
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T PUT THIS TOGETHER YET.

711
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,917
ME AND GANZ ROBBED SOMEBODY

712
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,352
FOR $500,000 A COUPLE YEARS BACK.

713
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:08,486
THAT WAS THE ICEMAN.

714
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:12,609
看见有些人如何被金钱影响真是让人惊奇
HE'S STILL PISSED OFF.

715
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,523
AMAZING HOW MONEY AFFECTS SOME PEOPLE.

716
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:16,202
对，你一直在找的人…
I SEE YOUR WHEELS TURNING.

717
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,895
THE MAN YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

718
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:22,791
给你买了他妈的车和付了房款的首付
BOUGHT YOUR FUCKED-UP CAR

719
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:21,566
AND PUT A DOWN PAYMENT ON YOUR HOUSE.

720
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:26,711
那让你成为了全体执法人员里 最蠢的一个混蛋
YOU'RE RIDING IN HIS CAR LOOKING FOR HIM,

721
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:27,438
WHICH MAKES YOU THE DUMBEST MOTHERFUCKER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

722
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:32,969
我来开车，你搞砸了 与你不同，我活的很有意义
GET IN THE CAR. I'M DRIVING.

723
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:30,742
YOU GOT A FUCKED-UP ARM.

724
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:31,943
I'M NOT GETTING IN ANOTHER WRECK.

725
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,213
I, UNLIKE YOU, HAVE A LOT TO LIVE FOR.

726
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:41,553
我总想有个司机
I ALWAYS WANTED A CHAUFFEUR, REGGIE.

727
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:47,601
我认识袭击巴士的那些飞车党中的一个 柴瑞・甘孜

728
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:47,793
I RECOGNIZED ONE OF THOSE BIKERS THAT ATTACKED THE BUS.

729
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:51,729
他是甘孜的弟弟，和他相比 甘孜简直就是甘地
HIS NAME IS CHERRY GANZ. HE'S GANZ' BROTHER.

730
00:43:51,908 --> 00:43:58,161
- 为什么冰人要用他？ - 我帮你杀了他哥哥
GANZ' BROTHER?

731
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,899
HE MAKES GANZ LOOK LIKE GANDHI.

732
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:56,167
WHY WOULD THE ICEMAN HIRE GANZ' BROTHER?

733
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,569
I RATTED GANZ TO YOU, AND YOU KILLED GANZ.

734
00:43:58,332 --> 00:44:02,661
甘孜说他的弟弟 跟一个叫安琪的妓女有来往
WHO'D WANT TO KILL US MORE?

735
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,507
GANZ SAID HIS BROTHER FUCKED THIS BITCH NAMED ANGEL.

736
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:10,084
- 她在谷仓酒吧工作 - 我们曾收到那酒吧的投诉
HE SAID HOW INSANE THE PUSSY WAS.

737
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,913
SAID THE BITCH WORKED AT BARNSTORMERS.

738
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:10,581
A COUPLE BIKERS ROUSTED A BAR CALLED BARNSTORMERS.

739
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,594
警察们到底有没有开始调查？
THE COPS ARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INVESTIGATION?

740
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:17,761
在监狱里待了7年怎么还记得这么多？
I'M SHOCKED.

741
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:18,289
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE THIS GIRL WORKS

742
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:22,727
在监狱里你会记得所有关于娘们的事情
AFTER SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON?

743
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,426
AFTER SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON,

744
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:24,796
YOU REMEMBER EVERY STORY ABOUT PUSSY, TRUST ME.

745
00:44:31,031 --> 00:44:33,439
等下，我要拿点东西
WAIT. I GOT TO GET SOMETHING.

746
00:44:34,451 --> 00:44:37,405
杰克，这是假的

747
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,450
我要把它快速的晃动
HEY, JACK...

748
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,144
THIS SHIT IS FAKE.

749
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,012
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

750
00:44:41,124 --> 00:44:45,667
如果有人说是假的，你就麻烦大了
WHEN YOU FLASH IT FAST.

751
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,149
SOMEBODY SPOOKS THAT FAKE BADGE

752
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,752
AND YOU GET YOUR ASS WHIPPED,

753
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:48,922
你还是为自己操操心吧，雷吉
DON'T COME CRYING TO ME.

754
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,121
WATCH YOUR OWN ASS, REGGIE.

755
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,232
<i>我们真心相爱，那是一种…</i>
* WE WERE TWO LOVERS *

756
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:13,689
<i>你有幸找到的双向的爱</i>
* ONE OF A KIND *

757
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:15,781
* WE'VE SHARED LOVE THAT FEW ARE LUCKY TO FIND... *

758
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:20,407
我要去盘问那个投诉的酒吧女

759
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,118
I'LL GO GET SOME INFO.

760
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,163
你干你警察的活儿，我去找那些妓女
A BARMAID CALLED IN THE COMPLAINT.

761
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,922
YOU GO DO YOUR COP SHIT, JACK.

762
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:25,824
I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT THESE WHORES.

763
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,226
* NOT TOO LONG AGO YOU CAME AFTER ME *

764
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,862
* BUT NOW IT SEEMS YOU FORGET A GUY CAN SEE *

765
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:33,598
* I'M A-BEGGING FOR LOVE *

766
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,266
* I CAN'T BREAK FREE *

767
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,641
嘿！是你投诉飞车党的吗？
* YOU'RE ALL THAT I NEED... **

768
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:42,707
YOU THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT SOME BIKERS?

769
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:45,021
你们终于有反应了 只不过晚了一天半而已

770
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,110
CALL THE NEWS. COP FINALLY RESPONDED.

771
00:45:45,188 --> 00:45:50,147
- 你还要继续投诉吗？ - 当我们需要你们的时候你们却不在
IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY AND A HALF.

772
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,014
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK OR BITCH?

773
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,950
YOU'RE NEVER HERE WHEN SOMEBODY NEEDS YOU.

774
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,065
能给我来杯伏特加吗？你好吗？
CAN I HAVE A SHOT OF STOLI?

775
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,453
ON THE ROCKS?

776
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:59,859
- 嗨，请我喝一杯？ - 我刚出大牢，我穷的要命
YEAH. GREAT.

777
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,856
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

778
00:45:57,856 --> 00:45:59,457
BUY ME A DRINK?

779
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,278
- 但你可以请我喝一杯 - 滚一边儿去
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

780
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,194
YOU CAN BUY MY DRINK.

781
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,230
FUCK OFF.

782
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:14,503
我认识你，对吗？你曾经伤过我的心
HI.

783
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,338
I KNOW YOU, RIGHT?

784
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:14,772
YEAH, YOU DO.

785
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:16,677
- 这次我不会让你跑掉 - 我马上回来
YOU BROKE MY HEART ONCE.

786
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,275
DID I?

787
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,977
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GET AWAY THIS TIME.

788
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:22,847
我要补补妆
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

789
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:21,980
WE COULD TAKE MINE.

790
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,883
I HAVE TO POWDER MY NOSE.

791
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:41,659
- 嘿，你好吗？ - 不错，你好吗？

792
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:38,563
HEY!

793
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:39,965
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,833
PRETTY GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

795
00:46:41,828 --> 00:46:45,079
你有没有看过那些电视广告？
ALL RIGHT.

796
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:45,736
YOU EVER SEE THOSE COMMERCIALS ON TV

797
00:46:45,248 --> 00:46:48,914
- 卡尔・莫尔登 - 是的，那个大鼻子
WITH THE, UH, TOURISTS?

798
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:48,974
WITH THE GUY WITH THE BIG NOSE?

799
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:54,424
你看过他们以慢动作显示人们如何被扒？
KARL MALDEN.

800
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,609
THE BIG-ASS NOSE MAN.

801
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,812
YOU SEE THOSE COMMERCIALS WHERE HE SHOWS

802
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,381
PEOPLE GETTING THEIR POCKETS PICKED?

803
00:46:58,053 --> 00:47:01,137
- 倒霉！ - 对于那事倒霉是个很好的形容词
YEAH.

804
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,651
SHIT!

805
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:04,640
- 我可以拿回你的钱 - 要多少酬劳？
SHIT IS A GOOD WORD TO SAY THERE.

806
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,255
I CAN GET YOUR MONEY BACK,

807
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,642
- 我想大概一家一半 - 平分？不要这样对我
BUT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU.

808
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:06,491
HOW MUCH?

809
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,994
I THINK HALF YOUR MONEY WOULD BE GOOD.

810
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:12,479
我对你够不错了，你现在可啥都没有
GIVE ME A BREAK!

811
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,562
I'M GIVING YOU A BREAK.

812
00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:16,435
她会使用你的信用卡，你的信用要出问题了
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING NOW.

813
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,399
THE BITCH IS COUNTING YOUR MONEY.

814
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,601
SHE'S GOT YOUR CREDIT CARDS,

815
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:20,231
- 如果你不愿意，那就算了 - 成交
RUN YOUR RATES UP,

816
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,704
YOUR CREDIT'S GOING TO BE FUCKED UP.

817
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:26,079
他询问我关于在这儿工作的一个姑娘 他真的很粗鲁
YOU GOT A DEAL.

818
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:26,144
THE DARK-HAIRED GUY ASKED ABOUT A GIRL WHO WORKED HERE.

819
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:29,866
- 然后那个金毛拿出一把枪 - 那个姑娘怎么样了？
HE STARTS GRABBING ME.

820
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,615
THE BLOND ONE PULLS OUT A GUN.

821
00:47:30,043 --> 00:47:35,038
安琪，她在北湾的鸟笼酒吧跳舞
WHAT ABOUT THIS GIRL?

822
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:34,385
ANGEL STOP WORKING HERE A YEAR AGO.

823
00:47:35,215 --> 00:47:40,340
- 你为什么不把这些写下来？ - 我记性好，你知道地址？
SHE'S DANCING AT THE BIRD CAGE.

824
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,823
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING THIS DOWN?

825
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,825
I GOT A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.

826
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,260
YOU GOT HER ADDRESS?

827
00:47:57,529 --> 00:48:02,524
- 这是女厕 - 不关你事

828
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:00,745
THIS IS THE LADIES' ROOM.

829
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:01,947
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

830
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:03,581
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

831
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:06,534
嘿…
HEY.

832
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:12,375
我觉得我们应该好好认识一下 你挺麻利的
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

833
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:10,956
FOR US TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

834
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,358
YOU'RE VERY SMOOTH. VERY, VERY SMOOTH.

835
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,498
我见过很多扒手，但没见过这么麻利的
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF POCKETS PICKED,

836
00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:22,719
那家伙很不开心 我告诉他可以拿回一半的钱
BUT NO ONE AS SMOOTH AS YOU.

837
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,364
I WAS TALKING TO THE GUY YOU HIT.

838
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:20,465
HE'S UPSET.

839
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:23,901
I TOLD HIM I'D GET HALF HIS MONEY BACK.

840
00:48:22,888 --> 00:48:28,677
如果你收买我 我可以告诉他你很狡猾我对付不了
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU OFFER ME A LITTLE BRIBE.

841
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:30,608
THEN I'LL TELL HIM YOU WERE TOO FAST FOR ME.

842
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:31,687
我狡猾的难以对付

843
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:33,578
I AM TOO FAST FOR YOU.

844
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:40,982
哦，嗨，差不多完事了

845
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,087
HI. ALMOST FINISHED.

846
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:49,036
- 还有其他人吗？ - 没了，只有这三个

847
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,660
WAS ANYBODY ELSE WITH THEM?

848
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:54,117
有一个瘦瘦的黑人 那个年岁大的正跟他谈话
NO. JUST THE THREE OF THEM.

849
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,697
THERE WAS THIS BLACK GUY.

850
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:56,467
THE OLDEST ONE WAS TALKING TO A BLACK GUY.

851
00:48:54,294 --> 00:48:58,873
黑人？跟这个像吗？

852
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:57,868
A BLACK GUY, HUH?

853
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:04,803
是的，就是他，他还不错，没骚扰我
WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

854
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,406
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

855
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:02,873
HE WAS OK.

856
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,275
HE DIDN'T BOTHER ME.

857
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:10,595
如果他们再来就报警，找基欧探员
IF THEY COME IN AGAIN,

858
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,279
CALL DOWN TO THE DEPARTMENT.

859
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,881
YOU ASK FOR INSPECTOR BEN KEHOE.

860
00:49:11,937 --> 00:49:15,769
- 这是你的那一半钱 - 我的信用卡呢？
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

861
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:16,121
YOU'RE LUCKY. HERE'S HALF YOUR MONEY.

862
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:20,567
这交易只是要钱，你的信用卡在厕所呢
WHAT ABOUT MY CREDIT CARDS?

863
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,257
WE HAD NO CREDIT CARD DEAL.

864
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:22,560
YOUR CARDS ARE STILL IN THE BATHROOM.

865
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:28,661
<i>你必须付出你全部所得</i>

866
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,200
* GOT TO GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT *

867
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,568
* TILL YOU DROP *

868
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,712
* NOW SOMETIMES YOU WIN *

869
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:47,591
- 杰克・凯茨，记得我吗？ - 我没印象了
* SOMETIMES YOU LOSE *

870
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:44,982
JACK CATES?

871
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,718
REMEMBER ME?

872
00:49:47,764 --> 00:49:50,884
我在车后座搞一个姑娘时你拘捕了我
NAH. I DON'T THINK SO.

873
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:52,157
YOU BUSTED ME IN A CAMARO WITH A GIRL.

874
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:55,223
- 听起来不像我 - 后来才知道她未成年
THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE ME.

875
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:59,477
- 糟糕的事情发生了 - 我没有偷车，我朋友干的
TURNS OUT SHE WAS UNDERAGE,

876
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,695
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT.

877
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:58,696
SHIT HAPPENS.

878
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:04,479
- 你应该挑些好朋友 - 我被判入狱两年
MY BUDDY STOLE THE CAR.

879
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,101
MAYBE YOU BETTER PICK BETTER BUDDIES.

880
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,103
I GOT TO SEE SOMEBODY.

881
00:50:04,656 --> 00:50:07,527
我不想在酒吧打架
I GOT TWO YEARS.

882
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:11,533
人们经常在酒吧打架，不老套吗？
GIVE ME A BREAK.

883
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:09,340
I DON'T WANT TO GET IN A BAR FIGHT.

884
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,576
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GETTING IN BAR FIGHTS.

885
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:14,955
你可以在电影里看到的情节
IT'S A DAMN CLICHE.

886
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,979
YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT IT.

887
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:20,998
人们被啤酒瓶和家具敲脑袋…
YOU SEE IT IN MOVIES.

888
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:19,350
PEOPLE GET HIT IN THE HEAD

889
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,187
WITH BEER BOTTLES AND FURNITURE.

890
00:51:15,102 --> 00:51:17,937
我要踢你两年屁股！
I'M TAKING TWO YEARS OUT OF YOUR ASS, CATES!

891
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:21,189
你有手枪吗？说不定他们有防备

892
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,246
YOU GOT A GUN?

893
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,148
IN CASE THEY STICK THE PLACE UP.

894
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:36,987
好了，不要闹了
ALL RIGHT.

895
00:51:37,165 --> 00:51:42,077
我今天很倒霉，我刚刚出狱
KNOCK THIS SHIT OFF.

896
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:41,999
I'VE BEEN HAVING A VERY BAD DAY.

897
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:47,545
我被人枪击，坐的巴士翻了17个滚
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL THIS MORNING.

898
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,103
ALREADY I'VE BEEN SHOT AT,

899
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,440
MY BUS FLIPPED OVER 17 TIMES,

900
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:54,515
一个妓女想用刀捅我 有人炸了我的保时捷

901
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,909
A BITCH TRIED TO STAB ME IN THE BATHROOM,

902
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:54,044
AND SOMEBODY BLEW UP MY PORSCHE.

903
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:57,518
我通常见死不救的
I'M IN A BAD MOOD.

904
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,715
I USUALLY DON'T JUMP IN

905
00:51:57,686 --> 00:52:00,853
但是杰克・凯茨要帮我解决一些事情
WHEN SOMEBODY'S GETTING BEAT DOWN,

906
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:03,554
BUT THIS MAN WILL HELP ME STRAIGHTEN UP MY DAY.

907
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:06,609
- 现在我们谈正经事吧 - 因为你有枪？

908
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,890
BACK UP AND LET US GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS.

909
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:12,532
- 因为我会一枪打穿你的屁股 - 你没胆这样做的
BECAUSE YOU GOT A GUN?

910
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:10,761
NO. BECAUSE I HAVE A GUN AND I'LL SHOOT YOU.

911
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:14,499
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT THE GUTS TO USE IT.

912
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:22,579
还有人相当瘸子吗？

913
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:24,275
ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO LIMP?

914
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:29,751
为那个膝盖道歉，我有点紧张

915
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,479
SORRY ABOUT THE KNEECAP.

916
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:33,924
- 你真会调查 - 你跟我玩失踪
I GOT A LITTLE EXCITED.

917
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:33,418
YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE AN INVESTIGATION.

918
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:40,100
- 想不到我得救你 - 我不稀罕你的帮助
YOU DISAPPEARED. WHERE WERE YOU?

919
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,422
I WAS IN THE BATHROOM.

920
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:38,989
THEN I GOT TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

921
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,391
I DIDN'T NEED YOU.

922
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,649
我应该带备用手枪的
I WAS PROTECTING MY MONEY.

923
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,395
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE IN THERE

924
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:49,313
然后我在酒吧打成一团 上帝啊，杰克，你在干什么？
WITHOUT MY SPARE GUN.

925
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:49,300
I GET INTO A GOD DAMN BAR FIGHT.

926
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:52,572
- 嘿！ - 这是为了什么？
JACK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

927
00:52:52,741 --> 00:52:57,202
这是为了那个篮球，现在我们扯平了 我们可以重新开始
HEY!

928
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,405
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

929
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:57,007
FOR THE BASKETBALL. NOW WE'RE EVEN.

930
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:00,407
我要离开这儿，交易结束了
WE CAN START FRESH.

931
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,212
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE, OR I'LL DO A HOMICIDE.

932
00:53:00,582 --> 00:53:04,911
- 真讨厌！ - 废话，上车
THE DEAL IS OFF.

933
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,614
THE DEAL'S OFF, BULLSHIT.

934
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,684
LET'S GO. GET IN THE CAR.

935
00:53:05,712 --> 00:53:08,630
你是不是从小就讨厌，或者受过训练？
COME ON.

936
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:12,713
不要这么耿耿于怀，来吧，走吧
DID YOU TAKE LESSONS TO BE A SHITHEAD?

937
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,857
I WAS JUST GETTING EVEN.

938
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:18,343
- 他妈的离我远点 - 别犯傻了
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

939
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:16,861
I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY.

940
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,263
I MEAN IT.

941
00:53:18,517 --> 00:53:23,594
- 你要去哪儿？ - 离你远远的
HEY, DON'T BE STUPID.

942
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,266
WHERE YOU GOING?

943
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,867
AWAY! AWAY FROM YOU.

944
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:28,683
你的线索是有用的 甘孜的女友住在金美酒店
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.

945
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,070
YOUR TIP TURNED OUT OK.

946
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:31,609
GANZ' GIRL LIVES IN THE TENDERLOIN AT THE KING MEI HOTEL.

947
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:34,280
再见，杰克，去死吧，杰克

948
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:32,810
BYE, JACK.

949
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,446
FUCK YOU, JACK.

950
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,659
靠！

00:53:52,301 --> 00:53:55,171
这是其中一名飞车党的资料

952
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:59,924
甘孜・理查德，西部兄弟会摩托帮成员
HERE'S THE STORY ON ONE OF THE BIKERS.

953
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,803

72 OUTSTANDING TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

957
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:07,745
L.A. BIKE GANGS?

958
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,348
LAPD TRACKED SOMETHING ON THEM A FEW MINUTES AGO.

959
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,942
- 我马上到 - 他是暂时停职！
MORE IS SUPPOSED TO COME IN.

960
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,285
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

961
00:54:14,114 --> 00:54:17,649
这不是一个好主意，威尔逊正在找你
THEN WHY IS HE ON THE STREETS?

962
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,389
COMING TO THE STATION AIN'T A GOOD IDEA.

963
00:54:17,826 --> 00:54:20,910
老天啊！他知道酒吧的事了
WILSON'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

964
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:22,693

- 黑考克・甘孜 - 他是阿尔伯特・甘孜的弟弟

974
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:51,188
HICKOK. GANZ.

975
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:53,123
THIS GUY IS ALBERT GANZ' BROTHER.

976
00:54:52,694 --> 00:54:57,155
他们是警察杀手，5天前刚枪杀了两个警察
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.

977
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:57,995
THEY'RE COP KILLERS. CAPPED TWO CHIPs AND A BYSTANDER.

978
00:54:57,324 --> 00:55:02,116
特别调查科说他们是帮会的执行人
A SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS GUY IN L.A. SAID

979
00:55:02,287 --> 00:55:06,202
他们跟15宗死亡案件有关，刹车，刹车！
THESE GUYS ARE ENFORCERS FOR THEIR GANG, THE BROTHERHOOD.

980
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:07,104
THEY'VE BEEN LINKED TO OVER 15 DEATHS.

981
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:12,041
- 还有其它资料吗？ - 没什么有价值的了
BRAKE! BRAKE!

982
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:11,476
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE?

983
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,344
NAH. NOTHING HARD.

984
00:55:15,509 --> 00:55:17,632
- 往那边开 - 小菜一碟
JACK, JUST GO AROUND THE BLOCK.

985
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,717
IT'S TOO EASY.

986
00:55:26,561 --> 00:55:31,058
科克兰德・史密斯，有电话找你 是雷吉・哈蒙德

987
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,794
KIRKLAND SMITH!

988
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:30,795
YEAH!

989
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:33,063
YOU GOT A PHONE CALL. REGGIE HAMMOND.

990
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:40,950
- 雷吉，搞定了没有？ - 有点复杂了…

991
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,601
REGGIE?

992
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:37,868
HEY, KIRK. WHAT'S UP?

993
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,069
IS IT DONE?

994
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:42,940
LOOK, IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

995
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:44,736
不要糊弄我，你不再是一个公民了

996
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,341
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

997
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:49,242
你不能投票，没人会雇你，你被抛弃了
YOU AIN'T A CITIZEN NO MORE.

998
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,380
YOU CAN'T VOTE. NOBODY WILL HIRE YOU.

999
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:53,795
你现在只剩下你的承诺了，不要对我食言
YOU'RE AN OUTCAST. NOBODY WANTS YOU.

1000
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:54,118
ALL YOU GOT LEFT IS YOUR WORD.

1001
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,820
DON'T BREAK YOUR WORD TO ME.

1002
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,071
好地方，怎么这么久才到？
NICE PLACE, HUH?

1003
00:56:29,249 --> 00:56:35,169
我还以为你又退出了呢 为了啥你恋恋不舍的？
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

1004
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,091
I THOUGHT YOU QUIT FOR THE FIFTH TIME.

1005
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:39,632
我会继续下去，我们要彻底解决这事
YOU CAN'T STAY AWAY?

1006
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:37,227
I'M GOING TO HANG.

1007
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,229
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN THIS SHIT OUT.

1008
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:42,719
但是，如果你再打我，如果你再抓着我…
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1009
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,602
IF YOU HIT ME, GRAB ME, TOUCH ME,

1010
00:56:42,888 --> 00:56:46,173
如果你的手再碰我…

1011
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:48,172
IF YOUR HAND BRUSHES AGAINST ME LIGHTLY,

1012
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:51,012
- 我会杀了你 - 我会好好对你的

1013
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,974
I'LL KILL YOU. I'M SERIOUS.

1014
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:56,562
这次我放过你，因为你很疼，哪只手来着？
DON'T WORRY. I'LL TREAT YOU RIGHT.

1015
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:55,580
I LET THINGS PASS BECAUSE YOU GOT SHOT,

1016
00:56:56,735 --> 00:57:01,860
左手，医生说伤口深至骨头
AND YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN.

1017
00:56:58,182 --> 00:56:59,584
WHICH ARM IS IT?

1018
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,620
LEFT. DOC SAYS IT'S BRUISED TO THE BONE.

1019
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:07,820
- 现在我们打成平手了！ - 只是篮球的事摆平了
THAT'S A DEEP BRUISE.

1020
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:05,155
NOW WE EVEN, MOTHERFUCKER.

1021
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:09,760
I JUST GOT EVEN FOR THE BASKETBALL, YOU SON OF A BITCH!

1022
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:10,570
先把钱还我，然后你可以用球打我

1023
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,364
RETURN MY MONEY, THEN YOU CAN HIT ME WITH THE BALL.

1024
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:17,625
等下，我们去找这女的谈谈

1025
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,766
WAIT A MINUTE, REG.

1026
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,570
WE'RE GOING TO JUST GO AND TALK TO THIS GIRL.

1027
00:57:17,798 --> 00:57:22,625
- 别耍我，杰克 - 我们就是去找她谈谈而已

1028
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,171
DON'T SNEAK ME, JACK.

1029
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,775
IF SHE'S HERE, WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO HER.

1030
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:27,429
这是警察的一般性工作

1031
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:29,113
THIS IS JUST STRAIGHT-AHEAD COP STUFF, ISN'T IT?

1032
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,849
谢谢你

1185
01:07:51,056 --> 01:07:53,927
我只抓坏人的
WHOSE RIGHTS YOU VIOLATED.

1186
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,471
I JUST ARREST CROOKS, I DON'T MAKE THEM STEAL.

1187
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:59,688
你的意思是说他们只配当坏人
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

1188
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:58,242
EVERYBODY WENT TO A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,

1189
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:01,478
AND CROOK WAS THE ONLY JOB THEY WAS QUALIFIED FOR.

1190
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:05,361
这故事不错，抱怨社会吧

1191
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:03,747
THAT'S A GOOD STORY, REGGIE.

1192
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,549
BLAME IT ON SOCIETY.

1193
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:10,654
如果大便也值钱，穷人便会天生没屁眼
PUT IT ON SOCIETY'S SHOULDERS.

1194
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,553
IF SHIT WAS WORTH SOMETHING,

1195
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:12,689
POOR PEOPLE WOULD BE BORN WITH NO ASSHOLES.

1196
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:14,691
[RING]

1197
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:17,927
[RING]

1198
01:08:16,623 --> 01:08:20,158
是我，我听到了消息
YEAH, IT'S ME.

1199
01:08:20,335 --> 01:08:24,831
我警告过你要小心那些疯狂的枪手的
I HEARD ABOUT IT.

1200
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,899
WELL, HEY, MAN, I WARNED YOU

1201
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,502
ABOUT DEALING WITH THESE CRAZY-ASS CRACKERS.

1202
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:29,834
不，我不用，那不是我的风格
WHAT? NO, I AIN'T CARRYING.

1203
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:30,507
THAT AIN'T MY THING. YOU KNOW THAT.

1204
01:08:30,012 --> 01:08:34,305
我也是一个生意人，但我不想离他们太近
LOOK, I'M A BUSINESSMAN, TOO,

1205
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:35,912
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO THESE GUYS.

1206
01:08:34,474 --> 01:08:40,394
这些人剥夺了我工作的全部乐趣
THESE GUYS ARE TAKING THE FUN OUT OF MY WORK.

1207
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:42,853
我记得
RIGHT.

1208
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:44,454
YEAH, I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER.

1209
01:08:44,401 --> 01:08:47,521
你不用提醒我
I SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ME OF IT, OK?

1210
01:08:47,696 --> 01:08:51,776
别担心，我会安排妥当
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1211
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,529
I'LL PULL IT TOGETHER.

1212
01:09:08,383 --> 01:09:11,420
科克兰德，有人找你
GOOD MORNING, KIRKLAND. YOU GOT SOME VISITORS.

1213
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:25,295
HEY, MAN, WOULD YOU SHUT UP OVER THERE?

1214
01:09:46,713 --> 01:09:50,331
把那人的照片拿来

1215
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:51,321
GET THAT PICTURE OF THE GUY.

1216
01:09:55,263 --> 01:10:01,847
一个叫伯勒斯的小贩子，被冰人雇用
HE'S A SMALL-TIME DEALER. HIS NAME IS...BURROUGHS.

1217
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,900
RECRUITED BY THE ICEMAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

1218
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:07,062
你认识他老板马尔科姆・普莱斯？

1219
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,302
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING

1220
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:08,838
ABOUT THE GUY HE WORKS FOR NAMED MALCOLM PRICE?

1221
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:10,318
我认识他，西部兄弟会

1222
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,140
YEAH, I KNOW HIM. WESTERN BROTHERHOOD.

1223
01:10:10,487 --> 01:10:14,070
如果你要找他们杀人，你得先找普莱斯
WANT THESE GUYS TO DO A HIT FOR YOU,

1224
01:10:14,741 --> 01:10:18,442
- 你有地址码？ - 我不知道，你自己去找吧
YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH PRICE.

1225
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,447
YOU GOT AN ADDRESS?

1226
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:25,619
在环城路的日落汽车旅馆，把电话给雷吉
I'M NOT 411. YOU LOOK IT UP.

1227
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,452
SUNSET MOTEL ON THE BELTWAY.

1228
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:25,989
GIVE THE PHONE BACK TO REGGIE.

1229
01:10:25,794 --> 01:10:31,001
他有什么问题？你能走开吗？ 我有话要和这儿的兄弟说
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

1230
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,092
I DON'T KNOW.

1231
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:32,796
DO YOU MIND? I'M TRYING TO TALK TO THE BROTHER HERE.

1232
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:38,883
能否请你走开？我兄弟要跟我谈黑人的事
I'LL HANDLE THIS. CAN YOU EXCUSE ME?

1233
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:37,967
ME AND MY BROTHER WANT TO TALK.

1234
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:43,007
- 是私事 - 请吧
IT'S BLACK STUFF. EXCUSE US.

1235
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,170
IT'S PRIVATE.

1236
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,706
YOU MIND? YOU MIND?

1237
01:10:43,186 --> 01:10:46,555
你可否去那边？谢谢
HANG ON.

1238
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:46,710
CAN YOU GO OVER THERE?

1239
01:10:46,732 --> 01:10:49,602
- 是私事 - 好吧
THANK YOU.

1240
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:48,512
IT'S PRIVATE.

1241
01:10:49,776 --> 01:10:56,443
听着，我已经给了你要的东西…第二次了
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

1242
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:55,519
REGGIE, LOOK. NOW THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED...

1243
01:10:56,617 --> 01:11:00,697
对，我感激你的忍耐，谢谢
FOR THE SECOND TIME...

1244
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:01,124
YES, YOU HAVE, AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE,

1245
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:04,571
你要…还欠我的债！
AND THANK YOU.

1246
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:06,663
YOU WILL... REPAY YOUR DEBT TO ME!

1247
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:14,755


1248
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:25,890
嘿，哥们，不用担心，我们留了很多后手

1249
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:25,081
HEY, MAN, NOT TO WORRY.

1250
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:27,384
WE GOT LOTS OF BACKUP.

1251
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:29,690
过来喝杯酒
COME ON IN AND HAVE A DRINK.

1252
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,828
[GUNSHOTS]

1253
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:52,834
马尔科姆・普莱斯

1254
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,643
MALCOLM PRICE.

1255
01:11:53,882 --> 01:11:58,877
这肯定是一个好线索，有人向他开了16枪
MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL GOOD LEAD, JACK.

1256
01:11:59,054 --> 01:12:05,721
多年来我一直在查冰人，总是走上死胡同
SOMEBODY SHOT HIM 16 TIMES.

1257
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,652
I'VE BEEN CHASING THIS GOD DAMN ICEMAN FOR YEARS.

1258
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,654
EVERY TIME I GET CLOSE,

1259
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:09,726
- 这工作会让你发疯 - 是啊，是啊…
IT'S ANOTHER GOD DAMN DEAD END.

1260
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,258
THIS JOB WILL DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

1261
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,661
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1262
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:15,893
- 杰克，冰人是一个警察 - 不可能
JACK, THE ICEMAN'S A COP.

1263
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:18,313
把事情联系起来
NO WAY.

1264
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,604
COME ON, JACK. PUT THE SHIT TOGETHER, MAN.

1265
01:12:19,616 --> 01:12:24,574
你查普莱斯的地址，冰人快你一步
JACK, THINK ABOUT IT.

1266
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:24,207
YOU CALLED FOR PRICE'S ADDRESS.

1267
01:12:24,746 --> 01:12:27,866
- 这是巧合，运气不好 - 不是巧合
THE ICEMAN SHOWS UP THERE FIRST.

1268
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,011
IT'S A COINCIDENCE. BAD LUCK.

1269
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:31,291
还有那张图片？
WHAT ABOUT THE BROTHER WHOSE PICTURE YOU'VE BEEN SHOWING AROUND?

1270
01:12:31,461 --> 01:12:35,791
你用电脑系统查面部图片
GET ANY FEEDBACK ON THAT?

1271
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,586
YOU GOT TO RUN A MUG SHOT THROUGH NCIC.

1272
01:12:35,966 --> 01:12:40,509
- 需要多长时间？ - 数小时…有时更慢
HOW LONG THAT TAKE?

1273
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:39,489
HOURS.

1274
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:46,931
知道冰人为什么要杀我？跟钱没有关系
IT'S BEEN HOURS.

1275
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:42,459
WELL, SOMETIMES IT'S SLOW.

1276
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:44,561
THE ICEMAN WANTS TO KILL ME.

1277
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:47,964
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MONEY I TOOK.

1278
01:12:47,102 --> 01:12:52,097
他要杀我是因为我见过他，我可以揭穿他
HE WANT TO KILL ME BECAUSE I SEEN HIM.

1279
01:12:52,274 --> 01:12:58,359
查出谁最努力阻止你查这案子
HE THINKS I CAN BLOW HIS COVER.

1280
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,840
THE SAME GUY IS FUCKING UP YOUR INVESTIGATION.

1281
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,709
WHO'S PUTTING UP RESISTANCE 'CAUSE YOU'RE ON THIS CASE?

1282
01:12:59,072 --> 01:13:01,563
他就很可能是冰人
THAT IS PROBABLY THE ICEMAN.

1283
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:06,617
肯定是威尔逊，那家伙多年来一直针对我
ONLY GUY IT COULD BE IS WILSON,

1284
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:07,751
AND THAT PRICK'S BEEN DOGGING MY ASS FOR YEARS,

1285
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:09,955
从我刚开始查冰人起他便这样
EVER SINCE I STARTED LOOKING FOR THE ICEMAN.

1286
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:13,874
我必须和你到聆讯法庭去辨认这个人
ALL THROUGH THIS THING!

1287
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:14,257
I GOT TO GET YOU TO THE HEARING.

1288
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:19,751
他们可能已经决心把我踢出警察队伍 聆讯两小时前已经开始了
WHAT HEARING?

1289
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:19,663
THE ONE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY MY BADGE.

1290
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:23,342
事后，凯茨探员
IT STARTED TWO HOURS AGO.

1291
01:13:23,513 --> 01:13:28,222
他极力坚持有一名罪犯在背后操纵海湾区
AFTER THE INCIDENT IN THE MISSION DISTRICT,

1292
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:26,903
INSPECTOR CATES DREDGED UP THIS THEORY

1293
01:13:28,393 --> 01:13:32,687
四年来他浪费资源和人力
OF A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND RUNNING THE DRUG TRAFFIC

1294
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:31,240
IN THE BAY AREA.

1295
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,642
FOR FOUR YEARS,

1296
01:13:32,856 --> 01:13:36,272
试图证明他自己和他的理论
HE HAS WASTED DEPARTMENT RESOURCES AND MANPOWER,

1297
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:40,026
描述他的职业操守
RISKED OTHER OFFICERS' LIVES TO VINDICATE HIS THEORIES.

1298
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:41,918
CAN YOU DESCRIBE INSPECTOR CATES' PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE?

1299
01:13:41,156 --> 01:13:46,862
当一名警官为了自己而凌驾部门的纪律之上
WHEN A POLICE OFFICER TAKES IT UPON HIMSELF

1300
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,523
TO VIOLATE DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS

1301
01:13:47,037 --> 01:13:50,287
这就会使好警察也做不好工作
AND SUSPECTS' CIVIL RIGHTS,

1302
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:50,927
IT MAKES IT HARD ON EVERY GOOD COP

1303
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:55,285
反对，这些评论与案件无关
OUT THERE TRYING TO DO HIS JOB.

1304
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,333
THESE REMARKS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INCIDENT.

1305
01:13:55,462 --> 01:13:58,913
我要证明一种行为方式

1306
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,135
ON THE CONTRARY, YOUR HONOR.

1307
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:03,171
它将有助于了解亨特角赛车场所发生的事
I'M TRYING TO SHOW A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR

1308
01:14:03,345 --> 01:14:06,050
证词有效
THAT WILL ILLUMINATE EVENTS AT HUNTER'S POINT RACEWAY.

1309
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,077
I'LL LET THE TESTIMONY STAND.

1310
01:14:27,202 --> 01:14:31,034
根据州政府提供的初步证据
IN CONSIDERATION OF THE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE

1311
01:14:31,206 --> 01:14:37,707
以及遵循加利福尼亚州法律…
PRESENTED THUS FAR BY THE STATE,

1312
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,739
AND IN ADHERENCE TO LAWS, STATUTES, AND RULES

1313
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:37,741
SPECIFIED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

1314
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:43,122
- 就是他！ - 肃静！这是在聆讯
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO--

1315
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:40,476
THERE HE IS!

1316
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,279
ORDER! ORDER! LET'S HAVE SOME ORDER HERE.

1317
01:14:44,052 --> 01:14:46,839
- 不，另有其人 - 不，就在那儿
THIS IS AN OFFICIAL HEARING.

1318
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,216
NO, IT'S SOME OTHER GUY.

1319
01:14:47,014 --> 01:14:49,718
不是他
NO, NO, NO! RIGHT THERE.

1320
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:53,343
- 这些人是谁？ - 法官大人，那就是凯茨探员
THAT'S NOT HIM.

1321
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,688
THAT'S HIM.

1322
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,289
WHO ARE THESE MEN?

1323
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,221
- 肯定不是他 - 他肯定就是冰人
THAT IS INSPECTOR JACK CATES.

1324
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:56,760
THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE GUY.

1325
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:59,855
他不是那个被我取了钱的人
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE ICEMAN.

1326
01:15:00,027 --> 01:15:04,902
- 他肯定就是冰人 - 太过分了！
YOU DON'T FORGET SOMEBODY YOU TOOK HALF A MILLION FROM.

1327
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,734
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE ICEMAN!

1328
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,836
THIS IS TOO MUCH!

1329
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:13,534
本州将会对凯茨探员进行刑事审判
THIS COURT RULES THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

1330
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,942
TO PROCEED WITH A CRIMINAL TRIAL

1331
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:19,911
审判将尽早进行
AGAINST INSPECTOR JACK CATES.

1332
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,546
TRIAL DATE WILL BE SET

1333
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,948
FOR THE EARLIEST OPENING ON THE COURT CALENDAR.

1334
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:20,984
THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED.

1335
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,022
- 冰人干掉了普莱斯 - 你想说什么？

1336
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:45,675
ICEMAN WHACKED OUT PRICE.

1337
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:48,321
他没有选择，你的女友向警察出卖了他
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

1338
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:51,147
NO CHOICE. YOUR GIRL RATTED HIM OUT TO THE COPS.

1339
01:15:50,202 --> 01:15:55,445
这不是瞎说，你们都认识她 她住在金美酒店
BULLSHIT.

1340
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,549
I DON'T BULLSHIT.

1341
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,418
SHE WORKS AS A DANCER,

1342
01:15:55,624 --> 01:15:59,669
你们应该小心与你们所来往的人
LIVES AT THE KING MEI HOTEL.

1343
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:01,658
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH.

1344
01:15:59,836 --> 01:16:04,794
- 谁开的枪？ - 有什么不同吗？

1345
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:03,126
WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER?

1346
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,729
WHAT'S THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER?

1347
01:16:04,967 --> 01:16:09,296
警察险些得手，做事而已，不针对任何人
THE COPS WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE.

1348
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:10,333
THAT'S THE WAY THE MAN DOES BUSINESS.

1349
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:12,425
你应该明白不同之处
BUSINESS, NOT PERSONAL.

1350
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:15,434
做事…对
YOU TWO FUCKING HILLBILLIES

1351
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:14,470
SHOULD LEARN THE DIFFERENCE.

1352
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,140
BUSINESS. YEAH.

1353
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:21,277
AAH!

1354
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:23,770
这也是做事而已
THAT'S BUSINESS, TOO.

1355
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:28,645


1356
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,114
你现在高兴了，混蛋？

1357
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:36,760
YOU HAPPY NOW, ASSHOLE?

1358
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:39,073
这样仍不会改变你要做的事
THAT STILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE JOB.

1359
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:42,999
- 你必须得干掉哈蒙德 - 我们怎么干？

1360
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:43,166
YOU GOT TO KILL REGGIE HAMMOND.

1361
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:48,462
是科克兰德・史密斯保护雷吉在狱中生存
HOW WILL WE DO THAT?

1362
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,070
KIRKLAND SMITH KEPT REGGIE ALIVE

1363
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:49,472
WHEN WE HAD PAPERS OUT ON HIM.

1364
01:16:48,635 --> 01:16:51,755
雷吉欠他的人情，他要偿还
REGGIE OWES HIM. I FIGURED OUT WHERE HE'LL PAY BACK.

1365
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:57,221
这哥们有个女儿在海特・古德威尔商场工作
THE DUDE'S GOT A DAUGHTER

1366
01:16:54,678 --> 01:16:56,079
WORKS IN A GOODWILL STORE

1367
01:16:57,394 --> 01:17:02,898
我们要干掉哈蒙德和那个警察以及冰人
IN THE HAIGHT JUST OFF CENTRAL.

1368
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:00,083
WE'RE GOING TO GET HAMMOND,

1369
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,753
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET THE COP AND THE ICEMAN,

1370
01:17:03,066 --> 01:17:08,108
- 我们要把他们都干掉 - 先集中对付哈蒙德，乡巴佬
AND WE'RE GOING TO KILL THEM ALL.

1371
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:10,126
YOU JUST STICK TO HAMMOND, JOE BOB. THAT'S THE GIG.

1372
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:15,064
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

1373
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:18,491
我总是忘掉开锁密码
I KEEP FORGETTING THE COMBINATION.

1374
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:24,127
我不想看你开锁，我们可以抓到他的
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU CLEAR OUT YOUR LOCKER.

1375
01:17:23,907 --> 01:17:26,109
WE CAN GET THIS GUY.

1376
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:37,050
我当了20年警察
YOU KNOW, REGGIE, I'VE BEEN A COP FOR 20 YEARS,

1377
01:17:37,225 --> 01:17:40,808
整天面对皮条客，杀人犯和劫匪

1378
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:42,525
AND ALL I'VE BEEN AROUND IS PIMPS, MURDERERS, AND ROBBERS,

1379
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:46,934
我对你一向坦率，你尽了力…

1380
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:46,329
BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT.

1381
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,965
NOW, YOU DID YOUR BEST.

1382
01:17:48,528 --> 01:17:52,906
这是你的四十七万五千块

1383
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:54,370
SO HERE'S YOUR 475 THOU.

1384
01:18:03,961 --> 01:18:08,338
你把我的钱放在你的储物柜？警察储物柜，杰克？
YOU KEPT MY MONEY IN YOUR LOCKER?

1385
01:18:08,507 --> 01:18:14,011
耶！嘿，我们没关系了，你自由了，雷吉
YEAH.

1386
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,219
IN A POLICE LOCKER?

1387
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:13,723
YEAH. HEY, WE GOT NO MORE TIES.

1388
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:19,802
我给你的忠告是，把钱拿走然后消失
YOU'RE A FREE MAN, REG.

1389
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:21,197
LISTEN, MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TAKE THIS MONEY AND DISAPPEAR.

1390
01:18:34,825 --> 01:18:38,158
- 你确定吗，哥们？ - 是的

1391
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:38,748
YOU SURE, MAN?

1392
01:18:38,748 --> 01:18:40,216
YEP.

1393
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:43,791
好吧
ALL RIGHT.

1394
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:48,294
好吧

1395
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,725
ALL RIGHT.

1396
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:07,303
谢谢，祝你今天愉快

1397
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:09,245
THANK YOU. HAVE A NICE DAY.

1398
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:19,234
雷吉・哈蒙德，这是七万五 你父亲的意思
HAMMOND. REGGIE HAMMOND.

1399
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:21,124
THIS IS $75,000, COURTESY OF YOUR FATHER.

1400
01:19:19,411 --> 01:19:24,369
- 这钱一定没好来路 - 我们都知道你父亲不是天使

1401
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:23,860
FROM KIRKLAND SMITH? IT'S GOT TO BE DIRTY.

1402
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:28,206
这钱不是偷的 当我在牢里的时候他帮助了我
YOUR FATHER'S NO ANGEL,

1403
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,263
BUT THIS MONEY IS NOT STOLEN.

1404
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,866
YOUR FATHER DID A FAVOR FOR ME.

1405
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:32,503
我欠他的人情，他觉得这会对你有用
I OWED MONEY TO YOUR FATHER.

1406
01:19:32,674 --> 01:19:36,719
许多父亲是不会这样干的，拿着吧，再见
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BENEFIT YOU.

1407
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:37,206
I THINK YOU SHOULD ACCEPT IT.

1408
01:19:38,472 --> 01:19:43,513
哈蒙德先生，他好吗？
BYE-BYE.

1409
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:41,377
MR. HAMMOND.

1410
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:46,437
他很好，你应该去看看他
HOW IS HE?

1411
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:48,417
HE'S GOOD. YOU SHOULD GO SEE HIM.

1412
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:51,766
- 也许吧 - 不，你应该去看看他
MAYBE.

1413
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,890
NO, NO MAYBE. YOU SHOULD GO SEE HIM.

1414
01:19:58,194 --> 01:19:59,295
SHH. SHH.

1415
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:29,135
- 嘿 - 嗨，本

1416
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,425
HEY.

1417
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:37,571
- 抱歉，我不能帮太多的忙 - 你已经尽力了
HI, BEN.

1418
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:35,131
SORRY I COULDN'T HELP MORE, JACK.

1419
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:38,134
IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD.

1420
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:41,488
没有你这里肯定很枯燥
IT'LL BE PRETTY FUCKING DULL

1421
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:42,138
WITHOUT YOU AROUND HERE.

1422
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:44,696
我不敢相信你明天就不来了
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT COMING TO WORK TOMORROW.

1423
01:20:47,332 --> 01:20:50,119
- 来瓶啤酒？ - 等等再说
GET A BEER?

1424
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:51,280
MAYBE LATER.

1425
01:21:03,849 --> 01:21:07,467
- 有许多给你的留言，弗兰克 - 谢谢，乔
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF MESSAGES, FRANK.

1426
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,965
THANKS, JOE.

1427
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,647
- 喂？ - 我们抓到了哈蒙德

1428
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:25,609
- 好，他死了吗？ - 计划有点变动
YEAH.

1429
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:23,379
WE GOT HAMMOND.

1430
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,380
GOOD.

1431
01:21:25,787 --> 01:21:29,536
- 杀了我们一个人不是交易内容 - 这是什么话？
IS HE DEAD YET?

1432
01:21:25,781 --> 01:21:29,752
THERE'S A CHANGE. KILLING ONE OF US WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL.

1433
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:32,495
你想让他死，就给我们五十万
WHAT KIND OF SHIT ARE YOU PULLING?

1434
01:21:32,669 --> 01:21:36,501
为了我们的一个兄弟
500 Gs. THAT'S THE PRICE FOR YOU DOING ONE OF THE BROTHERHOOD.

1435
01:21:36,673 --> 01:21:42,379
五十万或是哈蒙德指证你 在莫德斯托有个地方…
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1436
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,230
500,000, OR WE LET HAMMOND FINGER YOU.

1437
01:21:42,554 --> 01:21:46,386
你要更多的钱，就找个室内场所，人多点的
THERE'S A PLACE OUT OF MODESTO--

1438
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,800
ARE YOU NUTS? NO WAY.

1439
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,203
YOU WANT MORE MONEY, PICK A NEW PLACE.

1440
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:49,638
SOMETHING INDOORS, SOMETHING WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE.

1441
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:59,522
有个叫伯勒斯的家伙好像就是你在找的那人

1442
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,213
JACK, THIS JUST CAME IN.

1443
01:21:57,213 --> 01:22:01,217
SOME GUY NAMED BURROUGHS LOOKS LIKE THE GUY YOU WERE AFTER.

1444
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:02,531
他们在米申找到了他的尸体

1445
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:06,033
这是他的资料，长的不得了
THEY FOUND HIM DEAD IN THE MISSION A WHILE AGO.

1446
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:08,057
HERE'S HIS SHEET. IT'S A MILE LONG.

1447
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:14,165
我曾在这儿传阅这人的照片，一无所获
I CIRCULATED THIS GUY'S PICTURE AT THE PRECINCT LAST NIGHT.

1448
01:22:14,336 --> 01:22:17,621
真好笑，克鲁斯去年七月逮捕了他
I GOT NOTHING.

1449
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:19,668
THAT'S FUNNY. CRUISE BUSTED HIM LAST JULY.

1450
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:47,858
凯茨，虽然我们之间没有感情
CATES, EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN US,

1451
01:22:48,036 --> 01:22:51,239
但我也不希望看到一个男人抛弃了他的事业 过去的就让它过去吧
IT HURTS TO SEE A MAN THROW AWAY HIS CAREER.

1452
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,402
LET'S LET BYGONES BE BY--

1453
01:23:31,288 --> 01:23:35,120
我在找鸟笼俱乐部的高级部分

1454
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:35,878
HEY, I'M LOOKING FOR THE CAGE CLUB.

1455
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:38,495
五楼，你要加入，收五十块
THE UPSTAIRS PART.

1456
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,281
FIFTH FLOOR.

1457
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:41,084
YOU GOT TO JOIN. 50 BUCKS.

1458
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:09,157
你看起来不太高兴，雷吉

1459
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:11,447
YOU DON'T LOOK TOO HAPPY, REG.

1460
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,536
对不起，等会儿我请你喝酒

1461
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,553
SORRY, BABE. I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK LATER.

1462
01:24:26,218 --> 01:24:28,424
哈蒙德呢？

1463
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,698
WHERE'S HAMMOND?

1464
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:34,260
- 那女的是谁？ - 只是碰巧和他在一起的

1465
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,001
WHO'S THE GIRL?

1466
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:35,404
JUST SOMEBODY HE WAS WITH.

1467
01:24:36,895 --> 01:24:44,191
是五十万吧？现在我们开始验货

1468
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:41,410
500 Gs, RIGHT?

1469
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:46,149
NOW, LET'S CHECK THE MERCHANDISE.

1470
01:24:51,076 --> 01:24:56,830
从后门带出去弄死，两个都弄死

1471
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:56,359
TAKE HIM OUT BEHIND THE BUILDING AND BLOW HIM AWAY.

1472
01:24:56,999 --> 01:25:02,159
这人来这儿干什么？那人不是冰人
SHOOT THE GIRL, TOO.

1473
01:24:58,161 --> 01:25:00,163
WHAT'S THIS GUY DOING HERE?

1474
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:03,366
THAT GUY AIN'T THE ICEMAN.

BEN, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

1486

SORRY TO LET YOU DOWN, JACK.

ALL I WANT'S THE ICEMAN.

我没有车，没有钱

现在还被毒贩用微冲指着太阳穴
AND I'LL END THE DAY WITH THIS DOPEMAN'S UZI BY MY TEMPLE.

1527

OH, JACK. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SHOT ME, MAN.

我跟你说过要买件防弹衣的

01:30:46,809 --> 01:30:50,679
YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A DAMN BULLETPROOF VEST.

他不是我朋友，你才是
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO KNOCK YOUR FRIEND.

HE WASN'T MY FRIEND. YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
