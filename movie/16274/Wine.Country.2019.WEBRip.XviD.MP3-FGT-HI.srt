00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,202
So I looked at a bunch of houses
and I think I found the best one.

00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,079
It's perfect.
I'm gonna send you the link.

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,374
And then we should just go ahead
and get it, 'cause it's the best one.

[Rebecca] <i>Abby, the house looks amazing...</i>

6
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,586
and the thought of a trip
is exciting, but...

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,130
turning 50 is so not a big deal to me.

8
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,467
I had a patient this week
who's in knots about turning 40.

9
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,804
The feedback I offered her,
as corny as it sounds is,

10
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,889
"Age is truly just a number."

11
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,267
I mean, you're only as old
as you feel, right?

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,601
Why stress about it?

13
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,395
Oh, fuck, that's hot!

14
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,521
[Catherine] I always love Hawaii.

15
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,856
Oh, you know what?
I catered Jack Johnson's birthday party

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,692
and he said I could use
his beach house there.

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,610
Okay, here are my top picks,
Napa...

18
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,405
a resort in Arizona, or Napa.

19
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,865
Well, all I can say
is thank God you're planning this,

20
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,286
'cause you know Brian
is not gonna do shit for her 50th.

21
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,663
You know Brian would just take her
to Macaroni Grill

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,583
and then she'd have to drive home
because he had too much to drink.

23

Fuckin' Brian.

Oh, my God, this trip sounds so fun.

25
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,213
And it's so great
everyone can get together.

- You're coming, right?
- No.

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,385
Ugh. Mama needs to rock out
with her cock out.

28
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,097
Also, Mama needs to stop
referring to herself in the third person.

29
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,516
And maybe ease up
on the "cock" drops.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,102
I just want this to feel like
a regular vacation.

31
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,730
You know, like,
just sit around, talk, and...

32
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,232
drink wine and laugh
and wear muumuus.

33
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,943
And just somewhere in there,
I'll just kind of slide into 50.

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,154
You know,
I just want it to be super chill...

No, I'm sorry, Rebecca,
but it is officially a big deal.

It's your half-centennial.

I'm just-- Honestly, I'm so grateful

42

after I bailed on the last one.

and that random house, you know,

44
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,721
it just, like, gives me anxiety.

where they show
where all the semen was.

Is a flower in the hair too much
for solo dining?

52

and take my new knees for a spin.

Oh, well, I've been working
a lot less lately.

155
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,709
- Yeah, right.
- Well, good for you.

156
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,962
[Val] We look so young.

157
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,756
God.

158
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,806
Wow.

159
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,689
Let's take a group picture.

160
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,399
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

161
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,360
Yes, yes! Do a pic.

162
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,196
- The night of a thousand selfies?
- Yeah.

163
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,779
Can you go higher?

164
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,157
- Yeah, go higher.
- Try to go higher.

165
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,993
All right, everybody look down
and then on the count of three, look up.

166
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,411
- Fresh faces.
- Fresh face.

167
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,497
[Abby] One, two, three.

168
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,123
- [camera clicks]
- Oh!

169
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,750
[all laughing]

170
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,793
[Rebecca] That's nice.

171
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,752
Wait.

172
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,753
What the...

173
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,296
Is that a ghost?

174
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,923
[Jenny] Oh, my God, it <i>is </i>a ghost.

175
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,218
It's the ghost of Amelia Earhart
and she's holding a small baby.

176
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,595
- What are you guys doing in my house?
- Oh, my God!

177
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,879
Nah, I'm just goofing.

178
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm Tammy, I own the place.

179
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,476
Brought you guys a cord of fresh pinyon,

180
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,811
get you started on a fire.

181
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh. Oh!

182
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,480
Thank you. Uh...

183
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,690
Guys, this is Tammy.

184
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,400
She's the owner of the place. [stammers]

185
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,902
I'm... Abby,
I'm the one that's been emailing you.

186
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,086
A lot of emails.

187
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,238
Yeah.

188
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,656
So, uh...

189
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,242
which one of you guys
is the blushing bride?

190
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,911
Second time around I'm thinking, maybe?
Maybe third?

191
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,228
[chuckling] Oh, no. We're celebrating
Rebecca's birthday.

192
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,374
It's her 50th, the big five-oh.

193
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,835
Celebrating-with-the-girls weekend, huh?

194
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,546
We're just here for a vacation.
The birthday's not a big deal.

195
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,339
So, what am I looking at here?

196
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,259
High school tennis team,
old dance crew, or...

197
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,886
y'all magically fit
in the same pair of pants?

198
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,471
What brings us together?

199
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,473
Oh, well, we all met in Chicago

200
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,393
waitressing at a pizza place
called Antonio's, and...

201
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,437
and we just-- It was meant to be.

202
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,314
Chi-Town, yeah,
I've been to that place, yeah.

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,026
Well, we all came up there together
in the '90s. Kind of our crew.

204
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,988
Actually, um, Catherine here started
her own pizza chain called Cutie Pies.

205
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,489
Holy shit, that's you?

206
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,241
- Yeah.
- I've never been to the restaurant,

207
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,493
but I do love those
frozen pizzas for one that you do.

208
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,477
Thank you.

209
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,788
'Cause, you know,
if I prep a full-size pizza, guess what?

210
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
I'm gonna end up eating a full-size pizza.

211
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,916
So, you know.

212
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,752
You prevent a lot of sadness.

213
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,130
- So, you guys want to see the house or--
- Yes.

214
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,048
All right.

215
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,424
Let's stop dicking around.

216
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,178
You got the pool and the hot tub here
if you wanna soak...

217
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,721
or, uh, toke.

218
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,348
We are very discreet, so just, uh...

219
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,101
do whatever the heck you need to do
to get through this weekend.

220
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,269
Okay. [chuckles]

221
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,521
So, Tammy,
how long have you owned the property?

222
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,689
Uh, a few years.

223
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,983
After my husband died,
I sold our company.

224
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,110
We made edible organic soaps.

225
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,613
Got bought out by Unilever. Pretty sweet.

226
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,865
Sorry your husband died. That's sad.

227
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,868
Yeah, he, uh, died
of a heart attack at 49.

228
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,787
- Oh, wow.
- That's so young.

229
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,040
You think?
It was pretty inevitable, though.

230
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,458
We were doing so much blow.

231
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,919
This'll come in real handy.

232
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:50,381
The little Zen area
when you need that total soul escape.

233
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,344
It's real quiet. It's perfect
for when that roomie situation devolves.

234
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,097
You can just come out here
and watch the hummingbirds,

235
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,683
meditate,
enjoy this beautiful Buddha statue...

236
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,645
Now, this water feature over here,
steer clear, please.

237
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,731
Okay, you wanna know how much money
I poured into this son of a bitch?

238
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,108
- Seven grand.
- [Abby gasps]

239
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,194
Before you suggest it,
no, I cannot just turn it off.

240
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,404
If I do, none of the toilets will work.

241
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,697
Which is ironic

242
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,991
because it's basically a toilet for birds.

243
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,368
And me that one time.

244
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,829
This is the fire pit!

245
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,746
- Ooh.
- Wow.

246
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,997
Light that sucker up,

247
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,167
stare into the flames and contemplate

248
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,711
why in the hell you all came up here
in the first place.

249
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,548
- Also, we have s'mores.
- [laughter]

250
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,676
Hey, Tammy, I'm just having a hard time
getting on the Wi-Fi.

251
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,803
I just have to send
a quick email for work.

252
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,598
Okay, yeah, this is gonna be a rough
weekend if you have to do work stuff.

253
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,309
- The Wi-Fi here is very slow.
- Oh.

254
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,979
So, you're just gonna
have to talk to each other.

255
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,398
- Oh, good.
- While drinking a ton of wine.

256
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,108
What could possibly go wrong?

257
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,319
Just remember, guys,
whatever gets said,

258
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,114
it's probably what the person
has always felt...

259
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,824
and the alcohol just let it out.

260
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,829
You wanna see the view?
It's right through this gate.

261
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,457
Whoa.

262
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,211
Holy triple fucks, this is heaven.

263
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,130
Yeah, well, I didn't work my ass off

264
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,923
to buy a house
on some shitscape property.

265
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,508
- Wow.
- [Jenny] Yeah, that's fake.

266
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,343
There's no way that's real.
It's too pretty.

267
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,388
Ooh. We should sleep out here one night,
under the stars.

268
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,807
You know, like a camping slumber party.
Wouldn't that be fun?

269
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,850
Yes!

270
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,685
Oh, God. Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

271
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,478
I don't know if I want to either.

272
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,689
I have no place
to plug in my CPAP machine.

273
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,940
Things we say now.

274
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,817
[all laughing]

275
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,360
What's everybody laughing at?

276
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,156
Oh, it's just, like, our, you know,
"That's what she said."

277
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,908
You know, "Things we say now."

278
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,075
So, like, uh...

279
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,328
"I gotta go tend my bees.

280
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,746
Things we say now."

281
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,081
I guess.

282
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,792
Well, I say it,
'cause I got a bee farm, so...

283
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,211
Oh, you make honey?

284
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,004
No, I don't make honey.

285
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,339
I get stung a lot.

286
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,301
But you develop, uh, an immunity to it...
and almost a pleasure.

287
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,555
Well, you all obviously have
an entire haunted forest

288
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,390
of toxic jibber-jabber to get through,

289
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,726
- so I'm gonna skedaddle.
- [Val] Bye, Tammy.

290
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,479
[Abby] I have a question about
the cleaning fee when you get a chance.

291
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,480
[Tammy] Love it.

292
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,106
- What else do bees do?
- All right.

293
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,360
Well, guys, you know what,
even if we don't sleep out here,

294
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,696
I love Naomi's idea of just, like,
hanging out, drinking wine,

295
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,990
just talking, connecting...

296
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,283
- Yes, totally.
- Love it.

297
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,078
We are gonna do all of that.
All that is baked into the itinerary.

298
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,580
We're gonna lay around,
we're gonna drink wine,

299
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,290
but first on the docket...

300
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,876
"Unpack and unwind for 20 minutes."

301
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,836
I'm setting a timer.

302
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,090
Psych. But, no. But, I am... Just--

303
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,593
Just take 20 minutes 'cause we have
dinner reservations at 7:15.

304
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,138
[Rebecca] My God, she actually said
"toxic jibber-jabber."

305
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,098
[Naomi] Yes, she did.

306
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,184
[Jenny] God, and what about those bees?
What, does she keep them as pets?

307
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,394
I gotta say something.

308
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,939
I actually really resent it when people,

No, it's not.

[Abby] Oh, uh, yeah, Devon,
can you do me a favor?

- Or I could do it.

The upside down Chariot...

00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,803
Usually, yes, but not when it's sandwiched
between the Snakes and the Rocks.

940
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,681
You see, the fighting snakes show me...

941
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,308
that you all surround yourselves
with battles.

942
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:17,230
People who have been intertwined
and dueling for thousands of years.

943
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,985
You need to help shed the tough skins
that have built up over time,

944
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,028
if you are to remain friends.

945
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,864
A lot of secrets.

946
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,366
Many things unspoken.

947
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,951
And you see the space?

948
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,995
No one's as close as they think.

949
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,497
And you see here with the river stones?

950
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,168
They're gems. They used to be dynamic
and many-faceted.

951
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,379
And they have been worn over time.

952
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,549
And now, they are smooth and dull.

953
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,593
Aged.

954
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,180
From one old lady to another...

Don't wanna fuck up that itinerary.

Sorry, is this any better?

965

Is it any--

Shit-balls! Hello?

968
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,518
- Hello? Shit, fuck--
- Sorry.

969
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,939
Not being nosy, just wanted to bring
some of my hangover cure.

970
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,649
Oh, thanks.

971
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,485
Oh, and some of my edible soaps
for you, too.

972
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,527
Sorry, I...

973
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,365
I know I should be enjoying myself
and not stressing about work.

974
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,116
Hey, I'm not judging.

975
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,871
Owning and managing five properties
has its share of shit-fuck days for sure.

976
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,458
[chuckling] But I bet you get to meet
a lot of interesting people, so...

977
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,418
No.

978
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,878
No, you'd be surprised.

979
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,505
People are all the same.

980
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,925
I go whole days without speaking.

981
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,137
Better get to the wine tasting, so...

982
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,058
- A little advice for today.
- Oh?

983
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,395
If you, or anyone around you
starts a sentence with,

984
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,563
"Can I just say something?"
stop right there.

985
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,983
[laughs] Okay. I will keep that in mind.
Thank you.

986
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,234
Try the juice.

987
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,577
It's got kind of a garbage flavor,
but the soap helps with the aftertaste.

988
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,789
- Edible?
- Seventy percent.

989
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,839
I can still taste the soap a little bit.

990
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,842
It's just in your head.
It's 'cause of the shape.

991
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,553
Now, as you can see,
this little beauty is quite spacious

992
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,639
and does come with
4x4 off-road capability.

993
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,058
So if you see some beautiful spot
and you say to yourself,

994
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,227
"I'd like to get up close and personal
with that vista,

995
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,522
but the terrain is clearly a no-go."
Think again. I got you.

996
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,107
Yeah, we got it, man.

997

No, you know, I'm not ashamed to say.
Actually, I'm turning 50 tomorrow.

- Yeah!

1008

Great, yeah. You say it, sister!

1009

Okay, can we go?

[Devon] So, ladies, a little early history
of the Napa Valley.

1020
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,708
The first official winery and vineyard
was established by one Mr. John Patchett,

1021
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,628
who began planting grape vines in 1854--

1022
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,880
So, Val, did that cute waitress
text you back?

1023
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,925
- Ooh. Is there romance in the air?
- Devon, don't listen to our conversation.

1024

[Val] No, but she's probably
still sleeping.

That picture she took of you is gorgeous.

1026

- Mm-hmm. Thanks.
- What picture?

1027
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,600
Oh, it's on the shared photo site we have.

1028
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,227
You probably didn't accept the invite.

No, I didn't get one.

1030

Will you send me an invite? I'll accept.

1031

Probably just the Wi-Fi.

Yeah, but... you know.

1092
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,063
Peaches. There is no peaches in there.

1093
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,982
- Okay.
- What else you got?

1094
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,110
- Oh, lemon.
- Yes, very good.

1095
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,569
I taste the lemon, yeah.

1096
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,071
You don't taste it, you smell it.

1097
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,364
Grapes!

1098
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,491
Well, yeah. Of course.

1099
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,827
Nice. That's smart!
Definitely grapes in there.

1100
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,203
Can't go wrong with that.

1101
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:34,000
- Jasmine.
- No, that's... that's egregious.

Pinot-gregious.

Oh, we lost Mason.

So is it like <i>The Catherine Stewart Show,</i>

1107
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,970
or is it like I'm one of three judges,
you know what I mean?

1108
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,306
'Cause that's sort of significant
in terms of what...

1109
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,433
I'm talking about.

1110
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,018
You know what I mean?

1111
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,770
Right, if it's <i>Catherine Stewart</i>
<i>of Cutie Pies</i>

1112
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,648
or <i>Cutie Pies Featuring</i>
<i>Catherine Stewart</i> and like--

1113
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,192
Can you hold on one second?
Something's going on in front on me.

1114
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,862
What are you doing?
My God, give me my phone back.

1115
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,740
- That's an important phone call.
- My face is an important phone call.

1116
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,075
I'm not giving you
your precious phone back...

1117
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,911
until you start flossing.

1118
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:11,996
Come on.

1119
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,039
All right, fine.

1120
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,708
Do it. Do it. Do it!

1121
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,085
Okay. Oh, my God, I'm nailing this.
I'm really good at this.

1122
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:21,172
- She'll call you back, she's flossing.
- I gotta floss more when I'm day-drunk.

00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,923
[Val] <i>Here's the last thing I sent to her.</i>

1124
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:26,719
"I have vintage jade earrings at my store.
Would love to send them to you."

1125
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,304
So dumb.

1126
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,473
She's <i>Jade.</i>

1127
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,100
You know she's got, like,
a million jade things.

1128
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,477
I made a mistake.

1129
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,394
[sighs]

1130
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,896
She's too young for me.

1131
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,397
Val.

1132
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,108
May I offer you some feedback?

1133
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,485
Go for it.

1134
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:46,781
Okay, I mean, when it comes to age,
the number itself truly doesn't matter.

1135
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,823
It's, I mean...

1136
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,576
I wish Abby could understand this,
'cause she's coming at me like,

1137
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,994
"You're 50! You're 50! You're 50!"

1138
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,080
It's like, what matters is
how you feel inside.

1139
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,164
So...

1140
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,752
with all that in mind,
what would you say your soul's age is?

1141
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,837
I'd say, like, 12.

1142
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:06,342
I mean, maybe a little older.
Probably old enough to drink... and bone.

1143
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,095
Maybe 18... 18 and a half.

1144
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,722
Almost out of the house.

1145
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,266
Don't have my own car yet.

1146
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,185
But I have a bike.

1147
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,436
Mmm.

1148
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,814
Oh. This one's good.
What's it called again?

1149
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,108
- White wine.
- [scoffs] Frickin' love it.

1150
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,776
So, can I just say something?

1151
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,279
Rebecca is in complete denial
that this is her birthday weekend.

1152
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,907
You know, as usual,
she's glossing over everything.

1153
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,451
There are so many things
she doesn't deal with.

1154
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,579
- Hello? Brian.
- Ugh. Fuckin' Brian.

1155
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,124
She's gotta be having feelings
about turning 50.

1156
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,917
Where does she put it all?

1157
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,295
"This is just another trip,
it's not a big deal." It's like...

1158
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,922
Hello? Get into it!

1159
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
God, you know how hard it is,
by the way...

1160
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,803
to make 10,000 reservations
for 400 people

1161
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,472
at 55 million different locations?

1162
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,390
Oh, I know.

1163
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,685
Abby, you've done such a good job
at planning this. You should know that.

1164
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,687
Thanks.

1165
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,356
It's probably 'cause
it's my full-time job now.

1166
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,108
Wait, what?

1167
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,236
- This is good, right?
- Oh, yeah.

1168
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,199
[Abby] Chug-a-lug, ladies!
We're on the move!

1169
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,619
Oh, no, ladies. That is a select cabernet,
meant to be savored...

1170
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,080
Yeah, we can get this stuff online.
Let's hit the van.

1171
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,751
[Rebecca] Jeez, this is a real
go-go-go kinda trip.

1172
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:23,878
Keep up, Fifty.

1173
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,297
My soul age is 28.

1174
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,341
[Mason] I'd love to get your names
and socials for our wine club.

1175
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,386
Okay, guys, next stop
is biking and shopping.

1176
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,305
- Yes!
- And we're gonna get all our stuff in Napa

1177
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,223
so we don't have to get anything
at the airport.

1178
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,641
I'm gonna buy a really big hat.

1179
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,643
Ooh! Naomi, you're up.
What's your DUI song?

1180
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:44,398
My song is gonna be,
"Poison, Po-Po-Po-Poison."

1181
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,357

1393
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,721
how long does it stay in your body?

1394
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,639
Like, what is the duration of the "trip?"

1395
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,142
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God, the quotes.

1396
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,394
Whatever we do,
we have to harmonize in here

1397
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,688
- 'cause the acoustics are the shit.
- Oh, yes.

1399
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,449
[Abby] Hey, guys!

1400
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,616
Can we put our T-shirts on,

1401
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,870
so we can get to the pavilion
and take a super-fun drone shot?

1402
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:07,544
You guys, I'm gonna go follow her
and I'm gonna go offer some feedback.

1403
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,796
- I actually think that's a terrible idea.
- Don't do it.

1404
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,882
- Please don't.
- No, this is what I do.

1405
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,508
Where is she?

1406
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,304
Yeah, how does she know her way
around these tunnels?

[both sigh]

1416
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,643
Hey, Abby, the girls urged me
not to offer you any feedback,

1417
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,603
but I'm just gonna go with my gut here.

1418
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,271
May I offer you some feedback?

1419
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,523
Oh, boy.

1420
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,527
I feel like the universe
is gently nudging you to chill.

1421
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,946
Well, tell the universe that I'm chilling,

1422
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,365
and I'm also looking for the drone.
Do you see it?

1423
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,534
Okay, just, the schedule you have us on,

1424
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,869
I feel like it's keeping <i>you</i>
from having fun.

1425
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:26,623
Like, if you were just to let go,
everything will just fall into place.

1426
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,209
Will it fall into place?

1427
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,962
Will it, Rebecca? Will it fall into place?

1428
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,589
Will someone else take care of me?

1429
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,758
Or will I always have to do
everything myself?

1430
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,052
Let me know when it falls into place,

1431
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,930
'cause last time I checked,
this world's pretty fucking selfish.

1432
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,640
Okay. Deep breath. [inhales]

1433
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,560
No, let's take some inventory
about how everything's falling into place.

1434
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,645
How about my marriage?
Did that fall into place?

1435
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,231
What about those texts from that girl
that's gonna hurt you?

1436
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,399
That falling into place?

1437
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,194
Your obvious midlife crisis.
Is that falling into place?

1438
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,948
Your inability to cope
with almost anything...

1439
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,075
- is that falling into place for you?
- No.

1440
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,244
What about your husband?
Is that falling into place?

1441
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,162
What?

1442
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,581
Maybe you should take
a good hard look at yourself.

1443
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,249
Maybe the therapist should go to therapy.

1444
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,796
Am I not getting a falling into place?

1445
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,840
- [Naomi] Catherine, enough.
- [sighs]

1446
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,093
The whole "left out" thing
is really getting old.

1447
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,054
You're the one who's always running away
from us every time you get a call.

1448
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,348
- I have work.
- I'm sorry, let's not fight.

1449
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,185
This time together
is supposed to be special.

1450
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,687
Oh, my God, Naomi, we're not fighting,
we're just talking.

1451
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,857
- That's what life is.
- Well, it's very negative.

1452
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,026
Yeah, life is negative,
that's what Brené Brown said.

1453
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,111
That's exactly what she did <i>not </i>say.

1454
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,363
Abby, what is negative in your life,
right now?

1455
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,657
Okay, you've got amazing friends,
you got a great career--

1456
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:43,992
No, I don't.

1457
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,785
[tearfully] Okay? I lost my job.

1458
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,789
All right? And it's really stupid
to even cry about it.

1459
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,587
Shit, I mean, people are starving
in the world and there's earthquakes.

1460
01:01:56,087 --> 01:02:00,008
And people are shooting at each other,
I'm crying about my stupid poor job.

1461
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,178
Oh, Abby, honey. That doesn't mean
your feelings aren't valid.

1462
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,096
That's exactly what white privilege is!

1463
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,682
Plus, what are we doing
to the environment?

1464
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,768
I mean, we can't--
There's no fish anymore!

1465
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,438
All the plastic is...
filling up in the ocean.

1466

And... [sobs]
There's like one rhinoceros left!

1467
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,362
What the fuck?

1468
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,201
Why wouldn't she tell us that?

1469
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,122
[sighs] Some things are too scary to say.

1470
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,415
Not to us.

1471
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,543
You guys don't like Brian?

1472
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,213
- Oh, my God, We love Brian.
- Brian?

1473
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,090
- Just-- He's a character.
- He's the best.

1474
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,549
- So cool.
- Fuckin' prince.

1475
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:42,467
Awesome.

1476
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,474
Where to?

1477
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,892
[Rebecca] Oh, um...

1478
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,603
Well, Abby, what's--
what's on the itinerary?

1479
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:56,314
You know what? Don't look at that,
it doesn't matter. It's stupid.

1480
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:05,031
Do you think throwing the itineraries
out of the window was on the itinerary?

1481
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,533
[Jenny] Guess we'll never know.

1482
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,494

I gotta make a decision.

Oh, my God, she texted.

01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,917
Jade just texted back.

She wants us to come over to her art show.

Aww.

1488
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,048
[chuckles] I told you.

1489
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,135

- Okay, let's go there, then.

01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,387
Let's go to the art show, right?
That'll be perfect.

This wall of shoe boxes
should really snap her out of her mood.

I'll tell you the answer.

"No," and "No, you're not."

Abby, I know you don't want
to talk about it,

Yeah, so, uh...

Art has been my <i>raison d'être </i>since...

literally my first moment
of consciousness.

1514

Um, I can't believe I'm following
in the footsteps of my heroes...

like, from the city

in the caravans and all of...
it's fucking so touching.

So, thank you.

1524
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,543
Uh... so, yeah.
Let me, uh, get on with it.

1525
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:25,130
<i>The Nanny</i> was more than a sitcom.

1526
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,217
Okay, it was a postmodern psychodrama

1527
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,845
about classism and ambition in the 1990s.

1528
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:37,517
You know, Fran Drescher's Fran Fine
was an icon, honestly.

1529
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,270
I-- I mean, a cultural touchstone.

1530
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,896
[crowd applauding]

1531
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,983
God. All her art is Fran Drescher.

1532
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:47,277
Why?

1533
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,573
Uh, yeah, so yeah, I'd like to just
open up for some questions or comments.

1534
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,490
Yeah?

1535
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:56,828
It's so contextual, but at the same time,
wholly independent.

1536
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:58,830
Did you do that consciously?

1537
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,748
Uh, you know what, I did. Yeah.

1538
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:04,169
Uh, it's really a<i> lettera d'amore</i>
to <i>The Nanny.</i>

1539
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:07,839
But, more importantly, it's a reaction
to all of our experiences

1540
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,382
surrounding <i>The Nanny.</i>

1541
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:10,717
I never saw <i>The Nanny,</i>

1542
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,095
but I don't want that to stop me
from participating in this conversation.

1543
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,054
It shouldn't.

1544
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,766
Um, this piece...
Am I supposed to feel scared?

1545
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,686
Yes. I am so glad you got that vibe.

1546
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,898
- Also offended. Yeah?
- Very. Thank you.

1547
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,317
Have you considered doing
any other sitcom art?

1548
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,236
- Like, is <i>ALF </i>an option?
- That's a good question.

1549
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:32,947
Uh, I think I'm focusing more on women
right now.

1550
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:36,576
'Cause, I don't know, I feel like
time is up on <i>ALF, </i>right?

1551
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,161
I-- I have a question. Um...

1552
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:41,498
Do any of you watch TV?
Like, is TV still a thing?

1553
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,875
Like, do you watch those
judging competition shows?

1554
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,752
I've only seen TV in the movies.

1555
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,504
- [sighs]
- [Catherine] I knew I was right.

1556
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,047
Damn it. Gotta call my agent.

1557
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,301
Adrian, comma, confirming I was correct

1558
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:57,138
re, colon, streaming V, period, broadcast.

1559
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,182
Shit, I don't have a signal,
I gotta go outside.

1560
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:04,187
Yeah, my oldest kid is 15
and on the verge of becoming...

1561
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,064
this.

1562
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,441
I just want to know, how do I stop her

1563
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,068
from becoming an asshole?

1564
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,654
I feel like I'm about to take umbrage.

1565
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,197
Are you okay?

1566
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,032
[Naomi]
And you know what else worries me?

1567
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,284
It is way too easy for you guys
to get porn.

1568
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:19,577
Oh, my God.

1569
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,497
I used to drive miles
in the middle of the night

1570
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,124
just to go to this little newsstand
by the bus station

1571
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,960
just to find lesbo porn.

1572
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,879
You guys have it so lucky
on the porn front.

1573
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:31,839
I hadn't thought about it
that way before.

1574
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,424
It's so interesting.

1575
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,386
Mm-hmm. No wonder
they're so scared of sexuality.

1576
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,387
[murmurs of assent]

1577
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,430
They associate it with hard work and fear.

1578
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,224
- And driving long distances.
- Mmm.

1579
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,101
I can't with the confidence
in these people.

1580
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:46,729
Wait. So we're putting 'em down
because they have healthy self-esteem?

1581
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,315
I've spent my whole life thinking I suck.

1582
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,609
You know what happened
at my first poetry reading?

1583
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,902
I completely bombed.

1584
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,947
No claps. No snaps. Just total silence.

1585
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,449
Until finally this one dude,
way in the back,

1586
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,493
he just turned to his girlfriend
and he went,

1587
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:01,619
"Oof."

1588
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,706
But you know what?
That was an important oof,

1589
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,042
because it confirmed to me
that I'm a complete piece of shit,

1590
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,503
and that's what made me
the writer I am today.

1591
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,463
I thank God for that oof.

1592
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,633
- This girl needs an oof.
- Oof.

1593
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:19,304
Jade, we're not trying
to hurt anyone's feelings.

1594
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,180
My God, they were born with hurt feelings.

1595
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:25,018
Why do you not blast your feelings
all over your best friend, the internet?

1596
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,811
Please, their parents
are their best friends.

1597
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,146
Well, that I do like.

1598
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:30,523
You know who my best friend is?
My best friend.

1599
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,693
These women, right here,
who I have known for 20-plus years.

1600
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,863
And, yeah, sure, sometimes
I want to tell this one to fuck off.

1601
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,656
That's what intimacy looks like.

1602
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,491
- You want me to fuck off?
- What?

1603
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,994
If you all are friends,
why are you so mad at each other?

1604
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,412
[Abby] We're not mad!

1605
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,539
- Crazy, mad, grouchy. Look at this one.
- Fascinating.

1606
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,708
We're not grouchy.

1607
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,293
Guys, please forgive us.

1608
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,045
We've been drinking wine all day,

1609
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,422
and we're just not right in our heads
right now.

1610
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:58,092
We are exactly where we need to be.
We're doing fine...

1611
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,637
Fran Fine.

1612
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,805
[all gasping]

1613
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,891
- [applause]
- That's brilliant. Did you see that?

1614
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,392
Is this part of the show?

1615
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,937
That was... incredible.

1616
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,607
You are amazing. Moms, you're amazing.

1617
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,151
[woman] I mean it.

1618
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,821
[Jade] Context within context, like,
it's exactly what we're talking about.

1619
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,131
Excuse me. Do you have Wi-Fi in here?

1620
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,175
And then there was one.

1621
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,302
Tammy, hi.

1622
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,597
I'm just trying to get a little work done
while the girls are at this art show.

1623
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:45,682
- Art show?
- Yeah.

1624
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,809
Oof, things must have gone
really sideways.

1625
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,103
Here. Give me your phone.
I'll get you online.

1626
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,938
Oh, my God. Awesome, thank you.

1627
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,817
Pedro, is the password still
"penis_grigio72"?

1628
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,318
[chuckling]

1629
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,322
Thank you.
We need a couple of beers here also.

1630
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:02,949
Ooh. Cool.

1631
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,118
Are you guys good pals?

1632
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:07,412
We are acquaintances.

1633
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,329
Ah.

1634
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,750
Do you ever get lonely up here,
living by yourself?

1635
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,963
No, I love it. Loneliness is for suckers.

1636
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,298
'Cause you know who I can trust? Me.

1637
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,676
You know, who's never gonna bail on me?

1638
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,593
Me.

1639
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,220
Anyway, get your shit done,

1640
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,681
bring people joy
with that fantastic pizza.

1641
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,558
I'll be over here hitting bull's-eyes.

1642
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,396
Hey, Tammy, can I ask your advice
on something?

1643
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,313
Shoot.

1644
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,942
- I'm being offered this TV show--
- No, shoot the dart.

1645
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,778
I'm uncomfortable in any one-on-one
situation unless I can win.

1646
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:41,696
Oh.

1647
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,408
Sure. Right, okay.

1648
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,952
Thanks, Val.

1649
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,872
Do you think you can carry
this one over, too?

1650
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:51,956
You got it.

1651
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,917
- Okay, just be very careful.
- Oh, of course.

1652
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,043
Okay.

1653
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,963
Oh, that smile is so infectious.

1654
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,132
I know, it's so ironic, right?

1655
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,262
Sorry about my friends.

1656
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,765
Oh, no! I love them.

1657
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,435
People are really liking my show.

1658
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,938
Do you think you guys could come back
and do that whole...

1659
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,982
"I'm mad at young people" thing again?

1660
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:22,445
I can ask. But to be clear,
we're not mad at young people.

1661
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,739
Or I'd be mad at myself, right?

1662
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,577
- You're so funny, Val.
- Aw.

1663
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,204
I'm happy we met.

1664
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:32,580
Me, too.

1665
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,666
I like you.

1666
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,379
I like you, too.

1667
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,805
Can I ask you something?

1668
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,227
[sighs]

1669
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,230
I think I know what it is.

1670
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,863
I usually charge $800, but...

1671
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,282
I'm gonna give it to you for $600.

1672
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,666
Talking about the painting?

1673
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,878
[Jade chuckles]

1674
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,380
That's great.

1675
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,967
'Cause I love your art so much.

1676
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,427
- It's gonna look great.
- I can't wait to hang it.

1677
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,679
Ah. So happy.

1678
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:38,312
As a business owner, you can't join in
in the same way.

1679
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,358
You know, you can't worry
about if people like you or not.

1680
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:44,819
Yeah, I mean, I...

1681
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:46,612
Oh, shit.

1682
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,323
I get that with my employees,

1683
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,285
but we're talking about
my oldest friends, I mean...

1684
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,829
of course I'm gonna worry
about what they think.

1685
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,330
That's where you're fucking up.

1686
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,124
Why?

1687
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,628
Because I don't think your friends
even invited you on this trip.

1688
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,255
Did Abby tell you that?

1689
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,340
Did she say five people were coming?

1690
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:07,258
What? No.

1691
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,303
I'm saying is work
is a big part of who you are.

1692
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,722
So if they don't let you talk about work,

1693
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,391
then they're not letting you
be on this trip.

1694
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,518
Yeah, okay. Can I just say something?

1695
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,353
No. Ah-ah. Remember what I said?

1696
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,314
About the phrase
"Can I just say something?"

1697
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,816
- Just walk away from that phrase.
- Fuck, right.

01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:25,943
[sighs]

1699
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,905
When I was a kid,

1700
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,657
I was always alone, you know?

1701
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:35,786
My mom was a single working mother,
that whole deal, right?

1702
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,040
And it really wasn't until I met
these girls that I...

1703
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,709
experienced family.

1704
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:43,836
That's powerful.

1705
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,838
Friendship is powerful.

1706
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,718
You gotta do that show.

1707
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:54,889
Stay busy, pizza for one,
be honest with yourself,

1708
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,015
work is your best friend,

1709
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,726
and you gotta get contestants
on that show that are kids,

1710
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,770
because I love watching
kids with knives.

1711
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,066
Yeah.

1712
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,036
This weekend is a mess.

1713
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,665
I can't even plan a fun birthday trip.

1714
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,542
[Devon] Can I quote one of my favorite
song lyrics?

1715
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:28,506
"Self-doubt is self-worth
in another universe."

1716
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,134
What song is that?

1717
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:33,636
My own.

1718
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:35,972
Of course.

1719
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,350
Is the paella ready yet?

1720
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,519
Just about.
Maybe another four hours or so.

1721
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:42,561
Oh, Jesus.

1722
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,773
- How are you gonna get that thing home?
- [Val] I don't know. I'll fuckin' fold it!

1723
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,483
You know what?

1724
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,237
Today was <i>not </i>an amazing day
in wine country.

1725
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:53,823
So suck on that.

1726
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:55,783
Hm.

1727
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:03,290
- [man] <i>So how is it? Are you having fun?</i>
- This trip is three nights too long.

1728
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:07,211
<i>But the trip is only three nights.
Oh. I get it.</i>

1729
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,631
Wish I was there.

1730
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,051

[thuds]

1740
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,103
My back.

1741
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,397
[groaning]

1742
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:10,858
Oh, no.

1743
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,527
Oh, my God, no.

1744
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:14,779
No.

1745
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,739
Guys? Guys!

1746
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,534
[knocking]

1747
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,078
Hey.

1748
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,496
So, quick update,

1749
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,582
the paella is still simmering, it's gonna
take a little longer than I thought.

1750
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,000
Whatever, Devon.

1751
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,845
Any chance we could have sex?

1752
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:06,872
Fine.

1753
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:15,798
Morning, sunshine.

1754
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:20,427
I'd love to stick around and snuggle,
but the paella is probably peaking.

1755
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,720
Devon, get the fuck out.

1756
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,055
To be continued.

1757
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:28,561
Rebecca?

1758
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:29,645
[gasps]

1759
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,231
What's going on?
Are you okay? Did you pass out?

1760
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,733
No, I'm not okay.

1761
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:37,403
- I threw my back out.
- Oh, no.

1762
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:40,239
- Okay, let me call Tammy.
- No, Naomi, shut up, shut it.

1763
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,116
- Just help me up here.
- You got it.

1764
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,326
- Okay, just get me up.
- Okay, you got it.

1765
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,704
- Ready? One, two, three...
- No problem.

1766
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,622
[groans]

1767
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:49,582
Oh!

1768
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,376
Oh, honey. Are you okay?

1769
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,378
I was lying here all night.

1770
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,380
And I realized...

1771
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,549
Abby was right about me.

1772
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,677
I did need to take
a good hard look in the mirror,

1773
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,180
or in this case, the door.

1774
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,473
And as I was lying here,

1775
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,934
I saw every truth about myself.

1776
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,394
Soon...

1777
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,771
a trio of raccoons joined me.

1778
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,481
Right there.

1779
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:16,400
Yeah.

1780
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,069
I locked eyes with the dad.

1781
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,365
Once you've looked in the eye
of a raccoon,

1782
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,659
you know your truth.

1783
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,746
How did you know he was the dad?

1784
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,165
He was just the leader, I could tell.

1785
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,083
You didn't, like, look at--

1786
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,587
They were all with me, though.
They stayed here. It was amazing.

1787
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,506
- You saw a family of raccoons?
- Yes.

1788
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,508
And you communicated--

1789
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,802
I connected with them
more than anyone this whole weekend.

1790
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,680
Honey, did you take that molly?

1791
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,016
They helped me see what I really am.

1792
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,810
- An old lady.
- What?

1793
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,688
Yes, it's true. I'm old, 50.

1794
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,607
- That's half a fucking century.
- Listen.

1795
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,903
We are all getting older and
maybe our bodies aren't working--

1796
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,947
Fuck feedback,
I don't want any feedback right now.

1797
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,615
- Okay.
- I need to make some big changes.

1798
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,242
Number one.

1799
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,744
I'm in a shitty marriage.

1800
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:13,374
Brian is a world-class ding-dong.

1801
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:16,919
Thank God.

1802
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,338
Brian sucks.

1803
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:20,339
[gasps]

1804
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,716
Hey, what's going on in here?

1805
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,011
Rebecca threw her back out
and Brian sucks.

1806
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,471
What? No.

1807
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,973
Val, she knows.

1808
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,558
- Oh, thank God.
- [Abby] We don't like him.

1809
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,978
- [Jenny] Such an asshole.
- I'm done lying to myself.

1810
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,021
I'm ready to tell like it is.

1811
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,815
It's just like Lady Sunshine said.

1812
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,567
It's later than we think, so--

1813
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:41,694
[moans]

1814
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,821
Okay. Get me up off this floor.

1815
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:48,409
'Cause we are gonna do everything
on that goddamn itinerary

1816

and we are gonna do it now!

1817
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,788
This is really good news, 'cause
I have planned some exciting things.

1818
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:55,291
Where's Catherine?
Has anyone seen her this morning?

1819
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:59,044
Oh, my God, did she leave early
to do that stupid-ass cooking show?

1820
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,505
Unbelievable, she full-on bailed
on Rebecca's birthday.

1821
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:05,134
- Oh, happy birthday by the way.
- [all] Happy birthday!

1822
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,094
- Load me up!
- Okay.

1823

Let's go! Go! Move! Move! Move! Move!

Ooh. Get me out of this bathrobe, though.

Hey. Good news.

01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,899
Two hours and counting on the paella.

1828
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,902
Oh, how in God's name
is that paella not ready?

1829
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,113
I got a little sidetracked last night.

1830
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,239
Stop.

1831
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,117
[Rebecca] Okay, you know what? It's fine.
We don't even want the paella.

1832
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,744
No, I can't wait to taste it, Devon.

1833
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,163
No, no, let's not bullshit him.
We don't want the paella.

1834
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,957
Life is too short to wait for the paella!

Ladies, we are gonna grab this day
by the motherfucking balls.

1836
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:44,965
I'm gonna get this wheely chair
onto this senior van

1837
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:48,344
- and I'm going to my birthday brunch!
- Yeah! All right, let's do it!

01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:54,978
Wait!

2004
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,606
- Wait!
- What's going on?

2005
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,442
- What was that?
- Val fell down the hill.

2006
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:04,070
- I'm going.
- What? You're going?

2007
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:05,447
[Rebecca] Wait, Jenny's going?

2008
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,741
[panting] Someone's gotta help her.

2009
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,534
Why don't we just go back
the way we came in?

2010
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,787
No, hell no. There's snakes back there.

2011
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,664
- No, Jenny!
- What's happening?

2012
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,750
- [Catherine] Jenny? Jenny?
- Jenny, no!

2013
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:17,667
Jenny!

2014
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:18,710
[Jenny whoops]

2015
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:21,254
[Abby] Jenny? Oh, my God!
How is she not falling?

2016
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,798
[Naomi] Yeah, Jenny!

2017
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,801
Wow. Did she ski as a kid?

2018
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,928
[Jenny] Whoo!

2019
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,638
Man, she's keeping that wine safe.

2020
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,015
[both cheering]

2021
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,351
I'm not gonna die
of a poisonous snake bite

2022
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:35,685
on the top of this hill.

2023
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,188
Not today, Satan. I got this.

2024
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,314
What?

2025
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,818
- I'm goin'!
- Okay, now Naomi's going!

2026
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,655
Roll me out of this cart!
I need to go down the hill!

2027
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,825
What about your back?

2028
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,953
- You know what, it's my birthday. Ah!
- Oh, God.

2029
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,915
And I'm not going to lay here
and watch the fucking clouds go by.

2030
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,793
Now, get me off this cart!

2031
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,419
- Whoa!
- Hold on.

2032
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,339
- [Val] Naomi, you can do it!
- There's wine down here!

2033
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,799
[Rebecca] Go, go, go!

2034
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,802
[yelling]

2035
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,762
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, cripes.

2036
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:15,433
- No, no, no...
- Jump!

2037
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,102
- [Catherine] Naomi!
- [both grunt]

2038
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,103
[Naomi] Fuck.

2039
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:19,479
[grunts]

2040
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,107
Is everybody okay?

2041
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,650
[panting]

2042
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,068
Oh, my God.

2043
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,654
That fixed my back!

2044
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,198
- [Rebecca laughs]
- [Naomi] Oh, God.

2045
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,449
[Naomi groans]

2046
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,536
I'm gonna take the easy way.

2047
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,039
- Really, that was crazy.
- [Rebecca] We did it.

2048
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,165
Oh, my God.

2049
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,376
Easy, easy.

2050
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,377
Whoa.

2051
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,422
Just get to the bush
and you're fine from there!

2052
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:46,631
That's what she said.

2053
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,049
[squealing]

2054
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:50,343
[whimpering]

2055
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:51,344
[panting]

2056
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:54,055
Just let go! We're here for you!

2057
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:55,432
You got this, Abby.

2058
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:58,268
- I'm gonna let go.
- [Rebecca] You can do it!

2059
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,811
[screaming]

2060
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:02,355
You're braving the wilderness, Abby!

2061
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:05,025
[grunting, yelling]

2062
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,402
- [Naomi] Whoo!
- [Rebecca] You got it!

2063
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,237
Of course I'm the last one left.

2064
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:10,363
[cell phone ringing]

2065
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,616
- [Jenny] Oh, my God!
- [Abby] That was fun!

2066
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,784
Hello? Oh, hi!

2067
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,037
Oh, hey, hi! The whole team's there.
Hi, guys!

2068
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,164
- [Abby] Cath, come on!
- Yeah!

2069
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,332
Great. Go ahead.

2070
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:23,001
Are you kidding me? She's taking a call?

2071
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:24,544
Okay.

2072
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:28,381
So you're saying that you think
I'd be stupid to pass on this offer.

2073
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,636
Well, I'm gonna be stupid. I'm gonna pass.

2074
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:36,431
You know what, life is just going by me
faster than I thought it would,

2075
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,100
and I'm tired of chasing
the next big thing.

2076
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,519
It's kept me from living in the present.

2077
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,689
Okay, I'm gonna hang up
before I change my mind.

2078
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:53,031
In case you're wondering,
I said no to the job.

2079
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,492
- What is she saying?
- We can't hear you!

2080
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,370
I wanna be able to go on vacation,
you know?

2081
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,455
[faintly] Go to weddings...

2082
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,375
[indistinctly yelling]

2083
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,336
I'm so sorry, we can't hear you.

2084
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,005
But here's the thing
you do have to know about me.

2085
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:10,632
I love working.

2086
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,384
I do. I love it.

2087
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,595
But I'm gonna come down there.

2088
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,306
I'm coming down now...

2089
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,475
because I choose you.

2090
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:22,811
- [Val] Should we nod?
- I can't hear a word.

2091
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,062
[Jenny] I didn't get one word.

2092
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,649
Adrian, comma, send ambulance
to Sacred Moon Winery, period.

2093
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:30,235
Friend bitten by snake, exclamation point,
question mark.

2094
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,195
Snake emoji. Send.

2095
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:39,077
Whoa!

2096
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,705
[yelling]

2097
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,337
Swan dive maybe wasn't the best idea.

2098
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,214
Gonna feel that one tomorrow.

2099
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:56,553
But it was glorious.

2100
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:58,513
Thanks.

2101
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,266
[sighing]

2102
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,436
Okay, so the snake wasn't venomous.

2103
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,273
We treated it with
some antibacterial cream and...

2104
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,066
you're all good.

2105
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:14,571
Wh-- Whoa. I'm definitely not all good.

2106
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,906
Little condescending.

2107
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:20,994
So, we almost died on that hill
because of a non-venomous snake?

2108
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,705
You know, honestly, I think
it might have been a sharp twig.

2109
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,958
Sometimes those catch you
at the wrong angle.

2110
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,335
Uh, no, it was a snake, we saw a snake.

2111
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:31,046
[Naomi] Also, I'm a grown woman.

2112
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:34,215
I think I know when I've been bit
by a snake.

2113
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,093
Let me guess, Dr. Dick-swing.
It's because of her period.

2114
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,179
This is the problem
with the medical establishment.

2115
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,638
- Nobody listens to women.
- Right.

2116
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:43,516
This is why more women die
of heart attacks, right here.

2117
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,852
[Naomi] Also, I don't appreciate it

2118
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,938
when you grin at me
while giving me my results.

2119
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,398
'Cause I could have died.

2120
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:55,153
When I get home,
and if there <i>is </i>venom in my ankle,

2121
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,948
I'm gonna come back here
and make sure you personally suck it out.

2122
01:32:59,032 --> 01:32:59,991
- Yeah.
- Suck it.

2123
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,368
I'm not... entirely sure
what's happening here.

2124
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,996
- Thank you, that'll be all.
- Okay, thank you.

2125
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:09,042
Also, tell your mom to pick you up
after your shift, Doogie!

2126
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,503
- [Naomi] Fuckin' dickweed.
- Wow.

2127
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,505
So should we, um...

2128
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,299
head on back to the house?

2129
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:20,428
We need to make a call.

2130
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,185
[Siri chimes]

2131
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:28,895
Call Doctor...

2132
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:31,314
Melton.

2133
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,818
[Catherine] Call Dr. Melton.

2134
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,070
[line ringing]

2135
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,530
[woman] <i>Hello, Dr. Melton's office.</i>

2136
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,406
Hi, this is Naomi Reid.

2137
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,034
I'm calling for the results
of my BRCA test.

2138
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:46,663
<i>Yes, let me get the results for you.
Let me put you on a brief hold, okay?</i>

2139
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:48,039
Yeah.

2140
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:50,667
That was a really good Naomi.

2141
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:57,423
No matter what this news is,
we got you, okay?

2142
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,179
<i>Hi, Mrs. Reid?</i>

2143
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:05,807
<i>Hi, yes, your blood work
came back negative.</i>

2144
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,768
Thank you. Thank you.

2145
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:09,894
[sighing]

2146
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,481
[Catherine] Thank you so much.

2147
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:16,192
And what were the, uh,
results of my fart test?

2148
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:18,153
[all laughing]

2149
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:21,531
I don't have it.

2150
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:23,825
Hey, Janiece.

2151
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:26,995
How's your son? Still on the chess team?

2152
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:29,956
- Oh, yeah, big nerd.
- It's the only way to raise 'em.

2153
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,167
Hey! Tammy's here!

2154
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,169
How'd you know where we were at?

2155
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:37,547
Well, I heard on the scanner that
six middle-aged ladies went to the ER.

2156
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,007
Figured it had to be you guys.

2157
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,634
