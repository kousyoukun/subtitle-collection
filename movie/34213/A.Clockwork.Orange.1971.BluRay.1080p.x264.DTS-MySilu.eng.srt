1
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,370
There was me.

2
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,570
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.

3
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,480
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

4
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,580
And we sat in the
Korova Milk Bar...

5
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,480
...trying to make up
our rassoodocks...

6
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,950
... what to do with the evening.

7
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,750
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

8
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,620
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...

9
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,860
... which is what we were drinking.

10
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,830
This would sharpen you up...

11
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,940
...and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

12
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,150
In Dublin 's fair city

13
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,710
Where the girls are so pretty

14
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,050
I first set my eyes

15
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,420
On sweet Molly Malone

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,590
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,130
Through streets broad and narrow

18
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,630
Crying cockles

19
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,030
And mussels....

20
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,570
One thing I could never stand...

21
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,270
... was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie...

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,210
...howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers...

23
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,780
...and going "blerp blerp "
in between...

24
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,250
...as it might be a filthy, old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

25
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,120
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

26
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,490
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

27
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,130
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

28
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,440
Go on ! Do me in,
you bastard cowards!

29
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,480
I don't want to live anyway.

30
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,480
Not in a stinking world like this.

31
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,490
And what's so stinking about it?

32
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,960
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

33
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,360
It stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old. . .

34
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,630
. . .Like you done!

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,710
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

36
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,680
What kind of a world is it at all?

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,850
Men on the moon .

38
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,570
Men spinning around the earth .

39
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,080
And there's not no
attention paid. . .

40
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,550
. . .to earthly
law and order no more.

41
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,590
Oh dear land

42
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,300
I fought for thee

43
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,370
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...

44
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,630
...and his four droogs.

45
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,430
They were about to perform
a little of the old...

46
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,600
...in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

47
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,750
Well, if it isn't. . .

48
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,630
. . .fat, stinking. . .

49
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,130
. . .Billy goat Billy-boy in poison .

50
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,600
How are thou . . .

51
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,610
. . .thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

52
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,010
Come and get one in the yarbles. . .

53
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,180
. . .if you have any yarbles. . .

54
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,350
. . .you eunuch jelly, thou .

55
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,450
Let's get them, boys!

56
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,850
The police!

57
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,150
Come on . Let's go!

58
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,640
The Durango 95 purred away
real horrorshow.

59
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,180
A nice warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

60
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,620
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers...

61
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,410
... with real country dark.

62
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,420
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night...

63
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,000
...playing Hogs of the Road.

64
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,220
Then we headed west.

65
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,170
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

66
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,630
That was a real kick...

67
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,400
...and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

68
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,380
Who on earth could that be?

69
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,930
I'll go and see.

70
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,480
Yes, who is it?

71
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,710
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

72
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,120
My friend's bleeding to death !
Can I please use your telephone?

73
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,590
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

74
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,530
But, missus, it's a matter
of life and death !

75
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,100
Who is it, dear?

76
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,900
A young man .
He says there's been an accident.

77
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,800
He wants to use the telephone.

78
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,240
I suppose you better let him in .

79
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,140
Wait a minute, will you?

80
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,580
I' m sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in--

81
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,600
What do you want from me?

82
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,070
Right, Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim.

83
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,210
I'm singing in the rain

84
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,150
Just singing in the rain

85
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,750
What a glorious feeling

86
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,210
I'm happy again

87
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,420
I'm laughing at clouds

88
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,920
So dark up above

89
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,920
The sun's in my heart

90
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,200
And I'm ready for love

91
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,070
Let the stormy clouds chase

92
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,840
Everyone from the place

93
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,540
Come on with the rain

94
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,600
I've a smile on my face

95
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,640
I'll walk down the lane

96
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,620
With a happy refrain

97
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,550
And I'm singing

98
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,660
Just singing...

99
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,020
...in the rain

100
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,300
Viddy well, little brother.

101
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,190
Viddy well .

102
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,390
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...

103
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,290
...it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.

104
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,860
So we got rid of the auto...

105
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,460
...and stopped at the Korova
for a nightcap.

106
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,200
Hello, Lucy.

107
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,070
Had a busy night?

108
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,180
We've been working hard too.

109
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,380
Pardon me, Luce.

110
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,620
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...

111
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,060
...laughing and govoreeting.

112
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,890
The devotchka smeched away...

113
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,630
...not caring about
the wicked world one bit.

114
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,740
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

115
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,270
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...

116
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,640
...she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

117
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,890
And it was, like, for a moment,
my brothers...

118
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,350
...some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

119
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,890
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...

120
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,990
...standing endwise.

121
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,360
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...

122
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,190
...and then down again.

123
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,130
Because I knew what she sang.

124
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,810
It was a bit from
the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van.

125
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,750
What did you do that for?

126
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,080
For being a bastard
with no manners.

127
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,090
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise.

128
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,160
I don't like you should
do what you done.

129
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,070
And I' m not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

130
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,910
Watch that.

131
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,310
Do watch that. . .

132
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,110
. . .if to continue to be on live
thou dost wish .

133
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,780
Yarbles!

134
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,250
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you !

135
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,390
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

136
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,250
I' m not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

137
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,600
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

138
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,700
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

139
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,310
Doobidoob.

140
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,560
A bit tired maybe.

141
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,490
Best not to say more.

142
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,330
Bedways is rightways now .

143
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,000
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

144
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,700
Right, right?

145
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,550
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...

146
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,120
...in municipal flat block
18-A Linear North.

147
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,070
It had been a wonderful evening.

148
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,840
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...

149
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,020
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

150
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,970
Oh, bliss!

151
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,130
Bliss and heaven!

152
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,170
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

153
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,040
It was like a bird
of rarest spun, heaven metal.

154
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,780
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...

155
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,790
...gravity all nonsense now.

156
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,790
As I slooshied...

157
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,020
...l knew such lovely pictures.

158
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,110
Alex. Alex!

159
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,790
What do you want?

160
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,620
It's past 8 :00, Alex.

161
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,920
You don't want to be
late for school, son .

162
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,060
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

163
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,830
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

164
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,800
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

165
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,910
But you've not been
to school all week, son .

166
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,270
Got to rest, Mum.

167
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,610
Got to get fit.

168
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,610
Otherwise I' m liable
to miss a lot more school .

169
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,150
I'll put your breakfast
in the oven .

170
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,420
I've got to be off meself now .

171
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,720
All right, Mum.

172
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,230
Have a nice day at the factory.

173
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,700
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

174
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,770
Yes. Yes, I heard.

175
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,730
You know what time he got in?

176
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,970
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

177
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,140
I wonder. . .

178
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,650
. . .where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

179
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,250
Like he says. . .

180
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,790
. . .it's mostly odd things he does.

181
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,220
Helping-like. . .

182
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,060
. . .here and there as it might be.

183
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,730
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

184
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,970
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

185
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,670
Alex-boy.

186
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,040
Awake at last, yes?

187
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,740
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

188
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,010
She gave me the key.

189
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,050
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

190
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,230
Hence not at school, yes?

191
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,730
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

192
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,090
It should be clear
by this afterlunch .

193
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,600
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

194
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,040
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

195
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,870
-Cup of the old chai, sir?
-No time, no time, yes.

196
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,670
Sit, sit, sit!

197
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,980
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

198
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,950
Anything wrong, sir?

199
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,020
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

200
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,620
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

201
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,190
Just a manner of speech .

202
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,450
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your. . .

203
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,000
. . .post-corrective advisor to you,
that you watch out, little Alex.

204
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,800
Because next time it's not going to
be the corrective school .

205
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,310
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

206
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,370
If you've no respect
for yourself. . .

207
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,710
. . .you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you .

208
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,080
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

209
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,550
A confession of failure
for every one of you . . .

210
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,690
. . .who ends up in the stripy hole.

211
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,790
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

212
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,620
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

213
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,160
Sir, I mean .

214
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,990
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

215
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,470
Just because the police
haven't picked you up. . .

216
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,900
. . .doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

217
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,170
There was a bit
of nastiness last night.

218
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,280
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

219
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,750
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

220
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,380
Your name was mentioned.

221
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,850
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

222
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,960
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

223
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,390
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual .

224
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,260
I' m warning you, little Alex. . .

225
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,690
. . .being a good friend
to you as always. . .

226
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,730
. . .the one man in this
sore and sick community. . .

227
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,670
. . .who wants to save you
from yourself!

228
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,790
What gets into you all?

229
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,360
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

230
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,720
But we get no farther
with our studies.

231
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,420
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

232
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,870
You've got not too bad of a brain .

233
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,230
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

234
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,370
Nobody's got anything on me.

235
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,410
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

236
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,270
That's just what worries me.

237
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,180
A bit too long to be safe.

238
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,250
You' re about due, by my reckoning.

239
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,780
That's why I' m warning you . . .

240
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,550
. . .to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

241
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,120
Do I make myself clear?

242
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,820
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

243
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,400
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

244
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,930
You can rely on me, sir.

245
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,460
Excuse me, brother.

246
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,330
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

247
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,000
Just a minute.

248
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,030
Pardon me, ladies.

249
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

250
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,180
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

251
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,460
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

252
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,060
Who you getting, bratty?

253
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,160
Goggly Gogol?

254
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,460
Johnny Zhivago?

255
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,570
The Heaven 1 7?

256
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,740
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

257
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,240
I bet you've got little say,
pitiful, portable picnic players.

258
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,640
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

259
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,910
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

260
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,180
You are invited.

261
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,570
Hi, hi, hi, there.

262
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,800
Well, hello.

263
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,410
He are here!

264
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,700
He have arrived!

265
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,000
Hooray!

266
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,980
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well .

267
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,480
To what do I owe
the extreme pleasure. . .

268
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,420
. . .of this surprising visit?

269
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,460
We got worried.

270
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,200
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko. . .

271
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,000
. . .and you had not turned up.

272
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,630
And we thought
you might have been, like. . .

273
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,240
. . .offended by something
or other.

274
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,840
So around we come to your abode.

275
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,480
Appy polly loggies.

276
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,920
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

277
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,990
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

278
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,660
Sorry about the pain .

279
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,890
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

280
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,490
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

281
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,270
You sure the pain is gone?

282
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,870
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

283
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,600
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

284
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,540
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such . . .

285
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,510
. . .does not become you,
my little brothers.

286
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,880
As I am your droog and leader. . .

287
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,550
. . .I' m entitled to know
what goes on .

288
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,680
Now then, Dim.

289
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,050
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

290
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,760
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

291
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,470
That's part of the new way.

292
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,540
New way?

293
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,140
What's this about a new way?

294
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,350
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

295
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,590
If you must have it,
have it, then .

296
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,050
We go around shop crasting
and the like. . .

297
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,820
. . .coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each .

298
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,500
And Will the English
in the coffee mesto. . .

299
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,400
. . .saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

300
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,500
The shiny stuff. The lce!

301
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,800
The big, big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

302
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,210
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

303
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,410
Have you not everything you need?

304
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,590
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

305
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,810
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

306
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,660
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

307
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,090
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

308
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,370
Good! Real horrorshow !

309
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,940
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

310
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,630
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

311
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,450
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

312
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,980
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

313
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,520
Something to sharpen us up.

314
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,690
You especially.
We have the start.

315
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,670
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...

316
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,140
...l was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

317
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,980
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...

318
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,670
...saying what we should do
and what not to do.

319
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,820
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

320
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,720
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...

321
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,020
...and that the oomny ones
used, like...

322
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,160
...inspiration and what Bog sends.

323
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,400
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

324
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,730
There was a window open
with a stereo on...

325
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,340
...and I viddied right at once
what to do.

326
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,440
I had not cut into any
of Dim 's main cables.

327
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,980
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...

328
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,550
...the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.

329
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,480
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...

330
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,420
...down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.

331
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,850
Now they knew who was
master and leader.

332
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,330
Sheep, thought l.

333
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,760
But a real leader knows
always when, like...

334
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,200
...to give and show generous
to his unders.

335
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,110
Now we' re back to where we were.

336
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,110
Yes?

337
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,740
Just like before, and all forgotten?

338
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,640
Right, right, right?

339
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,010
Right.

340
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,010
Right.

341
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,520
Right.

342
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,090
Well, Georgie-boy. . .

343
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,260
. . .this idea of yours for tonight.

344
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,370
Tell us all about it, then .

345
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,160
Not tonight.

346
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,030
Not this nochy.

347
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,200
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

348
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,140
You' re a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all .

349
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,650
We' re not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

350
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,980
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

351
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,730
It's this health farm.

352
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,860
A bit out of the town.

353
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,840
Isolated.

354
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,770
It's owned by this rich ptitsa...

355
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,070
... who lives there with her cats.

356
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,910
The place is shut down
for a week...

357
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,080
...and she's completely on her own.

358
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,150
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver...

359
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,290
...and, like, jewels.

360
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,950
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.

361
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,820
Tell me more.

362
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,330
Oh, shit!

363
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,550
Who's there?

364
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,110
Excuse me, can you please help?

365
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,920
There's been a terrible accident!

366
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,060
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

367
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,060
I' m frightfully sorry.

368
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,590
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

369
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,630
I suggest you use that.

370
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,900
But missus, this is an emergency!

371
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,940
It's a matter of life and death !

372
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,980
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death !

373
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,350
I' m very sorry. . .

374
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,580
. . .but I never open the door
to strangers after dark.

375
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,050
Very well, madam.

376
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,680
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious. . .

377
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,760
. . .with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

378
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,590
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then .

379
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,230
I' m sorry if I disturbed you .

380
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,700
Thank you very much .

381
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,560
Good night.

382
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,610
Dim, bend down .

383
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,880
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

384
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,340
Hello. Radlett Police Station?

385
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,410
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

386
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,410
I' m sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

387
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,520
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know .

388
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,830
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

389
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,330
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

390
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,020
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

391
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,140
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning. . .

392
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,600
. . .in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assaulted.

393
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,900
Just a few minutes ago.

394
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,010
If you think that's necessary.

395
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,910
But I' m quite sure
he's gone away now .

396
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,250
All right, fine.

397
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,350
Thank you very much .

398
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,560
Hi, hi, hi there.

399
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,130
At last we meet.

400
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,030
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not satisfactory.

401
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,600
Who are you?

402
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,800
How the hell did you get in here?

403
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,050
What the bloody hell
do you think you' re doing?

404
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,890
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

405
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,750
You filthy old soomaka.

406
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,590
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

407
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,230
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in .

408
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,030
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

409
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,640
It's a very important work of art.

410
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,880
What the bloody hell do you want?

411
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,190
To be perfectly honest, madam. . .

412
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,720
. . .I' m taking part in an
international students' contest. . .

413
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,800
. . .to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

414
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,130
Cut the shit, sonny. . .

415
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,900
. . .and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

416
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,270
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here. . .

417
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,380
. . .before I throw you out!

418
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,710
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

419
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,910
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

420
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,180
Fucking. . .

421
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,380
. . .Little. . .

422
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,480
. . .bastard!

423
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,130
-Let's go! The police are coming!
-One minoota, droogie.

424
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,360
You bastards!

425
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,660
I' m blind!

426
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,930
I' m blind, you bastards!

427
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,940
I can't see!

428
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,990
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

429
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:49,560
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

430
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,430
I know the law, you bastards.

431
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,000
Righty-right, Tom.

432
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,380
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

433
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,310
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

434
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,800
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

435
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,740
Shame, isn't it?

436
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,630
Spoils all your beauty.

437
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,340
Who gave you that, then?

438
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,480
How'd you do that, then?

439
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,150
What's your point, you bastard?

440
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,580
That is for your lady victim.

441
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,090
You ghastly. . .

442
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,090
. . .wretched scoundrel .

443
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,590
Get him off me!

444
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,660
You rotten little bastard!

445
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,270
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

446
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,170
Good evening, Sergeant.

447
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,540
They' re in room B, sir.

448
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,340
Thank you very much .

449
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,580
Sergeant--

450
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,770
Good evening.

451
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,480
Good evening, inspector.

452
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,660
-Would you like your tea now, sir?
-No, thank you, Sergeant.

453
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,850
May I have some
paper towels, please?

454
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,430
We' re interrogating
the prisoner now .

455
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,220
-Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
-Thank you very much .

456
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,790
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all .

457
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,000
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

458
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,110
Just look at the state of him.

459
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,330
Loves young nightmare-like.

460
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,480
Violence makes violence.

461
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,670
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

462
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,520
This is the end of the line for me.

463
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,920
The end of the line, yes.

464
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,720
And what of me, brother sir?

465
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,660
Speak up for me.
I' m not so bad.

466
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,850
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

467
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,930
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

468
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,470
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

469
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,540
It was all their idea, brothers.

470
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,470
They forced me to do it.
I' m innocent!

471
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,950
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

472
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,950
A murderer.

473
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,780
Not true, sir.

474
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,820
It was only a slight tolchok.

475
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,520
She were breathing, I swear it.

476
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,290
I've just come from the hospital .

477
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,760
Your victim has died.

478
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,230
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

479
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,430
This is some new form of torture.

480
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,970
-Say it, brother sir.
-It will be your own torture.

481
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,010
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

482
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,980
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

483
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,980
We'll hold him down .

484
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,850
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

485
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,980
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...

486
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,450
...O, my brothers and only friends.

487
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,180
After a trial
with judges and a jury...

488
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,700
...and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...

489
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,060
...he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F...

490
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,800
...among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

491
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,910
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...

492
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,480
...against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

493
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,950
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief. ..

494
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,590
...at her only child
and son of her bosom...

495
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:07,450
...like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.

496
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,680

I have been informed. . .

595
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,250
. . .in visions. . .

596

. . .hotter than any flame
of human fire. . .

. . .of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves--

601
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,470
Don't you laugh, damn you !

602
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,550
Don't you laugh .

603
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,780
I say, like yourselves. . .

604
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,550
. . .scream. . .

605
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,690
. . .in endless and
unendurable agony.

606
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,860
Their skin . . .

607
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,590
. . .rotting and peeling.

608
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,600
A fireball . . .

609
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,200
. . .spinning in their
screaming guts!

610
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,840
I know . Yes, I know !

611
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,170
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258 . . .

612
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,710
. . .in the prisoner's hymnal .

613
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,150
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

614
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,050
I was a wandering sheep

615
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,820
-Sing up, damn you !
-I did not love the fold

616
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,460
Louder!

617
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,130
I did not love my shepherd's voice

618
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:06,240
I would not be controlled

619
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,070
Never!

620
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,610
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

621
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,750
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

622
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,120
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...

623
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,380
...and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...

624
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,150
...ready to dribble all over...

625
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,300
...a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

626
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,830
It was my rabbit...

627
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,840
...to help the prison charlie
with the Sunda y service.

628
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,140
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

629
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,440
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...

630
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,080
...and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

631
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:15,080
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

632
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,180
And I could viddy myself
helping in...

633
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,370
...and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

634
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,920
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

635
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,390
I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book...

636
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,760
... which is more like
all preachy talking...

637
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,230
...than fighting
and the old in-out.

638
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,570
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...

639
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,040
...and then drink
their Hebrew vino...

640
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,510
...and getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.

641
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,770
That kept me going.

642
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,020
"Seek not to be like evil men .

643
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,580
Neither desire to be with them. . .

644
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,920
. . .because their minds
studieth robberies. . .

645
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,060
. . .and their lips speak deceits. "

646
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,820
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress. . .

647
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,360
. . .thy strength
shall be diminished.

648
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,300
Fine, my son . Fine.

649
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,730
Father?

650
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,570
I have tried, have I not?

651
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,900
You have, my son .

652
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,480
-I've done my best, have I not?
-Indeed.

653
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,140
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have l?

654
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:06,680
You certainly have not, 65532 1 .
You've been very helpful .

655
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,820
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

656
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,360
Father. . .

657
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:15,560
. . .can I ask you
a question in private?

658
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,170
Certainly, my son . Certainly.

659
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,870
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

660
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,280
Don't be shy to speak up.

661
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,120
Remember. . .

662
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,350
. . .I know . . .

663
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,430
. . .of the urges that can
trouble young men . . .

664
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,190
. . .deprived. . .

665
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,420
. . .of the society of women .

666
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,630
It's nothing like that, Father.

667
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,780
It's about this new thing
they' re all talking about.

668
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,010
About this new treatment.

669
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,580
It gets you out of prison in no time.

670
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,410
And makes sure you
never get back in again .

671
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,450
Where did you hear about this?

672
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:17,350
Who's been talking
about these things?

673
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,130
These things get around.

674
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,590
Two warders talk, as it might be.

675
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,860
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

676
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,840
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops. . .

677
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,630
. . .and the newspaper
tells all about it.

678
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,110
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

679
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,040
I take it. . .

680
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,650
. . .you are referring. . .

681
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,080
. . .to the Ludovico technique.

682
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,190
I don't know what it's called.

683
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,330
I just know it
gets you out quickly. . .

684
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,090
. . .and makes sure you
never get back in again .

685
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,630
That is not proven, 65532 1 .

686
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:03,030
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

687
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,300
It has been used, hasn't it?

688
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:09,270
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

689
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,970
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

690
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,950
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

691
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,790
I don't care about the dangers.

692
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,590
I just want to be good.

693
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,590
I want for the rest
of my life to be. . .

694
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,890
. . .one act of goodness.

695
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,620
The question is. . .

696
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,800
. . .whether or not this technique. . .

697
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,670
. . .really makes a man good.

698
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,840
Goodness comes from within .

699
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,170
Goodness. . .

700
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,810
. . .is chosen .

701
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,310
When a man cannot choose. . .

702
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,640
. . .he ceases to be a man .

703
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,390
I don't understand. . .

704
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:55,350
. . .about the whys and wherefores.

705
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:59,530
I only know I want to be good.

706
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,560
Be patient, my son .

707
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,060
Put your trust in the Lord.

708
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:11,560
Instruct Thy son
and he shall refresh Thee. . .

709
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:14,670
. . .and shall give delight
to Thy soul .

710
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,570
Amen .

711
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,200
-Mister!
-All present and correct, sir!

712
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,430
Right!

713
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,070
All present and correct, sir!

714
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,190
Prisoners, halt!

715
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,360
Now pay attention !

716
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,870
I want you in two lines. . .

717
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,770
. . .up against that wall,
facing this way.

718
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,540
Go on, move!

719
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,040
Hurry up!

720
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,610
Stop talking!

721
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,010
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

722
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,170
How many to a cell?

723
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,270
Four in this block, sir.

724
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,410
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

725
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:34,880
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

726
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,780
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

727
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,820
Not a chance, my dear fellow .

728
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,420
The government can't be
concerned any longer. . .

729
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,390
. . .with outmoded penalogical theories.

730
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:49,220
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

731
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:53,030
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

732
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,030
I Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all .

733
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,430
Full implementation
in a year's time.

734
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,970
Punishment means nothing to them.

735
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,110
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

736
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,540
You' re absolutely right, sir.

737
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,380
Shut your bleeding hole!

738
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,540
Who said that?

739
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,590
I did, sir.

740
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:20,590
What crime did you commit?

741
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,920
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

742
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,900
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

743
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,730
Fourteen years, sir.

744
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,200
Excellent.

745
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,930
He's enterprising. . .

746
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,230
. . .aggressive. . .

747
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,640
. . .outgoing. . .

748
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,780
. . .young. . .

749
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,240
. . .bold. . .

750
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,980
. . .vicious.

751
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,570
He'll do.

752
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,940
Fine.

753
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,740
We could still look at C-block.

754
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:47,010
No, no. That's enough .
He's perfect.

755
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,990
I want his records sent to me.

756
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,520
This vicious young hoodlum. . .

757
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,720
. . .will be transformed
out of all recognition .

758
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,950
Thank you very much
for this chance.

759
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,930
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

760
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,760
-Shall we go to my office?
-Thank you .

761
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,840
Come in .

762
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,480
Sir!

763
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,650
65532 1 . Sir!

764
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:14,840
Very good, Chief.

765
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,640
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

766
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:19,380
Full name and number
to the governor.

767
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,450
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
65532 1 , sir.

768
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,260
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

769
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,130
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the interior.

770
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,430
The new Minister of the interior.

771
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,540
What they call a very new broom.

772
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:43,270
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

773
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,780
And orders are orders.

774
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,610
Though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

775
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,050
An eye for an eye, I say.

776
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,280
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

777
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:59,220
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans. . .

778
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:01,260
. . .not hit back also?

779
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,150
The new view is to say "no. "

780
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,800
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

781
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,900
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

782
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,860
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

783
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,570
You are to be reformed.

784
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,940
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

785
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,810
You will be leaving here.

786
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:26,250
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

787
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,220
It's believed you'll be able. . .

788
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,480
. . .to leave state custody
in a fortnight.

789
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,590
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

790
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,660
Answer the governor's question !

791
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,230
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much .

792
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,830
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

793
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,300
I' m very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

794
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,940
Sign this where it's marked.

795
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:51,170
Don't read it, sign it!

796
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:55,140
It says you' re willing to have
your sentence commuted. . .

797
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:58,380
. . .to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

798
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,920
And this.

799
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,690
And another copy.

800
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,070
The next morning I was taken to...

801
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,970
...the Ludovico medical facility...

802
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,110
...outside the town center.

803
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,810
I felt a malenky bit sad...

804
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,990
...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...

805
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:34,550
...as you will when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

806
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,520
Right, hold the prisoner.

807
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,660
Good morning, sir.
I' m Chief Officer Barnes.

808
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,730
I've got 65532 1 . . .

809
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:50,630
. . .on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

810
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,600
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you .

811
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,070
I' m Dr. Alcot.

812
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,280
Dr. Alcot.

813
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,910
Very good, sir.

814
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,820
-Are you prepared for the prisoner?
-Yes, of course.

815
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,980
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

816
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,330
There, sir.

817
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,210
And there, sir.

818
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,240
And there.

819
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,690
There you are.

820
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,860
Prison escort, move forward!

821
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,100
Halt!

822
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,910
Excuse me, sir.

823
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,720
Is that the officer that is
to take charge of the prisoner?

824
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:28,830
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

825
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,630
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again . . .

826
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,040
. . .in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

827
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,980
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

828
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,950
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

829
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,220
-Morning, Charlie.
-Good morning, Doctor.

830
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,520
Good morning, Alex.

831
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:59,390
My name is Dr. Branom.
I' m Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

832
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,260
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

833
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:02,770
Indeed, it is.

834
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,530
May I take that?

835
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,930
-How are you feeling?
-Fine, fine.

836
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:14,140
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky. . .

837
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:15,650
. . .and begin your treatment.

838
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,780
You' re a very lucky boy
to have been chosen .

839
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:23,180
I realize that,
and I' m very grateful .

840
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,750
We' re going to be friends,
aren't we?

841
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,260
I hope so, missus.

842
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,870
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

843
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,360
Nothing of the sort.

844
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,530
-Vitamins, will it be, then?
-Something like that.

845
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,440
You' re undernourished.

846
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,040
So after each meal
we'll give you a shot.

847
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,770
Roll over on your right side.

848
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:46,810
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down .

849
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,720
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

850
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,660
It's quite simple, really.

851
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,100
We' re going to show you some films.

852
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,670
You mean, like
going to the pictures?

853
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,630
Something like that.

854
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,770
That's good.

855
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,770
I like to viddy
the old films now and again .

856
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,280
And viddy films I would.

857
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,750
Where I was taken to, brothers...

858
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:23,140
... was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

859
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,680
I was bound up
in a straitjacket...

860
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,190
...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...

861
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,690
... with wires running away from it.

862
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:33,260
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...

863
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,950
...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

864
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,960
It seemed a bit crazy to me...

865
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,100
...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

866
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,700
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...

867
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:49,370
...l would put up with much
in the meantime, my brothers.

868
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:18,140
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...

869
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,310
...like it was done in Hollywood.

870
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,700
The sounds were real horrorshow.

871
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:26,070
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

872
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,610
You could even get
the breathing and panting...

873
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:31,840
...of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

874
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:34,020
And then what do you know?

875
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,350
Soon our dear old friend...

876
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,580
...the red, red vino on tap...

877
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:39,990
...the same in all places...

878
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,720
...like it's put out
by the same firm...

879
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,860
...began to flow.

880
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:46,260
It was beautiful.

881
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,000
It's funny how the colors
of the real world...

882
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,200
...only seem really real...

883
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,640
... when you viddy them
on a screen.

884
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,070
Now, all the time
I was watching this...

885
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,510
...l was beginning
to get very aware...

886
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,950
...of, like, not feeling
all that well.

887
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:08,110
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

888
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,690
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...

889
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:15,620
... which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...

890
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:18,730
... who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...

891
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:21,730
...first by one malchick...

892
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:23,700
...then another.

893
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,300
Then another.

894
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,710
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...

895
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,440
...leering and smecking
and then going into it...

896
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:38,920
...l began to feel really sick.

897
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:42,050
But I could not shut me glazzies.

898
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,710
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...

899
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,990
...l still could not get out of. ..

900
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,860
...the line of fire
of this picture.

901
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,190
Get me up.

902
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:57,370
I' m going to be sick.

903
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,400
Get something for me to be sick in !

904
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,610
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject. . .

905
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:10,110
. . .to experience
a deathlike paralysis. . .

906
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,150
. . .together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

907
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,820
One of our early test subjects. . . .

908
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,890
. . .described it as being like death .

909
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,990
A sense of stifling or drowning.

910
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,460
And it is during this period,
we have found. . .

911
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:29,330
. . .the subject will make
his most rewarding associations. . .

912
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:33,340
. . .between his catastrophic
experience, environment. . .

913
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,910
. . .and the violence he sees.

914
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,440
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you .

915
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,050
You've made
a very positive response.

916
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:48,050
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon .

917
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:51,280
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

918
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:54,760
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

919
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,330
But we have to be hard on you .
You have to be cured.

920
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,590
It was horrible.

921
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,430
Of course it was horrible.

922
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,130
Violence is a very horrible thing.

923
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,070
That's what you' re learning now .

924
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,570
Your body's learning it.

925
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,010
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

926
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,480
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

927
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,620
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow .

928
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:22,040
You felt ill this afternoon
because you' re getting better.

929
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:25,420
When we' re healthy,
we respond to the hateful . . .

930
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,720
. . .with fear and nausea.

931
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:30,090
You' re becoming healthy,
that's all .

932
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,490
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still .

933
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,180
It was the next day, brothers...

934
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,980
...and I had truly done my best...

935
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,710
...morning and afternoon
to play it their way...

936
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,720
...and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick...

937
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,450
...in the chair of torture...

938
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,960
... while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...

939
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,840
...though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

940
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,500
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness...

941
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:54,640
... what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

942
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,040
It was Ludwig van.

943
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:59,880
Ninth Symphony.

944
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,110
Fourth movement.

945
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,900
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you !

946
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,930
It's a sin !

947
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,560
It's a sin !

948
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,300
It's a sin !

949
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:28,810
It's a sin ! It's a sin !
It's a sin !

950
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,210
Sin?

951
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,010
What's all this about sin?

952
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:33,410
That!

953
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:37,650
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

954
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,320
Beethoven just wrote music.

955
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,160
Are you referring
to the background score?

956
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,660
You've heard Beethoven before?

957
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,800
So you' re keen on music?

958
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,800
Can't be helped.

959
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,410
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

960
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,570
The governor ought to be pleased.

961
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:10,190
I' m sorry, Alex.

962
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,280
This is for your own good.

963
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,920
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

964
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,760
But it's not fair. It's not fair
I should feel ill when I hear. . .

965
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,590
. . .Lovely, lovely, Ludwig van .

966
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,500
You must take your chance, boy.

967
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,430
The choice has been all yours.

968
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:32,740
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

969
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,010
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing. . .

970
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,440
. . .is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

971
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,650
I've learned me lesson, sir.

972
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,820
I see now what I've
never seen before.

973
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,990
I' m cured.

974
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,020
Praise God!

975
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:50,730
You' re not cured yet, boy.

976
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,060
But, sirs.

977
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,700
Missus!

978
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,060
I see that it's wrong!

979
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:01,330
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

980
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,270
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy. . .

981
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,310
. . .without being
tolchocked and knifed!

982
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,670
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

983
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,610
But be cheerful about it.

984
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,080
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man .

985
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,720
Ladies and gentlemen . . .

986
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,860
. . .at this stage we introduce
the subject himself.

987
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,090
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

988
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,170
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast. . .

989
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,390
. . .undrugged. . .

990
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,440
. . .unhypnotized.

991
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:12,400
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again . . .

992
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:16,270
. . .as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

993
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,880
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen .

994
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,080
From the hoodlum
the state committed. . .

995
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:25,480
. . .to unprofitable punishment
some two years ago.

996
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:28,520
Unchanged after two years.

997
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,490
Unchanged, do I say?

998
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,160
Not quite.

999
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,130
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

1000
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,630
The fawning, greased,
obsequious leer.

1001
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,110
Other vices it taught him. . .

1002
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:48,210
. . .as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

1003
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,470
Our party promised
to restore law and order. . .

1004
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,780
. . .and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen .

1005
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:01,080
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

1006
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:05,020
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is an historic moment.

1007
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:09,690
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

1008
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,670
But enough of words.

1009
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:15,170
Actions speak louder than .

1010
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,030
Action now .

1011
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,580
Observe all .

1012
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,750
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

1013
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,150
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

1014
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,520
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

1015
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,000
Hello, heap of dirt.

1016
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,570
You don't wash much, do you?

1017
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,110
Judging by the horrible smell .

1018
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:59,140
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

1019
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,940
He had a shower this morning.

1020
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,580
You trying to call me a liar?

1021
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:05,650
No, brother.

1022
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:09,050
You must think I' m awfully stupid.

1023
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,560
Why did you do that, brother?

1024
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,830
I've never done wrong to you .

1025
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,130
You want to know why I did that?

1026
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,560
Well, you see. . .

1027
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,140
. . .I do this. . .

1028
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,540
. . .and that. . .

1029
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,010
. . .and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do l?

1030
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,650
And if you want
to start something. . .

1031
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,370
. . .you just go ahead.
Go on !

1032
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:35,780
Please do!

1033
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,220
I' m going to be sick.

1034
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,790
You' re going to be sick, are you?

1035
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,390
I' m going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

1036
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:46,720
You want to get up?

1037
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,860
Well, now you listen to me.

1038
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:51,130
If you want to get up. . .

1039
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,600
. . .you've got to
do something for me.

1040
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:55,470
Here.

1041
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:57,070
Here.

1042
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:59,470
You see that?

1043
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,930
You see that shoe?

1044
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,770
I want you to lick it.

1045
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,280
Go on !

1046
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,820
Lick it.

1047
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:14,290
And, O my brothers,
would you believe...

1048
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,790
...your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator...

1049
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,490
...pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half. ..

1050
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:23,570
...to lick the grahzny,
vonny boots.

1051
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,360
And again !

1052
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:28,060
The horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up...

1053
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,930
...and turned the joy of battle...

1054
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,370
...into a feeling
I was going to snuff it.

1055
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:34,910
And again .

1056
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,400
Nice and clean .

1057
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,180
Thank you very much .

1058
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,220
That will do very well .

1059
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,760
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen .

1060
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,890
She came towards me...

1061
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,970
... with the light like it was the
light light of heavenly grace.

1062
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:08,370
And the thing that flashed
in me gulliver...

1063
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,270
... was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor...

1064
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,670
... with the old in-out.
Real savage.

1065
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,200
But quick as a shot
came the sickness.

1066
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,990
Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner...

1067
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,530
...and now followed
to make his arrest.

1068
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,450
Enough .

1069
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,440
Thank you very much .

1070
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,420
Thank you, my dear.

1071
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,970
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1072
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:24,640
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

1073
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:26,820
-Good.
-Was it all right, sir?

1074
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:27,950
Did I do well?

1075
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:31,520
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

1076
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,050
You see, ladies and gentlemen . . .

1077
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,730
. . .our subject is impelled
towards the good. . .

1078
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:39,660
. . .by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil .

1079
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,630
The intention to act violently. . .

1080
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,230
. . .is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

1081
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,200
To counter these,
the subject has to switch . . .

1082
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:51,400
. . .to a diametrically
opposed attitude.

1083
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,440
Any questions?

1084
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,110
Choice.

1085
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,040
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1086
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,840
Self-interest.

1087
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,990
The fear of physical pain . . .

1088
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:10,720
. . .drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement.

1089
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,590
Its insincerity
was clearly to be seen .

1090
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,770
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1091
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:20,530
He ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice.

1092
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,170
Padre, these are subtleties.

1093
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:26,540
We' re not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

1094
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:30,440
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

1095
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:37,350
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

1096
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,360
He will be your true Christian . . .

1097
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,680
. . .ready to turn the other cheek.

1098
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,950
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

1099
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:50,330
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

1100
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:51,900
Reclamation .

1101
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,430
Joy before the angels of God.

1102
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,770
The point is that it works!

1103
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,550
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator...

1104
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,770
... was a free man.

1105
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,520
Son !

1106
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:51,420
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1107
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:54,030
Mum.

1108
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,160
How are you, love?
Nice to see you .

1109
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,170
-Dad.
-Lad. What a surprise.

1110
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,530
-Good to see you .
-I Keeping fit?

1111
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,570
How are you, then?

1112
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,940
I' m fine, fine.

1113
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:11,110
I Keeping out of trouble, you know .

1114
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,550
I' m back!

1115
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,350
Good to see you .

1116
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,720
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

1117
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,220
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1118
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,370
It's a surprise all right.
A bit bewildering too.

1119
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,430
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

1120
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,540
You should have let us know, lad.

1121
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:39,160
Not that we' re not very pleased
to see you again, and all . . .

1122
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,870
. . .cured too, eh?

1123
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,270
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

1124
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,110
I' m completely reformed.

1125
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,520
Still the same old place, then?

1126
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:06,870
There's a strange fella
sitting on the sofa. . .

1127
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:10,270
. . .munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

1128
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,970
That's Joe.

1129
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:18,880
He lives here now .

1130
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,550
The lodger.

1131
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,310
That's what he is.

1132
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,740
He rents your room.

1133
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,900
How do you do, Joe?

1134
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,230
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1135
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,400
No complaints?

1136
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,310
I've heard about you .

1137
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:49,170
I know what you've done.

1138
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:57,110
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1139
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,950
So you' re back.

1140
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,790
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

1141
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:06,620
Over my dead corpse, you will .

1142
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:10,130
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them. . .

1143
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:12,300
. . .than like a lodger.

1144
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:16,500
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1145
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,280
Do put your hand
over your mouth, please.

1146
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,710
It's bloody revolting.

1147
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,810
Are you all right?

1148
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:35,720
It's the treatment.

1149
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:38,550
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1150
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,560
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1151
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,470
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1152
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:51,870
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1153
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,710
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

1154
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:12,790
That was all . . .

1155
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,730
. . .took away, son .

1156
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:17,060
By the police.

1157
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,470
New regulation, see. . .

1158
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:22,700
. . .about compensation
for the victims.

1159
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:27,140
What about Basil?

1160
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:31,840
Where's my snake?

1161
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,390
He met with . . .

1162
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:45,390
. . .Like, an accident.

1163
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,760
He passed away.

1164
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,200
What's going to happen to me, then?

1165
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,670
I mean . . .

1166
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,300
. . .that's my room he's in .

1167
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:06,380
There's no denying that.

1168
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:10,010
This is my home also.

1169
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,390
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1170
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,860
All this needs thinking about, son .

1171
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:28,000
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

1172
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:30,110
Not just like that, can we?

1173
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,400
I mean . . .

1174
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:33,600
. . .Joe's here doing a job.

1175
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:36,140
A contract it is.
Two years.

1176
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:40,080
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1177
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,750
You see, son . . .

1178
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,610
. . .Joe's paid next month's
rent already. . .

1179
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:53,060
. . .so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say. . .

1180
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:56,320
. . .to get out, now can we?

1181
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:58,600
No, but it's much more than that.

1182
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,940
I mean, I've got you two
to think of. . .

1183
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:05,040
. . .who've been like
a father and mother to me.

1184
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,240
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two. . .

1185
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:11,410
. . .to the tender mercies
of this young monster. . .

1186
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,910
. . .who's been like
no real son at all .

1187
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,880
Look, he's weeping now .

1188
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:21,060
But that's all his craft
and artfulness.

1189
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:24,160
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

1190
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,730
Let him learn the errors of his way,
and that a bad boy. . .

1191
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:32,460
. . .doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1192
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,440
All right.

1193
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,410
I know how things are now .

1194
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:46,540
I've suffered and I've suffered. . .

1195
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,720
. . .and I've suffered.

1196
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,580
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

1197
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,720
You've made others suffer.

1198
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:00,390
It's only right
that you should suffer proper.

1199
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:03,060
I've been told
everything you've done. . .

1200
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:05,260
. . .sitting here at night
around the table.

1201
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:08,560
And pretty shocking
it was to listen to.

1202
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,640
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

1203
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:18,170
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1204
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,080
Come on . It's all right now .

1205
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,160
Right.

1206
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,660
I' m leaving now .

1207
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,990
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1208
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,970
I'll make me own way.

1209
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:45,070
Thank you very much . Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

1210
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,380
Now, don't take it like that, son .

1211
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:54,440
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1212
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,410
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1213
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:06,110
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1214
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,910
Thanks, brother.

1215
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,730
Janie Mack!

1216
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,670
May the hokey fly!

1217
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,530
Holy Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1218
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:58,370
I never forget a face, be God!

1219
01:37:58,580 --> 01:37:59,940
I never forget any face.

1220
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,980
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1221
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:06,740
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in .

1222
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:08,140
Him and his friends.

1223
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:11,250
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1224
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:13,050
Stop him! Stop him!

1225
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:17,250
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1226
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,830
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men...

1227
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:23,190
...trying to get at
your humble narrator...

1228
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,060
... with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

1229
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:30,170
It was old age
having a go at youth.

1230
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:34,110
And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

1231
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:36,370
It being better
to be hit at like that...

1232
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:39,240
...than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

1233
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:40,880
All right, all right!

1234
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,050
Stop it now .

1235
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:45,650
Come on . Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1236
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:48,720
Back away! Go away with you !

1237
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:51,220
What's your trouble, sir?

1238
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,300
Well .

1239
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,400
Well, well, well .

1240
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:07,140
Well, well, well, well .

1241
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,830
If it isn't little Alex.

1242
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:11,510
Long time no viddy, droog.

1243
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:13,200
How goes?

1244
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,710
It's impossible.

1245
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,110
I don't believe it.

1246
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,290
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1247
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:20,320
Nothing up our sleeves.

1248
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,620
No magic, little Alex.

1249
01:39:22,830 --> 01:39:26,320
A job for two
who are now of job age:

1250
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,100
The police.

1251
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:45,040
Come on, Alex.

1252
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:46,840
Come for walking.

1253
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:00,860
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

1254
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,660
I just don't get this at all .

1255
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,090
The old days are dead and gone.

1256
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:08,130
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1257
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,100
I've been cured.

1258
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:11,570
That was read out to us.

1259
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:13,670
The inspector read it
all out to us.

1260
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:16,570
He said it was a very good way.

1261
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,080
But what is all this?

1262
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:20,840
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

1263
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:23,780
You' re not on their side,
and can't be.

1264
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,550
You can't be, Dim.

1265
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:29,490
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days. . .

1266
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:33,150
. . .trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

1267
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,890
A long time is right.

1268
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,330
I don't remember them days,
too horrorshow .

1269
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:39,690
And don't call me Dim
no more, either.

1270
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,000
Officer, call me.

1271
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:45,770
Enough is remembered, though,
little Alex.

1272
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,500
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

1273
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,600
That's enough .

1274
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,400
A bit more. He's still kicking.

1275
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,160
Cured, are you?

1276
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,600
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

1277
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:34,940
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

1278
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,310
I cried for meself.

1279
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:40,490
Home, home, home.

1280
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,660
It was home I was wanting.

1281
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,920
And it was home
I came to, brothers...

1282
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:48,760
...not realizing,
in the state I was in...

1283
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:52,030
... where I was, and had been before.

1284
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:42,210
Who on earth could that be?

1285
01:43:57,630 --> 01:43:59,330
I'll see who it is.

1286
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,440
Yes, what is it?

1287
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,350
Please. . . .

1288
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,610
Frank, I think this young man
needs some help.

1289
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:48,780
My God!

1290
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,980
What's happened to you, my boy?

1291
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:58,150
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends...

1292
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,660
...there was your
faithful narrator...

1293
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:03,350
...being held helpless
like a babe in arms...

1294
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:06,030
...and suddenly realizing
where he was...

1295
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:09,640
...and why "home " on the gate
had looked so familiar.

1296
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,640
But I knew I was safe.

1297
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,930
I knew he would not remember me.

1298
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,970
For in those carefree days...

1299
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:18,110
...l and my so-called droogs...

1300
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:21,840
... wore our maskies, which were
like real horrorshow disguises.

1301
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:24,280
Police.

1302
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:30,150
Ghastly, horrible police.

1303
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:33,720
They beat me up, sir.

1304
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,430
The police beat me up.

1305
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:44,170
I know you !

1306
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:50,510
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

1307
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:53,050
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

1308
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,510
Are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique?

1309
01:45:56,890 --> 01:45:58,110
Yes, sir.

1310
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:01,790
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

1311
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:05,150
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1312
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,520
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

1313
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:13,260
My heart goes out to you .
You' re not the first to come here.

1314
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:16,400
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

1315
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:18,070
But it's providential that you . . .

1316
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:21,770
. . .who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

1317
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,810
But you' re cold and shivering.

1318
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,720
Julian . . .

1319
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:31,180
. . .draw a bath for this young man .

1320
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,790
Certainly, Frank.

1321
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,750
Thank you very much .

1322
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,550
God bless you .

1323
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,130
I'm singing in the rain

1324
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,380
Just singing in the rain

1325
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:33,880
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable. . .

1326
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,280
. . .to ensure the government
is not returned in the election .

1327
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:39,350
The government's big boast, sir. . .

1328
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:42,320
. . .is the way they have
dealt with crime:

1329
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:44,390
Recruiting young roughs
into the police. . .

1330
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:47,690
. . .proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1331
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:50,160
We've seen it before
in other countries.

1332
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,890
The thin end of the wedge.

1333
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:56,200
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1334
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:04,610
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

1335
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:08,650
The people, the common people,
must know, must see.

1336
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:13,250
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. The tradition of liberty is all .

1337
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,480
The common people
will let it go, yes.

1338
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:17,890
They'll sell liberty
for a quieter life.

1339
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,650
That is why they must be led.

1340
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,960
Driven, pushed.

1341
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,260
Fine.

1342
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:30,970
Thank you very much, sir.

1343
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,410
He'll be here.

1344
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:00,660
Good evening, sir.

1345
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,190
Good evening.

1346
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,600
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

1347
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:12,270
There was no one around,
so I started.

1348
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:14,270
Hope that's all right, sir.

1349
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:19,510
Of course.

1350
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:52,740
Food all right?

1351
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:00,150
Great, sir. Great.

1352
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:05,390
Try the wine.

1353
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,100
Thank you, sir.

1354
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:16,970
Cheers.

1355
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:20,270
Happy days.

1356
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:33,080
Won't you join me?

1357
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,050
My health doesn't allow it.

1358
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:38,190
No, thank you .

1359

Very nice little number.

1367
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:28,040
Here's to it.

1368
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:39,350
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1369
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,420
I' m pleased you
appreciate good wine.

1370
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:45,460
Have another glass.

1371
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:00,010
My wife. . .

1372
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:05,040
. . .used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

1373
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,580
Your wife? Is she away?

1374
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:12,120
She's dead!

1375
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:18,160
I' m sorry to hear about that.

1376
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,730
She was very badly raped, you see.

1377
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,420
We were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums. . .

1378
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,030
. . .in this very room
you' re sitting in now .

1379
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:30,970
I was left a helpless cripple, but
for her the agony was too great.

1380
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,170
The doctors said
it was pneumonia. . .

1381
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:36,240
. . .because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

1382
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:40,780
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1383
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:45,320
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl .

1384
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,880
And now, you .

1385
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:54,500
Another victim of the modern age.

1386
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,800
But you can be helped.

1387
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:01,290
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath .

1388
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,370
Some. . .

1389
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:03,660
. . .friends?

1390
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:05,460
They want to help you .

1391
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:08,040
-Help me?
-Help you .

1392
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:11,740
-Who are they?
-Very, very important people.

1393
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:14,380
And they' re interested in you .

1394
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,020
This'll be these people now .

1395
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:25,630
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

1396
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,730
No trouble at all .

1397
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:30,630
Here.

1398
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,800
Let me fill your glass.

1399
01:54:58,630 --> 01:55:00,360
So this is the young man?

1400
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,160
How do you do, sir?

1401
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,190
Missus.
I' m very pleased to meet you .

1402

I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour. . .

were in trouble. . .

01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:13,770
. . .and so we came over to see
if we could help.

1405
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:16,240
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much .

1406
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:18,740

1410
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,350
Yes, I suppose
you could call it that.

1411
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,920
How are you feeling now?

1412
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,420
Much better, thank you .

1413
01:55:29,630 --> 01:55:32,030
Feel like talking,
answering a few questions?

1414
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:33,630
Fine, sir. Fine.

1415
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,130
As I said, we've heard about you .

1416
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:40,260
We are interested in your case.

1417
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:43,370
-We want to help you .
-Thank you very much .

1418
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:44,540
Shall we. . .

1419
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:46,840
. . .get down to it?

1420
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,770
Fine. Fine, sir.

1421
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,880
The newspapers mentioned. . .

1422
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:59,710
. . .that in addition to your being
conditioned against. . .

1423
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,480
. . .acts of sex and violence. . .

1424
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:05,060
. . .you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

1425
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:09,160
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

1426
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,300
You see, missus. . .

1427
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:14,960
. . .I' m very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven .

1428
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,160
Ludwig van Beethoven .

1429
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:20,640
-B-E--
-That's all right. Thank you .

1430
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:25,310
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me. . .

1431
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:29,470
. . .a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp. . .

1432
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:33,280
. . .the background music
was playing Beethoven .

1433
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:36,290
So now you have
the same reaction to music. . .

1434
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:38,290
. . .as you do to sex and violence?

1435
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:42,790
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the 9th .

1436
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,830
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?

1437
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:48,090
That's right. I can't listen
to the 9th anymore at all .

1438
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:51,830
When I hear the 9th, I get, like. . .

1439
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,670
. . .this funny feeling.

1440
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:59,080
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

1441
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:03,720
-I beg your pardon?
-Snuff it. Death, I mean .

1442
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,510
I just want to die peacefully. . .

1443
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:09,290
. . .Like, with no pain .

1444
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:11,960
Do you feel that way now?

1445
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:15,100
No, sir, not exactly.

1446
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,590
I still feel . . .

1447
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,130
. . .very miserable.

1448
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:20,860
Very much down in spirits.

1449
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:22,740
Do you still feel . . .

1450
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:24,460
. . .suicidal?

1451
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:29,470
Put it this way:

1452
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:32,610
I feel very low in meself.

1453
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:35,820
I can't see much in the future.

1454
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:40,460
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

1455
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,330
Well done, Frank.

1456
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,070
Get the car, would you please?

1457
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,760
I woke up.

1458
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:34,870
The pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

1459
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:45,720
Then I realized what it was.

1460
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:49,820
The music coming up
from the floor...

1461
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:53,260
... was our old friend
Ludwig van...

1462
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:56,120
...and the dreaded 9th Symphony.

1463
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:05,470
Let me out!

1464
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:07,470
Open the door!

1465
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:10,340
Come on, open the door!

1466
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,210
Turn it off!

1467
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:16,140
Turn it off!

1468
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,740
Turn it off!

1469
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:20,680
Turn it off!

1470
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:22,690
Turn it off!

1471
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:24,020
Stop it!

1472
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:13,830
Turn it off!

1473
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:16,230
Please!

1474
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:18,570
Turn it off!

1475
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,430
Suddenly I viddied
what I had to do...

1476
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:38,030
...and what I had wanted to do.

1477
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:40,870
And that was to do myself in.

1478
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:42,630
To snuff it.

1479
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:46,370
To blast off forever
out of this wicked, cruel world.

1480
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:50,380
One moment of pain perhaps...

1481
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,510
...and then, sleep.

1482
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:55,240
Forever and ever...

1483
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:56,780
. . .and ever.

1484
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,040
I jumped, O my brothers...

1485
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,770
...and I fell hard.

1486
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:27,240
But I did not snuff it.

1487
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,470
If I had snuffed it...

1488
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:32,980
...l would not be here
to tell what I told have.

1489
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:39,590
I came back to life
after a long, black black gap...

1490
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:43,130
...of what might have been
a million years.

1491
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:14,380
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

1492
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,930
Hello, lad.

1493
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:57,760
Hello, son .

1494
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:00,140
How are you?

1495
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:03,280
Are you feeling better?

1496
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,840
What. . .

1497
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:10,070
. . .gives. . .

1498
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,540
. . .O my Pee and Em?

1499
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,080
What makes. . .

1500
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:17,820
. . .you think. . .

1501
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:20,520
. . .you are welcome?

1502
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:25,420
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

1503
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:27,290
He doesn't mean it.

1504
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:32,300
You were in the papers again, son .

1505
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:34,670
It said. . .

1506
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:37,570
. . .they had done a
great wrong to you .

1507
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:39,840
It said. . .

1508
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,480
. . .how the government. . .

1509
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:43,710
. . .drove you to try. . .

1510
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,510
. . .and do yourself in .

1511
02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:49,590
And when you think about it, son . . .

1512
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:53,250
. . .maybe it was our fault too. . .

1513
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:54,920
. . .in a way.

1514
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:57,960
Your home's your home. . .

1515
02:03:58,330 --> 02:04:00,800
. . .when all's said and done, son .

1516
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:13,340
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Doctor.

1517
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:24,550
-How are you feeling today?
-Fine. Fine.

1518
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:25,890
Good. May l?

1519
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:28,420
-I' m Dr. Taylor.
-Haven't seen you before.

1520
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:29,960
I' m your psychiatrist.

1521
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:32,100
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

1522
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:33,930
Just part of hospital routine.

1523
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:36,260
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

1524
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,030
I' m going to show you
some slides. . .

1525
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:43,110
. . .and you' re going to tell me
what you think about them.

1526
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:44,910
Jolly good.

1527
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:48,610
You know anything about dreams?

1528
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:50,210
Something, yes.

1529
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:52,210
-You know what they mean?
-Perhaps.

1530
02:04:52,420 --> 02:04:53,850
You concerned about something?

1531
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:57,110
No, not concerned, really. . .

1532
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,420
. . .but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1533
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:01,090
Very nasty.

1534
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:03,190
It's like. . .

1535
02:05:05,230 --> 02:05:07,460
. . .when I was all smashed up,
you know . . .

1536
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:09,730
. . .and half-awake
and unconscious-like. . .

1537
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:12,130
. . .I kept having this dream.

1538
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:15,270
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

1539
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,570
You know, like the inside
of me brain .

1540
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:20,680
I seem to have this dream
over and over again .

1541
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,010
Do you think it means anything?

1542
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:28,420
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

1543
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:30,720
It's all part
of the recovery process.

1544
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:34,830
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply. . .

1545
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:37,050
. . .from one of the people
in the picture.

1546
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:40,530
You tell me what you think
the person would say.

1547
02:05:40,730 --> 02:05:41,630
All right?

1548
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,270
Righty-right.

1549
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:47,670
" isn’t the plumage beautiful? "

1550
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:51,210
I just say what the
other person would say?

1551
02:05:55,450 --> 02:05:57,010
Don't think about it too long.

1552
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,740
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1553
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:04,790
Cabbages. I Knickers.

1554
02:06:05,890 --> 02:06:08,260
It's not got a beak.

1555
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:09,760
Good.

1556
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:17,340
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill . "

1557
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:20,070
My mind is a blank. . .

1558
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:25,080
. . .and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

1559
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,300
Good.

1560
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,940
"What do you want? "

1561
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:35,490
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

1562
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:37,190
Good.

1563
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:44,190
"You sold me a crummy watch .
I want my money back. "

1564
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:47,900
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1565
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:54,970
"You can do whatever
you like with these. "

1566
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:58,340
Eggiwegs.

1567
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:00,840
I would like. . .

1568
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:02,380
. . .to smash them.

1569
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:04,520
And pick them all up. . .

1570
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,350
. . .and throw--

1571
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:08,040
Fucking hell !

1572
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,260
There. That's all there is to it.

1573
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:13,380
Are you all right?

1574
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:15,590
Hope so.

1575
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,890
Is that the end, then?
I was quite enjoying that.

1576
02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:20,530
Good. I' m glad.

1577
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,930
How many did I get right?

1578
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:24,000
It's not that kind of a test.

1579
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:27,570
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

1580
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:29,640
When do I get out, then?

1581
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,400
I' m sure it won't be long now .

1582
02:07:33,850 --> 02:07:35,470
So I waited.

1583
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:37,310
And, O my brothers...

1584
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:39,090
...l got a lot better...

1585
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:42,520
...munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast...

1586
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:45,190
...and lovely steakie-wakes.

1587
02:07:45,390 --> 02:07:46,880
And then one day...

1588
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:51,260
...they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

1589
02:07:56,670 --> 02:07:59,370
Just wait outside for a moment,
would you, Officer?

1590
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,710
I' m afraid my change of schedule
has thrown you .

1591
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,210
The patient's in the middle
of supper.

1592
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:10,280
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all .

1593
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:14,850
-Good evening, my boy.
-Hi there, my little droogies.

1594
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:16,890
How' re you getting on, young man?

1595
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:19,490
Great, sir. Just great.

1596
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:21,850
Can I do anything more for you?

1597
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,860
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

1598
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:26,690
Then I leave you to it. Nurse.

1599
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:32,800
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1600
02:08:33,110 --> 02:08:34,370
Yes, sir.

1601
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:37,240
And a very lonely place
it is too. . .

1602
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,880
. . .when I wake up in the night
with me pain .

1603
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,650
Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1604
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:46,450
I kept in touch
with the hospital, of course.

1605
02:08:46,650 --> 02:08:48,520
And now I've come down personally. . .

1606
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,350
. . .to see how you' re getting along.

1607
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:53,090
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1608
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:54,850
Tortures of the damned.

1609
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:58,160
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely dis--

1610
02:08:58,370 --> 02:09:01,130
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1611
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:07,600
I can tell you that l, and the
government of which I' m a member. . .

1612
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:11,770
. . .are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1613
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,240
We tried to help you .

1614
02:09:13,450 --> 02:09:17,580
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

1615
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:21,790
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1616
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:25,720
We want you to regard us
as friends.

1617
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:27,120
We put you right.

1618
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:29,560
You' re getting
the best of treatment.

1619
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,030
We never wished you harm.

1620
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:34,960
But there are some who did, and do.

1621
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:38,170
And I think you know who those are.

1622
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:42,540
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1623
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:45,180
They would have been
glad to have you dead. . .

1624
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:48,540
. . .for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

1625
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:51,480
There is also a certain man . . .

1626
02:09:51,690 --> 02:09:54,210
. . .a writer of subversive
literature. . .

1627
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:56,580
. . .who has been howling
for your blood.

1628
02:09:56,790 --> 02:10:00,230
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you .

1629
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:02,190
But you' re safe from him now .

1630
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,420
We put him away.

1631
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,460
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1632
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:12,500
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1633
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:16,940
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible. . .

1634
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:20,600
. . .for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1635
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:22,610
He was a menace.

1636
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:24,980
We put him away
for his own protection .

1637
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:26,480
And also for yours.

1638
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:28,720
Where is he now?

1639
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,410
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1640
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:35,750
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

1641
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:38,020
We are interested in you .

1642
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:41,860
When you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

1643
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:44,230
A good job on a good salary.

1644
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:46,130
What job and how much?

1645
02:10:47,070 --> 02:10:51,070
You must have an interesting job at
a salary you'd regard as adequate.

1646
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:53,470
Not only for the job
you' re going to do. . .

1647
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:57,380
. . .and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered. . .

1648
02:10:57,580 --> 02:11:01,250
. . .but also because
you are helping us.

1649
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,010
Helping you?

1650
02:11:04,290 --> 02:11:07,420
We always help our friends,
don't we?

1651
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:16,130
It is no secret
that this government. . .

1652
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:19,500
. . .has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1653
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:23,160
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1654
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:26,070
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view . . .

1655
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:27,840
. . .of what we tried to do.

1656
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:32,050
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1657
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:34,020
And you, Alex--

1658
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:36,120
If I may call you Alex. . . .

1659
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:39,620
Certainly.
What do they call you at home?

1660
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:42,260
My name is Frederick.

1661
02:11:43,230 --> 02:11:45,100
As I was saying, Alex. . .

1662
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:50,170
. . .you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1663
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,470
Do you understand, Alex?

1664
02:11:56,380 --> 02:11:58,570
Do I make myself clear?

1665
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,850
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1666
02:12:04,350 --> 02:12:07,790
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1667
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:09,420
You can rely on me, Fred.

1668
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:11,060
Good.

1669
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:12,690
Good boy.

1670
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:15,630
I understand you' re fond of music.

1671
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:18,090
I have arranged a little
surprise for you .

1672
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:19,830
Surprise?

1673
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:21,830
One that I hope
that you will like. . .

1674
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:23,400
. . .as a. . . .

1675
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,640
How shall we put it?

1676
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,070
As a symbol of
our new understanding.

1677
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:33,380
An understanding
between two friends.

1678
02:13:53,390 --> 02:13:55,990
I was cured, all right.
