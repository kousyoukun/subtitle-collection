1
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:17,620
There was me.

2
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,756
That is, Alex, and my three droogs.

3
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:24,658
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

4
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,627
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...

5
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,134
... what to do with the evening.

6
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,935
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

7
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:39,840
Milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom...

8
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:42,039
... which is what we were drinking.

9
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,983
This would sharpen you up...

10
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:48,178
...and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

11
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:55,985
In Dublin's fair city

12
00:01:56,698 --> 00:02:00,794
Where the girls are so pretty

13
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:04,963
I first set my eyes

14
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,602
On sweet Molly Malone

15
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:15,411
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

16
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:20,017
Through streets broad and narrow

17
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:24,724
Crying, "Cockles and mussels ..."

18
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,820
One thing I could never stand ...

19
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:30,429
... was to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie...

20
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:33,326
...howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers...

21
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:35,933
...and going "blerp blerp" in between...

22
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:40,437
...as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

23
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,337
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

24
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:47,708
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

25
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:59,349
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers?

26
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:07,626
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

27
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,734
Not in a stinking world like this.

28
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:16,637
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,144
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

30
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:24,476
It stinks because it lets the young get onto the old...

31
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:26,777
...like you done!

32
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:31,889
It's no world for an old man any longer.

33
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,896
What kind of a world is it at all?

34
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,997
Men on the moon.

35
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,790
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:44,062
And there's not no attention paid...

37
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:47,799
...to earthly law and order no more.

38
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,770
Oh, dear land

39
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,477
I fought for thee

40
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,516
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...

41
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:34,813
...and his four droogs.

42
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,556
They were about to perform
a little of the old...

43
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:41,761
...in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

44
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:34,780
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...

45
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:39,315
... billy goat Billy-boy in poison.

46
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:41,780
How are thou...

47
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,890
...thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil?

48
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,189
Come and get one in the yarbles...

49
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,296
...if you have any yarbles...

50
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:55,525
...you eunuch jelly, thou.

51
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,701
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,164
The police!

53
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,393
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:27,920
The Durango 95 purred away real horrorshow.

55
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:32,394
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

56
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:35,830
Soon it was trees and dark, my brothers...

57
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,631
... with real country dark.

58
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:18,673
We fillied around with other travelers of the night...

59
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,279
...playing Hogs of the Road.

60
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,473
Then we headed west.

61
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:27,448
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

62
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:28,882
That was a real kick...

63
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,593
...and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

64
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,034
Who on earth could that be?

65
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:34,746
I'll go and see.

66
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes, who is it?

67
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:51,428
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

68
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:56,773
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?

69
00:09:57,044 --> 00:10:00,343
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

70
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:03,177
But, missus, it's a matter of life and death!

71
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:04,781
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,579
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,484
He wants to use the telephone.

74
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,960
Well, I suppose you better let him in.

75
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,860
Wait a minute, will you?

76
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:22,298
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in--

77
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:36,213
What do you want from me?

78
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,820
Pete, check the rest of the house. Dim ...

79
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,892
I'm singing in the rain

80
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,831
Just singing in the rain

81
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:55,532
What a glorious feeling

82
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:57,894
I'm happy again

83
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,105
I'm laughing at clouds

84
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:03,608
So dark up above

85
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,603
The sun's in my heart

86
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,845
And I'm ready for love

87
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,749
Let the stormy clouds chase

88
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,556
Everyone from the place

89
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,223
Come on with the rain

90
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:23,255
I've a smile on my face

91
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:26,358
I'll walk down the lane

92
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,268
With a happy refrain

93
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:32,269
And I'm singing

94
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,373
Just singing...

95
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,670
...in the rain

96
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm singing in the rain

97
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,840
Just singing in the rain

98
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,840
What a glorious feeling

99
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:01,194
I'm happy again

100
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,305
I'm laughing at clouds

101
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,608
So dark up above

102
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,603
The sun's in my heart

103
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,845
And I'm ready for love

104
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,540
Let the stormy clouds chase

105
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:24,356
Everyone from the place

106
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:27,223
Come on with the rain

107
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:30,855
I've a smile on my face

108
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:34,158
I'll walk down the lane

109
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:38,268
With a happy refrain

110
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,669
And I'm singing

111
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,373
Just singing...

112
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,512
...in the rain

113
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:45,945
Viddy well, little brother.

114
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:47,841
Viddy well.

115
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:12,036
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...

116
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,867
...it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure, oh my brothers.

117
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:22,081
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

118
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:29,879
Hello, Lucy.

119
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,686
Had a busy night?

120
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,795
We've been working hard too.

121
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,064
Pardon me, Luce.

122
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:52,201
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...

123
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,708
...laughing and govoreeting.

124
00:13:55,015 --> 00:14:00,112
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.

125
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:04,320
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

126
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,891
And in the short silence
before the next one came on...

127
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,291
...she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

128
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:17,433
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers...

129
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:21,037
...some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

130
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:24,438
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...

131
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,610
...standing endwise.

132
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:31,108
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...

133
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:32,944
...and then down again.

134
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,916
Because I knew what she sang.

135
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,557
It was a bit from the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

136
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,462
What did you do that for?

137
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,762
For being a bastard with no manners.

138
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,941
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise, O my brother.

139
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,978
I don't like you should
do what you done.

140
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,851
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

141
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,689
Watch that.

142
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,791
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

143
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:20,995
Yarbles!

144
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,997
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

145
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:28,100
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

146
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,003
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

147
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:34,379
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

148
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:42,520
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

149
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,133
Doobidoob.

150
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,332
A bit tired maybe.

151
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,312
Best not to say more.

152
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,140
Bedways is rightways now.

153
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:14,746
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

154
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:16,522
Right, right?

155
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:19,540
-Right, right.
-Right, right.

156
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:31,432
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...

157
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:36,073
...in municipal flat block
18-A, Linear North.

158
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,930
It had been a wonderful evening.

159
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:07,656
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...

160
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,869
... was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

161
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,319
Oh, bliss!

162
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,983
Bliss and heaven!

163
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:10,087
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

164
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:14,924
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.

165
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:18,593
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...

166
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,636
...gravity all nonsense now.

167
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,608
As I slooshied...

168
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,903
...I knew such lovely pictures.

169
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,924
Alex. Alex!

170
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:55,426
Alex. Alex!

171
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,565
What do you want?

172
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:58,369
It's past eight, Alex.

173
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:01,671
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

174
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,778
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

175
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:08,577
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

176
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,587
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

177
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,585
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

178
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,056
Got to rest, Mum.

179
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:19,394
Got to get fit.

180
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,292
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

181
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:28,768
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

182
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,008
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

183
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:41,481
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

184
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,588
Yes. Yes, I heard.

185
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,514
You know what time he got in?

186
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:48,784
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

187
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:52,921
I wonder...

188
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,326
...where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

189
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,938
Like he says...

190
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,540
...it's mostly odd things he does.

191
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,936
Helping-like...

192
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:07,840
... here and there, as it might be.

193
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,480
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

194
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,692
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

195
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:57,853
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

196
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:01,490
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

197
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,759
She gave me the key.

198
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,803
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

199
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:12,011
Hence, not at school, yes?

200
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:15,509
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

201
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:17,876
It should be clear
by this afterlunch.

202
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:21,312
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

203
00:22:21,621 --> 00:22:24,886
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

204
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:28,584
-Cup of the old chai, sir?
-No time, no time.

205
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:30,419
Sit, sit, sit!

206
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:34,796
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

207
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:36,695
Anything wrong, sir?

208
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:40,737
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

209
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,441
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

210
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:44,940
Just a manner of speech.

211
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:48,238
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your...

212
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:51,747
... post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

213
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:55,545
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

214
00:22:55,755 --> 00:23:00,124
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

215
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:02,158
If you've no respect
for yourself...

216
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:05,456
...you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

217
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:09,759
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

218
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,267
A confession of failure
for every one of you...

219
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:16,440
...who ends up in the stripy hole.

220
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:18,473
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

221
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:21,372
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

222
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:22,979
Sir, I mean.

223
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,741
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

224
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,250
Just because the police
haven't picked you up...

225
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:31,652
...doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

226
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:36,989
There was a bit of nastiness last night.
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

227
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:41,495
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

228
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,099
Your name was mentioned.

229
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,600
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

230
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:48,672
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

231
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:52,172
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

232
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:53,970
I'm warning you, little Alex...

233
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:56,511
... being a good friend
to you as always...

234
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:59,514
...the one man in this
sore and sick community...

235
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,415
...who wants to save you
from yourself!

236
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:23,536
What gets into you all?

237
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,041
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

238
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:29,440
But we get no farther
with our studies.

239
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:32,217
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

240
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:34,545
You've got not too bad of a brain.

241
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:38,017
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

242
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,156
Nobody's got anything on me.

243
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,158
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

244
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:47,857
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

245
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,965
You're about due, by my reckoning.

246
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,568
That's why I'm warning you...

247
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:55,274
...to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

248
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:56,872
Do I make myself clear?

249
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:58,544
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

250
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:02,179
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

251
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,680
You can rely on me, sir.

252
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,442
Excuse me, brother.

253
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:16,315
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

254
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:19,022
Just a minute.

255
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,944
Pardon me, ladies.

256
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:58,157
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

257
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,067
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

258
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:11,308
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

259
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:14,980
Who you getting, bratty?

260
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:17,308
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

261
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:19,484
The Heaven 17?

262
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:27,589
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

263
00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:32,126
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

264
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,526
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

265
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,828
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

266
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:40,096
You are invited.

267
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,421
Hi, hi, hi, there.

268
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,679
Well, hello.

269
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:07,586
He are here!
He have arrived!

270
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:09,419
Hooray!

271
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,826
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

272
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:19,300
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

273
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:26,339
We got worried.

274
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:34,118
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko...

275
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,846
...and you had not turned up.

276
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,552
And we thought
you might have been, like...

277
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:42,125
...offended by something
or other.

278
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:44,762
So around we come to your abode.

279
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:52,364
Appy polly loggies.

280
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:55,766
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

281
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:58,873
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

282
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:01,545
Sorry about the pain.

283
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:04,739
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

284
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:11,445
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

285
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:14,189
You sure the pain is gone?

286
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:17,754
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

287
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:43,518
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

288
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:49,417
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such...

289
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:52,393
...does not become you,
my little brothers.

290
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:57,335
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

291
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:00,432
Now then, Dim.

292
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,836
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

293
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:10,612
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

294
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,318
That's part of the new way.

295
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,962
New way?
What's this about a new way?

296
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:31,168
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

297
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,472
If you must have it,
have it, then.

298
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:38,937
We go around shop crasting
and the like...

299
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:42,773
...coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

300
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:45,380
And Will the English
in the Muscleman coffee mesto...

301
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:49,247
...saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

302
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:51,389
The shiny stuff. The ice!

303
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:55,685
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

304
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,995
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

305
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Have you not everything you need?

306
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:06,370
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

307
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:09,699
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

308
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:14,505
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

309
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,906
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

310
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:22,219
Good! Real horrorshow!

311
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,822
Initiative comes to thems that wait.

312
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,483
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

313
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:33,297
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

314
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:39,833
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

315
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,839
-Something to sharpen us up.
-Some moloko plus.

316
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:50,246
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

317
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:00,557
As we walked along
the flatblock marina...

318
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,058
...I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

319
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:07,855
So now it was to be
Georgie the General...

320
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,567
...saying what we should do
and what not to do.

321
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,772
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

322
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,670
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...

323
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:24,076
...and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.

324
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:28,384
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

325
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:31,748
There was a window open
with a stereo on...

326
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:35,256
...and I viddied right at once what to do.

327
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,421
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.

328
00:34:44,664 --> 00:34:46,962
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...

329
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,532
... the red, red kroovy soon stopped.

330
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:53,465
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...

331
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:56,437
... down in the snug of the Duke of New York.

332
00:34:57,276 --> 00:35:00,837
Now they knew who was master and leader.

333
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:03,281
Sheep, thought I.

334
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:05,676
But a real leader knows
always when, like...

335
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:09,182
... to give and show generous
to his unders.

336
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,986
Well! Now we're back to where we were.

337
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:15,590
Yes?

338
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,692
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

339
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:20,590
Right, right, right?

340
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:23,493
Right.

341
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:27,497
Right.

342
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,999
Right.

343
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:37,108
Well, Georgie-boy...

344
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:41,317
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

345
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:44,080
Not tonight.

346
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,017
Not this nochy.

347
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:49,217
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

348
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:53,094
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

349
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:56,631
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

350
00:35:57,336 --> 00:36:00,999
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

351
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:09,712
It's this health farm.

352
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,841
A bit out of the town.

353
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,343
Isolated.

354
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:21,052
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.

355
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:26,155
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.

356
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:31,230
It's full up with, like, gold and silver...

357
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,461
...and, like, jewels.

358
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:38,775
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.

359
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:45,882
Oh, shit!

360
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,500
Who's there?

361
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:08,096
Excuse me, can you please help?

362
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:09,899
There's been a terrible accident!

363
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:13,078
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

364
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:16,081
I'm frightfully sorry.

365
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:20,510
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

366
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:22,617
I suggest you use that.

367
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:24,813
But missus, this is an emergency!

368
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:26,921
It's a matter of life and death!

369
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:30,926
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

370
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:36,925
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

371
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,102
Very well, madam.

372
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,635
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious...

373
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:47,709
...with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

374
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:50,539
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

375
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,218
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

376
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:56,546
Thank you very much.
Good night.

377
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:34,591
Dim, bend down.

378
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,865
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

379
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:10,224
Hello, Radlett Police Station?

380
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:14,431
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

381
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:20,428
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

382
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,540
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

383
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:27,742
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

384
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,242
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

385
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:32,949
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

386
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:37,120
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning...

387
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:41,554
...in connection with the writer and
his wife who were assaulted last night.

388
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:44,921
Just a few minutes ago.

389
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:48,962
If you think that's necessary.

390
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:51,930
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

391
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:55,267
All right, fine.

392
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:58,335
Thank you very much.

393
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:04,474
Hi, hi, hi, there.

394
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:06,148
At last we meet.

395
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:10,982
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory.

396
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,588
Who are you?

397
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:16,784
How the hell did you get in here?

398
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:21,995
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

399
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:27,868
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

400
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:30,699
You filthy old soomaka.

401
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,503
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

402
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:38,271
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

403
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:42,977
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

404
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:45,622
It's a very important work of art.

405
00:40:56,435 --> 00:40:58,903
What the bloody hell do you want?

406
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,140
To be perfectly honest, madam...

407
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:06,741
... I'm taking part in an
international students'contest...

408
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:10,746
...to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

409
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,043
Cut the shit, sonny...

410
00:41:13,352 --> 00:41:17,914
...and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

411
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:21,351
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...

412
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:23,427
... before I throw you out!

413
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:26,729
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

414
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,962
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

415
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,170
Fucking...

416
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:34,361
...little...

417
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:36,464
... bastard!

418
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:49,114
-Let's go. The police are coming!
-One minoota, droogie.

419
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:58,619
You bastards! I'm blind!

420
00:42:58,857 --> 00:43:02,918
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

421
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:19,972
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

422
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:24,479
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

423
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,444
I know the law, you bastards.

424
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:36,955
Righty-right, Tom.

425
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:42,298
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

426
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:45,195
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

427
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:02,815
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

428
00:44:03,822 --> 00:44:05,722
Shame, isn't it?

429
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:08,617
Spoils all your beauty.

430
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:12,323
Who gave you that, then?

431
00:44:13,732 --> 00:44:15,495
How'd you do that, then?

432
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:20,028
What's your point, you bastard?

433
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,534
That is for your lady victim.

434
00:44:22,841 --> 00:44:24,035
You ghastly...

435
00:44:24,243 --> 00:44:26,006
...wretched scoundrel.

436
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:29,540
Get him off me!

437
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,642
You rotten little bastard!

438
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,154
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

439
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:44,055
Good evening, Sergeant.

440
00:44:44,363 --> 00:44:45,455
They're in room B, sir.

441
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:47,358
Thank you very much.

442
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:49,527
Sergeant--

443
00:44:49,768 --> 00:44:50,666
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

444
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:52,436
Good evening, Inspector.

445
00:44:52,671 --> 00:44:55,572
-Would you like your tea now, sir?
-No, thank you, Sergeant.
We'll have it later

446
00:44:55,874 --> 00:44:57,774
-May I have some paper towels, please?
-Yes, sir.

447
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:00,374
We're interrogating the prisoner now.

448
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:04,174
-Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
-Thank you very much.

449
00:45:04,783 --> 00:45:07,752
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

450
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:12,883
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

451
00:45:13,091 --> 00:45:14,956
Just look at the state of him.

452
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:17,162
Love's young nightmare-like.

453
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:19,294
Violence makes violence.

454
00:45:19,598 --> 00:45:21,589
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

455
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:26,400
This is the end of the line for me.

456
00:45:26,605 --> 00:45:29,768
The end of the line, yes.

457
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:31,598
And what of me, brother sir?

458
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,505
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

459
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:35,770
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

460
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:38,915
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

461
00:45:39,117 --> 00:45:42,416
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

462
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:44,486
It was all their idea, brothers.

463
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:47,419
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

464
00:45:54,132 --> 00:45:56,828
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

465
00:45:57,603 --> 00:45:58,831
A murderer.

466
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:01,696
Not true, sir.

467
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,737
It was only a slight tolchok.

468
00:46:03,942 --> 00:46:06,502
She were breathing, I swear it.

469
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:09,140
I've just come from the hospital.

470
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:11,712
Your victim has died.

471
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,147
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

472
00:46:15,354 --> 00:46:17,345
This is some new form of torture.

473
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:20,854
-Say it, brother sir.
-It'll be your own torture.

474
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:24,959
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

475
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:29,859
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

476
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:31,864
We'll hold him down.

477
00:46:32,638 --> 00:46:35,835
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

478
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,899
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning...

479
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,402
... O my brothers and only friends.

480
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,110
After a trial,
with judges and a jury...

481
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:18,611
...and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...

482
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:23,013
...he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F...

483
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:26,782
...among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

484
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:30,892
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers...

485
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:33,428
...against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

486
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:36,896
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...

487
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:39,535
...at her only child
and son of her bosom...

488
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:42,399
...like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.

489
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:45,542
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

490
00:47:44,242 --> 00:47:45,243
One up from Thames, sir.

491
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:48,204
Right! Open up the cell!

492
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:49,846
Yes, sir.

493
00:48:06,164 --> 00:48:08,428
Good morning, sir. Here are
the prisoner's committal forms.

494
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,157
Thank you, mister.

495
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,466
-Name?
-Alexander DeLarge.

496
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:16,673
You are now in H. M. Prison Parkmoor.

497
00:48:16,975 --> 00:48:20,467
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir. "

498
00:48:20,746 --> 00:48:21,576
Name?

499
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,146
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

500
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:25,438
Sentence?

501
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:26,877
14 years, sir.

502
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:27,982
Crime?

503
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:29,378
Murder, sir.

504
00:48:29,688 --> 00:48:32,589
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

505
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,302
You are now 655321.

506
00:48:46,605 --> 00:48:49,802
It is your duty to memorize that number.

507
00:48:50,108 --> 00:48:52,099
Thank you, mister. Well done.

508
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:54,106
-Thank you.
-Let the officer out.

509
00:48:58,383 --> 00:49:00,874
All right, empty your pockets.

510
00:49:04,623 --> 00:49:07,717
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor...

511
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:09,324
...directly behind you...

512
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:10,893
... 655321?

513
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,493
Yes, sir.

514
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,320
Then your toes belong...

515
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:17,024
...on the other side of it!

516
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:25,737
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

517
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:27,509
Carry on.

518
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,317
Pick that up...

519
00:49:33,552 --> 00:49:36,316
...and put it down properly.

520
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:49,158
One half-bar of chocolate.

521
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:54,070
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

522
00:49:57,175 --> 00:49:59,075
One packet of cigarettes.

523
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,373
Two plastic ball pens.

524
00:50:04,683 --> 00:50:06,742
One black, one red.

525
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:13,186
One pocket comb, black plastic.

526
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:18,253
One address book, imitation red leather.

527
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:28,973
One ten-penny piece.

528
00:50:30,408 --> 00:50:33,002
One white metal wristlet watch...

529
00:50:33,311 --> 00:50:37,270
...Timawrist, on a white metal expanding bracelet.

530
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,384
Anything else in your pockets?

531
00:50:41,419 --> 00:50:42,909
-No, sir.
-Right.

532
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:46,281
Sign here for your valuable property.

533
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,226
The tobacco and chocolate you brought in...

534
00:50:57,435 --> 00:50:58,732
...you lose that...

535
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,131
...as you are now convicted.

536
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:05,238
Now over to the table and get undressed.

537
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,241
Were you in police custody this morning?

538
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:15,952
-Yes, sir.
-One jacket, blue pinstriped.

539
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:17,312
Prison custody?

540
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:18,648
Yes, sir, on remand.

541
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:20,757
-One necktie, blue.
-Religion?

542
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,051
C. of E., sir.

543
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:24,022
Do you mean the Church of England?

544
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:26,025
Yes, sir.
The Church of England, sir.

545
00:51:26,264 --> 00:51:27,253
Brown hair, isn't it?

546
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:28,659
Fair hair, sir.

547
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:29,958
Blue eyes?

548
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:31,567
Blue, sir.

549
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:34,431
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

550
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:35,537
No, sir.

551
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:37,674
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

552
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:41,673
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

553
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,471
-No, sir.
-One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

554
00:51:44,783 --> 00:51:47,274
-Have you ever had any mental illness?
-No, sir.

555
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:51,383
-Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?
-No, sir.

556
00:51:51,857 --> 00:51:53,882
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

557
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,492
-Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?
-No, sir.

558
00:51:57,696 --> 00:51:59,288
One pair of socks, black.

559
00:51:59,497 --> 00:52:01,294
-Are you an epileptic?
-No, sir.

560
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:04,057
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

561
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:07,999
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

562
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:09,303
-No, sir.
-Right.

563
00:52:09,574 --> 00:52:12,099
-The mothballs, mister.
-Mothballs, sir.

564
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,478
Now then, face the wall...

565
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,508
... bend over and touch your toes.

566
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:25,680
-Any venereal disease?
-No, sir.

567
00:52:25,924 --> 00:52:27,482
-Crabs?
-No, sir.
-Lice?
-No, sir.

568
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:30,718
-Through there for the bath.
-Yes, sir.
-One for a bath.

569
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:34,028
What's it going to be, eh?

570
00:52:34,933 --> 00:52:38,425
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this...

571
00:52:38,637 --> 00:52:40,628
...though more in than out
for most of you?

572
00:52:40,906 --> 00:52:45,002
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word...

573
00:52:45,243 --> 00:52:48,940
...and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners...

574
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:51,340
...in the next world
as well as this?

575
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:53,608
And what idiots you are...

576
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:58,516
...selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

577
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:00,452
The thrill of theft.

578
00:53:00,759 --> 00:53:01,555
Of violence.

579
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,456
The urge to live easy.

580
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:07,357
Well, I ask you what is it worth...

581
00:53:07,632 --> 00:53:10,032
...when we have undeniable proof...

582
00:53:10,268 --> 00:53:13,362
...yes, incontrovertible
evidence...

583
00:53:13,571 --> 00:53:14,936
...that hell exists?

584
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:16,367
I know!

585
00:53:16,675 --> 00:53:19,166
I know, my friends.

586
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:21,537
I have been informed...

587
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,270
...in visions...

588
00:53:23,548 --> 00:53:25,038
...that there is a place...

589
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,650
...darker than any prison...

590
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:31,980
... hotter than any flame
of human fire...

591
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:33,554
...where souls...

592
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:37,990
...of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves--

593
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:43,595
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

594
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:46,794
I say, like yourselves...

595
00:53:47,305 --> 00:53:48,670
...scream...

596
00:53:49,074 --> 00:53:52,703
...in endless and
unendurable agony.

597
00:53:53,478 --> 00:53:54,809
Their skin...

598
00:53:55,113 --> 00:53:57,604
... rotting and peeling.

599
00:53:57,816 --> 00:53:59,613
A fireball...

600
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:02,184
...spinning in their
screaming guts!

601
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,821
I know. Yes, I know!

602
00:54:06,624 --> 00:54:08,615
Silence!

603
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,618
Listen to the priest!

604
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,122
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...

605
00:54:15,433 --> 00:54:16,730
...in the prisoner's hymnal.

606
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:20,199
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

607
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,139
I was a wandering sheep

608
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:28,839
-Sing up, damn you!
-I did not love the fold

609
00:54:29,114 --> 00:54:30,513
Louder!

610
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:37,845
I did not love my shepherd's voice

611
00:54:38,456 --> 00:54:42,859
I would not be controlled

612
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:45,121
Louder!

613
00:54:45,563 --> 00:54:48,623
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

614
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:52,769
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

615
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:56,166
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...

616
00:54:56,374 --> 00:54:59,366
...and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...

617
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:01,168
...ready to dribble all over...

618
00:55:01,379 --> 00:55:04,348
...a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

619
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:11,845
It was my rabbit...

620
00:55:12,157 --> 00:55:14,853
... to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.

621
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:18,153
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

622
00:55:18,396 --> 00:55:21,490
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...

623
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:25,100
...and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

624
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:50,024
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

625
00:55:50,295 --> 00:55:52,195
And I could viddy myself
helping in...

626
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,389
...and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

627
00:55:56,634 --> 00:55:59,933
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

628
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:14,407
I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book...

629
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:16,813
... which is more like
all preachy talking...

630
00:56:17,122 --> 00:56:19,215
... than fighting
and the old in-out.

631
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:22,551
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...

632
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:25,057
...and then drink
their Hebrew vino...

633
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:28,557
...and getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.

634
00:56:28,766 --> 00:56:30,757
That kept me going.

635
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:05,000
"Seek not to be like evil men.

636
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,597
Neither desire to be with them...

637
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:10,968
... because their minds
studieth robberies...

638
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:14,110
...and their lips speak deceits. "

639
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:17,815
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

640
00:57:18,116 --> 00:57:20,380
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

641
00:57:20,618 --> 00:57:22,279
Fine, my son. Fine.

642
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,817
Father?

643
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:29,520
I have tried, have I not?

644
00:57:29,827 --> 00:57:30,919
You have, my son.

645
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:33,494
-I've done my best, have I not?
-Indeed.

646
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:37,132
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

647
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:41,704
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

648
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,841
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

649
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:46,340
Father...

650
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:50,643
...can I ask you
a question in private?

651
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,150
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

652
00:58:04,362 --> 00:58:06,853
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

653
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:12,332
Don't be shy to speak up.

654
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:16,170
Remember...

655
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:18,365
... I know of the...

656
00:58:18,576 --> 00:58:22,444
... urges that can
trouble young men...

657
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,238
...deprived...

658
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:26,440
...of the society of women.

659
00:58:29,354 --> 00:58:31,686
It's nothing like that, Father.

660
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:38,794
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

661
00:58:39,364 --> 00:58:40,991
About this new treatment.

662
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:43,598
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

663
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:46,392
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

664
00:58:47,272 --> 00:58:49,467
Where did you hear about this?

665
00:58:49,707 --> 00:58:52,403
Who's been talking
about these things?

666
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,110
These things get around.

667
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,610
Two warders talk, as it might be.

668
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,908
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

669
00:59:01,419 --> 00:59:04,820
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

670
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:07,717
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

671
00:59:10,628 --> 00:59:14,325
How about putting me in
for this new treatment, Father?

672
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:19,630
I take it you are referring...

673
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:22,134
...to the Ludovico technique.

674
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:25,239
I don't know what it's called, Father.

675
00:59:25,443 --> 00:59:27,343
All I know is that it
gets you out quickly...

676
00:59:27,645 --> 00:59:30,113
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

677
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:33,648
That is not proven, 655321.

678
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:38,047
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

679
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:41,321
It has been used, hasn't it?

680
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:44,324
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

681
00:59:44,562 --> 00:59:46,962
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

682
00:59:47,265 --> 00:59:50,962
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

683
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:55,838
I don't care about the dangers.

684
00:59:57,475 --> 00:59:59,670
I just want to be good.

685
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:03,573
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

686
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:05,941
...one act of goodness.

687
01:00:06,184 --> 01:00:07,651
The question is...

688
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:12,682
...whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

689
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:15,857
Goodness comes from within.

690
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,186
Goodness...

691
01:00:17,462 --> 01:00:18,793
...is chosen.

692
01:00:19,197 --> 01:00:21,290
When a man cannot choose...

693
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:23,693
... he ceases to be a man.

694
01:00:25,503 --> 01:00:30,463
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

695
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:34,578
I only know I want to be good.

696
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:38,614
Be patient, my son.

697
01:00:38,816 --> 01:00:41,080
Put your trust in the Lord.

698
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:46,582
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee...

699
01:00:46,824 --> 01:00:49,725
...and shall give delight
to thy soul.

700
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:51,590
Amen.

701
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:21,358
-Mister!
-All present and correct, sir!

702
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:22,617
Right!

703
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:26,253
All present and correct, sir!

704
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:23,409
Prisoners, halt!

705
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:25,580
Now pay attention!

706
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,087
I want you in two lines...

707
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,920
... up against that wall,
facing this way.

708
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:32,719
Go on, move!

709
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:34,229
Hurry up!

710
01:02:34,532 --> 01:02:35,794
Stop talking!

711
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:44,199
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

712
01:03:00,157 --> 01:03:01,351
How many to a cell?

713
01:03:01,659 --> 01:03:03,456
Four in this block, sir.

714
01:03:04,362 --> 01:03:06,660
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

715
01:03:06,864 --> 01:03:10,027
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

716
01:03:10,268 --> 01:03:13,965
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

717
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:16,036
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

718
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,572
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

719
01:03:18,843 --> 01:03:20,538
...with outmoded
penalogical theories.

720
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:24,474
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

721
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:28,243
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

722
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:31,181
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

723
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:33,684
Full implementation
in a year's time.

724
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:36,186
Punishment means nothing to them.
You can see that.

725
01:03:36,394 --> 01:03:39,363
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

726
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:40,756
You're absolutely right, sir.

727
01:03:40,998 --> 01:03:43,592
Shut your bleeding hole!

728
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:45,758
Who said that?

729
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:47,803
I did, sir.

730
01:03:54,078 --> 01:03:55,773
What crime did you commit?

731
01:03:56,013 --> 01:03:58,106
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

732
01:03:58,382 --> 01:04:01,078
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

733
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:02,911
Fourteen years, sir.

734
01:04:04,221 --> 01:04:05,415
Excellent.

735
01:04:06,924 --> 01:04:08,186
He's enterprising...

736
01:04:08,392 --> 01:04:09,416
...aggressive...

737
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,887
...outgoing...

738
01:04:11,128 --> 01:04:11,924
...young...

739
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:13,526
... bold...

740
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:15,289
...vicious.

741
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:16,791
He'll do.

742
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:18,194
Fine.

743
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:19,926
We could still look at C-block.

744
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,229
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

745
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,203
I want his records sent to me.

746
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:25,739
This vicious young hoodlum...

747
01:04:26,043 --> 01:04:27,943
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

748
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:30,203
Thank you very much
for this chance, sir.

749
01:04:30,414 --> 01:04:33,212
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

750
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:35,942
-Shall we go to my office?
-Thank you.

751
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,057
Come in.

752
01:04:45,863 --> 01:04:46,761
Sir!

753
01:04:46,964 --> 01:04:48,864
655321. Sir!

754
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:50,055
Very good, Chief.

755
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:51,858
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

756
01:04:52,169 --> 01:04:54,637
Full name and number
to the governor.

757
01:04:55,473 --> 01:04:58,670
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

758
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:04,473
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

759
01:05:04,749 --> 01:05:08,344
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

760
01:05:08,653 --> 01:05:10,587
The new Minister of the Interior.

761
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:13,756
What they call a very new broom.

762
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:18,360
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

763
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:20,893
And orders are orders...

764
01:05:21,165 --> 01:05:24,692
...though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

765
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:27,199
An eye for an eye, I say.

766
01:05:27,505 --> 01:05:30,474
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

767
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:34,405
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans...

768
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:36,408
... not hit back also?

769
01:05:37,314 --> 01:05:39,282
The new view is to say " no. "

770
01:05:39,517 --> 01:05:42,884
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

771
01:05:43,187 --> 01:05:46,179
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

772
01:05:46,524 --> 01:05:49,015
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

773
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,722
You are to be reformed.

774
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,021
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

775
01:05:55,332 --> 01:05:56,890
You will be leaving here.

776
01:05:57,134 --> 01:06:01,400
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

777
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:05,642
It's believed you'll be able to
leave state custody in a fortnight.

778
01:06:05,843 --> 01:06:07,743
I suppose that prospect pleases you?

779
01:06:08,045 --> 01:06:09,808
Answer the governor's question!

780
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,412
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

781
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:13,947
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

782
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:16,446
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

783
01:06:18,723 --> 01:06:21,055
Sign this where it's marked.

784
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:26,320
Don't read it, sign it!

785
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:30,261
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted...

786
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:33,469
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

787
01:06:33,738 --> 01:06:35,069
And this.

788
01:06:42,246 --> 01:06:43,838
And another copy.

789
01:06:56,393 --> 01:06:58,258
The next morning I was taken to...

790
01:06:58,462 --> 01:07:00,191
... the Ludovico medical facility...

791
01:07:00,397 --> 01:07:02,262
... outside the town center.

792
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,967
I felt a malenky bit sad...

793
01:07:04,268 --> 01:07:06,099
...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...

794
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:09,702
...as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

795
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:11,898
Right, halt the prisoner.

796
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,815
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

797
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:21,880
I've got 655321...

798
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,782
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

799
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:28,717
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

800
01:07:28,926 --> 01:07:30,223
I'm Dr. Alcot.

801
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,519
Dr. Alcot.

802
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:35,129
Very good, sir.

803
01:07:38,936 --> 01:07:41,996
-Are you prepared for the prisoner?
-Yes, of course.

804
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,300
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

805
01:07:47,144 --> 01:07:48,543
There, sir.

806
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:01,457
And there, sir.

807
01:08:06,964 --> 01:08:08,454
And there.

808
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:28,975
There you are.

809
01:08:31,155 --> 01:08:33,055
Prison escort, move forward!

810
01:08:36,193 --> 01:08:37,353
Halt!

811
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:41,158
Excuse me, sir.

812
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:50,970
Is that the officer who will
take charge of the prisoner?

813
01:09:00,517 --> 01:09:04,009
A word of advice, Doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

814
01:09:04,321 --> 01:09:07,813
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

815
01:09:08,025 --> 01:09:11,222
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

816
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:15,124
We can manage things. Charlie, will
you show the young man to his room, now?

817
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:18,129
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

818
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,505
-Morning, Charlie.
-Good morning, Doctor.

819
01:09:30,748 --> 01:09:31,737
Good morning, Alex.

820
01:09:32,049 --> 01:09:34,711
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

821
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:36,511
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day, isn't it?

822
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:38,016
Indeed, it is.

823
01:09:38,255 --> 01:09:39,847
May I take that?

824
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:46,018
-How are you feeling this morning?
-Fine, fine.

825
01:09:46,263 --> 01:09:49,255
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

826
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:50,763
...and begin your treatment.

827
01:09:51,368 --> 01:09:53,859
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

828
01:09:55,773 --> 01:09:58,367
I realize that,
and I'm very grateful.

829
01:09:58,742 --> 01:10:00,767
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

830
01:10:01,078 --> 01:10:02,375
I hope so, missus.

831
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:07,983
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

832
01:10:08,185 --> 01:10:09,482
Nothing of the sort.

833
01:10:09,954 --> 01:10:12,650
-Vitamins will it be, then?
-Something like that.

834
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:17,092
You're undernourished, so after
each meal we'll give you a shot.

835
01:10:17,394 --> 01:10:18,793
Roll over on your right side.

836
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:21,894
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

837
01:10:31,909 --> 01:10:34,901
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

838
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,811
It's quite simple, really.

839
01:10:38,415 --> 01:10:40,178
We're going to show you some films.

840
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:42,783
You mean like
going to the pictures?

841
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,812
Something like that.

842
01:10:45,122 --> 01:10:45,918
That's good.

843
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,988
I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

844
01:10:51,028 --> 01:10:53,496
And viddy films I would.

845
01:10:53,998 --> 01:10:55,989
Where I was taken to, brothers...

846
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,327
... was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

847
01:10:58,802 --> 01:11:00,929
I was bound up
in a straitjacket...

848
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:03,332
...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...

849
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,938
... with wires running away from it.

850
01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:08,509
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...

851
01:11:08,712 --> 01:11:12,148
...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

852
01:11:12,449 --> 01:11:14,144
It seemed a bit crazy to me...

853
01:11:14,451 --> 01:11:17,318
...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

854
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:20,955
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...

855
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:24,616
...I would put up with much
in the meantime, O my brothers.

856
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:53,386
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...

857
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,590
...like it was done in Hollywood.

858
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:57,986
The sounds were real horrorshow.

859
01:11:58,195 --> 01:12:01,392
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

860
01:12:01,665 --> 01:12:03,895
You could even get
the breathing and panting...

861
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:07,170
... of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

862
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:09,269
And then what do you know?

863
01:12:09,506 --> 01:12:11,667
Soon our dear old friend...

864
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:13,900
... the red, red vino on tap...

865
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:15,304
... the same in all places...

866
01:12:15,512 --> 01:12:17,002
...like it's put out
by the same firm...

867
01:12:17,581 --> 01:12:19,208
...began to flow.

868
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:21,577
It was beautiful.

869
01:12:21,919 --> 01:12:24,217
It's funny how the colors
of the real world...

870
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:26,518
... only seem really real...

871
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,917
... when you viddy them
on a screen.

872
01:12:31,929 --> 01:12:34,329
Now, all the time
I was watching this...

873
01:12:34,598 --> 01:12:36,828
...I was beginning
to get very aware...

874
01:12:37,134 --> 01:12:39,295
... of, like, not feeling
all that well.

875
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:43,438
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

876
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,940
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...

877
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:50,907
... which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...

878
01:12:51,148 --> 01:12:53,946
... who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...

879
01:12:54,918 --> 01:12:56,943
... first by one malchick...

880
01:12:57,821 --> 01:12:58,947
... then another.

881
01:13:00,057 --> 01:13:01,547
Then another.

882
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:06,961
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...

883
01:13:07,264 --> 01:13:10,722
...leering and smecking
and then going into it...

884
01:13:10,968 --> 01:13:14,165
...I began to feel really sick.

885
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:17,262
But I could not shut me glazzies.

886
01:13:17,574 --> 01:13:20,975
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...

887
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:23,236
...I still could not get out of...

888
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,176
... the line of fire
of this picture.

889
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:30,478
Get me up.

890
01:13:30,854 --> 01:13:32,651
I'm going to be sick.

891
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:35,682
Get something for me to be sick in!

892
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:42,864
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

893
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,295
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

894
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:49,402
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

895
01:13:50,307 --> 01:13:54,107
One of our early test subjects
described it as being like death.

896
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:57,303
A sense of stifling or drowning.

897
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,711
And it is during this period,
we have found...

898
01:14:00,984 --> 01:14:04,613
...the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

899
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:08,621
... between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

900
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:11,884
...and the violence he sees.

901
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:15,688
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

902
01:14:15,999 --> 01:14:18,331
You've made
a very positive response.

903
01:14:19,436 --> 01:14:23,338
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

904
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,634
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

905
01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:30,006
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

906
01:14:30,247 --> 01:14:33,546
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

907
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:34,908
It was horrible.

908
01:14:35,152 --> 01:14:36,710
Of course it was horrible.

909
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:39,354
Violence is a very horrible thing.

910
01:14:39,656 --> 01:14:41,351
That's what you're learning now.

911
01:14:41,558 --> 01:14:42,855
Your body's learning it.

912
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:46,224
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

913
01:14:46,463 --> 01:14:49,728
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

914
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,868
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow.

915
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:57,262
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

916
01:14:57,541 --> 01:15:00,669
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful...

917
01:15:00,944 --> 01:15:02,935
...with fear and nausea.

918
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:05,375
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

919
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:07,482
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

920
01:16:01,305 --> 01:16:03,330
It was the next day, brothers...

921
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,098
...and I had truly done my best...

922
01:16:05,342 --> 01:16:07,742
...morning and afternoon
to play it their way...

923
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:10,843
...and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick...

924
01:16:11,048 --> 01:16:12,606
...in the chair of torture...

925
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:17,047
... while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...

926
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:22,015
... though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

927
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:25,553
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness...

928
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:29,731
... what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

929
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:33,158
It was Ludwig van.

930
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:36,230
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

931
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:54,982
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

932
01:16:55,492 --> 01:16:56,686
It's a sin!

933
01:16:57,094 --> 01:16:58,686
It's a sin!

934
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:05,259
Sin?

935
01:17:05,502 --> 01:17:07,094
What's all this about sin?

936
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:08,502
That!

937
01:17:08,705 --> 01:17:12,698
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

938
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:15,409
Beethoven just wrote music.

939
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:19,276
Are you referring
to the background score?

940
01:17:20,817 --> 01:17:22,785
You've heard Beethoven before?

941
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:26,889
So you're keen on music?

942
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:34,026
Can't be helped.

943
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:37,529
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

944
01:17:38,535 --> 01:17:40,696
The governor ought to be pleased.

945
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,408
I'm sorry, Alex.

946
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:47,404
This is for your own good.

947
01:17:47,644 --> 01:17:50,044
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

948
01:17:50,847 --> 01:17:54,544
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I should feel ill...

949
01:17:54,751 --> 01:17:57,720
...when I hear lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.

950
01:17:58,255 --> 01:18:00,553
You must take your chance, boy.

951
01:18:01,057 --> 01:18:03,548
The choice has been all yours.

952
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:07,757
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

953
01:18:08,131 --> 01:18:11,066
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing...

954
01:18:11,334 --> 01:18:14,565
...is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

955
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:16,768
I've learned me lesson, sir.

956
01:18:16,973 --> 01:18:19,874
I see now what I've
never seen before.

957
01:18:20,143 --> 01:18:23,078
I'm cured. Praise God!

958
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,780
You're not cured yet, boy.

959
01:18:26,683 --> 01:18:28,150
But, sirs.

960
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:29,750
Missus!

961
01:18:30,086 --> 01:18:32,179
I see that it's wrong!

962
01:18:32,456 --> 01:18:36,483
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

963
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:39,387
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy...

964
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:42,461
...without being
tolchocked and knifed!

965
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:45,792
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

966
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:47,694
But be cheerful about it.

967
01:18:48,004 --> 01:18:51,269
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

968
01:19:29,646 --> 01:19:30,908
Ladies and gentlemen...

969
01:19:31,147 --> 01:19:34,048
...at this stage, we introduce
the subject himself.

970
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:37,220
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

971
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:40,354
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast...

972
01:19:40,557 --> 01:19:41,546
... undrugged...

973
01:19:41,825 --> 01:19:43,656
... unhypnotized.

974
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:47,557
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again...

975
01:19:47,831 --> 01:19:51,460
...as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

976
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:55,033
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

977
01:19:55,272 --> 01:19:57,672
From the hoodlum the state committed...

978
01:19:57,874 --> 01:20:00,672
...to unprofitable punishment two years ago.

979
01:20:00,877 --> 01:20:03,675
Unchanged after two years.

980
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:06,576
Unchanged, do I say?

981
01:20:06,883 --> 01:20:08,350
Not quite.

982
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:13,284
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

983
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:16,889
The fawning, greased, obsequious leer.

984
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,191
Other vices it taught him...

985
01:20:19,462 --> 01:20:23,364
...as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

986
01:20:24,568 --> 01:20:27,594
Our party promised
to restore law and order...

987
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:31,898
...and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

988
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:36,201
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

989
01:20:36,413 --> 01:20:40,110
Ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic moment.

990
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:44,911
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

991
01:20:45,922 --> 01:20:47,822
But enough of words.

992
01:20:48,124 --> 01:20:50,319
Actions speak louder than.

993
01:20:50,594 --> 01:20:52,289
Action now.

994
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:54,720
Observe all.

995
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:06,935
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

996
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:09,236
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

997
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:12,640
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

998
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:24,157
Hello, heap of dirt.

999
01:21:26,963 --> 01:21:31,263
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horrible smell.

1000
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:34,269
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

1001
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:37,167
He had a shower this morning.

1002
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:39,666
You trying to call me a liar?

1003
01:21:39,976 --> 01:21:40,772
No, brother.

1004
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:44,271
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

1005
01:21:49,953 --> 01:21:51,784
Why did you do that, brother?

1006
01:21:51,988 --> 01:21:53,956
I've never done wrong to you.

1007
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:56,283
You want to know why I did that?

1008
01:21:56,693 --> 01:21:57,682
Well, you see...

1009
01:21:57,994 --> 01:21:59,188
... I do this...

1010
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:00,690
...and that...

1011
01:22:00,997 --> 01:22:04,194
...and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

1012
01:22:04,401 --> 01:22:06,699
And if you want to start something...

1013
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:09,494
...you just go ahead.
Go on!

1014
01:22:09,706 --> 01:22:10,968
Please do!

1015
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:14,406
I'm going to be sick.

1016
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:16,906
You're going to be sick, are you?

1017
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,580
I'm going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

1018
01:22:20,316 --> 01:22:21,908
You want to get up?

1019
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:24,013
Well, now you listen to me.

1020
01:22:24,721 --> 01:22:26,313
If you want to get up...

1021
01:22:26,823 --> 01:22:28,723
...you've got to do something for me.

1022
01:22:29,492 --> 01:22:30,618
Here.

1023
01:22:31,127 --> 01:22:32,321
Here.

1024
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:34,623
You see that?

1025
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:37,099
You see that shoe?

1026
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:39,900
I want you to lick it.

1027
01:22:40,136 --> 01:22:41,433
Go on!

1028
01:22:42,505 --> 01:22:43,995
Lick it!

1029
01:22:47,043 --> 01:22:49,409
And, O my brothers, would you believe...

1030
01:22:49,646 --> 01:22:53,013
... your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator...

1031
01:22:53,249 --> 01:22:55,615
...pushed out his red yabzick a mile and a half...

1032
01:22:55,852 --> 01:22:58,719
... to lick the grahzny, vonny boots.

1033
01:22:59,522 --> 01:23:00,546
And again!

1034
01:23:00,757 --> 01:23:03,225
The horrible killing sickness had whooshed up...

1035
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,052
...and turned the joy of battle...

1036
01:23:05,862 --> 01:23:08,524
...into a feeling I was going to snuff it.

1037
01:23:08,765 --> 01:23:10,062
And again.

1038
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:12,558
Nice and clean.

1039
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:16,364
Thank you very much.

1040
01:23:16,573 --> 01:23:18,438
That will do very well.

1041
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:24,943
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

1042
01:24:35,451 --> 01:24:37,112
She came towards me...

1043
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:41,119
... with the light, like it was the
light of heavenly grace.

1044
01:24:41,357 --> 01:24:43,552
And the thing that flashed in me gulliver...

1045
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:46,454
... was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor...

1046
01:24:46,663 --> 01:24:49,962
... with the old in-out, real savage.

1047
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:08,382
But quick as a shot came the sickness.

1048
01:25:08,685 --> 01:25:11,176
Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner...

1049
01:25:11,988 --> 01:25:14,684
...and now followed to make his arrest.

1050
01:25:27,804 --> 01:25:28,702
Enough!

1051
01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:30,700
Thank you very much.

1052
01:25:30,907 --> 01:25:32,704
Thank you, my dear.

1053
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,192
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1054
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,898
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

1055
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:02,037
-Good.
-Was it all right, sir?

1056
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:03,102
Did I do well?

1057
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:06,706
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

1058
01:26:06,943 --> 01:26:08,205
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

1059
01:26:08,444 --> 01:26:10,912
...our subject is impelled towards the good...

1060
01:26:11,214 --> 01:26:14,809
... by paradoxically being impelled towards evil.

1061
01:26:15,118 --> 01:26:16,745
The intention to act violently...

1062
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:20,454
...is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

1063
01:26:20,723 --> 01:26:23,351
To counter these,
the subject has to switch...

1064
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:26,561
...to a diametrically opposed attitude.

1065
01:26:27,263 --> 01:26:28,628
Any questions?

1066
01:26:28,865 --> 01:26:30,264
Choice!

1067
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:37,262
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1068
01:26:37,473 --> 01:26:39,065
Self-interest.

1069
01:26:39,342 --> 01:26:41,173
The fear of physical pain...

1070
01:26:41,444 --> 01:26:45,972
...drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement.

1071
01:26:46,749 --> 01:26:48,774
Its insincerity was clearly to be seen.

1072
01:26:48,985 --> 01:26:50,885
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1073
01:26:51,154 --> 01:26:55,750
He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.

1074
01:26:55,992 --> 01:26:58,290
Padre, these are subtleties.

1075
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:01,688
We're not concerned with motives, with the higher ethics.

1076
01:27:01,998 --> 01:27:05,695
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

1077
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:12,601
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

1078
01:27:13,109 --> 01:27:15,600
He will be your true Christian...

1079
01:27:15,878 --> 01:27:17,971
...ready to turn the other cheek.

1080
01:27:18,181 --> 01:27:21,207
Ready to be crucified, rather than crucify.

1081
01:27:21,417 --> 01:27:25,513
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

1082
01:27:25,822 --> 01:27:27,187
Reclamation.

1083
01:27:27,423 --> 01:27:29,618
Joy before the angels of God.

1084
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:33,020
The point is that it works!

1085
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,733
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator...

1086
01:27:41,004 --> 01:27:43,029
... was a free man.

1087
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:54,940
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper and keep him company.

1088
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:59,040
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper and live by the sight of the sea.

1089
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,740
I'll polish his lamp by the light of day,
so ships at night can find their way.

1090
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:09,140
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper and won't that be OK?

1091
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:14,240
We'll have parties on the coral reef and clambakes on the shore.

1092
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,540
We'll invite the neighbors in, seagulls by the score.

1093
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:23,540
I dream of live in a lighthouse baby every single day.

1094
01:28:21,444 --> 01:28:22,877
Son!

1095
01:28:24,447 --> 01:28:26,779
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1096
01:28:28,084 --> 01:28:29,346
Mum.

1097
01:28:31,087 --> 01:28:33,487
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

1098
01:28:35,191 --> 01:28:37,489
-Dad.
-Lad. What a surprise.

1099
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,853
-Good to see you.
-Keeping fit?

1100
01:28:40,596 --> 01:28:41,858
How are you, then?

1101
01:28:42,098 --> 01:28:44,191
I'm fine, fine.

1102
01:28:44,467 --> 01:28:46,401
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

1103
01:28:49,205 --> 01:28:50,900
I'm back!

1104
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:54,598
Good to see you.

1105
01:28:54,911 --> 01:28:58,074
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

1106
01:28:58,414 --> 01:29:01,508
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1107
01:29:01,818 --> 01:29:04,719
It's a surprise, all right.
A bit bewildering too.

1108
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:07,788
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

1109
01:29:08,024 --> 01:29:09,821
You should have let us know, lad.

1110
01:29:10,493 --> 01:29:14,429
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all...

1111
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:16,129
...cured too, eh?

1112
01:29:16,432 --> 01:29:18,491
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

1113
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:21,395
I'm completely reformed.

1114
01:29:25,108 --> 01:29:26,803
Still the same old place, then?

1115
01:29:39,322 --> 01:29:42,155
There's a strange fellow
sitting on the sofa...

1116
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:45,519
... munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

1117
01:29:48,531 --> 01:29:50,328
That's Joe.

1118
01:29:52,268 --> 01:29:54,168
He lives here now.

1119
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:55,767
The lodger.

1120
01:29:56,038 --> 01:29:57,665
That's what he is.

1121
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,031
He rents your room.

1122
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:12,176
How do you do, Joe?

1123
01:30:12,455 --> 01:30:14,480
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1124
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:16,681
No complaints?

1125
01:30:19,795 --> 01:30:21,660
I've heard about you.

1126
01:30:22,698 --> 01:30:24,461
I know what you've done.

1127
01:30:28,804 --> 01:30:32,467
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1128
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:35,205
So you're back, eh?

1129
01:30:35,478 --> 01:30:40,108
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

1130
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:41,883
Over my dead corpse, you will.

1131
01:30:42,185 --> 01:30:45,484
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them...

1132
01:30:45,688 --> 01:30:47,679
...than like a lodger.

1133
01:30:49,225 --> 01:30:51,819
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1134
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,531
Do put your hand over your mouth, please.

1135
01:30:59,835 --> 01:31:01,029
It's bloody revolting.

1136
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,134
Are you all right?

1137
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:11,006
It's the treatment.

1138
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:13,841
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1139
01:31:14,116 --> 01:31:17,916
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1140
01:31:20,022 --> 01:31:22,855
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1141
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:27,226
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1142
01:31:37,974 --> 01:31:41,068
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

1143
01:31:45,381 --> 01:31:48,145
That was all...

1144
01:31:48,384 --> 01:31:50,045
...took away, son.

1145
01:31:50,586 --> 01:31:52,383
By the police.

1146
01:31:52,788 --> 01:31:54,756
New regulation, see...

1147
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:58,051
...about compensation
for the victims.

1148
01:32:00,696 --> 01:32:02,391
What about Basil?

1149
01:32:05,401 --> 01:32:07,096
Where is my snake?

1150
01:32:17,413 --> 01:32:18,607
He met with...

1151
01:32:18,814 --> 01:32:20,611
...like, an accident.

1152
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,087
He passed away.

1153
01:32:31,427 --> 01:32:33,520
What's going to happen to me, then?

1154
01:32:35,798 --> 01:32:37,026
I mean...

1155
01:32:38,134 --> 01:32:39,601
...that's my room he's in.

1156
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:41,700
There's no denying that.

1157
01:32:42,738 --> 01:32:45,332
This is my home also.

1158
01:32:47,243 --> 01:32:50,701
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1159
01:32:56,652 --> 01:32:59,212
All this needs thinking about, son.

1160
01:33:00,456 --> 01:33:03,323
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

1161
01:33:03,559 --> 01:33:05,356
Not just like that, can we?

1162
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:06,650
I mean...

1163
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:08,862
...Joe's here doing a job.

1164
01:33:09,165 --> 01:33:11,463
A contract it is.
Two years.

1165
01:33:11,667 --> 01:33:15,364
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1166
01:33:17,173 --> 01:33:19,141
You see, son...

1167
01:33:20,476 --> 01:33:23,968
...Joe's paid next month's
rent already...

1168
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:28,379
...so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say...

1169
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:31,643
...to Joe to get out, now can we?

1170
01:33:32,054 --> 01:33:33,885
No, but it's much more than that.

1171
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:37,190
I mean, I've got you two
to think of...

1172
01:33:37,493 --> 01:33:40,360
...who've been like
a father and mother to me.

1173
01:33:40,596 --> 01:33:43,588
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two...

1174
01:33:43,866 --> 01:33:46,699
...to the tender mercies
of this young monster...

1175
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:50,199
...who's been like no real son at all.

1176
01:33:50,906 --> 01:33:53,204
Look, he's weeping now.

1177
01:33:53,409 --> 01:33:56,401
But that's all his craft and artfulness.

1178
01:33:56,712 --> 01:33:59,510
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

1179
01:33:59,715 --> 01:34:04,015
Let him learn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy...

1180
01:34:04,286 --> 01:34:07,778
...doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1181
01:34:13,429 --> 01:34:14,726
All right.

1182
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:17,731
I know how things are now.

1183
01:34:19,235 --> 01:34:21,795
I've suffered and I've suffered...

1184
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:24,028
...and I've suffered.

1185
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,937
And everybody wants me to go on suffering.

1186
01:34:29,912 --> 01:34:32,039
You've made others suffer.

1187
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:35,745
It's only right that you should suffer proper.

1188
01:34:36,652 --> 01:34:38,313
I've been told everything you've done...

1189
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:40,545
...sitting around the family table.

1190
01:34:40,756 --> 01:34:43,850
And pretty shocking it was to listen to.

1191
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,957
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

1192
01:34:49,965 --> 01:34:53,526
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1193
01:34:53,769 --> 01:34:55,361
Come on. It's all right now.

1194
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:09,476
Right!

1195
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:11,947
I'm leaving now.

1196
01:35:12,188 --> 01:35:14,349
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1197
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:16,285
I'll make me own way.

1198
01:35:16,792 --> 01:35:20,387
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

1199
01:35:21,797 --> 01:35:24,698
Now don't take it like that, son.

1200
01:36:26,962 --> 01:36:29,931
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1201
01:36:31,767 --> 01:36:34,861
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1202
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:41,567
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1203
01:37:02,898 --> 01:37:04,388
Thanks, brother.

1204
01:37:22,318 --> 01:37:24,115
Jamey! Mack!

1205
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,087
May the hokey fly!

1206
01:37:26,422 --> 01:37:29,983
Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1207
01:37:31,627 --> 01:37:33,720
I never forget a face, me God!

1208
01:37:33,996 --> 01:37:35,395
I never forget any face.

1209
01:37:35,598 --> 01:37:38,396
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1210
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:42,092
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

1211
01:37:42,338 --> 01:37:43,498
Him and his friends.

1212
01:37:43,806 --> 01:37:46,639
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1213
01:37:46,942 --> 01:37:48,432
Stop him! Stop him!

1214
01:37:48,644 --> 01:37:52,603
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1215
01:37:52,848 --> 01:37:56,306
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men...

1216
01:37:56,452 --> 01:37:58,545
... trying to get at
your humble narrator...

1217
01:37:58,821 --> 01:38:02,518
... with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

1218
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:05,522
It was old age having a go at youth.

1219
01:38:06,261 --> 01:38:09,458
And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

1220
01:38:09,832 --> 01:38:11,823
It being better
to be hit at like that...

1221
01:38:12,034 --> 01:38:14,628
... than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

1222
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:16,269
All right, all right!

1223
01:38:16,538 --> 01:38:17,436
Stop it now!

1224
01:38:17,673 --> 01:38:21,040
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1225
01:38:21,343 --> 01:38:24,141
Back away! Go away with you!

1226
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:26,678
What's your trouble, sir?

1227
01:38:27,891 --> 01:38:30,682
Oh, no!

1228
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:35,688
Well!

1229
01:38:36,358 --> 01:38:38,792
Well, well, well!

1230
01:38:42,698 --> 01:38:45,292
If it isn't little Alex.

1231
01:38:45,501 --> 01:38:46,866
Long time no viddy, droog.

1232
01:38:47,102 --> 01:38:48,569
How goes?

1233
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:50,066
It's impossible.

1234
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:51,567
I don't believe it.

1235
01:38:51,807 --> 01:38:53,672
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1236
01:38:53,909 --> 01:38:55,706
Nothing up our sleeves.

1237
01:38:55,978 --> 01:38:58,003
No magic, little Alex.

1238
01:38:58,213 --> 01:39:01,705
A job for two who are now of job age.

1239
01:39:02,084 --> 01:39:03,517
The police.

1240
01:39:19,234 --> 01:39:20,428
Come on, Alex.

1241
01:39:20,736 --> 01:39:22,226
Come for walking.

1242
01:39:33,849 --> 01:39:36,249
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

1243
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:38,042
I just don't get this at all.

1244
01:39:38,253 --> 01:39:40,448
The old days are dead and gone.

1245
01:39:40,723 --> 01:39:43,556
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1246
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:45,520
I've been cured.

1247
01:39:45,761 --> 01:39:46,955
That was read out to us.

1248
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:49,060
The inspector read it all out to us.

1249
01:39:49,264 --> 01:39:52,028
He said it was a very good way.

1250
01:39:52,234 --> 01:39:53,462
But what is all this?

1251
01:39:53,769 --> 01:39:56,260
It was them that went for me, brothers.

1252
01:39:56,538 --> 01:39:59,166
You're not on their side, and can't be.

1253
01:39:59,775 --> 01:40:01,936
You can't be, Dim.

1254
01:40:02,177 --> 01:40:04,873
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days...

1255
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,572
...trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

1256
01:40:08,784 --> 01:40:10,251
A long time is right.

1257
01:40:10,486 --> 01:40:12,784
I don't remember them days too horrorshow.

1258
01:40:12,988 --> 01:40:15,081
And don't call me Dim no more, either.

1259
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:17,383
Officer, call me.

1260
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,196
Enough is remembered, though, little Alex.

1261
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:24,891
And this is to make sure you stay cured.

1262
01:41:20,856 --> 01:41:21,948
That's enough.

1263
01:41:22,224 --> 01:41:24,852
A bit more. He's still kicking.

1264
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,579
Cured, are you?

1265
01:41:47,182 --> 01:41:51,050
Be viddying you some more sometime, droogie.

1266
01:42:06,368 --> 01:42:10,304
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

1267
01:42:10,572 --> 01:42:12,802
I cried for meself.

1268
01:42:13,108 --> 01:42:15,906
Home, home, home.

1269
01:42:16,178 --> 01:42:18,009
It was home I was wanting.

1270
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:21,272
And it was home
I came to, brothers...

1271
01:42:21,516 --> 01:42:24,212
...not realizing,
in the state I was in...

1272
01:42:24,419 --> 01:42:27,411
... where I was
and had been before.

1273
01:43:15,637 --> 01:43:17,628
Who on earth could that be?

1274
01:43:33,188 --> 01:43:34,883
I'll see who it is.

1275
01:43:46,468 --> 01:43:47,992
Yes, what is it?

1276
01:43:56,678 --> 01:43:57,872
Please ...

1277
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:18,029
Frank, I think this young man needs some help.

1278
01:44:22,804 --> 01:44:24,203
My God!

1279
01:44:25,207 --> 01:44:27,402
What's happened to you, my boy?

1280
01:44:29,845 --> 01:44:33,542
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends...

1281
01:44:33,815 --> 01:44:36,045
... there was your faithful narrator...

1282
01:44:36,351 --> 01:44:38,751
...being held helpless like a babe in arms...

1283
01:44:39,021 --> 01:44:41,353
...and suddenly realizing where he was...

1284
01:44:41,656 --> 01:44:45,057
...and why "home" on the gate
had looked so familiar.

1285
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:47,056
But I knew I was safe.

1286
01:44:47,329 --> 01:44:49,354
I knew he would not remember me.

1287
01:44:49,564 --> 01:44:51,361
For in those carefree days...

1288
01:44:51,566 --> 01:44:53,466
...I and my so-called droogs...

1289
01:44:53,735 --> 01:44:57,227
... wore our maskies, which were
like real horrorshow disguises.

1290
01:44:58,573 --> 01:44:59,733
Police.

1291
01:45:03,378 --> 01:45:05,573
Ghastly, horrible police...

1292
01:45:07,582 --> 01:45:09,174
...they beat me up, sir.

1293
01:45:13,455 --> 01:45:15,855
The police beat me up.

1294
01:45:17,893 --> 01:45:19,588
I know you!

1295
01:45:23,799 --> 01:45:25,892
Isn't it your picture in the newspapers?

1296
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:28,396
Didn't I see you on the video this morning?

1297
01:45:28,603 --> 01:45:31,970
Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?

1298
01:45:32,274 --> 01:45:33,502
Yes, sir.

1299
01:45:34,009 --> 01:45:37,206
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

1300
01:45:37,412 --> 01:45:40,575
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1301
01:45:40,816 --> 01:45:43,910
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

1302
01:45:44,119 --> 01:45:48,613
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

1303
01:45:48,924 --> 01:45:51,791
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

1304
01:45:52,027 --> 01:45:53,426
But it's providential that you...

1305
01:45:53,728 --> 01:45:57,220
...who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

1306
01:45:59,134 --> 01:46:02,126
But you're cold and shivering.

1307
01:46:02,737 --> 01:46:04,102
Julian...

1308
01:46:04,339 --> 01:46:06,603
...draw a bath for this young man.

1309
01:46:06,842 --> 01:46:08,139
Certainly, Frank.

1310
01:46:08,543 --> 01:46:10,135
Thank you very much, sir.

1311
01:46:10,445 --> 01:46:12,037
God bless you, sir.

1312
01:47:07,002 --> 01:47:09,300
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable...

1313
01:47:09,504 --> 01:47:12,701
...to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

1314
01:47:12,974 --> 01:47:14,703
The government's big boast, sir...

1315
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,706
...is the way they have dealt with crime:

1316
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:19,810
Recruiting young roughs
into the police...

1317
01:47:20,015 --> 01:47:23,109
... proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1318
01:47:23,385 --> 01:47:25,580
We've seen it before
in other countries.

1319
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:27,310
The thin end of the wedge.

1320
01:47:27,522 --> 01:47:31,618
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1321
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:40,099
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

1322
01:47:40,335 --> 01:47:44,101
The people, the common people, must know, must see.

1323
01:47:44,339 --> 01:47:48,708
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. That tradition is all.

1324
01:47:48,944 --> 01:47:50,912
The common people will let it go, yes.

1325
01:47:51,146 --> 01:47:53,239
They'll sell liberty for a quieter life.

1326
01:47:53,548 --> 01:47:55,038
That is why they must be led.

1327
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:57,409
Driven. Pushed.

1328
01:48:02,457 --> 01:48:03,754
Fine.

1329
01:48:04,759 --> 01:48:06,420
Thank you very much, sir.

1330
01:48:08,463 --> 01:48:10,021
He'll be here.

1331
01:48:13,268 --> 01:48:16,567
I'm singing in the rain

1332
01:48:17,272 --> 01:48:20,264
Just singing in the rain

1333
01:48:21,076 --> 01:48:24,273
What a glorious feeling

1334
01:48:24,646 --> 01:48:28,047
I'm hap-hap-happy again

1335
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:31,746
I'm laughing at clouds

1336
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:35,079
So dark up above

1337
01:48:36,091 --> 01:48:38,582
The sun's in my heart

1338
01:48:39,394 --> 01:48:43,296
I'm ready for love

1339
01:48:44,266 --> 01:48:46,996
Let the stormy clouds chase

1340
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:50,469
Everyone from the place

1341
01:48:51,973 --> 01:48:56,910
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

1342
01:48:57,579 --> 01:49:00,571
I'll walk down the lane

1343
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:03,740
With a happy refrain

1344
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:11,040
And I'm singing

1345
01:49:34,816 --> 01:49:36,215
Good evening, sir.

1346
01:49:40,155 --> 01:49:41,713
Good evening.

1347
01:49:42,257 --> 01:49:45,124
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

1348
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,760
There was no one around, so I started.

1349
01:49:48,029 --> 01:49:49,860
Hope that's all right, sir.

1350
01:49:53,368 --> 01:49:55,063
Of course.

1351
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,298
Food all right?

1352
01:50:34,075 --> 01:50:35,702
Great, sir. Great.

1353
01:50:38,713 --> 01:50:40,908
Try the wine.

1354
01:50:47,322 --> 01:50:48,687
Thank you, sir.

1355
01:50:51,292 --> 01:50:52,520
Cheers.

1356
01:50:54,596 --> 01:50:55,790
Happy days.

1357
01:51:06,307 --> 01:51:08,639
Won't you join me?

1358
01:51:09,344 --> 01:51:11,539
No. My health doesn't allow it.

1359
01:51:12,414 --> 01:51:13,745
No, thank you.

1360
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:22,212
"1960, Chateau...

1361
01:51:22,724 --> 01:51:24,624
...Saint-Estephe.

1362
01:51:24,859 --> 01:51:25,723
Medoc."

1363
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:26,927
Very good brand, sir.

1364
01:51:35,637 --> 01:51:36,661
Very good...

1365
01:51:36,938 --> 01:51:38,132
...color, sir.

1366
01:51:42,343 --> 01:51:44,072
Smells nice too.

1367
01:51:58,993 --> 01:52:00,984
Very nice little number.

1368
01:52:02,263 --> 01:52:03,594
Here's to it.

1369
01:52:12,307 --> 01:52:14,798
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1370
01:52:15,109 --> 01:52:18,010
I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.

1371
01:52:19,113 --> 01:52:21,013
Have another glass.

1372
01:52:34,195 --> 01:52:35,526
My wife...

1373
01:52:36,998 --> 01:52:40,525
... used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

1374
01:52:43,438 --> 01:52:45,030
Your wife? Is she away?

1375
01:52:45,507 --> 01:52:47,839
She's dead!

1376
01:52:51,913 --> 01:52:53,744
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.

1377
01:52:54,048 --> 01:52:56,346
She was very badly raped, you see.

1378
01:52:56,651 --> 01:52:59,051
We were assaulted by vicious young hoodlums...

1379
01:52:59,254 --> 01:53:01,654
...in this very room you're sitting in now.

1380
01:53:01,856 --> 01:53:06,555
I was left a helpless cripple,
but for her the agony was too great.

1381
01:53:06,961 --> 01:53:08,826
The doctors said
it was pneumonia...

1382
01:53:09,063 --> 01:53:11,861
... because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

1383
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:16,364
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1384
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:21,040
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl!

1385
01:53:24,979 --> 01:53:26,571
And now you.

1386
01:53:27,181 --> 01:53:30,241
Another victim of the modern age.

1387
01:53:30,552 --> 01:53:32,452
But you can be helped.

1388
01:53:33,488 --> 01:53:36,889
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

1389
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:37,987
Some...

1390
01:53:38,259 --> 01:53:39,351
...friends?

1391
01:53:39,594 --> 01:53:41,084
Yes. They want to help you.

1392
01:53:41,396 --> 01:53:43,591
-Help me?
-Help you.

1393
01:53:43,898 --> 01:53:47,390
-Who are they?
-Very, very important people.

1394
01:53:47,602 --> 01:53:50,002
And they're interested in you.

1395
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:57,705
Julian. This'll be these people now.

1396
01:53:57,912 --> 01:54:01,313
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

1397
01:54:02,417 --> 01:54:04,385
No trouble at all.

1398
01:54:05,086 --> 01:54:06,280
Here.

1399
01:54:06,521 --> 01:54:08,421
Let me fill your glass.

1400
01:54:34,148 --> 01:54:35,843
So this is the young man.

1401
01:54:37,251 --> 01:54:38,718
How do you do, sir?

1402
01:54:39,053 --> 01:54:41,715
Missus.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1403
01:54:42,123 --> 01:54:44,557
I hope you forgive us for coming at this hour...

1404
01:54:44,826 --> 01:54:46,657
... but we heard you were in trouble...

1405
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:49,225
...and so we came over to see if we could help.

1406
01:54:49,464 --> 01:54:51,762
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1407
01:54:51,966 --> 01:54:54,230
I understand you had a rather...

1408
01:54:54,469 --> 01:54:55,731
... unfortunate...

1409
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:57,460
...encounter...

1410
01:54:57,739 --> 01:54:59,468
...with the police tonight.

1411
01:54:59,741 --> 01:55:01,766
Yes, I suppose you could call it that.

1412
01:55:02,076 --> 01:55:03,338
How are you feeling now?

1413
01:55:03,645 --> 01:55:04,873
Much better, thank you.

1414
01:55:05,146 --> 01:55:07,478
Feel like talking, answering a few questions?

1415
01:55:07,782 --> 01:55:09,079
Fine, sir. Fine.

1416
01:55:09,951 --> 01:55:12,579
As I said, we've heard about you.

1417
01:55:13,087 --> 01:55:15,783
We are interested in your case.

1418
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:18,891
-We want to help you.
-Thank you very much, sir.

1419
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,288
Shall we get down to it?

1420
01:55:22,497 --> 01:55:24,294
Fine. Fine, sir.

1421
01:55:29,604 --> 01:55:32,402
The newspapers mentioned...

1422
01:55:32,607 --> 01:55:36,907
...in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and violence...

1423
01:55:37,178 --> 01:55:40,511
...you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

1424
01:55:41,582 --> 01:55:44,608
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

1425
01:55:44,986 --> 01:55:46,886
You see, missus...

1426
01:55:47,121 --> 01:55:50,613
... I'm very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

1427
01:55:51,726 --> 01:55:53,694
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1428
01:55:53,928 --> 01:55:56,294
-B-E-...
-All right, thank you.

1429
01:55:56,798 --> 01:56:00,825
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me...

1430
01:56:01,135 --> 01:56:05,037
...a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp...

1431
01:56:05,306 --> 01:56:08,833
...the background music
was playing Beethoven.

1432
01:56:09,043 --> 01:56:11,841
So now you have
the same reaction to music...

1433
01:56:12,046 --> 01:56:13,843
...as you do to sex and violence?

1434
01:56:14,048 --> 01:56:18,417
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the Ninth.

1435
01:56:18,653 --> 01:56:20,416
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

1436
01:56:20,655 --> 01:56:23,647
That's right. I can't listen
to the Ninth anymore at all.

1437
01:56:23,925 --> 01:56:27,361
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like...

1438
01:56:27,662 --> 01:56:29,254
...this funny feeling.

1439
01:56:30,331 --> 01:56:34,563
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

1440
01:56:34,869 --> 01:56:39,272
-I beg your pardon?
-Snuff it. Death, I mean.

1441
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:42,065
I just want to die peacefully...

1442
01:56:42,577 --> 01:56:44,875
...like, with no pain.

1443
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,580
Do you feel that way now?

1444
01:56:48,683 --> 01:56:50,674
No, sir, not exactly.

1445
01:56:50,885 --> 01:56:52,182
I still feel...

1446
01:56:52,386 --> 01:56:53,683
...very miserable.

1447
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:56,448
Very much down in spirits.

1448
01:56:56,991 --> 01:56:58,288
Do you still feel...

1449
01:56:58,559 --> 01:57:00,049
...suicidal?

1450
01:57:03,297 --> 01:57:05,094
Well. Put it this way:

1451
01:57:05,366 --> 01:57:08,199
I feel very low in myself.

1452
01:57:09,003 --> 01:57:11,369
I can't see much in the future.

1453
01:57:11,606 --> 01:57:16,066
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

1454
01:57:29,323 --> 01:57:30,984
Well done, Frank.

1455
01:57:36,998 --> 01:57:38,795
Julian, get the car, would you, please?

1456
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:00,751
I woke up...

1457
01:58:06,327 --> 01:58:10,058
... the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

1458
01:58:18,139 --> 01:58:20,972
Then I realized what it was.

1459
01:58:22,276 --> 01:58:25,040
The music coming up
from the floor...

1460
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:28,476
... was our old friend,
Ludwig van...

1461
01:58:28,783 --> 01:58:31,377
...and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

1462
01:58:39,293 --> 01:58:40,692
Let me out!

1463
01:58:40,962 --> 01:58:42,691
Open the door!

1464
01:58:43,397 --> 01:58:45,558
Come on, open the door!

1465
01:58:48,102 --> 01:58:49,399
Turn it off!

1466
01:58:49,604 --> 01:58:51,401
Turn it off!

1467
01:58:58,312 --> 01:58:59,210
Stop it!

1468
01:59:47,528 --> 01:59:49,018
Turn it off!

1469
01:59:50,464 --> 01:59:51,431
Please!

1470
01:59:51,666 --> 01:59:53,861
Turn it off!

1471
02:00:07,782 --> 02:00:10,683
Suddenly, I viddied
what I had to do...

1472
02:00:10,952 --> 02:00:13,250
...and what I had wanted to do.

1473
02:00:13,654 --> 02:00:16,088
And that was to do myself in.

1474
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:17,889
To snuff it.

1475
02:00:18,259 --> 02:00:21,592
To blast off forever,
out of this wicked, cruel world.

1476
02:00:23,197 --> 02:00:25,597
One moment of pain, perhaps...

1477
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,663
...and then sleep.

1478
02:00:27,902 --> 02:00:30,462
Forever and ever...

1479
02:00:30,705 --> 02:00:32,002
...and ever.

1480
02:00:56,497 --> 02:00:58,226
I jumped, O my brothers...

1481
02:00:58,532 --> 02:00:59,931
...and I fell hard.

1482
02:01:00,201 --> 02:01:02,499
But I did not snuff it.

1483
02:01:03,104 --> 02:01:04,696
If I had snuffed it...

1484
02:01:04,939 --> 02:01:08,306
...I would not be here
to tell what I have told.

1485
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:14,808
I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap...

1486
02:01:15,049 --> 02:01:18,348
... of what might have been
a million years.

1487
02:01:47,081 --> 02:01:49,641
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

1488
02:02:29,723 --> 02:02:31,213
Hello, lad.

1489
02:02:31,525 --> 02:02:33,015
Hello, son.

1490
02:02:34,028 --> 02:02:35,427
How are you?

1491
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:38,621
You feeling better?

1492
02:02:43,037 --> 02:02:44,129
What...

1493
02:02:44,338 --> 02:02:45,396
...gives...

1494
02:02:46,841 --> 02:02:48,832
... O my Pee and Em?

1495
02:02:49,743 --> 02:02:51,335
What makes...

1496
02:02:52,113 --> 02:02:53,011
...you think...

1497
02:02:53,314 --> 02:02:55,714
...you are welcome?

1498
02:02:58,652 --> 02:03:00,643
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

1499
02:03:00,855 --> 02:03:02,516
He doesn't mean it.

1500
02:03:04,959 --> 02:03:07,450
You were in the papers again, son.

1501
02:03:08,262 --> 02:03:09,854
It said...

1502
02:03:10,131 --> 02:03:12,827
...they had done
great wrong to you.

1503
02:03:13,667 --> 02:03:15,032
It said...

1504
02:03:15,336 --> 02:03:16,633
... how the government...

1505
02:03:16,871 --> 02:03:18,862
...drove you to try...

1506
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:20,664
...and do yourself in.

1507
02:03:22,543 --> 02:03:24,773
And when you think about it, son...

1508
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:28,542
... maybe it was our fault too...

1509
02:03:28,883 --> 02:03:30,145
...in a way.

1510
02:03:31,252 --> 02:03:33,152
Your home's your home...

1511
02:03:33,487 --> 02:03:36,047
...when all's said and done, son.

1512
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,560
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Doctor.

1513
02:03:57,511 --> 02:03:59,706
-How are you feeling today?
-Fine, fine.

1514
02:04:00,014 --> 02:04:01,106
Good. May I?

1515
02:04:01,515 --> 02:04:03,574
-I'm Dr. Taylor.
-Haven't seen you before.

1516
02:04:03,817 --> 02:04:05,114
I'm your psychiatrist.

1517
02:04:05,419 --> 02:04:07,284
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

1518
02:04:07,521 --> 02:04:09,011
Just part of hospital routine.

1519
02:04:09,223 --> 02:04:11,418
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

1520
02:04:13,093 --> 02:04:15,084
I'm going to show you
some slides...

1521
02:04:15,329 --> 02:04:18,196
...and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

1522
02:04:19,099 --> 02:04:20,031
Jolly good.

1523
02:04:22,136 --> 02:04:23,694
You know anything about dreams?

1524
02:04:24,138 --> 02:04:25,230
Something, yes.

1525
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:27,236
-You know what they mean?
-Perhaps.

1526
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:28,908
You concerned about something?

1527
02:04:29,243 --> 02:04:32,235
No, not concerned, really...

1528
02:04:32,546 --> 02:04:34,537
... but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1529
02:04:34,748 --> 02:04:36,238
Very nasty.

1530
02:04:36,517 --> 02:04:38,417
It's like...

1531
02:04:40,421 --> 02:04:42,548
...when I was all smashed up,
you know...

1532
02:04:42,856 --> 02:04:44,915
...and half-awake
and unconscious-like...

1533
02:04:45,159 --> 02:04:47,252
... I kept having this dream.

1534
02:04:47,528 --> 02:04:50,429
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

1535
02:04:50,631 --> 02:04:52,724
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

1536
02:04:52,967 --> 02:04:55,868
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

1537
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:58,231
Do you think it means anything?

1538
02:04:59,139 --> 02:05:03,576
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

1539
02:05:03,777 --> 02:05:05,870
It's all part
of the recovery process.

1540
02:05:07,147 --> 02:05:09,945
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply...

1541
02:05:10,251 --> 02:05:12,242
...from one of the people
in the picture.

1542
02:05:12,453 --> 02:05:15,650
You tell me what you think
the person would say...

1543
02:05:15,889 --> 02:05:16,787
...all right?

1544
02:05:17,057 --> 02:05:18,490
Righty-right.

1545
02:05:20,461 --> 02:05:22,793
" Isn't the plumage beautiful? "

1546
02:05:24,098 --> 02:05:26,566
I just say what the
other person would say?

1547
02:05:30,704 --> 02:05:32,262
Don't think about it too long.

1548
02:05:32,506 --> 02:05:34,997
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1549
02:05:37,678 --> 02:05:40,078
Cabbages. Knickers.

1550
02:05:41,215 --> 02:05:43,581
It's not got a beak.

1551
02:05:43,784 --> 02:05:45,081
Good.

1552
02:05:48,722 --> 02:05:52,624
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill. "

1553
02:05:53,627 --> 02:05:55,322
My mind is a blank...

1554
02:05:56,430 --> 02:06:00,332
...and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

1555
02:06:00,601 --> 02:06:01,590
Good.

1556
02:06:04,204 --> 02:06:06,297
"What do you want? "

1557
02:06:07,408 --> 02:06:10,741
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

1558
02:06:11,145 --> 02:06:12,510
Good.

1559
02:06:16,016 --> 02:06:19,508
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back. "

1560
02:06:19,953 --> 02:06:23,218
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1561
02:06:23,418 --> 02:06:24,418
Good.

1562
02:06:27,561 --> 02:06:30,257
"You can do whatever
you like with these. "

1563
02:06:31,865 --> 02:06:33,662
Eggiwegs.

1564
02:06:34,168 --> 02:06:36,136
I would like...

1565
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:37,667
...to smash them.

1566
02:06:38,472 --> 02:06:39,769
And pick them all up...

1567
02:06:39,973 --> 02:06:41,668
...and throw--

1568
02:06:41,875 --> 02:06:43,342
Fucking hell!

1569
02:06:44,178 --> 02:06:46,544
There. That's all there is to it.

1570
02:06:47,181 --> 02:06:48,671
Are you all right?

1571
02:06:49,583 --> 02:06:50,982
Hope so.

1572
02:06:51,151 --> 02:06:54,177
-Is that the end, then?
-Yes.
-I was quite enjoying that.

1573
02:06:54,488 --> 02:06:55,785
Good. I'm glad.

1574
02:06:56,090 --> 02:06:57,182
How many did I get right?

1575
02:06:57,491 --> 02:06:59,254
It's not that kind of a test.

1576
02:06:59,493 --> 02:07:02,792
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

1577
02:07:03,497 --> 02:07:04,862
When do I get out, then?

1578
02:07:05,099 --> 02:07:07,761
I'm sure it won't be long now.

1579
02:07:09,103 --> 02:07:10,695
So I waited...

1580
02:07:11,004 --> 02:07:12,471
...and, O my brothers...

1581
02:07:12,906 --> 02:07:14,271
...I got a lot better...

1582
02:07:14,508 --> 02:07:17,773
...munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast...

1583
02:07:18,011 --> 02:07:20,479
...and lovely steakie-wakes.

1584
02:07:20,681 --> 02:07:22,171
And then one day...

1585
02:07:22,416 --> 02:07:26,512
... they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

1586
02:07:31,992 --> 02:07:34,688
-Just wait outside for a moment, would you, Officer?
-Yes, sir.

1587
02:07:37,798 --> 02:07:39,925
I'm afraid my change of schedule has thrown you.

1588
02:07:40,234 --> 02:07:42,429
The patient's in the middle of supper.

1589
02:07:42,703 --> 02:07:45,536
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all.

1590
02:07:47,007 --> 02:07:49,999
-Good evening, my boy.
-Hi there, my little droogies.

1591
02:07:50,244 --> 02:07:52,041
How are you getting on, young man?

1592
02:07:52,413 --> 02:07:54,643
Great, sir. Just great.

1593
02:07:55,416 --> 02:07:57,008
Can I do anything more for you?

1594
02:07:57,217 --> 02:07:59,014
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.
Thank you very much.

1595
02:07:59,219 --> 02:08:01,847
Then I leave you to it.
Nurse!

1596
02:08:04,725 --> 02:08:07,956
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1597
02:08:08,262 --> 02:08:09,456
Yes, sir.

1598
02:08:10,063 --> 02:08:12,429
And a very lonely place
it is too, sir...

1599
02:08:12,666 --> 02:08:15,032
...when I wake up in the mid of night
with me pain.

1600
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:18,734
Yes. Well, anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1601
02:08:18,972 --> 02:08:21,566
I kept in touch with the hospital, of course.

1602
02:08:21,875 --> 02:08:23,672
And now I've come down
personally...

1603
02:08:23,877 --> 02:08:25,469
...to see how you're getting along.

1604
02:08:25,946 --> 02:08:28,244
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1605
02:08:28,449 --> 02:08:29,939
Tortures of the damned.

1606
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:33,276
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely--

1607
02:08:33,487 --> 02:08:36,285
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1608
02:08:36,656 --> 02:08:37,647
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

1609
02:08:38,492 --> 02:08:42,690
I can tell you with all sincerity that I
and the government of which I'm a member...

1610
02:08:42,963 --> 02:08:46,899
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1611
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:48,397
We tried to help you.

1612
02:08:48,602 --> 02:08:52,698
We followed recommendations which were made
to us that turned out to be wrong.

1613
02:08:53,106 --> 02:08:56,974
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1614
02:08:57,611 --> 02:09:00,876
We want you to regard us as friends.

1615
02:09:01,114 --> 02:09:02,376
We put you right.

1616
02:09:02,783 --> 02:09:04,717
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1617
02:09:04,918 --> 02:09:07,113
We never wished you harm.

1618
02:09:07,421 --> 02:09:10,117
But there are some who did, and do.

1619
02:09:10,624 --> 02:09:13,286
And I think you know who those are.

1620
02:09:13,894 --> 02:09:17,625
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1621
02:09:17,931 --> 02:09:20,297
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

1622
02:09:20,501 --> 02:09:23,629
...for they thought they could then
blame it all on the government.

1623
02:09:24,304 --> 02:09:26,636
There is also a certain man...

1624
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,331
...a writer of subversive
literature...

1625
02:09:29,643 --> 02:09:31,736
...who has been howling
for your blood.

1626
02:09:31,945 --> 02:09:35,346
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1627
02:09:35,816 --> 02:09:37,306
But you're safe from him now.

1628
02:09:37,551 --> 02:09:39,610
We put him away.

1629
02:09:41,522 --> 02:09:44,616
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1630
02:09:45,158 --> 02:09:47,558
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1631
02:09:47,861 --> 02:09:52,059
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

1632
02:09:52,366 --> 02:09:55,767
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1633
02:09:56,637 --> 02:09:57,763
He was a menace.

1634
02:09:57,971 --> 02:10:00,064
We put him away
for his own protection.

1635
02:10:00,274 --> 02:10:01,673
And also for yours.

1636
02:10:02,442 --> 02:10:03,773
Where is he now, sir?

1637
02:10:04,077 --> 02:10:07,535
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1638
02:10:07,781 --> 02:10:10,841
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

1639
02:10:11,151 --> 02:10:13,176
We are interested in you.

1640
02:10:13,954 --> 02:10:16,980
When you leave here, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

1641
02:10:17,257 --> 02:10:19,384
A good job on a good salary.

1642
02:10:19,593 --> 02:10:21,356
What job and how much?

1643
02:10:22,195 --> 02:10:26,188
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary which you would regard as adequate.

1644
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,595
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

1645
02:10:28,902 --> 02:10:32,497
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

1646
02:10:32,773 --> 02:10:36,402
... but also because
you are helping us.

1647
02:10:37,611 --> 02:10:39,203
Helping you, sir?

1648
02:10:39,479 --> 02:10:42,607
We always help our friends,
don't we?

1649
02:10:49,122 --> 02:10:51,386
It is no secret
that this government...

1650
02:10:51,625 --> 02:10:54,788
... has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1651
02:10:55,028 --> 02:10:58,429
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1652
02:10:58,632 --> 02:11:01,430
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

1653
02:11:01,635 --> 02:11:03,034
...of what we tried to do.

1654
02:11:04,004 --> 02:11:07,303
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1655
02:11:07,541 --> 02:11:09,236
And you, Alex...

1656
02:11:09,509 --> 02:11:11,340
...if I may call you Alex ...

1657
02:11:11,612 --> 02:11:14,911
Certainly, sir.
What do they call you at home?

1658
02:11:16,249 --> 02:11:17,511
My name is Frederick.

1659
02:11:18,452 --> 02:11:20,317
As I was saying, Alex...

1660
02:11:20,554 --> 02:11:25,457
...you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1661
02:11:28,762 --> 02:11:30,821
Do you understand, Alex?

1662
02:11:31,665 --> 02:11:33,963
Do I make myself clear?

1663
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:39,168
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1664
02:11:39,673 --> 02:11:43,074
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1665
02:11:43,343 --> 02:11:44,776
You can rely on me, Fred.

1666
02:11:44,978 --> 02:11:46,343
Good.

1667
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:48,047
Good boy.

1668
02:11:49,082 --> 02:11:50,947
I understand you're fond of music.

1669
02:11:51,184 --> 02:11:53,379
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

1670
02:11:53,687 --> 02:11:55,086
Surprise?

1671
02:11:55,355 --> 02:11:57,050
One that I hope that you will like...

1672
02:11:57,290 --> 02:11:58,689
...as a...

1673
02:11:59,493 --> 02:12:00,892
... how shall we put it...

1674
02:12:01,094 --> 02:12:04,359
...as a symbol of
our new understanding.

1675
02:12:05,365 --> 02:12:08,664
An understanding between two friends.

1676
02:13:28,682 --> 02:13:31,344
I was cured, all right!

1677
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:51,740
