1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
片名:发条橘子 

2
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:42,620
那就是我 阿历克斯
There was me.

3
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,756
和我的三个死党
That is, Alex, and my three droogs.

4
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:49,658
他们是皮特 乔治和迪姆
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

5
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,868
我们坐在科洛奶吧
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar, trying to make up our rassoodocks

6
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,134
盘算着如何渡过今晚
what to do with the evening.

7
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,935
科洛奶吧买新鲜的奶
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

8
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:04,840
加料奶 混合奶和人奶
Milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom

9
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:07,039
就是我们喝的这种
which is what we were drinking.

10
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:08,983
令我们回味无穷
This would sharpen you up

11
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:13,178
令我们想要来点暴力
and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

12
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:20,896
在都柏林这美丽的城市
In Dublin's fair city

13
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:25,889
有许多美丽的姑娘
Where the girls are so pretty

14
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:30,894
我第一眼就看上了
I first set my eyes

15
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:34,602
甜心莫莉・马龙
On sweet Molly Malone

16
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:39,915
她骑车穿过我身边
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

17
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,919
又穿过宽敞和狭窄的街道
Through streets broad and narrow

18
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,926
唱着和谐
又忧怨的曲调
Crying, "Cockles and mussels "

19
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:52,929
我永远不能容忍的是
One thing I could never stand 

20
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:55,429
看见一个肮脏 丑陋的老醉汉
was to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie

21
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:58,326
在街上大喊大叫
howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers

22
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:00,933
不停地唱着无聊的歌
and going "blerp blerp" in between

23
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:05,541
好像要把他的心都掏出来
as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking guts.

24
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,337
我从不能忍受看见这种人 不论他年纪多大
I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age.

25
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:12,708
特别是象他这么老的
But more especially when he was real old, like this one was.

26
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:24,349
能给我点零钱吗?兄弟
Can you spare some cutter, me brothers?

27
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:32,935
能插进一点吗?混蛋
我不想再活了
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards! I don't want to live anyway.

28
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:35,734
不想在这种世界生存
Not in a stinking world like this.

29
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:41,877
这个世界有什么错?
And what's so stinking about it?

30
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,144
这个世界错在没有法律和秩序
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order anymore!

31
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:49,476
错在让青年们欺压老年人
It stinks because it lets the young get onto the old

32
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:52,087
像你们一样
like you done!

33
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:56,889
这个世界也容不下一个老人
It's no world for an old man any longer.

34
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,896
这是个怎样的世界
What kind of a world is it at all?

35
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:02,997
人类去到月球上
Men on the moon.

36
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,790
人类在绕着地球转
Men spinning around the earth.

37
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,062
在这个世界里鬼混
And there's not no attention paid

38
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:13,009
但却不受法律制约
to earthly law and order no more.

39
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:15,770
亲爱的大地
Oh, dear land

40
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,477
我为你而战
I fought for thee

41
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:56,051
在赌场里我们见到了比利
It was at the derelict casino that we came across Billy-boy

42
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:59,813
和他的四个死党
and his four droogs.

43
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:02,057
他们准备来玩一种古老的
They were about to perform a little of the old

44
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:06,761
进进出出的男女游戏
in-out, in-out on a weepy young devotchka they had there.

45
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,780
这不是那帮
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking

46
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:04,119
肮脏卑鄙的比利男孩吗
billy goat Billy-boy in poison.

47
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,780
你们好啊
How are thou

48
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,890
又在拿别人的身体开玩笑
thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil?

49
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:15,189
来跟我们玩吧
Come and get one in the yarbles

50
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,296
如果你们有种的话
if you have any yarbles

51
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,525
你们一定满意
you eunuch jelly, thou.

52
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,131
上去搞他们 来吧
Let's get them, boys!

53
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,201
警察
The police!

54
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:27,393
快跑
Come on. Let's go!

55
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:52,920
杜兰高 95 跑起来实在爽得很
The Durango 95 purred away real horrorshow.

56
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:57,394
你肚子里会有一种温暖的振荡快感
A nice, warm vibratey feeling all through your guttiwuts.

57
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,235
旁边都是漆黑的树 我的弟兄们
Soon it was trees and dark, my brothers

58
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:03,631
真的乡下的漆黑
with real country dark.

59
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,278
我们把路上的司机都吓坏了
We fillied around with other travelers of the night

60
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,282
我们玩命地在路上飞
playing Hogs of the Road.

61
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,473
然后我们向西
Then we headed west.

62
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:52,448
下面我们要玩的是惊人的访问
What we were after now was the old surprise visit.

63
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:53,882
那绝对是一次冒险
That was a real kick

64
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,593
充满了笑料和超人的暴力
and good for laughs and lashing of the old ultra-violent.

65
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,034
到底是谁?
Who on earth could that be?

66
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:59,746
我去看一下
I'll go and see.

67
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,160
是谁?
Yes, who is it?

68
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:16,428
对不起 我们遇上了车祸
Excuse me, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident!

69
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:21,773
我兄弟受伤了 想借一下电话叫个救护车
My friend's bleeding to death! Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?

70
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:25,480
但我们没有电话 请到别处找找
We don't have a telephone. You'll have to go somewhere else.

71
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:28,477
但这可是人命关天啊
But, missus, it's a matter of life and death!

72
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:29,781
亲爱的 是谁
Who is it, dear?

73
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:32,579
有个年青人 说他遇上车祸
A young man. He says there's been an accident.

74
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,484
想进来借电话
He wants to use the telephone.

75
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,960
我想你应让他进来
Well, I suppose you better let him in.

76
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,860
请等一下
Wait a minute, will you?

77
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:47,559
我们很少让陌生人进来
I'm sorry, but we don't usually let strangers in--

78
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,213
你们想干什么?
What do you want from me?

79
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:07,820
皮特 再搜搜其他地方 蒂姆
Pete, check the rest of the house. Dim 

80
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,930
我在雨中歌唱
I'm singing in the rain

81
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,601
在雨中歌唱
Just singing in the rain

82
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:20,532
多爽的感觉
What a glorious feeling

83
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:22,894
我又高兴起来了
I'm happy again

84
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,105
我在云中大笑
I'm laughing at clouds So dark up above

85
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,608


86
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:33,047
上面是多么的黑
太阳在我心中
The sun's in my heart

87
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:36,518
我已准备去爱
And I'm ready for love

88
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,621
让乌黑的云去追逐
Let the stormy clouds chase

89
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:43,615
它下面每一个人
Everyone from the place

90
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:46,161
我从雨中来
Come on with the rain

91
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:48,255
我面带微笑
I've a smile on my face

92
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:51,358
我走在大路上
I'll walk down the lane

93
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:54,268
有一副幸福的面容
With a happy refrain

94
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,269
我在唱
And I'm singing

95
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,543
只是唱
Just singing

96
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,670
在雨中
in the rain

97
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,440
我在雨中歌唱
I'm singing in the rain

98
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,840
在雨中歌唱
Just singing in the rain

99
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,840
多爽的感觉
What a glorious feeling

100
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:26,194
我又高兴起来了
I'm happy again

101
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,305
我在云中大笑
I'm laughing at clouds

102
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,608
上面是多么的黑
So dark up above

103
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,603
太阳在我心中
The sun's in my heart

104
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,845
我已准备去爱
And I'm ready for love

105
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,540
让乌黑的云去追逐
Let the stormy clouds chase

106
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:49,356
它下面每一个人
Everyone from the place

107
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,223
我从雨中来
Come on with the rain

108
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,855
我面带微笑
I've a smile on my face

109
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:59,158
我走在大路上
I'll walk down the lane

110
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:03,268
有一副幸福的面容
With a happy refrain

111
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:05,669
我在唱
And I'm singing

112
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,373
只是唱
Just singing

113
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,512
在雨中
in the rain

114
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:10,945
看好了 小兄弟
Viddy well, little brother.

115
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,841
看清楚
Viddy well.

116
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:37,036
我们每个人都筋疲力尽
We were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed

117
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,867
这个晚上消耗了一些能量
it having been an evening of some small energy expenditure, oh my brothers.

118
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:47,081
所以我们又来到科洛奶吧
So we got rid of the auto and stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

119
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:55,747
路西 你好
Hello, Lucy.

120
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,686
今晚忙吗?
Had a busy night?

121
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,795
我们也工作很忙
We've been working hard too.

122
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,064
原谅我吧 路西
Pardon me, Luce.

123
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,201
角落里有些电影制片厂的人
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner

124
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:20,014
一边笑一边吵闹
laughing and govoreeting.

125
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:25,777
他们好像不在乎这个
颠倒黑白的世界
The devotchka smeched away, not caring about the wicked world one bit.

126
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:29,320
立体声唱机上的唱片放完了
Then the disk on the stereo twanged off and out.

127
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:32,891
在下一张开始前的短暂静寂
And in the short silence before the next one came on

128
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:36,291
那个女的突然放声唱了起来
she suddenly came with a burst of singing.

129
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,433
我的兄弟们 我感到就像
And it was like, for a moment, O my brothers

130
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:46,037
有只大鸟飞进了奶吧
some great bird had flown into the milk bar.

131
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,744
我感到我帽子里的头发
And I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott

132
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,610
都竖起来了
standing endwise.

133
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:56,108
浑身颤抖 就像很多小蜥蜴
And the shivers crawling up like slow, malenky lizards

134
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:57,944
慢慢地爬上爬下
and then down again.

135
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,916
因为我知道她在唱什么
Because I knew what she sang.

136
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,224
那是第九交响曲中的一段
It was a bit from the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

137
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,817
路德维希・凡・贝多芬的作品

138
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:15,770
为什么你这么做
What did you do that for?

139
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,762
为的是惩罚你这个
For being a bastard with no manners.

140
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,941
没有教养的家伙
Without a dook of an idea about how to comport yourself public-wise, O my brother.

141
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,449
我不喜欢你了
I don't like you should do what you done.

142
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,851
我再不是你的兄弟 再也不想当了
And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.

143
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,689
看清楚
Watch that.

144
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,766
看清楚了
如果不想活下去的话 就去死吧
Do watch that, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.

145
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:45,995
混蛋!
Yarbles!

146
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:49,470
好啊 你最好给车撞死
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

147
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:53,408
任何时候 我会用铁链
枷锁或镣铐来对付你的
I'll meet you with chain or nozh or britva anytime.

148
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:56,003
我并不想你毫无理由地针对我
I'm not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless.

149
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:59,379
根本不需要任何理由
It stands to reason, I won't have it.

150
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,520
你乖乖的 就不要乱说话
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

151
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,133
够了
Doobidoob.

152
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:28,332
也许我有些累了
A bit tired maybe.

153
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,312
最好不要再说了
Best not to say more.

154
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,140
现在到了该睡觉的时候了
Bedways is rightways now.

155
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,420
所以 回家去睡个好觉吧
So best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka.

156
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,522
是吗?是吗?
Right, right?

157
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,540
是呀 是呀　　　是呀 是呀
-Right, right. -Right, right.

158
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:56,432
我是和父母一起住的
Where I lived was with my dada and mum

159
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:01,073
住在城市公寓18-A区路北
in municipal flat block 18-A, Linear North.

160
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:28,930
那是一个美妙的夜晚
It had been a wonderful evening.

161
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:32,656
现在我要做的是用路德维希・凡・贝多芬
And what I needed now to give it the perfect ending

162
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:35,869
的交响乐制造出一个完美的结局
was a bit of the old Ludwig van.

163
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,319
天哪 极乐世界
Oh, bliss!

164
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,983
极乐世界和天堂
Bliss and heaven!

165
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:35,087
那么壮丽 面带一丝血淋淋的气息
It was gorgeousness and gorgeosity made flesh.

166
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:39,601
那就像一只具有神仙气质
披着稀有绢纱的鸟
It was like a bird of rarest spun heaven metal.

167
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:43,606
或者看琼液在宇宙飞船里漂浮
Or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship

168
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,608
重力已经不复存在了
gravity all nonsense now.

169
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:48,611
当我闭上眼的时候
As I slooshied

170
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:51,903
眼前浮现出了这些可爱的场景
I knew such lovely pictures.

171
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,924
阿历克斯!阿历克斯!
Alex. Alex!

172
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:20,074
阿历克斯!阿历克斯!
Alex. Alex!

173
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:21,644
你想干什么?
What do you want?

174
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:22,644
阿历克斯 已经过了8点了
It's past eight, Alex.

175
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:26,671
孩子 上学不要迟到了
You don't want to be late for school, son.

176
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,778
妈妈 我有点头痛
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

177
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:33,577
不要管我了 我睡会就会好的
Leave us be, and I'll try and sleep it off.

178
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,558
那时就会没事的
And then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.

179
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,585
但你已经整个星期没上学了
But you've not been to school all week, son.

180
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,056
妈妈 去休息会儿吧
Got to rest, Mum.

181
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:44,394
或去锻炼一下
Got to get fit.

182
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,292
否则 我很可能会旷更多的课
Otherwise, I'm liable to miss a lot more school.

183
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:53,768
我把你的早餐放在烤炉里 我可要上班去了
我不理你了
I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off meself now.

184
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:59,671
好的 妈妈
祝你在工厂里一天都愉快
All right, Mum. Have a nice day at the factory.

185
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:06,481
他爸 孩子有点不舒服
He's not feeling too good again this morning, Dad.

186
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,588
是的 是的 我听到了
Yes. Yes, I heard.

187
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,514
你知道昨晚他什么时候回来吗?
You know what time he got in?

188
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,784
不知道 我睡得很熟
No, I don't. I'd taken me sleepers.

189
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:17,699
我想知道
I wonder

190
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,326
他这些晚上究竟都在哪里、干了什么
where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.

191
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,938
就像他所说的
Like he says

192
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,711
干了一些单调乏味的事情
it's mostly odd things he does.

193
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,936
可能是帮别人干这干那
Helping-like here and there, as it might be.

194
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:32,840


195
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:16,757
你好 特托依先生
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

196
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,692
看见你在这里 我非常惊讶
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

197
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:22,764
阿历克斯
终于都起床了 是吗?
Alex-boy! Awake at last, yes?

198
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:26,490
我在上班的路上碰到你妈妈了
I met your mother on the way to work, yes?

199
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,759
她给了我房门钥匙
She gave me the key.

200
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:33,803
她说你不太舒服
She said something about a pain somewhere.

201
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,778
所以没去上学 对吧?
Hence, not at school, yes?

202
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,509
头痛得难以忍受 先生
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother sir.

203
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,876
午饭后 应该会好起来吧
It should be clear by this afterlunch.

204
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:45,787
或者晚上之前
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

205
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:49,886
夜晚不错吧 孩子?
The evening's the great time, isn't it, Alex-boy?

206
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:53,584
喝点茶吗 先生?　　没时间 没时间
-Cup of the old chai, sir? -No time, no time.

207
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,419
坐 坐 坐这!
Sit, sit, sit!

208
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:59,796
我怎么能有如此荣幸 先生
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir?

209
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:01,695
我做错了什么 先生?
Anything wrong, sir?

210
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,737
错?你怎会想到做错了什么?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong?

211
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,441
你做了什么不应该做的事吗?
Have you been doing something you shouldn't?

212
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:09,940
只是讲话的方式而已
Just a manner of speech.

213
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,814
我以一个过来人的身份对你说
Yes, well, it's just a manner of speech from your

214
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:16,807
当心点 小阿历克斯
post-corrective advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex.

215
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:20,545
因为下次不是在学校里面了
Because next time it's not going to be the corrective school.

216
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:22,824
也许是在警察局
Next time it'll be the Barley place, and all my work ruined.

217
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:27,361
那我所做的一切就会白费了
如果你毫不自爱的话
If you've no respect for yourself

218
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,831
你也应该珍惜我的劳动
you at least might have some for me, who sweated over you.

219
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:34,824
我不是在矫枉过正
A big, black mark, I tell you, for every one we don't reclaim.

220
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,839
你们犯了错误的话
A confession of failure for every one of you

221
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,675
就很容易一错再错
who ends up in the stripy hole.

222
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:43,473
我没有干什么坏事啊
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

223
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:45,847
一点也没有啊 先生
The millicents have nothing on me, brother.

224
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:48,249
我说的是实话
Sir, I mean.

225
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,853
不要转移话题了
Cut out this clever talk about millicents.

226
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:52,854
只是警察还没有把你抓起来而已
Just because the police haven't picked you up

227
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:56,652
那并不意味着你没干坏事
doesn't mean that you've not been up to some nastiness.

228
00:23:56,892 --> 00:24:01,989
咋晚发生了一些事
一些很糟的事 对吗?
There was a bit of nastiness last night. Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

229
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:06,495
比利一伙的几个朋友被救护车拉走了
A few of a certain Billy-boy's friends were ambulanced off late.

230
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:07,869
有人提到了你的名字
Your name was mentioned.

231
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,871
而这些话传到了我的耳朵里
The words got to me by the usual channels.

232
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:12,874
你的朋友也参与了
Certain friends of yours were named also.

233
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:16,878
没有人可以证明白己任何事
Nobody can prove anything about anybody, as usual.

234
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,280
我在警告你 阿历克斯
I'm warning you, little Alex

235
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,715
作为在这个肮脏世界里
being a good friend to you as always

236
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:24,514
你的永远的好朋友
the one man in this sore and sick community

237
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:27,415
要把你挽救出来
who wants to save you from yourself!

238
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:48,536
你吃错了什么药?
What gets into you all?

239
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,041
我们研究你太久了
We've been studying the problem for damn well near a century.

240
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:53,915
但我们发觉
But we get no farther with our studies.

241
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,918
你有良好的家庭
You got a good home here. Good, loving parents.

242
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:58,920
你的脑子并不太坏
You've got not too bad of a brain.

243
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:03,017
难道是有魔鬼爬进你的心灵?
Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?

244
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:05,156
没有人抓住我任何把柄
Nobody's got anything on me.

245
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,158
我很久没落在警察手里了
I been out of the millicents' rookers for a long time.

246
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:12,857
那正是我担心的 你安全得太久了
That's just what worries me. A bit too long to be safe.

247
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:14,965
你快了 凭我的感觉
You're about due, by my reckoning.

248
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:15,937
所以我要警告你 阿历克斯
That's why I'm warning you

249
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:19,941
别趟这些浑水
to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt.

250
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,944
你明白吗?
Do I make myself clear?

251
00:25:22,077 --> 00:25:23,544
我是一个没有泥污的湖
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

252
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:27,179
像夏天的天空一样清澈
As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer.

253
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:29,680
你要相信我 先生
You can rely on me, sir.

254
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:37,560
打扰了 兄弟
Excuse me, brother.

255
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:41,315
我两周前订的 你看看到了吗?
I ordered this two weeks ago. Can you see if it's arrived?

256
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,022
等一下
Just a minute.

257
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:11,944
对不起 小姐们
Pardon me, ladies.

258
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:24,055
你们快乐吗 宝贝?
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

259
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,067
有点冷淡无聊吧 亲爱的?
A bit cold and pointless, isn't it, my lovely?

260
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:36,308
你怎么了 小妹妹?
What's happened to yours, my little sister?

261
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:39,980
你在找谁?布拉蒂
Who you getting, bratty?

262
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,308
歌戈利・歌戈 乔尼・治瓦格
Goggly Gogol? Johnny Zhivago?

263
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:45,076
还是天堂17?
The Heaven 17?

264
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:52,589
What you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on?

265
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:57,126
我猜你们有小巧可爱的随身播放机
I bet you've got little pitiful, portable picnic players.

266
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:59,526
跟叔叔我来吧 听个痛快
Come with Uncle and hear all proper.

267
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:02,828
听天使的小号和魔鬼的长号
Hear angel trumpets and devil trombones.

268
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:05,096
你们被邀请了
You are invited.

269
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:28,189
你们好
Hi, hi, hi, there.

270
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,923
你好
Well, hello.

271
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:34,419
他来了
He are here! He have arrived!
Hooray!

272
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:37,826
好了 好了
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well!

273
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:44,300
我怎么有此荣幸接受这意外的造访
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?

274
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:51,339
我们有点担心
We got worried.

275
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:59,118
我们在奶吧边喝边等
There we were, waiting and drinking away at the old knifey moloko

276
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:01,846
但你一直没去
and you had not turned up.

277
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:07,125
我们猜可能哪里冒犯了你
And we thought you might have been, like offended by something or other.

278
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:09,762
所以我们到你这里来了
So around we come to your abode.

279
00:30:14,237 --> 00:30:17,364
对不起
Appy polly loggies.

280
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:20,766
我头痛 要睡觉
I had something of a pain in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

281
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,873
我命令醒来时自己却还没醒
I was not awakened when I gave orders for wakening.

282
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:26,249
很担心你的头痛
Sorry about the pain.

283
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,242
用脑太多了吧?
Using the gulliver too much-like, maybe.

284
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:36,445
下命令 定规矩 等等
Giving orders and discipline and such, perhaps.

285
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:42,754
确实不痛了吗?你上床会更好吗?
You sure the pain is gone?You sure you'd not be happier back in bed?

286
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:08,518
有话说清楚
Let's get things nice and sparkling clear.

287
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:14,417
这种讽刺 如果算得上
This sarcasm, if I may call it such

288
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:16,898
可不是你们的风格 我的弟兄们
does not become you, my little brothers.

289
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:23,294
作为你们的朋友和头领
我有权知道发生了什么
As I am your droog and leader I'm entitled to know what goes on.

290
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:25,432
那么 迪姆
Now then, Dim.

291
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,836
你那么呲牙咧嘴一笑预视着什么?
What does that great big horsey gape of a grin portend?

292
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:35,316
不要再欺负迪姆了 兄弟
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother.

293
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:38,318
这是新方式的一部分
That's part of the new way.

294
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:49,730
新方式
这新方式是怎么加速?
New way? What's this about a new way?

295
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:56,623
我知道有人在我睡觉时经常谈到我
There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, I know it.

296
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:00,472
如果你一定要 那么就去吧 
If you must have it, have it, then.

297
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,344
我们四处游荡 打砸抢
We go around shop crasting and the like

298
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:07,773
每人弄到一点点钱
coming out with a pitiful rookerfull of money each.

299
00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:10,380
而"打手"咖啡店里的英国佬威尔
And Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto

300
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:14,247
说他能和任何小伙子一样打
saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast.

301
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,389
闪光的东西 冰
The shiny stuff. The ice!

302
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:21,352
会有很多钱 英国佬威尔这么说的
The big, big money's available, is what Will the English says.

303
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:25,995
你有很多钱会干什么?
And what will you do with the big, big, big money?

304
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,200
你不是什么都有了吗?
Have you not everything you need?

305
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:31,370
如果你要汽车 你从树上取好了
If you need a motorcar, you pluck it from the trees.

306
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:34,908
如果你要漂亮女孩 你可以有
If you need pretty polly, you take it.

307
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:39,505
老弟 你有时想说的就像一个小孩
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child.

308
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:44,818
今晚我们要玩一个大人玩的
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

309
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:47,389
好极了 太棒了
Good! Real horrorshow!

310
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:49,822
动力总是给予那些等待它们的人
Initiative comes to thems that wait.

311
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:54,385
我已经教你很多了 小弟
I've taught you much, my little droogies.

312
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:58,297
现在告诉我你在想什么 乔治小子
Now tell me what you had in mind, Georgie-boy.

313
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:04,833
老样子 先来点加料奶 你说是吧?
The old moloko plus first. Would you not say?

314
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,839
一些让我们兴奋的东西
-Something to sharpen us up. -Some moloko plus.

315
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:16,404
你先请 由你开始
由你开始 加料奶
You got to go there first. We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

316
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:25,557
当我们走在海军码头的岸边
As we walked along the flatblock marina

317
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,363
我表面上很平静 但一直在思考
I was calm on the outside, but thinking all the time.

318
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,166
现在成了乔治来
So now it was to be Georgie the General

319
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,869
命令大伙该干什么 不该干什么
saying what we should do and what not to do.

320
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,040
而没头脑的蒂姆 只会像狗一样傻笑
And Dim as his mindless, grinning bulldog.

321
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,045
突然我想起只有笨蛋才会去思考
But suddenly I viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones

322
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:49,076
聪明人用的是 比如灵感和上帝的旨意
and that the oomny ones used, like, inspiration and what Bog sends.

323
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:53,384
现在帮助我的是美妙的音乐
For now it was lovely music that came to my aid.

324
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:56,748
有音乐从一扇开着的窗户传出
There was a window open with a stereo on

325
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:00,256
我立刻请楚了该做什么
and I viddied right at once what to do.

326
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,421
我没有割到蒂姆的重要线路
I had not cut into any of Dim's main cables.

327
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:11,962
所以在一张干净布的帮助下
And so with the help of a clean tashtook

328
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,136
血很快就不流了
the red, red kroovy soon stopped.

329
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:18,465
我也很快让剩下的两人静下来
And it did not take long to quieten the two wounded soldiers

330
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:21,437
在纽约市公爵小酒吧里
down in the snug of the Duke of New York.

331
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:25,147
现在他们知道谁是头了
Now they knew who was master and leader.

332
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:27,149
一群懦夫
Sheep, thought I.

333
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,152
但一个真正的领导总知道什么时候
But a real leader knows always when, like

334
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:34,182
像是什么时候向手下表示宽大
to give and show generous to his unders.

335
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:38,160
现在我们又回到了原地
Well! Now we're back to where we were.

336
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:40,590
不是吗?
Yes?

337
00:35:41,462 --> 00:35:43,165
像以前一样 忘记一切
Just like before, and all forgotten?

338
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,590
对吗?
Right, right, right?

339
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:48,493
对
Right.

340
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:52,497
对
Right.

341
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:56,999
对
Right.

342
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:02,108
好 乔治小子
Well, Georgie-boy

343
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:06,317
你为今晚出的主意现在告诉我们吧
this idea of yours for tonight. Tell us all about it, then.

344
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,080
今晚不行
Not tonight.

345
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,017
现在不行
Not this nochy.

346
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:14,196
说吧 乔治小子
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

347
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:17,199
你和我们一样都是勇敢的人
You're a big, strong chelloveck, like us all.

348
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,631
我们不是小孩子 不是吗 乔治?
We're not little children, are we, Georgie-boy?

349
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:25,999
那么你究竟在想什么
What, then, didst thou in thy mind have?

350
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:34,216
这是一个健身的农场
It's this health farm.

351
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:37,219
稍微出城的地方
A bit out of the town.

352
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,222
独立的地方
Isolated.

353
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:45,227
它由一个富家女拥有她和她的猫一起住
It's owned by this rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats.

354
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:51,155
这地方已经关闭了一星期她现在一人独处
The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own.

355
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:55,237
那里装满了金银
It's full up with, like, gold and silver

356
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:58,461
还有珠宝
and, like, jewels.

357
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:03,775
告诉我多一点 乔治小子 再多点
Tell me more, Georgie-boy. Tell me more.

358
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:10,882
糟糕
Oh, shit!

359
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,500
是谁?
Who's there?

360
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:33,096
对不起 能帮个忙吗?
Excuse me, can you please help?

361
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:34,899
发生了一起严重事故
There's been a terrible accident!

362
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:38,078
我能用你的电话叫救护车吗?
Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?

363
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:41,081
非常对不起
I'm frightfully sorry.

364
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:45,510
一里外有公用电话
There's a telephone in the public house a mile down the road.

365
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:47,617
我建议你用那个
I suggest you use that.

366
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:49,813
但小姐 这是很紧急
But missus, this is an emergency!

367
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:51,921
关乎生死
It's a matter of life and death!

368
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,926
我朋友倒在路上 流血很多 快要死了
Me friend's lying in the middle of the road, bleeding to death!

369
00:37:56,931 --> 00:38:01,925
非常抱歉 我在天黑后 从不给陌生人开门
I'm very sorry, but I never open the door to strangers after dark.

370
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:06,102
很好 女士
Very well, madam.

371
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,942
你怀疑我们没有错
You can't be blamed for being suspicious

372
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:12,709
现在晚上有很多混蛋在游荡
with so many scoundrels and rogues of the night about.

373
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:15,539
我到酒吧去试试看吧
I'll try and get help at the pub, then.

374
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,319
很抱歉 打扰你
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

375
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:22,312
非常感谢晚安
Thank you very much. Good night.

376
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,591
蒂姆 弯腰
Dim, bend down.

377
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:04,865
我从那扇窗进去再把前门打开
I'll get in that window and open the front door.

378
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:35,224
喂 莱德烈特警察局吗?
Hello, Radlett Police Station?

379
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:39,431
晚上好 我是伍德米尔健身农场的维瑟斯小姐
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers at Woodmere Health Farm.

380
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:45,428
很抱歉打扰你 但刚才发生一些怪事
I'm sorry to bother you, but something rather odd just happened.

381
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:48,540
可能没什么 但我也不敢肯定
It's probably nothing at all, but you never know.

382
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:53,046
一个年轻人敲门 要用电话
A young man rang the bell, asking to use the telephone.

383
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,242
他说有什么事故之类的
He said there's been some kind of accident.

384
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,949
他说的有一点引起了我的注意
The thing that caught my attention was what he said.

385
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:02,120
他的话像是在引用今天早上报纸里的话
His words sounded like those quoted in the papers this morning

386
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:07,428
与昨晚遭袭击的作家和他的妻子有关
in connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted last night.

387
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:09,921
就在几分钟以前
Just a few minutes ago.

388
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,962
如果你认为有必要的话
If you think that's necessary.

389
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:16,930
但我肯定他现在已经走了
But I'm quite sure he's gone away now.

390
00:40:18,572 --> 00:40:20,267
好的 没问题
All right, fine.

391
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:23,335
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

392
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:29,474
哈哈 在这里
Hi, hi, hi, there.

393
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,148
终于见面了
At last we meet.

394
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:35,982
我们得通过收信口的简短交流 可不令人满意
Our brief govorett through the letter-hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory.

395
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,458
你是谁?
Who are you?

396
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:41,784
你怎么进来的?
How the hell did you get in here?

397
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:46,995
你在干什么?
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?

398
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:52,868
调皮 调皮 调皮!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

399
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,699
你这个肮脏的母狗
You filthy old soomaka.

400
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:59,503
现在听着 你这个小混蛋
Now listen here, you little bastard!

401
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:03,271
转过身去 和你进来时一样走出去
Just turn round and walk out of here the same way you came in.

402
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:07,977
不要碰它
Leave that alone! Don't touch it!

403
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:10,622
那是珍贵的艺术品
It's a very important work of art.

404
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,903
你究竟想要什么?
What the bloody hell do you want?

405
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,140
女士 老实说
To be perfectly honest, madam

406
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:31,444
我正在参加一个国际学生竞赛
I'm taking part in an international students'contest

407
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:35,448
看谁卖杂志的得分最多
to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.

408
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,450
废话少说 小子
Cut the shit, sonny

409

大声尖叫
scream

595
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:17,703
无助而无尽的
in endless and unendurable agony.

596
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:19,809
他们的皮肤
Their skin

597
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:22,604
腐烂了并且一块块脱落
rotting and peeling.

598
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:24,613
一个火球
A fireball

599
00:54:24,818 --> 00:54:27,184
在他们的尖叫声中不断飞转
spinning in their screaming guts!

600
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,821
我知道 是的 我知道

00:54:31,624 --> 00:54:33,615
肃静!
Silence!

602
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:36,618
好好听神父讲
Listen to the priest!

好吧 你们这些人 唱完圣诗就结束吧
All right, you lot! We'll end by singing hymn 258

604
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:41,730
来 唱囚犯圣歌集的258号圣歌
in the prisoner's hymnal.

605
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:45,199
让大家净化一下思想 你们这些白痴
And let's have a little reverence, you bastards!

606
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,139
"我是一只迷途小羔羊"
I was a wandering sheep

607
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:53,839
开心唱 该死的　"我并不喜欢羊圈"
-Sing up, damn you! -I did not love the fold

608
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:55,513
大声点!
Louder!

609
00:54:57,851 --> 00:55:02,845
"我不喜欢牧童的嗓音"
I did not love my shepherd's voice

610
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:07,859
"我不会受约束"
I would not be controlled

611
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:10,121
大声点!
Louder!

612
00:55:10,563 --> 00:55:13,623
其实并没有得到启发!一点也没有!
It had not been edifying. Indeed not.

613
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:17,769
在这个该死的人渣动物园里待了两年
Being in this hellhole and human zoo for two years now.

614
00:55:18,038 --> 00:55:21,166
被野蛮的变态打骂和欺压
Being kicked and tolchoked by brutal warders

615
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:24,366
遇到各式各样的罪犯和人渣
and meeting leering criminals and perverts

616
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:26,168
随时准备把像我、您的讲述者
ready to dribble all over

617
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:29,348
这样的好小伙子痛打一顿 就像打破这杯美酒
a luscious young malchick like your storyteller.

618
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:36,845
我自愿
It was my rabbit

619
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:39,853
参加查理神父开展的周日服务活动
to help the prison charlie with the Sunday service.

620
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:43,153
他是个大胖子 一个挺自大的人
He was a bolshy, great burly bastard.

621
00:55:43,396 --> 00:55:46,490
但他很喜欢我 也许因为我很年轻
But he was very fond of myself, me being very young

622
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:50,100
而且现在也对书籍巨作产生了兴趣
and also now very interested in the Big Book.

623
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:15,024
我读了许多关于鞭刑及头戴荆棘的书
I read all about the scourging and the crowning with thorns.

624
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:17,195
我常常想像我也在其中
And I could viddy myself helping in

625
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,389
主管鞭打及钉手指
and even taking charge of the tolchoking and the nailing in.

626
00:56:21,634 --> 00:56:24,933
穿着典型的罗马贵族服装
Being dressed in the height of Roman fashion.

627
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:39,407
我不太喜欢书的后半部分
I didn't so much like the latter part of the Book

628
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:41,813
那更类似于一种形式上的说教
which is more like all preachy talking

629
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:44,215
比不上战斗 和进进出出的把戏
than fighting and the old in-out.

630
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:47,551
我喜欢这些古老的野蛮人互相杀戮的场面
I like the parts where these old yahoodies tolchok each other

631
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:50,057
接着 用敌人的鲜血庆祝胜利
and then drink their Hebrew vino

632
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:53,557
并享受给人无尽快意的夺妻之乐
and getting onto the bed with their wives' handmaidens.

633
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,757
那就是我坚持下去的精神动力
That kept me going.

634
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:30,000
"千万不要做个邪恶的人
"Seek not to be like evil men.

635
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,597
甚至不要去想和他们在一起
Neither desire to be with them

636
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:35,968
因为他们是强盗的化身
because their minds studieth robberies

637
00:57:36,209 --> 00:57:39,110
而且满口粗言秽语"
and their lips speak deceits. "

638
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:40,812
"如果你失去了希望
If thou lose hope

639
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:42,815
在忧郁的日子里感到疲倦
being weary in the days of distress

640
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,380
你的力量就会削弱"
thy strength shall be diminished.

641
00:57:45,618 --> 00:57:47,279
做得好 孩子 非常不错
Fine, my son. Fine.

642
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,817
神父?
Father?

643
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:54,520
我已经尽力了 真的
I have tried, have I not?

644
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:55,919
的确 你尽力了
You have, my son.

645
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:58,494
我已经做到最好了 不错
-I've done my best, have I not? -Indeed.

646
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:02,132
我从没有干过任何犯法的事
I've never been guilty of any institutional infraction, have I?

647
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:06,704
你当然没有 655321 你对我帮助很大
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful.

648
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,841
而且你有改过自新的希望
And you've shown a genuine desire to reform.

649
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:11,340
神父
Father

650
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:15,643
能和您单独谈你一个问题吗?
can I ask you a question in private?

651
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,150
当然可以 孩子
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

652
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:31,853
有什么困扰你吗 我的孩子?
Is there something troubling you, my son?

653
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:37,332
不要害羞 尽管说
Don't be shy to speak up.

654
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,170
记住
Remember

655
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:43,365
我知道
I know of the

656
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:47,444
男青年
urges that can trouble young men

657
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,238
渴求什么
deprived

658
00:58:49,449 --> 00:58:51,440
在与女性社会隔绝的这里
of the society of women.

659
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:56,686
神父 并不是这样的
It's nothing like that, Father.

660
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:03,794
是关于他们新的话题
It's about this new thing they're all talking about.

661
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:05,991
关于新的改造方式
About this new treatment.

662
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:08,598
那会让你尽快出狱
It gets you out of prison in no time.

663
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:11,392
也保证你永远不会再进来
And makes sure you never get back in again.

664
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:14,467
你从哪儿听来的?
Where did you hear about this?

665
00:59:14,707 --> 00:59:17,403
谁讲过这些事?
Who's been talking about these things?

666
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:20,110
到处都有人讲
These things get around.

667
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,610
狱警也在说 那我想应该是真的了
Two warders talk, as it might be.

668
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:25,908
而我恰好听到了这些谈话
And somebody can't help overhearing what they say.

669
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:29,820
有人在车间里找到一张废报纸
Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops

670
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:32,717
一切都在报纸上得到了证实
and the newspaper tells all about it.

671
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:39,325
能让我试试这新方式吗 神父?
How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?

672
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,630
我想你所指的应该是
I take it you are referring

673
00:59:44,904 --> 00:59:47,134
鲁道维科技术吧?
to the Ludovico technique.

674
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:50,239
我不知道那叫什么 神父
I don't know what it's called, Father.

675
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:52,343
我只知道那会让人尽早出狱
All I know is that it gets you out quickly

676
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:55,113
以及保证他不再入狱
and makes sure you never get back in again.

677
00:59:55,815 --> 00:59:58,648
那还没经过证实 655321
That is not proven, 655321.

678
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:03,047
事实上 它现在还处于试验阶段
In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.

679
01:00:03,523 --> 01:00:06,321
已经有人用过了吗?
It has been used, hasn't it?

680
01:00:06,526 --> 01:00:09,324
但在这个监狱还没有
It has not been used in this prison yet.

681
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:11,962
监狱长不太接受这种技术
The governor has grave doubts about it.

682
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:15,962
我听说这种技术危险性很大
And I've heard there are very serious dangers involved.

683
01:00:17,937 --> 01:00:20,838
我不怕危险 神父
I don't care about the dangers.

684
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:24,670
我只想变好
I just want to be good.

685
01:00:25,945 --> 01:00:28,573
我希望以后的生活中
I want for the rest of my life to be

686
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:30,941
我会变得善良
one act of goodness.

687
01:00:31,184 --> 01:00:32,651
问题在于
The question is

688
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:37,682
这种技术是否真的能使人变好
whether or not this technique really makes a man good.

689
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:40,857
善由心生
Goodness comes from within.

690
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,186
善良
Goodness

691
01:00:42,462 --> 01:00:43,793
是由人自己去选择的
is chosen.

692
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:46,290
当人不能选择的时候
When a man cannot choose

693
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:48,693
他也不再是人了
he ceases to be a man.

694
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:55,463
我不懂这些前因后果
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father.

695
01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:59,578
我只知道自己想变好
I only know I want to be good.

696
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:03,614
耐心点 孩子
Be patient, my son.

697
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:06,080
相信上帝 他会帮助你
Put your trust in the Lord.

698
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:11,582
上帝会指引子民 使他们再生
Instruct Thy Son and He shall refresh thee

699
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:14,725
并且净化他们的灵魂
and shall give delight to thy soul.

700
01:01:15,328 --> 01:01:16,590
阿门
Amen.

701
01:01:44,424 --> 01:01:46,358
部长!所有人已到齐 先生
-Mister! -All present and correct, sir!

702
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,617
好
Right!

703
01:01:49,228 --> 01:01:51,253
所有人已到齐
All present and correct, sir!

704
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:48,409
犯人们 停
Prisoners, halt!

705
01:02:48,988 --> 01:02:50,580
现在注意了!
Now pay attention!

706
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,087
我要你们分成两行
I want you in two lines

707
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:55,920
面向这里 背靠墙
up against that wall, facing this way.

708
01:02:56,229 --> 01:02:57,719
来吧 排队
Go on, move!

709
01:02:58,297 --> 01:02:59,229
快点
Hurry up!

710
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:00,794
不要交头接耳
Stop talking!

711
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:09,199
先生 犯人已准备好 请检阅
Prisoners ready for inspection, sir!

712
01:03:25,157 --> 01:03:26,351
一间牢房住多少人?
How many to a cell?

713
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:28,456
在这幢楼里是四个 先生
Four in this block, sir.

714
01:03:29,362 --> 01:03:31,660
把犯人挤到一起我们能得到什么?
Cram criminals together and what do you get?

715
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:35,027
浓缩的犯罪 服刑期间的犯罪 
Concentrated criminality. Crime in the midst of punishment.

716
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:38,965
是的 先生 可我们需要更大的监狱 更多的钱
I agree, sir. We need larger prisons, more money.

717
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:41,036
暂时还不能够满足你的要求
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

718
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,572
政府正准备抛弃
The government can't be concerned any longer

719
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:45,538
过时的受刑规则
with outmoded penalogical theories.

720
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:49,474
不久 我们的监狱都会人满为患
Soon we may need all prison space for political offenders.

721
01:03:49,682 --> 01:03:53,243
普通罪犯最好采用纯治疗性的方式来改造
Common criminals are best dealt with on a purely curative basis.

722
01:03:53,553 --> 01:03:56,181
把顽固不化的罪犯杀掉 这就是新规则
Kill the criminal reflex, that's all.

723
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:58,684
这将会在一年内进行推广实施
Full implementation in a year's time.

724
01:03:58,991 --> 01:04:01,186
你们可以看到 惩罚对一些顽固罪犯毫无作用
Punishment means nothing to them. You can see that.

725
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:04,363
他们甚至享受所谓的惩罚
They enjoy their so-called punishment.

726
01:04:04,664 --> 01:04:05,756
你说得非常对 先生
You're absolutely right, sir.

727
01:04:05,998 --> 01:04:08,592
闭上你的臭嘴
Shut your bleeding hole!

728
01:04:09,268 --> 01:04:10,758
是谁说的?
Who said that?

729
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:12,803
我 先生
I did, sir.

730
01:04:19,078 --> 01:04:20,773
你犯了什么罪?
What crime did you commit?

731
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:23,106
过失杀人罪 先生
The accidental killing of a person, sir.

732
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:26,078
他由于盗窃败露而残忍地杀死女事主
He brutally murdered a woman in furtherance of theft.

733
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,911
他要坐十四年牢 先生
Fourteen years, sir.

734
01:04:29,221 --> 01:04:30,415
很好
Excellent.

735
01:04:31,924 --> 01:04:33,186
他有进取心
He's enterprising

736
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:34,416
有攻击性
aggressive

737
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:35,887
有个人主见
outgoing

738
01:04:36,128 --> 01:04:36,924
年轻
young

739
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:38,526
大胆
bold

740
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:40,289
邪恶
vicious.

741
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:41,791
他会变好的
He'll do.

742
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:43,194
好的
Fine.

743
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:44,926
我们还可以看看C幢
We could still look at C-block.

744
01:04:45,204 --> 01:04:47,229
不 不 这已足够了 他很适合试验
No, no. That's enough. He's perfect.

745
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,203
我想看他的档案
I want his records sent to me.

746
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:50,739
这邪恶的小青年
This vicious young hoodlum

747
01:04:51,043 --> 01:04:52,943
将会改头换面
will be transformed out of all recognition.

748
01:04:53,212 --> 01:04:55,203
非常感谢你给我的机会 先生
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.

749
01:04:55,414 --> 01:04:58,212
我们希望你能够成功 孩子
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.

750
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:00,942
请到我的办公室来吧　谢谢!
-Shall we go to my office? -Thank you.

751
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,057
进来吧
Come in.

752
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:11,761
先生
Sir!

753
01:05:11,964 --> 01:05:13,864
655321已带到!
655321. Sir!

754
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:15,055
非常好 警官
Very good, Chief.

755
01:05:15,334 --> 01:05:16,858
站到白线后面 脚趾不能越过白线
Over to the line. Toes behind it.

756
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:19,637
向狱长讲出你的全名和编号
Full name and number to the governor.

757
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:23,670
亚历山大・德拉吉 先生 编号655321 先生
Alexander DeLarge, sir. 655321, sir.

758
01:05:26,379 --> 01:05:29,473
我认为你并不知道今早那位大人物是谁
I don't suppose you know who that was this morning.

759
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:33,344
他就是内务部长先生
That was no less a personage than the Minister of the Interior.

760
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:35,587
新上任的内务部长正准备
The new Minister of the Interior.

761
01:05:35,855 --> 01:05:38,756
大刀阔斧进行改革
What they call a very new broom.

762
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:43,360
这些可笑的方案最终出台了
These new ridiculous ideas have come at last.

763
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,893
我还是会照章办事
And orders are orders

764
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:49,692
但在个人而言 我并不赞成
though I may say to you in confidence, I do not approve.

765
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:52,199
我认为 以牙还牙
An eye for an eye, I say.

766
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:55,474
如果某人打你 你会还击 对吗?
If someone hits you, you hit back, do you not?

767
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:59,405
为什么国家被像你这样的
Why should not the state, severely hit by you hooligans

768
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:01,408
不良少年攻击时也不还手?
not hit back also?

769
01:06:02,314 --> 01:06:04,282
新的看法是绝不还手
The new view is to say " no. "

770
01:06:04,517 --> 01:06:07,884
它着重于把坏人改造为好人
The new view is that we turn the bad into good.

771
01:06:08,187 --> 01:06:11,179
但在我看来 这很不公正
All of which seems to me to be grossly unjust.

772
01:06:11,524 --> 01:06:14,015
我 闭上你的臭嘴
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

773
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:16,722
你将会改过自新
You are to be reformed.

774
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,021
明天 你会去见一个名叫布罗德斯基的人
Tomorrow you will go to this man, Brodsky.

775
01:06:20,332 --> 01:06:21,890
你将会离开这里
You will be leaving here.

776
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:26,400
会被送到鲁道维科医疗中心
You will be transferred to the Ludovico medical facility.

777
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:30,642
可以相信 你会在两星期内离开国家监狱
It's believed you'll be able to leave state custody in a fortnight.

778
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:32,743
我觉得这消息会让你很高兴 对吧?
I suppose that prospect pleases you?

779
01:06:33,045 --> 01:06:34,808
回答狱长的话
Answer the governor's question!

780
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:36,412
一定会的 先生 非常感谢
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

781
01:06:36,649 --> 01:06:38,947
我在这里已经做得很好了 真的
I've done my best here, I really have, sir.

782
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:41,446
谢谢大家的关心 先生
I'm very grateful to all concerned, sir.

783
01:06:43,723 --> 01:06:46,055
在这里标记的地方签个名
Sign this where it's marked.

784
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:51,320
不要看 只管签!
Don't read it, sign it!

785
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:55,261
上面讲的是你自愿把受刑
It says you're willing to have your sentence commuted

786
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:58,469
改为鲁道维科治疗方式
to submission to the Ludovico treatment.

787
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:00,069
还有这张
And this.

788
01:07:07,246 --> 01:07:08,838
还有这张复本
And another copy.

789
01:07:21,393 --> 01:07:23,258
第二天早上 我被带往
The next morning I was taken to

790
01:07:23,462 --> 01:07:25,191
鲁道维科治疗中心
the Ludovico medical facility

791
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:27,262
它位于市中心外面
outside the town center.

792
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,967
我感到有一点儿伤心
I felt a malenky bit sad

793
01:07:29,268 --> 01:07:31,099
向旧监狱说声再见吧
having to say goodbye to the old Staja

794
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:34,702
就像离开一个熟悉的地方所做的那样
as you will, when you leave a place you've gotten used to.

795
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:36,898
好 犯人停下来
Right, halt the prisoner.

796
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:44,815
早上好 先生 我是监狱警长巴恩斯
Good morning, sir. I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

797
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:46,880
我把655321号犯人从
I've got 655321

798
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,782
帕尔莫监狱移送到鲁道维科治疗中心
on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

799
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:53,717
早上好 我们正在等你们
Good morning. Yes, we've been expecting you.

800
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:55,223
我是阿尔科特医生
I'm Dr. Alcot.

801
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:58,519
阿尔科特医生
Dr. Alcot.

802
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:00,129
非常好 先生
Very good, sir.

803
01:08:03,936 --> 01:08:06,996
你准备好接收犯人了吗? 是的 当然
-Are you prepared for the prisoner? -Yes, of course.

804
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:11,300
请你在这些文件上签个字
I wonder if you'd mind signing these documents, sir.

805
01:08:12,144 --> 01:08:13,543
先生 那儿
There, sir.

806

There you are.

809
01:08:56,155 --> 01:08:58,055
监狱随从 过来

810
01:09:01,193 --> 01:09:02,353
停!
Halt!

811
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:06,158
请原谅 先生
Excuse me, sir.

812
01:09:12,705 --> 01:09:15,970
那位是专门监管他的警官吧?
Is that the officer who will take charge of the prisoner?

813
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:29,009
提个建议 医生 这家伙可要多加注意
A word of advice, Doc. You'll have to watch this one.

814
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:32,813
他曾经是一个残暴的混蛋 很有可能还会是
A right brutal bastard he has been, and will be again

815
01:09:33,025 --> 01:09:36,222
不要被他的忏悔和诵经所迷惑
in spite of all his sucking up and reading the Bible.

816
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:40,124
我们会看好他的 查里 带他到房间吧
We can manage things. Charlie, will you show the young man to his room, now?

817
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,129
是的 先生 请走这边
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

818

早上好 阿历克斯
Good morning, Alex.

我是布莱诺姆医生 布罗德斯基医生的助手
My name is Dr. Branom. I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

821
01:09:59,919 --> 01:10:01,511
早上好 女士们!天气不错!
Good morning, missus. Lovely day, isn't it?

822
01:10:01,754 --> 01:10:03,016
是的 确实不错
Indeed, it is.

823
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:04,847
可以拿开吗?
May I take that?

824
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:11,018
今天早上感觉如何?非常不错
-How are you feeling this morning? -Fine, fine.

825
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:14,255
好的 你等一会儿要和布罗德斯基医生见面
Good. In a few minutes you'll meet Dr. Brodsky

826
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:15,763
接着就会开始治疗
and begin your treatment.

827
01:10:16,368 --> 01:10:18,859
你被选中是非常幸运的
You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.

828
01:10:20,773 --> 01:10:23,367
我知道的 所以我很荣幸
I realize that, and I'm very grateful.

829
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:25,767
我们将成为朋友 是吗?
We're going to be friends, aren't we?

830
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,375
我希望会 女士
I hope so, missus.

831
01:10:30,549 --> 01:10:32,983
为什么打针?让我睡觉?
What's the hypo for? Sending me to sleep?

832
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:34,482
你放心 不是麻醉针
Nothing of the sort.

833
01:10:34,954 --> 01:10:37,650
是维他命营养素吗?　差不多
-Vitamins will it be, then? -Something like that.

834
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:42,092
你营养不足 所以每顿饭后我们都给你打一针
You're undernourished, so after each meal we'll give you a shot.

835
01:10:42,394 --> 01:10:43,793
身子转向右边
Roll over on your right side.

836
01:10:44,096 --> 01:10:46,894
把睡裤拉到半高
Loosen your pajama pants and pull them halfway down.

837
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:59,901
治疗是怎样进行的?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be, then?

838
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,811
其实 那非常简单
It's quite simple, really.

839
01:11:03,415 --> 01:11:05,178
我们将让你看一些电影
We're going to show you some films.

840
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,783
你的意思是像去电影院一样?
You mean like going to the pictures?

841
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,812
差不多吧
Something like that.

842
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:10,918
那不错
That's good.

843
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,988
我喜欢不时的看看老片子
I like to viddy the old films now and again.

844
01:11:16,028 --> 01:11:18,496
我爱看电影
And viddy films I would.

845
01:11:18,998 --> 01:11:20,989
兄弟们 我被带到了一个
Where I was taken to, brothers

846
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,327
从没有看过电影的地方
was like no cine I ever viddied before.

847
01:11:23,802 --> 01:11:25,929
我被用紧身衣绑了起来
I was bound up in a straitjacket

848
01:11:26,205 --> 01:11:28,332
并戴上一个
and my gulliver was strapped to a headrest

849
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,938
插满导线的头盔
with wires running away from it.

850
01:11:31,143 --> 01:11:33,509
然后在我眼角夹上了支架
Then they clamped, like, lid-locks on me eyes

851
01:11:33,712 --> 01:11:37,148
于是我的眼睛就不能闭上 无论怎样努力也不行
so that I could not shut them, no matter how hard I tried.

852
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:39,144
我觉得这有点疯狂
It seemed a bit crazy to me

853
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:42,318
但我甘愿受他们摆布
but I let them get on with what they wanted to get on with.

854
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:45,955
如果我能在两星期内重获自由
If I was to be a free malchick again in a fortnight

855
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,616
我甘愿做更多的试验 兄弟们
I would put up with much in the meantime, my brothers.

856
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:18,386
第一场电影非常棒 镜头拍得很专业
The first film was a very good, professional piece of cine

857
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,590
就像一部好莱坞电影
like it was done in Hollywood.

858
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,986
声音效果非常逼真
The sounds were real horrorshow.

859
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:26,392
你可以听到尖叫和呻吟非常逼真
You could slooshy the screams and moans very realistic.

860
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:28,895
你甚至可以听到呼吸声和呻吟声
You could even get the breathing and panting

861
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:32,170
只是分不清是打人者的还是被打者的
of the tolchocking malchicks at the same time.

862
01:12:32,404 --> 01:12:34,269
那么 从中知道了什么?
And then what do you know?

863
01:12:34,506 --> 01:12:36,667
不久 我们亲爱的老朋友
Soon our dear old friend

864
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,900
红红的 成片的血
the red, red vino on tap

865
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:40,304
染满了被打者的全身
the same in all places

866
01:12:40,512 --> 01:12:42,002
鲜血渐渐连成一片
like it's put out by the same firm

867
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:44,208
开始涌出
began to flow.

868
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,577
那真是太美丽了
It was beautiful.

869
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:49,217
真实世界的颜色是一个有趣的话题
It's funny how the colors of the real world

870
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:51,518
只是看上去非常真实
only seem really real

871
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,917
当你在看电影的时候
when you viddy them on a screen.

872
01:12:56,929 --> 01:12:59,329
每当我看到达些场景时
Now, all the time I was watching this

873
01:12:59,598 --> 01:13:01,828
我开始有点意识到
I was beginning to get very aware

874
01:13:02,134 --> 01:13:04,295
觉得那样并不好
of, like, not feeling all that well.

875
01:13:04,536 --> 01:13:08,438
这也许是我营养太好的缘故
And this I put down to all the rich food and vitamins.

876
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,940
我尝试不再想了 开始观赏下部片子
But I tried to forget this, concentrating on the next film

877
01:13:13,245 --> 01:13:15,907
出现了一个轮奸的场景
which jumped right away on a young devotchka

878
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:18,946
一个红发女人在草地上被人轮奸
who was being given the old in-out, in-out

879
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:21,943
男人上了一个
first by one malchick

880
01:13:22,821 --> 01:13:23,947
又上一个
then another.

881
01:13:25,057 --> 01:13:26,547
接着又一个
Then another.

882
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:31,961
当轮到第六或第七个男人的时候
When it came to the 6th or 7th malchick

883
01:13:32,264 --> 01:13:35,722
他色迷迷的看着笑着 然后俯下身去
leering and smecking and then going into it

884
01:13:35,968 --> 01:13:39,165
我开始感到想呕吐了
I began to feel really sick.

885
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:42,262
但我不得不看
But I could not shut me glazzies.

886
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:45,975
即使稍微转动眼球
And even if I tried to move my glazzballs about

887
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:48,236
我还是不能摆脱
I still could not get out of

888
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,176
电影中的场景
the line of fire of this picture.

889
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:55,478
让我起来吧
Get me up.

890
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:57,651
我想吐了
I'm going to be sick.

891
01:13:58,657 --> 01:14:00,682
快拿东西过来让我吐啊!
Get something for me to be sick in!

892
01:14:04,997 --> 01:14:07,864
很快 药物会使试验者
Very soon now, the drug will cause the subject

893
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,295
感到一种类似死亡的麻痹
to experience a deathlike paralysis

894
01:14:10,602 --> 01:14:14,402
并伴有深刻的恐惧和无助感
together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness.

895
01:14:15,307 --> 01:14:19,107
我们早期的一个试验者曾描述过那感觉就像死了一样
One of our early test subjects described it as being like death.

896
01:14:19,311 --> 01:14:22,303
一种窒息或水淹的感觉
A sense of stifling or drowning.

897
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:25,711
而在这段时间内 我们发现
And it is during this period, we have found

898
01:14:25,984 --> 01:14:29,613
试验者会把自身遭遇与暴力场面联系起来
the subject will make his most rewarding associations

899
01:14:29,821 --> 01:14:33,621
譬如他的家庭背景 经历 环境等
between his catastrophic experience, environment

900
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:36,884
暴力场面给他很大的震撼
and the violence he sees.

901
01:14:38,697 --> 01:14:40,688
布罗德斯基医生对你很满意
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

902
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:43,331
你在治疗中的反应很令人欣喜
You've made a very positive response.

903
01:14:44,436 --> 01:14:48,338
明天将会有两部分 早上和下午
Tomorrow there will be two sessions, morning and afternoon.

904
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,634
你的意思是一天之内看两部?
You mean I have to viddy two sessions in one day?

905
01:14:51,843 --> 01:14:55,006
我觉得你每天看完之后情绪都会有点波动
I imagine you'll feel a bit limp by the end of the day.

906
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:58,546
但我们必须对你严格要求 你需要治疗
But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.

907
01:14:58,850 --> 01:14:59,908
那太可怕了
It was horrible.

908
01:15:00,152 --> 01:15:01,710
的确很可怕
Of course it was horrible.

909
01:15:01,954 --> 01:15:04,354
暴力本身就可怕
Violence is a very horrible thing.

910
01:15:04,656 --> 01:15:06,351
这正是你要学习的
That's what you're learning now.

911
01:15:06,558 --> 01:15:07,855
你的躯体也在学习
Your body's learning it.

912
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,224
我只是不明白为什么想吐
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did.

913
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,728
我从来不会呕吐 相反 以前我对这些场景会很喜欢
I never used to feel sick. I used to feel the very opposite.

914
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:17,868
从前 在干或看的时候我都会很卖力
Doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow.

915
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:22,262
你下午感到不适 正是你变好的迹象
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better.

916
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:25,669
正常人对这些暴力场面
When we're healthy, we respond to the hateful

917
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:27,935
都是持憎恶态度的
with fear and nausea.

918
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:30,375
你正在恢复正常 仅此而已
You're becoming healthy, that's all.

919
01:15:30,582 --> 01:15:32,482
但明天的这个时候你会比现在更正常
By this time tomorrow, you'll be healthier still.

920
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:28,330
到了第二天 兄弟们
It was the next day, brothers

921
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,098
我的确表现不错
and I had truly done my best

922
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:32,742
早上下午的表现
morning and afternoon to play it their way

923
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:35,843
都中规中矩
and sit like a horrorshow cooperative malchick

924
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:37,606
当他们变换特级暴力场景的时候
in the chair of torture

925
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:42,047
我在椅子上活受罪
while they flashed nasty bits of ultra-violence on the screen

926
01:16:42,521 --> 01:16:47,015
尽管没压原本声音 这次听到的全是音乐
though not on the soundtrack, the only sound being music.

927
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:50,553
然后 我注意到 在痛苦与不适之中
Then I noticed, in all my pain and sickness

928
01:16:50,829 --> 01:16:54,731
那声响像是坠毁声和爆炸声
what music it was that, like, cracked and boomed.

929
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,158
那就像路德维希・凡・贝多芬的音乐
It was Ludwig van.

930
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:01,230
第九交响曲第四章
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

931
01:17:16,888 --> 01:17:19,982
停!停 我求求你
Stop it! Stop it! Please, I beg you!

932
01:17:20,492 --> 01:17:21,686
这是一种罪恶!
It's a sin!

933
01:17:22,094 --> 01:17:23,686
这是一种罪恶!
It's a sin!

934
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:30,259
罪恶?
Sin?

935
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:32,094
罪恶是怎么回事?
What's all this about sin?

936
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:33,502
就是这个
That!

937
01:17:33,705 --> 01:17:37,698
这样用路德维希・凡的音乐 他没有伤害过谁
Using Ludwig van like that. He did no harm to anyone.

938
01:17:38,009 --> 01:17:40,409
贝多芬只是谱曲
Beethoven just wrote music.

939
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:44,276
你是不是指背景音乐?
Are you referring to the background score?

940
01:17:45,817 --> 01:17:47,785
你以前听过他吗?
You've heard Beethoven before?

941
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:51,889
这么说你对音乐很敏感了
So you're keen on music?

942
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:59,026
无可救药
Can't be helped.

943
01:17:59,731 --> 01:18:02,529
这可能是所谓的罪恶之因吧
Here's the punishment element perhaps.

944
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:05,696
总督应该很高兴
The governor ought to be pleased.

945
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,408
对不起 阿历克斯
I'm sorry, Alex.

946
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:12,404
那是为了你好
This is for your own good.

947
01:18:12,644 --> 01:18:15,044
你得忍耐我们一会了
You'll have to bear with us for a while.

948
01:18:15,847 --> 01:18:19,544
但这不公平
But it's not fair. It's not fair I should feel ill

949
01:18:19,751 --> 01:18:22,720
我听到美妙的贝多芬音乐时 怎能感到恶心呢?
when I hear lovely, lovely Ludwig van.

950
01:18:23,255 --> 01:18:25,553
你一定得冒这个险 小子
You must take your chance, boy.

951
01:18:26,057 --> 01:18:28,548
选择是你的
The choice has been all yours.

952
01:18:30,061 --> 01:18:32,757
你不必多说了 先生
You needn't take it any further, sir.

953
01:18:33,131 --> 01:18:36,066
你已经向我证明了极端暴力和杀戮是错的
You've proved to me all this ultra-violence and killing

954
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:39,565
不对的 绝对错的
is wrong, wrong and terribly wrong!

955
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:41,768
我已经吸取教训了 先生
I've learned me lesson, sir.

956
01:18:41,973 --> 01:18:44,874
我现在已经看到了我从看到过的
I see now what I've never seen before.

957
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:48,078
我已经治好了 感谢上帝
I'm cured. Praise God!

958
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,780
你还没被治愈 小子
You're not cured yet, boy.

959
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,150
但先生
But, sirs.

960
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:54,750
女士
Missus!

961
01:18:55,086 --> 01:18:57,179
我知道错了
I see that it's wrong!

962
01:18:57,456 --> 01:19:01,483
这是错的 因为它反社会
It's wrong because it's, like, against society.

963
01:19:01,793 --> 01:19:04,387
因为人人都有活下去并快乐的权力
Because everybody has the right to live and be happy

964
01:19:04,663 --> 01:19:07,461
而不被打击和刀刺
without being tolchocked and knifed!

965
01:19:07,766 --> 01:19:10,792
不 不 小子 这个还是由我们来做吧
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us.

966
01:19:11,102 --> 01:19:12,694
但开心一点吧
But be cheerful about it.

967
01:19:13,004 --> 01:19:16,269
不到两星期以后 你就自由了
In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.

968
01:19:54,646 --> 01:19:55,908
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen

969
01:19:56,147 --> 01:19:59,048
在这里我们介绍实验者本人
at this stage, we introduce the subject himself.

970
01:19:59,251 --> 01:20:02,220
你们已发现他健康而且保养很好
He is, as you will perceive, fit and well-nourished.

971
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,354
他刚刚睡了一个好觉 吃饱了早餐
He comes straight from a night's sleep and a good breakfast

972
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:06,546
没有吸毒
undrugged

973
01:20:06,825 --> 01:20:08,656
没有被催眠
unhypnotized.

974
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:12,557
明天我们将满怀信心地将他重新送返世界
Tomorrow we send him out with confidence into the world again

975
01:20:12,831 --> 01:20:16,460
就像你在早晨遇到的小伙子一样
as decent a lad as you would meet on a May morning.

976
01:20:17,269 --> 01:20:20,033
女士们 先生们 改变是巨大的
What a change is here, ladies and gentlemen.

977
01:20:20,272 --> 01:20:22,672
对他进行了惩治
From the hoodlum the state committed

978
01:20:22,874 --> 01:20:25,672
国家在两年前
to unprofitable punishment two years ago.

979
01:20:25,877 --> 01:20:28,675
两年之中他没有改变
Unchanged after two years.

980
01:20:29,381 --> 01:20:31,576
没有改变 不是吗?
Unchanged, do I say?

981
01:20:31,883 --> 01:20:33,350
然而不是这样
Not quite.

982
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:38,284
监狱教会了他阴险和虚伪的手段
Prison taught him the false smile, the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

983
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:41,889
这种诱人 温情的微笑和媚眼
The fawning, greased, obsequious leer.

984
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,191
他也学会了其它罪恶
Other vices it taught him

985
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:48,364
同时也更加肯定了他以前的恶习
as well as confirming him in those he had long practiced before.

986
01:20:49,568 --> 01:20:52,594
我们党承诺恢复秩序和法律
Our party promised to restore law and order

987
01:20:52,871 --> 01:20:56,898
并将街道变为对常人来说安全的地方
and to make the streets safe for the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

988
01:20:57,208 --> 01:21:01,201
这个承诺现在将要实现
This pledge is now about to become a reality.

989
01:21:01,413 --> 01:21:05,110
女士们 先生们 今天是一个历史性时刻
Ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic moment.

990
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:09,911
犯罪暴力问题既将成为历史
The problem of criminal violence is soon to be a thing of the past.

991
01:21:10,922 --> 01:21:12,822
但多说无益
But enough of words.

992
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:15,319
行动胜过一切
Actions speak louder than.

993
01:21:15,594 --> 01:21:17,289
现在就行动
Action now.

994
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:19,720
各位请看
Observe all.

995
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:31,935
部长 我们期盼这一天很久了
Our necks are out a long way on this, Minister.

996
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:34,236
我对布罗德斯基有十足信心
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

997
01:21:34,512 --> 01:21:37,640
如果民意测验正确的话 我们赢定了
If the polls are right, we have nothing to lose.

998
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:49,157
你好 垃圾
Hello, heap of dirt.

999
01:21:51,963 --> 01:21:56,263
你不常洗澡 不是吗? 从你身上的味道可以闻出
You don't wash much, do you, judging by the horrible smell.

1000
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:59,269
你为什么这么说 我今早刚洗过
Why do you say that? I had a shower this morning.

1001
01:21:59,471 --> 01:22:02,167
他今早洗过澡
He had a shower this morning.

1002
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,666
你是不是说我在撒谎?
You trying to call me a liar?

1003
01:22:04,976 --> 01:22:05,772
不 兄弟
No, brother.

1004
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:09,271
你一定在想我愚蠢至极
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

1005
01:22:14,953 --> 01:22:16,784
你为什么这么做 兄弟?
Why did you do that, brother?

1006
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:18,956
我从没有对不起你
I've never done wrong to you.

1007
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,283
想知道我为什么这么做吗?
You want to know why I did that?

1008
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:22,682
要知道
Well, you see

1009
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:24,188
我这么做
I do this

1010
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:25,690
也这么做
and that

1011
01:22:25,997 --> 01:22:29,194
是因为我不喜欢你这种人 不是吗?
and this because I don't like your horrible type, do I?

1012
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:31,699
如果你想开始干什么的话
And if you want to start something

1013
01:22:32,003 --> 01:22:34,494
那就请吧 来吧
you just go ahead. Go on!

1014
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:35,968
请吧
Please do!

1015
01:22:37,609 --> 01:22:39,406
我觉得不行了
I'm going to be sick.

1016
01:22:40,211 --> 01:22:41,906
不行了吗?
You're going to be sick, are you?

1017
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,580
不行了 让我站起来吧
I'm going to be sick. Please let me get up.

1018
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:46,908
你想站起来吗?
You want to get up?

1019
01:22:47,318 --> 01:22:49,013
你现在给我听好
Well, now you listen to me.

1020
01:22:49,721 --> 01:22:51,313
如果你想站起来的话
If you want to get up

1021
01:22:51,823 --> 01:22:53,723
你得为我做件事
you've got to do something for me.

1022
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:55,618
这里
Here.

1023
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:57,321
这里
Here.

1024
01:22:57,996 --> 01:22:59,623
你看见了吗?
You see that?

1025
01:23:00,632 --> 01:23:02,099
你看见这只鞋吗?
You see that shoe?

1026
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:04,900
我要你舔它
I want you to lick it.

1027
01:23:05,136 --> 01:23:06,433
继续
Go on!

1028
01:23:07,505 --> 01:23:08,995
舔它
Lick it!

1029
01:23:12,043 --> 01:23:14,409
我的兄弟们 你们相不相信
And, my brothers, would you believe

1030
01:23:14,646 --> 01:23:18,013
你真正的朋友 这个饱受折磨的讲述者
your faithful friend and long-suffering narrator

1031
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:20,615
把他的红舌头伸出了一里半
pushed out his red yabzick a mile and a half

1032
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:23,719
去舔这只脏靴子
to lick the grahzny, vonny boots.

1033
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:25,546
再来一次
And again!

1034
01:23:25,757 --> 01:23:28,225
痛不欲生的恶心感又一次出现了
The horrible killing sickness had whooshed up

1035
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,052
将打斗的快乐
and turned the joy of battle

1036
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,524
转变为我不屑一顾的感觉
into a feeling I was going to snuff it.

1037
01:23:33,765 --> 01:23:35,062
再来一次
And again.

1038
01:23:35,567 --> 01:23:37,558
好极了 很干净
Nice and clean.

1039
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:41,364
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

1040
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:43,438
这非常好
That will do very well.

1041
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:49,943
非常感谢 女士们 先生们
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

1042
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:02,112
她走向我
She came towards me

1043
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:06,119
照在她身上的光就像上帝的光芒
with the light, like it was the light of heavenly grace.

1044
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:08,552
进入我脑海的东西
And the thing that flashed in me gulliver

1045
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,454
是让她躺在地板上
was that I'd like to have her there on the floor

1046
01:25:11,663 --> 01:25:14,962
干老一套 疯狂的干
with the old in-out, real savage.

1047
01:25:30,982 --> 01:25:33,382
但恶心感飞快的袭来
But quick as a shot came the sickness.

1048
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:36,176
就像在街角监视的侦探一样
Like a detective who'd been watching around the corner

1049
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:39,684
现在现身来逮捕我
and now followed to make his arrest.

1050
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:53,702
够了
Enough!

1051
01:25:54,005 --> 01:25:55,700
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1052
01:25:55,907 --> 01:25:57,704
谢谢 亲爱的
Thank you, my dear.

1053
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:22,192
你现在感觉好点了吗?
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1054
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,898
不 先生 我觉得好极了
No, sir. I feel really great, sir.

1055
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:27,037
好 还可以吗 先生?
-Good. -Was it all right, sir?

1056
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:28,102
我做的好吗?
Did I do well?

1057
01:26:28,339 --> 01:26:31,706
很好 孩子 好极了
Fine, my boy. Absolutely fine.

1058
01:26:31,943 --> 01:26:33,205
你们看到了 女士们 先生们
You see, ladies and gentlemen

1059
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,912
我们的实验者被驱使做善事
our subject is impelled towards the good

1060
01:26:36,214 --> 01:26:39,809
同时也矛盾地被驱使做恶
by paradoxically being impelled towards evil.

1061
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:41,745
暴力的企图
The intention to act violently

1062
01:26:42,053 --> 01:26:45,454
被身体的不适伴随
is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress.

1063
01:26:45,723 --> 01:26:48,351
为了抵消这个实验者必须转向
To counter these, the subject has to switch

1064
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:51,561
一种截然不同的态度
to a diametrically opposed attitude.

1065
01:26:52,263 --> 01:26:53,628
有问题吗?
Any questions?

1066
01:26:53,865 --> 01:26:55,264
选择
Choice!

1067
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:02,262
这孩子没有真正的选择 不是吗?
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1068
01:27:02,473 --> 01:27:04,065
自我利益
Self-interest.

1069
01:27:04,342 --> 01:27:06,173
对生理疼痛的害怕
The fear of physical pain

1070
01:27:06,444 --> 01:27:10,972
驱使他进行古怪的自虐行为
drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement.

1071
01:27:11,749 --> 01:27:13,774
这个做法很明显缺乏诚意
Its insincerity was clearly to be seen.

1072
01:27:13,985 --> 01:27:15,885
他不再是一个犯错者了
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1073
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:20,750
也不是一个能做道德选择的生灵了
He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.

1074
01:27:20,992 --> 01:27:23,290
帕德 这些很难说
Padre, these are subtleties.

1075
01:27:23,594 --> 01:27:26,688
我们不关心动机 也不关心更高的道德规范
We're not concerned with motives, with the higher ethics.

1076
01:27:26,998 --> 01:27:30,695
我们只关心打击犯罪
We are concerned only with cutting down crime.

1077
01:27:32,971 --> 01:27:37,601
为了缓解监狱里的拥挤状况
And with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.

1078
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:40,600
他将成为一个真正的基督敦徒
He will be your true Christian

1079
01:27:40,878 --> 01:27:42,971
甘愿受罚
ready to turn the other cheek.

1080
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:46,207
甘愿受难 而不是让别人受难
Ready to be crucified, rather than crucify.

1081
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:50,513
连杀一只苍蝇也会心痛
Sick to the very heart at the thought even of killing a fly.

1082
01:27:50,822 --> 01:27:52,187
解救
Reclamation.

1083
01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:54,618
上帝的天使般的欢乐
Joy before the angels of God.

1084
01:27:54,892 --> 01:27:58,020
关键是它非常有效
The point is that it works!

1085
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,733
第二天 你的朋友 谦卑的讲述者
And the very next day, your friend and humble narrator

1086
01:28:06,004 --> 01:28:08,029
终获自由
was a free man.

1087
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:19,940
我想嫁一个守灯塔的 让他给我做伴
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper and keep him company.

1088
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:24,040
我想嫁个守灯塔的 伴着海边的景色生活
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper and live by the sight of the sea.

1089
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,740
我会在阳光下擦亮灯 给夜航的船只指明路
I'll polish his lamp by the light of day, so ships at night can find their way.

1090
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:34,140
我想嫁一个守灯塔的 那不好吗?
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper and won't that be OK?

1091
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:39,240
我们会在珊瑚礁上开派对 在海滩上举行野餐
We'll have parties on the coral reef and clambakes on the shore.

1092
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:43,540
我们会邀请邻居来 几十只海鸥
We'll invite the neighbors in, seagulls by the score.

1093
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:46,443
亲爱的 我每天都梦想着住在灯塔里
I dream of live in a lighthouse baby every single day.

1094
01:28:46,444 --> 01:28:47,877
儿子
Son!

1095
01:28:49,447 --> 01:28:51,779
嗨 爸爸妈妈
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1096
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:54,346
妈妈
Mum.

1097
01:28:56,087 --> 01:28:58,487
亲爱的 你好吗?很高兴见到你
How are you, love? Nice to see you.

1098
01:29:00,191 --> 01:29:02,489
爸爸 孩子 真令人惊讶
-Dad. -Lad. What a surprise.

1099
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,853
很高兴见到　身体还好吧?
-Good to see you. -Keeping fit?

1100
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:06,858
你怎么样?
How are you, then?

1101
01:29:07,098 --> 01:29:09,191
我很好 很好
I'm fine, fine.

1102
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:11,401
没什么麻烦 你知道
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

1103
01:29:14,205 --> 01:29:15,900
我回来了
I'm back!

1104
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:19,598
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

1105
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:23,074
你为什么不让我们知道在发生什么?
Why didn't you let us know what was happening?

1106
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:26,508
我想要给爸爸和你一个惊喜
I wanted it to be, like, a big surprise for you and Pee.

1107
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:29,719
确实是一个惊喜 只是有一点令人措手不及
It's a surprise, all right. A bit bewildering too.

1108
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:32,788
我们刚刚在早报上读到它
We've only just read about it in morning papers.

1109
01:29:33,024 --> 01:29:34,821
你应该早让我们知道 孩子
You should have let us know, lad.

1110
01:29:35,493 --> 01:29:39,429
不是我们不高兴见到你 而且
Not that we're not very pleased to see you again, and all

1111
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:41,129
治好了吗?全部?
cured too, eh?

1112
01:29:41,432 --> 01:29:43,491
对了 他们对我帮助很大
That's right. They did a great job on me.

1113
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:46,395
我完全改变了
I'm completely reformed.

1114
01:29:50,108 --> 01:29:51,803
还是老地方吗?
Still the same old place, then?

1115
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:07,155
沙发上坐着一个奇怪的人
There's a strange fellow sitting on the sofa

1116
01:30:07,425 --> 01:30:10,519
大口吃着吐司条
munchy-wunching lomticks of toast.

1117
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:15,328
这是乔
That's Joe.

1118
01:30:17,268 --> 01:30:19,168
他现在住这里
He lives here now.

1119
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,767
寄宿的
The lodger.

1120
01:30:21,038 --> 01:30:22,665
他是一个寄宿的
That's what he is.

1121
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,031
他租了你的房间
He rents your room.

1122
01:30:35,686 --> 01:30:37,176
乔 你好
How do you do, Joe?

1123
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:39,480
房间还舒服吧
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1124
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,681
没什么抱怨?
No complaints?

1125
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:46,660
我听说过你
I've heard about you.

1126
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:49,461
我知道你干了什么
I know what you've done.

1127
01:30:53,804 --> 01:30:57,467
也伤透了你可怜的父母的心
Breaking the hearts of your poor, grieving parents.

1128
01:30:58,476 --> 01:31:00,205
现在你回来了
So you're back, eh?

1129
01:31:00,478 --> 01:31:05,108
再一次让你父母的生活变得悲惨?
Back to make life a misery for your lovely parents once more?

1130
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:06,883
除非把我杀了 否则别想
Over my dead corpse, you will.

1131
01:31:07,185 --> 01:31:10,484
你知道他们对待我像自己的儿子一样
Because, you see, they've let me be more like a son to them

1132
01:31:10,688 --> 01:31:12,679
而不是一个寄宿者
than like a lodger.

1133
01:31:14,225 --> 01:31:16,819
不要在这里打了 孩子们
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1134
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,531
请用手盖住你的嘴
Do put your hand over your mouth, please.

1135
01:31:24,835 --> 01:31:26,029
这样抽搐很恶心
It's bloody revolting.

1136
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:33,134
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1137
01:31:34,345 --> 01:31:36,006
这是治疗的效果
It's the treatment.

1138
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:38,841
很恶心 足够让你把食物都吐出来
It's disgusting. Enough to put you off your food.

1139
01:31:39,116 --> 01:31:42,916
别理他 乔 这是治疗的效果
Leave him be, Joe. It's the treatment.

1140
01:31:45,022 --> 01:31:47,855
你认为我们该做点什么吗?
Do you think we ought to do something?

1141
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:52,226
你要一杯茶吗 儿子?
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?

1142
01:32:02,974 --> 01:32:06,068
你把我的私人东西怎么处置了?
What have you done with all me own personal things?

1143
01:32:10,381 --> 01:32:13,145
它们全被
That was all

1144
01:32:13,384 --> 01:32:15,045
拿走了 儿子
took away, son.

1145
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:17,383
警察拿走的
By the police.

1146
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:19,756
新规定 明白
New regulation, see

1147
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:23,051
是对受害者的补偿
about compensation for the victims.

1148
01:32:25,696 --> 01:32:27,391
巴斯尔怎么样了
What about Basil?

1149
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:32,096
我的蛇在哪里?
Where is my snake?

1150
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:43,607
它好像遇到了
He met with

1151
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:45,611
一场事故
like, an accident.

1152
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:51,087
它死了
He passed away.

1153
01:32:56,427 --> 01:32:58,520
那我又将会怎么样呢?
What's going to happen to me, then?

1154
01:33:00,798 --> 01:33:02,026
我是说
I mean

1155
01:33:03,134 --> 01:33:04,601
他进的是我的屋
that's my room he's in.

1156
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:06,700
不可否认这一点
There's no denying that.

1157
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:10,332
这也是我的家
This is my home also.

1158
01:33:12,243 --> 01:33:15,701
爸爸妈妈 你们有什么建议?
What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?

1159
01:33:21,652 --> 01:33:24,212
这需要考虑 儿子
All this needs thinking about, son.

1160
01:33:25,456 --> 01:33:28,323
我们不能一下子把乔赶走
We can't very well just kick Joe out.

1161
01:33:28,559 --> 01:33:30,356
不能那样做
Not just like that, can we?

1162
01:33:30,661 --> 01:33:31,650
我是说
I mean

1163
01:33:31,962 --> 01:33:33,862
乔在这里有工作做
Joe's here doing a job.

1164
01:33:34,165 --> 01:33:36,463
实际上是一个合约 两年期
A contract it is. Two years.

1165
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:40,364
我们做了安排 不是吗 乔?
We made, like, an arrangement. Didn't we, Joe?

1166
01:33:42,173 --> 01:33:44,141
你要知道 儿子
You see, son

1167
01:33:45,476 --> 01:33:48,968
乔已经付了下个月房租
Joe's paid next month's rent already

1168
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:53,379
不论未来我们做什么 我们不能只是说
so whatever we may do in the future, we can't just say

1169
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:56,643
让他离开 不是吗?
to Joe to get out, now can we?

1170
01:33:57,054 --> 01:33:58,885
不 不止这个
No, but it's much more than that.

1171
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:02,190
我是说 你们两个让我想起
I mean, I've got you two to think of

1172
01:34:02,493 --> 01:34:05,360
谁像父母一样对待我
who've been like a father and mother to me.

1173
01:34:05,596 --> 01:34:08,588
我离开这里和你们两个是不对的
It wouldn't be right for me to go off and leave you two

1174
01:34:08,866 --> 01:34:11,699
而让你们被这个怪物怜悯
to the tender mercies of this young monster

1175
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:15,199
他一点也不像真正的儿子
who's been like no real son at all.

1176
01:34:15,906 --> 01:34:18,204
看 他在哭
Look, he's weeping now.

1177
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:21,401
但这正是他狡猾技俩
But that's all his craft and artfulness.

1178
01:34:21,712 --> 01:34:24,510
让他走到别处找地方住
Let him go and find a room somewhere else.

1179
01:34:24,715 --> 01:34:29,015
让他自食其果 知道一个坏孩子
Let him learn the errors of his way, and that a bad boy

1180
01:34:29,286 --> 01:34:32,778
像他这样是不配有你们这样的好父母的
doesn't deserve such a good mum and dad as he's had.

1181
01:34:38,429 --> 01:34:39,726
好吧
All right.

1182
01:34:40,831 --> 01:34:42,731
我知道情况了
I know how things are now.

1183
01:34:44,235 --> 01:34:46,795
我受了那么多罪
I've suffered and I've suffered

1184
01:34:47,037 --> 01:34:49,028
不断受罪
and I've suffered.

1185
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,937
每个人都想让我不断受罪
And everybody wants me to go on suffering.

1186
01:34:54,912 --> 01:34:57,039
你让别人受罪
You've made others suffer.

1187
01:34:57,548 --> 01:35:00,745
你受罪是应该的
It's only right that you should suffer proper.

1188
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:03,313
别人告诉了我你做的一切
I've been told everything you've done

1189
01:35:03,554 --> 01:35:05,545
晚上围坐在桌旁
sitting around the family table.

1190
01:35:05,756 --> 01:35:08,850
听上去令人震惊
And pretty shocking it was to listen to.

1191
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,957
其中许多令我作呕
It made me real sick, a lot of it did.

1192
01:35:14,965 --> 01:35:18,526
现在看看你母亲做了什么
Now look what you've gone and done to your mother.

1193
01:35:18,769 --> 01:35:20,361
别哭了 现在没事了
Come on. It's all right now.

1194
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,476
好吧
Right!

1195
01:35:35,252 --> 01:35:36,947
我现在就走
I'm leaving now.

1196
01:35:37,188 --> 01:35:39,349
你们再也不用见我了
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1197
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,285
我自己靠自己
I'll make me own way.

1198
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:45,387
非常感谢你 你们要对得起自己的良心
Thank you very much. Let it lie heavy on your consciences.

1199
01:35:46,797 --> 01:35:49,698
别那么想 儿子
Now don't take it like that, son.

1200
01:36:51,962 --> 01:36:54,931
给点钱吧 兄弟
Can you spare some cutter, me brother?

1201
01:36:56,767 --> 01:36:59,861
给点钱吧 兄弟
Can you spare some cutter, me brother?

1202
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:06,567
给点钱吧 兄弟
Can you spare some cutter, me brother?

1203
01:37:27,898 --> 01:37:29,388
谢谢 老兄
Thanks, brother.

1204
01:37:47,318 --> 01:37:49,115
坚尼 麦克
Jamey! Mack!

1205
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,087
愿天使
May the hokey fly!

1206
01:37:51,422 --> 01:37:54,983
圣母和上帝保佑我们
Mother of God and all the blessed saints in heaven preserve us!

1207
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:58,720
我从不忘记别人的样子 上帝啊!
I never forget a face, me God!

1208
01:37:58,996 --> 01:38:00,395
我从不忘记别人的样子
I never forget any face.

1209
01:38:00,598 --> 01:38:03,396
离开我 老兄 我从未见过你
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before!

1210
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:07,092
这就是差点干掉我的那个年轻混蛋
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in.

1211
01:38:07,338 --> 01:38:08,498
他和他的朋友
Him and his friends.

1212
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:11,639
他们打我 踢我 刺我
They beat me and kicked me and punched me.

1213
01:38:11,942 --> 01:38:13,432
抓住他 抓住他
Stop him! Stop him!

1214
01:38:13,644 --> 01:38:17,603
这条恶狗 他们看着我呻吟却哈哈大笑
They laughed at me blood and me moans, this murderous dog!

1215
01:38:17,848 --> 01:38:21,306
接着便是一群肮脏的老头子一拥而上
Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men

1216
01:38:21,452 --> 01:38:23,545
用他们苍老无力的手
trying to get at your humble narrator

1217
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:27,518
试图抓住我
with their feeble rookers and horny old claws.

1218
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:30,522
老家伙在教训年轻人
It was old age having a go at youth.

1219
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:34,458
我什么也不敢做 我的兄弟
And I daren't do a single solitary thing, my brothers.

1220
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:36,823
那样挨打更好
It being better to be hit at like that

1221
01:38:37,034 --> 01:38:39,628
也不要恶心 感觉到那可怕的疼痛
than want to sick and feel that horrible pain.

1222
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,269
好了 好了
All right, all right!

1223
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:42,436
现在住手
Stop it now!

1224
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:46,040
好了 不要扰乱治安 你们这些捣蛋鬼
Come on. Stop breaking the state's peace, you naughty boys!

1225
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:49,141
退后 走吧
Back away! Go away with you!

1226
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,678
你有什么麻烦吗?先生?
What's your trouble, sir?

1227
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:55,682
噢 不
Oh, no!

1228
01:38:59,289 --> 01:39:00,688
天哪!
Well!

1229
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:03,792
天哪! 天哪! 天哪!
Well, well, well!

1230
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:10,292
如果这不是小阿历克斯就怪了
If it isn't little Alex.

1231
01:39:10,501 --> 01:39:11,866
好久不见 老兄
Long time no viddy, droog.

1232
01:39:12,102 --> 01:39:13,569
怎么样?
How goes?

1233
01:39:13,804 --> 01:39:15,066
这不可能
It's impossible.

1234
01:39:15,305 --> 01:39:16,567
我不相信
I don't believe it.

1235
01:39:16,807 --> 01:39:18,672
说话的证据
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1236
01:39:18,909 --> 01:39:20,706
我们什么也没骗你
Nothing up our sleeves.

1237
01:39:20,978 --> 01:39:23,003
阿历克斯 不是巧合
No magic, little Alex.

1238
01:39:23,213 --> 01:39:26,705
只是两个到工作年龄的人找的工作罢了
A job for two who are now of job age.

1239
01:39:27,084 --> 01:39:28,517
当警察
The police.

1240
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:45,428
过来 阿历克斯
Come on, Alex.

1241
01:39:45,736 --> 01:39:47,226
下来走走
Come for walking.

1242
01:39:58,849 --> 01:40:01,249
来来来吧 伙计们
Come, come, come, my little droogies.

1243
01:40:01,518 --> 01:40:03,042
我一点也不明白
I just don't get this at all.

1244
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:05,448
过去的日子一去不返了
The old days are dead and gone.

1245
01:40:05,723 --> 01:40:08,556
但我已为过去所做的受过惩罚了
For what I did in the past, I've been punished.

1246
01:40:08,859 --> 01:40:10,520
我已经被治好了
I've been cured.

1247
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:11,955
检查官已经告诉了我们一切
That was read out to us.

1248
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:14,060
检查官宣读这一切给我们。
The inspector read it all out to us.

1249
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:17,028
他说这是一种很好的方法
He said it was a very good way.

1250
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:18,462
那这些是在干什么?
But what is all this?

1251
01:40:18,769 --> 01:40:21,260
是他们抓住我的 兄弟
It was them that went for me, brothers.

1252
01:40:21,538 --> 01:40:24,166
你不是他们一边的 不可能是
You're not on their side, and can't be.

1253
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:26,936
蒂姆 你不会是的
You can't be, Dim.

1254
01:40:27,177 --> 01:40:29,873
那是我们过去曾经戏弄过的人
It was someone we fillied with back in the old days

1255
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,572
现在要复仇了 记得吗?
trying to get his own revenge after all this time. Remember?

1256
01:40:33,784 --> 01:40:35,251
是很长时间
A long time is right.

1257
01:40:35,486 --> 01:40:37,784
我不记得那些日子了 太可怕了
I don't remember them days too horrorshow.

1258
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:40,081
也不要再喊我"蒂姆"了
And don't call me Dim no more, either.

1259
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,383
称我为"警官"
Officer, call me.

1260
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,196
你记得足够了 阿历克斯
Enough is remembered, though, little Alex.

1261
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:49,891
这是为了确保你能被治愈
And this is to make sure you stay cured.

1262
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,948
够了
That's enough.

1263
01:41:47,224 --> 01:41:49,852
再打几下 他还在乱踢
A bit more. He's still kicking.

1264
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:10,579
治好了 是吗?
Cured, are you?

1265
01:42:12,182 --> 01:42:16,050
下次再见 伙计
Be viddying you some more sometime, droogie.

1266
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:35,304
我该去哪里?没钱也没家
Where was I to go, who had no home and no money?

1267
01:42:35,572 --> 01:42:37,802
我为自己哭泣
I cried for meself.

1268
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:40,906
家 家 家
Home, home, home.

1269
01:42:41,178 --> 01:42:43,009
我要一个家
It was home I was wanting.

1270
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,272
我也到了一个家
And it was home I came to, brothers

1271
01:42:46,516 --> 01:42:49,212
我在当时的状态下没意识到
not realizing, in the state I was in

1272
01:42:49,419 --> 01:42:52,411
我在哪里和以前曾经到过那里
where I was and had been before.

1273
01:43:40,637 --> 01:43:42,628
见鬼 那究竟是谁?
Who on earth could that be?

1274
01:43:58,188 --> 01:43:59,883
我来看看是谁
I'll see who it is.

1275
01:44:11,468 --> 01:44:12,992
是谁?
Yes, what is it?

1276
01:44:21,678 --> 01:44:22,872
请帮个忙
Please 

1277
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:43,029
弗兰克 我想这个年轻人需要帮助
Frank, I think this young man needs some help.

1278
01:44:47,804 --> 01:44:49,203
我的上帝
My God!

1279
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:52,402
我的孩子 你怎么了?
What's happened to you, my boy?

1280
01:44:54,845 --> 01:44:58,542
你能相信吗?朋友 我的兄弟?
And would you believe it, O my brothers and only friends

1281
01:44:58,815 --> 01:45:01,045
你的自述人就在这里
there was your faithful narrator

1282
01:45:01,351 --> 01:45:03,751
像一个无助的婴儿一样被抱着
being held helpless like a babe in arms

1283
01:45:04,021 --> 01:45:06,353
突然意识到他在哪里
and suddenly realizing where he was

1284
01:45:06,656 --> 01:45:10,057
为什么门上的"家"是那么的熟悉
and why "home" on the gate had looked so familiar.

1285
01:45:10,327 --> 01:45:12,056
但我知道这里是安全的
But I knew I was safe.

1286
01:45:12,329 --> 01:45:14,354
我知道他不会记得我
I knew he would not remember me.

1287
01:45:14,564 --> 01:45:16,361
因为在那些无忧无虑的日子里
For in those carefree days

1288
01:45:16,566 --> 01:45:18,466
我和我所谓的兄弟
I and my so-called droogs

1289
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:22,227
戴着面具 像真的伪装一样
wore our maskies, which were like real horrorshow disguises.

1290
01:45:23,573 --> 01:45:24,733
是警察
Police.

1291
01:45:28,378 --> 01:45:30,573
可恶的警察
Ghastly, horrible police

1292
01:45:32,582 --> 01:45:34,174
他们打我 先生
they beat me up, sir.

1293
01:45:38,455 --> 01:45:40,855
警察殴打我 先生
The police beat me up.

1294
01:45:42,893 --> 01:45:44,588
我认识你
I know you!

1295
01:45:48,799 --> 01:45:50,892
报纸上的照片不是你吗?
Isn't it your picture in the newspapers?

1296
01:45:51,201 --> 01:45:53,396
我今早在录像上见到了你
Didn't I see you on the video this morning?

1297
01:45:53,603 --> 01:45:56,970
可怕的新技术 你不是那可怜的受害者吗?
Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?

1298
01:45:57,274 --> 01:45:58,502
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1299
01:45:59,009 --> 01:46:02,206
那正是我 先生 我是一个受害者 先生
That's exactly who I am and what I am, sir. A victim.

1300
01:46:02,412 --> 01:46:05,575
上帝啊 你来这是天意!
Then, by God, you've been sent here by providence!

1301
01:46:05,816 --> 01:46:08,910
在监狱里受折磨 还要受警察的折磨
Tortured in prison, then tortured by the police.

1302
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:13,613
我完全为了你 你还不是第一个来这的
My heart goes out to you. You're not the first to come here.

1303
01:46:13,924 --> 01:46:16,791
警察们喜欢把他们的犯人带到这个村子来
The police like to bring their victims to this village.

1304
01:46:17,027 --> 01:46:18,426
但你的天意在于
But it's providential that you

1305
01:46:18,728 --> 01:46:22,220
你作为另一种受害者 来到这里
who are also another kind of victim, should come here.

1306
01:46:24,134 --> 01:46:27,126
但你是冷得浑身发抖
But you're cold and shivering.

1307
01:46:27,737 --> 01:46:29,102
朱利安
Julian

1308
01:46:29,339 --> 01:46:31,603
为年轻人准备洗澡水
draw a bath for this young man.

1309
01:46:31,842 --> 01:46:33,139
当然了 法兰克
Certainly, Frank.

1310
01:46:33,543 --> 01:46:35,135
非常感谢 先生
Thank you very much, sir.

1311
01:46:35,445 --> 01:46:37,037
上帝保佑你 先生
God bless you, sir.

1312
01:47:22,192 --> 01:47:24,183
我在雨中歌唱
I'm singing in the rain

1313
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:30,189
在雨中歌唱
Just singing in the rain

1314
01:47:32,002 --> 01:47:34,300
要想确保现政府在大选中不回来
He can be the most potent weapon imaginable

1315
01:47:34,504 --> 01:47:37,701
他是现在可以想象的最有力的武器
to ensure the government is not returned in the election.

1316
01:47:37,974 --> 01:47:39,703
政府最大的吹嘘 先生
The government's big boast, sir

1317
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:42,706
就是他们处理犯罪的方法
is the way they have dealt with crime:

1318
01:47:42,979 --> 01:47:44,810
雇佣年轻的暴徒当警察
Recruiting young roughs into the police

1319
01:47:45,015 --> 01:47:48,109
提议这样的洗脑技术
proposing will-sapping techniques of conditioning.

1320
01:47:48,385 --> 01:47:50,580
以前我们在其它国家看到过
We've seen it before in other countries.

1321
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,310
这正是他们忽视的 而对我们很有意义
The thin end of the wedge.

1322
01:47:52,522 --> 01:47:56,618
我们因此有了极权主义的全部证据
Before we know it, we'll have the full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1323
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:05,099
这个年青人是这些残暴提议的活见证
This young boy is a living witness to these diabolical proposals.

1324
01:48:05,335 --> 01:48:09,101
人民 普通民众 必须知道 必须看到
The people, the common people, must know, must see.

1325
01:48:09,339 --> 01:48:13,708
我们有需要捍卫的自由传统 
There are traditions of liberty to defend. That tradition is all.

1326
01:48:13,944 --> 01:48:15,912
普通民众会听之任之 是的
The common people will let it go, yes.

1327
01:48:16,146 --> 01:48:18,239
他们会出卖自由换取安宁的生活
They'll sell liberty for a quieter life.

1328
01:48:18,548 --> 01:48:20,038
所以他们需要有人领导
That is why they must be led.

1329
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:22,409
驱使 推动
Driven. Pushed.

1330
01:48:27,457 --> 01:48:28,754
好
Fine.

1331
01:48:29,759 --> 01:48:31,420
非常谢谢 先生
Thank you very much, sir.

1332
01:48:33,463 --> 01:48:35,021
他会来的
He'll be here.

1333
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:41,567
我在雨中歌唱
I'm singing in the rain

1334
01:48:42,272 --> 01:48:45,264
在雨中歌唱
Just singing in the rain

1335
01:48:46,076 --> 01:48:49,273
多爽的感觉
What a glorious feeling

1336
01:48:49,646 --> 01:48:53,047
我又高高高兴起来了
I'm hap-hap-happy again

1337
01:48:53,583 --> 01:48:56,746
我在云中大笑
I'm laughing at clouds

1338
01:48:57,554 --> 01:49:00,079
上面是多么的黑
So dark up above

1339
01:49:01,091 --> 01:49:03,582
太阳在我心中
The sun's in my heart

1340
01:49:04,394 --> 01:49:08,296
我已准备去爱
I'm ready for love

1341
01:49:09,266 --> 01:49:11,996
让乌黑的云去追逐
Let the stormy clouds chase

1342
01:49:12,602 --> 01:49:15,469
它下面每一个人
Everyone from the place

1343
01:49:16,973 --> 01:49:21,910
雨尽情地下吧 我面带微笑
Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face

1344
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:25,239
我走在大路上
I'll walk down the lane

1345
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,740
有一副幸福的面容
With a happy refrain

1346
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:36,040
我在唱 在
And I'm singing

1347
01:49:59,816 --> 01:50:01,215
晚上好 先生
Good evening, sir.

1348
01:50:05,155 --> 01:50:06,713
晚上好
Good evening.

1349
01:50:07,257 --> 01:50:10,124
谢谢你给我留了这些
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me.

1350
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,760
周围没人 所以我就开始吃了
There was no one around, so I started.

1351
01:50:13,029 --> 01:50:14,860
这样可以吧 先生?
Hope that's all right, sir.

1352
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,063
当然
Of course.

1353
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,298
好吃吗?
Food all right?

1354
01:50:59,075 --> 01:51:00,702
很好 先生 很好
Great, sir. Great.

1355
01:51:03,713 --> 01:51:05,908
尝尝酒
Try the wine.

1356
01:51:12,322 --> 01:51:13,687
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

1357
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:17,520

祝你快乐
Happy days.

1359
01:51:31,307 --> 01:51:33,639
要一起来吗
Won't you join me?

1360
01:51:34,344 --> 01:51:36,539
不 我的健康不允许
No. My health doesn't allow it.

1361
01:51:37,414 --> 01:51:38,745
不 谢了
No, thank you.

1362
01:51:44,721 --> 01:51:47,212
1960年的沙图酒

Very good

1367
01:52:01,938 --> 01:52:03,132
颜色 先生
color, sir.

1368
01:52:07,343 --> 01:52:09,072
闻起来也很香
Smells nice too.

1369
01:52:23,993 --> 01:52:25,984
真的太棒了
Very nice little number.

1370
01:52:27,263 --> 01:52:28,594
干了这杯
Here's to it.

1371
01:52:37,307 --> 01:52:39,798
真的不赖 先生 真的
Very refreshing, sir. Very refreshing.

1372
01:52:40,109 --> 01:52:43,010
我很高兴你喜欢这好酒
I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.

1373
01:52:44,113 --> 01:52:46,013
再来一杯
Have another glass.

1374
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:55,681
谢谢
Thanks

1375
01:52:59,195 --> 01:53:00,526
我老婆
My wife

1376
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:05,525
曾经为我做好一切而让我专心写作
used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.

1377
01:53:08,438 --> 01:53:10,030
你妻子 先生?她走了?
Your wife? Is she away?

1378
01:53:10,507 --> 01:53:12,839
不 她死了
She's dead!

1379
01:53:16,913 --> 01:53:18,744
我很遗憾 先生
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.

1380
01:53:19,048 --> 01:53:21,346
她是被轮奸而死了
She was very badly raped, you see.

1381
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:24,051
我们被年轻的坏流氓袭击
We were assaulted by vicious young hoodlums

1382
01:53:24,254 --> 01:53:26,654
就在你现在所坐的这个房间里
in this very room you're sitting in now.

1383
01:53:26,856 --> 01:53:31,555
我留下了严重的残疾 但她的痛苦太深重了
I was left a helpless cripple, but for her the agony was too great.

1384
01:53:31,961 --> 01:53:33,826
医生说她死于肺炎
The doctors said it was pneumonia

1385
01:53:34,063 --> 01:53:36,861
因为当时正是流感流行
because it happened later, during a flu epidemic.

1386
01:53:37,166 --> 01:53:41,364
医生说是肺炎 但我知道究竟怎么回事
The doctors told me it was pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1387
01:53:41,671 --> 01:53:46,040
现在这个时代的牺牲品 可怜的姑娘!
A victim of the modern age. Poor, poor girl!

1388
01:53:49,979 --> 01:53:51,571
现在你是
And now you.

1389
01:53:52,181 --> 01:53:55,241
这个时代的另一个受害者
Another victim of the modern age.

1390
01:53:55,552 --> 01:53:57,452
但我们可以帮助你
But you can be helped.

1391
01:53:58,488 --> 01:54:01,889
刚才你洗澡时 我打了电话给朋友
I phoned some friends while you were having your bath.

1392
01:54:02,191 --> 01:54:02,987
一些
Some

1393
01:54:03,259 --> 01:54:04,351
朋友?
friends?

1394
01:54:04,594 --> 01:54:06,084
是的 他们想帮你
Yes. They want to help you.

1395
01:54:06,396 --> 01:54:08,591
帮我 先生?帮你
-Help me? -Help you.

1396
01:54:08,898 --> 01:54:12,390
他们是谁?非常重要的人物
-Who are they? -Very, very important people.

1397
01:54:12,602 --> 01:54:15,002
他们对你有兴趣
And they're interested in you.

1398
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,705
朱利安 一定是他们来了
Julian. This'll be these people now.

1399
01:54:22,912 --> 01:54:25,781
我不要想再麻烦你了 我要走了
I don't want to trouble you any further. I should be leaving.

1400
01:54:25,782 --> 01:54:27,416
不要走
No no no,my boy

1401
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:29,385
没有问题的
No trouble at all.

1402
01:54:30,086 --> 01:54:31,280
来
Here.

1403
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:33,421
我再给你倒一杯
Let me fill your glass.

1404
01:54:59,148 --> 01:55:00,843
就是他了
So this is the young man.

1405
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:03,718
你好
How do you do, sir?

1406
01:55:04,053 --> 01:55:06,715
很高兴见到你
Missus. I'm very pleased to meet you.

1407
01:55:07,123 --> 01:55:09,557
这么晚来打扰你 我希望你能见谅
I hope you forgive us for coming at this hour

1408
01:55:09,826 --> 01:55:11,657
我们听说你有些麻烦
but we heard you were in trouble

1409
01:55:11,961 --> 01:55:14,225
所以过来看看能否帮些忙
and so we came over to see if we could help.

1410
01:55:14,464 --> 01:55:16,762
谢谢你们关心
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.

1411
01:55:16,966 --> 01:55:19,230
我知道你
I understand you had a rather

1412
01:55:19,469 --> 01:55:20,731
不幸
unfortunate

1413
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:22,460
遭遇了
encounter

1414
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:24,468
警察今天晚上
with the police tonight.

1415
01:55:24,741 --> 01:55:26,766
对 我想你可以这么说
Yes, I suppose you could call it that.

1416
01:55:27,076 --> 01:55:28,338
现在怎么样?
How are you feeling now?

1417
01:55:28,645 --> 01:55:29,873
好多了 谢谢
Much better, thank you.

1418
01:55:30,146 --> 01:55:32,478
可以问你几个问题吗?
Feel like talking, answering a few questions?

1419
01:55:32,782 --> 01:55:34,079
好的 先生 好的
Fine, sir. Fine.

1420
01:55:34,951 --> 01:55:37,579
如我刚才所说 我们听过你的情况
As I said, we've heard about you.

1421
01:55:38,087 --> 01:55:40,783
对你的情况很感兴趣
We are interested in your case.

1422
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:43,891
我们想帮你 非常感谢 先生
-We want to help you. -Thank you very much, sir.

1423
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,288
可以开始了吗?
Shall we get down to it?

1424
01:55:47,497 --> 01:55:49,294
好的 可以 先生
Fine. Fine, sir.

1425
01:55:54,604 --> 01:55:57,402
从报纸上写的看
The newspapers mentioned

1426
01:55:57,607 --> 01:56:01,907
除了被改造成不能接受性和暴力活动
in addition to being conditioned against acts of sex and violence

1427
01:56:02,178 --> 01:56:05,511
你还被无意中改造成不能接受音乐
you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.

1428
01:56:06,582 --> 01:56:09,608
我想这是他们没有料到的
I think that was something that they didn't plan for.

1429
01:56:09,986 --> 01:56:11,886
你知道吗 女士
You see, missus

1430
01:56:12,121 --> 01:56:13,889
我非常喜欢音乐
I'm very fond of music.

1431
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:15,881
特别是贝多芬
 Especially Beethoven.

1432
01:56:16,726 --> 01:56:18,694
路德维希・凡・贝多芬
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1433
01:56:18,928 --> 01:56:21,294
B-E 行了 谢谢
-B-E- -All right, thank you.

1434
01:56:21,798 --> 01:56:25,825
只是恰好有一次他们给我
And it just so happened that while they were showing me

1435
01:56:26,135 --> 01:56:30,037
放一个坏电影 好像是关于一个集中营的
a particularly bad film of, like, a concentration camp

1436
01:56:30,306 --> 01:56:33,833
背景音乐都是贝多芬的
the background music was playing Beethoven.

1437
01:56:34,043 --> 01:56:36,841
所以你现在对音乐的反应
So now you have the same reaction to music

1438
01:56:37,046 --> 01:56:38,843
就和你对性和暴力一样?
as you do to sex and violence?

1439
01:56:39,048 --> 01:56:43,417
不 女士 并不是所有音乐 只是贝九
No, missus. You see, it's not all music. It's just the Ninth.

1440
01:56:43,653 --> 01:56:45,416
你是说贝多芬的第九交响曲?
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

1441
01:56:45,655 --> 01:56:48,647
对 我再不能听第九交响曲了
That's right. I can't listen to the Ninth anymore at all.

1442
01:56:48,925 --> 01:56:52,361
当我听见这音乐
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like

1443
01:56:52,662 --> 01:56:54,254
我就会有这种奇怪的感觉
this funny feeling.

1444
01:56:55,331 --> 01:56:59,563
然后我只想到 就像 要去了结
And then all I can think about is, like, trying to snuff it.

1445
01:56:59,869 --> 01:57:04,272
再说一遍 了结 就是去死 
-I beg your pardon? -Snuff it. Death, I mean.

1446
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:07,065
我是想平静地
I just want to die peacefully

1447
01:57:07,577 --> 01:57:09,875
无痛苦地死去
like, with no pain.

1448
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,580
你现在这样想吗?
Do you feel that way now?

1449
01:57:13,683 --> 01:57:15,674
不 先生 不怎么想
No, sir, not exactly.

1450
01:57:15,885 --> 01:57:17,182
我还是觉得
I still feel

1451
01:57:17,386 --> 01:57:18,683
我很惨
very miserable.

1452
01:57:18,888 --> 01:57:21,448
情绪非常低落
Very much down in spirits.

1453
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:23,288
你还想
Do you still feel

1454
01:57:23,559 --> 01:57:25,049
自杀吗?
suicidal?

1455
01:57:28,297 --> 01:57:30,094
嗯 这么说吧
Well. Put it this way:

1456
01:57:30,366 --> 01:57:33,199
我感到自己很消沉
I feel very low in myself.

1457
01:57:34,003 --> 01:57:36,369
我觉得前途渺茫
I can't see much in the future.

1458
01:57:36,606 --> 01:57:41,066
我觉得每一秒钟我都会遇到可怕的事
I feel that any second, something terrible is going to happen to me.

1459
01:57:54,323 --> 01:57:55,984
好样的 法兰克
Well done, Frank.

1460
01:58:01,998 --> 01:58:03,795
朱利安 请去开车
Julian, get the car, would you, please?

1461
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,751
我醒了
I woke up

1462
01:58:31,327 --> 01:58:35,058
疼痛遍及了 我的全身
the pain and sickness all over me like an animal.

1463
01:58:43,139 --> 01:58:45,972
我明白了
Then I realized what it was.

1464
01:58:47,276 --> 01:58:50,040
使我疼痛的便是楼下传来的音乐
The music coming up from the floor

1465
01:58:50,279 --> 01:58:53,476
我的老朋友 贝多芬
was our old friend, Ludwig van

1466
01:58:53,783 --> 01:58:56,377
和可怕的第九交响曲
and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

1467
01:59:04,293 --> 01:59:05,692
让我出去
Let me out!

1468
01:59:05,962 --> 01:59:07,691
打开门
Open the door!

1469
01:59:08,397 --> 01:59:10,558
快点 打开门!
Come on, open the door!

1470
01:59:13,102 --> 01:59:14,399
关掉
Turn it off!

1471
01:59:14,604 --> 01:59:16,401
关掉
Turn it off!

1472
01:59:19,075 --> 01:59:21,066
关掉
Turn it off!

1473
01:59:23,312 --> 01:59:24,210
停止
Stop it!

1474
02:00:12,528 --> 02:00:14,018
关掉
Turn it off!

1475
02:00:15,464 --> 02:00:16,431
求
Please!

1476
02:00:16,666 --> 02:00:18,861
你们关掉
Turn it off!

1477
02:00:32,782 --> 02:00:35,683
突然间 我明白了我必须做的
Suddenly, I viddied what I had to do

1478
02:00:35,952 --> 02:00:38,250
而且也是我一直想要做的
and what I had wanted to do.

1479
02:00:38,654 --> 02:00:41,088
那就是结果了我自己
And that was to do myself in.

1480
02:00:41,490 --> 02:00:42,889
了结
To snuff it.

1481
02:00:43,259 --> 02:00:46,592
从这个邪恶残酷的世界上彻底消失
To blast off forever, out of this wicked, cruel world.

1482
02:00:48,197 --> 02:00:50,597
也许有一时的痛苦
One moment of pain, perhaps

1483
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,663
然后就是永远的睡眠
and then sleep.

1484
02:00:52,902 --> 02:00:55,462
真的会
Forever and ever

1485
02:00:55,705 --> 02:00:57,002
直到永远
and ever.

1486
02:01:21,497 --> 02:01:23,226
我跳了 噢我的兄弟们
I jumped, O my brothers

1487
02:01:23,532 --> 02:01:24,931
摔得很重
and I fell hard.

1488
02:01:25,201 --> 02:01:27,499
但我没有了结
But I did not snuff it.

1489
02:01:28,104 --> 02:01:29,696
如果我了结了
If I had snuffed it

1490
02:01:29,939 --> 02:01:33,306
我就不会在这讲述我的故事了
I would not be here to tell what I have told.

1491
02:01:35,144 --> 02:01:39,808
我重新活了过来 经过了很长很长的黑暗
I came back to life after a long, black, black gap

1492
02:01:40,049 --> 02:01:43,348
好像有一百万年
of what might have been a million years.

1493
02:02:12,081 --> 02:02:14,641
他苏醒了 大夫
He's recovered consciousness, Doctor.

1494
02:02:25,863 --> 02:02:30,055
政府被控在犯罪改革中使用非人道手段

1495
02:02:30,067 --> 02:02:34,069
部长被指控非人道疗法

1496
02:02:34,069 --> 02:02:37,960
政府是凶手 医生被控 而阿历克斯康复

1497
02:02:38,075 --> 02:02:42,077
犯罪疗法男孩引起轩然大波 医生责备政府科学家"改变阿历克斯本性"

1498
02:02:42,077 --> 02:02:46,269
阿历克斯试图自杀 洗脑专家受到指责部长遭到谴责

1499
02:02:54,723 --> 02:02:56,213
你好 宝贝
Hello, lad.

1500
02:02:56,525 --> 02:02:58,015
你好 儿子
Hello, son.

1501
02:02:59,028 --> 02:03:00,427
你好吗?
How are you?

1502
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,621
好点了吗?
You feeling better?

1503
02:03:08,037 --> 02:03:09,129
哪阵风
What

1504
02:03:09,338 --> 02:03:10,396
把
gives

1505
02:03:11,841 --> 02:03:13,832
我的爹娘吹来了?
My father and mother blowing it?

1506
02:03:14,743 --> 02:03:16,335
你们
What makes

1507
02:03:17,113 --> 02:03:18,011
以为
you think

1508
02:03:18,314 --> 02:03:20,714
自己受欢迎吗?
you are welcome?

1509
02:03:23,652 --> 02:03:25,643
好了 不要伤心了
There, there, Mother. It's all right.

1510
02:03:25,855 --> 02:03:27,516
他不是有意的
He doesn't mean it.

1511
02:03:29,959 --> 02:03:32,450
你又上报了 儿子
You were in the papers again, son.

1512
02:03:33,262 --> 02:03:34,854
报上说
It said

1513
02:03:35,131 --> 02:03:37,827
他们冤枉你了
they had done great wrong to you.

1514
02:03:38,667 --> 02:03:40,032
他们还说了
It said

1515
02:03:40,336 --> 02:03:41,633
政府是如何地迫使你尝试
how the government

1516
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:43,862
直到真的
drove you to try

1517
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:45,664
自杀
and do yourself in.

1518
02:03:47,543 --> 02:03:49,773
当你再次想起 儿子
And when you think about it, son

1519
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,542
我们也有错
maybe it was our fault too

1520
02:03:53,883 --> 02:03:55,145
在某些方面
in a way.

1521
02:03:56,252 --> 02:03:58,152
该说的说了 该做也做了之后
Your home's your home

1522
02:03:58,487 --> 02:04:01,047
你的家还是你的家 儿子
when all's said and done, son.

1523
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,560
早上好　早上好 大夫
-Good morning. -Good morning, Doctor.

1524
02:04:22,511 --> 02:04:24,706
今天怎么样? 好点了
-How are you feeling today? -Fine, fine.

1525
02:04:25,014 --> 02:04:26,106
好 我可以吗?
Good. May I?

1526
02:04:26,515 --> 02:04:28,574
我是泰勒医生 以前没见过
-I'm Dr. Taylor. -Haven't seen you before.

1527
02:04:28,817 --> 02:04:30,114
我是你的心理医生
I'm your psychiatrist.

1528
02:04:30,419 --> 02:04:32,284
心理医生!我需要心理医生吗?
Psychiatrist! Do I need one?

1529
02:04:32,521 --> 02:04:34,011
只是医疗程序的一部分而已
Just part of hospital routine.

1530
02:04:34,223 --> 02:04:36,418
我们要谈性生活吗?
Are we going to talk about me sex life?

1531
02:04:38,093 --> 02:04:40,084
我给你看些幻灯片
I'm going to show you some slides

1532
02:04:40,329 --> 02:04:43,196
你要谈你的想法 好吗?
and you're going to tell me what you think about them.

1533
02:04:44,099 --> 02:04:45,031
很好
Jolly good.

1534
02:04:47,136 --> 02:04:48,694
你了解梦吗?
You know anything about dreams?

1535
02:04:49,138 --> 02:04:50,230
一点点
Something, yes.

1536
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:51,406
你知道它们什么意思吗? 可能吧
-You know what they mean? -Perhaps.

1537
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:53,908
你在想什么事吗?
You concerned about something?

1538
02:04:54,243 --> 02:04:57,235
不 没什么特别的
No, not concerned, really

1539
02:04:57,546 --> 02:04:59,537
只是近来经常做一个怪梦 
but I've been having this nasty dream.

1540
02:04:59,748 --> 02:05:01,238
很可怕
Very nasty.

1541
02:05:01,517 --> 02:05:03,417
好像自己被碾碎
It's like

1542
02:05:05,421 --> 02:05:07,548
当我粉碎了一切，你知道
when I was all smashed up, you know

1543
02:05:07,856 --> 02:05:09,915
而且好像半是清醒半是昏迷
and half-awake and unconscious-like

1544
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:12,252
近来总做这个梦
I kept having this dream.

1545
02:05:12,528 --> 02:05:15,429
所有这些医生都在玩我的脑袋
All these doctors were playing around with me gulliver.

1546
02:05:15,631 --> 02:05:17,724
你看 就像我脑子里面
You know, like the inside of me brain.

1547
02:05:17,967 --> 02:05:20,868
好像老是反复做这个梦
I seem to have this dream over and over again.

1548
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:23,231
你觉得它意味着什么吗?
Do you think it means anything?

1549
02:05:24,139 --> 02:05:28,576
像你这样爱重伤的病人通常会有这样的梦
Patients with injuries like yours often have dreams of this sort.

1550
02:05:28,777 --> 02:05:30,870
这只是康复过程的一部分
It's all part of the recovery process.

1551
02:05:32,147 --> 02:05:34,945
那么现在 你根据画面中人物
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply

1552
02:05:35,251 --> 02:05:37,242
来逐一描述这些幻灯
from one of the people in the picture.

1553
02:05:37,453 --> 02:05:40,650
你告诉我你觉得里面的人会说什么
You tell me what you think the person would say

1554
02:05:40,889 --> 02:05:41,787
好吗?
all right?

1555
02:05:42,057 --> 02:05:43,490
好
Righty-right.

1556
02:05:45,461 --> 02:05:47,793
"这羽毛多漂亮啊!"
" Isn't the plumage beautiful? "

1557
02:05:49,098 --> 02:05:51,566
我只是说另一个人会说什么吗?
I just say what the other person would say?

1558
02:05:55,704 --> 02:05:57,262
别想太久
Don't think about it too long.

1559
02:05:57,506 --> 02:05:59,997
说出你意识中首先闪现的东西
Say the first thing that pops into your mind.

1560
02:06:02,678 --> 02:06:05,078
卷心菜 灯笼裤
Cabbages. Knickers.

1561
02:06:06,215 --> 02:06:08,581
它没有嘴
It's not got a beak.

1562
02:06:08,784 --> 02:06:10,081
好
Good.

1563
02:06:13,722 --> 02:06:17,624
"你经常和他争吵的男孩病得很厉害"
"The boy you always quarreled with is seriously ill. "

1564
02:06:18,627 --> 02:06:20,322
我的意识一片空白
My mind is a blank

1565
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:25,332
我来替你打烂你的脸 孬种
and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos.

1566
02:06:25,601 --> 02:06:26,590
好
Good.

1567
02:06:29,204 --> 02:06:31,297
"你想干什么?"
"What do you want? "

1568
02:06:32,408 --> 02:06:35,741
我现在没时间 亲爱的 我只是来看表的
No time for the old in-out, love. I've just come to read the meter.

1569
02:06:36,145 --> 02:06:37,510
好
Good.

1570
02:06:41,016 --> 02:06:44,508
"你卖了我一块坏的表 我要退钱"
"You sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back. "

1571
02:06:44,953 --> 02:06:46,117
你知道你能拿那表干什么吗? 粘在你的屁股上
You know what you can do with that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1572
02:06:48,418 --> 02:06:49,418
好
Good.

1573
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:55,257
"你可以随便处置它们"
"You can do whatever you like with these. "

1574
02:06:56,865 --> 02:06:58,662
蛋
Eggiwegs.

1575
02:06:59,168 --> 02:07:01,136
我喜欢把它们
I would like

1576
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:02,667
打碎
to smash them.

1577
02:07:03,472 --> 02:07:04,769
然后把它们捡起来
And pick them all up

1578
02:07:04,973 --> 02:07:06,668
再扔
and throw--

1579
02:07:06,875 --> 02:07:08,342
妈的
Fucking hell!

1580
02:07:09,178 --> 02:07:11,544
好了 就这些
There. That's all there is to it.

1581
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:13,671
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1582
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:15,982
希望吧
Hope so.

1583
02:07:16,151 --> 02:07:19,177
完了吗? 是的 我很喜欢
-Is that the end, then? -Yes. -I was quite enjoying that.

1584
02:07:19,488 --> 02:07:20,785
那很好
Good. I'm glad.

1585
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:22,182
我做对了多少?
How many did I get right?

1586
02:07:22,491 --> 02:07:24,254
这不是那种测验
It's not that kind of a test.

1587
02:07:24,493 --> 02:07:27,792
但你的表现说明你会完全康复
But you seem well on the way to making a complete recovery.

1588
02:07:28,497 --> 02:07:29,862
那么我什么时候可以出去?
When do I get out, then?

1589
02:07:30,099 --> 02:07:32,761
我肯定不会太久了
I'm sure it won't be long now.

1590
02:07:34,103 --> 02:07:35,695
所以我等着
So I waited

1591
02:07:36,004 --> 02:07:37,471
噢 我的兄弟们
and, O my brothers

1592
02:07:37,906 --> 02:07:39,271
我一天天地康复
I got a lot better

1593
02:07:39,508 --> 02:07:42,773
大口吃着鸡蛋和大面包
munching away at eggiwegs and lomticks of toast

1594
02:07:43,011 --> 02:07:45,479
还有可爱的牛排
and lovely steakie-wakes.

1595
02:07:45,681 --> 02:07:47,171
然后有一天
And then one day

1596
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:51,512
他们说我会有一个非常特殊的客人
they said I was going to have a very special visitor.

1597
02:07:56,992 --> 02:07:59,688
在外面等一下 好吗 警官? 好的 先生
-Just wait outside for a moment, would you, Officer? -Yes, sir.

1598
02:08:02,798 --> 02:08:04,925
恐怕我变动日程影响了你
I'm afraid my change of schedule has thrown you.

1599
02:08:05,234 --> 02:08:07,429
病人好像正在吃晚饭
The patient's in the middle of supper.

1600
02:08:07,703 --> 02:08:10,536
没关系 部长 这没什么 
That's quite all right, Minister. No trouble at all.

1601
02:08:12,007 --> 02:08:14,999
晚上好 孩子  嗨 小兄弟们
-Good evening, my boy. -Hi there, my little droogies.

1602
02:08:15,244 --> 02:08:17,041
怎么样 年轻人?
How are you getting on, young man?

1603
02:08:17,413 --> 02:08:19,643
很好 先生 确实很好
Great, sir. Just great.

1604
02:08:20,416 --> 02:08:22,008
还有什么需要我做的吗?
Can I do anything more for you?

1605
02:08:22,217 --> 02:08:24,014
没有了 莱斯利先生 非常感谢!
I don't think so, Sir Leslie. Thank you very much.

1606
02:08:24,219 --> 02:08:26,847
那么我走了 护士!
Then I leave you to it. Nurse!

1607
02:08:29,725 --> 02:08:32,956
你好像一个人占了整个病房 孩子
You seem to have a whole ward to yourself, my boy.

1608
02:08:33,262 --> 02:08:34,456
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1609
02:08:35,063 --> 02:08:37,429
不过当我半夜疼醒的时候
And a very lonely place it is too, sir

1610
02:08:37,666 --> 02:08:40,032
这里也很孤独 先生
when I wake up in the mid of night with me pain.

1611
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:43,734
很高兴见你逐渐康复
Yes. Well, anyway, good to see you on the mend.

1612
02:08:43,972 --> 02:08:46,566
当然我一直和医院保持着联系
I kept in touch with the hospital, of course.

1613
02:08:46,875 --> 02:08:48,672
现在我亲自来看你
And now I've come down personally

1614
02:08:48,877 --> 02:08:50,469
来看看你过得怎样
to see how you're getting along.

1615
02:08:50,946 --> 02:08:53,244
我忍受了非人的折磨
I've suffered the tortures of the damned.

1616
02:08:53,449 --> 02:08:54,939
非人的折磨
Tortures of the damned.

1617
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:58,276
是的 我可以理解 你经历了非常
Yes, I can appreciate that you've had an extremely--

1618
02:08:58,487 --> 02:09:01,285
让我来帮你 可以吗?
Oh, look. Let me help you with that, shall I?

1619
02:09:01,656 --> 02:09:02,647
谢了 先生 谢谢
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

1620
02:09:03,492 --> 02:09:07,690
我诚恳地告诉你 作为政府一员的我、以及政府
I can tell you with all sincerity that I and the government of which I'm a member

1621
02:09:07,963 --> 02:09:11,899
对此深感歉意 孩子 深感歉意
are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry.

1622
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,397
我们尽力来帮助你
We tried to help you.

1623
02:09:13,602 --> 02:09:17,698
我们采纳了一些实际上不对的建议
We followed recommendations which were made to us that turned out to be wrong.

1624
02:09:18,106 --> 02:09:21,974
调查后会追究责任
An inquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs.

1625
02:09:22,611 --> 02:09:25,876
我们想让你把我们当作朋友
We want you to regard us as friends.

1626
02:09:26,114 --> 02:09:27,376
我们让你恢复正常
We put you right.

1627
02:09:27,783 --> 02:09:29,717
你正在接受最好的治疗
You're getting the best of treatment.

1628
02:09:29,918 --> 02:09:32,113
我们从没想让你受伤害
We never wished you harm.

1629
02:09:32,421 --> 02:09:35,117
但确实有些人这么想 并且一直这么想
But there are some who did, and do.

1630
02:09:35,624 --> 02:09:38,286
而我觉得你知道他们是谁
And I think you know who those are.

1631
02:09:38,894 --> 02:09:42,625
有一些人想利用你达到他们的政治目的
There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends.

1632
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:45,297
你要是死了他们就真高兴了
They would have been glad to have you dead

1633
02:09:45,501 --> 02:09:48,629
因为他们那样就可以以此指责政府了
for they thought they could then blame it all on the government.

1634
02:09:49,304 --> 02:09:51,636
还有某一个人
There is also a certain man

1635
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:54,331
一个颠覆文学作家
a writer of subversive literature

1636
02:09:54,643 --> 02:09:56,736
他一直为你的血而嚎叫
who has been howling for your blood.

1637
02:09:56,945 --> 02:10:00,346
他想捅你一刀都想疯了
He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you.

1638
02:10:00,816 --> 02:10:02,306
不过你现在远离他 很安全
But you're safe from him now.

1639
02:10:02,551 --> 02:10:04,610
我们把他安置好了
We put him away.

1640
02:10:06,522 --> 02:10:09,616
他发现你曾害过他
He found out that you had done wrong to him.

1641
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:12,558
至少他认为你害过他
At least he believed you had done wrong.

1642
02:10:12,861 --> 02:10:17,059
他在头脑里形成这样一个念头
He formed this idea in his head that you had been responsible

1643
02:10:17,366 --> 02:10:20,767
他一个亲近的人死了 你应该负责
