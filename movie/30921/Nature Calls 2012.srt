to have scouts now?

Mikey, we just need to chat, okay?

7
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,544
Now, usually, we'd talk to you
like men should talk to a little boy,

00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,465
but, today, we're gonna talk
like we're all men.

we talk about in here,

Agree?

Why would we cry?

Sometimes you don't see a thing
coming till it hits ya.

14
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,606
Then it goes in your ears,
it goes into your heart,

15
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,399
and you can feel it hurting
all the way down.

16

I mean, Mikey, you can feel it
hurting all the way down

It's like a punch
to your insides, man.

And you're not expecting this.

20

It's like a sucker punch.
Waah!

Mikey, you know, we all have people
that we can depend on.

my dad's been sick for a long time,

around forever.

I know this.

had time to think about this, but,

you know, our dads...

00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,440
Your dad loves you, man,
no matter what,

32

and no matter
where he might be.

Even if he goes away.

34

- Goes away forever.
- Forever?

35
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,325
Is he okay?

36
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,496
What? Wait.

Is he dead?

This is the sucker punch
that I was talking about.

Mikey...

I'm not gonna cry, Mr. Stevens.
