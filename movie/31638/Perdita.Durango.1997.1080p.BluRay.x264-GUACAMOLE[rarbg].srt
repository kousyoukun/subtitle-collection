1
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,673
Hands up! Hands up!

2
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,667
You're sisters?

3
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,755
That's my sister.

4
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,508
My little virgin,

5
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:37,378
My grandma is a Witch,

6
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,551
my father was a Spaniard,
and I have a Mexican ranch.

7
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,050
It's the truth.

8
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,130
Keep quiet! Fucking hell!
I don't want one fucking move!

9
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:13,468
Don't move!

10
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,208
Come on, show me your titties.

11
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:45,592
Oh, Good Lord!

12
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,172
Last week, we owed him 20 grand,
and now it's 23!

13
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,751
Anything to declare?
- Nothing, Officer.

14
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,922
All right. You may continue.
- Thank you.

15
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:18,797
I got this from a bull.
I was a bullfighter.

16
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:58,593
Fucking hell! Living with you
will be kickass!

17
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:52,502
We got the money you sent.
Danny says thanks, and so do I.

18
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,960
I'm reading the Bible, looking for
the place where you're fighting.

19
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:04,257
Have you seen the Garden of Eden?

20
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,629
Hey, man! I missed you, asshole!

21
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,755
As elegant as ever. How's business?

22
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:35,084
I get by...
- That's over, man, that's over!

23
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:39,047
We're too big for this fucking border.

24
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,630
I'm changing your luck, Romeo.
You know Marcelo Santos?

25
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:49,005
Crazy Eyes Santos?
- Don't ever call him that!

26
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,130
He hates it. It pisses him off.
- Are you working for him now?

27
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,967
Listen. You're my brother. My brother.

28
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,171
Mr. Santos wants to meet you.

29
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,588
He's here?
- In the car.

30
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,708
You crazy bitch!

31
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:33,129
Sorry, man. Who understands women?

32
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,506
She looks like Barbie.

33
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:36,041
It's my treasure.

34
00:48:56,417 --> 00:49:00,126
Light of my life,
fire of my heart.

35
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,844
You're the sorcerer.

36
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,382
We live on a river bank.

37
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,048
That of the great light.

38
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:44,797
On the other bank
is the great night

39
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:47,966
where we find force to live!

40
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:52,047
If we return from the other side,
we'll have power,

41
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:55,546
power over others,
over our enemies.

42
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:04,292
We must triumph over those
who would keep us

43
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,550
in poverty and sadness!

44
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:18,126
This is the truth.

45
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:21,174
We must devour our enemies

46
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:24,626
before they devour us.
This is the Pinaldo.

47
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:28,588
The saint's born from death.

48
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:30,299
Only night gives strength
against the light.

49
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:34,297
No sainthood without death.

50
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:09,964
Party's over, santero!

51
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,791
Bitch! Bitch!

52
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,044
What's wrong, santero?

53
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:06,086
Fucking gringo cocksuckers!

54
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,752
Go fuck a cactus!

55
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:15,757
Did you see what I just did?
It wouldn't have happened

56
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:19,175
if you'd been here. Think about it!

57
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:33,007
Some strange men came asking for you.

58
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,049
We said nothing.

59
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:48,334
They said you owed Catalina money,

60
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:53,588
but I know they were lying
because I raised you

61
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:57,759
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

62
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,085
I was not afraid, I have seen
so much, my grandson.

63
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:22,127
Even invisible things.
When you were born I knew

64
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:26,380
you were special that when you died,
you'd turn into a jaguar

65
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:29,584
and run along Caribbean beaches.

66
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,049
Faster! Faster!

67
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,336
Faster! Faster!

68
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:46,592
Fuck,yeah!

69
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:49,051
Here's 10, kick my ass!

70
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,752
Give it me, motherfucker!

71
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:04,133
Give it to me!
Give it to me, motherfucker!

72
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,548
Oh, fuck!

73
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:59,002
Catalina. About a debt.
- He's at the back.

74
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:41,800
No long faces.

75
01:43:54,875 --> 01:43:58,834
Holy shit! He wasted him!
Son of a bitch!

76
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,710
Turn it off.

77
01:47:10,375 --> 01:47:11,672
Don't you understand?

78
01:47:11,667 --> 01:47:14,796
Here. Cocksuckers!

79
01:47:14,792 --> 01:47:17,966
Who the fuck is that!

80
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,672
Fucking Romeo!

81
01:58:02,417 --> 01:58:06,376
Hey, cousin.
- Hey, man. You've brought our pal.

82
01:58:06,625 --> 01:58:10,584
Hi, Doug.
- You haven't changed.

83
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:16,630
Nothing's changed. Right, Reggie?
- Like always, us three.

84
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:27,631
Count it.

85
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:30,344
I trust you.

86
01:59:53,083 --> 01:59:54,756
Reggie,

87
01:59:56,667 --> 01:59:58,590
I love you, Reggie.

88
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:28,584
Look at me!

89
02:00:29,208 --> 02:00:32,758
Look at me!
