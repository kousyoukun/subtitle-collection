1
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,590
Want another? Sweetie!

2
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,916
Bring me another Bud. And for you?
-What would you like?

3
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,713
Coke.
.Diet?

4
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,911
You fuckin' kidding?

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,958
You live in Mexico?
-Not exactly.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,596
Hey, you heading out somewhere?.
-Nowhere now. What about yourself?.

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,474
Phoenix. 4 day software convention.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,318
I'm a software salesman.

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,876
By the way, my name is Manny Flynn.
Half Jewish, half lrish.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,635
What's yours?
-Perdita Durango.

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,639
Ah, that's a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman. Married?

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,870
Listen, Manny,

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,914
you want me to go to Phoenix with you?
You pay me way, you buy my meals.

14
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,153
I'll keep your dick
hard for 4 straight days.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,431
While you're at the convention,
I'll do a little business myself.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,473
Plenty of guys there, right?.
I show some tit, milk a little cow.

17
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,476
Quick and clean. 50 bucks a pop.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,513
I'll let you keep half of the profit.
How about it?.

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,712
I gotta go.

20
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,631
Asshole!

21
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,911
Hands up! Hands up!

22
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,715
You're sisters?

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,153
Well, I had a sister, too.
Her name was Juana.

24
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,473
She had two little girls
that looked just like you.

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,274
You wanna see my sister? Yeah?

26
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,312
Open it.

27
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,633
That's my sister.
Her husband shot and killed her.

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,432
And then he took his gun

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,948
pointed to one

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,391
and then the other little girl
and he shot them both in the head.

31
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,875
Bang! Bang!

32
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,832
Thank you.

33
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,672
I need a drink.

34
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,108
Please stay behind the line
until you are called forward.

35
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,835
All citizens entering the
United States with goods to declare

36
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,838
please move to the red corridor.

37
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,873
Remain in your vehicle until
interviewed by an Officer.

38
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,749
Forget it.
-My little virgin,

39
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,759
I think today is my lucky day.
.But not mine.

40
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,759
Lo siento, but I'm in a
bad mood today.

41
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,473
Come on, everybody needs somebody.
Even woman like you, Srta. Spitfire.

42
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,749
My name is Romeo Dolorosa.
My grandma is a witch,

43
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,793
my father was a Spaniard,
and I have a Mexican ranch.

44
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,114
Do you wanna come with me?.

45
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,794
Well, my name is Perdita Durango

46
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,799
and I don't know shit about my fucking
parents and I don't wanna know shit

47
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,833
about your fucking little ranch.

48
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,393
You remind me of someone.
-Yeah? Who, Doris Day?

49
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,633
Let me guess.
You're from Hollywood, right?

50
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,713
Probably think you can turn me
into a big star?

51
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,197
But by the way you're dressed,
you remind me more of a faggot

52
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,313
or an extra in a bad Black
Sabbath video.

53
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,429
I like it.

54
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,268
Well, the truth is, I'm a scientist.
.A scientist?

55
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,232
No, you're definitely a dentist.

56
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,915
I could tell from that stupid smile
on your face.

57
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,919
It's the truth. Science is everything.
Scientists need money,

58
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,715
Iike everyone else. They need funds
to continue their research.

59
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,793
So, that's why I'm here
on this side of the border.

60
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,879
I see. Well, you're looking to the
wrong person for a donation. So...

61
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,310
Don't worry.
We have plenty of donations.

62
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,392
Like 12.000 dollars I just received

63
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,874
this morning
from the Morgens lnterstate Bank.

64
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,913
Keep quiet! Fucking hell!
I don't want one fucking move!

65
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,033
Don't move! Don't fucking move!
-Shut up!

66
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,193
If you keep quiet, nothing's
gonna happen, alright?

67
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,913
The money! Quick! Here!

68
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,713
Take off your shirt.
Come on, take off your shirt!

69
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,835
What the fuck are you doing, man?!
You're crazy!

70
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,872
Come on, show me your titties.
Keep going...

71
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,913
The bra... Come on, the bra! The bra!
-What the fuck you doing, man?!

72
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,868
It's not the time!
-Oh, Good Lord!

73
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,592
Come here!
-Do you hear me? Let's go! Shit!

74
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,315
Sweet mother of God!
Move! Move! Move!

75
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,233
Come on, Romeo! Are you nuts, or what?
Run! Fuck you!

76
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,632
Santero psychopath!

77
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,199
Ok, thank you very much.
Here you go, the mask of El Santo.

78
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,835
It will bring you good luck.
Thank you very much.

79
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,873
You had to do it your way!
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

80
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,239
It's the last time I'm working
with you, cabron! Fucking clown!

81
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,799
Piece of shit, Santero. He had
to wear that fuckin' little mask,

82
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,435
you know, like El Santo.

83
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,359
Hey, man, how much did we get?.
-I don't know, man! I don't know.

84
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,359
Maybe 20.000, maybe more.
-I hope it's more. At least 25.

85
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,359
One grand for each and the rest for
the mother-fucking Catalina!

86
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,791
Forget about Catalina, cabron.
-It's scary, man! I'm scared shitless!

87
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,909
Last week, we owed him 20 grand,
and now it's 23!

88
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,312
If we don't pay him soon, he'll kill
us and make a belt with our nipples!

89
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,239
Y eso no es funny, no senor.
We shouldn't have borrowed

90
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,909
money from him, I told you,
I told... Romeo?.

91
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,550
Romeo!

92
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,311
Fuck!

93
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,593
Holy fucking shit!
I'll get you, man! I'll get you!

94
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,630
Your luck is running out today, uh?
-Trust science, Perdita.

95
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,639
I have different plans of my own.
I get out of here. I'll donate my body

96
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,229
to science when I'm dead.
.You don't have to.

97
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,313
I already took care of that. Look.
-Are you fucking crazy?

98
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,872
C'mon trust in my science, Perdita.

99
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,071
Do you want to cross the border
with me?

100
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,153
So what the fuck are you?
A grave-robber or a bank-robber?

101
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,593
I do it all, my love.
I got a really busy schedule today.

102
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,708
Your papers, please.
-Yes, sir.

103
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,714
Anything to declare?
-Nothing, Officer.

104
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,153
All right. You may continue.
-Thank you.

105
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,714
Trust in science, Perdita.
Trust in science.

106
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,913
I come from the island Petit Caribe,
3 Miles long, 1 Mile wide.

107
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,518
When I was a kid, there were only
2 cars. And one day, of course,

108
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,915
they crashed.

109
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,718
Sooner or later,
it was bound to happen.

110
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,754
It was impossible for it not
to happen. That's how the world turns.

111
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,313
That's how you and I met, Perdita.

112
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,709
You'll be my Yalocha...
.What?

113
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,310
My High Priestess.

114
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,871
You can help me with the ritual.
Last night I dreamt about it,

115
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,595
I dreamt I was licking your body.

116
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,790
Stop! Stop!

117
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,712
Did I do this?.

118
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,192
What the fuck are you talking about?!

119
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,233
I'm a sorcerer, Perdita.
Your Babalou.

120
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,513
It's rule of Ocha.
Santeria, my science.

121
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,913
Don't talk shit o me. You don't
believe in those things, do you?

122
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,792
I do believe in ist power.

123
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,914
You want to see it or are you scared?

124
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,194
I wish you wouldn't do that.
-Why not? It scares evil spirits away.

125
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,278
I don't believe in voodoo bullshit.
I doubt if those people did either.

126
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,199
It's not voodoo. It's Santeria.
It's not the same.

127
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,352
Little magical tricks.
Latin bullshit.

128
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,393
But it works. You saw it.
-Yeah, but for how long?

129
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,637
You know, people are not that stupid.
-Yeah,

130
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,797
do you have a better idea, smartass?

131
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,191
Yeah,

132
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,391
you know what?

133
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,709
We should kill someone.
.What?

134
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,233
Yeah, we should kill them
and then we should eat them.

135
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,673
Fuck! Like animals, mi amor?
-That's right.

136
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,799
It'll be ingrained
in their brains forever.

137
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,512
Let's do it tomorrow.
-Tomorrow is not good.

138
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,314
I have a date across the border.
.A date?

139
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,758
Son of a bitch.
-It's not what you think.

140
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,718
It's business.

141
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,230
Being a kid in Caribe, I spent every
day in the port with my cousin Reggie.

142
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,319
There were huge ships, everyone going
to different places.

143
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,598
Panama, Mexico, Hong Kong, Lisboa.
Places that we couldn't imagine.

144
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,593
From the moment, I knew I would go
far into the world, beyond Caribe.

145
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,072
Yeah? What went wrong?
-What do you mean?

146
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,079
This isn't exactly Paris, sweetheart.
-Fuck you!

147
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,593
Fuck! I lived in Paris for 2 years,
mademoiselle, and 4 years in Madrid.

148
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,396
You know Madrid? Look at this...
Mira, mira. Esto...

149
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,319
I got this from a bull.
I was a bullfighter.

150
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,591
And this is fuckin' souvenir
from Beirut. The Marines!

151
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,633
The greatest travel agency
in this fuckin' wide world.

152
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,318
What are you thinking in that
little head of yours?

153
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,591
I'm thinking,

154
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,633
that if we're gonna do a kidnapping,
we should get a gringo.

155
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,877
A guero?
-lt'll be impressive.

156
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,315
Adolfo, did you hear that?
-Killing gueros?

157
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,513
Fucking hell! Living with you
will be kickass!

158
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,198
(Song) Who can turn the world on
with her smile?

159
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,516
Coming! Coming! I'm coming!

160
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,912
Hello, Mrs. Satisfy.

161
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,509
Is Estelle here?
.Of course she is.

162
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,279
Come on in. Come on in. Estelle?

163
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,472
Estelle, honey, Duane's here.

164
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,235
Oh, please don't make him wait.
Now, come on down!

165
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,636
Hello, Mr. Satisfy.
.Hi.

166
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,230
I'll be down in a second.

167
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,394
Estelle! Don't you hear me?
Come down!

168
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,593
What is Duane gonna think
of us? Oh, she is the worst!

169
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,194
Duane,

170
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,233
in this world, you have to be
in control.

171
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,273
It's the only thing that
makes us different from the animals.

172
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,279
Absolutely, Mr. Satisfy.
-Ah, you can call me Herb.

173
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,438
You know, when we were dating,
Glory Ann always called me Herb

174
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,393
after Herb Alpert, the musician.
You know?

175
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,353
The Tijuana Brass, you heard of them,
right?

176
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,511
Well,

177
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,837
not really...
.What is that?

178
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,873
It's a free-form mobile, representing
the 4 basic food groups...

179
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,151
Here they come.
.Ta.ta.ta.ta!

180
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,953
Here she is!

181
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,476
You look beautiful.
-Ok, you two kids.

182
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,513
Go out now and have a good time.
-Estelle said you're heading to Susie?

183
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,313
Ah, that's where the young ones go
to have fun nowadays?

184
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,038
Yeah, well...
-Let's go, Duane, otherwise

185
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,073
we might never get out of here.
-Duane, remember what I told you.

186
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,870
(Together) Always be in control!

187
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,431
They haven't arrived yet.

188
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,870
No. Where is Perdita?
-Shopping.

189
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,879
My, God! Are you alright, Sir?.
I could've killed you!

190
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,708
Call an ambulance! Call for help!

191
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,997
Alright, alright, alright!

192
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,515
Please, stop touching me!
Stop touching me!

193
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,591
Shit!

194
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,712
Excuse me, Sir...

195
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,710
It's the Holy Bible.

196
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,913
You also have a letter.
Is it a secret admirer?

197
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,799
Oh, my God! Is my number one fan.
Is my grandmother Maria Jose, man!

198
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,313
I love her! I love that woman.
She always writes o me, man.

199
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,515
The oldest woman in Petit Caribe.
I mean, no one knows how old she is.

200
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,553
Whatever happened in my country,
she was there to tell the story.

201
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,593
She can't write, so she dictates her
letters to my cousin Danny Mestiza.

202
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,313
Even when my cousin Reggie and I were
in Beirut, she sent me a letter.

203
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,399
We got the money you sent.
Danny says thanks, and so do l.

204
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,593
I'm reading the Bible, looking for
the place where you're fighting.

205
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,712
Have you seen the Garden of Eden?.

206
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,718
Did you see it?
-What, man?

207
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,792
The Garden of Eden.

208
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,873
Of course! Fuck, Adolfo, of course,
man! That's when I saw the Devil.

209
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,633
Garlic sprouted everywhere
he stepped.

210
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,752
There they are. Stay put.

211
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,871
Wait.

212
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,312
Primo!
-Reggie, man!

213
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,757
Hey, man! I missed you, asshole!

214
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,710
As elegant as ever. How's business?

215
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,914
I get by...
-That's over, man, that's over!

216
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,709
We're too big for this fucking border.

217
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,073
I'm changing your luck, Romeo.
You know Marcelo Santos?

218
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,153
Crazy Eyes Santos?
.Don't ever call him that!

219
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,233
He hates it. It pisses him off.
-Are you working for him now?

220
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,233
I told you, man, big business.
Big business!

221
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,711
Listen. You're my brother. My brother.

222
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,710
Mr. Santos wants to meet you.

223
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,873
He's here?.
.In the car.

224
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,597
Mr. Dolorosa.
You like the jabugo ham?

225
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,275
It's illegal but delicious.
-Thanks. It's a pleasure

226
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,279
meeting you, Mr. Santos.
-I know it's a strange place to meet,

227
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,313
but I'm on my way to another business
meeting, and I hate to fly. Drink?

228
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,351
Yeah, thanks.

229
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,392
Your cousin Reggie,
he speaks very highly ofyou.

230
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,433
He tells me you send money back home
to your family. I like that.

231
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,116
Well, Reggie and I are very tight,

232
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,869
but he might have exaggerated
a little, Mr. Santos.

233
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,311
You don't have to be humble with me.
I need someone like you by my side.

234
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,033
Here's my proposal. It's very simple.
In 48 hours, a truck will arrive.

235
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,913
A refrigerated, semi-trailer truck
loaded with human embryos

236
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,512
for the cosmetic industries.

237
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,959
You make a skin cream with fetuses?
-Not a bad idea, although it's not

238
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,073
originally mine. You see, the Nazis
made bars of soap out of the Jews.

239
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,670
Yeah, and you adapted it to our times?
-More or less. People want to be

240
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,679
so beautiful nowadays, hu? You have
to give them that they want.

241
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,838
Sure, everyone wants to look younger.
-Anyway, we must get this shipment to

242
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,873
a secret lab in Las Vegas right away.
-Right. You want me to go with Reggie?

243
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,992
No, I have other plans for him.

244
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,033
They tell me that you know the area.
Can you do it?

245
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,831
Certainly, Mr. Santos.
I'm glad to help.

246
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,714
Muy bueno. Now I have 10.000 dollars
for you in old bills.

247
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,914
The driver will have an envelope
with your instructions.

248
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,039
When you arrive safely in Las Vegas,
your cousin Reggie will give you

249
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,108
another 10.000 dollars. You remember
always, that God and I are with you.

250
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,312
Hey, chica! Looking for someone?
-Where the hell did you get that?

251
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,917
I took it from a kid. Get in.
Get in!

252
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,513
Ow! You are a clown, you know that?
-A clown with a golden dick.

253
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,670
Right.

254
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,875
Look, preciosa, look.

255
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,113
Yes! You little devil, you!
So your date was with a bank?

256
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,153
No, something better. We have to go
on vacation, isn't that great?

257
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,433
And when we get there, there'll be
another package like this. Give me!

258
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,359
Sounds like a good plan.
-Yes. We'll leave tomorrow night.

259
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,837
We've enough time for our little show.
Adolfo is getting ready everything.

260
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,159
I thought with everything that's
going on, I thought you would probably

261
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,034
forget about that Santero.
-Forget about it? Are you crazy?

262
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,113
It's the only thing I can think about.
Now more than ever. We need a good

263
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,073
sacrifice to appease the gods.
-Well, this is the perfect place.

264
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,153
There's nothing but little fuckin'
lambs walking around here.

265
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,914
We just have to think about doing it.
-It's easy. Just stop someone and say:

266
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,993
I'm Palo Mayombe High Priestess.
Mind if I cut your throat and eat

267
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,113
your heart? Ok, what should we get?

268
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,230
I don't know.

269
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,279
How about something blond, tanned,

270
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,311
muscular?.

271
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,797
Are you gonna fuck him or eat him?

272
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,797
Maybe both.
.Ok.

273
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,112
Here's your man.
-He's no good.

274
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,994
What do you mean he's no good?
-From far away he looked different.

275
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,999
Esta fuckin' borracho! I hate drunks.
.What do I do with him now?

276
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,113
I don't know. Why don't you lave him
where you found him?

277
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,192
Who the hell are you people?

278
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,312
You crazy bitch!

279
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,637
Sorry, man. Who understands women?

280
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,913
What are you doing?
-Watch, wait and see.

281
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,153
Shut up! Shut up!
Fucking blow your heads off!

282
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,632
Come on! Come on!

283
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,393
They're gonna kill the kids! They're
the devils! I saw it in their eyes!

284
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,433
They're gonna eat them and come
back for more. Fuck all of you!

285
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,633
Excuse me, excuse me!
-Shut up! What're you trying to do?

286
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,712
Shh, it's ok, shh...

287
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,512
What's going on?

288
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,276
Well, if you're figuring on ransoming,
you know,

289
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,279
Estelle's father works in an office.
-Shut up! Do you wanna get us killed?!

290
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,313
And my father doesn't have any money.
-The world doesn't spin only on money,

291
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,318
pinche guero.

292
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,433
Estelle?. Is that your name, princess?.
I like it. Estrellita,

293
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,473
that's what we'll call you.
Estrellita. You like that, Perdita?

294
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,359
What are you going to do to us?
-Nothing you won't like.

295
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,359
Show you where the people live.
Be a place to tell about, ifyou get

296
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,676
a chance on the next family picnic.
-Too bad you won't live to tell it.

297
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,633
Please let us go!
.She looks like Barbie.

298
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,793
You would stick your dick in a fucking
keyhole ifyou had the opportunity!

299
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,637
Listen, I understand that your people

300
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,909
have been, you know, oppressed by our
country. Ok?

301
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,119
And I feel for you,
you know? I mean, I really do.

302
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,153
But it's not our fault.
It's not our fault! Ok?.

303
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,632
Well, why?

304
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,919
Are you going to kill us?
-Oh, my God!

305
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,630
No, we're not going to kill you.
-Ok, ok.

306
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,719
It's gonna be worse. What do you
think about Christmas in fucking hell?

307
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,230
Oh, my God!
-Holiday in hell! Holiday!

308
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,313
A fucking happy holiday!
You make it right, sugar!

309
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,512
You're the best. I love you.

310
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,793
Come on! Come on! Don't look at me
like that! Come on, cheer up! Fun!

311
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,873
Get party, ok? I'm gonna put a song
on I know you're gonna like.

312
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,992
Come on, listen to this.

313
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,952
It's Herb Alpert!
-And the Tijuana Brass!

314
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,953
This can't be happening!
-It's a sign! It's a sign, Perdita!

315
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,073
No hay duda, they are the chosen ones!
-Listen, please. Please, please...

316
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,552
Please! Help us!
-Hey! See you around, pendejo!

317
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,238
Sheriff?
-What now, Fed?

318
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,313
Somebody wants to talk to you.
.Does it have to be now?

319
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,559
Says he's from the DEA.
-I'll be damned! A big-shot.

320
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,552
Ok, gimme 2 minutes.
.Ok.

321
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,719
And shut the door behind you
on your way out, will you?

322
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,750
I'm sorry, Vicky.
We'll have to continue this later.

323
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,909
See you tomorrow?
-Yeah, I'll call you.

324
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,309
This way, sir.
-Thank you.

325
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,713
How ya doing? Woody Dumas, Special
Agent for the Federal Narcotics

326
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,752
Division up there in Dallas.
-Rip Ford. Sit down.

327
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,509
Tell me how I can help you.
What happend to you?

328
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,558
Nothing. Sure is hot in here.

329
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,552
That's Susie.
-Thank you.

330
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,030
So, are you up to speed
on this operation?

331
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,078
What operation?

332
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,079
I sent you a fax two days ago.
-Oh, yeah, the fax from Dallas.

333
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,079
Yeah, I have it here. You're after
that character, what's his name?

334
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,073
Romeo Dolorosa.
-Yeah, he's supposed to be

335
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,113
a witch doctor, or something.
-Santero, drug dealer,

336
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,914
bank robber, scumbag!
.Here it is.

337
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,313
I'll reckon he made it through
your ambush in Del Rio.

338
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,313
They say he disappeared like a ghost.
-Well, he was lucky.

339
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,153
Could have been magic, right?
Maybe this Romeo has a cloth doll

340
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,909
Iooks just like you,
stuck full of needles.

341
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,478
It says here his hide-out's
in Mexico.

342
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,518
Yeah, he's got a ranch on the border.

343
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,718
I don't see how we can help you.
It's outside of our jurisdiction

344
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,719
and it's out of your jurisdiction
too, Special Agent Dumas.

345
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,759
Yeah, I know it's outside ofyour
jurisdiction and I know you're busy,

346
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,793
but I followed this guy for quite a
while and I know he works both sides

347
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,719
of the border wherever the money is.
-It's a big border.

348
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,511
Yeah, it is. But unfortunately for
you, they're here in Susie 'cause

349
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,553
I just saw her a few hours ago.
-Her? There's a woman involved, too?

350
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,593
Perdita Durango. She's as dangerous
as he is, maybe more.

351
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,439
This woman that you say you saw
has she done anything illegal

352
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,439
in the State of Texas?
-It's not gonna take her long

353
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,439
to break the law.
-Sheriff Ford speaking. Yeah.

354
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,153
2 college kids you say? You're sure?
Ok. Yeah, we're coming right away.

355
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,233
Yeah, thanks for calling, Phil.
-You know, Ava Gardner.

356
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,909
I always loved her lips.

357
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,239
Welcome to Negrita lnfante!

358
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,913
What's the plan, Romeo?
-Forget about the plan, Adolfo.

359
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,153
The future has already been written.
.Cool.

360
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,193
You're the boss!
-No, you're the boss!

361
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,392
You're the boss!
-I say you are the boss!

362
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,715
Your're...

363
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,712
What's wrong with him?

364
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,719
This is crazy! Oh, my God!
Where are we!

365
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,715
Looks like another planet.

366
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,912
This cannot be happening to me!

367
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,993
Sleep a little, senorita.
-Please let me go!

368
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,999
Don't you know they'll kill us?
-I know nothing, senorita.

369
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,073
What? You're with them! Look,
I have 40 dollars and a VlSA card.

370
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,713
Ifyou let me go,
I'll give you my number.

371
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,990
Ok. I'll give it to you now.
It's 7.4.7.0.

372
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,592
You want a blanket?
-Say something!

373
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,752
You want a blanket?
-Why are you doing this to me?

374
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,793
You wanna kill us, too? Is that it?

375
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,031
Fuck!

376
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,394
I want to share something with you,
Duane.

377
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,797
It's my treasure.

378
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,790
A sticker collection?
It looks interesting.

379
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,309
Interesting?!

380
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,037
Duane,
when I first saw these drawings,

381
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,039
I started looking for answers
to the big questions in life!

382
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,709
What the fuck are we doing here,
Duane?

383
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,038
Why do we need to eat?

384
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,079
Why do we need to fuck
or watch TV? Tell me.

385
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,079
Do you understand what I'm saying?.

386
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,313
Y're not one of those kids who doesn't
believe in anything? Are you, Duane?

387
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,076
No,

388
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,317
I believe in a superior energy.

389
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,711
Energy?! Energy?! Fuck energy, Duane!

390
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,913
No, no, no! Don't start with
that hippie bullshit, ok?

391
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,919
I'm talking about Gods!
Gods creators of fucking universes!

392
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,716
Ok. Ok, all right. I believe, ok?
.Good.

393
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,791
God!

394
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,915
So Goldilocks wants to be a hero?
-Shut up!

395
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,873
I expected you to be a stupid-ass
white girl that depends on daddy.

396
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,913
I bet your biggest hope is to marry
some cocksucking cowboy, pump out

397
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,953
2 blond kids perpetuating the cycle
endlessly. Isn't that right?

398
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,959
Give me the gun.
-I don't know what this is about,

399
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,913
but I do not wanna die!
-Ok, then kill me.

400
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,516
Go ahead, shoot!

401
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,513
But if you miss...
-I know how to shoot a gun!

402
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,474
Really?
I'll give you piece of advice.

403
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,559
I don't need your advice.
-lfyou really wanna do something,

404
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,559
do it without thinking about. That's
the difference between you and me.

405
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,838
I would have killed you long time ago.
-For instance the Aztecs,

406
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,874
the old inhabitants of this land.
This people had this all figured out

407
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,879
thousands ofyears before
you and I were born, Duane.

408
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,151
See this guy? It's me.

409
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,312
And this here is you.

410
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,158
Food for the Gods.

411
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,915
How many men have you fucked?.
None?.

412
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,317
I can't believe it.
You're still a virgin?

413
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,713
It's written all over your face.
It's ok. We've all been there.

414
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,913
Come on, this is stupid.
Gimme the gun.

415
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,794
That's good.

416
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,713
You know what they did to me at
school when I misbehaved?

417
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,309
They would whack my hands
with a ruler.

418
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,317
Kiss my feet! Come on!

419
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,671
Good girl.

420
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,633
You have to die to live.
-Oh, my God.

421
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,911
Exactly.

422
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,711
Think of Jesus Christ.

423
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,553
Why are millions of people coming
together each Sunday

424
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,717
and drink his blood?

425
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,550
Tell me...

426
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,913
didn't you know that one has to
sacrify to the Gods?

427
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,710
People forgot their religion.

428
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,152
I envy you, really.

429
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,478
Through your sacrifice
you'll be immortal

430
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,511
Iike Jesus.

431
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,597
Telling him a bedtime story, Romeo?

432
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,639
Well, just filling in a few holes
in Duane's education.

433
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,713
Well, my little intellectuals,
I have one or two holes

434
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,955
that I need filling, myself.

435
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,632
This way. Sit down.

436
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,310
Sit down!

437
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,999
Here, what are you doing?
What do you want?! Leave me alone!

438
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,919
Does it hurt, Estrellita?.
Hm, Estrellita.

439
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,915
Light of my life,
fire of my heart.

440
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,708
I'm not going to do
anything...

441
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,513
I hate her!
-I think your friend Duane likes her.

442
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,639
Is he with her?.
-I'm afraid so. But don't worry,

443
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,673
you're with me.
Romeo will take care of you, mi amor.

444
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,879
Put your hands up. Up! Up! Up!

445
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,309
Oh no!

446
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,076
Carajo! What the fuck is this?!
.What?

447
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,112
It's fake.
-Come on, Estrellita,

448
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,153
you don't need it. Leave it.
That's for the putas, Estrellita!

449
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,871
Carajo!

450
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,151
No!

451
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,551
What are your goals in life, Duane?

452
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,636
What?

453
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,399
What are your plans for the future?
Come on, Duane, goals.

454
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,877
All good American boys have them.
How often have you done this, Duane?

455
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,996
Huh?.

456
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,793
Looks like you start to like me.

457
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,392
I already worried about.

458
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,313
Tell me sweets.
At least, I'm a woman.

459
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,152
Oh, my God.

460
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,992
How many times?.

461
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,511
10?

462
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,631
5?

463
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,912
Fuck! Once?.

464
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,311
Shit.

465
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,392
So, how was it?
-I'll never forget.

466
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,949
I'll make sure you don't forget,
'cause it'll be the only fuck

467
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,993
you'll have in your life.
Time's up, cowboy.

468
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,872
Ow!

469
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,913
There's no TV here,
but there's something better

470
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,714
I want to show you.
Come on. Get up!

471
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,313
The two greatest pleasures in life
are fucking and killing.

472
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,676
So...

473
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,713
I think it should be you who decides
who is going to be sacrificed.

474
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,673
You're the sorcerer.
-What about the gringo?

475
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,872
You chose him.
.Bullshit!

476
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,870
You're the one who started this!

477
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,913
You know all you wanted was that
little fucking blonde pussy, anyway.

478
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,710
The poor girl bled a lot, you know.

479
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,792
Just like caramel cream.

480
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,479
Well, too bad she's not
a virgin anymore, huh?

481
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,513
Wouldn't it have been
better for your little ceremony?

482
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,717
Yeah that's true.

483
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,799
Why didn't I think
about it before? Shit!

484
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,996
Too late now. Anyway, I'm glad we'll
take a trip after the ceremony

485
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,033
because they'll be talking about it
for a long, long time.

486
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,313
Everything is falling into place.
I'm a lucky man, bonita.

487
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,276
Fuck!

488
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,711
Ifyou call me bonita one more
fucking time, I'll fucking kill you!

489
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,633
Ok, it's time. The show must begin.
Before anything, I want you to know

490
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,639
that it's been a great pleasure
knowing you both.

491
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,673
You see, Duane, they'll kill us!
-This can't be happening.

492
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,713
I mean, this can't be happening!
-I'm afraid it is, Duane, cabron.

493
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,953
I mean, out there there's a bunch
of people that have come very far

494
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,994
for this and we cannot
let them down. So...

495
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,678
one of you will die.
-One? Only one?!

496
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,753
Yeah, that's right. Only one. I mean,
Perdita and I haven't decided who.

497
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,393
Best if we decide all together.
-What happens to the other one?

498
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,913
The other one gets a trip to Miami.
What's this here? A fucking contest?!

499
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,913
Ok. Ok. Who votes for Duane?
-I'm sorry, Duane.

500
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,919
Estelle, what the fuck are you doing?
.I don't wanna die.

501
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,919
But what about me?
-Relax, cabron. Now you vote.

502
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,919
Let's see, whoever thinks, Estelle
should be the one, raise their hand.

503
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,913
You son of a bitch!
-You're the only bitch around here.

504
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,919
I saw you fucking him!
-He raped me!

505
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,919
That's bullshit!
I saw you moving your ass.

506
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,073
After 2 years of playing square,
I've the same right to live as you do!

507
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,113
When my father finds out what you've
done he'll chop your balls off!

508
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,914
Your father's a fucking joke!
-Shut up!

509
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,874
Ok. Perdita, what do we do now?
.I don't know.

510
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,913
After this fucking circus,
I think they both should die.

511
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,909
Excuse me,
the people are getting restless.

512
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,317
Ok, Adolfo, you decide. Which one?
-The gringa.

513
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,879
Who do you think you are?
Romeo, you're not listening to him?

514
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,312
I'm sorry, it's been decided.

515
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,313
Don't be scared, Estrellita.
Don't be scared.

516
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,633
Tonight, you'll be immortal.
You'll enter in the house of dreams

517
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,673
where you'll live forever.
Stop crying, Estrellita!

518
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,199
No!

519
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,913
I was 10 years old
when they gave me the necklaces.

520
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,993
One for each god. Elegua, Gemaya,
Chango, Obatala and Ochun.

521
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,633
Since then, my necklaces have
protected me from evil.

522
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,312
Ache, ache, ache...

523
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,632
We live on a river bank.

524
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,117
That of the great light.

525
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,675
On the other bank
is the great night

526
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,792
where we find force to live!

527
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,675
If we return from the other side,
we'll have power,

528
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,076
power over others,
over our enemies.

529
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,199
Somebody help me! Somebody stop him!

530
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,514
We must triumph over those
who would keep us

531
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,550
in poverty and sadness!

532
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,790
This is the truth.

533
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,639
We must devour our enemies

534
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,990
before they devour us.
This is the Pinaldo.

535
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,789
The saint's born from death.

536
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,392
Don't you want to see Romeo eating
your girlfriend's heart out?

537
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,871
Just might turn you on.

538
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,479
You're a monster!
How can you do this?!

539
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,870
Don't blame me, guerito!

540
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,913
Don't you remember?
You voted for her, too. Huh?

541
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,715
Enjoy the show, sweetheart.

542
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,712
You little piece of shit!

543
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,709
Do you feel the fucking pain?.

544
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,671
Go!

545
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,673
See if you fucking like it!

546
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,796
Watch!

547
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,992
Only night gives strength
against the light.

548
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,919
No sainthood without death.
-Stop it! No!

549
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,470
Romeo!

550
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,713
You remember me, honey?
Remember the money we owe Catalina?

551
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,512
Well, forget it. Now it's too late.

552
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,712
I bring him your fucking head!
Party's over, santero!

553
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,272
Bitch! Bitch!

554
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,192
Get off me! He's alive!

555
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,277
Where's the other kid?

556
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,471
Duane!

557
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,633
Get in the car! Get in!
Come on! Come on! Shit!

558
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,113
Are we gonna stay up here looking?
Plenty of them could've died!

559
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,159
They're a bunch of fucking killers!
-Hey! Forget about it, Fed!

560
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,153
Remember, we're not here.
-He's right. We can't do anything.

561
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,710
Who's this, a relative or something?
-My sister's boy.

562
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,872
Lucky you.

563
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,912
Go! Go! Go!

564
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,798
Fuck! No one says anything, or what?
-What the fuck do you want us to say?

565
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,879
Don't you wanna know who that was?
-What for? He's fucking dead!

566
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,959
All I want to know is what the fuck
are we gonna do with these two?

567
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,118
Give me time, Perdita, ok?
I'm trying to think of something, ok?

568
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,233
Stop it, please stop it! Stop it!
-Shut up! Shut up!

569
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,870
Stop it! Enough! Stop it!
-Shut up! Shut up!

570
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,230
It's ok. It's ok.

571
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,473
The meeting point is in Junction.
There, we will pick up the truck.

572
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,072
If we drive all night,
we could get there on time.

573
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,710
We can't be late, Perdita.

574
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,799
What's wrong, santero?
Did your gods abandon you?

575
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,279
You see? We lost 'em!
-Relax, he's right in front of us.

576
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,915
Just can't see him.
If I go any faster,

577
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,075
he's gonna see us.
-You sure? He could've disappeared.

578
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,709
They say Dolorosa' a nagual.

579
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,710
A nagual?
-A supernatural beast

580
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,919
that has a human head
and a jaguar's body.

581
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,953
Yeah, and a camel's dick!
-Best of all, he can make himself

582
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,993
invisible in front of his enemies.
-Well, that would explain many things.

583
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:22,033
Like how he get across the border?
-Yeah, with two naked and feathered

584
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,993
kids in his back seat.
-You must be kidding.

585
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,679
You believe that Mexican bullshit?
-The stuff works ifyou believe in it.

586
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,269
You know, one time I saw these guys
crash right into a brick wall 'cause

587
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,313
they thought they could go through.
-And did they?

588
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,399
Little pieces went through. The rest
stayed splattered all over the wall.

589
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,713
Should it be parked in the middle
of the road with those two inside?

590
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,313
Gonna wait.
You don't fuck around with Santos.

591
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,992
I promised Reggie I wouldn't.

592
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,152
True, you made a promise.

593
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,159
And a Spanish gentleman never
breaks his promise, right?

594
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,710
Even if it will cost him his life?.

595
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,715
What do you want? That's how I am.

596
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:21,153
And you? What if I were killed?
Would you cry?

597
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,152
Hey, Skinny? Skinny boy? Hey, what's
are you doing, popsicle dick?

598
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,353
Come on, talk to me! Skinny boy?
What's going on? Come on! Come on!

599
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:44,153
I think he has to pee.
-No, man, he wants to suck your dick!

600
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,355
Are you a bit nervous, Pete?
.Nervous? What the fuck would I have

601
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,393
to be nervous about, cabron?
-Shit, partner! Look at the truck!

602
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,152
You took 6 amphetamines, cafedrine,

603
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,318
Korean, American and Siberian
Ginseng, 16 Giant E-zees!

604
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,952
Vitamins to keep me young.

605
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,709
Yoo-hoo! What is it now, Mr. Fetus?

606
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,878
There it is!

607
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,480
Right on time.

608
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,797
Santos knows how to do things right.

609
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,876
Hey, Dolorosa!

610
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,390
Cool.
Dede Paralta, Pete Amendariz.

611
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,870
Fuck's up?
-Right smack on time!

612
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,870
Mr. Santos will appreciate that.

613
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,391
Your instructions. In Las Vegas,
Reggie San Pedro is waiting for you.

614
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,913
I know, I know. He's my cousin.
.That doesn't concern me.

615
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,397
Mr. Santos'll be counting on you and l
hope you don't fucking let him down!

616
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,797
Look at you, Skinny, you're frozen!

617
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,712
Piece of shit! Ass.munch!
Fucking gringo cocksuckers!

618
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,716
Shut up!
.Go fuck a cactus!

619
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,710
Estelle...

620
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,309
I think it's the police.
Shh... shh.

621
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,712
All right, we got 'em. And those
other 3 assholes work for Santos.

622
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,718
We can't go in like this Dumas.
We gotta call in some back-up.

623
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,552
Get off me! Go back to your
fucking crossword puzzle!

624
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,399
Come on!

625
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,998
Who's that?
-My woman.

626
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,039
The two in the back? Nephews?
What's this? Fucking family picnic?

627
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,993
Shit! I hate working
with goddamned morons!

628
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,396
Fuck!
-Alright, assholes! D.E.A.!

629
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,079
Drop your guns! Put your hands up!
-Fuck you!

630
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,073
Son of a bitch!
-Dede, cover me!

631
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,074
Shit! Goddamned devil!
Just go ahead and kill me!

632
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,510
Skinny!

633
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,511
Skinny!

634
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,110
Now, you dumbfuck!

635
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,710
Shit!

636
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,794
Fuck you!

637
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,799
Motherfucker!
-Stop the fucking truck!

638
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,316
Stop the fucking truck!

639
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,709
Your luck has run out, asshole!

640
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,390
Charly, take care of this baby.

641
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,711
Yeah. Thank you very much!

642
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,872
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Get off me!

643
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,390
No, sir, please don't move. Lay down.

644
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,711
Lay down, sir!

645
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,390
Yeah,

646
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,709
the bambinos. Great, great! Yes.

647
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,519
What do we do now?
-They're all dead. Marcello, Peralta,

648
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,519
Armendariz and fucking Skinny!
-They were all good men.

649
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:01,872
They didn't deserve to die that way.
-Who would have thought that Dolorosa

650
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,913
was going to mess everything up?
-He came highly recommended.

651
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,953
Seems like D.E.A. was following
him for a while.

652
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:15,275
We must act quick to protect the
merchandise. I have to find that man,

653
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,313
what's his name?
-Woody Dumas from Dallas. I know him.

654
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,393
He's hurting us so bad.
-Everyone wants to get rid of him.

655
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,314
Even his bosses in Dallas.
-Who can we get?

656
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,513
It would be wiser to send an outside
representative to handle the job.

657
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,393
Why not send The Fist?
-Yes, Provino Momo The Fist.

658
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,393
I know him well. I'll give him
24 hours to deliver.

659
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:48,508
And tomorrow, we have one less worry.
-Man, my blessing goes with The Fist,

660
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,711
and may God be with him.

661
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,318
Girls! Hey!
.What do we do with Romeo Dolorosa?

662
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,872
He's as dangerous as Dumas.

663
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,718
Stop that thief! Call the police!

664
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,717
Hi, pendejos. I hope you like it.

665
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,713
The idea of driving 1.000 Miles
with Estrellita makes me ill.

666
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,152
What if I take Duane?
-He can take the car away from you.

667
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,718
No. He'll come with me in the truck.
-What if I tie him up?

668
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,315
Bad idea. If anyone sees him,
we'll be fucked.

669
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,877
So you'll do better with Estrellita.

670
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,356
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I only tried it twice, you know,

671
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,393
once, in summer before starting Junior
High, I had one of my father's Larks.

672
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,712
I only smoked half and I couldn't do
anymore because I started coughing.

673
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,872
The second one was at a party
at my sorority, you know,

674
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,993
one of the student clubs that they
have. Mine was Kappa Gama Epsilon.

675
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,715
This time it was a lot better,
it was sweeter.

676
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,672
Look, I know, I know,

677
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,713
I'm just talking, and you hat me.
You do hate me, right?

678
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,799
I'm sorry. I'm so nervous,
I don't know what to do.

679
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,913
I can't help it. Please,
are you ever going to talk to me?

680
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,432
Listen, you little cunt. If you don't
stop breathing down my fucking neck

681
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,473
you won't make it
to he next gas station.

682
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,191
Ok?

683
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,913
My Dad used to sing this song to me
when I was a little boy.

684
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,439
Are your parents dead?
-They're on vacation in Europe.

685
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,308
They won a trip on one of those
TV shows for couples.

686
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,393
Was it one of those shows where Mom
tells millions of people

687
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,319
how she does it with Dad?.
-They did 8 shows!

688
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,313
I mean, it was the worst 2 months
of my entire life!

689
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,712
Well, and now this.

690
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,556
It's not so bad. You're still alive.

691
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,994
Why are memories always so sad?
-Not always. Come on, I remember once,

692
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,913
when I was a kid someone brought
movies to Petit Caribe.

693
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,716
They showed them in my uncle's barn.

694
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,473
There I saw Burt Lancaster for the
first time in the movie "Veracruz".

695
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,872
Saint Burt Lancaster, man!

696
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,390
He had about 108 giant gleaming teeth.

697
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:50,273
Such a man I wanted to be combined
with the nobility of Gary Cooper.

698
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,753
It's a dramatic ending.
It's the perfect ending for a man.

699
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,311
The true path to Sainthood.

700
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,315
Yeah!

701
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,033
You're going to kill us when we get
to Las Vegas, aren't you?

702
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,073
Don't make plans. I hate people
who make plans, Duane.

703
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,039
Be best if we work things out
as we go along, amigo,

704
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,039
don't you think?
-I would appreciate that.

705
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,394
I think we should stay on touch, sir.

706
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,311
Sir?

707
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,794
What's this?

708
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,913
Junction to...

709
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,912
Las Vegas.

710
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,712
Come on! Come on!

711
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,398
Yeah, Doyle! What did you look at
the map with? Your fucking asshole?!

712
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,472
They're going to Vegas. Las Vegas!

713
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,795
Hello?. Hello?.

714
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,390
Piece of shit phone!

715
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,993
What's that strange sound?
Speak more slowly, sir.

716
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,072
He's out of range.

717
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,671
Fuck you!

718
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,193
This is your Captain Romeo Dolorosa
speaking. Welcome aboard.

719
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:36,233
Please fasten your seatbelts
and try to sleep.

720
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,551
Thank you very much. Fuck you!

721
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,679
Ok, guys. I hope to help out
with your little romance.

722
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,678
Don't touch me, ok?.
.Estelle.

723
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,759
Look, just fucking go fuck your
Mexican whore you like so much!

724
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,869
Come on, keep cool, Perdita.
Come on.

725
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,313
Never done it in a plane,
how about you?.

726
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,790
Pick a card.
-Go to sleep, Romeo.

727
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,913
We have a long night ahead us.
-Precisely. Don't you want to know

728
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:27,919
what's going to happen tomorrow?
-I nearly forgot that you're

729
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,272
a crazy Santero.
-Every Santero uses his power

730
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,393
to predict the future. Even those of
us who are crazy. Pick a card.

731
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,909
Luck. Plenty off luck.
Anyone wanna try?

732
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,393
Come on, Duane.
The cards are sacred. They never lie.

733
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,872
Ignore him, he's making fun of us.

734
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:56,319
They are 18 cards and only
one of them is really bad.

735
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,513
But it's not this one.
You're still a lucky guy, man.

736
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,517
And now it's my turn.

737
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,273
Sir, we've spotted a group that fits
their description. They're in

738
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,393
a rest-stop just outside of El Paso.
-Follow but do not intercept.

739
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:34,673
If Dolorosa suspects anything
he's gonna kill those kids.

740
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,913
Call our people in Las Vegas. Tell
'em I want to find the warehouse

741
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,919
where they store those fetuses.
-That won't be easy, sir.

742
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,993
Start with all the cosmetic labs.
There can't be that many.

743
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:51,033
And tell them move their ass!
Hey, what's red and white

744
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,073
and goes 60 Miles an hour?
A baby in a blender.

745
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,312
Sons of bitches will never find her!

746
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,716
What?
-Once they cross the border,

747
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,315
they can't ask for any favors.
.What border?

748
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,393
Mexican. I've to go after her myself.
Even if my wife thinks I'm crazy.

749
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,558
Sometimes it's better not to think so
much. Maybe you should read the paper.

750
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,718
No, no, no. That's no relief.

751
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,315
A man's gotta do what
his heart tells him to do.

752
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,473
You understand what I mean?
You can't always be in control.

753
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,912
Did you see what I just did?.
It wouldn't have happened

754
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,316
ifyou'd been here. Think about it!

755
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,472
Some strange men came asking for you.

756
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,512
We said nothing.

757
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,310
They said you owed Catalina money,

758
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:35,233
but I know they were lying
because I raised you

759
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,319
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

760
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,913
I was not afraid, I have seen
so much, my grandson.

761
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,679
Even invisible things.
When you were born I knew

762
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:06,759
you were special that when you died,
you'd turn into a jaguar

763
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,872
and run along Caribbean beaches.

764
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:22,279
Everything ok?.
-This place is like

765
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:26,233
an elephant graveyard.
Why are you awake?

766
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,319
Something's burning you inside.
-It's nothing.

767
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,232
It's your little girlfriend.

768
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:39,313
My head is ringing from 12 hours
of uninterrupted teenage bullshit.

769
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,230
You're jealous. I like that.

770
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,914
Hey! Hey! Wake up! Wake up!

771
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,953
Come her! Come here! Look! Look!
So, it's our chance to escape.

772
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,953
If we find another way out of here,
they'll never find us.

773
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,953
Estelle, you're crazy!
-Do you actually like that bitch?

774
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,113
No, I'm trying to keep us alive.
-You're fucking coward!

775
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,073
Second time you've called me that!
.Go ahead and hit me!

776
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,311
Deep down, you're just like them!

777
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,318
Ok.

778
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,551
Come on.

779
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,552
I don't see them. Hurry up!

780
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,471
Go!

781
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,351
Go! Go! Go!

782
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,470
Fuck!

783
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,830
Hurry up!

784
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,797
Go! They're behind us!

785
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,394
Faster! Faster!

786
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,399
Faster! Faster!

787
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:36,558
I thought you were stupid, but it
didn't think you were a traitor!

788
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,913
I don't like traitors, Duane!
I don't like traitors! Understand?.

789
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,279
Shit, Duane, I trusted you!
I fucking trusted you,

790
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,279
and this is how you repay me?
I'm going to fuck you over.

791
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,279
I'm gonna kill you, ok?
Do you wanna know how it's gonna end?

792
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,313
This is it, man! This is fucking it!
-Oh, God! No, no, no! Please!

793
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,319
It wasn't his fault! It was me!
It won't happen again. It was my idea!

794
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,318
Forget it, Romeo!
-You shut up!

795
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:09,393
Perhaps we can use him in Las Vegas.
Come on, this could bring us bad luck.

796
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,473
How things changed! Before, you wanted
to shoot them in the desert,

797
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,513
now you're defending them!
-Nobody wants to defend anybody, ok?.

798
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,873
This is not the right thing here, now.
-Now I'm the jealous one. Ok, Perdita?

799
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,913
Estelle, what do you think?
Looks like they want to be alone.

800
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,873
It wasn't his fault, it was me.
-Fucking asshole!

801
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,913
You decide, Estelle, I finish him off
or I keep him alive to please Perdita.

802
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,953
Forget it, Romeo! You're getting
out of hand. Let's get out of here.

803
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:44,391
Stand up, gringo! Come on, Duane.

804
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,393
How do you do it, man? Some day
you have to tell me your secret.

805
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,717
Understand? You don't beat!

806
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,716
Reggie, my friend. Come in.

807
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,871
Have a seat.

808
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,708
You know why you're here?
-I think so, yes.

809
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,872
Is that a problem for you?.

810
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:27,713
Ok. I know you're raised up
together in one family.

811
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,833
It takes a pretty long time
when se left Petit Caribe.

812
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,873
I don't object your cousin.
But he did some ugly things.

813
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,718
Even the Mexican Government wants
him to get off.

814
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:49,318
The Government is after my business.
Several of our associates are dead.

815
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,593
Mr. Santos, if I only knew this...
-Don't excuse yourself.

816
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,598
No one is accusing you
of doing anything.

817
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,679
Romeo is doing me a favor
by driving the merchandise

818
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,713
for which he'll be compensated.
When the delivery is secure

819
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,390
give him the money we agreed on.

820
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,194
Then kill him.

821
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,791
Money is no good to him, he's dead.

822
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,872
So you take it
for doing me this favor.

823
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,390
That's most generous ofyou.
.Generous?

824
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,951
Just!

825
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:32,153
Treason is merely
a tool of resourcefulness.

826
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,316
I know this will be hard for you
but I firmly believe

827
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:41,672
that man must live his life
according to his own terms

828
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,713
or not live this life at all.
-I'm sure you are right, Mr. Santos.

829
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,319
And I'm sure
you'll do a good job for me.

830
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,913
I figure my little ladies are
wondering where I'm heading.

831
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:22,239
I'll visit a friend in Nogales.
Estrellita, come with me.

832
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,311
What for?

833
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:28,394
I'm thinking of selling you.
Get in, pendejo.

834
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,309
Where the hell are you going?

835
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,633
I'm going to dance with the devil
under the pale moonlight.

836
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,593
Go fuck yourself, Romeo!
-What's wrong? It's from Batman.

837
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,712
Fuck Batman!

838
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,193
One hit, one dollar! You want a hit?
You wanna hit, man?

839
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,318
Fuck, yeah!
.One dollar.

840
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,359
Here's 10, kick my ass!
-Si, senor, for 10 dollars

841
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,313
I make your hair sizzle!
-That's a car battery!

842
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,234
Give it me, motherfucker!
-Very macho, man! Very macho!

843
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:26,233
Give it to me!
Give it to me, motherfucker!

844
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,310
Oh, fuck!

845
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,711
Electricity is cool, Estrellita.

846
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,879
I'm looking for Catalina.
I heard he is here today.

847
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,913
Catalina. About a debt.
.He's at the back.

848
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:49,152
Romeo Dolorosa.

849
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,319
Girls, I want you to meet
a real bandido.

850
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,870
Ladies.
-We heard you were doing a job for

851
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,913
Santos with your cousin Reggie.
-Fuck! You keep yourself informed.

852
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:06,113
You have to keep up with everything
in this business. When you don't know

853
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:10,153
what's happening, you're dead!
-Listen, Catalina, I'm here

854
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,476
to settle my debt.
I don't like owing anyone anything.

855
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,398
Well, you know that.

856
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,398
Did you hear that, girls?.

857
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,513
The son of a bitch says
he doesn't like owing money to anyone.

858
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:26,870
So you came here to pay me?

859
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,876
Sure. Yeah. And this is half.

860
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:35,953
I'll give you the other half
somewhere were we can talk.

861
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:40,708
Where did you find this beauty?

862
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:44,913
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. She's the other half.

863
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,558
Come to my office.

864
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,592
You too, sweetie.

865
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,912
Stay here! Stay here, girls!

866
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,598
I don't want any.
-How come?. It's pure. Good stuff.

867
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:15,599
Come on, Catalina, she's not one
of those girls. She hasn't tried

868
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:19,633
anything stronger than a diet Coke!
-Bullshit, Romeo. Gimme that!

869
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,717
She's terrific. Innocent, clean.

870
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,512
And her pussy's pure gold, man!

871
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,519
You'll make triple what you make
with those dried-up cunts.

872
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,553
Where did you get her?
-Well, does it matter? We got a deal?

873
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,553
What are you talking about?
-Estrellita, Estrellita,

874
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,593
now this man owns you, ok?
And please don't make me look bad.

875
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:48,553
You can't be serious.
-You're right. She's great!

876
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,393
Let's toast.
-I hear you visited Petit Caribe?.

877
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:57,319
No, no, no. I had no time.
I sent my associates.

878
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,870
They did a good job.

879
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,553
See, I don't like being owed money.
But you learned your lesson now.

880
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,593
You're all paid up. That's it.
Everything is forgotten.

881
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,279
No, Catalina, it's not forgotten.
-Then why the fuck did you come here?

882
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:17,471
To kill you, pendejo!

883
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,792
I'm dead so are you.

884
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:04,273
Santos will kill you.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

885
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,913
Your cousin sold you out,
you sick fuck! Everyone knows it.

886
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,912
You're lying!
-Reggie's gonna kill you

887
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,953
after you make the delivery.
I'll be waiting for you in hell.

888
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,711
We'll have a great time there.

889
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:30,311
See you later, amigo.

890
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,071
Remember,

891
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:51,113
whatever happens, keep smiling, ok.
No long faces. Right?

892
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,397
Nothing happened in here, ok?

893
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,317
Dance! Dance!

894
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,711
Dance!

895
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,314
Holy shit! He wasted him!
Son of a bitch!

896
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:22,033
You saved my life
back at the airplane junkyard.

897
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,478
Thank you.

898
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,513
Don't thank me.
Maybe what awaits you could be worse.

899
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,913
I bet sometimes...
you wish you never met him.

900
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,679
Who?

901
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,711
Romeo.

902
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:46,076
Listen. There's a lot of people in my
fucking life that I wish I never met

903
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,113
but Romeo is definitely
not one of them, ok?

904
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:55,553
You ever think about an animal
eating you alive?

905
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:00,313
I thought Romeo was going to kill me.
-I'm not talking about that.

906
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:05,153
I'm talking about a wild animal
grabbing you an ripping you apart.

907
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,433
I don't think of things like that.
-That's why you're so boring.

908
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,473
Strangest people come up with
the most interesting ideas, Duane.

909
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,790
I've never met anybody like you.
.I know.

910
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:28,796
Let's go! Let's go!

911
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:35,759
Why do you follow Romeo? Why don't
you just take off and leave him?

912
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:39,793
Why don't you just shut up, please?
-Are you in love with him?

913
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,631
In love?.

914
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:49,639
You sound like a fucking
Judith Krantz novel.

915
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,913
I'm just waiting for my money
and then I'll be gone.

916
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,790
There won't be any money,
it's a trap.

917
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,311
What the fuck are you talking about?!

918
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,393
I know there's someone named Santos
who wants to kill Romeo in Las Vegas.

919
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,473
A Mexican man told him before dying.
.Don't fuck with me!

920
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:14,315
What the fuck are you saying?

921
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,432
It's the truth.

922
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,433
What? No, no, no. Forget the cops.
They know less than you and me!

923
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,912
Don't cry, sweetie.

924
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,431
How would you feel if I started crying
instead of going out looking for her?

925
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,316
Estelle?.!

926
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:56,353
You cannot escape me!
You will be my love slave forever.

927
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,313
Turn it off. All that jumping
is making me nervous.

928
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:09,359
They jump so much because they have
super powers. Don't you understand?

929
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,312
Here. Cocksuckers!

930
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,472
Who the fuck is that!

931
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,873
They said you grew another arm from
drinking so much Tequila, cabron!

932
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,868
Fucking Romeo!

933
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,708
It's been a long time, man!
-A long time.

934
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:32,312
You came here? You need something.
-I do need your help like always, guy.

935
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:37,513
I want you to meet my friends.
The poor little Duane.

936
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,553
My sad princess Estelle and that's
Perdita Durango.

937
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:48,753
In the last 48 hours, I've had
2 near.death accidents.

938
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:53,996
Mexican Mafia tried to shoot at me.
Some fucking animal tried to rip

939
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:58,033
my fucking head off and I haven't
had breakfast yet.

940
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,313
Please, don't fuck with me today, ok?
All right? Just do you job.

941
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,312
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid to listen
to other people's problems. Hm?

942
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:14,756
No, you're right! But you are getting
paid to listen to my fucking problems

943
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,793
'cause I'm your boss and I own you,
you little shit! So do your job!

944
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:22,873
Oh, please, I'm so sorry. We're both
very tired, you understand

945
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,913
I'm also tired! I haven't been shot
at but I've had 2 consecutive shifts

946
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,953
sitting in front of the fucking
computer and I wanna go home to sleep!

947
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:36,633
Yes. Yes, but first...
.There it is!

948
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:40,673
That's the same fucking list!
-I told you.

949
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:44,679
Practically every company has some
type of problems with the law.

950
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:48,713
Fines, toxins, illegal animal trade.
Yes, rhinoceros horns, dog fat...

951
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,553
Shut up with the fucking animals!
Look at this! They're in Tucson

952
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,593
and they're gonna be here in
4 hours...And we have nothing!

953
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,916
Dick! Shit! Nothing!
-I'm sorry.

954
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:09,793
Ok. Print all the companies that
don't have any violations.

955
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,279
What?

956
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,313
All the companies that don't have
any violations, that are clear. Print!

957
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:24,719
3 and one of them is still
under construction.

958
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:36,073
Estelle, what's gotten into you?
-Forgive me for calling you a coward.

959
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:42,309
Forget it.
-lt was to get you to react.

960
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,717
It's ok. Really.

961
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:55,793
Estelle, they can see us.
-Great, let them see!

962
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,716
Oh, my God!

963
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:06,391
I can't believe it.
-Come on, Duane.

964
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,872
Estelle. My God!

965
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:12,799
This might be our last chance
to do it.

966
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:26,399
Anything wrong?
-No, everything is just dandy.

967
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,678
Did I miss anything?.
-Life's a bitch, huh?.

968
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:49,633
That guy just
got hit by a car across the street.

969
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,833
You lose sight for a second...
-Death came as a surprise to him.

970
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:59,153
There'll be many more surprises
when we arrive to that place.

971
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,397
Well, I don't like surprises.

972
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,797
Hey, you! Everything is ready.

973
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:19,394
I don't think this is a good idea.
-Don't worry.

974
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:23,673
They're good people, good friends
of mine. Doug was in Beirut with me.

975
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,633
What did he do, leave his arm there?
-Very funny, Perdita.

976
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:31,679
I crossed the battlefield with that
arm. It took me hours to get it

977
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:35,713
to the hospital. I got there too late,
though. It rotted.

978
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,712
Take me with you. Come on!

979
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,354
He only has one fucking arm!

980
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,879
No.

981
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,879
Someone has to take care of
the kids. I don't trust Lilly

982
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:52,913
and Doug is an ex-marine.
-Don't fuck with me, ok?

983
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,158
I don't want you coming, period.
Is that good enough?

984
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:01,279
A piece of cake, Perdita. Drop the
merchandise, pick up the money,

985
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:05,313
and that's it. We'll be back before
you notice we're gone.

986
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,270
I don't like
leaving things half done.

987
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,273
I don't want to make my cousin
look bad.

988
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,914
Your cousin?

989
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,791
Fuck!

990
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:15,317
I wanted to fuck you one more time...

991
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:22,791
Romeo left these for you.

992
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,517
Where are the keys?
-What keys?

993
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,472
For the handcuffs.
.I have them.

994
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,511
Give 'em to me.

995
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:41,553
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
My husband said

996
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,513
no one leaves until
he or Romeo return.

997
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,911
Ok.

998
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,314
Pick a card.
-What's this? A game?

999
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,592
It's your future.

1000
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,714
What does it mean?
.Bad luck.

1001
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,231
Shit!

1002
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:10,114
Where are we going now?
-Our little trip is over.

1003
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:14,119
You're letting us go?
-That's right. I can't be driving you

1004
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:18,153
around all the time, huh?
-You're going after him, aren't you?

1005
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:22,593
It's your lucky day, sweetheart. Don't
blow it by asking stupid questions.

1006
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:26,152
Now go! Go!

1007
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,152
Bye, Perdita.

1008
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:56,513
Doyle, I fucking hate you!
I hate your little TV

1009
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,553
and I hate your glasses
and I hate your stupid fucking tie!

1010
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,799
Did you say something, Sir?
-No, nothing.

1011
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:09,708
Do you see anything?
-Not a thing, sir.

1012
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,872
Everything's quiet, nothing's moved.

1013
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:17,679
Motherfucker, you're not gonna have
this job much longer 'cause I'm gonna

1014
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:21,679
tell 'em put you back in uniform and
right back out on the street.

1015
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:25,679
As a matter of fact, when I get
through with you, you will guard

1016
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:29,759
Iittle shopping malls and put the
shopping carts back where they belong.

1017
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,913
It's here! The truck! It's here!
-What the heck are you doing?

1018
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:05,233
Right... Call the station.
And tell them I was right.

1019
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:08,712
Right away, Sir.

1020
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,711
Fuck it!

1021
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,791
Shit!

1022
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:06,072
Bayou Chemical lndustries.

1023
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:10,113
Just opposite the Lock Shop
on Nevada Boulevard.

1024
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:15,039
It's ok, Woody, all on their way.
All the units are on their way.

1025
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:19,073
Shut up! And don't call me Woody!
'Cause I can't fucking stand it!

1026
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:22,510
You understand? Don't call me Woody!

1027
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,914
Hey, cousin.
-Hey, man. You've brought our pal.

1028
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:41,914
Hi, Doug.
-You haven't changed.

1029
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:47,713
Nothing's changed. Right, Reggie?
-Like always, us three.

1030
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:53,156
Here's the money. Take it.

1031
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,150
Count it.

1032
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:00,913
I trust you.

1033
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:06,031
Shit!

1034
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,833
Fuck!

1035
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,912
Reggie,

1036
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:27,713
I love you, Reggie.
Why are you doing this to me?

1037
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,315
We are no longer in Petit Caribe,
Romeo.

1038
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:35,909
I know.
-There's no other way out, man.

1039
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:39,828
It's either you or me. What do you
ant me to do?

1040
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,833
There's always another way out,
Reggie.

1041
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,397
Look at me!

1042
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,390
Look at me!

1043
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,630
Oh, Romeo...

1044
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,430

1045
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,914
Hold it!
-Nobody move!

1046
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,312
He's dead.
-Golly gee Mothercrist!

1047
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:31,392
Look at his teeth!

1048
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,796
Incredible!

1049
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,318
What happend?

1050
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,871
I'm tired.

1051
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,913
I'm so weak.

1052
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,552
And I'm lonely.

1053
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,395
I hurt so much.
I feel it hard to explain.

1054
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,637
I can't trust love.

1055
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:22,871
Because it won't stay the same.

1056
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:26,314
Wow! Tired!

1057
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,310
I'm so weak.

1058
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:35,316
And I'm lonely.

1059
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:59,316
I need somebody...

1060
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,914
