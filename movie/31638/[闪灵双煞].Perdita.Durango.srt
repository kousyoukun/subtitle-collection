2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,391
Want another? Sweetie!

3
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,717
Bring me another Bud. And for you?
- What would you like?

4
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,514
Coke.
- Diet?

5
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,713
You fuckin' kidding?

6
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:17,760
You live in Mexico?
- Not exactly.

7
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:22,399
Hey, you heading out somewhere?
- Nowhere now. What about yourself?

8
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:26,278
Phoenix. 4 day software convention.

9
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:29,122
I'm a software salesman.

10
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:33,681
By the way, my name is Manny Flynn.
Half Jewish, half Irish.

11
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:37,440
What's yours?
- Perdita Durango.

12
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:41,445
Ah, that's a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman. Married?

13
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,677
Listen, Manny,

14
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:52,722
you want me to go to Phoenix with you?
You pay me way, you buy my meals.

15
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:56,961
I'll keep your dick
hard for 4 straight days.

16
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,240
While you're at the convention,
I'll do a little business myself.

17
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,283
Plenty of guys there, right?
I show some tit, milk a little cow.

18
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,286
Quick and clean. 50 bucks a pop.

19
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,324
I'll let you keep half of the profit.
How about it?

20
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,523
I gotta go.

21
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,443
Asshole!

22
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:34,725
Hands up! Hands up!

23
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:39,530
You're sisters?

24
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:44,969
Well, I had a sister, too.
Her name was Juana.

25
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:50,290
She had two little girls
that looked just like you.

26
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,091
You wanna see my sister? Yeah?

27
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:57,130
Open it.

28
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,452
That's my sister.
Her husband shot and killed her.

29
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,252
And then he took his gun

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,768
pointed to one

31
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,212
and then the other little girl
and he shot them both in the head.

32
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,696
Bang! Bang!

33
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,657
Thank you.

34
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:57,508
I need a drink.

35
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,953
Please stay behind the line
until you are called forward.

36
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,680
All citizens entering the
United States with goods to declare

37
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,684
please move to the red corridor.

38
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:04,720
Remain in your vehicle until
interviewed by an Officer.

39
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:58,604
Forget it.
- My little virgin,

40
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:02,614
I think today is my lucky day.
- But not mine.

41
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,615
Lo siento, but I'm in a
bad mood today.

42
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:12,330
Come on, everybody needs somebody.
Even woman like you, Srta. Spitfire.

43
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:18,607
My name is Romeo Dolorosa.
My grandma is a witch,

44
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:22,652
my father was a Spaniard,
and I have a Mexican ranch.

45
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,973
Do you wanna come with me?

46
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,653
Well, my name is Perdita Durango

47
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,659
and I don't know shit about my fucking
parents and I don't wanna know shit

48
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,694
about your fucking little ranch.

49
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:44,255
You remind me of someone.
- Yeah? Who, Doris Day?

50
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:49,496
Let me guess.
You're from Hollywood, right?

51
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,576
Probably think you can turn me
into a big star?

52
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:58,061
But by the way you're dressed,
you remind me more of a faggot

53
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:02,178
or an extra in a bad Black
Sabbath video.

54
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,294
I like it.

55
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:10,134
Well, the truth is, I'm a scientist.
- A scientist?

56
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:13,098
No, you're definitely a dentist.

57
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,782
I could tell from that stupid smile
on your face.

58
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:20,787
It's the truth. Science is everything.
Scientists need money,

59
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:25,583
like everyone else. They need funds
to continue their research.

60
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:29,662
So, that's why I'm here
on this side of the border.

61
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,748
I see. Well, you're looking to the
wrong person for a donation. So...

62
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,180
Don't worry.
We have plenty of donations.

63
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,263
Like 12.000 dollars I just received

64
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,745
this morning
from the Morgens Interstate Bank.

65
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,785
Keep quiet! Fucking hell!
I don't want one fucking move!

66
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:50,905
Don't move! Don't fucking move!
- Shut up!

67
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:56,066
If you keep quiet, nothing's
gonna happen, alright?

68
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,787
The money! Quick! Here!

69
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:06,588
Take off your shirt.
Come on, take off your shirt!

70
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:10,710
What the fuck are you doing, man?!
You're crazy!

71
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,748
Come on, show me your titties.
Keep going...

72
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:17,789
The bra... Come on, the bra! The bra!
- What the fuck you doing, man?!

73
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,745
It's not the time!
- Oh, Good Lord!

74
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:25,469
Come here!
- Do you hear me? Let's go! Shit!

75
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:29,193
Sweet mother of God!
Move! Move! Move!

76
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,113
Come on, Romeo! Are you nuts, or what?
Run! Fuck you!

77
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:49,513
Santero psychopath!

78
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:04,082
Ok, thank you very much.
Here you go, the mask of El Santo.

79
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:07,719
It will bring you good luck.
Thank you very much.

80
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:11,758
You had to do it your way!
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

81
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:16,124
It's the last time I'm working
with you, Cabron! Fucking clown!

82
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:20,685
Piece of shit, Santero. He had
to wear that fuckin' little mask,

83
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:24,322
you know, like El Santo.

84
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:29,246
Hey, man, how much did we get?
- I don't know, man! I don't know.

85
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:33,247
Maybe 20.000, maybe more.
- I hope it's more. At least 25.

86
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:37,247
One grand for each and the rest for
the mother-fucking Catalina!

87
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:41,680
Forget about Catalina, Cabron.
- It's scary, man! I'm scared shitless!

88
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,799
Last week, we owed him 20 grand,
and now it's 23!

89
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,203
If we don't pay him soon, he'll kill
us and make a belt with our nipples!

90
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:58,131
Y eso no es funny, no senor.
We shouldn't have borrowed

91
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,801
money from him, I told you,
I told... Romeo?

92
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,443
Romeo!

93
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,204
Fuck!

94
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,487
Holy fucking shit!
I'll get you, man! I'll get you!

95
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:29,527
Your luck is running out today, uh?
- Trust science, Perdita.

96
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:33,536
I have different plans of my own.
I get out of here. I'll donate my body

97
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:37,127
to science when I'm dead.
- You don't have to.

98
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:41,211
I already took care of that. Look.
- Are you fucking crazy?

99
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:44,771
C'mon trust in my science, Perdita.

100
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,971
Do you want to cross the border
with me?

101
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,053
So what the fuck are you?
A grave-robber or a bank-robber?

102
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:59,494
I do it all, my love.
I got a really busy schedule today.

103
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:22,613
Your papers, please.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:41,622
Anything to declare?
- Nothing, Officer.

105
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,063
All right. You may continue.
- Thank you.

106
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,625
Trust in science, Perdita.
Trust in science.

107
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:10,825
I come from the island Petit Caribe,
3 Miles long, 1 Mile wide.

108
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:15,431
When I was a kid, there were only
2 cars. And one day, of course,

109
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,828
they crashed.

110
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,632
Sooner or later,
it was bound to happen.

111
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:28,669
It was impossible for it not
to happen. That's how the world turns.

112
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:33,229
That's how you and I met, Perdita.

113
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:15,631
You'll be my Yalocha...
- What?

114
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:19,233
My High Priestess.

115
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:23,794
You can help me with the ritual.
Last night I dreamt about it,

116
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:27,519
I dreamt I was licking your body.

117
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:29,714
Stop! Stop!

118
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,637
Did I do this?

119
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,118
What the fuck are you talking about?!

120
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:43,159
I'm a sorcerer, Perdita.
Your Babalou.

121
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:47,440
It's rule of Ocha.
Santeria, my science.

122
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,841
Don't talk shit o me. You don't
believe in those things, do you?

123
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:56,720
I do believe in its power.

124
00:14:57,008 --> 00:15:00,843
You want to see it or are you scared?

125
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,155
I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Why not? It scares evil spirits away.

126
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:35,240
I don't believe in voodoo bullshit.
I doubt if those people did either.

127
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,162
It's not voodoo. It's Santeria.
It's not the same.

128
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,315
Little magical tricks.
Latin bullshit.

129
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:46,357
But it works. You saw it.
- Yeah, but for how long?

130
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:49,601
You know, people are not that stupid.
- Yeah,

131
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:52,762
do you have a better idea, smartass?

132
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,156
Yeah,

133
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,357
you know what?

134
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,676
We should kill someone.
- What?

135
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah, we should kill them
and then we should eat them.

136
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:17,642
Fuck! Like animals, mi amor?
- That's right.

137
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,768
It'll be ingrained
in their brains forever.

138
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,482
Let's do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow is not good.

139
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,285
I have a date across the border.
- A date?

140
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,730
Son of a bitch.
- It's not what you think.

141
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,691
It's business.

142
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:52,204
Being a kid in Caribe, I spent every
day in the port with my cousin Reggie.

143
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:56,294
There were huge ships, everyone going
to different places.

144
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,573
Panama, Mexico, Hong Kong, Lisboa.
Places that we couldn't imagine.

145
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:07,569
From the moment, I knew I would go
far into the world, beyond Caribe.

146
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:11,049
Yeah? What went wrong?
- What do you mean?

147
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:15,056
This isn't exactly Paris, sweetheart.
- Fuck you!

148
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:19,571
Fuck! I lived in Paris for 2 years,
mademoiselle, and 4 years in Madrid.

149
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:23,375
You know Madrid? Look at this...
Mira, mira. Esto...

150
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,298
I got this from a bull.
I was a bullfighter.

151
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,571
And this is fuckin' souvenir
from Beirut. The Marines!

152
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,613
The greatest travel agency
in this fuckin' wide world.

153
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:42,300
What are you thinking in that
little head of yours?

154
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,573
I'm thinking,

155
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,616
that if we're gonna do a kidnapping,
we should get a gringo.

156
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,861
A guero?
- It'll be impressive.

157
00:20:56,624 --> 00:21:00,299
Adolfo, did you hear that?
- Killing gueros?

158
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:05,498
Fucking hell! Living with you
will be kickass!

159
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:22,186
(Song) Who can turn the world on
with her smile?

160
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:25,504
Coming! Coming! I'm coming!

161
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:31,901
Hello, Mrs. Satisfy.

162
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:35,499
Is Estelle here?
- Of course she is.

163
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,270
Come on in. Come on in. Estelle?

164
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,463
Estelle, honey, Duane's here.

165
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:47,227
Oh, please don't make him wait.
Now, come on down!

166
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,628
Hello, Mr. Satisfy.
- Hi.

167
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:55,223
I'll be down in a second.

168
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:04,388
Estelle! Don't you hear me?
Come down!

169
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:08,588
What is Duane gonna think
of us? Oh, she is the worst!

170
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,189
Duane,

171
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:16,229
in this world, you have to be
in control.

172
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:20,270
It's the only thing that
makes us different from the animals.

173
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:24,276
Absolutely, Mr. Satisfy.
- Ah, you can call me Herb.

174
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:28,436
You know, when we were dating,
Glory Ann always called me Herb

175
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:32,392
after Herb Alpert, the musician.
You know?

176
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,353
The Tijuana Brass, you heard of them,
right?

177
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,511
Well,

178
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,838
not really...
- What is that?

179
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:49,874
It's a free-form mobile, representing
the 4 basic food groups...

180
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:53,153
Here they come.
- Ta-ta-ta-ta!

181
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:55,955
Here she is!

182
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,479
You look beautiful.
- Ok, you two kids.

183
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:03,516
Go out now and have a good time.
- Estelle said you're heading to Susie?

184
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:08,317
Ah, that's where the young ones go
to have fun nowadays?

185
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:12,043
Yeah, well...
- Let's go, Duane, otherwise

186
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:16,078
we might never get out of here.
- Duane, remember what I told you.

187
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,876
(Together) Always be in control!

188
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,440
They haven't arrived yet.

189
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,880
No. Where is Perdita?
- Shopping.

190
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:27,895
My, God! Are you alright, Sir?
I could've killed you!

191
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:31,725
Call an ambulance! Call for help!

192
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,014
Alright, alright, alright!

193
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:40,533
Please, stop touching me!
Stop touching me!

194
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:42,610
Shit!

195
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,731
Excuse me, Sir...

196
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:03,732
It's the Holy Bible.

197
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:17,937
You also have a letter.
Is it a secret admirer?

198
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,824
Oh, my God! Is my number one fan.
Is my grandmother Maria Jose, man!

199
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:28,339
I love her! I love that woman.
She always writes o me, man.

200
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:32,541
The oldest woman in Petit Caribe.
I mean, no one knows how old she is.

201
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:36,580
Whatever happened in my country,
she was there to tell the story.

202
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:40,620
She can't write, so she dictates her
letters to my cousin Danny Mestiza.

203
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:43,341
Even when my cousin Reggie and I were
in Beirut, she sent me a letter.

204
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:47,428
We got the money you sent.
Danny says thanks, and so do I.

205
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:54,623
I'm reading the Bible, looking for
the place where you're fighting.

206
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,742
Have you seen the Garden of Eden?

207
00:26:23,794 --> 00:26:26,753
Did you see it?
- What, man?

208
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,827
The Garden of Eden.

209
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:33,909
Of course! Fuck, Adolfo, of course,
man! That's when I saw the Devil.

210
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,669
Garlic sprouted everywhere
he stepped.

211
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:47,790
There they are. Stay put.

212
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,909
Wait.

213
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:12,354
Primo!
- Reggie, man!

214
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,799
Hey, man! I missed you, asshole!

215
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,753
As elegant as ever. How's business?

216
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:25,958
I get by...
- That's over, man, that's over!

217
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:29,753
We're too big for this fucking border.

218
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:34,118
I'm changing your luck, Romeo.
You know Marcelo Santos?

219
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:39,199
Crazy Eyes Santos?
- Don't ever call him that!

220
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:43,279
He hates it. It pisses him off.
- Are you working for him now?

221
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,280
I told you, man, big business.
Big business!

222
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:51,759
Listen. You're my brother. My brother.

223
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:56,758
Mr. Santos wants to meet you.

224
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:01,922
He's here?
- In the car.

225
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:17,649
Mr. Dolorosa.
You like the jabugo ham?

226
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:21,327
It's illegal but delicious.
- Thanks. It's a pleasure

227
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:25,332
meeting you, Mr. Santos.
- I know it's a strange place to meet,

228
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:29,366
but I'm on my way to another business
meeting, and I hate to fly. Drink?

229
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,405
Yeah, thanks.

230
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:35,446
Your cousin Reggie,
he speaks very highly of you.

231
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,488
He tells me you send money back home
to your family. I like that.

232
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:45,172
Well, Reggie and I are very tight,

233
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:48,925
but he might have exaggerated
a little, Mr. Santos.

234
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:53,368
You don't have to be humble with me.
I need someone like you by my side.

235
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:58,091
Here's my proposal. It's very simple.
In 48 hours, a truck will arrive.

236
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:02,972
A refrigerated, semi-trailer truck
loaded with human embryos

237
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:06,571
for the cosmetic industries.

238
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,019
You make a skin cream with fetuses?
- Not a bad idea, although it's not

239
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:15,133
originally mine. You see, the Nazis
made bars of soap out of the Jews.

240
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:21,731
Yeah, and you adapted it to our times?
- More or less. People want to be

241
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:25,741
so beautiful nowadays, hu? You have
to give them that they want.

242
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:29,901
Sure, everyone wants to look younger.
- Anyway, we must get this shipment to

243
00:29:29,943 --> 00:29:33,936
a secret lab in Las Vegas right away.
- Right. You want me to go with Reggie?

244
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,056
No, I have other plans for him.

245
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:41,097
They tell me that you know the area.
Can you do it?

246
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:44,896
Certainly, Mr. Santos.
I'm glad to help.

247
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:48,780
Muy bueno. Now I have 10.000 dollars
for you in old bills.

248
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:53,980
The driver will have an envelope
with your instructions.

249
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:58,106
When you arrive safely in Las Vegas,
your cousin Reggie will give you

250
00:29:58,147 --> 00:30:03,176
another 10.000 dollars. You remember
always, that God and I are with you.

251
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:32,384
Hey, chica! Looking for someone?
- Where the hell did you get that?

252
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,990
I took it from a kid. Get in.
Get in!

253
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:47,588
Ow! You are a clown, you know that?
- A clown with a golden dick.

254
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:49,745
Right.

255
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:53,951
Look, preciosa, look.

256
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:02,190
Yes! You little devil, you!
So your date was with a bank?

257
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:06,231
No, something better. We have to go
on vacation, isn't that great?

258
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:10,511
And when we get there, there'll be
another package like this. Give me!

259
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:18,438
Sounds like a good plan.
- Yes. We'll leave tomorrow night.

260
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:22,917
We've enough time for our little show.
Adolfo is getting ready everything.

261
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,240
I thought with everything that's
going on, I thought you would probably

262
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:31,115
forget about that Santero.
- Forget about it? Are you crazy?

263
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:35,195
It's the only thing I can think about.
Now more than ever. We need a good

264
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:39,156
sacrifice to appease the gods.
- Well, this is the perfect place.

265
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:43,236
There's nothing but little fuckin'
lambs walking around here.

266
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:48,998
We just have to think about doing it.
- It's easy. Just stop someone and say:

267
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:53,078
I'm Palo Mayombe High Priestess.
Mind if I cut your throat and eat

268
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:57,198
your heart? Ok, what should we get?

269
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:00,316
I don't know.

270
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:04,366
How about something blond, tanned,

271
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,398
muscular?

272
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,884
Are you gonna fuck him or eat him?

273
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:13,885
Maybe both.
- Ok.

274
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,205
Here's your man.
- He's no good.

275
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:52,088
What do you mean he's no good?
- From far away he looked different.

276
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:56,093
Esta fuckin' borracho! I hate drunks.
- What do I do with him now?

277
00:32:56,295 --> 00:33:00,208
I don't know. Why don't you lave him
where you found him?

278
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:03,288
Who the hell are you people?

279
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,408
You crazy bitch!

280
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:09,734
Sorry, man. Who understands women?

281
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:14,010
What are you doing?
- Watch, wait and see.

282
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,252
Shut up! Shut up!
Fucking blow your heads off!

283
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:31,732
Come on! Come on!

284
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:54,496
They're gonna kill the kids! They're
the devils! I saw it in their eyes!

285
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:59,537
They're gonna eat them and come
back for more. Fuck all of you!

286
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:07,738
Excuse me, excuse me!
- Shut up! What're you trying to do?

287
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:10,818
Shh, it's ok, shh...

288
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,619
What's going on?

289
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:18,383
Well, if you're figuring on ransoming,
you know,

290
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:22,387
Estelle's father works in an office.
- Shut up! Do you wanna get us killed?!

291
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:26,421
And my father doesn't have any money.
- The world doesn't spin only on money,

292
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:29,427
pinche guero.

293
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,542
Estelle? Is that your name, princess?
I like it. Estrellita,

294
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:37,583
that's what we'll call you.
Estrellita. You like that, Perdita?

295
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,470
What are you going to do to us?
- Nothing you won't like.

296
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:46,470
Show you where the people live.
Be a place to tell about, if you get

297
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:49,788
a chance on the next family picnic.
- Too bad you won't live to tell it.

298
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:53,746
Please let us go!
- She looks like Barbie.

299
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:57,906
You would stick your dick in a fucking
keyhole if you had the opportunity!

300
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,751
Listen, I understand that your people

301
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:09,024
have been, you know, oppressed by our
country. Ok?

302
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:13,235
And I feel for you,
you know? I mean, I really do.

303
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:17,269
But it's not our fault.
It's not our fault! Ok?

304
00:35:17,836 --> 00:35:20,749
Well, why?

305
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:27,037
Are you going to kill us?
- Oh, my God!

306
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:31,748
No, we're not going to kill you.
- Ok, ok.

307
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:35,838
It's gonna be worse. What do you
think about Christmas in fucking hell?

308
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,350
Oh, my God!
- Holiday in hell! Holiday!

309
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,433
A fucking happy holiday!
You make it right, sugar!

310
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,633
You're the best. I love you.

311
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:50,914
Come on! Come on! Don't look at me
like that! Come on, cheer up! Fun!

312
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:54,995
Get party, ok? I'm gonna put a song
on I know you're gonna like.

313
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:58,114
Come on, listen to this.

314
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:01,075
It's Herb Alpert!
- And the Tijuana Brass!

315
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:05,077
This can't be happening!
- It's a sign! It's a sign, Perdita!

316
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:09,197
No hay duda, they are the chosen ones!
- Listen, please. Please, please...

317
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:45,682
Please! Help us!
- Hey! See you around, pendejo!

318
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:02,370
Sheriff?
- What now, Fed?

319
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:06,446
Somebody wants to talk to you.
- Does it have to be now?

320
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:10,693
Says he's from the DEA.
- I'll be damned! A big-shot.

321
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:13,686
Ok, gimme 2 minutes.
- Ok.

322
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,854
And shut the door behind you
on your way out, will you?

323
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:22,886
I'm sorry, Vicky.
We'll have to continue this later.

324
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:28,045
See you tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

325
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:32,446
This way, sir.
- Thank you.

326
00:37:32,857 --> 00:37:36,851
How ya doing? Woody Dumas, Special
Agent for the Federal Narcotics

327
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:39,890
Division up there in Dallas.
- Rip Ford. Sit down.

328
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:43,648
Tell me how I can help you.
What happend to you?

329
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,697
Nothing. Sure is hot in here.

330
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:49,692
That's Susie.
- Thank you.

331
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,170
So, are you up to speed
on this operation?

332
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,219
What operation?

333
00:37:56,261 --> 00:38:00,220
I sent you a fax two days ago.
- Oh, yeah, the fax from Dallas.

334
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:04,221
Yeah, I have it here. You're after
that character, what's his name?

335
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:08,215
Romeo Dolorosa.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be

336
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:12,256
a witch doctor, or something.
- Santero, drug dealer,

337
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:16,058
bank robber, scumbag!
- Here it is.

338
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:22,458
I'll reckon he made it through
your ambush in Del Rio.

339
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:26,458
They say he disappeared like a ghost.
- Well, he was lucky.

340
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,299
Could have been magic, right?
Maybe this Romeo has a cloth doll

341
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:35,056
looks just like you,
stuck full of needles.

342
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,625
It says here his hide-out's
in Mexico.

343
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,666
Yeah, he's got a ranch on the border.

344
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:45,866
I don't see how we can help you.
It's outside of our jurisdiction

345
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:49,868
and it's out of your jurisdiction
too, Special Agent Dumas.

346
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:53,909
Yeah, I know it's outside of your
jurisdiction and I know you're busy,

347
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,943
but I followed this guy for quite a
while and I know he works both sides

348
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,870
of the border wherever the money is.
- It's a big border.

349
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:06,662
Yeah, it is. But unfortunately for
you, they're here in Susie 'cause

350
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,705
I just saw her a few hours ago.
- Her? There's a woman involved, too?

351
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:15,746
Perdita Durango. She's as dangerous
as he is, maybe more.

352
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:20,593
This woman that you say you saw
has she done anything illegal

353
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:24,593
in the State of Texas?
- It's not gonna take her long

354
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:28,594
to break the law.
- Sheriff Ford speaking. Yeah.

355
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:34,309
2 college kids you say? You're sure?
Ok. Yeah, we're coming right away.

356
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:39,390
Yeah, thanks for calling, Phil.
- You know, Ava Gardner.

357
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:43,066
I always loved her lips.

358
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,400
Welcome to Negrita Infante!

359
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:11,074
What's the plan, Romeo?
- Forget about the plan, Adolfo.

360
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:15,315
The future has already been written.
- Cool.

361
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:19,356
You're the boss!
- No, you're the boss!

362
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,555
You're the boss!
- I say you are the boss!

363
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:24,879
Your're...

364
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:28,876
What's wrong with him?

365
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:32,884
This is crazy! Oh, my God!
Where are we!

366
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:37,881
Looks like another planet.

367
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:41,078
This cannot be happening to me!

368
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:45,160
Sleep a little, senorita.
- Please let me go!

369
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:49,166
Don't you know they'll kill us?
- I know nothing, senorita.

370
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:53,241
What? You're with them! Look,
I have 40 dollars and a VISA card.

371
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:57,882
If you let me go,
I'll give you my number.

372
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:02,159
Ok. I'll give it to you now.
It's 7-4-7-0.

373
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,762
You want a blanket?
- Say something!

374
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,922
You want a blanket?
- Why are you doing this to me?

375
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,964
You wanna kill us, too? Is that it?

376
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,203
Fuck!

377
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:46,570
I want to share something with you,
Duane.

378
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:50,974
It's my treasure.

379
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,971
A sticker collection?
It looks interesting.

380
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:20,490
Interesting?!

381
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:24,219
Duane,
when I first saw these drawings,

382
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:28,221
I started looking for answers
to the big questions in life!

383
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:31,892
What the fuck are we doing here,
Duane?

384
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,222
Why do we need to eat?

385
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,264
Why do we need to fuck
or watch TV? Tell me.

386
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:45,264
Do you understand what I'm saying?

387
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:52,499
You're not one of those kids who doesn't
believe in anything? Are you, Duane?

388
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,263
No,

389
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:58,504
I believe in a superior energy.

390
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:01,899
Energy?! Energy?! Fuck energy, Duane!

391
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:06,101
No, no, no! Don't start with
that hippie bullshit, ok?

392
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:10,108
I'm talking about Gods!
Gods creators of fucking universes!

393
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,906
Ok. Ok, all right. I believe, ok?
- Good.

394
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,982
God!

395
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:32,107
So Goldilocks wants to be a hero?
- Shut up!

396
00:43:39,073 --> 00:43:43,067
I expected you to be a stupid-ass
white girl that depends on daddy.

397
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:47,108
I bet your biggest hope is to marry
some cocksucking cowboy, pump out

398
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:51,148
2 blond kids perpetuating the cycle
endlessly. Isn't that right?

399
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:59,155
Give me the gun.
- I don't know what this is about,

400
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:03,110
but I do not wanna die!
- Ok, then kill me.

401
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,713
Go ahead, shoot!

402
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:09,711
But if you miss...
- I know how to shoot a gun!

403
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,673
Really?
I'll give you piece of advice.

404
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,758
I don't need your advice.
- Lf you really wanna do something,

405
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:21,759
do it without thinking about. That's
the difference between you and me.

406
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,039
I would have killed you long time ago.
- For instance the Aztecs,

407
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:31,075
the old inhabitants of this land.
This people had this all figured out

408
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:35,081
thousands of years before
you and I were born, Duane.

409
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:38,354
See this guy? It's me.

410
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:41,515
And this here is you.

411
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:44,361
Food for the Gods.

412
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:48,119
How many men have you fucked?
None?

413
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:51,522
I can't believe it.
You're still a virgin?

414
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:55,918
It's written all over your face.
It's ok. We've all been there.

415
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:01,119
Come on, this is stupid.
Gimme the gun.

416
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:04,000
That's good.

417
00:45:10,928 --> 00:45:14,921
You know what they did to me at
school when I misbehaved?

418
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:18,518
They would whack my hands
with a ruler.

419
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,527
Kiss my feet! Come on!

420
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:35,882
Good girl.

421
00:45:35,931 --> 00:45:39,845
You have to die to live.
- Oh, my God.

422
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:42,123
Exactly.

423
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:45,924
Think of Jesus Christ.

424
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:52,767
Why are millions of people coming
together each Sunday

425
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,931
and drink his blood?

426
00:46:02,535 --> 00:46:04,766
Tell me...

427
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:09,129
didn't you know that one has to
sacrify to the Gods?

428
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:17,928
People forgot their religion.

429
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:22,371
I envy you, really.

430
00:46:22,419 --> 00:46:26,697
Through your sacrifice
you'll be immortal

431
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:28,730
like Jesus.

432
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,817
Telling him a bedtime story, Romeo?

433
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,860
Well, just filling in a few holes
in Duane's education.

434
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:39,934
Well, my little intellectuals,
I have one or two holes

435
00:46:39,981 --> 00:46:42,177
that I need filling, myself.

436
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:45,854
This way. Sit down.

437
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:48,533
Sit down!

438
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:54,222
Here, what are you doing?
What do you want?! Leave me alone!

439
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:58,143
Does it hurt, Estrellita?
Hm, Estrellita.

440
00:46:58,544 --> 00:47:02,140
Light of my life,
fire of my heart.

441
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:07,934
I'm not going to do
anything...

442
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:13,739
I hate her!
- I think your friend Duane likes her.

443
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:17,866
Is he with her?
- I'm afraid so. But don't worry,

444
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:21,901
you're with me.
Romeo will take care of you, mi amor.

445
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:33,108
Put your hands up. Up! Up! Up!

446
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,540
Oh no!

447
00:47:56,953 --> 00:48:00,310
Carajo! What the fuck is this?!
- What?

448
00:48:00,354 --> 00:48:03,346
It's fake.
- Come on, Estrellita,

449
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:07,388
you don't need it. Leave it.
That's for the putas, Estrellita!

450
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:10,106
Carajo!

451
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:14,387
No!

452
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:19,788
What are your goals in life, Duane?

453
00:48:19,837 --> 00:48:21,873
What?

454
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:30,637
What are your plans for the future?
Come on, Duane, goals.

455
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:35,116
All good American boys have them.
How often have you done this, Duane?

456
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,237
Huh?

457
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:51,034
Looks like you start to like me.

458
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,634
I already worried about.

459
00:49:00,643 --> 00:49:04,556
Tell me sweets.
At least, I'm a woman.

460
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,399
Oh, my God.

461
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:41,241
How many times?

462
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:43,761
10?

463
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,881
5?

464
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,162
Fuck! Once?

465
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,562
Shit.

466
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:55,643
So, how was it?
- I'll never forget.

467
00:49:59,572 --> 00:50:03,201
I'll make sure you don't forget,
'cause it'll be the only fuck

468
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:07,246
you'll have in your life.
Time's up, cowboy.

469
00:50:07,453 --> 00:50:09,125
Ow!

470
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:13,167
There's no TV here,
but there's something better

471
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:16,969
I want to show you.
Come on. Get up!

472
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:40,571
The two greatest pleasures in life
are fucking and killing.

473
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:14,940
So...

474
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:18,977
I think it should be you who decides
who is going to be sacrificed.

475
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:22,938
You're the sorcerer.
- What about the gringo?

476
00:51:23,065 --> 00:51:26,137
You chose him.
- Bullshit!

477
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:30,136
You're the one who started this!

478
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:34,179
You know all you wanted was that
little fucking blonde pussy, anyway.

479
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:37,977
The poor girl bled a lot, you know.

480
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:41,060
Just like caramel cream.

481
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:46,747
Well, too bad she's not
a virgin anymore, huh?

482
00:51:46,868 --> 00:51:50,782
Wouldn't it have been
better for your little ceremony?

483
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:53,987
Yeah that's true.

484
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,069
Why didn't I think
about it before? Shit!

485
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,267
Too late now. Anyway, I'm glad we'll
take a trip after the ceremony

486
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:07,305
because they'll be talking about it
for a long, long time.

487
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:13,586
Everything is falling into place.
I'm a lucky man, bonita.

488
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:22,550
Fuck!

489
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:26,986
If you call me bonita one more
fucking time, I'll fucking kill you!

490
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:38,928
Ok, it's time. The show must begin.
Before anything, I want you to know

491
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,935
that it's been a great pleasure
knowing you both.

492
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:46,969
You see, Duane, they'll kill us!
- This can't be happening.

493
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:51,010
I mean, this can't be happening!
- I'm afraid it is, Duane, Cabron.

494
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:55,250
I mean, out there there's a bunch
of people that have come very far

495
00:54:55,297 --> 00:55:00,292
for this and we cannot
let them down. So...

496
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:03,977
one of you will die.
- One? Only one?!

497
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:08,052
Yeah, that's right. Only one. I mean,
Perdita and I haven't decided who.

498
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,693
Best if we decide all together.
- What happens to the other one?

499
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,214
The other one gets a trip to Miami.
What's this here? A fucking contest?!

500
00:55:18,221 --> 00:55:22,215
Ok. Ok. Who votes for Duane?
- I'm sorry, Duane.

501
00:55:22,262 --> 00:55:26,221
Estelle, what the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna die.

502
00:55:26,262 --> 00:55:30,222
But what about me?
- Relax, Cabron. Now you vote.

503
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:34,222
Let's see, whoever thinks, Estelle
should be the one, raise their hand.

504
00:55:34,303 --> 00:55:38,217
You son of a bitch!
- You're the only bitch around here.

505
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:42,224
I saw you fucking him!
- He raped me!

506
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:46,224
That's bullshit!
I saw you moving your ass.

507
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,379
After 2 years of playing square,
I've the same right to live as you do!

508
00:55:50,426 --> 00:55:54,420
When my father finds out what you've
done he'll chop your balls off!

509
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:58,221
Your father's a fucking joke!
- Shut up!

510
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:03,182
Ok. Perdita, what do we do now?
- I don't know.

511
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:07,221
After this fucking circus,
I think they both should die.

512
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:12,218
Excuse me,
the people are getting restless.

513
00:56:13,509 --> 00:56:16,627
Ok, Adolfo, you decide. Which one?
- The gringa.

514
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,190
Who do you think you are?
Romeo, you're not listening to him?

515
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:25,623
I'm sorry, it's been decided.

516
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:30,625
Don't be scared, Estrellita.
Don't be scared.

517
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:36,946
Tonight, you'll be immortal.
You'll enter in the house of dreams

518
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:40,987
where you'll live forever.
Stop crying, Estrellita!

519
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,514
No!

520
00:56:49,235 --> 00:56:53,229
I was 10 years old
when they gave me the necklaces.

521
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:57,309
One for each god. Elegu�, Gemay�,
Chang�, Obatal� and Och�n.

522
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:05,951
Since then, my necklaces have
protected me from evil.

523
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:11,630
Ache, ache, ache...

524
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:14,951
We live on a river bank.

525
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,436
That of the great light.

526
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:20,995
On the other bank
is the great night

527
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,112
where we find force to live!

528
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,996
If we return from the other side,
we'll have power,

529
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:31,397
power over others,
over our enemies.

530
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,521
Somebody help me! Somebody stop him!

531
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:39,837
We must triumph over those
who would keep us

532
00:57:40,483 --> 00:57:43,873
in poverty and sadness!

533
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:53,115
This is the truth.

534
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:55,964
We must devour our enemies

535
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:59,316
before they devour us.
This is the Pinaldo.

536
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:03,115
The saint's born from death.

537
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:08,719
Don't you want to see Romeo eating
your girlfriend's heart out?

538
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:13,199
Just might turn you on.

539
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:17,808
You're a monster!
How can you do this?!

540
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:21,199
Don't blame me, guerito!

541
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:25,243
Don't you remember?
You voted for her, too. Huh?

542
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,046
Enjoy the show, sweetheart.

543
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:38,044
You little piece of shit!

544
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:42,041
Do you feel the fucking pain?

545
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:48,004
Go!

546
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:54,007
See if you fucking like it!

547
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:56,130
Watch!

548
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,327
Only night gives strength
against the light.

549
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:06,255
No sainthood without death.
- Stop it! No!

550
00:59:35,741 --> 00:59:37,811
Romeo!

551
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:30,062
You remember me, honey?
Remember the money we owe Catalina?

552
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:33,862
Well, forget it. Now it's too late.

553
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:38,062
I bring him your fucking head!
Party's over, santero!

554
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:44,623
Bitch! Bitch!

555
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:12,547
Get off me! He's alive!

556
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:15,633
Where's the other kid?

557
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:17,827
Duane!

558
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:21,990
Get in the car! Get in!
Come on! Come on! Shit!

559
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:30,471
Are we gonna stay up here looking?
Plenty of them could've died!

560
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:34,518
They're a bunch of fucking killers!
- Hey! Forget about it, Fed!

561
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:38,512
Remember, we're not here.
- He's right. We can't do anything.

562
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:42,070
Who's this, a relative or something?
- My sister's boy.

563
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,232
Lucky you.

564
01:02:10,284 --> 01:02:13,277
Go! Go! Go!

565
01:02:24,887 --> 01:02:29,165
Fuck! No one says anything, or what?
- What the fuck do you want us to say?

566
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:33,247
Don't you wanna know who that was?
- What for? He's fucking dead!

567
01:02:33,288 --> 01:02:37,328
All I want to know is what the fuck
are we gonna do with these two?

568
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:41,487
Give me time, Perdita, ok?
I'm trying to think of something, ok?

569
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:45,603
Stop it, please stop it! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

570
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:55,241
Stop it! Enough! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

571
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:58,602
It's ok. It's ok.

572
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:03,846
The meeting point is in Junction.
There, we will pick up the truck.

573
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:08,445
If we drive all night,
we could get there on time.

574
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:12,084
We can't be late, Perdita.

575
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:24,175
What's wrong, santero?
Did your gods abandon you?

576
01:03:30,617 --> 01:03:34,656
You see? We lost 'em!
- Relax, he's right in front of us.

577
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:38,293
Just can't see him.
If I go any faster,

578
01:03:38,778 --> 01:03:42,454
he's gonna see us.
- You sure? He could've disappeared.

579
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:46,088
They say Dolorosa' a nagual.

580
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:50,090
A nagual?
- A supernatural beast

581
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,299
that has a human head
and a jaguar's body.

582
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,334
Yeah, and a camel's dick!
- Best of all, he can make himself

583
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:02,375
invisible in front of his enemies.
- Well, that would explain many things.

584
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:06,415
Like how he get across the border?
- Yeah, with two naked and feathered

585
01:04:06,462 --> 01:04:10,376
kids in his back seat.
- You must be kidding.

586
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:16,063
You believe that Mexican bullshit?
- The stuff works if you believe in it.

587
01:04:16,104 --> 01:04:19,653
You know, one time I saw these guys
crash right into a brick wall 'cause

588
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:23,698
they thought they could go through.
- And did they?

589
01:04:23,745 --> 01:04:27,785
Little pieces went through. The rest
stayed splattered all over the wall.

590
01:04:29,026 --> 01:04:33,099
Should it be parked in the middle
of the road with those two inside?

591
01:04:33,706 --> 01:04:37,700
Gonna wait.
You don't fuck around with Santos.

592
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:42,380
I promised Reggie I wouldn't.

593
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:45,540
True, you made a promise.

594
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:49,548
And a Spanish gentleman never
breaks his promise, right?

595
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:53,099
Even if it will cost him his life?

596
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:00,105
What do you want? That's how I am.

597
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:05,544
And you? What if I were killed?
Would you cry?

598
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:18,545
Hey, Skinny? Skinny boy? Hey, what's
are you doing, popsicle dick?

599
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:22,747
Come on, talk to me! Skinny boy?
What's going on? Come on! Come on!

600
01:05:24,474 --> 01:05:28,548
I think he has to pee.
- No, man, he wants to suck your dick!

601
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:32,751
Are you a bit nervous, Pete?
- Nervous? What the fuck would I have

602
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:36,789
to be nervous about, Cabron?
- Shit, partner! Look at the truck!

603
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:40,549
You took 6 amphetamines, cafedrine,

604
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:44,715
Korean, American and Siberian
Ginseng, 16 Giant E-zees!

605
01:05:45,357 --> 01:05:48,350
Vitamins to keep me young.

606
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:52,107
Yoo-hoo! What is it now, Mr. Fetus?

607
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,278
There it is!

608
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,880
Right on time.

609
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,197
Santos knows how to do things right.

610
01:06:29,255 --> 01:06:31,371
Hey, Dolorosa!

611
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:34,885
Cool.
Dede Paralta, Pete Amendariz.

612
01:06:35,055 --> 01:06:38,365
Fuck's up?
- Right smack on time!

613
01:06:39,055 --> 01:06:42,365
Mr. Santos will appreciate that.

614
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:46,886
Your instructions. In Las Vegas,
Reggie San Pedro is waiting for you.

615
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:51,408
I know, I know. He's my cousin.
- That doesn't concern me.

616
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:55,892
Mr. Santos'll be counting on you and I
hope you don't fucking let him down!

617
01:07:06,977 --> 01:07:10,715
Look at you, Skinny, you're frozen!

618
01:07:12,478 --> 01:07:17,030
Piece of shit! Ass-munch!
Fucking gringo cocksuckers!

619
01:07:17,179 --> 01:07:20,536
Shut up!
- Go fuck a cactus!

620
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,530
Estelle...

621
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:32,131
I think it's the police.
Shh... shh.

622
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:44,536
All right, we got 'em. And those
other 3 assholes work for Santos.

623
01:07:45,424 --> 01:07:49,543
We can't go in like this Dumas.
We gotta call in some back-up.

624
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:54,377
Get off me! Go back to your
fucking crossword puzzle!

625
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:57,225
Come on!

626
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,825
Who's that?
- My woman.

627
01:08:01,907 --> 01:08:05,866
The two in the back? Nephews?
What's this? Fucking family picnic?

628
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:09,821
Shit! I hate working
with goddamned morons!

629
01:08:11,948 --> 01:08:15,225
Fuck!
- Alright, assholes! D.E.A.!

630
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:20,909
Drop your guns! Put your hands up!
- Fuck you!

631
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:24,904
Son of a bitch!
- Dede, cover me!

632
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,914
Shit! Goddamned devil!
Just go ahead and kill me!

633
01:09:37,283 --> 01:09:39,354
Skinny!

634
01:09:42,364 --> 01:09:44,355
Skinny!

635
01:09:48,645 --> 01:09:51,956
Now, you dumbfuck!

636
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,560
Shit!

637
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:21,645
Fuck you!

638
01:10:21,771 --> 01:10:25,651
Motherfucker!
- Stop the fucking truck!

639
01:10:25,892 --> 01:10:29,168
Stop the fucking truck!

640
01:10:31,013 --> 01:10:34,562
Your luck has run out, asshole!

641
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,253
Charly, take care of this baby.

642
01:11:30,343 --> 01:11:33,574
Yeah. Thank you very much!

643
01:11:41,745 --> 01:11:44,737
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Get off me!

644
01:11:44,785 --> 01:11:48,256
No, sir, please don't move. Lay down.

645
01:11:52,347 --> 01:11:55,578
Lay down, sir!

646
01:12:22,192 --> 01:12:24,262
Yeah,

647
01:12:24,872 --> 01:12:28,582
the bambinos. Great, great! Yes.

648
01:12:33,434 --> 01:12:37,393
What do we do now?
- They're all dead. Marcello, Peralta,

649
01:12:37,434 --> 01:12:41,394
Armendariz and fucking Skinny!
- They were all good men.

650
01:12:41,435 --> 01:12:45,748
They didn't deserve to die that way.
- Who would have thought that Dolorosa

651
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:49,790
was going to mess everything up?
- He came highly recommended.

652
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:53,830
Seems like D.E.A. Was following
him for a while.

653
01:12:54,317 --> 01:12:59,153
We must act quick to protect the
merchandise. I have to find that man,

654
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:03,192
what's his name?
- Woody Dumas from Dallas. I know him.

655
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:07,273
He's hurting us so bad.
- Everyone wants to get rid of him.

656
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,194
Even his bosses in Dallas.
- Who can we get?

657
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,394
It would be wiser to send an outside
representative to handle the job.

658
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:23,275
Why not send The Fist?
- Yes, Provino Momo The Fist.

659
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:27,276
I know him well. I'll give him
24 hours to deliver.

660
01:13:27,363 --> 01:13:32,392
And tomorrow, we have one less worry.
- Man, my blessing goes with The Fist,

661
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:35,596
and may God be with him.

662
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:40,203
Girls! Hey!
- What do we do with Romeo Dolorosa?

663
01:13:40,685 --> 01:13:43,758
He's as dangerous as Dumas.

664
01:13:44,806 --> 01:13:47,605
Stop that thief! Call the police!

665
01:13:57,568 --> 01:14:00,606
Hi, pendejos. I hope you like it.

666
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:14,604
The idea of driving 1.000 Miles
with Estrellita makes me ill.

667
01:14:15,811 --> 01:14:20,044
What if I take Duane?
- He can take the car away from you.

668
01:14:20,492 --> 01:14:24,611
No. He'll come with me in the truck.
- What if I tie him up?

669
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:29,209
Bad idea. If anyone sees him,
we'll be fucked.

670
01:14:29,654 --> 01:14:32,771
So you'll do better with Estrellita.

671
01:14:39,656 --> 01:14:44,252
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I only tried it twice, you know,

672
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:48,290
once, in summer before starting Junior
High, I had one of my father's Larks.

673
01:14:48,457 --> 01:14:52,610
I only smoked half and I couldn't do
anymore because I started coughing.

674
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:01,771
The second one was at a party
at my sorority, you know,

675
01:15:01,819 --> 01:15:05,893
one of the student clubs that they
have. Mine was Kappa Gama Epsilon.

676
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:09,616
This time it was a lot better,
it was sweeter.

677
01:15:10,581 --> 01:15:13,573
Look, I know, I know,

678
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:17,615
I'm just talking, and you hate me.
You do hate me, right?

679
01:15:17,662 --> 01:15:21,702
I'm sorry. I'm so nervous,
I don't know what to do.

680
01:15:22,823 --> 01:15:26,817
I can't help it. Please,
are you ever going to talk to me?

681
01:15:27,344 --> 01:15:30,336
Listen, you little cunt. If you don't
stop breathing down my fucking neck

682
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:34,378
you won't make it
to he next gas station.

683
01:15:35,105 --> 01:15:37,097
Ok?

684
01:15:41,826 --> 01:15:45,820
My Dad used to sing this song to me
when I was a little boy.

685
01:15:46,467 --> 01:15:50,347
Are your parents dead?
- They're on vacation in Europe.

686
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:54,217
They won a trip on one of those
TV shows for couples.

687
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:04,303
Was it one of those shows where Mom
tells millions of people

688
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:08,230
how she does it with Dad?
- They did 8 shows!

689
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:12,225
I mean, it was the worst 2 months
of my entire life!

690
01:16:13,712 --> 01:16:16,624
Well, and now this.

691
01:16:17,112 --> 01:16:20,469
It's not so bad. You're still alive.

692
01:16:20,913 --> 01:16:25,908
Why are memories always so sad?
- Not always. Come on, I remember once,

693
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:30,828
when I was a kid someone brought
movies to Petit Caribe.

694
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:34,632
They showed them in my uncle's barn.

695
01:16:35,316 --> 01:16:39,389
There I saw Burt Lancaster for the
first time in the movie 'Veracruz'.

696
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,793
Saint Burt Lancaster, man!

697
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:08,311
He had about 108 giant gleaming teeth.

698
01:17:30,205 --> 01:17:34,199
Such a man I wanted to be combined
with the nobility of Gary Cooper.

699
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,680
It's a dramatic ending.
It's the perfect ending for a man.

700
01:17:46,088 --> 01:17:49,239
The true path to Sainthood.

701
01:17:50,049 --> 01:17:52,244
Yeah!

702
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:58,963
You're going to kill us when we get
to Las Vegas, aren't you?

703
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:03,004
Don't make plans. I hate people
who make plans, Duane.

704
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:07,971
Be best if we work things out
as we go along, amigo,

705
01:18:08,012 --> 01:18:11,971
don't you think?
- I would appreciate that.

706
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:29,335
I think we should stay on touch, sir.

707
01:18:31,262 --> 01:18:33,253
Sir?

708
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:20,044
What's this?

709
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,164
Junction to...

710
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:29,164
Las Vegas.

711
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:34,965
Come on! Come on!

712
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:50,653
Yeah, Doyle! What did you look at
the map with? Your fucking asshole?!

713
01:19:50,735 --> 01:19:53,728
They're going to Vegas. Las Vegas!

714
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:56,051
Hello? Hello?

715
01:19:56,176 --> 01:19:59,647
Piece of shit phone!

716
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:28,255
What's that strange sound?
Speak more slowly, sir.

717
01:20:28,342 --> 01:20:31,334
He's out of range.

718
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:48,937
Fuck you!

719
01:21:11,469 --> 01:21:15,463
This is your Captain Romeo Dolorosa
speaking. Welcome aboard.

720
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:19,504
Please fasten your seatbelts
and try to sleep.

721
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:22,822
Thank you very much. Fuck you!

722
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:26,951
Ok, guys. I hope to help out
with your little romance.

723
01:21:27,072 --> 01:21:29,951
Don't touch me, ok?
- Estelle.

724
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:34,032
Look, just fucking go fuck your
Mexican whore you like so much!

725
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:43,144
Come on, keep cool, Perdita.
Come on.

726
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:47,589
Never done it in a plane,
how about you?

727
01:21:59,678 --> 01:22:03,068
Pick a card.
- Go to sleep, Romeo.

728
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,192
We have a long night ahead us.
- Precisely. Don't you want to know

729
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:11,199
what's going to happen tomorrow?
- I nearly forgot that you're

730
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,553
a crazy Santero.
- Every Santero uses his power

731
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:19,674
to predict the future. Even those of
us who are crazy. Pick a card.

732
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:27,192
Luck. Plenty off luck.
Anyone wanna try?

733
01:22:27,683 --> 01:22:31,676
Come on, Duane.
The cards are sacred. They never lie.

734
01:22:32,163 --> 01:22:35,156
Ignore him, he's making fun of us.

735
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:39,604
They are 18 cards and only
one of them is really bad.

736
01:22:44,806 --> 01:22:48,799
But it's not this one.
You're still a lucky guy, man.

737
01:22:50,607 --> 01:22:53,804
And now it's my turn.

738
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:09,563
Sir, we've spotted a group that fits
their description. They're in

739
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:13,684
a rest-stop just outside of El Paso.
- Follow but do not intercept.

740
01:23:13,971 --> 01:23:17,964
If Dolorosa suspects anything
he's gonna kill those kids.

741
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:22,205
Call our people in Las Vegas. Tell
'em I want to find the warehouse

742
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:26,212
where they store those fetuses.
- That won't be easy, sir.

743
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:30,286
Start with all the cosmetic labs.
There can't be that many.

744
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:34,327
And tell them move their ass!
Hey, what's red and white

745
01:23:34,374 --> 01:23:38,368
and goes 60 Miles an hour?
A baby in a blender.

746
01:23:52,617 --> 01:23:55,610
Sons of bitches will never find her!

747
01:23:55,658 --> 01:23:59,014
What?
- Once they cross the border,

748
01:23:59,098 --> 01:24:02,614
they can't ask for any favors.
- What border?

749
01:24:02,699 --> 01:24:06,693
Mexican. I've to go after her myself.
Even if my wife thinks I'm crazy.

750
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,858
Sometimes it's better not to think so
much. Maybe you should read the paper.

751
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:15,019
No, no, no. That's no relief.

752
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:18,617
A man's gotta do what
his heart tells him to do.

753
01:24:18,702 --> 01:24:22,776
You understand what I mean?
You can't always be in control.

754
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:42,218
Did you see what I just did?
It wouldn't have happened

755
01:24:42,266 --> 01:24:45,623
if you'd been here. Think about it!

756
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:58,781
Some strange men came asking for you.

757
01:24:58,829 --> 01:25:01,821
We said nothing.

758
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:13,621
They said you owed Catalina money,

759
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:18,545
but I know they were lying
because I raised you

760
01:25:18,592 --> 01:25:22,632
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

761
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:41,229
I was not afraid, I have seen
so much, my grandson.

762
01:25:41,956 --> 01:25:45,996
Even invisible things.
When you were born I knew

763
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:50,077
you were special that when you died,
you'd turn into a jaguar

764
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:53,190
and run along Caribbean beaches.

765
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,599
Everything ok?
- This place is like

766
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:09,554
an elephant graveyard.
Why are you awake?

767
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:13,641
Something's burning you inside.
- It's nothing.

768
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:18,555
It's your little girlfriend.

769
01:26:18,643 --> 01:26:22,636
My head is ringing from 12 hours
of uninterrupted teenage bullshit.

770
01:26:24,244 --> 01:26:27,554
You're jealous. I like that.

771
01:26:38,646 --> 01:26:41,241
Hey! Hey! Wake up! Wake up!

772
01:26:41,287 --> 01:26:45,280
Come her! Come here! Look! Look!
So, it's our chance to escape.

773
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:49,281
If we find another way out of here,
they'll never find us.

774
01:26:49,368 --> 01:26:53,282
Estelle, you're crazy!
- Do you actually like that bitch?

775
01:26:53,449 --> 01:26:57,442
No, I'm trying to keep us alive.
- You're fucking coward!

776
01:26:57,489 --> 01:27:01,403
Second time you've called me that!
- Go ahead and hit me!

777
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:04,642
Deep down, you're just like them!

778
01:27:10,932 --> 01:27:12,650
Ok.

779
01:27:13,892 --> 01:27:15,884
Come on.

780
01:27:16,973 --> 01:27:19,885
I don't see them. Hurry up!

781
01:27:19,973 --> 01:27:21,805
Go!

782
01:27:23,774 --> 01:27:25,685
Go! Go! Go!

783
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:27,805
Fuck!

784
01:27:28,095 --> 01:27:30,165
Hurry up!

785
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:39,134
Go! They're behind us!

786
01:27:50,218 --> 01:27:52,733
Faster! Faster!

787
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:59,739
Faster! Faster!

788
01:28:15,783 --> 01:28:19,902
I thought you were stupid, but it
didn't think you were a traitor!

789
01:28:20,264 --> 01:28:24,257
I don't like traitors, Duane!
I don't like traitors! Understand?

790
01:28:25,665 --> 01:28:29,624
Shit, Duane, I trusted you!
I fucking trusted you,

791
01:28:29,665 --> 01:28:33,625
and this is how you repay me?
I'm going to fuck you over.

792
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:37,626
I'm gonna kill you, ok?
Do you wanna know how it's gonna end?

793
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:41,660
This is it, man! This is fucking it!
- Oh, God! No, no, no! Please!

794
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:45,667
It wasn't his fault! It was me!
It won't happen again. It was my idea!

795
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:48,667
Forget it, Romeo!
- You shut up!

796
01:28:48,749 --> 01:28:52,742
Perhaps we can use him in Las Vegas.
Come on, this could bring us bad luck.

797
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:56,823
How things changed! Before, you wanted
to shoot them in the desert,

798
01:28:56,870 --> 01:29:00,864
now you're defending them!
- Nobody wants to defend anybody, ok?

799
01:29:02,231 --> 01:29:06,225
This is not the right thing here, now.
- Now I'm the jealous one. Ok, Perdita?

800
01:29:06,272 --> 01:29:10,265
Estelle, what do you think?
Looks like they want to be alone.

801
01:29:10,312 --> 01:29:14,226
It wasn't his fault, it was me.
- Fucking asshole!

802
01:29:14,273 --> 01:29:18,267
You decide, Estelle, I finish him off
or I keep him alive to please Perdita.

803
01:29:18,314 --> 01:29:22,307
Forget it, Romeo! You're getting
out of hand. Let's get out of here.

804
01:29:24,515 --> 01:29:27,746
Stand up, gringo! Come on, Duane.

805
01:29:29,756 --> 01:29:33,749
How do you do it, man? Some day
you have to tell me your secret.

806
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:46,076
Understand? You don't beat!

807
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,076
Reggie, my friend. Come in.

808
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,232
Have a seat.

809
01:29:58,281 --> 01:30:02,069
You know why you're here?
- I think so, yes.

810
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:05,234
Is that a problem for you?

811
01:30:07,082 --> 01:30:11,076
Ok. I know you're raised up
together in one family.

812
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:15,197
It takes a pretty long time
when se left Petit Caribe.

813
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:19,237
I don't object your cousin.
But he did some ugly things.

814
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:25,083
Even the Mexican Government wants
him to get off.

815
01:30:28,566 --> 01:30:32,685
The Government is after my business.
Several of our associates are dead.

816
01:30:34,967 --> 01:30:38,961
Mr. Santos, if I only knew this...
- Don't excuse yourself.

817
01:30:39,008 --> 01:30:41,966
No one is accusing you
of doing anything.

818
01:30:42,008 --> 01:30:46,048
Romeo is doing me a favor
by driving the merchandise

819
01:30:46,089 --> 01:30:50,083
for which he'll be compensated.
When the delivery is secure

820
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,760
give him the money we agreed on.

821
01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:57,565
Then kill him.

822
01:30:58,011 --> 01:31:01,163
Money is no good to him, he's dead.

823
01:31:01,252 --> 01:31:04,244
So you take it
for doing me this favor.

824
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,763
That's most generous of you.
- Generous?

825
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,324
Just!

826
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:15,527
Treason is merely
a tool of resourcefulness.

827
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:20,691
I know this will be hard for you
but I firmly believe

828
01:31:20,735 --> 01:31:25,048
that man must live his life
according to his own terms

829
01:31:25,096 --> 01:31:29,089
or not live this life at all.
- I'm sure you are right, Mr. Santos.

830
01:31:30,737 --> 01:31:34,696
And I'm sure
you'll do a good job for me.

831
01:31:57,301 --> 01:32:01,295
I figure my little ladies are
wondering where I'm heading.

832
01:32:01,662 --> 01:32:05,622
I'll visit a friend in Nogales.
Estrellita, come with me.

833
01:32:05,703 --> 01:32:07,694
What for?

834
01:32:07,943 --> 01:32:11,778
I'm thinking of selling you.
Get in, pendejo.

835
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:15,693
Where the hell are you going?

836
01:32:19,025 --> 01:32:23,019
I'm going to dance with the devil
under the pale moonlight.

837
01:32:23,986 --> 01:32:27,980
Go fuck yourself, Romeo!
- What's wrong? It's from Batman.

838
01:32:28,027 --> 01:32:31,099
Fuck Batman!

839
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:50,583
One hit, one dollar! You want a hit?
You wanna hit, man?

840
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,709
Fuck, yeah!
- One dollar.

841
01:32:53,791 --> 01:32:57,751
Here's 10, kick my ass!
- Si, senor, for 10 dollars

842
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:01,705
I make your hair sizzle!
- That's a car battery!

843
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:05,627
Give it me, motherfucker!
- Very macho, man! Very macho!

844
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:09,627
Give it to me!
Give it to me, motherfucker!

845
01:33:14,635 --> 01:33:16,705
Oh, fuck!

846
01:33:17,955 --> 01:33:21,107
Electricity is cool, Estrellita.

847
01:33:54,321 --> 01:33:58,281
I'm looking for Catalina.
I heard he is here today.

848
01:33:58,322 --> 01:34:02,316
Catalina. About a debt.
- He's at the back.

849
01:34:29,568 --> 01:34:32,560
Romeo Dolorosa.

850
01:34:32,768 --> 01:34:36,728
Girls, I want you to meet
a real bandido.

851
01:34:36,809 --> 01:34:40,279
Ladies.
- We heard you were doing a job for

852
01:34:40,329 --> 01:34:44,323
Santos with your cousin Reggie.
- Fuck! You keep yourself informed.

853
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:49,524
You have to keep up with everything
in this business. When you don't know

854
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:53,565
what's happening, you're dead!
- Listen, Catalina, I'm here

855
01:34:53,612 --> 01:34:56,888
to settle my debt.
I don't like owing anyone anything.

856
01:34:56,932 --> 01:34:59,811
Well, you know that.

857
01:34:59,933 --> 01:35:02,811
Did you hear that, girls?

858
01:35:02,933 --> 01:35:06,927
The son of a bitch says
he doesn't like owing money to anyone.

859
01:35:06,974 --> 01:35:10,285
So you came here to pay me?

860
01:35:11,015 --> 01:35:14,291
Sure. Yeah. And this is half.

861
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:19,369
I'll give you the other half
somewhere were we can talk.

862
01:35:20,336 --> 01:35:24,125
Where did you find this beauty?

863
01:35:24,337 --> 01:35:28,331
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. She's the other half.

864
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:35,977
Come to my office.

865
01:35:36,019 --> 01:35:39,012
You too, sweetie.

866
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,332
Stay here! Stay here, girls!

867
01:35:52,062 --> 01:35:55,020
I don't want any.
- How come? It's pure. Good stuff.

868
01:35:55,062 --> 01:35:59,022
Come on, Catalina, she's not one
of those girls. She hasn't tried

869
01:35:59,063 --> 01:36:03,057
anything stronger than a diet Coke!
- Bullshit, Romeo. Gimme that!

870
01:36:03,104 --> 01:36:06,141
She's terrific. Innocent, clean.

871
01:36:06,944 --> 01:36:09,937
And her pussy's pure gold, man!

872
01:36:10,985 --> 01:36:14,945
You'll make triple what you make
with those dried-up cunts.

873
01:36:14,986 --> 01:36:18,980
Where did you get her?
- Well, does it matter? We got a deal?

874
01:36:19,987 --> 01:36:23,980
What are you talking about?
- Estrellita, Estrellita,

875
01:36:24,027 --> 01:36:28,021
now this man owns you, ok?
And please don't make me look bad.

876
01:36:28,068 --> 01:36:31,982
You can't be serious.
- You're right. She's great!

877
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,823
Let's toast.
- I hear you visited Petit Caribe?

878
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:40,749
No, no, no. I had no time.
I sent my associates.

879
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:44,301
They did a good job.

880
01:36:44,991 --> 01:36:48,985
See, I don't like being owed money.
But you learned your lesson now.

881
01:36:49,032 --> 01:36:53,025
You're all paid up. That's it.
Everything is forgotten.

882
01:36:53,753 --> 01:36:57,712
No, Catalina, it's not forgotten.
- Then why the fuck did you come here?

883
01:36:57,753 --> 01:37:00,905
To kill you, pendejo!

884
01:37:40,241 --> 01:37:43,233
I'm dead so are you.

885
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:47,715
Santos will kill you.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

886
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:52,356
Your cousin sold you out,
you sick fuck! Everyone knows it.

887
01:37:53,363 --> 01:37:56,355
You're lying!
- Reggie's gonna kill you

888
01:37:56,403 --> 01:38:00,397
after you make the delivery.
I'll be waiting for you in hell.

889
01:38:01,924 --> 01:38:05,156
We'll have a great time there.

890
01:38:10,526 --> 01:38:13,757
See you later, amigo.

891
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:30,520
Remember,

892
01:38:30,569 --> 01:38:34,563
whatever happens, keep smiling, ok.
No long faces. Right?

893
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:37,848
Nothing happened in here, ok?

894
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:31,777
Dance! Dance!

895
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,171
Dance!

896
01:39:43,942 --> 01:39:47,777
Holy shit! He wasted him!
Son of a bitch!

897
01:40:01,505 --> 01:40:05,499
You saved my life
back at the airplane junkyard.

898
01:40:09,306 --> 01:40:10,945
Thank you.

899
01:40:10,987 --> 01:40:14,980
Don't thank me.
Maybe what awaits you could be worse.

900
01:40:16,388 --> 01:40:20,381
I bet sometimes...
you wish you never met him.

901
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:22,148
Who?

902
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:24,180
Romeo.

903
01:40:24,869 --> 01:40:29,546
Listen. There's a lot of people in my
fucking life that I wish I never met

904
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:33,584
but Romeo is definitely
not one of them, ok?

905
01:40:35,031 --> 01:40:39,025
You ever think about an animal
eating you alive?

906
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:43,785
I thought Romeo was going to kill me.
- I'm not talking about that.

907
01:40:44,633 --> 01:40:48,626
I'm talking about a wild animal
grabbing you an ripping you apart.

908
01:40:50,914 --> 01:40:54,907
I don't think of things like that.
- That's why you're so boring.

909
01:40:56,955 --> 01:41:00,948
Strangest people come up with
the most interesting ideas, Duane.

910
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:05,266
I've never met anybody like you.
- I know.

911
01:41:08,917 --> 01:41:12,273
Let's go! Let's go!

912
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:19,238
Why do you follow Romeo? Why don't
you just take off and leave him?

913
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:23,272
Why don't you just shut up, please?
- Are you in love with him?

914
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,111
In love?

915
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:33,120
You sound like a fucking
Judith Krantz novel.

916
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:37,395
I'm just waiting for my money
and then I'll be gone.

917
01:41:37,802 --> 01:41:41,272
There won't be any money,
it's a trap.

918
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:44,794
What the fuck are you talking about?!

919
01:41:44,883 --> 01:41:48,877
I know there's someone named Santos
who wants to kill Romeo in Las Vegas.

920
01:41:48,964 --> 01:41:52,957
A Mexican man told him before dying.
- Don't fuck with me!

921
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:57,800
What the fuck are you saying?

922
01:41:57,925 --> 01:42:00,918
It's the truth.

923
01:42:02,846 --> 01:42:06,920
What? No, no, no. Forget the cops.
They know less than you and me!

924
01:42:10,407 --> 01:42:13,400
Don't cry, sweetie.

925
01:42:13,448 --> 01:42:17,920
How would you feel if I started crying
instead of going out looking for her?

926
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:25,806
Estelle?!

927
01:42:35,852 --> 01:42:39,845
You cannot escape me!
You will be my love slave forever.

928
01:42:44,813 --> 01:42:48,807
Turn it off. All that jumping
is making me nervous.

929
01:42:48,894 --> 01:42:52,854
They jump so much because they have
super powers. Don't you understand?

930
01:42:52,895 --> 01:42:55,807
Here. Cocksuckers!

931
01:42:55,895 --> 01:42:58,968
Who the fuck is that!

932
01:43:00,296 --> 01:43:04,370
They said you grew another arm from
drinking so much Tequila, cabron!

933
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:06,365
Fucking Romeo!

934
01:43:06,417 --> 01:43:10,206
It's been a long time, man!
- A long time.

935
01:43:11,658 --> 01:43:15,811
You came here? You need something.
- I do need your help like always, guy.

936
01:43:17,019 --> 01:43:21,013
I want you to meet my friends.
The poor little Duane.

937
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:25,053
My sad princess Estelle and that's
Perdita Durango.

938
01:43:28,261 --> 01:43:32,255
In the last 48 hours, I've had
2 near-death accidents.

939
01:43:32,822 --> 01:43:37,498
Mexican Mafia tried to shoot at me.
Some fucking animal tried to rip

940
01:43:37,542 --> 01:43:41,536
my fucking head off and I haven't
had breakfast yet.

941
01:43:41,823 --> 01:43:45,817
Please, don't fuck with me today, ok?
All right? Just do you job.

942
01:43:48,504 --> 01:43:52,817
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid to listen
to other people's problems. Hm?

943
01:43:53,745 --> 01:43:58,262
No, you're right! But you are getting
paid to listen to my fucking problems

944
01:43:58,306 --> 01:44:02,300
'cause I'm your boss and I own you,
you little shit! So do your job!

945
01:44:02,387 --> 01:44:06,380
Oh, please, I'm so sorry. We're both
very tired, you understand

946
01:44:06,427 --> 01:44:10,421
I'm also tired! I haven't been shot
at but I've had 2 consecutive shifts

947
01:44:10,468 --> 01:44:14,462
sitting in front of the fucking
computer and I wanna go home to sleep!

948
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:20,143
Yes. Yes, but first...
- There it is!

949
01:44:20,190 --> 01:44:24,184
That's the same fucking list!
- I told you.

950
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:28,190
Practically every company has some
type of problems with the law.

951
01:44:28,231 --> 01:44:32,225
Fines, toxins, illegal animal trade.
Yes, rhinoceros horns, dog fat...

952
01:44:33,072 --> 01:44:37,066
Shut up with the fucking animals!
Look at this! They're in Tucson

953
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:41,106
and they're gonna be here in
4 hours... And we have nothing!

954
01:44:41,153 --> 01:44:44,430
Dick! Shit! Nothing!
- I'm sorry.

955
01:44:49,315 --> 01:44:53,309
Ok. Print all the companies that
don't have any violations.

956
01:44:57,476 --> 01:44:58,796
What?

957
01:44:58,837 --> 01:45:02,830
All the companies that don't have
any violations, that are clear. Print!

958
01:45:04,277 --> 01:45:08,237
3 and one of them is still
under construction.

959
01:45:15,599 --> 01:45:19,593
Estelle, what's gotten into you?
- Forgive me for calling you a coward.

960
01:45:22,201 --> 01:45:25,830
Forget it.
- It was to get you to react.

961
01:45:29,202 --> 01:45:32,239
It's ok. Really.

962
01:45:35,323 --> 01:45:39,317
Estelle, they can see us.
- Great, let them see!

963
01:45:39,964 --> 01:45:43,240
Oh, my God!

964
01:45:46,685 --> 01:45:49,916
I can't believe it.
- Come on, Duane.

965
01:45:50,726 --> 01:45:52,398
Estelle. My God!

966
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:56,325
This might be our last chance
to do it.

967
01:46:05,968 --> 01:46:09,928
Anything wrong?
- No, everything is just dandy.

968
01:46:26,252 --> 01:46:29,210
Did I miss anything?
- Life's a bitch, huh?

969
01:46:29,252 --> 01:46:33,166
That guy just
got hit by a car across the street.

970
01:46:33,373 --> 01:46:37,367
You lose sight for a second...
- Death came as a surprise to him.

971
01:46:38,694 --> 01:46:42,688
There'll be many more surprises
when we arrive to that place.

972
01:46:42,735 --> 01:46:45,932
Well, I don't like surprises.

973
01:46:51,136 --> 01:46:54,334
Hey, you! Everything is ready.

974
01:46:59,177 --> 01:47:02,932
I don't think this is a good idea.
- Don't worry.

975
01:47:03,218 --> 01:47:07,212
They're good people, good friends
of mine. Doug was in Beirut with me.

976
01:47:07,259 --> 01:47:11,172
What did he do, leave his arm there?
- Very funny, Perdita.

977
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:15,219
I crossed the battlefield with that
arm. It took me hours to get it

978
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:19,254
to the hospital. I got there too late,
though. It rotted.

979
01:47:21,261 --> 01:47:24,254
Take me with you. Come on!

980
01:47:24,302 --> 01:47:26,896
He only has one fucking arm!

981
01:47:26,942 --> 01:47:28,421
No.

982
01:47:28,462 --> 01:47:32,422
Someone has to take care of
the kids. I don't trust Lilly

983
01:47:32,463 --> 01:47:36,457
and Doug is an ex-marine.
- Don't fuck with me, ok?

984
01:47:36,504 --> 01:47:40,703
I don't want you coming, period.
Is that good enough?

985
01:47:40,945 --> 01:47:44,824
A piece of cake, Perdita. Drop the
merchandise, pick up the money,

986
01:47:44,865 --> 01:47:48,859
and that's it. We'll be back before
you notice we're gone.

987
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:15,821
I don't like
leaving things half done.

988
01:48:15,911 --> 01:48:19,824
I don't want to make my cousin
look bad.

989
01:48:20,952 --> 01:48:23,466
Your cousin?

990
01:48:33,354 --> 01:48:35,345
Fuck!

991
01:48:55,678 --> 01:48:58,875
I wanted to fuck you one more time...

992
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,350
Romeo left these for you.

993
01:49:12,881 --> 01:49:16,078
Where are the keys?
- What keys?

994
01:49:16,121 --> 01:49:19,034
For the handcuffs.
- I have them.

995
01:49:19,082 --> 01:49:21,073
Give 'em to me.

996
01:49:21,122 --> 01:49:25,116
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
My husband said

997
01:49:25,163 --> 01:49:29,076
no one leaves until
he or Romeo return.

998
01:49:29,483 --> 01:49:31,475
Ok.

999
01:49:33,444 --> 01:49:35,878
Pick a card.
- What's this? A game?

1000
01:49:37,165 --> 01:49:40,157
It's your future.

1001
01:49:42,526 --> 01:49:46,280
What does it mean?
- Bad luck.

1002
01:49:49,127 --> 01:49:49,798
Shit!

1003
01:49:49,847 --> 01:49:53,682
Where are we going now?
- Our little trip is over.

1004
01:49:53,728 --> 01:49:57,687
You're letting us go?
- That's right. I can't be driving you

1005
01:49:57,728 --> 01:50:01,722
around all the time, huh?
- You're going after him, aren't you?

1006
01:50:02,169 --> 01:50:06,163
It's your lucky day, sweetheart. Don't
blow it by asking stupid questions.

1007
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:09,722
Now go! Go!

1008
01:50:11,811 --> 01:50:14,723
Bye, Perdita.

1009
01:50:36,015 --> 01:50:40,089
Doyle, I fucking hate you!
I hate your little TV

1010
01:50:40,136 --> 01:50:44,129
and I hate your glasses
and I hate your stupid fucking tie!

1011
01:50:45,497 --> 01:50:49,376
Did you say something, Sir?
- No, nothing.

1012
01:50:49,497 --> 01:50:53,286
Do you see anything?
- Not a thing, sir.

1013
01:50:53,378 --> 01:50:56,450
Everything's quiet, nothing's moved.

1014
01:50:57,299 --> 01:51:01,258
Motherfucker, you're not gonna have
this job much longer 'cause I'm gonna

1015
01:51:01,299 --> 01:51:05,259
tell 'em put you back in uniform and
right back out on the street.

1016
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:09,260
As a matter of fact, when I get
through with you, you will guard

1017
01:51:09,301 --> 01:51:13,340
little shopping malls and put the
shopping carts back where they belong.

1018
01:51:39,506 --> 01:51:43,500
It's here! The truck! It's here!
- What the heck are you doing?

1019
01:51:44,827 --> 01:51:48,820
Right... Call the station.
And tell them I was right.

1020
01:51:49,228 --> 01:51:52,300
Right away, Sir.

1021
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:04,301
Fuck it!

1022
01:52:43,397 --> 01:52:45,388
Shit!

1023
01:52:46,678 --> 01:52:49,670
Bayou Chemical Industries.

1024
01:52:49,718 --> 01:52:53,712
Just opposite the Lock Shop
on Nevada Boulevard.

1025
01:52:54,679 --> 01:52:58,639
It's ok, Woody, all on their way.
All the units are on their way.

1026
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:02,673
Shut up! And don't call me Woody!
'Cause I can't fucking stand it!

1027
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,111
You understand? Don't call me Woody!

1028
01:53:17,683 --> 01:53:21,518
Hey, cousin.
- Hey, man. You've brought our pal.

1029
01:53:21,684 --> 01:53:25,518
Hi, Doug.
- You haven't changed.

1030
01:53:27,245 --> 01:53:31,318
Nothing's changed. Right, Reggie?
- Like always, us three.

1031
01:53:33,486 --> 01:53:36,762
Here's the money. Take it.

1032
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:41,757
Count it.

1033
01:53:41,847 --> 01:53:44,521
I trust you.

1034
01:53:47,648 --> 01:53:49,639
Shit!

1035
01:54:29,015 --> 01:54:30,448
Fuck!

1036
01:55:03,941 --> 01:55:05,534
Reggie,

1037
01:55:07,342 --> 01:55:11,336
I love you, Reggie.
Why are you doing this to me?

1038
01:55:11,423 --> 01:55:14,938
We are no longer in Petit Caribe,
Romeo.

1039
01:55:15,823 --> 01:55:19,533
I know.
- There's no other way out, man.

1040
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:23,453
It's either you or me. What do you
ant me to do?

1041
01:55:23,545 --> 01:55:27,458
There's always another way out,
Reggie.

1042
01:55:34,827 --> 01:55:38,024
Look at me!

1043
01:55:38,627 --> 01:55:42,018
Look at me!

1044
01:56:02,191 --> 01:56:04,262
Oh, Romeo...

1045
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:07,062
Romeo!

1046
01:56:23,115 --> 01:56:25,549
Hold it!
- Nobody move!

1047
01:57:08,963 --> 01:57:11,955
He's dead.
- Golly gee Mothercrist!

1048
01:57:12,043 --> 01:57:15,036
Look at his teeth!

01:57:18,325 --> 01:57:20,441
Incredible!

1050
01:57:43,169 --> 01:57:45,967
What happend?

1051
01:58:34,538 --> 01:58:36,529
I'm tired.

1052
01:58:40,819 --> 01:58:43,572
I'm so weak.

1053
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:49,212
And I'm lonely.

1054
01:58:52,461 --> 01:58:56,056
I hurt so much.
I feel it hard to explain.

1055
01:59:00,182 --> 01:59:03,300
I can't trust love.

1056
01:59:03,383 --> 01:59:06,534
Because it won't stay the same.

1057
01:59:07,383 --> 01:59:09,978
Wow! Tired!

1058
01:59:11,664 --> 01:59:14,975
I'm so weak.

1059
01:59:15,705 --> 01:59:18,981
And I'm lonely.

1060
01:59:39,629 --> 01:59:42,986
I need somebody...

1061
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,091
