2
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,491
Want another? Sweetie!

3
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,817
Bring me another Bud. And for you?
- What would you like?

4
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,614
Coke.
- Diet?

5
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,813
You fuckin' kidding?

6
00:01:30,902 --> 00:01:33,860
You live in Mexico?
- Not exactly.

7
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:38,499
Hey, you heading out somewhere?
- Nowhere now. What about yourself?

8
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:42,378
Phoenix. 4 day software convention.

9
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:45,222
I'm a software salesman.

10
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:49,781
By the way, my name is Manny Flynn.
Half Jewish, half Irish.

11
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:53,540
What's yours?
- Perdita Durango.

12
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,545
Ah, that's a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman. Married?

13
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,777
Listen, Manny,

14
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:08,822
you want me to go to Phoenix with you?
You pay me way, you buy my meals.

15
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,061
I'll keep your dick
hard for 4 straight days.

16
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:16,340
While you're at the convention,
I'll do a little business myself.

17
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,383
Plenty of guys there, right?
I show some tit, milk a little cow.

18
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,386
Quick and clean. 50 bucks a pop.

19
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,424
I'll let you keep half of the profit.
How about it?

20
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,623
I gotta go.

21
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,543
Asshole!

22
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,825
Hands up! Hands up!

23
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:55,630
You're sisters?

24
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:01,069
Well, I had a sister, too.
Her name was Juana.

25
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:06,390
She had two little girls
that looked just like you.

26
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:10,191
You wanna see my sister? Yeah?

27
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:13,230
Open it.

28
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:23,552
That's my sister.
Her husband shot and killed her.

29
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,352
And then he took his gun

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,868
pointed to one

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,312
and then the other little girl
and he shot them both in the head.

32
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,796
Bang! Bang!

33
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,757
Thank you.

34
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,608
I need a drink.

35
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,053
Please stay behind the line
until you are called forward.

36
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:13,780
All citizens entering the
United States with goods to declare

37
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:16,784
please move to the red corridor.

38
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:20,820
Remain in your vehicle until
interviewed by an Officer.

39
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:14,704
Forget it.
- My little virgin,

40
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:18,714
I think today is my lucky day.
- But not mine.

41
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:22,715
Lo siento, but I'm in a
bad mood today.

42
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:28,430
Come on, everybody needs somebody.
Even woman like you, Srta. Spitfire.

43
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:34,707
My name is Romeo Dolorosa.
My grandma is a witch,

44
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:38,752
my father was a Spaniard,
and I have a Mexican ranch.

45
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,073
Do you wanna come with me?

46
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,753
Well, my name is Perdita Durango

47
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:48,759
and I don't know shit about my fucking
parents and I don't wanna know shit

48
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,794
about your fucking little ranch.

49
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:00,355
You remind me of someone.
- Yeah? Who, Doris Day?

50
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:05,596
Let me guess.
You're from Hollywood, right?

51
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:09,676
Probably think you can turn me
into a big star?

52
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:14,161
But by the way you're dressed,
you remind me more of a faggot

53
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:18,278
or an extra in a bad Black
Sabbath video.

54
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:22,394
I like it.

55
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:26,234
Well, the truth is, I'm a scientist.
- A scientist?

56
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:29,198
No, you're definitely a dentist.

57
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:32,882
I could tell from that stupid smile
on your face.

58
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:36,887
It's the truth. Science is everything.
Scientists need money,

59
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:41,683
like everyone else. They need funds
to continue their research.

60
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:45,762
So, that's why I'm here
on this side of the border.

61
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,848
I see. Well, you're looking to the
wrong person for a donation. So...

62
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,280
Don't worry.
We have plenty of donations.

63
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,363
Like 12.000 dollars I just received

64
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,845
this morning
from the Morgens Interstate Bank.

65
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:02,885
Keep quiet! Fucking hell!
I don't want one fucking move!

66
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:07,005
Don't move! Don't fucking move!
- Shut up!

67
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,166
If you keep quiet, nothing's
gonna happen, alright?

68
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,887
The money! Quick! Here!

69
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:22,688
Take off your shirt.
Come on, take off your shirt!

70
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:26,810
What the fuck are you doing, man?!
You're crazy!

71
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:29,848
Come on, show me your titties.
Keep going...

72
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:33,889
The bra... Come on, the bra! The bra!
- What the fuck you doing, man?!

73
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:37,845
It's not the time!
- Oh, Good Lord!

74
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:41,569
Come here!
- Do you hear me? Let's go! Shit!

75
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:45,293
Sweet mother of God!
Move! Move! Move!

76
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:57,213
Come on, Romeo! Are you nuts, or what?
Run! Fuck you!

77
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,613
Santero psychopath!

78
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:20,182
Ok, thank you very much.
Here you go, the mask of El Santo.

79
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,819
It will bring you good luck.
Thank you very much.

80
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:27,858
You had to do it your way!
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

81
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:32,224
It's the last time I'm working
with you, Cabron! Fucking clown!

82
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:36,785
Piece of shit, Santero. He had
to wear that fuckin' little mask,

83
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:40,422
you know, like El Santo.

84
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:45,346
Hey, man, how much did we get?
- I don't know, man! I don't know.

85
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:49,347
Maybe 20.000, maybe more.
- I hope it's more. At least 25.

86
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:53,347
One grand for each and the rest for
the mother-fucking Catalina!

87
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:57,780
Forget about Catalina, Cabron.
- It's scary, man! I'm scared shitless!

88
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,899
Last week, we owed him 20 grand,
and now it's 23!

89
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,303
If we don't pay him soon, he'll kill
us and make a belt with our nipples!

90
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:14,231
Y eso no es funny, no senor.
We shouldn't have borrowed

91
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:17,901
money from him, I told you,
I told... Romeo?

92
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,543
Romeo!

93
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,304
Fuck!

94
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:31,587
Holy fucking shit!
I'll get you, man! I'll get you!

95
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:45,627
Your luck is running out today, uh?
- Trust science, Perdita.

96
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:49,636
I have different plans of my own.
I get out of here. I'll donate my body

97
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:53,227
to science when I'm dead.
- You don't have to.

98
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:57,311
I already took care of that. Look.
- Are you fucking crazy?

99
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:00,871
C'mon trust in my science, Perdita.

100
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,071
Do you want to cross the border
with me?

101
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,153
So what the fuck are you?
A grave-robber or a bank-robber?

102
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:15,594
I do it all, my love.
I got a really busy schedule today.

103
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:38,713
Your papers, please.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,722
Anything to declare?
- Nothing, Officer.

105
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,163
All right. You may continue.
- Thank you.

106
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:22,725
Trust in science, Perdita.
Trust in science.

107
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:26,925
I come from the island Petit Caribe,
3 Miles long, 1 Mile wide.

108
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:31,531
When I was a kid, there were only
2 cars. And one day, of course,

109
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:33,928
they crashed.

110
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,732
Sooner or later,
it was bound to happen.

111
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:44,769
It was impossible for it not
to happen. That's how the world turns.

112
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:49,329
That's how you and I met, Perdita.

113
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:31,731
You'll be my Yalocha...
- What?

114
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:35,333
My High Priestess.

115
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:39,894
You can help me with the ritual.
Last night I dreamt about it,

116
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:43,619
I dreamt I was licking your body.

117
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,814
Stop! Stop!

118
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,737
Did I do this?

119
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,218
What the fuck are you talking about?!

120
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:59,259
I'm a sorcerer, Perdita.
Your Babalou.

121
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:03,540
It's rule of Ocha.
Santeria, my science.

122
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:07,941
Don't talk shit o me. You don't
believe in those things, do you?

123
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:12,820
I do believe in its power.

124
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:16,943
You want to see it or are you scared?

125
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,255
I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Why not? It scares evil spirits away.

126
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:51,340
I don't believe in voodoo bullshit.
I doubt if those people did either.

127
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:55,262
It's not voodoo. It's Santeria.
It's not the same.

128
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,415
Little magical tricks.
Latin bullshit.

129
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:02,457
But it works. You saw it.
- Yeah, but for how long?

130
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:05,701
You know, people are not that stupid.
- Yeah,

131
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,862
do you have a better idea, smartass?

132
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,256
Yeah,

133
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:16,457
you know what?

134
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,776
We should kill someone.
- What?

135
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:26,300
Yeah, we should kill them
and then we should eat them.

136
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:33,742
Fuck! Like animals, mi amor?
- That's right.

137
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:38,868
It'll be ingrained
in their brains forever.

138
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,582
Let's do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow is not good.

139
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,385
I have a date across the border.
- A date?

140
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:56,830
Son of a bitch.
- It's not what you think.

141
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:59,791
It's business.

142
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:08,304
Being a kid in Caribe, I spent every
day in the port with my cousin Reggie.

143
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:12,394
There were huge ships, everyone going
to different places.

144
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:17,673
Panama, Mexico, Hong Kong, Lisboa.
Places that we couldn't imagine.

145
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,669
From the moment, I knew I would go
far into the world, beyond Caribe.

146
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,149
Yeah? What went wrong?
- What do you mean?

147
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:31,156
This isn't exactly Paris, sweetheart.
- Fuck you!

148
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:35,671
Fuck! I lived in Paris for 2 years,
mademoiselle, and 4 years in Madrid.

149
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:39,475
You know Madrid? Look at this...
Mira, mira. Esto...

150
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,398
I got this from a bull.
I was a bullfighter.

151
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,671
And this is fuckin' souvenir
from Beirut. The Marines!

152
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,713
The greatest travel agency
in this fuckin' wide world.

153
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:58,400
What are you thinking in that
little head of yours?

154
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:03,673
I'm thinking,

155
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:07,716
that if we're gonna do a kidnapping,
we should get a gringo.

156
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:10,961
A guero?
- It'll be impressive.

157
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:16,399
Adolfo, did you hear that?
- Killing gueros?

158
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:21,598
Fucking hell! Living with you
will be kickass!

159
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:38,286
(Song) Who can turn the world on
with her smile?

160
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:41,604
Coming! Coming! I'm coming!

161
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,001
Hello, Mrs. Satisfy.

162
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,599
Is Estelle here?
- Of course she is.

163
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,370
Come on in. Come on in. Estelle?

164
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:59,563
Estelle, honey, Duane's here.

165
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,327
Oh, please don't make him wait.
Now, come on down!

166
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:06,728
Hello, Mr. Satisfy.
- Hi.

167
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:11,323
I'll be down in a second.

168
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:20,488
Estelle! Don't you hear me?
Come down!

169
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:24,688
What is Duane gonna think
of us? Oh, she is the worst!

170
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,289
Duane,

171
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:32,329
in this world, you have to be
in control.

172
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:36,370
It's the only thing that
makes us different from the animals.

173
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:40,376
Absolutely, Mr. Satisfy.
- Ah, you can call me Herb.

174
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:44,536
You know, when we were dating,
Glory Ann always called me Herb

175
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:48,492
after Herb Alpert, the musician.
You know?

176
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:56,453
The Tijuana Brass, you heard of them,
right?

177
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,611
Well,

178
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,938
not really...
- What is that?

179
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:05,974
It's a free-form mobile, representing
the 4 basic food groups...

180
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:09,253
Here they come.
- Ta-ta-ta-ta!

181
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:12,055
Here she is!

182
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,579
You look beautiful.
- Ok, you two kids.

183
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:19,616
Go out now and have a good time.
- Estelle said you're heading to Susie?

184
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:24,417
Ah, that's where the young ones go
to have fun nowadays?

185
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,143
Yeah, well...
- Let's go, Duane, otherwise

186
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:32,178
we might never get out of here.
- Duane, remember what I told you.

187
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:36,976
(Together) Always be in control!

188
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,540
They haven't arrived yet.

189
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:59,980
No. Where is Perdita?
- Shopping.

190
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:43,995
My, God! Are you alright, Sir?
I could've killed you!

191
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:47,825
Call an ambulance! Call for help!

192
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:51,114
Alright, alright, alright!

193
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,633
Please, stop touching me!
Stop touching me!

194
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:58,710
Shit!

195
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,831
Excuse me, Sir...

196
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:19,832
It's the Holy Bible.

197
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:34,037
You also have a letter.
Is it a secret admirer?

198
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:39,924
Oh, my God! Is my number one fan.
Is my grandmother Maria Jose, man!

199
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:44,439
I love her! I love that woman.
She always writes o me, man.

200
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:48,641
The oldest woman in Petit Caribe.
I mean, no one knows how old she is.

201
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:52,680
Whatever happened in my country,
she was there to tell the story.

202
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:56,720
She can't write, so she dictates her
letters to my cousin Danny Mestiza.

203
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:59,441
Even when my cousin Reggie and I were
in Beirut, she sent me a letter.

204
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:03,528
We got the money you sent.
Danny says thanks, and so do I.

205
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:10,723
I'm reading the Bible, looking for
the place where you're fighting.

206
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,842
Have you seen the Garden of Eden?

207
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:42,853
Did you see it?
- What, man?

208
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,927
The Garden of Eden.

209
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:50,009
Of course! Fuck, Adolfo, of course,
man! That's when I saw the Devil.

210
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,769
Garlic sprouted everywhere
he stepped.

211
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:03,890
There they are. Stay put.

212
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:06,009
Wait.

213
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:28,454
Primo!
- Reggie, man!

214
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,899
Hey, man! I missed you, asshole!

215
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:37,853
As elegant as ever. How's business?

216
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:42,058
I get by...
- That's over, man, that's over!

217
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:45,853
We're too big for this fucking border.

218
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:50,218
I'm changing your luck, Romeo.
You know Marcelo Santos?

219
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:55,299
Crazy Eyes Santos?
- Don't ever call him that!

220
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:59,379
He hates it. It pisses him off.
- Are you working for him now?

221
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,380
I told you, man, big business.
Big business!

222
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:07,859
Listen. You're my brother. My brother.

223
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:12,858
Mr. Santos wants to meet you.

224
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:18,022
He's here?
- In the car.

225
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,749
Mr. Dolorosa.
You like the jabugo ham?

226
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:37,427
It's illegal but delicious.
- Thanks. It's a pleasure

227
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:41,432
meeting you, Mr. Santos.
- I know it's a strange place to meet,

228
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:45,466
but I'm on my way to another business
meeting, and I hate to fly. Drink?

229
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:48,505
Yeah, thanks.

230
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:51,546
Your cousin Reggie,
he speaks very highly of you.

231
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:55,588
He tells me you send money back home
to your family. I like that.

232
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:01,272
Well, Reggie and I are very tight,

233
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:05,025
but he might have exaggerated
a little, Mr. Santos.

234
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,468
You don't have to be humble with me.
I need someone like you by my side.

235
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:14,191
Here's my proposal. It's very simple.
In 48 hours, a truck will arrive.

236
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:19,072
A refrigerated, semi-trailer truck
loaded with human embryos

237
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,671
for the cosmetic industries.

238
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,119
You make a skin cream with fetuses?
- Not a bad idea, although it's not

239
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,233
originally mine. You see, the Nazis
made bars of soap out of the Jews.

240
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:37,831
Yeah, and you adapted it to our times?
- More or less. People want to be

241
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:41,841
so beautiful nowadays, hu? You have
to give them that they want.

242
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:46,001
Sure, everyone wants to look younger.
- Anyway, we must get this shipment to

243
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:50,036
a secret lab in Las Vegas right away.
- Right. You want me to go with Reggie?

244
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,156
No, I have other plans for him.

245
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:57,197
They tell me that you know the area.
Can you do it?

246
00:29:57,765 --> 00:30:00,996
Certainly, Mr. Santos.
I'm glad to help.

247
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:04,880
Muy bueno. Now I have 10.000 dollars
for you in old bills.

248
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:10,080
The driver will have an envelope
with your instructions.

249
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:14,206
When you arrive safely in Las Vegas,
your cousin Reggie will give you

250
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:19,276
another 10.000 dollars. You remember
always, that God and I are with you.

251
00:30:44,332 --> 00:30:48,484
Hey, chica! Looking for someone?
- Where the hell did you get that?

252
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:52,090
I took it from a kid. Get in.
Get in!

253
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:03,688
Ow! You are a clown, you know that?
- A clown with a golden dick.

254
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,845
Right.

255
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:10,051
Look, preciosa, look.

256
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:18,290
Yes! You little devil, you!
So your date was with a bank?

257
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:22,331
No, something better. We have to go
on vacation, isn't that great?

258
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:26,611
And when we get there, there'll be
another package like this. Give me!

259
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:34,538
Sounds like a good plan.
- Yes. We'll leave tomorrow night.

260
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:39,017
We've enough time for our little show.
Adolfo is getting ready everything.

261
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,340
I thought with everything that's
going on, I thought you would probably

262
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:47,215
forget about that Santero.
- Forget about it? Are you crazy?

263
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:51,295
It's the only thing I can think about.
Now more than ever. We need a good

264
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,256
sacrifice to appease the gods.
- Well, this is the perfect place.

265
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:59,336
There's nothing but little fuckin'
lambs walking around here.

266
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:05,098
We just have to think about doing it.
- It's easy. Just stop someone and say:

267
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:09,178
I'm Palo Mayombe High Priestess.
Mind if I cut your throat and eat

268
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:13,298
your heart? Ok, what should we get?

269
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,416
I don't know.

270
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:20,466
How about something blond, tanned,

271
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:22,498
muscular?

272
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:25,984
Are you gonna fuck him or eat him?

273
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,985
Maybe both.
- Ok.

274
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,305
Here's your man.
- He's no good.

275
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:08,188
What do you mean he's no good?
- From far away he looked different.

276
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:12,193
Esta fuckin' borracho! I hate drunks.
- What do I do with him now?

277
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:16,308
I don't know. Why don't you lave him
where you found him?

278
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:19,388
Who the hell are you people?

279
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:22,508
You crazy bitch!

280
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:25,834
Sorry, man. Who understands women?

281
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:30,110
What are you doing?
- Watch, wait and see.

282
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,352
Shut up! Shut up!
Fucking blow your heads off!

283
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:47,832
Come on! Come on!

284
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:10,596
They're gonna kill the kids! They're
the devils! I saw it in their eyes!

285
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:15,637
They're gonna eat them and come
back for more. Fuck all of you!

286
00:34:19,845 --> 00:34:23,838
Excuse me, excuse me!
- Shut up! What're you trying to do?

287
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:26,918
Shh, it's ok, shh...

288
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:30,719
What's going on?

289
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:34,483
Well, if you're figuring on ransoming,
you know,

290
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:38,487
Estelle's father works in an office.
- Shut up! Do you wanna get us killed?!

291
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:42,521
And my father doesn't have any money.
- The world doesn't spin only on money,

292
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:45,527
pinche guero.

293
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:49,642
Estelle? Is that your name, princess?
I like it. Estrellita,

294
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:53,683
that's what we'll call you.
Estrellita. You like that, Perdita?

295
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,570
What are you going to do to us?
- Nothing you won't like.

296
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:02,570
Show you where the people live.
Be a place to tell about, if you get

297
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:05,888
a chance on the next family picnic.
- Too bad you won't live to tell it.

298
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:09,846
Please let us go!
- She looks like Barbie.

299
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:14,006
You would stick your dick in a fucking
keyhole if you had the opportunity!

300
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:20,851
Listen, I understand that your people

301
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:25,124
have been, you know, oppressed by our
country. Ok?

302
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:29,335
And I feel for you,
you know? I mean, I really do.

303
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:33,369
But it's not our fault.
It's not our fault! Ok?

304
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:36,849
Well, why?

305
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:43,137
Are you going to kill us?
- Oh, my God!

306
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:47,848
No, we're not going to kill you.
- Ok, ok.

307
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:51,938
It's gonna be worse. What do you
think about Christmas in fucking hell?

308
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,450
Oh, my God!
- Holiday in hell! Holiday!

309
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,533
A fucking happy holiday!
You make it right, sugar!

310
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,733
You're the best. I love you.

311
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:07,014
Come on! Come on! Don't look at me
like that! Come on, cheer up! Fun!

312
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:11,095
Get party, ok? I'm gonna put a song
on I know you're gonna like.

313
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:14,214
Come on, listen to this.

314
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,175
It's Herb Alpert!
- And the Tijuana Brass!

315
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:21,177
This can't be happening!
- It's a sign! It's a sign, Perdita!

316
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:25,297
No hay duda, they are the chosen ones!
- Listen, please. Please, please...

317
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:01,782
Please! Help us!
- Hey! See you around, pendejo!

318
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:18,470
Sheriff?
- What now, Fed?

319
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:22,546
Somebody wants to talk to you.
- Does it have to be now?

320
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:26,793
Says he's from the DEA.
- I'll be damned! A big-shot.

321
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:29,786
Ok, gimme 2 minutes.
- Ok.

322
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,954
And shut the door behind you
on your way out, will you?

323
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:38,986
I'm sorry, Vicky.
We'll have to continue this later.

324
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:44,145
See you tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

325
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:48,546
This way, sir.
- Thank you.

326
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:52,951
How ya doing? Woody Dumas, Special
Agent for the Federal Narcotics

327
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:55,990
Division up there in Dallas.
- Rip Ford. Sit down.

328
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:59,748
Tell me how I can help you.
What happend to you?

329
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,797
Nothing. Sure is hot in here.

330
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,792
That's Susie.
- Thank you.

331
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,270
So, are you up to speed
on this operation?

332
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,319
What operation?

333
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:16,320
I sent you a fax two days ago.
- Oh, yeah, the fax from Dallas.

334
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:20,321
Yeah, I have it here. You're after
that character, what's his name?

335
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:24,315
Romeo Dolorosa.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be

336
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:28,356
a witch doctor, or something.
- Santero, drug dealer,

337
00:38:28,403 --> 00:38:32,158
bank robber, scumbag!
- Here it is.

338
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:38,558
I'll reckon he made it through
your ambush in Del Rio.

339
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:42,558
They say he disappeared like a ghost.
- Well, he was lucky.

340
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:47,399
Could have been magic, right?
Maybe this Romeo has a cloth doll

341
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:51,156
looks just like you,
stuck full of needles.

342
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,725
It says here his hide-out's
in Mexico.

343
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:57,766
Yeah, he's got a ranch on the border.

344
00:38:57,848 --> 00:39:01,966
I don't see how we can help you.
It's outside of our jurisdiction

345
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:05,968
and it's out of your jurisdiction
too, Special Agent Dumas.

346
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:10,009
Yeah, I know it's outside of your
jurisdiction and I know you're busy,

347
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,043
but I followed this guy for quite a
while and I know he works both sides

348
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,970
of the border wherever the money is.
- It's a big border.

349
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:22,762
Yeah, it is. But unfortunately for
you, they're here in Susie 'cause

350
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:26,805
I just saw her a few hours ago.
- Her? There's a woman involved, too?

351
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:31,846
Perdita Durango. She's as dangerous
as he is, maybe more.

352
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:36,693
This woman that you say you saw
has she done anything illegal

353
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:40,693
in the State of Texas?
- It's not gonna take her long

354
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:44,694
to break the law.
- Sheriff Ford speaking. Yeah.

355
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:50,409
2 college kids you say? You're sure?
Ok. Yeah, we're coming right away.

356
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:55,490
Yeah, thanks for calling, Phil.
- You know, Ava Gardner.

357
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:59,166
I always loved her lips.

358
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,500
Welcome to Negrita Infante!

359
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:27,174
What's the plan, Romeo?
- Forget about the plan, Adolfo.

360
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:31,415
The future has already been written.
- Cool.

361
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:35,456
You're the boss!
- No, you're the boss!

362
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,655
You're the boss!
- I say you are the boss!

363
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,979
Your're...

364
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,976
What's wrong with him?

365
00:40:45,024 --> 00:40:48,984
This is crazy! Oh, my God!
Where are we!

366
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:53,981
Looks like another planet.

367
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:57,178
This cannot be happening to me!

368
00:40:57,266 --> 00:41:01,260
Sleep a little, senorita.
- Please let me go!

369
00:41:01,307 --> 00:41:05,266
Don't you know they'll kill us?
- I know nothing, senorita.

370
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:09,341
What? You're with them! Look,
I have 40 dollars and a VISA card.

371
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:13,982
If you let me go,
I'll give you my number.

372
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,259
Ok. I'll give it to you now.
It's 7-4-7-0.

373
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,862
You want a blanket?
- Say something!

374
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,022
You want a blanket?
- Why are you doing this to me?

375
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,064
You wanna kill us, too? Is that it?

376
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:36,303
Fuck!

377
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,670
I want to share something with you,
Duane.

378
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:07,074
It's my treasure.

379
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,071
A sticker collection?
It looks interesting.

380
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,590
Interesting?!

381
00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:40,319
Duane,
when I first saw these drawings,

382
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:44,321
I started looking for answers
to the big questions in life!

383
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:47,992
What the fuck are we doing here,
Duane?

384
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:53,322
Why do we need to eat?

385
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,364
Why do we need to fuck
or watch TV? Tell me.

386
00:42:57,405 --> 00:43:01,364
Do you understand what I'm saying?

387
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:08,599
You're not one of those kids who doesn't
believe in anything? Are you, Duane?

388
00:43:09,406 --> 00:43:11,363
No,

389
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:14,604
I believe in a superior energy.

390
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:17,999
Energy?! Energy?! Fuck energy, Duane!

391
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:22,201
No, no, no! Don't start with
that hippie bullshit, ok?

392
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:26,208
I'm talking about Gods!
Gods creators of fucking universes!

393
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:31,006
Ok. Ok, all right. I believe, ok?
- Good.

394
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:39,082
God!

395
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:48,207
So Goldilocks wants to be a hero?
- Shut up!

396
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:59,167
I expected you to be a stupid-ass
white girl that depends on daddy.

397
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:03,208
I bet your biggest hope is to marry
some cocksucking cowboy, pump out

398
00:44:03,255 --> 00:44:07,248
2 blond kids perpetuating the cycle
endlessly. Isn't that right?

399
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:15,255
Give me the gun.
- I don't know what this is about,

400
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:19,210
but I do not wanna die!
- Ok, then kill me.

401
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:21,813
Go ahead, shoot!

402
00:44:21,898 --> 00:44:25,811
But if you miss...
- I know how to shoot a gun!

403
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:29,773
Really?
I'll give you piece of advice.

404
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,858
I don't need your advice.
- Lf you really wanna do something,

405
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:37,859
do it without thinking about. That's
the difference between you and me.

406
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,139
I would have killed you long time ago.
- For instance the Aztecs,

407
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:47,175
the old inhabitants of this land.
This people had this all figured out

408
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:51,181
thousands of years before
you and I were born, Duane.

409
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:54,454
See this guy? It's me.

410
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:57,615
And this here is you.

411
00:44:57,663 --> 00:45:00,461
Food for the Gods.

412
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:04,219
How many men have you fucked?
None?

413
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:07,622
I can't believe it.
You're still a virgin?

414
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:12,018
It's written all over your face.
It's ok. We've all been there.

415
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:17,219
Come on, this is stupid.
Gimme the gun.

416
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:20,100
That's good.

417
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:31,021
You know what they did to me at
school when I misbehaved?

418
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:34,618
They would whack my hands
with a ruler.

419
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,627
Kiss my feet! Come on!

420
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:51,982
Good girl.

421
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:55,945
You have to die to live.
- Oh, my God.

422
00:45:56,232 --> 00:45:58,223
Exactly.

423
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:02,024
Think of Jesus Christ.

424
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:08,867
Why are millions of people coming
together each Sunday

425
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:12,031
and drink his blood?

426
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:20,866
Tell me...

427
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:25,229
didn't you know that one has to
sacrify to the Gods?

428
00:46:30,637 --> 00:46:34,028
People forgot their religion.

429
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:38,471
I envy you, really.

430
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,797
Through your sacrifice
you'll be immortal

431
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:44,830
like Jesus.

432
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,917
Telling him a bedtime story, Romeo?

433
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,960
Well, just filling in a few holes
in Duane's education.

434
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:56,034
Well, my little intellectuals,
I have one or two holes

435
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:58,277
that I need filling, myself.

436
00:46:58,962 --> 00:47:01,954
This way. Sit down.

437
00:47:02,482 --> 00:47:04,633
Sit down!

438
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:10,322
Here, what are you doing?
What do you want?! Leave me alone!

439
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:14,243
Does it hurt, Estrellita?
Hm, Estrellita.

440
00:47:14,644 --> 00:47:18,240
Light of my life,
fire of my heart.

441
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:24,034
I'm not going to do
anything...

442
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,839
I hate her!
- I think your friend Duane likes her.

443
00:47:29,926 --> 00:47:33,966
Is he with her?
- I'm afraid so. But don't worry,

444
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:38,001
you're with me.
Romeo will take care of you, mi amor.

445
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:49,208
Put your hands up. Up! Up! Up!

446
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,640
Oh no!

447
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:16,410
Carajo! What the fuck is this?!
- What?

448
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:19,446
It's fake.
- Come on, Estrellita,

449
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:23,488
you don't need it. Leave it.
That's for the putas, Estrellita!

450
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:26,206
Carajo!

451
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:30,487
No!

452
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:35,888
What are your goals in life, Duane?

453
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:37,973
What?

454
00:48:42,778 --> 00:48:46,737
What are your plans for the future?
Come on, Duane, goals.

455
00:48:46,778 --> 00:48:51,216
All good American boys have them.
How often have you done this, Duane?

456
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,337
Huh?

457
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:07,134
Looks like you start to like me.

458
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:11,734
I already worried about.

459
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:20,656
Tell me sweets.
At least, I'm a woman.

460
00:49:42,507 --> 00:49:45,499
Oh, my God.

461
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:57,341
How many times?

462
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,861
10?

463
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,981
5?

464
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,262
Fuck! Once?

465
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,662
Shit.

466
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:11,743
So, how was it?
- I'll never forget.

467
00:50:15,672 --> 00:50:19,301
I'll make sure you don't forget,
'cause it'll be the only fuck

468
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:23,346
you'll have in your life.
Time's up, cowboy.

469
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,225
Ow!

470
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:29,267
There's no TV here,
but there's something better

471
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:33,069
I want to show you.
Come on. Get up!

472
00:50:52,598 --> 00:50:56,671
The two greatest pleasures in life
are fucking and killing.

473
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,040
So...

474
00:51:31,084 --> 00:51:35,077
I think it should be you who decides
who is going to be sacrificed.

475
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:39,038
You're the sorcerer.
- What about the gringo?

476
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:42,237
You chose him.
- Bullshit!

477
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:46,236
You're the one who started this!

478
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:50,279
You know all you wanted was that
little fucking blonde pussy, anyway.

479
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:54,077
The poor girl bled a lot, you know.

480
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:57,160
Just like caramel cream.

481
00:51:58,968 --> 00:52:02,847
Well, too bad she's not
a virgin anymore, huh?

482
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:06,882
Wouldn't it have been
better for your little ceremony?

483
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,087
Yeah that's true.

484
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,169
Why didn't I think
about it before? Shit!

485
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,367
Too late now. Anyway, I'm glad we'll
take a trip after the ceremony

486
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:23,405
because they'll be talking about it
for a long, long time.

487
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:29,686
Everything is falling into place.
I'm a lucky man, bonita.

488
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,650
Fuck!

489
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:43,086
If you call me bonita one more
fucking time, I'll fucking kill you!

490
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:55,028
Ok, it's time. The show must begin.
Before anything, I want you to know

491
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:59,035
that it's been a great pleasure
knowing you both.

492
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:03,069
You see, Duane, they'll kill us!
- This can't be happening.

493
00:55:03,116 --> 00:55:07,110
I mean, this can't be happening!
- I'm afraid it is, Duane, Cabron.

494
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:11,350
I mean, out there there's a bunch
of people that have come very far

495
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:16,392
for this and we cannot
let them down. So...

496
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:20,077
one of you will die.
- One? Only one?!

497
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,152
Yeah, that's right. Only one. I mean,
Perdita and I haven't decided who.

498
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,793
Best if we decide all together.
- What happens to the other one?

499
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,314
The other one gets a trip to Miami.
What's this here? A fucking contest?!

500
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:38,315
Ok. Ok. Who votes for Duane?
- I'm sorry, Duane.

501
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:42,321
Estelle, what the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna die.

502
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:46,322
But what about me?
- Relax, Cabron. Now you vote.

503
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:50,322
Let's see, whoever thinks, Estelle
should be the one, raise their hand.

504
00:55:50,403 --> 00:55:54,317
You son of a bitch!
- You're the only bitch around here.

505
00:55:54,444 --> 00:55:58,324
I saw you fucking him!
- He raped me!

506
00:55:58,445 --> 00:56:02,324
That's bullshit!
I saw you moving your ass.

507
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:06,479
After 2 years of playing square,
I've the same right to live as you do!

508
00:56:06,526 --> 00:56:10,520
When my father finds out what you've
done he'll chop your balls off!

509
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:14,321
Your father's a fucking joke!
- Shut up!

510
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:19,282
Ok. Perdita, what do we do now?
- I don't know.

511
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:23,321
After this fucking circus,
I think they both should die.

512
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:28,318
Excuse me,
the people are getting restless.

513
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:32,727
Ok, Adolfo, you decide. Which one?
- The gringa.

514
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,290
Who do you think you are?
Romeo, you're not listening to him?

515
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:41,723
I'm sorry, it's been decided.

516
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:46,725
Don't be scared, Estrellita.
Don't be scared.

517
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:53,046
Tonight, you'll be immortal.
You'll enter in the house of dreams

518
00:56:53,093 --> 00:56:57,087
where you'll live forever.
Stop crying, Estrellita!

519
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,614
No!

520
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:09,329
I was 10 years old
when they gave me the necklaces.

521
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:13,409
One for each god. Elegu Gemay
Chang Obataland Ochün.

522
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:22,051
Since then, my necklaces have
protected me from evil.

523
00:57:23,418 --> 00:57:27,730
Ache, ache, ache...

524
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:31,051
We live on a river bank.

525
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,536
That of the great light.

526
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:37,095
On the other bank
is the great night

527
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,212
where we find force to live!

528
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,096
If we return from the other side,
we'll have power,

529
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:47,497
power over others,
over our enemies.

530
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:51,621
Somebody help me! Somebody stop him!

531
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:55,937
We must triumph over those
who would keep us

532
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:59,973
in poverty and sadness!

533
00:58:05,824 --> 00:58:09,215
This is the truth.

534
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:12,064
We must devour our enemies

535
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:15,416
before they devour us.
This is the Pinaldo.

536
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:19,215
The saint's born from death.

537
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:24,819
Don't you want to see Romeo eating
your girlfriend's heart out?

538
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:29,299
Just might turn you on.

539
00:58:29,948 --> 00:58:33,908
You're a monster!
How can you do this?!

540
00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:37,299
Don't blame me, guerito!

541
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,343
Don't you remember?
You voted for her, too. Huh?

542
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,146
Enjoy the show, sweetheart.

543
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:54,144
You little piece of shit!

544
00:58:54,432 --> 00:58:58,141
Do you feel the fucking pain?

545
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:04,104
Go!

546
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:10,107
See if you fucking like it!

547
00:59:10,194 --> 00:59:12,230
Watch!

548
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:18,427
Only night gives strength
against the light.

549
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:22,355
No sainthood without death.
- Stop it! No!

550
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:53,911
Romeo!

551
01:00:42,168 --> 01:00:46,162
You remember me, honey?
Remember the money we owe Catalina?

552
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:49,962
Well, forget it. Now it's too late.

553
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:54,162
I bring him your fucking head!
Party's over, santero!

554
01:00:57,731 --> 01:01:00,723
Bitch! Bitch!

555
01:01:25,655 --> 01:01:28,647
Get off me! He's alive!

556
01:01:28,695 --> 01:01:31,733
Where's the other kid?

557
01:01:31,936 --> 01:01:33,927
Duane!

558
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:38,090
Get in the car! Get in!
Come on! Come on! Shit!

559
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:46,571
Are we gonna stay up here looking?
Plenty of them could've died!

560
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:50,618
They're a bunch of fucking killers!
- Hey! Forget about it, Fed!

561
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:54,612
Remember, we're not here.
- He's right. We can't do anything.

562
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:58,170
Who's this, a relative or something?
- My sister's boy.

563
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,332
Lucky you.

564
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:29,377
Go! Go! Go!

565
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:45,265
Fuck! No one says anything, or what?
- What the fuck do you want us to say?

566
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:49,347
Don't you wanna know who that was?
- What for? He's fucking dead!

567
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:53,428
All I want to know is what the fuck
are we gonna do with these two?

568
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:57,587
Give me time, Perdita, ok?
I'm trying to think of something, ok?

569
01:02:57,709 --> 01:03:01,703
Stop it, please stop it! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

570
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:11,341
Stop it! Enough! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

571
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:14,702
It's ok. It's ok.

572
01:03:15,952 --> 01:03:19,946
The meeting point is in Junction.
There, we will pick up the truck.

573
01:03:20,393 --> 01:03:24,545
If we drive all night,
we could get there on time.

574
01:03:24,713 --> 01:03:28,184
We can't be late, Perdita.

575
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:40,275
What's wrong, santero?
Did your gods abandon you?

576
01:03:46,717 --> 01:03:50,756
You see? We lost 'em!
- Relax, he's right in front of us.

577
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:54,393
Just can't see him.
If I go any faster,

578
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:58,554
he's gonna see us.
- You sure? He could've disappeared.

579
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,188
They say Dolorosa' a nagual.

580
01:04:02,879 --> 01:04:06,190
A nagual?
- A supernatural beast

581
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,399
that has a human head
and a jaguar's body.

582
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,434
Yeah, and a camel's dick!
- Best of all, he can make himself

583
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:18,475
invisible in front of his enemies.
- Well, that would explain many things.

584
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:22,515
Like how he get across the border?
- Yeah, with two naked and feathered

585
01:04:22,562 --> 01:04:26,476
kids in his back seat.
- You must be kidding.

586
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:32,163
You believe that Mexican bullshit?
- The stuff works if you believe in it.

587
01:04:32,204 --> 01:04:35,753
You know, one time I saw these guys
crash right into a brick wall 'cause

588
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:39,798
they thought they could go through.
- And did they?

589
01:04:39,845 --> 01:04:43,885
Little pieces went through. The rest
stayed splattered all over the wall.

590
01:04:45,126 --> 01:04:49,199
Should it be parked in the middle
of the road with those two inside?

591
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:53,800
Gonna wait.
You don't fuck around with Santos.

592
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:58,480
I promised Reggie I wouldn't.

593
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:01,640
True, you made a promise.

594
01:05:01,688 --> 01:05:05,648
And a Spanish gentleman never
breaks his promise, right?

595
01:05:05,729 --> 01:05:09,199
Even if it will cost him his life?

596
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:16,205
What do you want? That's how I am.

597
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:21,644
And you? What if I were killed?
Would you cry?

598
01:05:30,413 --> 01:05:34,645
Hey, Skinny? Skinny boy? Hey, what's
are you doing, popsicle dick?

599
01:05:34,853 --> 01:05:38,847
Come on, talk to me! Skinny boy?
What's going on? Come on! Come on!

600
01:05:40,574 --> 01:05:44,648
I think he has to pee.
- No, man, he wants to suck your dick!

601
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:48,851
Are you a bit nervous, Pete?
- Nervous? What the fuck would I have

602
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:52,889
to be nervous about, Cabron?
- Shit, partner! Look at the truck!

603
01:05:53,656 --> 01:05:56,649
You took 6 amphetamines, cafedrine,

604
01:05:56,697 --> 01:06:00,815
Korean, American and Siberian
Ginseng, 16 Giant E-zees!

605
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,450
Vitamins to keep me young.

606
01:06:04,658 --> 01:06:08,207
Yoo-hoo! What is it now, Mr. Fetus?

607
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:15,378
There it is!

608
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,980
Right on time.

609
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,297
Santos knows how to do things right.

610
01:06:45,355 --> 01:06:47,471
Hey, Dolorosa!

611
01:06:47,515 --> 01:06:50,985
Cool.
Dede Paralta, Pete Amendariz.

612
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:54,465
Fuck's up?
- Right smack on time!

613
01:06:55,155 --> 01:06:58,465
Mr. Santos will appreciate that.

614
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:02,986
Your instructions. In Las Vegas,
Reggie San Pedro is waiting for you.

615
01:07:03,515 --> 01:07:07,508
I know, I know. He's my cousin.
- That doesn't concern me.

616
01:07:07,555 --> 01:07:11,992
Mr. Santos'll be counting on you and I
hope you don't fucking let him down!

617
01:07:23,077 --> 01:07:26,815
Look at you, Skinny, you're frozen!

618
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:33,130
Piece of shit! Ass-munch!
Fucking gringo cocksuckers!

619
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:36,636
Shut up!
- Go fuck a cactus!

620
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,630
Estelle...

621
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:48,231
I think it's the police.
Shh... shh.

622
01:07:56,403 --> 01:08:00,636
All right, we got 'em. And those
other 3 assholes work for Santos.

623
01:08:01,524 --> 01:08:05,643
We can't go in like this Dumas.
We gotta call in some back-up.

624
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:10,477
Get off me! Go back to your
fucking crossword puzzle!

625
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:13,325
Come on!

626
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,925
Who's that?
- My woman.

627
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:21,966
The two in the back? Nephews?
What's this? Fucking family picnic?

628
01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:25,921
Shit! I hate working
with goddamned morons!

629
01:08:28,048 --> 01:08:31,325
Fuck!
- Alright, assholes! D.E.A.!

630
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:37,009
Drop your guns! Put your hands up!
- Fuck you!

631
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:41,004
Son of a bitch!
- Dede, cover me!

632
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:37,014
Shit! Goddamned devil!
Just go ahead and kill me!

633
01:09:53,383 --> 01:09:55,454
Skinny!

634
01:09:58,464 --> 01:10:00,455
Skinny!

635
01:10:04,745 --> 01:10:08,056
Now, you dumbfuck!

636
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,660
Shit!

637
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,745
Fuck you!

638
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:41,751
Motherfucker!
- Stop the fucking truck!

639
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:45,268
Stop the fucking truck!

640
01:10:47,113 --> 01:10:50,662
Your luck has run out, asshole!

641
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:46,353
Charly, take care of this baby.

642
01:11:46,443 --> 01:11:49,674
Yeah. Thank you very much!

643
01:11:57,845 --> 01:12:00,837
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Get off me!

644
01:12:00,885 --> 01:12:04,356
No, sir, please don't move. Lay down.

645
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:11,678
Lay down, sir!

646
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:40,362
Yeah,

647
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:44,682
the bambinos. Great, great! Yes.

648
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:53,493
What do we do now?
- They're all dead. Marcello, Peralta,

649
01:12:53,534 --> 01:12:57,494
Armendariz and fucking Skinny!
- They were all good men.

650
01:12:57,535 --> 01:13:01,848
They didn't deserve to die that way.
- Who would have thought that Dolorosa

651
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:05,890
was going to mess everything up?
- He came highly recommended.

652
01:13:05,937 --> 01:13:09,930
Seems like D.E.A. Was following
him for a while.

653
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:15,253
We must act quick to protect the
merchandise. I have to find that man,

654
01:13:15,298 --> 01:13:19,292
what's his name?
- Woody Dumas from Dallas. I know him.

655
01:13:19,379 --> 01:13:23,373
He's hurting us so bad.
- Everyone wants to get rid of him.

656
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:27,294
Even his bosses in Dallas.
- Who can we get?

657
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,494
It would be wiser to send an outside
representative to handle the job.

658
01:13:35,462 --> 01:13:39,375
Why not send The Fist?
- Yes, Provino Momo The Fist.

659
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:43,376
I know him well. I'll give him
24 hours to deliver.

660
01:13:43,463 --> 01:13:48,492
And tomorrow, we have one less worry.
- Man, my blessing goes with The Fist,

661
01:13:48,544 --> 01:13:51,696
and may God be with him.

662
01:13:52,185 --> 01:13:56,303
Girls! Hey!
- What do we do with Romeo Dolorosa?

663
01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:59,858
He's as dangerous as Dumas.

664
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:03,705
Stop that thief! Call the police!

665
01:14:13,668 --> 01:14:16,706
Hi, pendejos. I hope you like it.

666
01:14:26,631 --> 01:14:30,704
The idea of driving 1.000 Miles
with Estrellita makes me ill.

667
01:14:31,911 --> 01:14:36,144
What if I take Duane?
- He can take the car away from you.

668
01:14:36,592 --> 01:14:40,711
No. He'll come with me in the truck.
- What if I tie him up?

669
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:45,309
Bad idea. If anyone sees him,
we'll be fucked.

670
01:14:45,754 --> 01:14:48,871
So you'll do better with Estrellita.

671
01:14:55,756 --> 01:15:00,352
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I only tried it twice, you know,

672
01:15:00,396 --> 01:15:04,390
once, in summer before starting Junior
High, I had one of my father's Larks.

673
01:15:04,557 --> 01:15:08,710
I only smoked half and I couldn't do
anymore because I started coughing.

674
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:17,871
The second one was at a party
at my sorority, you know,

675
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:21,993
one of the student clubs that they
have. Mine was Kappa Gama Epsilon.

676
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,716
This time it was a lot better,
it was sweeter.

677
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:29,673
Look, I know, I know,

678
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:33,715
I'm just talking, and you hate me.
You do hate me, right?

679
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:37,802
I'm sorry. I'm so nervous,
I don't know what to do.

680
01:15:38,923 --> 01:15:42,917
I can't help it. Please,
are you ever going to talk to me?

681
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:46,436
Listen, you little cunt. If you don't
stop breathing down my fucking neck

682
01:15:46,484 --> 01:15:50,478
you won't make it
to he next gas station.

683
01:15:51,205 --> 01:15:53,197
Ok?

684
01:15:57,926 --> 01:16:01,920
My Dad used to sing this song to me
when I was a little boy.

685
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:06,447
Are your parents dead?
- They're on vacation in Europe.

686
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:10,317
They won a trip on one of those
TV shows for couples.

687
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:20,403
Was it one of those shows where Mom
tells millions of people

688
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:24,330
how she does it with Dad?
- They did 8 shows!

689
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:28,325
I mean, it was the worst 2 months
of my entire life!

690
01:16:29,812 --> 01:16:32,724
Well, and now this.

691
01:16:33,212 --> 01:16:36,569
It's not so bad. You're still alive.

692
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:42,008
Why are memories always so sad?
- Not always. Come on, I remember once,

693
01:16:42,934 --> 01:16:46,928
when I was a kid someone brought
movies to Petit Caribe.

694
01:16:47,455 --> 01:16:50,732
They showed them in my uncle's barn.

695
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:55,489
There I saw Burt Lancaster for the
first time in the movie 'Veracruz'.

696
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,893
Saint Burt Lancaster, man!

697
01:17:20,941 --> 01:17:24,411
He had about 108 giant gleaming teeth.

698
01:17:46,305 --> 01:17:50,299
Such a man I wanted to be combined
with the nobility of Gary Cooper.

699
01:17:54,787 --> 01:17:58,780
It's a dramatic ending.
It's the perfect ending for a man.

700
01:18:02,188 --> 01:18:05,339
The true path to Sainthood.

701
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:08,344
Yeah!

702
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:15,063
You're going to kill us when we get
to Las Vegas, aren't you?

703
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:19,104
Don't make plans. I hate people
who make plans, Duane.

704
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:24,071
Be best if we work things out
as we go along, amigo,

705
01:18:24,112 --> 01:18:28,071
don't you think?
- I would appreciate that.

706
01:18:41,681 --> 01:18:45,435
I think we should stay on touch, sir.

707
01:18:47,362 --> 01:18:49,353
Sir?

708
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:36,144
What's this?

709
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:40,264
Junction to...

710
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:45,264
Las Vegas.

711
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:51,065
Come on! Come on!

712
01:20:02,555 --> 01:20:06,753
Yeah, Doyle! What did you look at
the map with? Your fucking asshole?!

713
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,828
They're going to Vegas. Las Vegas!

714
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:12,151
Hello? Hello?

715
01:20:12,276 --> 01:20:15,747
Piece of shit phone!

716
01:20:40,281 --> 01:20:44,355
What's that strange sound?
Speak more slowly, sir.

717
01:20:44,442 --> 01:20:47,434
He's out of range.

718
01:21:03,045 --> 01:21:05,037
Fuck you!

719
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:31,563
This is your Captain Romeo Dolorosa
speaking. Welcome aboard.

720
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:35,604
Please fasten your seatbelts
and try to sleep.

721
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:38,922
Thank you very much. Fuck you!

722
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:43,051
Ok, guys. I hope to help out
with your little romance.

723
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:46,051
Don't touch me, ok?
- Estelle.

724
01:21:46,093 --> 01:21:50,132
Look, just fucking go fuck your
Mexican whore you like so much!

725
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:59,244
Come on, keep cool, Perdita.
Come on.

726
01:21:59,695 --> 01:22:03,689
Never done it in a plane,
how about you?

727
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:19,168
Pick a card.
- Go to sleep, Romeo.

728
01:22:19,298 --> 01:22:23,292
We have a long night ahead us.
- Precisely. Don't you want to know

729
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:27,299
what's going to happen tomorrow?
- I nearly forgot that you're

730
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:31,653
a crazy Santero.
- Every Santero uses his power

731
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:35,774
to predict the future. Even those of
us who are crazy. Pick a card.

732
01:22:39,582 --> 01:22:43,292
Luck. Plenty off luck.
Anyone wanna try?

733
01:22:43,783 --> 01:22:47,776
Come on, Duane.
The cards are sacred. They never lie.

734
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:51,256
Ignore him, he's making fun of us.

735
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:55,704
They are 18 cards and only
one of them is really bad.

736
01:23:00,906 --> 01:23:04,899
But it's not this one.
You're still a lucky guy, man.

737
01:23:06,707 --> 01:23:09,904
And now it's my turn.

738
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:25,663
Sir, we've spotted a group that fits
their description. They're in

739
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:29,784
a rest-stop just outside of El Paso.
- Follow but do not intercept.

740
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:34,064
If Dolorosa suspects anything
he's gonna kill those kids.

741
01:23:34,311 --> 01:23:38,305
Call our people in Las Vegas. Tell
'em I want to find the warehouse

742
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:42,312
where they store those fetuses.
- That won't be easy, sir.

743
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:46,386
Start with all the cosmetic labs.
There can't be that many.

744
01:23:46,433 --> 01:23:50,427
And tell them move their ass!
Hey, what's red and white

745
01:23:50,474 --> 01:23:54,468
and goes 60 Miles an hour?
A baby in a blender.

746
01:24:08,717 --> 01:24:11,710
Sons of bitches will never find her!

747
01:24:11,758 --> 01:24:15,114
What?
- Once they cross the border,

748
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,714
they can't ask for any favors.
- What border?

749
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:22,793
Mexican. I've to go after her myself.
Even if my wife thinks I'm crazy.

750
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,958
Sometimes it's better not to think so
much. Maybe you should read the paper.

751
01:24:28,161 --> 01:24:31,119
No, no, no. That's no relief.

752
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:34,717
A man's gotta do what
his heart tells him to do.

753
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:38,876
You understand what I mean?
You can't always be in control.

754
01:24:55,325 --> 01:24:58,318
Did you see what I just did?
It wouldn't have happened

755
01:24:58,366 --> 01:25:01,723
if you'd been here. Think about it!

756
01:25:11,888 --> 01:25:14,881
Some strange men came asking for you.

757
01:25:14,929 --> 01:25:17,921
We said nothing.

758
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:29,721
They said you owed Catalina money,

759
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:34,645
but I know they were lying
because I raised you

760
01:25:34,692 --> 01:25:38,732
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

761
01:25:53,335 --> 01:25:57,329
I was not afraid, I have seen
so much, my grandson.

762
01:25:58,056 --> 01:26:02,096
Even invisible things.
When you were born I knew

763
01:26:02,137 --> 01:26:06,177
you were special that when you died,
you'd turn into a jaguar

764
01:26:06,218 --> 01:26:09,290
and run along Caribbean beaches.

765
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:21,699
Everything ok?
- This place is like

766
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:25,654
an elephant graveyard.
Why are you awake?

767
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:29,741
Something's burning you inside.
- It's nothing.

768
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:34,655
It's your little girlfriend.

769
01:26:34,743 --> 01:26:38,736
My head is ringing from 12 hours
of uninterrupted teenage bullshit.

770
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:43,654
You're jealous. I like that.

771
01:26:54,746 --> 01:26:57,341
Hey! Hey! Wake up! Wake up!

772
01:26:57,387 --> 01:27:01,380
Come her! Come here! Look! Look!
So, it's our chance to escape.

773
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:05,381
If we find another way out of here,
they'll never find us.

774
01:27:05,468 --> 01:27:09,382
Estelle, you're crazy!
- Do you actually like that bitch?

775
01:27:09,549 --> 01:27:13,542
No, I'm trying to keep us alive.
- You're fucking coward!

776
01:27:13,589 --> 01:27:17,503
Second time you've called me that!
- Go ahead and hit me!

777
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:20,742
Deep down, you're just like them!

778
01:27:27,032 --> 01:27:28,750
Ok.

779
01:27:29,992 --> 01:27:31,984
Come on.

780
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:35,985
I don't see them. Hurry up!

781
01:27:36,073 --> 01:27:37,905
Go!

782
01:27:39,874 --> 01:27:41,785
Go! Go! Go!

783
01:27:41,834 --> 01:27:43,905
Fuck!

784
01:27:44,195 --> 01:27:46,265
Hurry up!

785
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:55,234
Go! They're behind us!

786
01:28:06,318 --> 01:28:08,833
Faster! Faster!

787
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,839
Faster! Faster!

788
01:28:31,883 --> 01:28:36,002
I thought you were stupid, but it
didn't think you were a traitor!

789
01:28:36,364 --> 01:28:40,357
I don't like traitors, Duane!
I don't like traitors! Understand?

790
01:28:41,765 --> 01:28:45,724
Shit, Duane, I trusted you!
I fucking trusted you,

791
01:28:45,765 --> 01:28:49,725
and this is how you repay me?
I'm going to fuck you over.

792
01:28:49,766 --> 01:28:53,726
I'm gonna kill you, ok?
Do you wanna know how it's gonna end?

793
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:57,760
This is it, man! This is fucking it!
- Oh, God! No, no, no! Please!

794
01:28:57,807 --> 01:29:01,767
It wasn't his fault! It was me!
It won't happen again. It was my idea!

795
01:29:01,808 --> 01:29:04,767
Forget it, Romeo!
- You shut up!

796
01:29:04,849 --> 01:29:08,842
Perhaps we can use him in Las Vegas.
Come on, this could bring us bad luck.

797
01:29:08,929 --> 01:29:12,923
How things changed! Before, you wanted
to shoot them in the desert,

798
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:16,964
now you're defending them!
- Nobody wants to defend anybody, ok?

799
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:22,325
This is not the right thing here, now.
- Now I'm the jealous one. Ok, Perdita?

800
01:29:22,372 --> 01:29:26,365
Estelle, what do you think?
Looks like they want to be alone.

801
01:29:26,412 --> 01:29:30,326
It wasn't his fault, it was me.
- Fucking asshole!

802
01:29:30,373 --> 01:29:34,367
You decide, Estelle, I finish him off
or I keep him alive to please Perdita.

803
01:29:34,414 --> 01:29:38,407
Forget it, Romeo! You're getting
out of hand. Let's get out of here.

804
01:29:40,615 --> 01:29:43,846
Stand up, gringo! Come on, Duane.

805
01:29:45,856 --> 01:29:49,849
How do you do it, man? Some day
you have to tell me your secret.

806
01:29:59,058 --> 01:30:02,176
Understand? You don't beat!

807
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,176
Reggie, my friend. Come in.

808
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,332
Have a seat.

809
01:30:14,381 --> 01:30:18,169
You know why you're here?
- I think so, yes.

810
01:30:18,261 --> 01:30:21,334
Is that a problem for you?

811
01:30:23,182 --> 01:30:27,176
Ok. I know you're raised up
together in one family.

812
01:30:27,303 --> 01:30:31,297
It takes a pretty long time
when se left Petit Caribe.

813
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:35,337
I don't object your cousin.
But he did some ugly things.

814
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:41,183
Even the Mexican Government wants
him to get off.

815
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:48,785
The Government is after my business.
Several of our associates are dead.

816
01:30:51,067 --> 01:30:55,061
Mr. Santos, if I only knew this...
- Don't excuse yourself.

817
01:30:55,108 --> 01:30:58,066
No one is accusing you
of doing anything.

818
01:30:58,108 --> 01:31:02,148
Romeo is doing me a favor
by driving the merchandise

819
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:06,183
for which he'll be compensated.
When the delivery is secure

820
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,860
give him the money we agreed on.

821
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,665
Then kill him.

822
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:17,263
Money is no good to him, he's dead.

823
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:20,344
So you take it
for doing me this favor.

824
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:23,863
That's most generous of you.
- Generous?

825
01:31:25,433 --> 01:31:27,424
Just!

826
01:31:27,633 --> 01:31:31,627
Treason is merely
a tool of resourcefulness.

827
01:31:32,194 --> 01:31:36,791
I know this will be hard for you
but I firmly believe

828
01:31:36,835 --> 01:31:41,148
that man must live his life
according to his own terms

829
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:45,189
or not live this life at all.
- I'm sure you are right, Mr. Santos.

830
01:31:46,837 --> 01:31:50,796
And I'm sure
you'll do a good job for me.

831
01:32:13,401 --> 01:32:17,395
I figure my little ladies are
wondering where I'm heading.

832
01:32:17,762 --> 01:32:21,722
I'll visit a friend in Nogales.
Estrellita, come with me.

833
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:23,794
What for?

834
01:32:24,043 --> 01:32:27,878
I'm thinking of selling you.
Get in, pendejo.

835
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:31,793
Where the hell are you going?

836
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:39,119
I'm going to dance with the devil
under the pale moonlight.

837
01:32:40,086 --> 01:32:44,080
Go fuck yourself, Romeo!
- What's wrong? It's from Batman.

838
01:32:44,127 --> 01:32:47,199
Fuck Batman!

839
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:06,683
One hit, one dollar! You want a hit?
You wanna hit, man?

840
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:09,809
Fuck, yeah!
- One dollar.

841
01:33:09,891 --> 01:33:13,851
Here's 10, kick my ass!
- Si, senor, for 10 dollars

842
01:33:13,892 --> 01:33:17,805
I make your hair sizzle!
- That's a car battery!

843
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:21,727
Give it me, motherfucker!
- Very macho, man! Very macho!

844
01:33:21,813 --> 01:33:25,727
Give it to me!
Give it to me, motherfucker!

845
01:33:30,735 --> 01:33:32,805
Oh, fuck!

846
01:33:34,055 --> 01:33:37,207
Electricity is cool, Estrellita.

847
01:34:10,421 --> 01:34:14,381
I'm looking for Catalina.
I heard he is here today.

848
01:34:14,422 --> 01:34:18,416
Catalina. About a debt.
- He's at the back.

849
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:48,660
Romeo Dolorosa.

850
01:34:48,868 --> 01:34:52,828
Girls, I want you to meet
a real bandido.

851
01:34:52,909 --> 01:34:56,379
Ladies.
- We heard you were doing a job for

852
01:34:56,429 --> 01:35:00,423
Santos with your cousin Reggie.
- Fuck! You keep yourself informed.

853
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:05,624
You have to keep up with everything
in this business. When you don't know

854
01:35:05,671 --> 01:35:09,665
what's happening, you're dead!
- Listen, Catalina, I'm here

855
01:35:09,712 --> 01:35:12,988
to settle my debt.
I don't like owing anyone anything.

856
01:35:13,032 --> 01:35:15,911
Well, you know that.

857
01:35:16,033 --> 01:35:18,911
Did you hear that, girls?

858
01:35:19,033 --> 01:35:23,027
The son of a bitch says
he doesn't like owing money to anyone.

859
01:35:23,074 --> 01:35:26,385
So you came here to pay me?

860
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:30,391
Sure. Yeah. And this is half.

861
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:35,469
I'll give you the other half
somewhere were we can talk.

862
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:40,225
Where did you find this beauty?

863
01:35:40,437 --> 01:35:44,431
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. She's the other half.

864
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:52,077
Come to my office.

865
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:55,112
You too, sweetie.

866
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,432
Stay here! Stay here, girls!

867
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:11,120
I don't want any.
- How come? It's pure. Good stuff.

868
01:36:11,162 --> 01:36:15,122
Come on, Catalina, she's not one
of those girls. She hasn't tried

869
01:36:15,163 --> 01:36:19,157
anything stronger than a diet Coke!
- Bullshit, Romeo. Gimme that!

870
01:36:19,204 --> 01:36:22,241
She's terrific. Innocent, clean.

871
01:36:23,044 --> 01:36:26,037
And her pussy's pure gold, man!

872
01:36:27,085 --> 01:36:31,045
You'll make triple what you make
with those dried-up cunts.

873
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:35,080
Where did you get her?
- Well, does it matter? We got a deal?

874
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:40,080
What are you talking about?
- Estrellita, Estrellita,

875
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:44,121
now this man owns you, ok?
And please don't make me look bad.

876
01:36:44,168 --> 01:36:48,082
You can't be serious.
- You're right. She's great!

877
01:36:48,929 --> 01:36:52,923
Let's toast.
- I hear you visited Petit Caribe?

878
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:56,849
No, no, no. I had no time.
I sent my associates.

879
01:36:57,010 --> 01:37:00,401
They did a good job.

880
01:37:01,091 --> 01:37:05,085
See, I don't like being owed money.
But you learned your lesson now.

881
01:37:05,132 --> 01:37:09,125
You're all paid up. That's it.
Everything is forgotten.

882
01:37:09,853 --> 01:37:13,812
No, Catalina, it's not forgotten.
- Then why the fuck did you come here?

883
01:37:13,853 --> 01:37:17,005
To kill you, pendejo!

884
01:37:56,341 --> 01:37:59,333
I'm dead so are you.

885
01:37:59,821 --> 01:38:03,815
Santos will kill you.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

886
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:08,456
Your cousin sold you out,
you sick fuck! Everyone knows it.

887
01:38:09,463 --> 01:38:12,455
You're lying!
- Reggie's gonna kill you

888
01:38:12,503 --> 01:38:16,497
after you make the delivery.
I'll be waiting for you in hell.

889
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:21,256
We'll have a great time there.

890
01:38:26,626 --> 01:38:29,857
See you later, amigo.

891
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:46,620
Remember,

892
01:38:46,669 --> 01:38:50,663
whatever happens, keep smiling, ok.
No long faces. Right?

893
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:53,948
Nothing happened in here, ok?

894
01:39:44,839 --> 01:39:47,877
Dance! Dance!

895
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,271
Dance!

896
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:03,877
Holy shit! He wasted him!
Son of a bitch!

897
01:40:17,605 --> 01:40:21,599
You saved my life
back at the airplane junkyard.

898
01:40:25,406 --> 01:40:27,045
Thank you.

899
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:31,080
Don't thank me.
Maybe what awaits you could be worse.

900
01:40:32,488 --> 01:40:36,481
I bet sometimes...
you wish you never met him.

901
01:40:36,848 --> 01:40:38,248
Who?

902
01:40:38,289 --> 01:40:40,280
Romeo.

903
01:40:40,969 --> 01:40:45,646
Listen. There's a lot of people in my
fucking life that I wish I never met

904
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:49,684
but Romeo is definitely
not one of them, ok?

905
01:40:51,131 --> 01:40:55,125
You ever think about an animal
eating you alive?

906
01:40:55,892 --> 01:40:59,885
I thought Romeo was going to kill me.
- I'm not talking about that.

907
01:41:00,733 --> 01:41:04,726
I'm talking about a wild animal
grabbing you an ripping you apart.

908
01:41:07,014 --> 01:41:11,007
I don't think of things like that.
- That's why you're so boring.

909
01:41:13,055 --> 01:41:17,048
Strangest people come up with
the most interesting ideas, Duane.

910
01:41:18,056 --> 01:41:21,366
I've never met anybody like you.
- I know.

911
01:41:25,017 --> 01:41:28,373
Let's go! Let's go!

912
01:41:31,298 --> 01:41:35,338
Why do you follow Romeo? Why don't
you just take off and leave him?

913
01:41:35,379 --> 01:41:39,372
Why don't you just shut up, please?
- Are you in love with him?

914
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,211
In love?

915
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:49,220
You sound like a fucking
Judith Krantz novel.

916
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:53,495
I'm just waiting for my money
and then I'll be gone.

917
01:41:53,902 --> 01:41:57,372
There won't be any money,
it's a trap.

918
01:41:57,662 --> 01:42:00,894
What the fuck are you talking about?!

919
01:42:00,983 --> 01:42:04,977
I know there's someone named Santos
who wants to kill Romeo in Las Vegas.

920
01:42:05,064 --> 01:42:09,057
A Mexican man told him before dying.
- Don't fuck with me!

921
01:42:10,225 --> 01:42:13,900
What the fuck are you saying?

922
01:42:14,025 --> 01:42:17,018
It's the truth.

923
01:42:18,946 --> 01:42:23,020
What? No, no, no. Forget the cops.
They know less than you and me!

924
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:29,500
Don't cry, sweetie.

925
01:42:29,548 --> 01:42:34,020
How would you feel if I started crying
instead of going out looking for her?

926
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,906
Estelle?!

927
01:42:51,952 --> 01:42:55,945
You cannot escape me!
You will be my love slave forever.

928
01:43:00,913 --> 01:43:04,907
Turn it off. All that jumping
is making me nervous.

929
01:43:04,994 --> 01:43:08,954
They jump so much because they have
super powers. Don't you understand?

930
01:43:08,995 --> 01:43:11,907
Here. Cocksuckers!

931
01:43:11,995 --> 01:43:15,068
Who the fuck is that!

932
01:43:16,396 --> 01:43:20,470
They said you grew another arm from
drinking so much Tequila, cabron!

933
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:22,465
Fucking Romeo!

934
01:43:22,517 --> 01:43:26,306
It's been a long time, man!
- A long time.

935
01:43:27,758 --> 01:43:31,911
You came here? You need something.
- I do need your help like always, guy.

936
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:37,113
I want you to meet my friends.
The poor little Duane.

937
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:41,153
My sad princess Estelle and that's
Perdita Durango.

938
01:43:44,361 --> 01:43:48,355
In the last 48 hours, I've had
2 near-death accidents.

939
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:53,598
Mexican Mafia tried to shoot at me.
Some fucking animal tried to rip

940
01:43:53,642 --> 01:43:57,636
my fucking head off and I haven't
had breakfast yet.

941
01:43:57,923 --> 01:44:01,917
Please, don't fuck with me today, ok?
All right? Just do you job.

942
01:44:04,604 --> 01:44:08,917
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid to listen
to other people's problems. Hm?

943
01:44:09,845 --> 01:44:14,362
No, you're right! But you are getting
paid to listen to my fucking problems

944
01:44:14,406 --> 01:44:18,400
'cause I'm your boss and I own you,
you little shit! So do your job!

945
01:44:18,487 --> 01:44:22,480
Oh, please, I'm so sorry. We're both
very tired, you understand

946
01:44:22,527 --> 01:44:26,521
I'm also tired! I haven't been shot
at but I've had 2 consecutive shifts

947
01:44:26,568 --> 01:44:30,562
sitting in front of the fucking
computer and I wanna go home to sleep!

948
01:44:32,249 --> 01:44:36,243
Yes. Yes, but first...
- There it is!

949
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:40,284
That's the same fucking list!
- I told you.

950
01:44:40,331 --> 01:44:44,290
Practically every company has some
type of problems with the law.

951
01:44:44,331 --> 01:44:48,325
Fines, toxins, illegal animal trade.
Yes, rhinoceros horns, dog fat...

952
01:44:49,172 --> 01:44:53,166
Shut up with the fucking animals!
Look at this! They're in Tucson

953
01:44:53,213 --> 01:44:57,206
and they're gonna be here in
4 hours... And we have nothing!

954
01:44:57,253 --> 01:45:00,530
Dick! Shit! Nothing!
- I'm sorry.

955
01:45:05,415 --> 01:45:09,409
Ok. Print all the companies that
don't have any violations.

956
01:45:13,576 --> 01:45:14,896
What?

957
01:45:14,937 --> 01:45:18,930
All the companies that don't have
any violations, that are clear. Print!

958
01:45:20,377 --> 01:45:24,337
3 and one of them is still
under construction.

959
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:35,693
Estelle, what's gotten into you?
- Forgive me for calling you a coward.

960
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:41,930
Forget it.
- It was to get you to react.

961
01:45:45,302 --> 01:45:48,339
It's ok. Really.

962
01:45:51,423 --> 01:45:55,417
Estelle, they can see us.
- Great, let them see!

963
01:45:56,064 --> 01:45:59,340
Oh, my God!

964
01:46:02,785 --> 01:46:06,016
I can't believe it.
- Come on, Duane.

965
01:46:06,826 --> 01:46:08,498
Estelle. My God!

966
01:46:08,546 --> 01:46:12,425
This might be our last chance
to do it.

967
01:46:22,068 --> 01:46:26,028
Anything wrong?
- No, everything is just dandy.

968
01:46:42,352 --> 01:46:45,310
Did I miss anything?
- Life's a bitch, huh?

969
01:46:45,352 --> 01:46:49,266
That guy just
got hit by a car across the street.

970
01:46:49,473 --> 01:46:53,467
You lose sight for a second...
- Death came as a surprise to him.

971
01:46:54,794 --> 01:46:58,788
There'll be many more surprises
when we arrive to that place.

972
01:46:58,835 --> 01:47:02,032
Well, I don't like surprises.

973
01:47:07,236 --> 01:47:10,434
Hey, you! Everything is ready.

974
01:47:15,277 --> 01:47:19,032
I don't think this is a good idea.
- Don't worry.

975
01:47:19,318 --> 01:47:23,312
They're good people, good friends
of mine. Doug was in Beirut with me.

976
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:27,272
What did he do, leave his arm there?
- Very funny, Perdita.

977
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:31,319
I crossed the battlefield with that
arm. It took me hours to get it

978
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:35,354
to the hospital. I got there too late,
though. It rotted.

979
01:47:37,361 --> 01:47:40,354
Take me with you. Come on!

980
01:47:40,402 --> 01:47:42,996
He only has one fucking arm!

981
01:47:43,042 --> 01:47:44,521
No.

982
01:47:44,562 --> 01:47:48,522
Someone has to take care of
the kids. I don't trust Lilly

983
01:47:48,563 --> 01:47:52,557
and Doug is an ex-marine.
- Don't fuck with me, ok?

984
01:47:52,604 --> 01:47:56,803
I don't want you coming, period.
Is that good enough?

985
01:47:57,045 --> 01:48:00,924
A piece of cake, Perdita. Drop the
merchandise, pick up the money,

986
01:48:00,965 --> 01:48:04,959
and that's it. We'll be back before
you notice we're gone.

987
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:31,921
I don't like
leaving things half done.

988
01:48:32,011 --> 01:48:35,924
I don't want to make my cousin
look bad.

989
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:39,566
Your cousin?

990
01:48:49,454 --> 01:48:51,445
Fuck!

991
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:14,975
I wanted to fuck you one more time...

992
01:49:19,299 --> 01:49:22,450
Romeo left these for you.

993
01:49:28,981 --> 01:49:32,178
Where are the keys?
- What keys?

994
01:49:32,221 --> 01:49:35,134
For the handcuffs.
- I have them.

995
01:49:35,182 --> 01:49:37,173
Give 'em to me.

996
01:49:37,222 --> 01:49:41,216
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
My husband said

997
01:49:41,263 --> 01:49:45,176
no one leaves until
he or Romeo return.

998
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,575
Ok.

999
01:49:49,544 --> 01:49:51,978
Pick a card.
- What's this? A game?

1000
01:49:53,265 --> 01:49:56,257
It's your future.

1001
01:49:58,626 --> 01:50:02,380
What does it mean?
- Bad luck.

1002
01:50:05,227 --> 01:50:05,898
Shit!

1003
01:50:05,947 --> 01:50:09,782
Where are we going now?
- Our little trip is over.

1004
01:50:09,828 --> 01:50:13,787
You're letting us go?
- That's right. I can't be driving you

1005
01:50:13,828 --> 01:50:17,822
around all the time, huh?
- You're going after him, aren't you?

1006
01:50:18,269 --> 01:50:22,263
It's your lucky day, sweetheart. Don't
blow it by asking stupid questions.

1007
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:25,822
Now go! Go!

1008
01:50:27,911 --> 01:50:30,823
Bye, Perdita.

1009
01:50:52,115 --> 01:50:56,189
Doyle, I fucking hate you!
I hate your little TV

1010
01:50:56,236 --> 01:51:00,229
and I hate your glasses
and I hate your stupid fucking tie!

1011
01:51:01,597 --> 01:51:05,476
Did you say something, Sir?
- No, nothing.

1012
01:51:05,597 --> 01:51:09,386
Do you see anything?
- Not a thing, sir.

1013
01:51:09,478 --> 01:51:12,550
Everything's quiet, nothing's moved.

1014
01:51:13,399 --> 01:51:17,358
Motherfucker, you're not gonna have
this job much longer 'cause I'm gonna

1015
01:51:17,399 --> 01:51:21,359
tell 'em put you back in uniform and
right back out on the street.

1016
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:25,360
As a matter of fact, when I get
through with you, you will guard

1017
01:51:25,401 --> 01:51:29,440
little shopping malls and put the
shopping carts back where they belong.

1018
01:51:55,606 --> 01:51:59,600
It's here! The truck! It's here!
- What the heck are you doing?

1019
01:52:00,927 --> 01:52:04,920
Right... Call the station.
And tell them I was right.

1020
01:52:05,328 --> 01:52:08,400
Right away, Sir.

1021
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:20,401
Fuck it!

1022
01:52:59,497 --> 01:53:01,488
Shit!

1023
01:53:02,778 --> 01:53:05,770
Bayou Chemical Industries.

1024
01:53:05,818 --> 01:53:09,812
Just opposite the Lock Shop
on Nevada Boulevard.

1025
01:53:10,779 --> 01:53:14,739
It's ok, Woody, all on their way.
All the units are on their way.

1026
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:18,773
Shut up! And don't call me Woody!
'Cause I can't fucking stand it!

1027
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:22,211
You understand? Don't call me Woody!

1028
01:53:33,783 --> 01:53:37,618
Hey, cousin.
- Hey, man. You've brought our pal.

1029
01:53:37,784 --> 01:53:41,618
Hi, Doug.
- You haven't changed.

1030
01:53:43,345 --> 01:53:47,418
Nothing's changed. Right, Reggie?
- Like always, us three.

1031
01:53:49,586 --> 01:53:52,862
Here's the money. Take it.

1032
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:57,857
Count it.

1033
01:53:57,947 --> 01:54:00,621
I trust you.

1034
01:54:03,748 --> 01:54:05,739
Shit!

1035
01:54:45,115 --> 01:54:46,548
Fuck!

1036
01:55:20,041 --> 01:55:21,634
Reggie,

1037
01:55:23,442 --> 01:55:27,436
I love you, Reggie.
Why are you doing this to me?

1038
01:55:27,523 --> 01:55:31,038
We are no longer in Petit Caribe,
Romeo.

1039
01:55:31,923 --> 01:55:35,633
I know.
- There's no other way out, man.

1040
01:55:35,764 --> 01:55:39,553
It's either you or me. What do you
ant me to do?

1041
01:55:39,645 --> 01:55:43,558
There's always another way out,
Reggie.

1042
01:55:50,927 --> 01:55:54,124
Look at me!

1043
01:55:54,727 --> 01:55:58,118
Look at me!

1044
01:56:18,291 --> 01:56:20,362
Oh, Romeo...

1045
01:56:21,092 --> 01:56:23,162
Romeo!

1046
01:56:39,215 --> 01:56:41,649
Hold it!
- Nobody move!

1047
01:57:25,063 --> 01:57:28,055
He's dead.
- Golly gee Mothercrist!

1048
01:57:28,143 --> 01:57:31,136
Look at his teeth!

Incredible!

1050
01:57:59,269 --> 01:58:02,067
What happend?

1051
01:58:50,638 --> 01:58:52,629
I'm tired.

1052
01:58:56,919 --> 01:58:59,672
I'm so weak.

1053
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,312
And I'm lonely.

1054
01:59:08,561 --> 01:59:12,156
I hurt so much.
I feel it hard to explain.

1055
01:59:16,282 --> 01:59:19,400
I can't trust love.

1056
01:59:19,483 --> 01:59:22,634
Because it won't stay the same.

1057
01:59:23,483 --> 01:59:26,078
Wow! Tired!

1058
01:59:27,764 --> 01:59:31,075
I'm so weak.

1059
01:59:31,805 --> 01:59:35,081
And I'm lonely.

1060
01:59:55,729 --> 01:59:59,086
I need somebody...

1061
