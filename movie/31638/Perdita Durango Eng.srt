1
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,957
Want another? Sweetie!

2
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,283
Bring me another Bud. And for you?
- What would you like?

3
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:14,080
Coke.
- Diet?

4
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:17,278
You fuckin' kidding?

5
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:20,325
You live in Mexico?
- Not exactly.

6
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:24,963
Hey, you heading out somewhere?
- Nowhere now. What about yourself?

7
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,841
Phoenix. 4 day software convention.

8
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:31,685
I'm a software salesman.

9
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:36,243
By the way, my name is Manny Flynn.
Half Jewish, half Irish.

10
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:40,002
What's yours?
- Perdita Durango.

11
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:44,006
Ah, that's a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman. Married?

12
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,237
Listen, Manny,

13
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:55,281
you want me to go to Phoenix with you?
You pay me way, you buy my meals.

14
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:59,520
I'll keep your dick
hard for 4 straight days.

15
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:02,798
While you're at the convention,
I'll do a little business myself.

16
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:06,840
Plenty of guys there, right?
I show some tit, milk a little cow.

17
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:11,843
Quick and clean. 50 bucks a pop.

18
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:15,880
I'll let you keep half of the profit.
How about it?

19
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,079
I gotta go.

20
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,998
Asshole!

21
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,278
Hands up! Hands up!

22
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:42,082
You're sisters?

23
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:47,520
Well, I had a sister, too.
Her name was Juana.

24
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,840
She had two little girls
that looked just like you.

25
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:56,641
You wanna see my sister? Yeah?

26
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:59,679
Open it.

27
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:10,000
That's my sister.
Her husband shot and killed her.

28
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:13,799
And then he took his gun

29
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:16,315
pointed to one

30
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:20,758
and then the other little girl
and he shot them both in the head.

31
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,242
Bang! Bang!

32
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,199
Thank you.

33
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,039
I need a drink.

34
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,475
Please stay behind the line
until you are called forward.

35
00:05:56,527 --> 00:06:00,202
All citizens entering the
United States with goods to declare

36
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:03,205
please move to the red corridor.

37
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:07,240
Remain in your vehicle until
interviewed by an Officer.

38
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:01,116
Forget it.
- My little virgin,

39
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:05,126
I think today is my lucky day.
- But not mine.

40
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:09,126
Lo siento, but I'm in a
bad mood today.

41
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,840
Come on, everybody needs somebody.
Even woman like you, Srta. Spitfire.

42
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:21,116
My name is Romeo Dolorosa.
My grandma is a witch,

43
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:25,160
my father was a Spaniard,
and I have a Mexican ranch.

44
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,481
Do you wanna come with me?

45
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,161
Well, my name is Perdita Durango

46
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:35,166
and I don't know shit about my fucking
parents and I don't wanna know shit

47
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:39,200
about your fucking little ranch.

48
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:46,760
You remind me of someone.
- Yeah? Who, Doris Day?

49
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me guess.
You're from Hollywood, right?

50
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:56,080
Probably think you can turn me
into a big star?

51
00:07:56,127 --> 00:08:00,564
But by the way you're dressed,
you remind me more of a faggot

52
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:04,680
or an extra in a bad Black
Sabbath video.

53
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,796
I like it.

54
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:12,635
Well, the truth is, I'm a scientist.
- A scientist?

55
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:15,599
No, you're definitely a dentist.

56
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:19,282
I could tell from that stupid smile
on your face.

57
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:23,286
It's the truth. Science is everything.
Scientists need money,

58
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:28,082
like everyone else. They need funds
to continue their research.

59
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:32,160
So, that's why I'm here
on this side of the border.

60
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:36,246
I see. Well, you're looking to the
wrong person for a donation. So...

61
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:39,677
Don't worry.
We have plenty of donations.

62
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,759
Like 12.000 dollars I just received

63
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,241
this morning
from the Morgens Interstate Bank.

64
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:49,280
Keep quiet! Fucking hell!
I don't want one fucking move!

65
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,400
Don't move! Don't fucking move!
- Shut up!

66
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,560
If you keep quiet, nothing's
gonna happen, alright?

67
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,280
The money! Quick! Here!

68
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:09,080
Take off your shirt.
Come on, take off your shirt!

69
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:13,202
What the fuck are you doing, man?!
You're crazy!

70
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:16,239
Come on, show me your titties.
Keep going...

71
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,280
The bra... Come on, the bra! The bra!
- What the fuck you doing, man?!

72
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:24,235
It's not the time!
- Oh, Good Lord!

73
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,959
Come here!
- Do you hear me? Let's go! Shit!

74
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:31,682
Sweet mother of God!
Move! Move! Move!

75
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:43,600
Come on, Romeo! Are you nuts, or what?
Run! Fuck you!

76
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,999
Santero psychopath!

77
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:06,566
Ok, thank you very much.
Here you go, the mask of El Santo.

78
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,202
It will bring you good luck.
Thank you very much.

79
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:14,240
You had to do it your way!
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

80
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:18,606
It's the last time I'm working
with you, cabron! Fucking clown!

81
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:23,166
Piece of shit, Santero. He had
to wear that fuckin' little mask,

82
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,802
you know, like El Santo.

83
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:31,726
Hey, man, how much did we get?
- I don't know, man! I don't know.

84
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:35,726
Maybe 20.000, maybe more.
- I hope it's more. At least 25.

85
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,726
One grand for each and the rest for
the mother-fucking Catalina!

86
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:44,158
Forget about Catalina, cabron.
- It's scary, man! I'm scared shitless!

87
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:50,276
Last week, we owed him 20 grand,
and now it's 23!

88
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:54,679
If we don't pay him soon, he'll kill
us and make a belt with our nipples!

89
00:10:56,647 --> 00:11:00,606
Y eso no es funny, no senor.
We shouldn't have borrowed

90
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:04,276
money from him, I told you,
I told... Romeo?

91
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:06,917
Romeo!

92
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:10,678
Fuck!

93
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,960
Holy fucking shit!
I'll get you, man! I'll get you!

94
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,997
Your luck is running out today, uh?
- Trust science, Perdita.

95
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:36,006
I have different plans of my own.
I get out of here. I'll donate my body

96
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:39,596
to science when I'm dead.
- You don't have to.

97
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:43,680
I already took care of that. Look.
- Are you fucking crazy?

98
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:47,239
C'mon trust in my science, Perdita.

99
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:53,438
Do you want to cross the border
with me?

100
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:57,520
So what the fuck are you?
A grave-robber or a bank-robber?

101
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,960
I do it all, my love.
I got a really busy schedule today.

102
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:25,075
Your papers, please.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:44,081
Anything to declare?
- Nothing, Officer.

104
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:01,520
All right. You may continue.
- Thank you.

105
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:09,081
Trust in science, Perdita.
Trust in science.

106
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:13,280
I come from the island Petit Caribe,
3 Miles long, 1 Mile wide.

107
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,885
When I was a kid, there were only
2 cars. And one day, of course,

108
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:20,282
they crashed.

109
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:26,085
Sooner or later,
it was bound to happen.

110
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:31,121
It was impossible for it not
to happen. That's how the world turns.

111
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,680
That's how you and I met, Perdita.

112
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:18,076
You'll be my Yalocha...
- What?

113
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:21,677
My High Priestess.

114
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:26,238
You can help me with the ritual.
Last night I dreamt about it,

115
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:29,962
I dreamt I was licking your body.

116
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,157
Stop! Stop!

117
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:37,079
Did I do this?

118
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:41,559
What the fuck are you talking about?!

119
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:45,600
I'm a sorcerer, Perdita.
Your Babalou.

120
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:49,880
It's rule of Ocha.
Santeria, my science.

121
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:54,280
Don't talk shit o me. You don't
believe in those things, do you?

122
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:59,159
I do believe in its power.

123
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:03,281
You want to see it or are you scared?

124
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:32,561
I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Why not? It scares evil spirits away.

125
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:37,645
I don't believe in voodoo bullshit.
I doubt if those people did either.

126
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:41,566
It's not voodoo. It's Santeria.
It's not the same.

127
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:44,719
Little magical tricks.
Latin bullshit.

128
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:48,760
But it works. You saw it.
- Yeah, but for how long?

129
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:52,004
You know, people are not that stupid.
- Yeah,

130
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,164
do you have a better idea, smartass?

131
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,558
Yeah,

132
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,758
you know what?

133
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:07,076
We should kill someone.
- What?

134
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah, we should kill them
and then we should eat them.

135
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:20,040
Fuck! Like animals, mi amor?
- That's right.

136
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:25,166
It'll be ingrained
in their brains forever.

137
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:30,879
Let's do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow is not good.

138
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:34,681
I have a date across the border.
- A date?

139
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,125
Son of a bitch.
- It's not what you think.

140
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:46,085
It's business.

141
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:54,597
Being a kid in Caribe, I spent every
day in the port with my cousin Reggie.

142
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:58,686
There were huge ships, everyone going
to different places.

143
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:03,965
Panama, Mexico, Hong Kong, Lisboa.
Places that we couldn't imagine.

144
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,960
From the moment, I knew I would go
far into the world, beyond Caribe.

145
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,439
Yeah? What went wrong?
- What do you mean?

146
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:17,446
This isn't exactly Paris, sweetheart.
- Fuck you!

147
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,960
Fuck! I lived in Paris for 2 years,
mademoiselle, and 4 years in Madrid.

148
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,763
You know Madrid? Look at this...
Mira, mira. Esto...

149
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,686
I got this from a bull.
I was a bullfighter.

150
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,958
And this is fuckin' souvenir
from Beirut. The Marines!

151
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:37,000
The greatest travel agency
in this fuckin' wide world.

152
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,685
What are you thinking in that
little head of yours?

153
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:49,958
I'm thinking,

154
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:54,000
that if we're gonna do a kidnapping,
we should get a gringo.

155
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:57,244
A guero?
- It'll be impressive.

156
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,682
Adolfo, did you hear that?
- Killing gueros?

157
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,880
Fucking hell! Living with you
will be kickass!

158
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:24,565
(Song) Who can turn the world on
with her smile?

159
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,883
Coming! Coming! I'm coming!

160
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:34,279
Hello, Mrs. Satisfy.

161
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,876
Is Estelle here?
- Of course she is.

162
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,646
Come on in. Come on in. Estelle?

163
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,839
Estelle, honey, Duane's here.

164
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:49,602
Oh, please don't make him wait.
Now, come on down!

165
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:53,003
Hello, Mr. Satisfy.
- Hi.

166
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:57,597
I'll be down in a second.

167
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:06,761
Estelle! Don't you hear me?
Come down!

168
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:10,960
What is Duane gonna think
of us? Oh, she is the worst!

169
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,561
Duane,

170
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:18,600
in this world, you have to be
in control.

171
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:22,640
It's the only thing that
makes us different from the animals.

172
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:26,646
Absolutely, Mr. Satisfy.
- Ah, you can call me Herb.

173
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:30,805
You know, when we were dating,
Glory Ann always called me Herb

174
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:34,760
after Herb Alpert, the musician.
You know?

175
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:42,720
The Tijuana Brass, you heard of them,
right?

176
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,878
Well,

177
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:48,204
not really...
- What is that?

178
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:52,240
It's a free-form mobile, representing
the 4 basic food groups...

179
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,518
Here they come.
- Ta-ta-ta-ta!

180
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,320
Here she is!

181
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:01,843
You look beautiful.
- Ok, you two kids.

182
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:05,880
Go out now and have a good time.
- Estelle said you're heading to Susie?

183
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:10,680
Ah, that's where the young ones go
to have fun nowadays?

184
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,405
Yeah, well...
- Let's go, Duane, otherwise

185
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:18,440
we might never get out of here.
- Duane, remember what I told you.

186
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:23,237
(Together) Always be in control!

187
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:42,798
They haven't arrived yet.

188
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:46,237
No. Where is Perdita?
- Shopping.

189
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:30,246
My, God! Are you alright, Sir?
I could've killed you!

190
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:34,075
Call an ambulance! Call for help!

191
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:37,364
Alright, alright, alright!

192
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,882
Please, stop touching me!
Stop touching me!

193
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,958
Shit!

194
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:49,079
Excuse me, Sir...

195
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:06,077
It's the Holy Bible.

196
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:20,280
You also have a letter.
Is it a secret admirer?

197
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:26,166
Oh, my God! Is my number one fan.
Is my grandmother Maria Jose, man!

198
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:30,680
I love her! I love that woman.
She always writes o me, man.

199
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:34,882
The oldest woman in Petit Caribe.
I mean, no one knows how old she is.

200
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:38,920
Whatever happened in my country,
she was there to tell the story.

201
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,960
She can't write, so she dictates her
letters to my cousin Danny Mestiza.

202
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,680
Even when my cousin Reggie and I were
in Beirut, she sent me a letter.

203
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:49,766
We got the money you sent.
Danny says thanks, and so do I.

204
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:56,960
I'm reading the Bible, looking for
the place where you're fighting.

205
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:01,079
Have you seen the Garden of Eden?

206
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:29,085
Did you see it?
- What, man?

207
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,159
The Garden of Eden.

208
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:36,240
Of course! Fuck, Adolfo, of course,
man! That's when I saw the Devil.

209
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:41,000
Garlic sprouted everywhere
he stepped.

210
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:50,119
There they are. Stay put.

211
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,238
Wait.

212
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:14,679
Primo!
- Reggie, man!

213
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:20,124
Hey, man! I missed you, asshole!

214
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:24,077
As elegant as ever. How's business?

215
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:28,281
I get by...
- That's over, man, that's over!

216
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:32,076
We're too big for this fucking border.

217
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm changing your luck, Romeo.
You know Marcelo Santos?

218
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:41,520
Crazy Eyes Santos?
- Don't ever call him that!

219
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:45,600
He hates it. It pisses him off.
- Are you working for him now?

220
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:50,600
I told you, man, big business.
Big business!

221
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:54,078
Listen. You're my brother. My brother.

222
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:59,077
Mr. Santos wants to meet you.

223
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:04,240
He's here?
- In the car.

224
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:19,964
Mr. Dolorosa.
You like the jabugo ham?

225
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:23,642
It's illegal but delicious.
- Thanks. It's a pleasure

226
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:27,646
meeting you, Mr. Santos.
- I know it's a strange place to meet,

227
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:31,680
but I'm on my way to another business
meeting, and I hate to fly. Drink?

228
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:34,718
Yeah, thanks.

229
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,759
Your cousin Reggie,
he speaks very highly of you.

230
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:41,800
He tells me you send money back home
to your family. I like that.

231
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:47,483
Well, Reggie and I are very tight,

232
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:51,236
but he might have exaggerated
a little, Mr. Santos.

233
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:55,678
You don't have to be humble with me.
I need someone like you by my side.

234
00:28:56,407 --> 00:29:00,400
Here's my proposal. It's very simple.
In 48 hours, a truck will arrive.

235
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:05,280
A refrigerated, semi-trailer truck
loaded with human embryos

236
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,879
for the cosmetic industries.

237
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:13,326
You make a skin cream with fetuses?
- Not a bad idea, although it's not

238
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:17,440
originally mine. You see, the Nazis
made bars of soap out of the Jews.

239
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:24,037
Yeah, and you adapted it to our times?
- More or less. People want to be

240
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:28,046
so beautiful nowadays, hu? You have
to give them that they want.

241
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:32,205
Sure, everyone wants to look younger.
- Anyway, we must get this shipment to

242
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:36,240
a secret lab in Las Vegas right away.
- Right. You want me to go with Reggie?

243
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,359
No, I have other plans for him.

244
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:43,400
They tell me that you know the area.
Can you do it?

245
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,198
Certainly, Mr. Santos.
I'm glad to help.

246
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:51,081
Muy bueno. Now I have 10.000 dollars
for you in old bills.

247
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:56,281
The driver will have an envelope
with your instructions.

248
00:29:56,447 --> 00:30:00,406
When you arrive safely in Las Vegas,
your cousin Reggie will give you

249
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:05,475
another 10.000 dollars. You remember
always, that God and I are with you.

250
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:34,679
Hey, chica! Looking for someone?
- Where the hell did you get that?

251
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:38,284
I took it from a kid. Get in.
Get in!

252
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,880
Ow! You are a clown, you know that?
- A clown with a golden dick.

253
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,037
Right.

254
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:56,242
Look, preciosa, look.

255
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:04,480
Yes! You little devil, you!
So your date was with a bank?

256
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:08,520
No, something better. We have to go
on vacation, isn't that great?

257
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:12,800
And when we get there, there'll be
another package like this. Give me!

258
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:20,726
Sounds like a good plan.
- Yes. We'll leave tomorrow night.

259
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:25,204
We've enough time for our little show.
Adolfo is getting ready everything.

260
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:29,526
I thought with everything that's
going on, I thought you would probably

261
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:33,401
forget about that Santero.
- Forget about it? Are you crazy?

262
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:37,480
It's the only thing I can think about.
Now more than ever. We need a good

263
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:41,440
sacrifice to appease the gods.
- Well, this is the perfect place.

264
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:45,520
There's nothing but little fuckin'
lambs walking around here.

265
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:51,281
We just have to think about doing it.
- It's easy. Just stop someone and say:

266
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:55,360
I'm Palo Mayombe High Priestess.
Mind if I cut your throat and eat

267
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:59,480
your heart? Ok, what should we get?

268
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,597
I don't know.

269
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:06,646
How about something blond, tanned,

270
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:08,678
muscular?

271
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:12,164
Are you gonna fuck him or eat him?

272
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:16,164
Maybe both.
- Ok.

273
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:50,479
Here's your man.
- He's no good.

274
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:54,361
What do you mean he's no good?
- From far away he looked different.

275
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:58,366
Esta fuckin' borracho! I hate drunks.
- What do I do with him now?

276
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:02,480
I don't know. Why don't you lave him
where you found him?

277
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,559
Who the hell are you people?

278
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,679
You crazy bitch!

279
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:12,004
Sorry, man. Who understands women?

280
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:16,280
What are you doing?
- Watch, wait and see.

281
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:30,520
Shut up! Shut up!
Fucking blow your heads off!

282
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,999
Come on! Come on!

283
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:56,760
They're gonna kill the kids! They're
the devils! I saw it in their eyes!

284
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:01,800
They're gonna eat them and come
back for more. Fuck all of you!

285
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:10,000
Excuse me, excuse me!
- Shut up! What're you trying to do?

286
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:13,079
Shh, it's ok, shh...

287
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,879
What's going on?

288
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:20,643
Well, if you're figuring on ransoming,
you know,

289
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:24,646
Estelle's father works in an office.
- Shut up! Do you wanna get us killed?!

290
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,680
And my father doesn't have any money.
- The world doesn't spin only on money,

291
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,685
pinche guero.

292
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:35,800
Estelle? Is that your name, princess?
I like it. Estrellita,

293
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:39,840
that's what we'll call you.
Estrellita. You like that, Perdita?

294
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:44,726
What are you going to do to us?
- Nothing you won't like.

295
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:48,726
Show you where the people live.
Be a place to tell about, if you get

296
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:52,043
a chance on the next family picnic.
- Too bad you won't live to tell it.

297
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:56,000
Please let us go!
- She looks like Barbie.

298
00:34:56,167 --> 00:35:00,160
You would stick your dick in a fucking
keyhole if you had the opportunity!

299
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:07,004
Listen, I understand that your people

300
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:11,276
have been, you know, oppressed by our
country. Ok?

301
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:15,486
And I feel for you,
you know? I mean, I really do.

302
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:19,520
But it's not our fault.
It's not our fault! Ok?

303
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,999
Well, why?

304
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:29,286
Are you going to kill us?
- Oh, my God!

305
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:33,997
No, we're not going to kill you.
- Ok, ok.

306
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:38,086
It's gonna be worse. What do you
think about Christmas in fucking hell?

307
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:41,597
Oh, my God!
- Holiday in hell! Holiday!

308
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:45,680
A fucking happy holiday!
You make it right, sugar!

309
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:48,879
You're the best. I love you.

310
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:53,160
Come on! Come on! Don't look at me
like that! Come on, cheer up! Fun!

311
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:57,240
Get party, ok? I'm gonna put a song
on I know you're gonna like.

312
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:00,359
Come on, listen to this.

313
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:03,319
It's Herb Alpert!
- And the Tijuana Brass!

314
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:07,320
This can't be happening!
- It's a sign! It's a sign, Perdita!

315
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:11,440
No hay duda, they are the chosen ones!
- Listen, please. Please, please...

316
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:47,919
Please! Help us!
- Hey! See you around, pendejo!

317
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:04,605
Sheriff?
- What now, Fed?

318
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:08,680
Somebody wants to talk to you.
- Does it have to be now?

319
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:12,926
Says he's from the DEA.
- I'll be damned! A big-shot.

320
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,919
Ok, gimme 2 minutes.
- Ok.

321
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:20,086
And shut the door behind you
on your way out, will you?

322
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:25,117
I'm sorry, Vicky.
We'll have to continue this later.

323
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:30,276
See you tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

324
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:34,676
This way, sir.
- Thank you.

325
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:39,080
How ya doing? Woody Dumas, Special
Agent for the Federal Narcotics

326
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:42,119
Division up there in Dallas.
- Rip Ford. Sit down.

327
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:45,876
Tell me how I can help you.
What happend to you?

328
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,925
Nothing. Sure is hot in here.

329
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,919
That's Susie.
- Thank you.

330
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,397
So, are you up to speed
on this operation?

331
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:58,445
What operation?

332
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:02,446
I sent you a fax two days ago.
- Oh, yeah, the fax from Dallas.

333
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:06,446
Yeah, I have it here. You're after
that character, what's his name?

334
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:10,440
Romeo Dolorosa.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be

335
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:14,480
a witch doctor, or something.
- Santero, drug dealer,

336
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:18,281
bank robber, scumbag!
- Here it is.

337
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:24,680
I'll reckon he made it through
your ambush in Del Rio.

338
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:28,680
They say he disappeared like a ghost.
- Well, he was lucky.

339
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:33,520
Could have been magic, right?
Maybe this Romeo has a cloth doll

340
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:37,276
looks just like you,
stuck full of needles.

341
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:40,845
It says here his hide-out's
in Mexico.

342
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,885
Yeah, he's got a ranch on the border.

343
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:48,085
I don't see how we can help you.
It's outside of our jurisdiction

344
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:52,086
and it's out of your jurisdiction
too, Special Agent Dumas.

345
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:56,126
Yeah, I know it's outside of your
jurisdiction and I know you're busy,

346
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,160
but I followed this guy for quite a
while and I know he works both sides

347
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:04,086
of the border wherever the money is.
- It's a big border.

348
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:08,878
Yeah, it is. But unfortunately for
you, they're here in Susie 'cause

349
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:12,920
I just saw her a few hours ago.
- Her? There's a woman involved, too?

350
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:17,960
Perdita Durango. She's as dangerous
as he is, maybe more.

351
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:22,806
This woman that you say you saw
has she done anything illegal

352
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:26,806
in the State of Texas?
- It's not gonna take her long

353
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,806
to break the law.
- Sheriff Ford speaking. Yeah.

354
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:36,520
2 college kids you say? You're sure?
Ok. Yeah, we're coming right away.

355
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:41,600
Yeah, thanks for calling, Phil.
- You know, Ava Gardner.

356
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:45,276
I always loved her lips.

357
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:07,606
Welcome to Negrita Infante!

358
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:13,280
What's the plan, Romeo?
- Forget about the plan, Adolfo.

359
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:17,520
The future has already been written.
- Cool.

360
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:21,560
You're the boss!
- No, you're the boss!

361
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,759
You're the boss!
- I say you are the boss!

362
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:27,082
Your're...

363
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:31,079
What's wrong with him?

364
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:35,086
This is crazy! Oh, my God!
Where are we!

365
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:40,082
Looks like another planet.

366
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:43,279
This cannot be happening to me!

367
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:47,360
Sleep a little, senorita.
- Please let me go!

368
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:51,366
Don't you know they'll kill us?
- I know nothing, senorita.

369
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:55,440
What? You're with them! Look,
I have 40 dollars and a VISA card.

370
00:40:56,167 --> 00:41:00,080
If you let me go,
I'll give you my number.

371
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:04,357
Ok. I'll give it to you now.
It's 7-4-7-0.

372
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,959
You want a blanket?
- Say something!

373
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:12,119
You want a blanket?
- Why are you doing this to me?

374
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:16,160
You wanna kill us, too? Is that it?

375
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,398
Fuck!

376
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:48,761
I want to share something with you,
Duane.

377
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:53,164
It's my treasure.

378
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:19,157
A sticker collection?
It looks interesting.

379
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,676
Interesting?!

380
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:26,404
Duane,
when I first saw these drawings,

381
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:30,406
I started looking for answers
to the big questions in life!

382
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:34,076
What the fuck are we doing here,
Duane?

383
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:39,405
Why do we need to eat?

384
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,446
Why do we need to fuck
or watch TV? Tell me.

385
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:47,446
Do you understand what I'm saying?

386
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:54,680
You're not one of those kids who doesn't
believe in anything? Are you, Duane?

387
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:57,443
No,

388
00:42:57,487 --> 00:43:00,684
I believe in a superior energy.

389
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:04,078
Energy?! Energy?! Fuck energy, Duane!

390
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:08,280
No, no, no! Don't start with
that hippie bullshit, ok?

391
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:12,286
I'm talking about Gods!
Gods creators of fucking universes!

392
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:17,083
Ok. Ok, all right. I believe, ok?
- Good.

393
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,158
God!

394
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:34,282
So Goldilocks wants to be a hero?
- Shut up!

395
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:45,240
I expected you to be a stupid-ass
white girl that depends on daddy.

396
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:49,280
I bet your biggest hope is to marry
some cocksucking cowboy, pump out

397
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:53,320
2 blond kids perpetuating the cycle
endlessly. Isn't that right?

398
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:01,326
Give me the gun.
- I don't know what this is about,

399
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:05,280
but I do not wanna die!
- Ok, then kill me.

400
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,883
Go ahead, shoot!

401
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:11,880
But if you miss...
- I know how to shoot a gun!

402
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:15,841
Really?
I'll give you piece of advice.

403
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:19,926
I don't need your advice.
- Lf you really wanna do something,

404
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:23,926
do it without thinking about. That's
the difference between you and me.

405
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:28,205
I would have killed you long time ago.
- For instance the Aztecs,

406
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:33,241
the old inhabitants of this land.
This people had this all figured out

407
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:37,246
thousands of years before
you and I were born, Duane.

408
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:40,518
See this guy? It's me.

409
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:43,679
And this here is you.

410
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:46,525
Food for the Gods.

411
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:50,282
How many men have you fucked?
None?

412
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,684
I can't believe it.
You're still a virgin?

413
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:58,080
It's written all over your face.
It's ok. We've all been there.

414
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:03,280
Come on, this is stupid.
Gimme the gun.

415
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,161
That's good.

416
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,080
You know what they did to me at
school when I misbehaved?

417
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:20,676
They would whack my hands
with a ruler.

418
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:30,684
Kiss my feet! Come on!

419
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:38,038
Good girl.

420
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:42,000
You have to die to live.
- Oh, my God.

421
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:44,278
Exactly.

422
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:48,078
Think of Jesus Christ.

423
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:54,920
Why are millions of people coming
together each Sunday

424
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:58,084
and drink his blood?

425
00:46:04,687 --> 00:46:06,917
Tell me...

426
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:11,280
didn't you know that one has to
sacrify to the Gods?

427
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:20,077
People forgot their religion.

428
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,519
I envy you, really.

429
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:28,845
Through your sacrifice
you'll be immortal

430
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,878
like Jesus.

431
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:33,964
Telling him a bedtime story, Romeo?

432
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:38,006
Well, just filling in a few holes
in Duane's education.

433
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:42,080
Well, my little intellectuals,
I have one or two holes

434
00:46:42,127 --> 00:46:44,322
that I need filling, myself.

435
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:47,999
This way. Sit down.

436
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:50,677
Sit down!

437
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:56,366
Here, what are you doing?
What do you want?! Leave me alone!

438
00:46:56,407 --> 00:47:00,286
Does it hurt, Estrellita?
Hm, Estrellita.

439
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:04,282
Light of my life,
fire of my heart.

440
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:10,075
I'm not going to do
anything...

441
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:15,880
I hate her!
- I think your friend Duane likes her.

442
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,006
Is he with her?
- I'm afraid so. But don't worry,

443
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:24,040
you're with me.
Romeo will take care of you, mi amor.

444
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:35,246
Put your hands up. Up! Up! Up!

445
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,676
Oh no!

446
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:02,443
Carajo! What the fuck is this?!
- What?

447
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:05,479
It's fake.
- Come on, Estrellita,

448
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:09,520
you don't need it. Leave it.
That's for the putas, Estrellita!

449
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:12,238
Carajo!

450
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:16,518
No!

451
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,918
What are your goals in life, Duane?

452
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:24,003
What?

453
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:32,766
What are your plans for the future?
Come on, Duane, goals.

454
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:37,244
All good American boys have them.
How often have you done this, Duane?

455
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:48,363
Huh?

456
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:53,160
Looks like you start to like me.

457
00:48:54,687 --> 00:48:57,759
I already worried about.

458
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:06,680
Tell me sweets.
At least, I'm a woman.

459
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,519
Oh, my God.

460
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,359
How many times?

461
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:45,878
10?

462
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:47,998
5?

463
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,279
Fuck! Once?

464
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:53,678
Shit.

465
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:57,759
So, how was it?
- I'll never forget.

466
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:05,316
I'll make sure you don't forget,
'cause it'll be the only fuck

467
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:09,360
you'll have in your life.
Time's up, cowboy.

468
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:11,239
Ow!

469
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:15,280
There's no TV here,
but there's something better

470
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:19,081
I want to show you.
Come on. Get up!

471
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:42,680
The two greatest pleasures in life
are fucking and killing.

472
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:17,043
So...

473
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:21,080
I think it should be you who decides
who is going to be sacrificed.

474
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:25,040
You're the sorcerer.
- What about the gringo?

475
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:28,239
You chose him.
- Bullshit!

476
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:32,237
You're the one who started this!

477
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:36,280
You know all you wanted was that
little fucking blonde pussy, anyway.

478
00:51:36,687 --> 00:51:40,077
The poor girl bled a lot, you know.

479
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:43,159
Just like caramel cream.

480
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:48,846
Well, too bad she's not
a virgin anymore, huh?

481
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:52,880
Wouldn't it have been
better for your little ceremony?

482
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:56,084
Yeah that's true.

483
00:51:57,207 --> 00:52:01,166
Why didn't I think
about it before? Shit!

484
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:05,363
Too late now. Anyway, I'm glad we'll
take a trip after the ceremony

485
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:09,400
because they'll be talking about it
for a long, long time.

486
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:15,680
Everything is falling into place.
I'm a lucky man, bonita.

487
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,643
Fuck!

488
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:29,078
If you call me bonita one more
fucking time, I'll fucking kill you!

489
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:41,000
Ok, it's time. The show must begin.
Before anything, I want you to know

490
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:45,006
that it's been a great pleasure
knowing you both.

491
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:49,040
You see, Duane, they'll kill us!
- This can't be happening.

492
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,080
I mean, this can't be happening!
- I'm afraid it is, Duane, cabron.

493
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:57,320
I mean, out there there's a bunch
of people that have come very far

494
00:54:57,367 --> 00:55:02,361
for this and we cannot
let them down. So...

495
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:06,045
one of you will die.
- One? Only one?!

496
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:10,120
Yeah, that's right. Only one. I mean,
Perdita and I haven't decided who.

497
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:14,760
Best if we decide all together.
- What happens to the other one?

498
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:19,280
The other one gets a trip to Miami.
What's this here? A fucking contest?!

499
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:24,280
Ok. Ok. Who votes for Duane?
- I'm sorry, Duane.

500
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:28,286
Estelle, what the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna die.

501
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:32,286
But what about me?
- Relax, cabron. Now you vote.

502
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:36,286
Let's see, whoever thinks, Estelle
should be the one, raise their hand.

503
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:40,280
You son of a bitch!
- You're the only bitch around here.

504
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:44,286
I saw you fucking him!
- He raped me!

505
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:48,286
That's bullshit!
I saw you moving your ass.

506
00:55:48,447 --> 00:55:52,440
After 2 years of playing square,
I've the same right to live as you do!

507
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:56,480
When my father finds out what you've
done he'll chop your balls off!

508
00:55:56,527 --> 00:56:00,281
Your father's a fucking joke!
- Shut up!

509
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:05,241
Ok. Perdita, what do we do now?
- I don't know.

510
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:09,280
After this fucking circus,
I think they both should die.

511
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:14,276
Excuse me,
the people are getting restless.

512
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:18,684
Ok, Adolfo, you decide. Which one?
- The gringa.

513
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:23,246
Who do you think you are?
Romeo, you're not listening to him?

514
00:56:24,607 --> 00:56:27,679
I'm sorry, it's been decided.

515
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:32,680
Don't be scared, Estrellita.
Don't be scared.

516
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:39,000
Tonight, you'll be immortal.
You'll enter in the house of dreams

517
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:43,040
where you'll live forever.
Stop crying, Estrellita!

518
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:50,566
No!

519
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:55,280
I was 10 years old
when they gave me the necklaces.

520
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:59,360
One for each god. Eleguä, Gemayä,
Changö, Obatalä and Ochün.

521
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:08,000
Since then, my necklaces have
protected me from evil.

522
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:13,679
Ache, ache, ache...

523
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:16,999
We live on a river bank.

524
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:19,484
That of the great light.

525
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:23,042
On the other bank
is the great night

526
00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:26,159
where we find force to live!

527
00:57:26,367 --> 00:57:30,042
If we return from the other side,
we'll have power,

528
00:57:30,087 --> 00:57:33,443
power over others,
over our enemies.

529
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:37,566
Somebody help me! Somebody stop him!

530
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,881
We must triumph over those
who would keep us

531
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:45,917
in poverty and sadness!

532
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,157
This is the truth.

533
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:58,006
We must devour our enemies

534
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:01,357
before they devour us.
This is the Pinaldo.

535
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:05,156
The saint's born from death.

536
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:10,759
Don't you want to see Romeo eating
your girlfriend's heart out?

537
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:15,238
Just might turn you on.

538
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:19,846
You're a monster!
How can you do this?!

539
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:23,237
Don't blame me, Guerito!

540
00:58:23,287 --> 00:58:27,280
Don't you remember?
You voted for her, too. Huh?

541
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:35,082
Enjoy the show, sweetheart.

542
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:40,079
You little piece of shit!

543
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:44,076
Do you feel the fucking pain?

544
00:58:48,047 --> 00:58:50,038
Go!

545
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:56,040
See if you fucking like it!

546
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,163
Watch!

547
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:04,359
Only night gives strength
against the light.

548
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:08,286
No sainthood without death.
- Stop it! No!

549
00:59:37,767 --> 00:59:39,837
Romeo!

550
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:32,080
You remember me, honey?
Remember the money we owe Catalina?

551
01:00:32,887 --> 01:00:35,879
Well, forget it. Now it's too late.

552
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:40,079
I bring him your fucking head!
Party's over, Santero!

553
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,639
Bitch! Bitch!

554
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,559
Get off me! He's alive!

555
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:17,644
Where's the other kid?

556
01:01:17,847 --> 01:01:19,838
Duane!

557
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:24,000
Get in the car! Get in!
Come on! Come on! Shit!

558
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:32,480
Are we gonna stay up here looking?
Plenty of them could've died!

559
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:36,526
They're a bunch of fucking killers!
- Hey! Forget about it, Fed!

560
01:01:36,607 --> 01:01:40,520
Remember, we're not here.
- He's right. We can't do anything.

561
01:01:40,607 --> 01:01:44,077
Who's this, a relative or something?
- My sister's boy.

562
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:47,239
Lucky you.

563
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:15,279
Go! Go! Go!

564
01:02:26,887 --> 01:02:31,165
Fuck! No one says anything, or what?
- What the fuck do you want us to say?

565
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:35,246
Don't you wanna know who that was?
- What for? He's fucking dead!

566
01:02:35,287 --> 01:02:39,326
All I want to know is what the fuck
are we gonna do with these two?

567
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:43,485
Give me time, Perdita, ok?
I'm trying to think of something, ok?

568
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:47,600
Stop it, please stop it! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

569
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:57,237
Stop it! Enough! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

570
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:00,597
It's ok. It's ok.

571
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:05,840
The meeting point is in Junction.
There, we will pick up the truck.

572
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:10,439
If we drive all night,
we could get there on time.

573
01:03:10,607 --> 01:03:14,077
We can't be late, Perdita.

574
01:03:22,127 --> 01:03:26,166
What's wrong, Santero?
Did your gods abandon you?

575
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,646
You see? We lost 'em!
- Relax, he's right in front of us.

576
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:40,282
Just can't see him.
If I go any faster,

577
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:44,442
he's gonna see us.
- You sure? He could've disappeared.

578
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:48,076
They say Dolorosa' a nagual.

579
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:52,077
A nagual?
- A supernatural beast

580
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:56,286
that has a human head
and a jaguar's body.

581
01:03:56,327 --> 01:04:00,320
Yeah, and a camel's dick!
- Best of all, he can make himself

582
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:04,360
invisible in front of his enemies.
- Well, that would explain many things.

583
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:08,400
Like how he get across the border?
- Yeah, with two naked and feathered

584
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:12,360
kids in his back seat.
- You must be kidding.

585
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:18,046
You believe that Mexican bullshit?
- The stuff works if you believe in it.

586
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:21,636
You know, one time I saw these guys
crash right into a brick wall 'cause

587
01:04:21,687 --> 01:04:25,680
they thought they could go through.
- And did they?

588
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:29,766
Little pieces went through. The rest
stayed splattered all over the wall.

589
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:35,080
Should it be parked in the middle
of the road with those two inside?

590
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:39,680
Gonna wait.
You don't fuck around with Santos.

591
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:44,359
I promised Reggie I wouldn't.

592
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:47,519
True, you made a promise.

593
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:51,526
And a Spanish gentleman never
breaks his promise, right?

594
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:55,077
Even if it will cost him his life?

595
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:02,082
What do you want? That's how I am.

596
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:07,520
And you? What if I were killed?
Would you cry?

597
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,519
Hey, Skinny? Skinny boy? Hey, what's
are you doing, popsicle dick?

598
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:24,720
Come on, talk to me! Skinny boy?
What's going on? Come on! Come on!

599
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:30,520
I think he has to pee.
- No, man, he wants to suck your dick!

600
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:34,722
Are you a bit nervous, Pete?
- Nervous? What the fuck would I have

601
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:38,760
to be nervous about, cabron?
- Shit, partner! Look at the truck!

602
01:05:39,527 --> 01:05:42,519
You took 6 amphetamines, cafedrine,

603
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:46,685
Korean, American and Siberian
Ginseng, 16 Giant E-zees!

604
01:05:47,327 --> 01:05:50,319
Vitamins to keep me young.

605
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:54,076
Yoo-hoo! What is it now, Mr. Fetus?

606
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,245
There it is!

607
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:03,847
Right on time.

608
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:07,164
Santos knows how to do things right.

609
01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:33,243
Hey, Dolorosa!

610
01:06:33,287 --> 01:06:36,757
Cool.
Dede Paralta, Pete Amendariz.

611
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:40,237
Fuck's up?
- Right smack on time!

612
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:44,237
Mr. Santos will appreciate that.

613
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:48,758
Your instructions. In Las Vegas,
Reggie San Pedro is waiting for you.

614
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:53,280
I know, I know. He's my cousin.
- That doesn't concern me.

615
01:06:53,327 --> 01:06:57,764
Mr. Santos'll be counting on you and I
hope you don't fucking let him down!

616
01:07:08,127 --> 01:07:11,164
Look at you, Skinny, you're frozen!

617
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:16,079
Piece of shit! Ass-munch!
Fucking gringo cocksuckers!

618
01:07:19,727 --> 01:07:23,083
Shut up!
- Go fuck a cactus!

619
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:27,077
Estelle...

620
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:34,676
I think it's the police.
Shh... shh.

621
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:47,079
All right, we got 'em. And those
other 3 assholes work for Santos.

622
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:52,085
We can't go in like this Dumas.
We gotta call in some back-up.

623
01:07:52,687 --> 01:07:56,919
Get off me! Go back to your
fucking crossword puzzle!

624
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:59,766
Come on!

625
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,365
Who's that?
- My woman.

626
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,406
The two in the back? Nephews?
What's this? Fucking family picnic?

627
01:08:08,447 --> 01:08:12,360
Shit! I hate working
with goddamned morons!

628
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:17,763
Fuck!
- Alright, assholes! D.E.A.!

629
01:08:19,487 --> 01:08:23,446
Drop your guns! Put your hands up!
- Fuck you!

630
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:27,440
Son of a bitch!
- Dede, cover me!

631
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:23,441
Shit! Goddamned devil!
Just go ahead and kill me!

632
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:41,877
Skinny!

633
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:46,878
Skinny!

634
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:54,477
Now, you dumbfuck!

635
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:18,077
Shit!

636
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:24,161
Fuck you!

637
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:28,166
Motherfucker!
- Stop the fucking truck!

638
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:31,683
Stop the fucking truck!

639
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:37,076
Your luck has run out, asshole!

640
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:32,757
Charly, take care of this baby.

641
01:11:32,847 --> 01:11:36,078
Yeah. Thank you very much!

642
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:47,239
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Get off me!

643
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:50,757
No, sir, please don't move. Lay down.

644
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:58,078
Lay down, sir!

645
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:26,757
Yeah,

646
01:12:27,367 --> 01:12:31,076
the bambinos. Great, great! Yes.

647
01:12:35,927 --> 01:12:39,886
What do we do now?
- They're all dead. Marcello, Peralta,

648
01:12:39,927 --> 01:12:43,886
Armendariz and fucking Skinny!
- They were all good men.

649
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:48,239
They didn't deserve to die that way.
- Who would have thought that Dolorosa

650
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:52,280
was going to mess everything up?
- He came highly recommended.

651
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:56,320
Seems like D.E.A. Was following
him for a while.

652
01:12:56,807 --> 01:13:01,642
We must act quick to protect the
merchandise. I have to find that man,

653
01:13:01,687 --> 01:13:05,680
what's his name?
- Woody Dumas from Dallas. I know him.

654
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:09,760
He's hurting us so bad.
- Everyone wants to get rid of him.

655
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:13,681
Even his bosses in Dallas.
- Who can we get?

656
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,880
It would be wiser to send an outside
representative to handle the job.

657
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:25,760
Why not send The Fist?
- Yes, Provino Momo The Fist.

658
01:13:25,847 --> 01:13:29,760
I know him well. I'll give him
24 hours to deliver.

659
01:13:29,847 --> 01:13:34,875
And tomorrow, we have one less worry.
- Man, my blessing goes with The Fist,

660
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:38,078
and may God be with him.

661
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:42,685
Girls! Hey!
- What do we do with Romeo Dolorosa?

662
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,239
He's as dangerous as Dumas.

663
01:13:47,287 --> 01:13:50,085
Stop that thief! Call the police!

664
01:14:00,047 --> 01:14:03,084
Hi, pendejos. I hope you like it.

665
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:17,080
The idea of driving 1.000 Miles
with Estrellita makes me ill.

666
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,519
What if I take Duane?
- He can take the car away from you.

667
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:27,085
No. He'll come with me in the truck.
- What if I tie him up?

668
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:31,682
Bad idea. If anyone sees him,
we'll be fucked.

669
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:35,244
So you'll do better with Estrellita.

670
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:46,723
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I only tried it twice, you know,

671
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:50,760
once, in summer before starting Junior
High, I had one of my father's Larks.

672
01:14:50,927 --> 01:14:55,079
I only smoked half and I couldn't do
anymore because I started coughing.

673
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:04,239
The second one was at a party
at my sorority, you know,

674
01:15:04,287 --> 01:15:08,360
one of the student clubs that they
have. Mine was Kappa Gama Epsilon.

675
01:15:08,487 --> 01:15:12,082
This time it was a lot better,
it was sweeter.

676
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:16,039
Look, I know, I know,

677
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:20,080
I'm just talking, and you hat me.
You do hate me, right?

678
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:24,166
I'm sorry. I'm so nervous,
I don't know what to do.

679
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:29,280
I can't help it. Please,
are you ever going to talk to me?

680
01:15:29,807 --> 01:15:32,799
Listen, you little cunt. If you don't
stop breathing down my fucking neck

681
01:15:32,847 --> 01:15:36,840
you won't make it
to he next gas station.

682
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:39,558
Ok?

683
01:15:44,287 --> 01:15:48,280
My Dad used to sing this song to me
when I was a little boy.

684
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:52,806
Are your parents dead?
- They're on vacation in Europe.

685
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:56,675
They won a trip on one of those
TV shows for couples.

686
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:06,760
Was it one of those shows where Mom
tells millions of people

687
01:16:06,807 --> 01:16:10,686
how she does it with Dad?
- They did 8 shows!

688
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:14,680
I mean, it was the worst 2 months
of my entire life!

689
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:19,079
Well, and now this.

690
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:22,923
It's not so bad. You're still alive.

691
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:28,361
Why are memories always so sad?
- Not always. Come on, I remember once,

692
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:33,280
when I was a kid someone brought
movies to Petit Caribe.

693
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:37,083
They showed them in my uncle's barn.

694
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:41,840
There I saw Burt Lancaster for the
first time in the movie 'Veracruz'.

695
01:17:04,247 --> 01:17:07,239
Saint Burt Lancaster, man!

696
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:10,757
He had about 108 giant gleaming teeth.

697
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:36,640
Such a man I wanted to be combined
with the nobility of Gary Cooper.

698
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:45,120
It's a dramatic ending.
It's the perfect ending for a man.

699
01:17:48,527 --> 01:17:51,678
The true path to Sainthood.

700
01:17:52,487 --> 01:17:54,682
Yeah!

701
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:01,400
You're going to kill us when we get
to Las Vegas, aren't you?

702
01:18:01,447 --> 01:18:05,440
Don't make plans. I hate people
who make plans, Duane.

703
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:10,406
Be best if we work things out
as we go along, amigo,

704
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:14,406
don't you think?
- I would appreciate that.

705
01:18:28,013 --> 01:18:31,767
I think we should stay on touch, sir.

706
01:18:33,693 --> 01:18:35,684
Sir?

707
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:21,167
What's this?

708
01:19:22,613 --> 01:19:25,286
Junction to...

709
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:30,285
Las Vegas.

710
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:36,085
Come on! Come on!

711
01:19:47,573 --> 01:19:51,771
Yeah, Doyle! What did you look at
the map with? Your fucking asshole?!

712
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,845
They're going to Vegas. Las Vegas!

713
01:19:54,893 --> 01:19:57,168
Hello? Hello?

714
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,763
Piece of shit phone!

715
01:20:25,293 --> 01:20:29,366
What's that strange sound?
Speak more slowly, sir.

716
01:20:29,453 --> 01:20:32,445
He's out of range.

717
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:50,044
Fuck you!

718
01:21:12,573 --> 01:21:16,566
This is your Captain Romeo Dolorosa
speaking. Welcome aboard.

719
01:21:16,613 --> 01:21:20,606
Please fasten your seatbelts
and try to sleep.

720
01:21:20,773 --> 01:21:23,924
Thank you very much. Fuck you!

721
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:28,052
Ok, guys. I hope to help out
with your little romance.

722
01:21:28,173 --> 01:21:31,051
Don't touch me, ok?
- Estelle.

723
01:21:31,093 --> 01:21:35,132
Look, just fucking go fuck your
Mexican whore you like so much!

724
01:21:40,693 --> 01:21:44,242
Come on, keep cool, Perdita.
Come on.

725
01:21:44,693 --> 01:21:48,686
Never done it in a plane,
how about you?

726
01:22:00,773 --> 01:22:04,163
Pick a card.
- Go to sleep, Romeo.

727
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:08,286
We have a long night ahead us.
- Precisely. Don't you want to know

728
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:12,292
what's going to happen tomorrow?
- I nearly forgot that you're

729
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:16,645
a crazy Santero.
- Every Santero uses his power

730
01:22:16,693 --> 01:22:20,766
to predict the future. Even those of
us who are crazy. Pick a card.

731
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:28,282
Luck. Plenty off luck.
Anyone wanna try?

732
01:22:28,773 --> 01:22:32,766
Come on, Duane.
The cards are sacred. They never lie.

733
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:36,245
Ignore him, he's making fun of us.

734
01:22:36,653 --> 01:22:40,692
They are 18 cards and only
one of them is really bad.

735
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:49,886
But it's not this one.
You're still a lucky guy, man.

736
01:22:51,693 --> 01:22:54,890
And now it's my turn.

737
01:23:06,653 --> 01:23:10,646
Sir, we've spotted a group that fits
their description. They're in

738
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:14,766
a rest-stop just outside of El Paso.
- Follow but do not intercept.

739
01:23:15,053 --> 01:23:19,046
If Dolorosa suspects anything
he's gonna kill those kids.

740
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:23,286
Call our people in Las Vegas. Tell
'em I want to find the warehouse

741
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:27,292
where they store those fetuses.
- That won't be easy, sir.

742
01:23:27,373 --> 01:23:31,366
Start with all the cosmetic labs.
There can't be that many.

743
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:35,406
And tell them move their ass!
Hey, what's red and white

744
01:23:35,453 --> 01:23:39,446
and goes 60 Miles an hour?
A baby in a blender.

745
01:23:53,693 --> 01:23:56,685
Sons of bitches will never find her!

746
01:23:56,733 --> 01:24:00,089
What?
- Once they cross the border,

747
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:03,688
they can't ask for any favors.
- What border?

748
01:24:03,773 --> 01:24:07,766
Mexican. I've to go after her myself.
Even if my wife thinks I'm crazy.

749
01:24:07,813 --> 01:24:11,931
Sometimes it's better not to think so
much. Maybe you should read the paper.

750
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:16,091
No, no, no. That's no relief.

751
01:24:16,173 --> 01:24:19,688
A man's gotta do what
his heart tells him to do.

752
01:24:19,773 --> 01:24:23,846
You understand what I mean?
You can't always be in control.

753
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:43,285
Did you see what I just did?
It wouldn't have happened

754
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:46,689
if you'd been here. Think about it!

755
01:24:56,853 --> 01:24:59,845
Some strange men came asking for you.

756
01:24:59,893 --> 01:25:02,885
We said nothing.

757
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:14,683
They said you owed Catalina money,

758
01:25:15,613 --> 01:25:19,606
but I know they were lying
because I raised you

759
01:25:19,653 --> 01:25:23,692
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

760
01:25:38,293 --> 01:25:42,286
I was not afraid, I have seen
so much, my grandson.

761
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:47,052
Even invisible things.
When you were born I knew

762
01:25:47,093 --> 01:25:51,132
you were special that when you died,
you'd turn into a jaguar

763
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:54,245
and run along Caribbean beaches.

764
01:26:02,693 --> 01:26:06,652
Everything ok?
- This place is like

765
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:10,606
an elephant graveyard.
Why are you awake?

766
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:14,692
Something's burning you inside.
- It's nothing.

767
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:19,605
It's your little girlfriend.

768
01:26:19,693 --> 01:26:23,686
My head is ringing from 12 hours
of uninterrupted teenage bullshit.

769
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:28,603
You're jealous. I like that.

770
01:26:39,693 --> 01:26:42,287
Hey! Hey! Wake up! Wake up!

771
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:46,326
Come her! Come here! Look! Look!
So, it's our chance to escape.

772
01:26:46,413 --> 01:26:50,326
If we find another way out of here,
they'll never find us.

773
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:54,326
Estelle, you're crazy!
- Do you actually like that bitch?

774
01:26:54,493 --> 01:26:58,486
No, I'm trying to keep us alive.
- You're fucking coward!

775
01:26:58,533 --> 01:27:02,446
Second time you've called me that!
- Go ahead and hit me!

776
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:05,684
Deep down, you're just like them!

777
01:27:11,973 --> 01:27:13,691
Ok.

778
01:27:14,933 --> 01:27:16,924
Come on.

779
01:27:18,013 --> 01:27:20,925
I don't see them. Hurry up!

780
01:27:21,013 --> 01:27:22,844
Go!

781
01:27:24,813 --> 01:27:26,724
Go! Go! Go!

782
01:27:26,773 --> 01:27:28,843
Fuck!

783
01:27:29,133 --> 01:27:31,203
Hurry up!

784
01:27:36,973 --> 01:27:40,170
Go! They're behind us!

785
01:27:51,253 --> 01:27:53,767
Faster! Faster!

786
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,772
Faster! Faster!

787
01:28:16,813 --> 01:28:20,931
I thought you were stupid, but it
didn't think you were a traitor!

788
01:28:21,293 --> 01:28:25,286
I don't like traitors, Duane!
I don't like traitors! Understand?

789
01:28:26,693 --> 01:28:30,652
Shit, Duane, I trusted you!
I fucking trusted you,

790
01:28:30,693 --> 01:28:34,652
and this is how you repay me?
I'm going to fuck you over.

791
01:28:34,693 --> 01:28:38,652
I'm gonna kill you, ok?
Do you wanna know how it's gonna end?

792
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:42,686
This is it, man! This is fucking it!
- Oh, God! No, no, no! Please!

793
01:28:42,733 --> 01:28:46,692
It wasn't his fault! It was me!
It won't happen again. It was my idea!

794
01:28:46,733 --> 01:28:49,691
Forget it, Romeo!
- You shut up!

795
01:28:49,773 --> 01:28:53,766
Perhaps we can use him in Las Vegas.
Come on, this could bring us bad luck.

796
01:28:53,853 --> 01:28:57,846
How things changed! Before, you wanted
to shoot them in the desert,

797
01:28:57,893 --> 01:29:01,886
now you're defending them!
- Nobody wants to defend anybody, ok?

798
01:29:03,253 --> 01:29:07,246
This is not the right thing here, now.
- Now I'm the jealous one. Ok, Perdita?

799
01:29:07,293 --> 01:29:11,286
Estelle, what do you think?
Looks like they want to be alone.

800
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:15,246
It wasn't his fault, it was me.
- Fucking asshole!

801
01:29:15,293 --> 01:29:19,286
You decide, Estelle, I finish him off
or I keep him alive to please Perdita.

802
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:23,326
Forget it, Romeo! You're getting
out of hand. Let's get out of here.

803
01:29:25,533 --> 01:29:28,764
Stand up, gringo! Come on, Duane.

804
01:29:30,773 --> 01:29:34,766
How do you do it, man? Some day
you have to tell me your secret.

805
01:29:43,973 --> 01:29:47,090
Understand? You don't beat!

806
01:29:52,813 --> 01:29:56,089
Reggie, my friend. Come in.

807
01:29:57,253 --> 01:29:59,244
Have a seat.

808
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:03,081
You know why you're here?
- I think so, yes.

809
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:06,245
Is that a problem for you?

810
01:30:08,093 --> 01:30:12,086
Ok. I know you're raised up
together in one family.

811
01:30:12,213 --> 01:30:16,206
It takes a pretty long time
when se left Petit Caribe.

812
01:30:16,253 --> 01:30:20,246
I don't object your cousin.
But he did some ugly things.

813
01:30:21,973 --> 01:30:26,091
Even the Mexican Government wants
him to get off.

814
01:30:29,573 --> 01:30:33,691
The Government is after my business.
Several of our associates are dead.

815
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:39,966
Mr. Santos, if I only knew this...
- Don't excuse yourself.

816
01:30:40,013 --> 01:30:42,971
No one is accusing you
of doing anything.

817
01:30:43,013 --> 01:30:47,052
Romeo is doing me a favor
by driving the merchandise

818
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:51,086
for which he'll be compensated.
When the delivery is secure

819
01:30:51,293 --> 01:30:54,763
give him the money we agreed on.

820
01:30:55,973 --> 01:30:58,567
Then kill him.

821
01:30:59,013 --> 01:31:02,164
Money is no good to him, he's dead.

822
01:31:02,253 --> 01:31:05,245
So you take it
for doing me this favor.

823
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,763
That's most generous of you.
- Generous?

824
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:12,324
Just!

825
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:16,526
Treason is merely
a tool of resourcefulness.

826
01:31:17,093 --> 01:31:21,689
I know this will be hard for you
but I firmly believe

827
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:26,045
that man must live his life
according to his own terms

828
01:31:26,093 --> 01:31:30,086
or not live this life at all.
- I'm sure you are right, Mr. Santos.

829
01:31:31,733 --> 01:31:35,692
And I'm sure
you'll do a good job for me.

830
01:31:58,293 --> 01:32:02,286
I figure my little ladies are
wondering where I'm heading.

831
01:32:02,653 --> 01:32:06,612
I'll visit a friend in Nogales.
Estrellita, come with me.

832
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,684
What for?

833
01:32:08,933 --> 01:32:12,767
I'm thinking of selling you.
Get in, pendejo.

834
01:32:12,973 --> 01:32:16,682
Where the hell are you going?

835
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:24,006
I'm going to dance with the devil
under the pale moonlight.

836
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:28,966
Go fuck yourself, Romeo!
- What's wrong? It's from Batman.

837
01:32:29,013 --> 01:32:32,085
Fuck Batman!

838
01:32:47,573 --> 01:32:51,566
One hit, one dollar! You want a hit?
You wanna hit, man?

839
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:54,691
Fuck, yeah!
- One dollar.

840
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:58,732
Here's 10, kick my ass!
- Si, senor, for 10 dollars

841
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:02,686
I make your hair sizzle!
- That's a car battery!

842
01:33:02,773 --> 01:33:06,607
Give it me, motherfucker!
- Very macho, man! Very macho!

843
01:33:06,693 --> 01:33:10,606
Give it to me!
Give it to me, motherfucker!

844
01:33:15,613 --> 01:33:17,683
Oh, fuck!

845
01:33:18,933 --> 01:33:22,084
Electricity is cool, Estrellita.

846
01:33:55,293 --> 01:33:59,252
I'm looking for Catalina.
I heard he is here today.

847
01:33:59,293 --> 01:34:03,286
Catalina. About a debt.
- He's at the back.

848
01:34:30,533 --> 01:34:33,525
Romeo Dolorosa.

849
01:34:33,733 --> 01:34:37,692
Girls, I want you to meet
a real bandido.

850
01:34:37,773 --> 01:34:41,243
Ladies.
- We heard you were doing a job for

851
01:34:41,293 --> 01:34:45,286
Santos with your cousin Reggie.
- Fuck! You keep yourself informed.

852
01:34:46,493 --> 01:34:50,486
You have to keep up with everything
in this business. When you don't know

853
01:34:50,533 --> 01:34:54,526
what's happening, you're dead!
- Listen, Catalina, I'm here

854
01:34:54,573 --> 01:34:57,849
to settle my debt.
I don't like owing anyone anything.

855
01:34:57,893 --> 01:35:00,771
Well, you know that.

856
01:35:00,893 --> 01:35:03,771
Did you hear that, girls?

857
01:35:03,893 --> 01:35:07,886
The son of a bitch says
he doesn't like owing money to anyone.

858
01:35:07,933 --> 01:35:11,243
So you came here to pay me?

859
01:35:11,973 --> 01:35:15,249
Sure. Yeah. And this is half.

860
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:20,326
I'll give you the other half
somewhere were we can talk.

861
01:35:21,293 --> 01:35:25,081
Where did you find this beauty?

862
01:35:25,293 --> 01:35:29,286
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. She's the other half.

863
01:35:33,973 --> 01:35:36,931
Come to my office.

864
01:35:36,973 --> 01:35:39,965
You too, sweetie.

865
01:35:41,293 --> 01:35:44,285
Stay here! Stay here, girls!

866
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:55,971
I don't want any.
- How come? It's pure. Good stuff.

867
01:35:56,013 --> 01:35:59,972
Come on, Catalina, she's not one
of those girls. She hasn't tried

868
01:36:00,013 --> 01:36:04,006
anything stronger than a diet Coke!
- Bullshit, Romeo. Gimme that!

869
01:36:04,053 --> 01:36:07,090
She's terrific. Innocent, clean.

870
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:10,885
And her pussy's pure gold, man!

871
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:15,892
You'll make triple what you make
with those dried-up cunts.

872
01:36:15,933 --> 01:36:19,926
Where did you get her?
- Well, does it matter? We got a deal?

873
01:36:20,933 --> 01:36:24,926
What are you talking about?
- Estrellita, Estrellita,

874
01:36:24,973 --> 01:36:28,966
now this man owns you, ok?
And please don't make me look bad.

875
01:36:29,013 --> 01:36:32,926
You can't be serious.
- You're right. She's great!

876
01:36:33,773 --> 01:36:37,766
Let's toast.
- I hear you visited Petit Caribe?

877
01:36:37,813 --> 01:36:41,692
No, no, no. I had no time.
I sent my associates.

878
01:36:41,853 --> 01:36:45,243
They did a good job.

879
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:49,926
See, I don't like being owed money.
But you learned your lesson now.

880
01:36:49,973 --> 01:36:53,966
You're all paid up. That's it.
Everything is forgotten.

881
01:36:54,693 --> 01:36:58,652
No, Catalina, it's not forgotten.
- Then why the fuck did you come here?

882
01:36:58,693 --> 01:37:01,844
To kill you, pendejo!

883
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:44,165
I'm dead so are you.

884
01:37:44,653 --> 01:37:48,646
Santos will kill you.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

885
01:37:49,293 --> 01:37:53,286
Your cousin sold you out,
you sick fuck! Everyone knows it.

886
01:37:54,293 --> 01:37:57,285
You're lying!
- Reggie's gonna kill you

887
01:37:57,333 --> 01:38:01,326
after you make the delivery.
I'll be waiting for you in hell.

888
01:38:02,853 --> 01:38:06,084
We'll have a great time there.

889
01:38:11,453 --> 01:38:14,684
See you later, amigo.

890
01:38:29,453 --> 01:38:31,444
Remember,

891
01:38:31,493 --> 01:38:35,486
whatever happens, keep smiling, ok.
No long faces. Right?

892
01:38:35,733 --> 01:38:38,770
Nothing happened in here, ok?

893
01:39:29,653 --> 01:39:32,690
Dance! Dance!

894
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:35,084
Dance!

895
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:48,687
Holy shit! He wasted him!
Son of a bitch!

896
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:06,406
You saved my life
back at the airplane junkyard.

897
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:11,851
Thank you.

898
01:40:11,893 --> 01:40:15,886
Don't thank me.
Maybe what awaits you could be worse.

899
01:40:17,293 --> 01:40:21,286
I bet sometimes...
you wish you never met him.

900
01:40:21,653 --> 01:40:23,052
Who?

901
01:40:23,093 --> 01:40:25,084
Romeo.

902
01:40:25,773 --> 01:40:30,449
Listen. There's a lot of people in my
fucking life that I wish I never met

903
01:40:30,493 --> 01:40:34,486
but Romeo is definitely
not one of them, ok?

904
01:40:35,933 --> 01:40:39,926
You ever think about an animal
eating you alive?

905
01:40:40,693 --> 01:40:44,686
I thought Romeo was going to kill me.
- I'm not talking about that.

906
01:40:45,533 --> 01:40:49,526
I'm talking about a wild animal
grabbing you an ripping you apart.

907
01:40:51,813 --> 01:40:55,806
I don't think of things like that.
- That's why you're so boring.

908
01:40:57,853 --> 01:41:01,846
Strangest people come up with
the most interesting ideas, Duane.

909
01:41:02,853 --> 01:41:06,163
I've never met anybody like you.
- I know.

910
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:13,169
Let's go! Let's go!

911
01:41:16,093 --> 01:41:20,132
Why do you follow Romeo? Why don't
you just take off and leave him?

912
01:41:20,173 --> 01:41:24,166
Why don't you just shut up, please?
- Are you in love with him?

913
01:41:28,093 --> 01:41:30,004
In love?

914
01:41:30,053 --> 01:41:34,012
You sound like a fucking
Judith Krantz novel.

915
01:41:34,293 --> 01:41:38,286
I'm just waiting for my money
and then I'll be gone.

916
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:42,163
There won't be any money,
it's a trap.

917
01:41:42,453 --> 01:41:45,684
What the fuck are you talking about?!

918
01:41:45,773 --> 01:41:49,766
I know there's someone named Santos
who wants to kill Romeo in Las Vegas.

919
01:41:49,853 --> 01:41:53,846
A Mexican man told him before dying.
- Don't fuck with me!

920
01:41:55,013 --> 01:41:58,688
What the fuck are you saying?

921
01:41:58,813 --> 01:42:01,805
It's the truth.

922
01:42:03,733 --> 01:42:07,806
What? No, no, no. Forget the cops.
They know less than you and me!

923
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:14,285
Don't cry, sweetie.

924
01:42:14,333 --> 01:42:18,804
How would you feel if I started crying
instead of going out looking for her?

925
01:42:24,573 --> 01:42:26,689
Estelle?!

926
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:40,726
You cannot escape me!
You will be my love slave forever.

927
01:42:45,693 --> 01:42:49,686
Turn it off. All that jumping
is making me nervous.

928
01:42:49,773 --> 01:42:53,732
They jump so much because they have
super powers. Don't you understand?

929
01:42:53,773 --> 01:42:56,685
Here. Cocksuckers!

930
01:42:56,773 --> 01:42:59,845
Who the fuck is that!

931
01:43:01,173 --> 01:43:05,246
They said you grew another arm from
drinking so much Tequila, cabron!

932
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:07,241
Fucking Romeo!

933
01:43:07,293 --> 01:43:11,081
It's been a long time, man!
- A long time.

934
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:16,685
You came here? You need something.
- I do need your help like always, guy.

935
01:43:17,893 --> 01:43:21,886
I want you to meet my friends.
The poor little Duane.

936
01:43:21,933 --> 01:43:25,926
My sad princess Estelle and that's
Perdita Durango.

937
01:43:29,133 --> 01:43:33,126
In the last 48 hours, I've had
2 near-death accidents.

938
01:43:33,693 --> 01:43:38,369
Mexican Mafia tried to shoot at me.
Some fucking animal tried to rip

939
01:43:38,413 --> 01:43:42,406
my fucking head off and I haven't
had breakfast yet.

940
01:43:42,693 --> 01:43:46,686
Please, don't fuck with me today, ok?
All right? Just do you job.

941
01:43:49,373 --> 01:43:53,685
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid to listen
to other people's problems. Hm?

942
01:43:54,613 --> 01:43:59,129
No, you're right! But you are getting
paid to listen to my fucking problems

943
01:43:59,173 --> 01:44:03,166
'cause I'm your boss and I own you,
you little shit! So do your job!

944
01:44:03,253 --> 01:44:07,246
Oh, please, I'm so sorry. We're both
very tired, you understand

945
01:44:07,293 --> 01:44:11,286
I'm also tired! I haven't been shot
at but I've had 2 consecutive shifts

946
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:15,326
sitting in front of the fucking
computer and I wanna go home to sleep!

947
01:44:17,013 --> 01:44:21,006
Yes. Yes, but first...
- There it is!

948
01:44:21,053 --> 01:44:25,046
That's the same fucking list!
- I told you.

949
01:44:25,093 --> 01:44:29,052
Practically every company has some
type of problems with the law.

950
01:44:29,093 --> 01:44:33,086
Fines, toxins, illegal animal trade.
Yes, rhinoceros horns, dog fat...

951
01:44:33,933 --> 01:44:37,926
Shut up with the fucking animals!
Look at this! They're in Tucson

952
01:44:37,973 --> 01:44:41,966
and they're gonna be here in
4 hours... And we have nothing!

953
01:44:42,013 --> 01:44:45,289
Dick! Shit! Nothing!
- I'm sorry.

954
01:44:50,173 --> 01:44:54,166
Ok. Print all the companies that
don't have any violations.

955
01:44:58,333 --> 01:44:59,652
What?

956
01:44:59,693 --> 01:45:03,686
All the companies that don't have
any violations, that are clear. Print!

957
01:45:05,133 --> 01:45:09,092
3 and one of them is still
under construction.

958
01:45:16,453 --> 01:45:20,446
Estelle, what's gotten into you?
- Forgive me for calling you a coward.

959
01:45:23,053 --> 01:45:26,682
Forget it.
- It was to get you to react.

960
01:45:30,053 --> 01:45:33,090
It's ok. Really.

961
01:45:36,173 --> 01:45:40,166
Estelle, they can see us.
- Great, let them see!

962
01:45:40,813 --> 01:45:44,089
Oh, my God!

963
01:45:47,533 --> 01:45:50,764
I can't believe it.
- Come on, Duane.

964
01:45:51,573 --> 01:45:53,245
Estelle. My God!

965
01:45:53,293 --> 01:45:57,172
This might be our last chance
to do it.

966
01:46:06,813 --> 01:46:10,772
Anything wrong?
- No, everything is just dandy.

967
01:46:27,093 --> 01:46:30,051
Did I miss anything?
- Life's a bitch, huh?

968
01:46:30,093 --> 01:46:34,006
That guy just
got hit by a car across the street.

969
01:46:34,213 --> 01:46:38,206
You lose sight for a second...
- Death came as a surprise to him.

970
01:46:39,533 --> 01:46:43,526
There'll be many more surprises
when we arrive to that place.

971
01:46:43,573 --> 01:46:46,770
Well, I don't like surprises.

972
01:46:51,973 --> 01:46:55,170
Hey, you! Everything is ready.

973
01:47:00,013 --> 01:47:03,767
I don't think this is a good idea.
- Don't worry.

974
01:47:04,053 --> 01:47:08,046
They're good people, good friends
of mine. Doug was in Beirut with me.

975
01:47:08,093 --> 01:47:12,006
What did he do, leave his arm there?
- Very funny, Perdita.

976
01:47:12,093 --> 01:47:16,052
I crossed the battlefield with that
arm. It took me hours to get it

977
01:47:16,093 --> 01:47:20,086
to the hospital. I got there too late,
though. It rotted.

978
01:47:22,093 --> 01:47:25,085
Take me with you. Come on!

979
01:47:25,133 --> 01:47:27,727
He only has one fucking arm!

980
01:47:27,773 --> 01:47:29,252
No.

981
01:47:29,293 --> 01:47:33,252
Someone has to take care of
the kids. I don't trust Lilly

982
01:47:33,293 --> 01:47:37,286
and Doug is an ex-marine.
- Don't fuck with me, ok?

983
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:41,531
I don't want you coming, period.
Is that good enough?

984
01:47:41,773 --> 01:47:45,652
A piece of cake, Perdita. Drop the
merchandise, pick up the money,

985
01:47:45,693 --> 01:47:49,686
and that's it. We'll be back before
you notice we're gone.

986
01:48:13,173 --> 01:48:16,643
I don't like
leaving things half done.

987
01:48:16,733 --> 01:48:20,646
I don't want to make my cousin
look bad.

988
01:48:21,773 --> 01:48:24,287
Your cousin?

989
01:48:34,173 --> 01:48:36,164
Fuck!

990
01:48:56,493 --> 01:48:59,690
I wanted to fuck you one more time...

991
01:49:04,013 --> 01:49:07,164
Romeo left these for you.

992
01:49:13,693 --> 01:49:16,890
Where are the keys?
- What keys?

993
01:49:16,933 --> 01:49:19,845
For the handcuffs.
- I have them.

994
01:49:19,893 --> 01:49:21,884
Give 'em to me.

995
01:49:21,933 --> 01:49:25,926
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
My husband said

996
01:49:25,973 --> 01:49:29,886
no one leaves until
he or Romeo return.

997
01:49:30,293 --> 01:49:32,284
Ok.

998
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:36,687
Pick a card.
- What's this? A game?

999
01:49:37,973 --> 01:49:40,965
It's your future.

1000
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:47,087
What does it mean?
- Bad luck.

1001
01:49:49,933 --> 01:49:50,604
Shit!

1002
01:49:50,653 --> 01:49:54,487
Where are we going now?
- Our little trip is over.

1003
01:49:54,533 --> 01:49:58,492
You're letting us go?
- That's right. I can't be driving you

1004
01:49:58,533 --> 01:50:02,526
around all the time, huh?
- You're going after him, aren't you?

1005
01:50:02,973 --> 01:50:06,966
It's your lucky day, sweetheart. Don't
blow it by asking stupid questions.

1006
01:50:07,533 --> 01:50:10,525
Now go! Go!

1007
01:50:12,613 --> 01:50:15,525
Bye, Perdita.

1008
01:50:36,813 --> 01:50:40,886
Doyle, I fucking hate you!
I hate your little TV

1009
01:50:40,933 --> 01:50:44,926
and I hate your glasses
and I hate your stupid fucking tie!

1010
01:50:46,293 --> 01:50:50,172
Did you say something, Sir?
- No, nothing.

1011
01:50:50,293 --> 01:50:54,081
Do you see anything?
- Not a thing, sir.

1012
01:50:54,173 --> 01:50:57,245
Everything's quiet, nothing's moved.

1013
01:50:58,093 --> 01:51:02,052
Motherfucker, you're not gonna have
this job much longer 'cause I'm gonna

1014
01:51:02,093 --> 01:51:06,052
tell 'em put you back in uniform and
right back out on the street.

1015
01:51:06,093 --> 01:51:10,052
As a matter of fact, when I get
through with you, you will guard

1016
01:51:10,093 --> 01:51:14,132
little shopping malls and put the
shopping carts back where they belong.

1017
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:44,286
It's here! The truck! It's here!
- What the heck are you doing?

1018
01:51:45,613 --> 01:51:49,606
Right... Call the station.
And tell them I was right.

1019
01:51:50,013 --> 01:51:53,085
Right away, Sir.

1020
01:52:03,093 --> 01:52:05,084
Fuck it!

1021
01:52:44,173 --> 01:52:46,164
Shit!

1022
01:52:47,453 --> 01:52:50,445
Bayou Chemical Industries.

1023
01:52:50,493 --> 01:52:54,486
Just opposite the Lock Shop
on Nevada Boulevard.

1024
01:52:55,453 --> 01:52:59,412
It's ok, Woody, all on their way.
All the units are on their way.

1025
01:52:59,453 --> 01:53:03,446
Shut up! And don't call me Woody!
'Cause I can't fucking stand it!

1026
01:53:03,573 --> 01:53:06,883
You understand? Don't call me Woody!

1027
01:53:18,453 --> 01:53:22,287
Hey, cousin.
- Hey, man. You've brought our pal.

1028
01:53:22,453 --> 01:53:26,287
Hi, Doug.
- You haven't changed.

1029
01:53:28,013 --> 01:53:32,086
Nothing's changed. Right, Reggie?
- Like always, us three.

1030
01:53:34,253 --> 01:53:37,529
Here's the money. Take it.

1031
01:53:40,453 --> 01:53:42,523
Count it.

1032
01:53:42,613 --> 01:53:45,286
I trust you.

1033
01:53:48,413 --> 01:53:50,404
Shit!

1034
01:54:29,773 --> 01:54:31,206
Fuck!

1035
01:55:04,693 --> 01:55:06,285
Reggie,

1036
01:55:08,093 --> 01:55:12,086
I love you, Reggie.
Why are you doing this to me?

1037
01:55:12,173 --> 01:55:15,688
We are no longer in Petit Caribe,
Romeo.

1038
01:55:16,573 --> 01:55:20,282
I know.
- There's no other way out, man.

1039
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:24,201
It's either you or me. What do you
want me to do?

1040
01:55:24,293 --> 01:55:28,206
There's always another way out,
Reggie.

1041
01:55:35,573 --> 01:55:38,770
Look at me!

1042
01:55:39,373 --> 01:55:42,763
Look at me!

1043
01:56:02,933 --> 01:56:05,003
Oh, Romeo...

1044
01:56:05,733 --> 01:56:07,803
Romeo!

1045
01:56:23,853 --> 01:56:26,287
Hold it!
- Nobody move!

1046
01:57:09,693 --> 01:57:12,685
He's dead.
- Golly gee Mothercrist!

1047
01:57:12,773 --> 01:57:15,765
Look at his teeth!

1048
01:57:19,053 --> 01:57:21,169
Incredible!

1049
01:57:43,893 --> 01:57:46,691
What happend?

1050
01:58:35,253 --> 01:58:37,244
I'm tired.

1051
01:58:41,533 --> 01:58:44,286
I'm so weak.

1052
01:58:46,933 --> 01:58:49,925
And I'm lonely.

1053
01:58:53,173 --> 01:58:56,768
I hurt so much.
I feel it hard to explain.

1054
01:59:00,893 --> 01:59:04,010
I can't trust love.

1055
01:59:04,093 --> 01:59:07,244
Because it won't stay the same.

1056
01:59:08,093 --> 01:59:10,687
Wow! Tired!

1057
01:59:12,373 --> 01:59:15,683
I'm so weak.

1058
01:59:16,413 --> 01:59:19,689
And I'm lonely.

1059
01:59:40,333 --> 01:59:43,689
I need somebody...
