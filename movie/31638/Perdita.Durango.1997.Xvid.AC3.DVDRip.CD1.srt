1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,391
Want another? Sweetie!

2
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,717
Bring me another Bud. And for you?
- What would you like?

3
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,514
Coke.
- Diet?

4
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,713
You fuckin' kidding?

5
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:17,760
You live in Mexico?
- Not exactly.

6
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:22,399
Hey, you heading out somewhere?
- Nowhere now. What about yourself?

7
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:26,278
Phoenix. 4 day software convention.

8
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:29,122
I'm a software salesman.

9
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:33,681
By the way, my name is Manny Flynn.
Half Jewish, half Irish.

10
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:37,440
What's yours?
- Perdita Durango.

11
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:41,445
Ah, that's a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman. Married?

12
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,677
Listen, Manny,

13
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:52,722
you want me to go to Phoenix with you?
You pay me way, you buy my meals.

14
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:56,961
I'll keep your dick
hard for 4 straight days.

15
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,240
While you're at the convention,
I'll do a little business myself.

16
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,283
Plenty of guys there, right?
I show some tit, milk a little cow.

17
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,286
Quick and clean. 50 bucks a pop.

18
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,324
I'll let you keep half of the profit.
How about it?

19
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,523
I gotta go.

20
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,443
Asshole!

21
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:34,725
Hands up! Hands up!

22
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:39,530
You're sisters?

23
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:44,969
Well, I had a sister, too.
Her name was Juana.

24
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:50,290
She had two little girls
that looked just like you.

25
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,091
You wanna see my sister? Yeah?

26
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:57,130
Open it.

27
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,452
That's my sister.
Her husband shot and killed her.

28
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,252
And then he took his gun

29
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,768
pointed to one

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,212
and then the other little girl
and he shot them both in the head.

31
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,696
Bang! Bang!

32
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,657
Thank you.

33
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:57,508
I need a drink.

34
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,953
Please stay behind the line
until you are called forward.

35
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,680
All citizens entering the
United States with goods to declare

36
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,684
please move to the red corridor.

37
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:04,720
Remain in your vehicle until
interviewed by an Officer.

38
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:58,604
Forget it.
- My little virgin,

39
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:02,614
I think today is my lucky day.
- But not mine.

40
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,615
Lo siento, but I'm in a
bad mood today.

41
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:12,330
Come on, everybody needs somebody.
Even woman like you, Srta. Spitfire.

42
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:18,607
My name is Romeo Dolorosa.
My grandma is a witch,

43
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:22,652
my father was a Spaniard,
and I have a Mexican ranch.

44
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,973
Do you wanna come with me?

45
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,653
Well, my name is Perdita Durango

46
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,659
and I don't know shit about my fucking
parents and I don't wanna know shit

47
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,694
about your fucking little ranch.

48
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:44,255
You remind me of someone.
- Yeah? Who, Doris Day?

49
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:49,496
Let me guess.
You're from Hollywood, right?

50
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,576
Probably think you can turn me
into a big star?

51
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:58,061
But by the way you're dressed,
you remind me more of a faggot

52
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:02,178
or an extra in a bad Black
Sabbath video.

53
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,294
I like it.

54
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:10,134
Well, the truth is, I'm a scientist.
- A scientist?

55
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:13,098
No, you're definitely a dentist.

56
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,782
I could tell from that stupid smile
on your face.

57
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:20,787
It's the truth. Science is everything.
Scientists need money,

58
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:25,583
like everyone else. They need funds
to continue their research.

59
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:29,662
So, that's why I'm here
on this side of the border.

60
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,748
I see. Well, you're looking to the
wrong person for a donation. So...

61
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,180
Don't worry.
We have plenty of donations.

62
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,263
Like 12.000 dollars I just received

63
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,745
this morning
from the Morgens Interstate Bank.

64
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,785
Keep quiet! Fucking hell!
I don't want one fucking move!

65
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:50,905
Don't move! Don't fucking move!
- Shut up!

66
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:56,066
If you keep quiet, nothing's
gonna happen, alright?

67
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,787
The money! Quick! Here!

68
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:06,588
Take off your shirt.
Come on, take off your shirt!

69
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:10,710
What the fuck are you doing, man?!
You're crazy!

70
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,748
Come on, show me your titties.
Keep going...

71
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:17,789
The bra... Come on, the bra! The bra!
- What the fuck you doing, man?!

72
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,745
It's not the time!
- Oh, Good Lord!

73
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:25,469
Come here!
- Do you hear me? Let's go! Shit!

74
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:29,193
Sweet mother of God!
Move! Move! Move!

75
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,113
Come on, Romeo! Are you nuts, or what?
Run! Fuck you!

76
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:49,513
Santero psychopath!

77
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:04,082
Ok, thank you very much.
Here you go, the mask of El Santo.

78
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:07,719
It will bring you good luck.
Thank you very much.

79
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:11,758
You had to do it your way!
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

80
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:16,124
It's the last time I'm working
with you, Cabron! Fucking clown!

81
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:20,685
Piece of shit, Santero. He had
to wear that fuckin' little mask,

82
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:24,322
you know, like El Santo.

83
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:29,246
Hey, man, how much did we get?
- I don't know, man! I don't know.

84
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:33,247
Maybe 20.000, maybe more.
- I hope it's more. At least 25.

85
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:37,247
One grand for each and the rest for
the mother-fucking Catalina!

86
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:41,680
Forget about Catalina, Cabron.
- It's scary, man! I'm scared shitless!

87
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,799
Last week, we owed him 20 grand,
and now it's 23!

88
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,203
If we don't pay him soon, he'll kill
us and make a belt with our nipples!

89
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:58,131
Y eso no es funny, no senor.
We shouldn't have borrowed

90
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,801
money from him, I told you,
I told... Romeo?

91
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,443
Romeo!

92
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,204
Fuck!

93
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:15,487
Holy fucking shit!
I'll get you, man! I'll get you!

94
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:29,527
Your luck is running out today, uh?
- Trust science, Perdita.

95
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:33,536
I have different plans of my own.
I get out of here. I'll donate my body

96
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:37,127
to science when I'm dead.
- You don't have to.

97
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:41,211
I already took care of that. Look.
- Are you fucking crazy?

98
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:44,771
C'mon trust in my science, Perdita.

99
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,971
Do you want to cross the border
with me?

100
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,053
So what the fuck are you?
A grave-robber or a bank-robber?

101
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:59,494
I do it all, my love.
I got a really busy schedule today.

102
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:22,613
Your papers, please.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:41,622
Anything to declare?
- Nothing, Officer.

104
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,063
All right. You may continue.
- Thank you.

105
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,625
Trust in science, Perdita.
Trust in science.

106
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:10,825
I come from the island Petit Caribe,
3 Miles long, 1 Mile wide.

107
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:15,431
When I was a kid, there were only
2 cars. And one day, of course,

108
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,828
they crashed.

109
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,632
Sooner or later,
it was bound to happen.

110
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:28,669
It was impossible for it not
to happen. That's how the world turns.

111
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:33,229
That's how you and I met, Perdita.

112
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:15,631
You'll be my Yalocha...
- What?

113
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:19,233
My High Priestess.

114
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:23,794
You can help me with the ritual.
Last night I dreamt about it,

115
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:27,519
I dreamt I was licking your body.

116
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:29,714
Stop! Stop!

117
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:34,637
Did I do this?

118
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,118
What the fuck are you talking about?!

119
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:43,159
I'm a sorcerer, Perdita.
Your Babalou.

120
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:47,440
It's rule of Ocha.
Santeria, my science.

121
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,841
Don't talk shit o me. You don't
believe in those things, do you?

122
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:56,720
I do believe in its power.

123
00:14:57,008 --> 00:15:00,843
You want to see it or are you scared?

124
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,155
I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Why not? It scares evil spirits away.

125
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:35,240
I don't believe in voodoo bullshit.
I doubt if those people did either.

126
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,162
It's not voodoo. It's Santeria.
It's not the same.

127
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,315
Little magical tricks.
Latin bullshit.

128
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:46,357
But it works. You saw it.
- Yeah, but for how long?

129
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:49,601
You know, people are not that stupid.
- Yeah,

130
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:52,762
do you have a better idea, smartass?

131
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,156
Yeah,

132
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,357
you know what?

133
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,676
We should kill someone.
- What?

134
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah, we should kill them
and then we should eat them.

135
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:17,642
Fuck! Like animals, mi amor?
- That's right.

136
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,768
It'll be ingrained
in their brains forever.

137
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,482
Let's do it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow is not good.

138
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,285
I have a date across the border.
- A date?

139
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,730
Son of a bitch.
- It's not what you think.

140
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,691
It's business.

141
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:52,204
Being a kid in Caribe, I spent every
day in the port with my cousin Reggie.

142
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:56,294
There were huge ships, everyone going
to different places.

143
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,573
Panama, Mexico, Hong Kong, Lisboa.
Places that we couldn't imagine.

144
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:07,569
From the moment, I knew I would go
far into the world, beyond Caribe.

145
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:11,049
Yeah? What went wrong?
- What do you mean?

146
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:15,056
This isn't exactly Paris, sweetheart.
- Fuck you!

147
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:19,571
Fuck! I lived in Paris for 2 years,
mademoiselle, and 4 years in Madrid.

148
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:23,375
You know Madrid? Look at this...
Mira, mira. Esto...

149
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,298
I got this from a bull.
I was a bullfighter.

150
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,571
And this is fuckin' souvenir
from Beirut. The Marines!

151
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,613
The greatest travel agency
in this fuckin' wide world.

152
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:42,300
What are you thinking in that
little head of yours?

153
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,573
I'm thinking,

154
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,616
that if we're gonna do a kidnapping,
we should get a gringo.

155
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,861
A guero?
- It'll be impressive.

156
00:20:56,624 --> 00:21:00,299
Adolfo, did you hear that?
- Killing gueros?

157
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:05,498
Fucking hell! Living with you
will be kickass!

158
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:22,186
(Song) Who can turn the world on
with her smile?

159
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:25,504
Coming! Coming! I'm coming!

160
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:31,901
Hello, Mrs. Satisfy.

161
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:35,499
Is Estelle here?
- Of course she is.

162
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,270
Come on in. Come on in. Estelle?

163
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,463
Estelle, honey, Duane's here.

164
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:47,227
Oh, please don't make him wait.
Now, come on down!

165
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,628
Hello, Mr. Satisfy.
- Hi.

166
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:55,223
I'll be down in a second.

167
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:04,388
Estelle! Don't you hear me?
Come down!

168
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:08,588
What is Duane gonna think
of us? Oh, she is the worst!

169
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,189
Duane,

170
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:16,229
in this world, you have to be
in control.

171
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:20,270
It's the only thing that
makes us different from the animals.

172
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:24,276
Absolutely, Mr. Satisfy.
- Ah, you can call me Herb.

173
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:28,436
You know, when we were dating,
Glory Ann always called me Herb

174
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:32,392
after Herb Alpert, the musician.
You know?

175
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,353
The Tijuana Brass, you heard of them,
right?

176
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,511
Well,

177
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,838
not really...
- What is that?

178
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:49,874
It's a free-form mobile, representing
the 4 basic food groups...

179
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:53,153
Here they come.
- Ta-ta-ta-ta!

180
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:55,955
Here she is!

181
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,479
You look beautiful.
- Ok, you two kids.

182
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:03,516
Go out now and have a good time.
- Estelle said you're heading to Susie?

183
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:08,317
Ah, that's where the young ones go
to have fun nowadays?

184
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:12,043
Yeah, well...
- Let's go, Duane, otherwise

185
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:16,078
we might never get out of here.
- Duane, remember what I told you.

186
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,876
(Together) Always be in control!

187
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,440
They haven't arrived yet.

188
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:43,880
No. Where is Perdita?
- Shopping.

189
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:27,895
My, God! Are you alright, Sir?
I could've killed you!

190
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:31,725
Call an ambulance! Call for help!

191
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,014
Alright, alright, alright!

192
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:40,533
Please, stop touching me!
Stop touching me!

193
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:42,610
Shit!

194
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,731
Excuse me, Sir...

195
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:03,732
It's the Holy Bible.

196
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:17,937
You also have a letter.
Is it a secret admirer?

197
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,824
Oh, my God! Is my number one fan.
Is my grandmother Maria Jose, man!

198
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:28,339
I love her! I love that woman.
She always writes o me, man.

199
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:32,541
The oldest woman in Petit Caribe.
I mean, no one knows how old she is.

200
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:36,580
Whatever happened in my country,
she was there to tell the story.

201
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:40,620
She can't write, so she dictates her
letters to my cousin Danny Mestiza.

202
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:43,341
Even when my cousin Reggie and I were
in Beirut, she sent me a letter.

203
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:47,428
We got the money you sent.
Danny says thanks, and so do I.

204
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:54,623
I'm reading the Bible, looking for
the place where you're fighting.

205
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,742
Have you seen the Garden of Eden?

206
00:26:23,794 --> 00:26:26,753
Did you see it?
- What, man?

207
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,827
The Garden of Eden.

208
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:33,909
Of course! Fuck, Adolfo, of course,
man! That's when I saw the Devil.

209
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,669
Garlic sprouted everywhere
he stepped.

210
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:47,790
There they are. Stay put.

211
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,909
Wait.

212
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:12,354
Primo!
- Reggie, man!

213
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,799
Hey, man! I missed you, asshole!

214
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,753
As elegant as ever. How's business?

215
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:25,958
I get by...
- That's over, man, that's over!

216
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:29,753
We're too big for this fucking border.

217
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:34,118
I'm changing your luck, Romeo.
You know Marcelo Santos?

218
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:39,199
Crazy Eyes Santos?
- Don't ever call him that!

219
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:43,279
He hates it. It pisses him off.
- Are you working for him now?

220
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,280
I told you, man, big business.
Big business!

221
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:51,759
Listen. You're my brother. My brother.

222
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:56,758
Mr. Santos wants to meet you.

223
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:01,922
He's here?
- In the car.

224
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:17,649
Mr. Dolorosa.
You like the jabugo ham?

225
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:21,327
It's illegal but delicious.
- Thanks. It's a pleasure

226
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:25,332
meeting you, Mr. Santos.
- I know it's a strange place to meet,

227
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:29,366
but I'm on my way to another business
meeting, and I hate to fly. Drink?

228
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,405
Yeah, thanks.

229
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:35,446
Your cousin Reggie,
he speaks very highly of you.

230
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,488
He tells me you send money back home
to your family. I like that.

231
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:45,172
Well, Reggie and I are very tight,

232
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:48,925
but he might have exaggerated
a little, Mr. Santos.

233
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:53,368
You don't have to be humble with me.
I need someone like you by my side.

234
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:58,091
Here's my proposal. It's very simple.
In 48 hours, a truck will arrive.

235
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:02,972
A refrigerated, semi-trailer truck
loaded with human embryos

236
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:06,571
for the cosmetic industries.

237
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,019
You make a skin cream with fetuses?
- Not a bad idea, although it's not

238
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:15,133
originally mine. You see, the Nazis
made bars of soap out of the Jews.

239
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:21,731
Yeah, and you adapted it to our times?
- More or less. People want to be

240
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:25,741
so beautiful nowadays, hu? You have
to give them that they want.

241
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:29,901
Sure, everyone wants to look younger.
- Anyway, we must get this shipment to

242
00:29:29,943 --> 00:29:33,936
a secret lab in Las Vegas right away.
- Right. You want me to go with Reggie?

243
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,056
No, I have other plans for him.

244
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:41,097
They tell me that you know the area.
Can you do it?

245
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:44,896
Certainly, Mr. Santos.
I'm glad to help.

246
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:48,780
Muy bueno. Now I have 10.000 dollars
for you in old bills.

247
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:53,980
The driver will have an envelope
with your instructions.

248
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:58,106
When you arrive safely in Las Vegas,
your cousin Reggie will give you

249
00:29:58,147 --> 00:30:03,176
another 10.000 dollars. You remember
always, that God and I are with you.

250
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:32,384
Hey, chica! Looking for someone?
- Where the hell did you get that?

251
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,990
I took it from a kid. Get in.
Get in!

252
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:47,588
Ow! You are a clown, you know that?
- A clown with a golden dick.

253
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:49,745
Right.

254
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:53,951
Look, preciosa, look.

255
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:02,190
Yes! You little devil, you!
So your date was with a bank?

256
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:06,231
No, something better. We have to go
on vacation, isn't that great?

257
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:10,511
And when we get there, there'll be
another package like this. Give me!

258
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:18,438
Sounds like a good plan.
- Yes. We'll leave tomorrow night.

259
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:22,917
We've enough time for our little show.
Adolfo is getting ready everything.

260
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,240
I thought with everything that's
going on, I thought you would probably

261
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:31,115
forget about that Santero.
- Forget about it? Are you crazy?

262
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:35,195
It's the only thing I can think about.
Now more than ever. We need a good

263
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:39,156
sacrifice to appease the gods.
- Well, this is the perfect place.

264
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:43,236
There's nothing but little fuckin'
lambs walking around here.

265
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:48,998
We just have to think about doing it.
- It's easy. Just stop someone and say:

266
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:53,078
I'm Palo Mayombe High Priestess.
Mind if I cut your throat and eat

267
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:57,198
your heart? Ok, what should we get?

268
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:00,316
I don't know.

269
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:04,366
How about something blond, tanned,

270
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,398
muscular?

271
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,884
Are you gonna fuck him or eat him?

272
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:13,885
Maybe both.
- Ok.

273
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,205
Here's your man.
- He's no good.

274
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:52,088
What do you mean he's no good?
- From far away he looked different.

275
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:56,093
Esta fuckin' borracho! I hate drunks.
- What do I do with him now?

276
00:32:56,295 --> 00:33:00,208
I don't know. Why don't you lave him
where you found him?

277
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:03,288
Who the hell are you people?

278
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,408
You crazy bitch!

279
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:09,734
Sorry, man. Who understands women?

280
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:14,010
What are you doing?
- Watch, wait and see.

281
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,252
Shut up! Shut up!
Fucking blow your heads off!

282
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:31,732
Come on! Come on!

283
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:54,496
They're gonna kill the kids! They're
the devils! I saw it in their eyes!

284
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:59,537
They're gonna eat them and come
back for more. Fuck all of you!

285
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:07,738
Excuse me, excuse me!
- Shut up! What're you trying to do?

286
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:10,818
Shh, it's ok, shh...

287
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,619
What's going on?

288
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:18,383
Well, if you're figuring on ransoming,
you know,

289
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:22,387
Estelle's father works in an office.
- Shut up! Do you wanna get us killed?!

290
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:26,421
And my father doesn't have any money.
- The world doesn't spin only on money,

291
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:29,427
pinche guero.

292
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,542
Estelle? Is that your name, princess?
I like it. Estrellita,

293
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:37,583
that's what we'll call you.
Estrellita. You like that, Perdita?

294
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,470
What are you going to do to us?
- Nothing you won't like.

295
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:46,470
Show you where the people live.
Be a place to tell about, if you get

296
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:49,788
a chance on the next family picnic.
- Too bad you won't live to tell it.

297
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:53,746
Please let us go!
- She looks like Barbie.

298
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:57,906
You would stick your dick in a fucking
keyhole if you had the opportunity!

299
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:04,751
Listen, I understand that your people

300
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:09,024
have been, you know, oppressed by our
country. Ok?

301
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:13,235
And I feel for you,
you know? I mean, I really do.

302
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:17,269
But it's not our fault.
It's not our fault! Ok?

303
00:35:17,836 --> 00:35:20,749
Well, why?

304
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:27,037
Are you going to kill us?
- Oh, my God!

305
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:31,748
No, we're not going to kill you.
- Ok, ok.

306
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:35,838
It's gonna be worse. What do you
think about Christmas in fucking hell?

307
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,350
Oh, my God!
- Holiday in hell! Holiday!

308
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,433
A fucking happy holiday!
You make it right, sugar!

309
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,633
You're the best. I love you.

310
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:50,914
Come on! Come on! Don't look at me
like that! Come on, cheer up! Fun!

311
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:54,995
Get party, ok? I'm gonna put a song
on I know you're gonna like.

312
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:58,114
Come on, listen to this.

313
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:01,075
It's Herb Alpert!
- And the Tijuana Brass!

314
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:05,077
This can't be happening!
- It's a sign! It's a sign, Perdita!

315
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:09,197
No hay duda, they are the chosen ones!
- Listen, please. Please, please...

316
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:45,682
Please! Help us!
- Hey! See you around, pendejo!

317
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:02,370
Sheriff?
- What now, Fed?

318
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:06,446
Somebody wants to talk to you.
- Does it have to be now?

319
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:10,693
Says he's from the DEA.
- I'll be damned! A big-shot.

320
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:13,686
Ok, gimme 2 minutes.
- Ok.

321
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,854
And shut the door behind you
on your way out, will you?

322
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:22,886
I'm sorry, Vicky.
We'll have to continue this later.

323
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:28,045
See you tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

324
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:32,446
This way, sir.
- Thank you.

325
00:37:32,857 --> 00:37:36,851
How ya doing? Woody Dumas, Special
Agent for the Federal Narcotics

326
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:39,890
Division up there in Dallas.
- Rip Ford. Sit down.

327
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:43,648
Tell me how I can help you.
What happend to you?

328
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,697
Nothing. Sure is hot in here.

329
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:49,692
That's Susie.
- Thank you.

330
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,170
So, are you up to speed
on this operation?

331
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,219
What operation?

332
00:37:56,261 --> 00:38:00,220
I sent you a fax two days ago.
- Oh, yeah, the fax from Dallas.

333
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:04,221
Yeah, I have it here. You're after
that character, what's his name?

334
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:08,215
Romeo Dolorosa.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be

335
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:12,256
a witch doctor, or something.
- Santero, drug dealer,

336
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:16,058
bank robber, scumbag!
- Here it is.

337
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:22,458
I'll reckon he made it through
your ambush in Del Rio.

338
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:26,458
They say he disappeared like a ghost.
- Well, he was lucky.

339
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,299
Could have been magic, right?
Maybe this Romeo has a cloth doll

340
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:35,056
looks just like you,
stuck full of needles.

341
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,625
It says here his hide-out's
in Mexico.

342
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,666
Yeah, he's got a ranch on the border.

343
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:45,866
I don't see how we can help you.
It's outside of our jurisdiction

344
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:49,868
and it's out of your jurisdiction
too, Special Agent Dumas.

345
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:53,909
Yeah, I know it's outside of your
jurisdiction and I know you're busy,

346
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,943
but I followed this guy for quite a
while and I know he works both sides

347
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,870
of the border wherever the money is.
- It's a big border.

348
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:06,662
Yeah, it is. But unfortunately for
you, they're here in Susie 'cause

349
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,705
I just saw her a few hours ago.
- Her? There's a woman involved, too?

350
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:15,746
Perdita Durango. She's as dangerous
as he is, maybe more.

351
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:20,593
This woman that you say you saw
has she done anything illegal

352
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:24,593
in the State of Texas?
- It's not gonna take her long

353
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:28,594
to break the law.
- Sheriff Ford speaking. Yeah.

354
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:34,309
2 college kids you say? You're sure?
Ok. Yeah, we're coming right away.

355
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:39,390
Yeah, thanks for calling, Phil.
- You know, Ava Gardner.

356
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:43,066
I always loved her lips.

357
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,400
Welcome to Negrita Infante!

358
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:11,074
What's the plan, Romeo?
- Forget about the plan, Adolfo.

359
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:15,315
The future has already been written.
- Cool.

360
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:19,356
You're the boss!
- No, you're the boss!

361
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,555
You're the boss!
- I say you are the boss!

362
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:24,879
Your're...

363
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:28,876
What's wrong with him?

364
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:32,884
This is crazy! Oh, my God!
Where are we!

365
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:37,881
Looks like another planet.

366
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:41,078
This cannot be happening to me!

367
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:45,160
Sleep a little, senorita.
- Please let me go!

368
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:49,166
Don't you know they'll kill us?
- I know nothing, senorita.

369
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:53,241
What? You're with them! Look,
I have 40 dollars and a VISA card.

370
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:57,882
If you let me go,
I'll give you my number.

371
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:02,159
Ok. I'll give it to you now.
It's 7-4-7-0.

372
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,762
You want a blanket?
- Say something!

373
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,922
You want a blanket?
- Why are you doing this to me?

374
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,964
You wanna kill us, too? Is that it?

375
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,203
Fuck!

376
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:46,570
I want to share something with you,
Duane.

377
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:50,974
It's my treasure.

378
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,971
A sticker collection?
It looks interesting.

379
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:20,490
Interesting?!

380
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:24,219
Duane,
when I first saw these drawings,

381
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:28,221
I started looking for answers
to the big questions in life!

382
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:31,892
What the fuck are we doing here,
Duane?

383
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,222
Why do we need to eat?

384
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,264
Why do we need to fuck
or watch TV? Tell me.

385
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:45,264
Do you understand what I'm saying?

386
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:52,499
You're not one of those kids who doesn't
believe in anything? Are you, Duane?

387
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,263
No,

388
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:58,504
I believe in a superior energy.

389
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:01,899
Energy?! Energy?! Fuck energy, Duane!

390
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:06,101
No, no, no! Don't start with
that hippie bullshit, ok?

391
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:10,108
I'm talking about Gods!
Gods creators of fucking universes!

392
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,906
Ok. Ok, all right. I believe, ok?
- Good.

393
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,982
God!

394
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:32,107
So Goldilocks wants to be a hero?
- Shut up!

395
00:43:39,073 --> 00:43:43,067
I expected you to be a stupid-ass
white girl that depends on daddy.

396
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:47,108
I bet your biggest hope is to marry
some cocksucking cowboy, pump out

397
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:51,148
2 blond kids perpetuating the cycle
endlessly. Isn't that right?

398
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:59,155
Give me the gun.
- I don't know what this is about,

399
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:03,110
but I do not wanna die!
- Ok, then kill me.

400
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:05,713
Go ahead, shoot!

401
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:09,711
But if you miss...
- I know how to shoot a gun!

402
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,673
Really?
I'll give you piece of advice.

403
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,758
I don't need your advice.
- Lf you really wanna do something,

404
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:21,759
do it without thinking about. That's
the difference between you and me.

405
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,039
I would have killed you long time ago.
- For instance the Aztecs,

406
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:31,075
the old inhabitants of this land.
This people had this all figured out

407
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:35,081
thousands of years before
you and I were born, Duane.

408
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:38,354
See this guy? It's me.

409
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:41,515
And this here is you.

410
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:44,361
Food for the Gods.

411
00:44:44,523 --> 00:44:48,119
How many men have you fucked?
None?

412
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:51,522
I can't believe it.
You're still a virgin?

413
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:55,918
It's written all over your face.
It's ok. We've all been there.

414
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:01,119
Come on, this is stupid.
Gimme the gun.

415
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:04,000
That's good.

416
00:45:10,928 --> 00:45:14,921
You know what they did to me at
school when I misbehaved?

417
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:18,518
They would whack my hands
with a ruler.

418
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,527
Kiss my feet! Come on!

419
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:35,882
Good girl.

420
00:45:35,931 --> 00:45:39,845
You have to die to live.
- Oh, my God.

421
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:42,123
Exactly.

422
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:45,924
Think of Jesus Christ.

423
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:52,767
Why are millions of people coming
together each Sunday

424
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,931
and drink his blood?

425
00:46:02,535 --> 00:46:04,766
Tell me...

426
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:09,129
didn't you know that one has to
sacrify to the Gods?

427
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:17,928
People forgot their religion.

428
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:22,371
I envy you, really.

429
00:46:22,419 --> 00:46:26,697
Through your sacrifice
you'll be immortal

430
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:28,730
like Jesus.

431
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,817
Telling him a bedtime story, Romeo?

432
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,860
Well, just filling in a few holes
in Duane's education.

433
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:39,934
Well, my little intellectuals,
I have one or two holes

434
00:46:39,981 --> 00:46:42,177
that I need filling, myself.

435
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:45,854
This way. Sit down.

436
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:48,533
Sit down!

437
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:54,222
Here, what are you doing?
What do you want?! Leave me alone!

438
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:58,143
Does it hurt, Estrellita?
Hm, Estrellita.

439
00:46:58,544 --> 00:47:02,140
Light of my life,
fire of my heart.

440
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:07,934
I'm not going to do
anything...

441
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:13,739
I hate her!
- I think your friend Duane likes her.

442
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:17,866
Is he with her?
- I'm afraid so. But don't worry,

443
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:21,901
you're with me.
Romeo will take care of you, mi amor.

444
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:33,108
Put your hands up. Up! Up! Up!

445
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,540
Oh no!

446
00:47:56,953 --> 00:48:00,310
Carajo! What the fuck is this?!
- What?

447
00:48:00,354 --> 00:48:03,346
It's fake.
- Come on, Estrellita,

448
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:07,388
you don't need it. Leave it.
That's for the putas, Estrellita!

449
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:10,106
Carajo!

450
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:14,387
No!

451
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:19,788
What are your goals in life, Duane?

452
00:48:19,837 --> 00:48:21,873
What?

453
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:30,637
What are your plans for the future?
Come on, Duane, goals.

454
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:35,116
All good American boys have them.
How often have you done this, Duane?

455
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,237
Huh?

456
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:51,034
Looks like you start to like me.

457
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,634
I already worried about.

458
00:49:00,643 --> 00:49:04,556
Tell me sweets.
At least, I'm a woman.

459
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,399
Oh, my God.

460
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:41,241
How many times?

461
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:43,761
10?

462
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,881
5?

463
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,162
Fuck! Once?

464
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,562
Shit.

465
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:55,643
So, how was it?
- I'll never forget.

466
00:49:59,572 --> 00:50:03,201
I'll make sure you don't forget,
'cause it'll be the only fuck

467
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:07,246
you'll have in your life.
Time's up, cowboy.

468
00:50:07,453 --> 00:50:09,125
Ow!

469
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:13,167
There's no TV here,
but there's something better

470
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:16,969
I want to show you.
Come on. Get up!

471
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:40,571
The two greatest pleasures in life
are fucking and killing.

472
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:14,940
So...

473
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:18,977
I think it should be you who decides
who is going to be sacrificed.

474
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:22,938
You're the sorcerer.
- What about the gringo?

475
00:51:23,065 --> 00:51:26,137
You chose him.
- Bullshit!

476
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:30,136
You're the one who started this!

477
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:34,179
You know all you wanted was that
little fucking blonde pussy, anyway.

478
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:37,977
The poor girl bled a lot, you know.

479
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:41,060
Just like caramel cream.

480
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:46,747
Well, too bad she's not
a virgin anymore, huh?

481
00:51:46,868 --> 00:51:50,782
Wouldn't it have been
better for your little ceremony?

482
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:53,987
Yeah that's true.

483
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,069
Why didn't I think
about it before? Shit!

484
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,267
Too late now. Anyway, I'm glad we'll
take a trip after the ceremony

485
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:07,305
because they'll be talking about it
for a long, long time.

486
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:13,586
Everything is falling into place.
I'm a lucky man, bonita.

487
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:22,550
Fuck!

488
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:26,986
If you call me bonita one more
fucking time, I'll fucking kill you!

489
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:38,928
Ok, it's time. The show must begin.
Before anything, I want you to know

490
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,935
that it's been a great pleasure
knowing you both.

491
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:46,969
You see, Duane, they'll kill us!
- This can't be happening.

492
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:51,010
I mean, this can't be happening!
- I'm afraid it is, Duane, Cabron.

493
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:55,250
I mean, out there there's a bunch
of people that have come very far

494
00:54:55,297 --> 00:55:00,292
for this and we cannot
let them down. So...

495
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:03,977
one of you will die.
- One? Only one?!

496
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:08,052
Yeah, that's right. Only one. I mean,
Perdita and I haven't decided who.

497
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,693
Best if we decide all together.
- What happens to the other one?

498
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,214
The other one gets a trip to Miami.
What's this here? A fucking contest?!

499
00:55:18,221 --> 00:55:22,215
Ok. Ok. Who votes for Duane?
- I'm sorry, Duane.

500
00:55:22,262 --> 00:55:26,221
Estelle, what the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna die.

501
00:55:26,262 --> 00:55:30,222
But what about me?
- Relax, Cabron. Now you vote.

502
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:34,222
Let's see, whoever thinks, Estelle
should be the one, raise their hand.

503
00:55:34,303 --> 00:55:38,217
You son of a bitch!
- You're the only bitch around here.

504
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:42,224
I saw you fucking him!
- He raped me!

505
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:46,224
That's bullshit!
I saw you moving your ass.

506
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,379
After 2 years of playing square,
I've the same right to live as you do!

507
00:55:50,426 --> 00:55:54,420
When my father finds out what you've
done he'll chop your balls off!

508
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:58,221
Your father's a fucking joke!
- Shut up!

509
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:03,182
Ok. Perdita, what do we do now?
- I don't know.

510
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:07,221
After this fucking circus,
I think they both should die.

511
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:12,218
Excuse me,
the people are getting restless.

512
00:56:13,509 --> 00:56:16,627
Ok, Adolfo, you decide. Which one?
- The gringa.

513
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,190
Who do you think you are?
Romeo, you're not listening to him?

514
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:25,623
I'm sorry, it's been decided.

515
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:30,625
Don't be scared, Estrellita.
Don't be scared.

516
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:36,946
Tonight, you'll be immortal.
You'll enter in the house of dreams

517
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:40,987
where you'll live forever.
Stop crying, Estrellita!

518
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,514
No!

519
00:56:49,235 --> 00:56:53,229
I was 10 years old
when they gave me the necklaces.

520
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:57,309
One for each god. Eleguä, Gemayä,
Changö, Obatalä and Ochün.

521
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:05,951
Since then, my necklaces have
protected me from evil.

522
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:11,630
Ache, ache, ache...

523
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:14,951
We live on a river bank.

524
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,436
That of the great light.

525
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:20,995
On the other bank
is the great night

526
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,112
where we find force to live!

527
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,996
If we return from the other side,
we'll have power,

528
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:31,397
power over others,
over our enemies.

529
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,521
Somebody help me! Somebody stop him!

530
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:39,837
We must triumph over those
who would keep us

531
00:57:40,483 --> 00:57:43,873
in poverty and sadness!

532
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:53,115
This is the truth.

533
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:55,964
We must devour our enemies

534
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:59,316
before they devour us.
This is the Pinaldo.

535
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:03,115
The saint's born from death.

536
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:08,719
Don't you want to see Romeo eating
your girlfriend's heart out?

537
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:13,199
Just might turn you on.

538
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:17,808
You're a monster!
How can you do this?!

539
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:21,199
Don't blame me, guerito!

540
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:25,243
Don't you remember?
You voted for her, too. Huh?

541
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,046
Enjoy the show, sweetheart.

542
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:38,044
You little piece of shit!

543
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:42,041
Do you feel the fucking pain?

544
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:48,004
Go!

545
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:54,007
See if you fucking like it!

546
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:56,130
Watch!

547
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,327
Only night gives strength
against the light.

548
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:06,255
No sainthood without death.
- Stop it! No!

549
00:59:35,741 --> 00:59:37,811
Romeo!

550
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:30,062
You remember me, honey?
Remember the money we owe Catalina?

551
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:33,862
Well, forget it. Now it's too late.

552
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:38,062
I bring him your fucking head!
Party's over, santero!

553
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:44,623
Bitch! Bitch!

554
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:12,547
Get off me! He's alive!

555
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:15,633
Where's the other kid?

556
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:17,827
Duane!

557
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:21,990
Get in the car! Get in!
Come on! Come on! Shit!

558
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:30,471
Are we gonna stay up here looking?
Plenty of them could've died!

559
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:34,518
They're a bunch of fucking killers!
- Hey! Forget about it, Fed!

560
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:38,512
Remember, we're not here.
- He's right. We can't do anything.

561
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:42,070
Who's this, a relative or something?
- My sister's boy.

562
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,232
Lucky you.

563
01:02:10,284 --> 01:02:13,277
Go! Go! Go!

564
01:02:24,887 --> 01:02:29,165
Fuck! No one says anything, or what?
- What the fuck do you want us to say?

565
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:33,247
Don't you wanna know who that was?
- What for? He's fucking dead!

566
01:02:33,288 --> 01:02:37,328
All I want to know is what the fuck
are we gonna do with these two?

567
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:41,487
Give me time, Perdita, ok?
I'm trying to think of something, ok?

568
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:45,603
Stop it, please stop it! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

569
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:55,241
Stop it! Enough! Stop it!
- Shut up! Shut up!

570
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:58,602
It's ok. It's ok.

571
01:02:59,852 --> 01:03:03,846
The meeting point is in Junction.
There, we will pick up the truck.

572
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:08,445
If we drive all night,
we could get there on time.

573
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:12,084
We can't be late, Perdita.

574
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:24,175
What's wrong, santero?
Did your gods abandon you?

575
01:03:30,617 --> 01:03:34,656
You see? We lost 'em!
- Relax, he's right in front of us.

576
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:38,293
Just can't see him.
If I go any faster,

577
01:03:38,778 --> 01:03:42,454
he's gonna see us.
- You sure? He could've disappeared.

578
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:46,088
They say Dolorosa' a nagual.

579
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:50,090
A nagual?
- A supernatural beast

580
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,299
that has a human head
and a jaguar's body.

581
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,334
Yeah, and a camel's dick!
- Best of all, he can make himself

582
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:02,375
invisible in front of his enemies.
- Well, that would explain many things.

583
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:06,415
Like how he get across the border?
- Yeah, with two naked and feathered

584
01:04:06,462 --> 01:04:10,376
kids in his back seat.
- You must be kidding.

585
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:16,063
You believe that Mexican bullshit?
- The stuff works if you believe in it.

586
01:04:16,104 --> 01:04:19,653
You know, one time I saw these guys
crash right into a brick wall 'cause

587
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:23,698
they thought they could go through.
- And did they?

588
01:04:23,745 --> 01:04:27,785
Little pieces went through. The rest
stayed splattered all over the wall.

589
01:04:29,026 --> 01:04:33,099
Should it be parked in the middle
of the road with those two inside?

590
01:04:33,706 --> 01:04:37,700
Gonna wait.
You don't fuck around with Santos.

591
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:42,380
I promised Reggie I wouldn't.

592
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:45,540
True, you made a promise.

593
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:49,548
And a Spanish gentleman never
breaks his promise, right?

594
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:53,099
Even if it will cost him his life?

595
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:00,105
What do you want? That's how I am.

596
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:05,544
And you? What if I were killed?
Would you cry?

597
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:18,545
Hey, Skinny? Skinny boy? Hey, what's
are you doing, popsicle dick?

598
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:22,747
Come on, talk to me! Skinny boy?
What's going on? Come on! Come on!

599
01:05:24,474 --> 01:05:28,548
I think he has to pee.
- No, man, he wants to suck your dick!

600
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:32,751
Are you a bit nervous, Pete?
- Nervous? What the fuck would I have

601
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:36,789
to be nervous about, Cabron?
- Shit, partner! Look at the truck!

602
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:40,549
You took 6 amphetamines, cafedrine,

603
01:05:40,597 --> 01:05:44,715
Korean, American and Siberian
Ginseng, 16 Giant E-zees!

604
01:05:45,357 --> 01:05:48,350
Vitamins to keep me young.

605
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:52,107
Yoo-hoo! What is it now, Mr. Fetus?

606
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,278
There it is!

607
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,880
Right on time.

608
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,197
Santos knows how to do things right.

609
01:06:29,255 --> 01:06:31,371
Hey, Dolorosa!

610
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:34,885
Cool.
Dede Paralta, Pete Amendariz.

611
01:06:35,055 --> 01:06:38,365
Fuck's up?
- Right smack on time!

612
01:06:39,055 --> 01:06:42,365
Mr. Santos will appreciate that.

613
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:46,886
Your instructions. In Las Vegas,
Reggie San Pedro is waiting for you.

614
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:51,408
I know, I know. He's my cousin.
- That doesn't concern me.

615
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:55,892
Mr. Santos'll be counting on you and I
hope you don't fucking let him down!
