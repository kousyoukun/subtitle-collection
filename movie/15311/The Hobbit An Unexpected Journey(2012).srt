1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:09,545


4
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,656
片名: 霍比特人

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,608
亲爱的弗罗多
My dear Frodo:

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,531
你曾问过我...
You asked me once...

7
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,411
我是不是把全部探险经历都告诉你了
if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures.

8
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,704
我只能说...
And while I can honestly...

9
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,997
我告诉了你...
say I have told you...

10
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,373
真相...
the truth...

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,877
但不是全部
I may not have told you all of it.

12
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,970
我老了 弗罗多
I am old now, Frodo.

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,225
不再是曾经那个霍比特人了
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.

14
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,479
是时候...
I think...

15
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,689
让你知道...
it is time for you to know...

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,860
全部真相了
what really happened.

17
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,822
故事...
It began...

18
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,824
始于很久前...
long ago...

19
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,078
在遥远的东方...
in a land far away to the east...

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,291
现在已无处寻觅
the like of which you will not find in the world today.

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,095
有一座河谷镇
There was the city of Dale.

22
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,097
城里有知名的...
Its markets known...

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,390
大型市场
far and wide.

24
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,893
到处都是藤蔓和溪谷
Full of the bounties of vine and vale.

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,605
祥和富足
Peaceful and prosperous.

26
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,235
因为这座城市...
For this city lay before the doors...

27
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,321
横亘在中土最伟大的王国门外
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,448
伊鲁柏
Erebor.

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,701
最强大的...
Stronghold of Thror...

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,830
山下之王索尔...
King Under the Mountain. Mightiest...

31
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,957
的矮人王国
of the Dwarf Lords.

32
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,711
索尔有着绝对的统治权...
Thror ruled with utter surety...

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,338
从没有人质疑他王权的延续...
never doubting his house would endure...

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,798
因为他的统治...
for his line lay secure...

35
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,800
有他儿子...
in the lives of his son...

36
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,636
还有孙子来继承
and grandson.

37
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,016
啊 弗罗多 说到伊鲁柏
Ah, Frodo. Erebor.

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,476
它建在山脉内部...
Built deep within the mountain itself...

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,813
是座传奇般美丽的要塞
the beauty of this fortress city was legend.

40
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,941
它的财富埋藏在地下...
Its wealth lay in the earth...

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,985
岩石中随处可见宝石...
in precious gems hewn...

42
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,197
黄金像河水一样奔流...
from rock and in great seams of gold...

43
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,658
储量丰富
running like rivers through stone.

44
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,871
矮人们加工钻石 祖母绿...
The skill of the Dwarves...

45
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,874
红宝石 蓝宝石的技艺..
was unequaled, fashioning objects...

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,791
如同美人的饰物般...
of great beauty...

47
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,963
精湛得无与伦比
out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.

48
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,799
越挖越深...
Ever they delved deeper...

49
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,801
深入黑暗
down into the dark.

50
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,138
然后 在那里 发现了它
And that is where they found it.

51
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,396
山脉之心
The Heart of the Mountain.

52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,525
阿肯宝石
The Arkenstone.

53
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,238
索尔取名为"国王的珠宝"
Thror named it "The King's Jewel. "

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,407
他把它当做一种象征...
He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule...

55
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,284
天赐统治权的象征
was divine.

56
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,702
所有人...
All would pay...

57
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,995
都要向他表示尊敬
homage to him.

58
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,247
包括伟大的...
Even the great...

59
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,916
精灵王 瑟兰督伊
Elven King, Thranduil.

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,006
随着矮人们的财富增长...
As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew...

61
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,136
他们的良知却日渐淡薄
their store of good will ran thin.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,392
没有人知道争议究竟因何而起
No one knows exactly what began the rift.

63
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,604
精灵们说...
The Elves say...

64
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,897
是矮人们偷了他们的宝藏
the Dwarves stole their treasure.

65
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,942
矮人们则另有论断
The Dwarves tell another tale.

66
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,405
他们说是因为精灵王拒绝支付报酬
They say the Elf King refused to give them their rightful pay.

67
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,907
很可悲 弗罗多 长久的联盟...
It is sad, Frodo, how old alliances...

68
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,075
为何会分裂
can be broken.

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,578
人们之间的友谊会灭失
How friendships between peoples can be lost.

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,248
为何会灭失?
And for what?

71
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,510
渐渐的 日子不再好过...
Slowly the days turned sour...

72
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,138
暗夜即将来临
and the watchful nights closed in.

73
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,649
索尔对黄金的痴迷...
Thror's love of gold...

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,027
走火入魔
had grown too fierce.

75
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,948
他产生了邪念
A sickness had begun to grow within him.

76
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,910
那是心灵的邪念
It was a sickness of the mind.

77
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,499
而邪念滋生之处...
And where sickness thrives...

78
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,586
罪恶也随之而来
bad things will follow.

79
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,847
首先大家听到了...
The first they heard was a noise...

80
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,724
像飓风一样的声音...
like a hurricane coming down...

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,933
从北方袭来
from the North.

82
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,478
山丘上的松树...
The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked...

83
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,272
在炎热干燥的风中吱嘎碎裂
in the hot, dry wind.

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,653
巴林 发警报
Balin, sound the alarm.

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,408
召集守卫 快!
Call out the guard. Do it now!

86
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,077
怎么回事?
What is it?

87
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,870
龙
Dragon.

88
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,705
龙!
Dragon!

89
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,542
那是...
He was...

90
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,960
北方来的火龙
a firedrake from the North.

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,928
史矛革...
Smaug...

92
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,805
来了
had come.

93
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,297
那天死者...
Such wanton death...

94
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,674
不计其数
was dealt that day.

95
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,719
史矛革视人族城镇...
For this city of Men was nothing...

96
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,637
为无物
to Smaug.

97
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,764
他...
His eye...

98
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,809
另有目标
was set on another prize.

99
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,523
因为龙...
For dragons...

100
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,024
对黄金...
covet gold...

101
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,526
有非常狂热的...
with a dark and...

102
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,528
贪念
fierce desire.

103
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,056
啊!
Aah!

104
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,187
不!
No!

105
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,486
走啊
Come on.

106
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,323
伊鲁柏失陷
Erebor was lost.

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,786
因为龙...
For a dragon...

108
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,830
会守卫他的战利品...
will guard his plunder...

109
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,249
不死不离
as long as he lives.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,260
逃命去吧!
Run for your lives!

111
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,138
啊! 帮帮我们!
Ah! Help us!

112
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,820
瑟兰督伊不会让自己的族人...
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against...

113
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,572
冒性命之险去对抗龙的残暴
the wrath of the dragon.

114
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,991
那天精灵方未施援手...
No help came from the Elves...

115
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,620
从那以后再也没有
that day, nor any day since.

116
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,958
被赶出了自己的家乡...
Robbed of their homeland...

117
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,878
伊鲁柏的矮人们流离失所...
the Dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness...

118
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,382
曾经高傲的人们陷入困境
a once mighty people brought low.

119
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,137
年轻的矮人王子竭尽所能...
The young Dwarf prince took work where he could find it...

120
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,640
在人族村庄中劳作
laboring in the villages of Men.

121
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,351
但他一直没有忘记...
But always he remembered...

122
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,979
月下的山丘升起的黑烟...
the mountain smoke beneath the moon...

123
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,399
树木像火把一样燃炽
the trees like torches blazing bright.

124
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,150
因为他目睹了...
For he had seen dragon fire...

125
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,902
漫天的龙火...
in the sky...

126
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,488
将一座城市变为灰烬
and a city turned to ash.

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,659
他永远不会原谅...
And he never forgave...

128
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,786
也永远不会忘记
and he never forgot.

129
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,500
而在远方 在世界的另一个角落...
Far away, in another corner of the world...

130
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,459
龙只是...
dragons were...

131
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,460
存在于传说中
only make-believe.

132
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,503
飞上去喽!
Up they go!

133
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,504
在仲夏夜的聚会上...
A party trick...

134
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,755
由巫师变出来的...
conjured by Wizards...

135
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,798
魔术里
on Midsummer's Eve.

136
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,341
还不如魔法仙尘...
No more frightening...

137
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,634
可怕
than fairy dust.

138
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,138
比尔博!
Bilbo!

139
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,599
而我 亲爱的弗罗多...
And that, my dear Frodo...

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,558
就此参与了这段传奇
is where I come in.

141
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,477
比尔博! 比尔博
Bilbo! Bilbo.

142
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,564
一段伴随了我一辈子却有些意外的友谊...
It was the beginning of an unlikely friendship...

143
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,735
就是那样开始的
that has lasted all my life.

144
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,534
而并不是我故事真正的开始 对我来说 应该从...
But it is not the start of my story. For me, it began...

145
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,995
刚开始 可能跟你期待的一样
Well, it began as you might expect.

146
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,875
地上的洞穴里 住着一个...
In a hole in the ground, there lived...

147
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,543
霍比特人
a Hobbit.

148
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,717
并不是杂乱 肮脏 充满怪味和虫子的潮湿洞穴
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole full of worms and oozy smells.

149
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,802
是个霍比特式洞穴
This was a Hobbit hole.

150
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,474
那就意味着高品质的食物 温暖的壁炉...
And that means good food, a warm hearth...

151
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,686
以及一切组成家的舒适条件
and all the comforts of home.

152
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,223
谢谢
Thank you.

153
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,475
这是什么?
What's this?

154
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,851
这是私人物品
That is private.

155
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,603
把你的手爪子拿开
Keep your sticky paws off.

156
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,148
还没准备好呢
It's not ready yet.

157
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,858
准备做什么?
Not ready for what?

158
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
给人看
Reading.

159
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,324
这些到底都是什么?
What on earth are these?

160
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,368
对聚会邀请函的回复
Replies to the party invitations.

161
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,164
啊 太好了 是今天吗?
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

162
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,749
他们都说会来
They all say they're coming.

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,753
除了塞克维尔巴金斯一家 他们要求你单独邀请
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses, who are demanding you ask them in person.

164
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,423
是吗 真的? 等我...
Are they, indeed? Over my...

165
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,466
- 死了吧  - 他们可能认为...
- dead body.  - They'd probably find that...

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,551
这样是可以的
quite agreeable.

167
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,928
他们好像认为你有些地道满藏着金子
They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.

168
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,807
只有一个小箱子 根本没满
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

169
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,560
还带着食人妖的味道
And it still smells of Troll.

170
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,603
你究竟在干什么?
What on earth are you doing?

171
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,526
预防措施 其实...
Taking precautions. You know...

172
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,154
我曾经有一次看到她带着银餐具走掉
I caught her making off with the silverware once.

173
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,782
- 谁?  - 罗贝莉娅・塞克维尔巴金斯
- Who?  - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

174
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,745
她把我所有的勺子都装进了她口袋里 哈!
She had all my spoons stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

175
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,121
讨厌的女人
Dreadful woman.

176
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,833
得留神盯着她 等我...
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I'm...

177
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,253
等我... 等我...
When I'm... When I'm...

178
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,756
等你什么?
When you're what?

179
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,763
没事了 没事
It's nothing. Nothing.

180
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,479
有些人开始对你很好奇了 叔叔
You know, some people are beginning to wonder about you, Uncle.

181
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,356
- 啊?  - 他们认为你变怪了
- Huh?  - They think you're becoming odd.

182
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,026
怪了? 哦 嗯
Odd? Oh. Hm.

183
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,527
孤僻
Unsociable.

184
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,614
我 孤僻? 开玩笑
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

185
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,073
乖乖的...
Be a good lad and put that...

186
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,283
把这个钉到门上去
on the gate.

187
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:13,999
非宴会事宜 请勿入内

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,127
你觉得他会来吗?
Do you think he'll come?

189
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,462
谁?
Who?

190
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,963
甘道夫
Gandalf.

191
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,176
哦... 哈 他可不会放过能表演他的小把戏的机会 他会给我们...
Oh... ho. He wouldn't miss a chance to let off his Whizpoppers. He'll give us...

192
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,844
演一场好戏的 等着吧
quite a show, you'll see.

193
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,180
- 好吧 那么 我就走了  - 去哪?
- Right, then. I'm off.  - Off to where?

194
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,516
东区森林 我要去给他个惊喜
East-farthing Woods. I'm going to surprise him.

195
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:34,020
哦 那你去吧 你肯定不想迟到
Well, go on, then. You don't want to be late.

196
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,070
他没迟到 哦 不 我也...
He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no. Not that I...

197
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,696
没迟到过
ever was.

198
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,866
那个时候 我总是很准时
In those days, I was always on time.

199
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,203
非常受人尊敬
I was entirely respectable.

200
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,082
我身上从没发生过...
And nothing unexpected...

201
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,086
意料之外的事情
ever happened.

202
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,999
意外之旅

203
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:19,999
60年前...

204
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,153
- 早上好  - 你什么意思?
- Good morning.  - What do you mean?

205
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,241
你是希望我早上好还是不管我想不想要...
Do you wish me a good morning or do you mean that it is a good morning...

206
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,701
我的早上都会好?
whether I want it or not?

207
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,914
或者你可能是想说这个早上你感觉非常好?
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning?

208
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,586
再或者你只是单纯的想表示这个早上会好? 嗯?
Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

209
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,964
我觉得 以上全对
All of them at once, I suppose.

210
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,717
嗯
Hmm.

211
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,805
我能帮你吗?
Can I help you?

212
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,725
有待观察
That remains to be seen.

213
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:59,188
我在寻找人一起探险
I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

214
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,902
探险?
An adventure?

215
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,992
不 我觉得布理以西没有人会对探险感兴趣
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree would have much interest in adventures.

216
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,580
邋遢 烦人 不爽的事情
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

217
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,791
让人吃不上晚餐 嘿嘿
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

218
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,792
嗯
Mm.

219
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,586
哈
Huh.

220
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,755
嗯
Hmm.

221
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,841
哦 哈
Oh. Ah.

222
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,176
早上好
Good morning.

223
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,262
真没想到有一日 我会被贝拉多娜・图克的儿子...
To think that I should have lived to be "good morninged"...

224
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,434
用一句 "早上好" 打发走 就好像我是上门推销扣子的人
by Belladonna Took's son as if I were selling buttons at the door.

225
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,102
你说什么?
Beg your pardon?

226
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,521
你变了 可是并不是完全往好的方向...
You've changed, and not entirely for the better...

227
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,898
比尔博・巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins.

228
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,316
抱歉 我认识你吗?
I'm sorry, do I know you?

229
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,653
呃 你知道我的名字 可是你对不上号了
Well, you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.

230
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,321
我是甘道夫
I'm Gandalf.

231
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,615
甘道夫就是...
And Gandalf means...

232
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,243
我
me.

233
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,496
甘道夫? 不是那个能...
Gandalf? Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

234
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,997
能变非常棒的烟火的游者巫师...
who made such excellent...

235
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,710
- 甘道夫吧? 老图克经常在仲夏夜放那个  - 嘿嘿 嗯
- fireworks? Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve.  - Heh, heh. Ahem.

236
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,963
不知道你还在干这个呢
No idea you were still in business.

237
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,548
那我应该干什么去了?
And where else should I be?

238
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,551
干什么...? 嗯
Where else...? Ahem.

239
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,140
呃 很高兴你还记得有关我的事情...
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember something about me...

240
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,060
虽然只记得我的烟火
even if it's only my fireworks.

241
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,480
对 是的 那就决定了
Yes. Well, that's decided.

242
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,482
这会对你很好...
It'll be very good for you...

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,694
让我觉得很有趣
and most amusing for me.

244
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,529
我应该通知其他人了
I shall inform the others.

245
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,991
通知谁? 什么? 不 不 不... 等等
Inform the who? What? No. No. No... Wait.

246
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,367
我们这的人不要...
We do not want...

247
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,746
探险 谢谢 今天不要 以后...
any adventures here, thank you. Not today. Not...

248
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,667
我建议你去山的那边或者海的对岸
I suggest you try Over the Hill or Across the Water.

249
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,463
早上好
Good morning.

250
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,222
早上好!
Morning!

251
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,613
十二个钱 给您 祝您愉快
Twelve. There we go. Have a very good day.

252
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,177
谢谢
Chum.

253
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,765
你好 比尔博先生 来看看
Hello, Mr. Bilbo. Here.

254

摸摸我这些球薯 又好又脆 看看
Have a feel of me tubers. Nice and firm, they are.

255
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,355
- 刚从西区运来的  - 很好 瓦利沃特先生
- Just come in from West Farthing.  - Very impressive, Mr. Worrywort.

256
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,317
这个 我估计你没看到一个巫师藏在这附近吧?
Now, I don't suppose you've seen a Wizard lurking around these parts?

257
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,318
是个高个子
A tall fellow.

258
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,903
长长的 灰色胡子
Long, gray beard.

带着尖尖的帽子
Pointy hat.

260
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,241
没见过那样的
Can't say I have.

261
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,709

264
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,092

265
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,093

266
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,345
不认识
No.

他说这里有吃的 而且有很多
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

273
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,818
他... 他说? 谁说?
He... He said? Who said?

274
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,488
嗯

Hmm. It's just that, um, I wasn't expecting company.

281
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,607
来客人了
That'll be the door.

282
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,445

Evening, brother.

292
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,800
我发誓...
By my beard...

293
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,970
你比上次见面时更矮更胖了
you're shorter and wider than last we met.

294
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,846
胖了 没有矮
Wider, not shorter.

295
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,766
看上去依然神采奕奕
Sharp enough for both of us.

296
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,736
抱歉? 对不起 我不想打扰
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

297
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,032
但是 你们应该走错人家了吧
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure you're in the right house.

298
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,243
- 你吃饭了么?  - 我不是不喜欢客人...
- Have you eaten?  - It's not that I don't like visitors...

299
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,078
我跟隔壁的...
I like visitors...

300
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,372
霍比特人一样好客
as much as the next Hobbit.

301
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,126
不过我还是喜欢已经认识的客人
But I do like to know them before they come visiting.

302
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,627
- 这是啥?  - 没见过
- What is this?  - I don't know.

303
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,755
- 我觉得是奶酪 变蓝了  - 那是发霉了
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.  - It's riddled with mold.

304
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:45,344
是这样 我不认识你们俩 一点都不认识 我不想...
The thing is, I don't know either of you. Not in the slightest. I don't mean...

305
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,596
没礼貌 不过还是得说出来
to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind.

306
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,848
- 对不起  - 你认为...?
- I'm sorry.  - You think...?

307
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,978
原谅你了
Apology accepted.

308
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,646
- 啊  - 快 倒满 兄弟...
- Ah.  - Now, fill it up, brother...

309
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,564
别小气
don't stint.

310
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,151
- 你想撑死啊?  - 你想看吗 我还能再吃一遍
- You wanna get stuck in?  - I could eat again if you insist, brother.

311
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,989
- 菲力  - 还有奇力
- Fili.  - And Kili.

312
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,991
为您效劳
At your service.

313
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,576
你一定是巴金斯先生
You must be Mr. Boggins.

314
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,911
不是! 你们不能进来 你们走错了
Nope! You can't come in. You've come to the wrong house.

315
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,038
什么?
What?

316
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,498
- 取消了吗?  - 没人通知我们
- Has it been canceled?  - No one told us.

317
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,417
不 没有取消
No, nothing's been canceled.

318
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,501
那就好
That's a relief.

319
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,840
小心放置
Careful with these.

320
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,509
我刚磨过的
I just had them sharpened.

321
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,428
- 这地方不错  - 是啊
- It's nice, this place.  - Yeah.

322
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,890
- 你自己建的?  - 什么? 不 家族流传了很多年了
- Did you do it yourself?  - What? No, it's been in the family for years.

323
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,934
那是我妈妈的嫁妆箱 不要这样好吗?
That's my mother's glory box. Can you please not do that?

324
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,729
菲力 奇力 过来搭把手
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

325
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,315
德瓦林先生 哈哈
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

326
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,069
把这个推到走廊去 不然就不能全进来了
Shove this in the hallway. Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

327
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,113
"全进来"? 还有多少? 你要搬哪去?
"Everyone"? How many more are there? Where do you want this?

328
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,199
- 不行  - 太重了
- Oh, no.  - It's really heavy.

329
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,993
不许进来 家里没人!
No. No. There's nobody home!

330
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,913
找别人称兄道弟去吧
Go away and bother somebody else.

331
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,291
餐厅里的矮人多得装不下了
There's far too many Dwarves in my dining room as it is.

332
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,420
如果这是哪个榆木脑袋搞的恶作剧...
If this is some clot-head's idea of a joke...

333
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,090
我只能说...
I can only say it is in very...

334
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,132
太没品了
poor taste.

335
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,135
下去...
Get off...

336
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,512
你个大块头!
you big lump!

337
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,435
甘道夫
Gandalf.

338
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,775
抱歉 那是我的鸡肉 呃...
Excuse me, that's my chicken. Um...

339
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,778
别... 别碰... 那是我的酒 拜托!
If... If you don't... That's my wine. Excuse me!

340
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,159
他受伤了
He's got an injury.

341
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,036
你指他头上的斧子?
You mean the ax in his head?

342
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,123
死了? 不 只是砍在脑门上
Dead? No, only between his ears.

343
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,500
还能走路呢
His legs work fine.

344
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,003
把这些东西放回去
Put those back.

345
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,088
放回去
Put that back.

346
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,339
放回去
Put that back.

347
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,298
别拿果酱
Not the jam.

348
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,466
拜托 拜托
Excuse me. Excuse me.

349
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,553
稍微有点多了 对吧? 你有奶酪刀吗?
It's a tad excessive, isn't it? Have you got a cheese knife?

350
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,597
- "奶酪刀"? 他整块的吃  - 呃
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.  - Ugh.

351
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,184
不 那是蒙哥祖父的椅子... 不行 那个也是 拜托放回去
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair... No, so is that. Take it back, please.

352
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,272
- 我听不到你说什么  - 这是古董 不是用来坐的
- I cannot hear what you're saying.  - It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

353
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:06,819
那是书 不是杯托 地图也放下
That is a book, not a coaster. And put that map down.

354
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,321
- 抱歉 甘道夫先生?  - 怎么?
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?  - Yes?

355
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,158
要来一杯甘菊茶吗?
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

356
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,121
不 谢谢了 朵力 还是来杯红酒好了
Oh, no, thank you, Dori. A little red wine for me, I think.

357
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,793
哦! 小心
Whoop! Mind out.

358
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,381
呃 菲力 奇力 呃...
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

359
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,675
欧因 葛罗因
Oin, Gloin.

360
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,845
德瓦林 巴林 毕佛 波佛 庞博...
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

361
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,723
- 朵力 诺力 欧力!  - 不 不许吃我的得奖作品 谢谢
- Dori, Nori. Ori!  - No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

362
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,475
放手 谢谢
No, thank you.

363
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,105
嗯 说的很对 毕佛
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

364
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,566
好像还少了一个矮人
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

365
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:51,197
他只是迟到了 他去北方跟同族开会了 他会来的
He is late, is all. He traveled north to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

366
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,117
甘道夫先生? 您要的红酒来了
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine, as requested.

367
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,328
有一股水果的芳香
It's got a fruity bouquet.

368
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,830
哦 干杯
Oh. Cheers.

369
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,876
庞博在吃第二条羊腿了
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

370
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,465
不可能 那么远肯定接不住
No chance. Not from that distance.

371
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,592
打赌?庞博...
Wanna bet? Bombur...

372
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,510
接着!
catch!

373
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,014
我来帮你
I'll help you with that.

374
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,564
哦 你这...
Oh, you great...

375
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,857
大饭桶
galumphing git!

376
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,150
谁还要麦芽酒? 给你
Who wants an ale? There you go.

377
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,068
伙计 这里
Over here, brother.

378
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
你得再喝一杯...
I said have another drink...

379
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,531
给你
Here you go.

380
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,995
数三声干杯!
Ale on the count of three!

381
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:40,913
一...
One...

382
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,790
- 二...  - 干杯!
- two...  - Up!

383
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,469
就知道你会这样!
I knew you had it in you!

384
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,264
抱歉 这是杯垫 不是抹布
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth.

385
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,557
都破成这样了
But it's full of holes.

386
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,976
它就应该长这样 针织的
It's supposed to look like that. It's crochet.

387
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,145
如果你喜欢的话 编织也是很好玩的
And a wonderful game it is too, if you've got the balls for it.

388
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,231
这些矮人真讨厌!
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

389
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,150
亲爱的比尔博 你这是怎么了?
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

390
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,153
怎么了? 我家里一堆矮人
What's the matter? I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

391
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,905
他们来这干什么?
What are they doing here?

392
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,826
习惯了就会觉得他们是很欢乐的一群人了
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering once you get used to them.

393
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,953
我不想习惯他们
I don't want to get used to them.

394
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,290
瞧瞧我的厨房 地毯上踩的全是泥巴
Look at the state of my kitchen. There's mud trod into the carpet.

395
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,874
储藏室也被一扫而光
They've pillaged the pantry.

396
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,460
更别说他们在厕所干的事情了
I won't tell you what they've done in the bathroom.

397
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,506
下水道都坏了 真不知道他们来我家干什么!
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't understand what they're doing in my house!

398
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,886
抱歉 打扰一下 这盘子该怎么处理?
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but what should I do with my plate?

399
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,347
这儿 欧力 给我吧
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

400
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:45,769
放回来
Take that back.

401
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,687
拜托
Excuse me.

402
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,188
这是我母亲的...
That's my mother's...

403
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,940
西域陶瓷 已经有...
West Farthing pottery. It's over...

404
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,358
100多年历史了!
100 years old!

405
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,487
你们能...
And can you...

406
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,488
不这样么?
not do that?

407
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,406
刀子会变钝的
You'll blunt them.

408
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,533
听他说啥了吗 小子们?
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

409
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:00,993
他说...
He says...

410
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,911
我们会把刀弄钝
we'll blunt the knives.

411
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,997
# 刀子敲钝 叉子掰弯 #

# That's what Bilbo Baggin hates#

415
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,757
# 衣服撕碎 满地油腻 #
# Cut the cloth, tread on the fat #

416
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,800
# 吃剩骨头 垫子上放 #
# Leave the bones on the bedroom mat #

417
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,510
# 牛奶打开 倒在地上 #
# Pour the milk on the pantry floor #

418
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,805
# 酒渍溅到 #

419
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:22,723
# 每扇门上 #
# on every door #

420
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,516
# 陶瓷摔碎 扔碗里煮 #

421

422
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,227

423
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,520
# 若还完整 #
# If they are whole #

424
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,192
# 全扔客厅 散落一地 #
# Send them down the hall to roll #

425
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,577
# 气得比尔博・巴金斯火冒三丈 #
# That's what Bilbo Baggins hates #

426
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,624
比尔博
Bilbo.

427
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,301
他来了
He is here.

428
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,890
你好 甘道夫
Gandalf.

429
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,101
我记得你说...
I thought you said...

430
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,394
这里很好找...
this place would be easy to find...

431
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,146
但我迷路了 两次
I lost my way, twice.

432
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,817
要不是门上有标记 我绝对找不到这儿
I wouldn't have found it at all had it not been for that mark on the door.

433
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,945
标记? 门上没有标记 一周前刚漆过
Mark? There's no mark on that door. It was painted a week ago.

434
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,198
有的 我标记上去的
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

435
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:26,120
比尔博・巴金斯 允许我向你介绍这些伙伴的领袖:
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce the leader of our company:

436
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,622
索林・橡木盾
Thorin Oakenshield.

437
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,374
那么...
So...

438
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,627
你就是那个霍比特人
this is the Hobbit.

439
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,964
和我说说 巴金斯先生 以前打过仗吗?
Tell me, Mr. Baggins, have you done much fighting?

440
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,716
- 你说什么?  - 用斧子还是剑?
- Pardon me? Ax or sword?

441
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,801
喜欢用什么武器?
What's your weapon of choice?

442
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,471
呃 非要问的话 我对扔板栗颇有心得...
Well, I do have some skill at conkers, if you must know...

443
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,267
但这有什么联系吗?
but I fail to see why that's relevant.

444
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,227
如我所料
Thought as much.

445
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,230
比起飞贼 他更像个杂货商
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

446
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,153
伊瑞德隆会议...
What news...

447
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,156
传来什么消息? 他们都来了吗?
from the meeting in Ered Luin? Did they all come?

448
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,409
- 七个王国的使者都来了  - 全都来了!
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.  - All of them!

449
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,203
铁丘陵的矮人怎么说?
And what did the Dwarves of the Iron Hills say?

450
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,290
戴因来吗?
Is Dain with us?

451
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,085
他们不愿意来
They will not come.

452
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,214
他们说这次探险...
They say this quest...

453
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,634
仅仅是我们自己的事
is ours and ours alone.

454
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,347
你们要去探险?
You're going on a quest?

455
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:32,853
比尔博 亲爱的伙计 再多点几盏灯吧
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have a little more light.

456
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,606
在遥远的东方...
Far to the east...

457
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,984
穿越无数的山脉河流...
over ranges and rivers...

458
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,529
跨过无尽的森林和荒漠...
beyond woodlands and wastelands...

459
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,073
有一座孤峰傲立着
lies a single, solitary peak.

460
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,412
"孤山"
"The Lonely Mountain."

461
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,123
没错 欧因读到过...
Aye, Oin has read...

462
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:57,711
预言的征兆 征兆显示时机已到
the portents, and the portents say it is time.

463
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,046
如预言所述...
Ravens have been seen...

464
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,841
渡鸦飞回山中
flying back to the mountain, as it was foretold.

465
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,636
"昔日的鸟儿回归...
"When the birds of yore return...

466
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,970
伊鲁柏之时...
to Erebor...

467
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,722
魔兽的统治...
the reign of the beast...

468
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,641
将会结束"
will end. "

469
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,729
- 什么魔兽?  - 指的是...
- Uh, what beast?  - That would be a reference...

470
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,397
恐惧之王史矛革...
to Smaug the Terrible...

471
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,899
我们时代...
chiefest and greatest...

472
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,275
最可怕的灾难
calamity of our age.

473
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,987
会飞的喷火者
Airborne fire-breather.

474
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,239
剃刀般尖锐的牙齿...
Teeth like razors...

475
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,949
肉钩一样的爪子
claws like meat hooks.

476
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,492
极度喜爱贵重金属
Fond of precious metals.

477
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,618
我知道龙长啥样
I know what a dragon is.

478
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,912
我才不怕 我准备好了
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

479
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,915
我要让他的菊花好好尝尝矮人钢铁的厉害!
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron right up his jacksie!

480
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,833
好小子 欧力!
Good lad, Ori!

481
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:36,750
坐下
Sit down.

482
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,168
即使整支军队出动...
The task would be difficult...

483
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,795
任务也很艰巨...
with an army behind us...

484
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,130
何况我们只有13个人
but we number just 13.

485
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,258
而且其中还有歪瓜裂枣...
And not 13 of the best...

486
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,176
傻头傻脑的
nor brightest.

487
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,303
喂 你说谁傻瓜呢?
Hey, who are you calling dim?

488
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,305
不好意思 他刚说什么?
Sorry, what did he say?

489
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,432
我们虽然人少...
We may be few in number...

490
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,228
但我们是战士 所有人...
but we're fighters, all of us...

491
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,479
都会奋战到底
to the last Dwarf.

492
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,898
你们还忘了 我们有巫师结伴
And you forget, we have a Wizard in our company.

493
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,942
甘道夫可以杀掉上百条龙
Gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons.

494
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,653
这个 我不敢说...
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

495
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,822
- 那有多少?  - 什么?
- How many, then?  - What?

496
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,323
你杀过多少条龙?
How many dragons have you killed?

497
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,286
说啊
Go on.

498
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,787
给个数
Give us a number.

499
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,457
拜托 别吵了
Excuse me. Please.

500
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,797
如果我们能看见这些预兆...
If we have read these signs...

501
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,675
难道别的种族就看不出来吗?
do you not think others will have read them too?

502
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,555
谣言已经传开
Rumors have begun to spread.

503
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,641
那巨龙史矛革已经有60年无人见过
The dragon, Smaug, has not been seen for 60 years.

504
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,562
许多人都觊觎着东方那片土地 思索...
Eyes look east to the mountain, assessing...

505
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,733
徘徊 权衡利弊
wondering, weighing the risk.

506
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,527
或许我们的宝藏现在无人看守
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected.

507
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,615
我们是坐视别人抢走我们的东西?
Do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours?

508
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,034
还是抓住机会...
Or do we seize this chance...

509
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,201
夺回伊鲁柏?
to take back Erebor?

510
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,290
可是 要塞的正门被堵死了
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

511
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,583
已经没有路...
There is no way...

512
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,710
可以进山了
into the mountain.

513
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,213
这可未必 亲爱的巴林
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

514
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,677
你怎么会有这个?
How came you by this?

515
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
是你父亲...
It was given to me...

516
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,056
给我的
by your father.

517
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,807
索恩给我的
By Thrain.

518
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,559
要我保管
For safekeeping.

519
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,102
现在...
It is yours...

520
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,437
是你的了
now.

521
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,279
如果有钥匙...
If there is a key...

522
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,865
肯定就有门
there must be a door.

523
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,158
这些符语...
These runes...

524
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,954
暗示有个密门通向要塞大厅
speak of a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.

525
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,289
有别的方法进去
There's another way in.

526
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,293
能找到最好 但矮人的门关着的时候看不见
Well, if we can find it, but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

527
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,465
位置就在这张地图上...
The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map...

528
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,676
但是我不知道如何找到它
and I do not have the skill to find it.

529
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,096
但是中土世界有人可以
But there are others in Middle-earth who can.

530
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,351
我想的计划需要做的非常隐蔽...
The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth...

531
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,645
并且需要巨大的勇气
and no small amount of courage.

532
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:07,567
如果我们够细心够机灵 我相信是可以做到的
But if we are careful and clever, I believe that it can be done.

533
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,319
所以我们需要一个飞贼
That's why we need a burglar.

534
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,115
要一个本领高强的飞贼 最好是专家
Hmm. And a good one too. An expert, I'd imagine.

535
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,617
你是吗?
And are you?

536
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,454
我是什么?
Am I what?

537
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,416
他说他就是一个专家
He said he's an expert.

538
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,754
我? 不不 我不是飞贼 我这辈子从未偷过东西
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar. I've never stolen a thing in my life.

539
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,632
我也同意巴金斯先生
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr. Baggins.

540
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,843
他绝对不是当飞贼的料
He's hardly burglar material.

541
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,052
不是
Nope.

542
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,515
是啊 既不会战斗也不会防御的软弱之人无法在野外生存
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

543
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,600
他也就一般
He's just fine.

544
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,357
够了!
Enough!

545
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,151
我说比尔博・巴金斯是...
If I say Bilbo Baggins...

546
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,861
飞贼 那他...
is a burglar, then a burglar...

547
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,529
就是
he is.

548
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,323
霍比特人的脚步轻盈...
Hobbits are light on their feet...

549
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,703
如果他们想 大多数人都注意不到他们
In fact, they can pass unseen by most, if they choose.

550
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,498
虽然龙对于矮人气味十分熟悉...
And, while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of Dwarf...

551
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,205
但是霍比特人的气息 它就完全不了解...
the scent of a Hobbit is all but unknown to him...

552
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:10,538
这会给我们带来很大优势
which gives us a distinct advantage.

553
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,626
你让我寻找第14名成员
You asked me to find the 14th member of this

554
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,126
我推荐巴金斯先生
company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

555
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:18,383
他还是很能干的 别被外表迷惑了
There's a lot more to him than appearances suggest.

556
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:21,385
他所能做的 完全超乎你们得想象
And he's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know.

557
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:24,306
他自己也不知道
Including himself.

558
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,556
在这点上 你得相信我
You must trust me on this.

559
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,897
好吧
Very well.

560
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:38,816
- 就按你的来做  - 不 不
- We will do it your way.  - No, no.

561
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,443
- 把合同给他  - 算我们一个
- Give him the contract.  - We're in. We're off.

562
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,653
这是惯例条款
It's just the usual.

563
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,818
包括总体支出...
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...

564
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:46,578
所需时间 报酬...
time required, remuneration...

565
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,618
葬礼安排 等等
funeral arrangements, so forth.

566
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:50,991
葬礼安排?
Funeral arrangements?

567
00:34:56,788 --> 00:34:58,290
我可不能保证他小命安全
I cannot guarantee his safety.

568
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,251
了解
Understood.

569
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:03,258
未来我也不会照顾他
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

570
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,470
同意
Agreed.

571
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:08,939
"条款: 事成付款
"Terms: Cash on

572
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,184
报酬将达到并不超过总收益的十四分之一 如果有收益"
delivery, up to but not exceeding one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

573
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,265
很公平
Hmm. Seems fair.

574
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:19,153
"本队将不对成员未来所受的各种伤负责...
"Present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by...

575
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:24,568
这些伤害包括但不局限于撕裂伤...
or sustained as a consequence thereof, including, but not limited to lacerations...

576
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,657
内脏伤..."
evisceration..."

577
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:31,323
火葬?
Incineration?

578
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:34,459
对 那龙也许眨眼间就把你的血肉全部烧了
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye.

579
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:42,630
- 你没事吧?  - 嗯? 我很好
- You all right, laddie?  - Huh? Yeah.

580
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:45,720
头有点晕
Feel a bit faint.

581
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:48,055
- 想象一下会飞的火炉  - 新鲜空气
- Think furnace with wings.  - Air.

582
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,716
我需要缓口气
I need air.

583
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:52,477
炽烈的亮光 灼烧的疼痛 然后噗的一下
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.

584
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:54,637
你就成了一堆炭灰了
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

585
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,020
不好
Nope.

586
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,106
你真会帮倒忙 波佛
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

587
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,034
我没事的 让我安静的待会就行了
I'll be all right. Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

588
00:36:08,193 --> 00:36:11,538
你太沉溺于这种安逸的生活了
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

589
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:15,993
你怎么对那些杯垫和你老妈的碟子...
Tell me, when did doilies and your mother's dishes...

590
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,828
看得如此重要?
become so important to you?

591
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,471
我记忆中的那个小霍比特人总是
I remember a young Hobbit who was always

592
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:23,171
在林子间寻找精灵们
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

593
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,549
总是玩到很晚回家...
Who would stay out late, come home after dark...

594
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:30,341
全身都是泥巴 树枝 还有萤火虫
trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

595
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:32,885
那个年轻的霍比特人 总是想要...
A young Hobbit who would have liked nothing better...

596
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:36,518
探索夏尔外面的世界
than to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire.

597
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,935
世界可不是一本书或是一张地图
The world is not in your books and maps.

598
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:44,150
它在屋外
It's out there.

599
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:48,108
我不能就这样无声无息地和你们走
I can't just go running off into the blue.

600
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,448
我是住在袋底洞的巴金斯
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

601
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:53,742
但你也是图克家族的
You are also a Took.

602
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:59,077
你知道吗 你的曾曾曾曾伯父 吼牛・图克...
Did you know that your great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...

603
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:01,872
体型大得能够骑一匹马吗?
was so large, he could ride a real horse?

604
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,208
- 知道  - 当然 他可以
- Yes.  - Yes, well, he could.

605
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:07,253
绿原之战中 他冲向哥布林大军
In the Battle of Green Fields, he charged the Goblin ranks.

606
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:11,265
他的力量之大 用棒子生生把敌方国王脑袋敲下来...
He swung his club so hard, it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

607
00:37:11,423 --> 00:37:15,599
滚了一百多码才掉到一个兔子窝里
and it sailed 100 yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole.

608
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:17,517
他们赢得了战役
And thus, the battle was won.

609
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:21,308
从那以后 有人因此发明了高尔夫(哥布林国王名叫高尔夫裘)
And the game of golf invented at the same time.

610
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:26,655
我知道你是乱编的
I do believe you made that up.

611
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:30,568
所有精彩的故事都需要润润色嘛
Well, all good stories deserve embellishment.

612
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,081
如果你回来了 那你也有自己的传奇故事了
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.

613
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:42,045
你能保证我能安全回来?
Can you promise that I will come back?

614
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:45,499
不能
No.

615
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:47,755
如果你能回得来...
And if you do...

616
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:50,883
你绝对不会和现在一样
you will not be the same.

617
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:54,216
我也同意
That's what I thought.

618
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:58,432
不好意思 甘道夫 我不能签这个
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

619
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:02,224
你找错霍比特人了
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

620
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:12,276
我们的飞贼似乎不干了
It appears we have lost our burglar.

621
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:15,320
也许这样也好
Probably for the best.

622
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,865
事事总不能如意啊
The odds were always against us.

623
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:21,035
说到底 我们是什么?
After all, what are we?

624
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:24,378
商人 矿工...
Merchants, miners...

625
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:27,169
铁匠 做玩具的
tinkers, toy-makers.

626
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:30,302
看起来不太像是一群英雄们
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

627
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:33,637
我们中间还是有战士的
There are a few warriors amongst us.

628
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:36,174
残兵败将
Old warriors.

629
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:38,719
比起铁丘陵的矮人军队
I would take each and every one of these Dwarves...

630
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,016
我宁可有这些人的追随
over an army from the Iron Hills.

631
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:44,145
因为在我号召时他们一定能回应
For when I called upon them, they answered.

632
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:47,485
忠诚 荣耀...
Loyalty, honor...

633
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,692
热诚
a willing heart.

634
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,908
我觉得这些就够了
I can ask no more than that.

635
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,657
你不必亲自去
You don't have to do this.

636
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,697
你可以选择不去
You have a choice.

637
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:01,867
我们族人拥戴你 愿意受你领导
You've done honorably by our people.

638
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,500
是你在蓝山开辟新的居住地
You have built a new life for us in the Blue Mountains.

639
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,833
过着和平富裕的生活
A life of peace and plenty.

640
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:15,639
我觉得这一切比伊鲁柏的金子更宝贵
A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor.

641
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:21,099
从我的爷爷传到我父亲 现在到我了
From my grandfather to my father, this has come to me.

642
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,600
他们无时无刻都在想着矮人能重夺自己的故乡
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

643
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,903
没有其他选择 巴林
There is no choice, Balin.

644
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:33,902
我别无选择
Not for me.

645
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:37,949
那么 我们将与你同生共死
Then we are with you, laddie.

646
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:42,248
我们会成功的
We will see it done.

647
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:11,859
# 登上远山冰寒之巅 #
# Far over the misty mountains cold #

648
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,401
# 深入地牢深渊之底 #
# To dungeons deep #

649
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:21,780
# 探索古老洞窟之中 #
# And caverns old #

650
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:26,577
# 在太阳升起之前 #
# We must away #

651
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,256
# 我们必须整装出发 #
# 'Ere break of day #

652
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:39,497
# 去追寻那遗落之财 #
# To find our long-forgotten gold #

653
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:48,840
# 高处的松树在低吼 #
# The pines were roaring on the height #

654
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:57,891
# 夜晚的寒风在呼啸 #
# The winds were moaning in the night #

655
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:06,858
# 希望之火 传播不息 #
# The fire was red, it flaming spread #

656
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:15,676
# 光明从这火中而来 #
# The trees like torches blazed with light #

657
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,758
早啊?
Hello?

658
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,057
好样的
Yes.

659
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:12,064
不错
Yes.

660
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:25,967
比尔博先生 你这是去哪儿?
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

661
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,883
- 不能停下说 我已经迟到了!  - 什么迟到?
- Can't stop, I'm already late!  - Late for what?

662
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:32,145
我要去冒险!
I'm going on an adventure!

663
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:41,108
我说过的 我说过吗? 这一趟来得不值啊
I said it. Didn't I say it? Coming here was a waste of time.

664
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,817
你说的没错
That's true enough.

665
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,946
这主意太荒唐了 霍比特人? 半身人(通用语中对霍比特人的称呼)?
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit? A Halfling?

666
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:48,694
等等!
Wait!

667
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:50,659
等下我!
Wait!

668
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:03,467
我签名了
I signed it.

669
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:06,466
给
Here.

670
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:18,308
很好 一切都按程序填写
Everything appears to be in order.

671
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:20,852
欢迎 巴金斯大师...
Welcome, Master Baggins...

672
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,069
欢迎加入索林・橡木盾小队
to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

673
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:31,616
给他一匹马崽子
Give him a pony.

674
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:33,664
哦 不用这么麻烦了
No, no, that won't be necessary.

675
00:44:33,823 --> 00:44:36,042
谢了 我自信我能赶上你们步伐
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

676
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,749
我经常出去徒步旅游的 知道吗?
I've done my fair share of walking holidays, you know?

677
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:41,001
有一次还跑到蛙村去了
Even got as far as Frogmorton once.

678
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,763
快点 诺力 给钱
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

679
00:44:58,764 --> 00:45:00,858
- 还有一袋  - 谢了 小子
- One more.  - Thanks, lad.

680
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:02,610
这是干嘛?
What's that about?

681
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:07,324
哦 他们在打赌 赌你会不会回心转意
Oh, they took wagers on whether or not you'd turn up.

682
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:10,325
大多数人赌你不会
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

683
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:13,287
你觉得呢?
And what did you think?

684
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:22,672
我的好朋友 我从未怀疑过你
My dear fellow, I never doubted you for a second.

685
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:31,468
这马毛让我过敏了
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

686
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,717
不不 等下
No, wait, wait, stop.

687
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,437
停下! 我们得回头
Stop! We have to turn around.

688
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,764
到底怎么啦?
What on earth is the matter?

689
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:42,108
- 我忘记带我的手帕了  - 给你
- I forgot my handkerchief.  - Here.

690
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:44,769
用这个
Use this.

691
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:50,699
继续行进
Move on.

692
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,664
你得习惯不带手帕的生活...
You'll have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs...

693
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:03,212
还有很多其他的事情 比尔博・巴金斯...
and a good many other things, Bilbo Baggins...

694
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:06,754
直到这趟旅程结束
before we reach our journey's end.

695
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:12,764
你在夏尔的丘陵与小河边长大
You were born to the rolling hills and little rivers of the Shire.

696
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:16,677
但如今家园已在身后
But home is now behind you.

697
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,971
世界尽在眼前
The world is ahead.

698
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:04,057
嗨 姑娘 真是个好姑娘!
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

699
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,524
这是我俩的小秘密 桃金娘
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

700
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:11,655
谁也不许告诉 嘘 嘘
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

701
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:17,449
那是什么?
What was that?

702
00:47:18,821 --> 00:47:19,868
是半兽人
Orcs.

703
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:21,574
半兽人?
Orcs?

704
00:47:23,284 --> 00:47:26,208
是些嗜杀成性的家伙 外头起码有几十个
Throat-cutters. There'll be dozens of them out there.

705
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:28,502
在孤土到处可见它们的身影(孤土西起蓝山 东至迷雾山脉)
The lone-lands are crawling with them.

706
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:31,543
他们总在凌晨时分 人们熟睡时动手
They strike in the wee small hours when everyone's asleep.

707
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:34,883
干脆利落 人们来不及尖叫 就已血流成河
Quick and quiet, no screams. Just lots of blood.

708
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:41,098
你们以为这些很好玩?
You think that's funny?

709
00:47:43,054 --> 00:47:45,432
你们以为被半兽人夜袭是个玩笑?
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

710
00:47:46,223 --> 00:47:47,645
我们不是这个意思
We didn't mean anything by it.

711
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:50,607
是啊 你们不是这个意思
No, you didn't.

712
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:53,234
你们对这世界根本一无所知
You know nothing of the world.

713
00:47:54,857 --> 00:47:57,110
别介意 小家伙
Don't mind him, laddie.

714
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:01,998
索林比任何人都更有理由痛恨半兽人
Thorin has more cause than most to hate Orcs.

715
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:09,876
在恶龙占领孤山后...
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

716
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:15,884
国王索尔曾试图收复古老的矮人王国 摩瑞亚
King Thror tried to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

717
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:21,100
但敌人早已捷足先登
But our enemy had got there first.

718
00:48:33,395 --> 00:48:37,445
摩瑞亚被半兽人军团占领...
Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...

719
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:42,330
领头的是它们族群中最邪恶的家伙
led by the most vile of all their race:

720
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,909
毁灭者阿索格
Azog the Defiler.

721
00:48:48,202 --> 00:48:50,921
这个身形巨大的刚达巴半兽人
The giant Gundabad Orc...

722
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:56,344
曾发誓要杀尽杜林一族
had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

723
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:02,300
他一出手...
He began...

724
00:49:03,384 --> 00:49:05,261
就砍下了国王的脑袋
by beheading the king.

725
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:19,491
不!
No!

726
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:25,540
索林的父亲索恩悲伤得几乎发狂
Thrain, Thorin's father, was driven mad by grief.

727
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:28,326
他失踪了 也许被俘 也许被杀...
He went missing. Taken prisoner or killed...

728
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:31,087
我们无从知晓
We did not know.

729
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:33,422
我们失去了首领
We were leaderless.

730
00:49:34,165 --> 00:49:37,715
失败与死亡...
Defeat and death...

731
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:39,720
正步步紧逼
were upon us.

732
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:46,519
就在那时我看到了他
That is when I saw him.

733
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:50,480
一位年轻的矮人王子...
A young Dwarf prince...

734
00:49:51,473 --> 00:49:55,068
力战苍白半兽人
facing down the pale Orc.

735
00:49:59,315 --> 00:50:02,910
他孤身与强敌血战
He stood alone against this terrible foe.

736
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,254
他的盔甲碎了...
His armor rent...

737
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:17,925
只能挥舞着一截橡木当盾牌
wielding nothing but an oaken branch as a shield.

738
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:35,644
那一天 毁灭者阿索格明白了...
Azog the Defiler learned that day...

739
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:40,569
杜林族系绝不会轻易瓦解
that the line of Durin would not be so easily broken.

740
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:46,469
为荣誉

741
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:52,069
给我杀!

742
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,052
我们集结了军力
Our forces rallied...

743
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:13,772
击退了半兽人
and drove the Orcs back.

744
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:16,938
我们的敌人...
And our enemy...

745
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:19,736
被打败了
had been defeated.

746
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,574
但那一晚既没有庆宴...
But there was no feast...

747
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:27,028
也没有歌声...
nor song that night...

748
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:31,995
因为我们的伤亡太过惨重
for our dead were beyond the count of grief.

749
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:36,420
只有极少数得以存活
We few had survived.

750
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:46,509
于是我告诉自己...
And I thought to myself then...

751
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:53,604
还有这样一个人值得我去追随
there is one who I could follow.

752
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,858
还有这样一个人...
There is one...

753
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:00,610
我愿视为王
I could call king.

754
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,877
那苍白半兽人呢?
And the pale Orc?

755
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:24,760
他后来怎么样了?
What happened to him?

756
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:28,468
他溜回了起兵的那个洞里
He slunk back into the hole whence he came.

757
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:32,517
早就因伤势过重死了
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

758
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:58,517
向大王汇报...

759
00:52:59,522 --> 00:53:02,947
我们找到了该死的矮人

760
00:53:18,597 --> 00:53:22,227
喂 甘道夫先生 这水漫金山的你就不能想想办法吗?
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something about this deluge?

761
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,274
这是在下雨 矮人大人...
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

762
00:53:25,437 --> 00:53:29,158
想止住雨的唯一办法就是等雨自己停下来
and it will continue to rain until the rain is done.

763
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:33,783
如果你想改变这世界上的天气 那恐怕得找别的巫师了
If you wish to change the weather of the world, you should find yourself another Wizard.

764
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:36,744
- 有别的吗?  - 别的什么?
- Are there any?  - What?

765
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:39,535
- 别的巫师  - 像我们这样的人有五个
- Other Wizards.  - There are five of us.

766
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:44,207
其中最位高权重的是白袍萨鲁曼
The greatest of our order is Saruman the White.

767
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:46,884
接下来是两位蓝袍巫师...
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

768
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,588
不过我已经忘了他们的名字了
Do you know, I've quite forgotten their names.

769
00:53:51,755 --> 00:53:52,972
那第五个呢?
And who is the fifth?

770
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:57,144
是褐袍瑞达加斯特
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

771
00:53:57,302 --> 00:54:01,057
他是个厉害的巫师吗? 还是和你差不多的?
Is he a great Wizard? Or is he more like you?

772
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:07,818
我想他自有他厉害的地方
I think he's a very great Wizard, in his own way.

773
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:12,614
他心地温和 偏爱与动物为伴
He's a gentle soul who prefers the company of animals to others.

774
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:15,825
始终盯防着东部的...
He keeps a watchful eye over the vast forest lands...

775
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:18,578
广阔森林地带 这是件好事
to the east. And a good thing too.

776
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:23,792
因为邪恶势力总会试图在世上寻找立足之地
For always evil will look to find a foothold in this world.

777
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:33,468
不妙 大事不妙了
Not good. Not good at all.

778
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:42,189
唷
Eww.

779
00:54:57,613 --> 00:54:59,957
哦 不 塞巴斯蒂安
Oh, no. Sebastian.

780
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,707
我的天哪
Good gracious.

781
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,646
快点
Come on.

782
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:29,903
退后! 给它点新鲜空气 拜托了
Move back! Give him some air, for goodness sake.

783
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:41,494
来 给
There. There.

784
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:45,498
我不明白为什么不起作用
I don't understand why it's not working.

785
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:48,130
这又不是巫术
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

786
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:53,422
巫术
Witchcraft.

787
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:58,599
哦 但它确实是巫术
Oh, but it is.

788
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:05,186
一种邪恶 强大的魔法
A dark and powerful magic.

789
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:49,586
让这动物免于诅咒
Lerya laman naiquentallo.

790
00:56:50,008 --> 00:56:53,186
现在聆听我的声音
Si a hlare omaquettar.

791
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,786
让其重新焕发生机
Na coilerya en-vinyanta.

792
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:02,386
现在聆听我的声音
Si a hlare omaquettar.

793
00:57:03,008 --> 00:57:10,686
让其重新焕发生机
Na coilerya en-vinyanta.

794
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,531
那些肮脏的生物究竟是从哪里来的?
Where on this good earth did those foul creatures come from?

795
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:45,452
古要塞?
The old fortress?

796
00:57:46,073 --> 00:57:47,245
带我去
Show me.

797
00:58:20,816 --> 00:58:22,568
我们今晚在这里扎营
We'll camp here for the night.

798
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:27,448
菲力 奇力 照看好马儿 和它们待在一块
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies. Make sure you stay with them.

799
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:31,748
这里以前住着一户农民
A farmer and his family used to live here.

800
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,709
- 欧因 葛罗因 生火  - 是
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.  - Aye.

801
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:35,918
好的
Right you are.

802
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:39,711
我觉得还是继续前进比较明智
I think it would be wiser to move on.

803
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:43,590
我们可以前往幽谷
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

804
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,757
我已经告诉你了...
I have told you already...

805
00:58:45,924 --> 00:58:47,801
我不会靠近那地方
I will not go near that place.

806
00:58:47,968 --> 00:58:50,266
为什么? 精灵可以提供帮助
Why not? The Elves could help us.

807
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,523
我们能补充食物 休养生息 听取建议
We could get food, rest, advice.

808
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:54,771
我不需要精灵的建议
I do not need their advice.

809
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:59,025
我们还有一张地图看不懂 爱隆能帮助我们
We have a map that we cannot read. Lord Elrond could help us.

810
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,564
帮助?
Help?

811
00:59:01,565 --> 00:59:03,693
恶龙袭击伊鲁柏的时候
A dragon attacks Erebor.

812
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:06,112
精灵提供帮助了吗?
What help came from the Elves?

813
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:09,118
半兽人扫荡摩瑞亚...
Orcs plunder Moria...

814
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,704
亵渎圣殿的时候
desecrate our sacred halls.

815
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:14,746
精灵们只是袖手旁观
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

816
00:59:15,746 --> 00:59:19,796
而你却要我去找那些背叛我祖父的人
And you ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather.

817
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,255
那些背叛我父亲的人
Who betrayed my father.

818
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:23,216
但你不是他们
You are neither of them.

819
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:27,591
我给你地图和钥匙 不是为了让你执着于往事
I did not give you that map and key for you to hold onto the past.

820
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:29,806
那本来就是属于我的
I did not know that they were yours to keep.

821
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:38,735
没事吧? 甘道夫你要去哪?
Everything all right? Gandalf, where are you going?

822
00:59:38,894 --> 00:59:42,319
去找这里唯一一个有理智的人
To seek the company of the only one around here who's got any sense.

823
00:59:42,481 --> 00:59:45,155
- 是谁?  - 我自己 巴金斯先生
- And who's that?  - Myself, Mr. Baggins.

824
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:48,112
我今天已经受够了矮人了
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

825
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:51,994
快点 庞博 我们都饿了
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

826
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:54,785
他会回来吗?
Is he coming back?

827
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,499
他已经离开很久了
He's been a long time.

828
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:02,004
- 谁?  - 甘道夫
- Who?  - Gandalf.

829
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,298
他是个巫师 知道自己在做什么
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

830
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:07,552
拿着 帮个忙 把这个给小伙子们送去
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

831
01:00:08,131 --> 01:00:09,678
住手 你已经吃得够多了
Stop it. You've had plenty.

832
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:13,471
饭做得不错啊 庞博 我还吃过更糟的
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur. I've had worse.

833
01:00:13,637 --> 01:00:15,685
- 本来可以让朵力做的  - 哈哈哈
- Dori could've cooked it.  - Ha-ha-ha.

834
01:00:15,806 --> 01:00:18,104
太好笑了
Hilarious.

835
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:30,116
怎么了?
What's the matter?

836
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,700
- 我们本应该看着马的  - 但我们遇到了些小问题
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.  - Only we've encountered a slight problem.

837
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:36,709
原本有16匹马
We had 16.

838
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,709
现在只有14匹了
Now there's 14.

839
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:45,343
黛西和伯格不见了
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

840
01:00:45,544 --> 01:00:47,342
哦 那可不妙 哈 哈
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

841
01:00:47,504 --> 01:00:50,132
那可糟透了 要去告诉索林吗?
And that is not good at all. Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

842
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:53,222
呃 不要 别让他担心
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

843
01:00:53,385 --> 01:00:56,639
身为队伍的正式飞贼 我们觉得你也许愿意去调查一下
As our official burglar, we thought you might like to look into it.

844
01:00:56,805 --> 01:00:58,182
这个 呃...
Well, uh...

845
01:00:58,723 --> 01:01:02,853
- 瞧 树像是被什么大家伙连根拔起的  - 我们也是这么想的
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.  - That was our thinking.

846
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:07,532
应该是某种巨大且危险的东西
It's something very big and possibly quite dangerous.

847
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,447
嘿
Hey.

848
01:01:10,026 --> 01:01:11,528
那里有光亮
There's a light.

849
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:13,617
过来
Over here.

850
01:01:16,157 --> 01:01:17,158
蹲下
Stay down.

851
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:24,044
那是什么?
What is it?

852
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:25,629
食人妖
Trolls.

853
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:44,936
哦
Oh.

854
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:54,537
他又抓走了桃金娘和薄荷
He's got Myrtle and Minty.

855
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:58,367
我想它们会被吃掉的 我们得采取行动
I think they're gonna eat them. We have to do something.

856
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:00,373
没错 你快上吧
Yes, you should.

857
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,631
食人妖脑袋又笨 动作又慢 你这么小 他们根本看不到你
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid, and you're so small, they'll never see you.

858
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:06,799
绝对安全 我们会跟在你身后的
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

859
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:10,588
如果遇到麻烦 就学谷仓猫头鹰叫两声 棕色猫头鹰叫一声
If you run into trouble, hoot twice like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.

860
01:02:10,754 --> 01:02:13,724
谷仓猫头鹰叫两声 不对 棕色猫头鹰叫两... 谷仓...
Twice like a barn owl. No, twice like a brown... Once like a...

861
01:02:13,924 --> 01:02:15,847
叫... 你们确定这是个好主意吗?
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?

862
01:02:16,217 --> 01:02:19,266
昨天吃羊肉 今天吃羊肉...
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

863
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:22,899
天哪 不会明天也吃羊肉吧
and, blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow.

864
01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:25,977
别发牢骚了
Quit your griping.

865
01:02:26,186 --> 01:02:30,441
这不是羊 这是新鲜的马肉
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

866
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:35,955
哦! 我不喜欢马 从来没喜欢过 它们身上连肥肉都没有
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have. Not enough fat on them.

867
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:38,456
总比干巴巴的老农夫好吧
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.

868
01:02:38,615 --> 01:02:42,995
他简直是皮包骨头 到现在我牙缝里还有呢
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still picking bits of him out of me teeth.

869
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:47,458
真棒 瞧你干的好事 鼻涕进锅里了
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

870
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:49,589
没准能添点味儿
Might improve the flavor.

871
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:52,300
啊 这儿还有呢
Ah. There's more where that came from.

872
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:53,801
- 哦 不 不准这样!  - 噢!
- Oh, no, you don't!  - Ow!

873
01:02:57,759 --> 01:02:59,636
坐下!
Sit down!

874
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:11,990
希望你能把这些马的内脏去掉
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

875
01:03:12,148 --> 01:03:14,867
我不喜欢吃内脏
I don't like the stinky parts.

876
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,995
- 噢!  - 我说了 坐下
- Ow!  - I said sit down.

877
01:03:18,154 --> 01:03:19,201
我饿死了!
I'm starving!

878
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:22,459
今晚到底吃不吃马肉了?
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

879
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:26,667
闭上你的臭嘴 我给什么你就吃什么
Shut your cakehole. You'll eat what I give you.

880
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:31,214
怎么让他当厨师的? 所有东西尝起来都是一个味儿
How come he's the cook? Everything tastes the same.

881
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:33,003
所有东西吃着都像鸡肉
Everything tastes like chicken.

882
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:34,341
除了鸡肉不像
Except the chicken.

883
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:35,889
鸡肉倒像是鱼!
What tastes like fish!

884
01:03:36,006 --> 01:03:39,351
我刚说过 你们应该心存感激
I'm just saying, a little appreciation would be nice.

885
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,475
哦 "谢谢你 伯特 做得真棒 伯特"
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert. Lovely stew, Bert."

886
01:03:45,682 --> 01:03:49,607
- 这有什么难的?  - 嘘 嘘
- How hard is that?  - Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

887
01:03:50,061 --> 01:03:52,860
只需要再撒些松鼠粪
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

888
01:03:53,982 --> 01:03:55,905
嘿 那是我的酒
Here, that's my grog.

889
01:03:58,528 --> 01:04:01,532
抱歉 噢!
Sorry. Ow!

890
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:07,663
哦 味道正好 不错
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

891
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:11,212
把你嘴巴凑过来接住 嗯?
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

892
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:13,209
不错吧?
Good, isn't it?

893
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,719
所以要我来当厨师
That's why I'm the cook.

894
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:29,693
哦 我肚子都叫了 我需要捞点东西吃
Oh, my guts are grumbling. I got to snaffle something.

895
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:32,604
- 肉 我要肉  - 啊! 啊!
- Flesh, I need flesh.  - Ah! Ah!

896
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:37,108
天哪!
Blimey!

897
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:40,780
伯特 伯特! 看我鼻子里喷出了什么
Bert. Bert! Look what's come out of me hooter.

898
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:43,073
它有手有脚 什么都有
It's got arms and legs and everything.

899
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:44,874
这是什么东西?
What is it?

900
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:47,707
我不知道 但我不喜欢它扭来扭去的样子
I don't know. But I don't like the way it wriggles around.

901
01:04:51,706 --> 01:04:54,926
你是什么东西? 特大号松鼠吗?
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

902
01:04:55,085 --> 01:04:56,803
我是个飞... 呃 霍比特人
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

903
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:59,055
一个飞蛾霍比特人?
A burglar Hobbit?

904
01:04:59,214 --> 01:05:00,841
我们能煮了他吗?
Can we cook him?

905
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,559
可以试试
We can try.

906
01:05:06,346 --> 01:05:08,440
他还不够我咬一大口的
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

907
01:05:08,598 --> 01:05:11,397
尽管不是皮包骨头
Not when he's skinned and boned.

908
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:14,571
也许附近还有更多的飞蛾霍比特人
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits around these parts.

909
01:05:14,729 --> 01:05:17,733
说不定够做个派
Might be enough for a pie.

910
01:05:18,024 --> 01:05:19,992
- 抓住他!  - 他动作太快了
- Grab him!  - He's too quick.

911
01:05:20,193 --> 01:05:23,493
好吧 快过来 你这小东...
Right. Come here, you little...

912
01:05:23,655 --> 01:05:24,872
抓住你了
Gotcha.

913
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:28,831
你还有其他小同伴躲在不该躲的地方吗?
Are there any more of you little fellas hiding where you shouldn't?

914
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:30,628
没有
No.

915
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:32,164
他在撒谎
He's lying.

916
01:05:32,372 --> 01:05:36,718
- 不 我没有!  - 把他悬到火上烤
- No, I'm not!  - Hold his toes over the fire.

917
01:05:36,918 --> 01:05:39,592
让他尖叫!
Make him squeal!

918
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:44,099
把他放下!
Drop him!

919
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:45,681
你说什么?
You what?

920
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:47,937
我说...
I said...

921
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:49,268
把他放下
drop him.

922
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:15,958
拿袋子来! 把他们用麻袋套上!
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!

923
01:06:38,188 --> 01:06:39,656
噢!
Ow!

924
01:07:05,256 --> 01:07:07,429
快点! 起来!
Come on! Get up!

925
01:07:07,717 --> 01:07:09,014
- 比尔博!  - 不要!
- Bilbo!  - Don't!

926
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:12,639
放下武器...
Lay down your arms...

927
01:07:13,306 --> 01:07:15,104
不然我们就撕了他
or we'll rip his off.

928
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:31,741
哦! 烫死了 烫死了 烫死了!
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

929
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:33,535
别费劲煮他们了
Don't bother cooking them.

930
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:37,956
我们直接坐上去 把他们压成肉酱吧
Let's just sit on them and squash them into jelly.

931
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:42,298
应该先这样爆炒再煎烤 最后撒些鼠尾草
They should be sauteed and grilled with a sprinkle of sage.

932
01:07:42,502 --> 01:07:44,004
这真的有必要吗?
Is this really necessary?

933
01:07:44,212 --> 01:07:45,964
听起来确实不错
That does sound quite nice.

934
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,599
- 松开我 先生  - 去吃和你个子一样大的东西吧
- Untie me, mister.  - Eat someone your own size.

935
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,223
别介意调料了
Never mind the seasoning.

936
01:07:51,386 --> 01:07:53,138
我们没有一整晚的时间
We ain't got all night.

937
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:56,691
黎明不远了 我们动作快点
Dawn ain't far away. Let's get a move on.

938
01:07:56,808 --> 01:07:59,277
我可不想被变成石头
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

939
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,323
等等!
Wait!

940
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:06,485
你们犯了个大错
You are making a terrible mistake.

941
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:08,904
你没法和他们讲道理 他们是白痴!
You can't reason with them. They're half-wits!

942
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:11,164
白痴? 那我们成什么了?
Half-wits? What does that make us?

943
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:14,580
我指的是调料的事
I meant with the seasoning.

944
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:17,503
调料怎么了?
What about the seasoning?

945
01:08:17,704 --> 01:08:18,956
你闻过他们的味道了么?
Well, have you smelt them?

946
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:22,839
想把他们烤熟装盘 你就得用比鼠尾草味道更重的调料
You're gonna need something stronger than sage before you plate this lot up.

947
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:26,096
- 叛徒!  - 你懂怎么煮矮人?
- Traitor!  - What do you know about cooking Dwarf?

948
01:08:26,671 --> 01:08:27,718
闭嘴
Shut up.

949
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,722
让 小格灰灰霍比特人来说
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

950
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:35,559
煮矮人的秘诀就在于...
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

951
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:38,817
- 嗯? 说吧 告诉我们秘诀  - 呃 就是...
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.  - It's, uh...

952
01:08:39,017 --> 01:08:41,065
我正准备说呢 秘诀就是...
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

953
01:08:43,604 --> 01:08:45,356
先剥皮
to skin them first.

954
01:08:45,523 --> 01:08:47,491
什么? 剥我们的皮?
What? Skin us?

955
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:50,157
汤姆 给我拿切片刀来
Tom, get me filleting knife.

956
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,993
我要剥了你的皮! 你这小...
I'll skin you, you little...!

957
01:08:52,155 --> 01:08:54,032
我不会忘记这件事的 我绝不会忘记
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

958
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,496
都是废话
What a load of rubbish.

959
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:59,625
我吃过好多带皮的
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

960
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,165
一口吞下 连靴子也吃下去
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.

961
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:05,088
他说的对
He's right.

962
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:07,883
吃些活矮人也没关系
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

963
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:12,804
美味又松脆
Nice and crunchy.

964
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:15,683
不 别挑那个 他被感染了
Oh, not that one. He's infected.

965
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,597
- 嗯?  - 你说什么?
- Huh?  - You what?

966
01:09:17,764 --> 01:09:21,860
没错 他肠道里有虫子
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

967
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,028
- 呕!  - 啊!
- Eww!  - Aah!

968
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,524
事实上 他们都被感染了 他们体内长满了寄生虫
In fact, they all have. They're infested with parasites.

969
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:30,694
那真是太可怕了 我可不会冒这种险 绝对不会
It's a terrible business. I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.

970
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,737
寄生虫? 他说了 "寄生虫" ?
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?

971
01:09:32,904 --> 01:09:35,703
我们没有寄生虫 你才有寄生虫呢!
We don't have parasites. You have parasites!

972
01:09:36,407 --> 01:09:38,375
你在说什么呢 小伙子?
What are you talking about, laddie?

973
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:43,790
我的寄生虫和手臂一样粗
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

974
01:09:43,956 --> 01:09:46,550
我的寄生虫最大了 超大号寄生虫
Mine are the biggest parasites. I've got huge parasites.

975
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:50,054
- 我们身上到处都是  - 没错 我全身都是
- We're riddled.  - Yes, I'm riddled.

976
01:09:50,213 --> 01:09:51,510
是的 我们糟透了
Yes, we are, badly.

977
01:09:51,672 --> 01:09:54,551
那么你要我们怎么办?
What would you have us do, then?

978
01:09:54,717 --> 01:09:56,219
放他们走?
Let them all go?

979
01:09:56,677 --> 01:09:59,931
- 这个...  - 你以为我不知道你想干什么?
- Well...  - You think I don't know what you're up to?

980
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,486
这只小耗子把我们当傻子耍呢
This little ferret is taking us for fools.

981
01:10:04,936 --> 01:10:06,483
- 耗子?  - 傻子?
- Ferret?  - Fools?

982
01:10:06,646 --> 01:10:09,570
曙光将把你们全部消灭
The dawn will take you all.

983
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:12,618
- 那是谁?  - 不知道
- Who's that?  - No idea.

984
01:10:12,777 --> 01:10:13,949
我们能把他也吃了吗?
Can we eat him too?

985
01:10:40,096 --> 01:10:42,645
把你的脚从我背上拿开
Get your foot out of my back.

986
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:49,901
啊
Ah.

987
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,323
容我问一句 你之前去哪里了?
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

988
01:10:54,444 --> 01:10:56,162
去前面看看
To look ahead.

989
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:59,331
- 你为什么又回来了?  - 看看后面
- What brought you back?  - Looking behind.

990
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:01,576
真糟糕
Nasty business.

991
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:03,244
幸好 大家都没事
Still, they're all in one piece.

992
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:04,913
你的飞贼可没什么功劳
No thanks to your burglar.

993
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,458
他给你们争取了时间
He had the nous to play for time.

994
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:12,254
你们都没有意识到这点
None of the rest of you thought of that.

995
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:17,262
这些食人妖一定都是从伊顿荒原来的
They must have come down from the Ettenmoors.

996
01:11:17,425 --> 01:11:20,178
从什么时候开始 他们会往南走得这么远?
Since when do Mountain Trolls venture this far south?

997
01:11:20,386 --> 01:11:22,480
哦 没多久
Ooh. Not for an age.

998
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:26,643
就在黑暗势力统治这片土地之后
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

999
01:11:32,523 --> 01:11:36,118
他们不能在白天活动
They could not have moved in daylight.

1000
01:11:36,652 --> 01:11:39,030
这附近一定会有个洞穴
There must be a cave nearby.

1001
01:11:49,665 --> 01:11:51,963
哦 这股臭味是哪来的?
Oh, what's that stench?

1002
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:55,300
这里是食人妖的巢穴
It's a Troll-hoard.

1003
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:58,220
小心你们摸到的东西
Be careful what you touch.

1004
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:13,781
把财宝随意扔放 好像太可惜了
Seems a shame just to leave it lying around.

1005
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:17,819
- 谁都可以拿走  - 同意
- Anyone could take it.  - Agreed.

1006
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:19,658
- 诺力  - 干什么?
- Nori.  - Yeah?

1007
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,197
拿把铲子来
Get a shovel.

1008
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,512
这些剑不是食人妖做的
These swords were not made by any Troll.

1009
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:50,735
也不是人类铁匠做的
Nor were they made by any smith among men.

1010
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:57,529
这些是第一纪的高等精灵...
These were forged in Gondolin...

1011
01:12:57,692 --> 01:13:01,196
在贡多林锻造的
by the High Elves of the First Age.

1012
01:13:01,696 --> 01:13:03,915
没有比这更锋利的刀刃了
You could not wish for a finer blade.

1013
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,718
- 把它埋起来  - 太好了
- Set it down.  - That's good.

1014
01:13:20,673 --> 01:13:22,346
好了 继续 快点
All right, come on. Quick.

1015
01:13:30,683 --> 01:13:33,357
我们也存点长期储蓄
We're making a long-term deposit.

1016
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:35,579
我们快离开这个臭烘烘的地方吧
Let's get out of this foul place.

1017
01:13:36,022 --> 01:13:37,649
走吧 我们走
Come on, let's go.

1018
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:39,825
跟上 波佛 葛罗因 诺力
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

1019
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,013
- 比尔博  - 嗯?
- Bilbo.  - Hmm?

1020
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:03,507
给你
Here.

1021
01:14:03,716 --> 01:14:06,265
这个尺寸正适合你
This is about your size.

1022
01:14:11,932 --> 01:14:13,309
我不能接受它
I can't take this.

1023
01:14:13,684 --> 01:14:15,652
这把剑是精灵制作的...
The blade is of Elvish make...

1024
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:20,825
也就是说当半兽人或哥布林靠近的时候 它会发出蓝色的光
which means it will glow blue when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

1025
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:24,328
我这辈子都没用过剑
I have never used a sword in my life.

1026
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:26,455
我希望你永远用不上它
And I hope you never have to.

1027
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:29,079
但是如果你用到了 要记住
But if you do, remember this:

1028
01:14:30,493 --> 01:14:35,795
真正的勇气 不是体现在杀戮的时候...
True courage is about knowing not when to take a life...

1029
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:38,676
而是宽恕的时候
but when to spare one.

1030
01:14:44,006 --> 01:14:45,553
有什么东西过来了!
Something's coming!

1031
01:14:45,716 --> 01:14:47,844
- 甘道夫  - 聚在一起!
- Gandalf.  - Stay together!

1032
01:14:48,678 --> 01:14:52,057
快点! 拿上武器!
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!

1033
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:13,244
小偷! 大火! 谋杀!
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

1034
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,427
瑞达加斯特
Radagast.

1035
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,804
这是褐袍瑞达加斯特
It's Radagast the Brown.

1036
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,681
那么...
Well...

1037
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,560
你来这里到底要干什么?
What on earth are you doing here?

1038
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:26,270
我在找你 甘道夫
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

1039
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:27,813
出事了
Something's wrong.

1040
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,357
出大事了
Something's terribly wrong.

1041
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,526
怎么了?
Yes?

1042
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,279
哦
Oh.

1043
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,866
稍等一下
Just give me a minute.

1044
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:42,036
哦 我有件事想说 但是我给忘了
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

1045
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,788
它就在...
It was right there...

1046
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,665
我的舌尖上
on the tip of my tongue.

1047
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:46,916
哦
Oh.

1048
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,377
它根本不是一件事
It's not a thought at all.

1049
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,753
它是一只笨笨的...
It's a silly old...

1050
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,257
老竹节虫
stick insect.

1051
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,056
巨绿森林生病了 甘道夫
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

1052
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,684
黑暗已经将它笼罩
A darkness has fallen over it.

1053
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,936
万物都不再生长
Nothing grows anymore.

1054
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,313
至少 美好的东西都不再生长
At least, nothing good.

1055
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,149
空气中弥漫着浑浊的腐臭
The air is foul with decay.

1056
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,110
更糟糕的是蛛网
But worse are the webs.

1057
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,445
蛛网? 什么意思?
Webs? What do you mean?

1058
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,739
蜘蛛 甘道夫
Spiders, Gandalf.

1059
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,324
巨型的蜘蛛
Giant ones.

1060
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:24,870
我肯定是昂哥立安的后代 否则我就不是个巫师
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant, or I am not a Wizard.

1061
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,248
我沿着它们的踪迹
I followed their trail.

1062
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:30,293
追踪到它们来自多尔戈多
They came from Dol Guldur.

1063
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:32,920
啊?
Huh?

1064
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,172
来自多尔戈多?
Dol Guldur?

1065
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,593
但是那座古老的堡垒已经被废弃了
But the old fortress is abandoned.

1066
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,220
不 甘道夫
No, Gandalf.

1067
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,557
那里有人
It's not.

1068
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,568
一股黑暗势力盘踞在那里...
A dark power dwells in there...

1069
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,695
那是我从未感受过的...
Such as I have never...

1070
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,488
黑暗
felt before.

1071
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:05,328
那是远古魔影
It is The Shadow of an ancient horror.

1072
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:14,754
它可以召唤...
One that can summon the spirits...

1073
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:15,921
亡者之灵
of the dead.

1074
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,940
我看到他了 甘道夫
I saw him, Gandalf.

1075
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,736
从黑暗中...
From out of the darkness...

1076
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,029
走出来的是...
a Necromancer...

1077
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,281
一位
has come.

1078
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,409
死灵法师
Radagast.

1079
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,583
快! 快! 快点! 快点!
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

1080
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,420
等等我!
Wait for me!

1081
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:11,977
对不起
Sorry.

1082
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,563
来一口老托比吧
Try a little Old Toby.

1083
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,315
它能帮你放松下来
It'll help settle your nerves.

1084
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,945
吐出来
And out.

1085
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,495
现在好好想想...
Now...

1086
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,207
你确定那是死灵法师吗?
a Necromancer. Are you sure?

1087
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,264
那可不是...
That is not...

1088
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:52,560
来自我们这个世界的东西
from the world of the living.

1089
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:01,235
那是狼吗? 这附近有狼吗?
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves out there?

1090
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,280
狼? 不 那不是一般的狼
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

1091
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,328
奇力! 射箭!
Kili! Get your bow!

1092
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,004
前锋座狼
Warg scouts.

1093
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,214
这说明半兽人的队伍已经不远了
Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.

1094
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,340
半兽人的队伍?
Orc pack?

1095
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,925
除了你的族人之外...
Who did you tell about your quest...

1096
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,343
你还把这次探险的事告诉谁了?
beyond your kin?

1097
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:27,511
谁都没有
No one.

1098
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,429
你到底告诉谁了?
Who did you tell?

1099
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,889
没有 我发誓
No one, I swear.

1100
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,140
以杜林之名...
What in...

1101
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:32,391
告诉我出了什么麻烦?
Durin's name is going on?

1102
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:33,768
你们掉进陷阱了
You are being hunted.

1103
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,687
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here.

1104
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,063
我们没法离开 我们没有小马了
We can't. We have no ponies.

1105
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,900
它们跑散了
They bolted.

1106
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,401
我去引开他们
I'll draw them off.

1107
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:44,361
他们是刚达巴的座狼
These are Gundabad Wargs.

1108
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,529
你跑不过他们的
They will outrun you.

1109
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,615
这些是罗斯加堡的兔子
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

1110
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,036
我倒想让它们比试比试
I'd like to see them try.

1111
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,880
来啊! 来啊!
Come on! Come on!

1112
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,382
来抓我啊! 哈哈!
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

1113
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,310
过来
Come on.

1114
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,256
别走散了
Stay together.

1115
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:46,507
快跑!
Move!

1116
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,229
欧力 停! 回来
Ori, no! Get back.

1117
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,733
所有人 过来 快!
All of you, come on. Quick!

1118
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,905
你要带我们去哪?
Where are you leading us?

1119
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,516
快跑!
Move!

1120
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,935
快!
Run!

1121
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,453
他们在那里!
There they are!

1122
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,081
这边走!
This way!

1123
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:43,374
快点!
Quickly!

1124
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,178
来的越来越多了!
There's more coming!

1125
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:57,846
奇力!
Kili!

1126
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,807
射箭!
Shoot them!

1127
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,813
我们被包围了!
We're surrounded!

1128
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,568
甘道夫在哪里?
Where's Gandalf?

1129
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,946
他抛弃了我们
He's abandoned us.

1130
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,287
稳住阵脚!
Hold your ground!

1131
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:32,881
来这边 你们这些傻瓜!
This way, you fools!

1132
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:35,050
过来 快!
Come on, move!

1133
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,095
快点!
Quickly!

1134
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:39,263
大家都来这里!
All of you!

1135
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,889
过来!
Come on!

1136
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,766
快 快 快!
Go, go, go!

1137
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:54,319
八 九 十
Eight, nine, ten.

1138
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,406
快点! 奇力!
Kili!

1139
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:58,657
快过来!
Run!

1140
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,157
是精灵
Elves.

1141
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,036
我看不出来...
I cannot see...

1142
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:46,914
这条路通向哪里 我们走不走?
where the pathway leads. Do we follow it or no?

1143
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,083
当然要走
Follow it, of course.

1144
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,421
明智的选择
I think that would be wise.

1145
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,487
甘道夫
Gandalf.

1146
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,531
我们这是在哪?
Where are we?

1147
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:21,657
你有感觉?
You can feel it?

1148
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:25,536
是啊 感觉就像是...
Yes. It feels like...

1149
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,496
像是有魔法一样
Well, like magic.

1150
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:30,207
那就对了
That's exactly what it is.

1151
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,293
这是非常强大的魔法
A very powerful magic.

1152
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,380
前面有光
There's light ahead.

1153
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,631
这是伊姆拉崔河谷
The Valley of Imladris.

1154
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:24,219
更多的时候 它有另一个名字
In the common tongue, it's known by another name.

1155
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,555
瑞文戴尔
Rivendell.

1156
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:34,313
这里是大海东岸最后的美丽家园
Here lies the Last Homely House East of the Sea.

1157
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:36,648
这都是你计划好的
This was your plan all along.

1158
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,652
向我们的敌人寻求帮助
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1159
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,156
这里没有你的敌人 索林・橡木盾
You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield.

1160
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,283
如果你在林谷里...
The only ill will to be found...

1161
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,327
感到任何敌意 那也是你自己身上的
in this valley is that which you bring yourself.

1162
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,789
你以为精灵会为我们的探险祝福吗?
You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing?

1163
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,334
他们会阻止我们
They will try to stop us.

1164
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:59,546
没错 但是我们也有疑问需要他们指点
Of course they will. But we have questions that need to be answered.

1165
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:06,637
所以如果我们想成功 和精灵的接触就需要机智
If we are to be successful, this will need to be handled with tact.

1166
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,180
和尊重
And respect.

1167
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,849
以及一定的风度
And no small degree of charm.

1168
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,103
所以待会儿的谈判 就交给我吧
Which is why you will leave the talking to me.

1169
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:12,411
米斯兰迪尔
Mithrandir.

1170
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:14,913
啊
Ah.

1171
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:16,581
林迪尔
Lindir.

1172
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,375
注意点
Stay sharp.

1173
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:20,775
我们听说你来到了幽谷

1174
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,672
我有事得和爱隆谈谈
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1175
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,882
爱隆殿下不在这里
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1176
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,093
不在这里?
Not here?

1177
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:30,095
他在哪?
Where is he?

1178
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,570
靠紧!
Close ranks!

1179
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:11,636
甘道夫
Gandalf.

1180
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,930
爱隆
Lord Elrond.

1181
01:29:14,888 --> 01:29:16,930
我的朋友

1182
01:29:17,388 --> 01:29:18,630
你去哪了?

1183
01:29:18,988 --> 01:29:22,130
我们出去击退了一群南边来的半兽人

1184
01:29:24,988 --> 01:29:27,630
我们在密道附近杀死了几个

1185
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,743
这很奇怪 半兽人离我们的边界这么近
Strange for Orcs to come so close to our borders.

1186
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:38,914
是什么人或者什么事引他们过来的
Something or someone has drawn them near.

1187
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,458
啊 那大概是我们
Ah. That may have been us.

1188
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,758
欢迎你 索恩之子索林
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1189
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:52,386
我想我们没见过
I do not believe we have met.

1190
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,889
你有你祖父的风范
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1191
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,641
索尔统治山脉的时候...
I knew Thror when he ruled...

1192
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:02,062
- 我认识他  - 真的? 他从没提起过你
- Under the Mountain.  - Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1193
01:30:05,292 --> 01:30:08,862
生起炉火 盛上美酒 我们得款待我们的客人(辛达语)
Nartho i noer, toltho i viruvor. Boe i annam vann a nethail vin.

1194
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:15,492
他在说什么?
What is he saying?

1195
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,120
他是在侮辱我们吗?
Does he offer us insult?

1196
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:21,998
不 葛罗因 他要为你们提供食物
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

1197
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:29,714
好吧...
Well...

1198
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,883
这样的话 带路吧
in that case, lead on.

1199
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,261
嘿 来吧
Hey. Come on.

1200
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,389
试试嘛 就吃一口
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1201
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,182
我不喜欢绿叶菜
I don't like green food.

1202
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,351
肉在哪里?
Where's the meat?

1203
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,521
他们这里有薯片吗?
Have they got any chips?

1204
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:46,314
感谢你...
Kind of you...

1205
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:47,941
招待我们
to invite us.

1206
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,693
我都没穿正式的服装
Not really dressed for dinner.

1207
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,111
你从来都没穿过
Well, you never are.

1208
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:13,758
我个人感觉不是太喜欢女精灵 她们太瘦了
I can't say I fancy Elf maids myself, too thin.

1209
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:15,760
她们都有高高的颧骨...
They're all high cheekbones...

1210
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,013
和雪白的皮肤
and creamy skin.

1211
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,639
我觉得她们的头发也不够浓密
Not enough facial hair for me.

1212
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:23,518
不过那边的那个还不错
Although that one there is not bad.

1213
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,313
那不是个女精灵
That's not an Elf maid.

1214
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,035
有点意思
That's funny.

1215
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:55,467
这是奥格瑞斯特 哥布林斩杀者
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

1216
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:57,260
是由我的同族...
A famous blade...

1217
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:02,849
西方高等精灵锻造的著名的宝剑
forged by the High Elves of the West, my kin.

1218
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:05,393
愿它能够帮助你
May it serve you well.

1219
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,436
这是...
And this...

1220
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,021
格兰瑞...
is Glamdring...

1221
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,149
敌击剑 这是...
the Foehammer. Sword...

1222
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,485
贡多林之王的宝剑
of the King of Gondolin.

1223
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,196
这些是为第一纪元的哥布林大战铸造的
These were made for the Goblin Wars of the First Age.

1224
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:17,489
我没有冒犯的意思 年轻人
I wouldn't bother, laddie.

1225
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:21,159
宝剑是以它在战争中的功勋命名的
Swords are named for the great deeds they do in war.

1226
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,662
你什么意思 我的剑没有经历过战争?
What are you saying, my sword hasn't seen battle?

1227
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:26,164
我都不确定它是一把剑
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1228
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,584
它更像是一把拆信刀 真的
More of a letter opener, really.

1229
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,629
- 你是怎么得到这些的?  - 我们是在...
- How did you come by these?  - We found them...

1230
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,131
东方大道上的一个食人妖巢穴找到的...
in a Troll-hoard on the Great East Road...

1231
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:36,633
就在...
shortly before...

1232
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,887
- 我们被半兽人攻击之前  - 你们在...
- we were ambushed by Orcs.  - And what were you doing...

1233
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:43,306
东方大道上干什么?
on the Great East Road?

1234
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:45,684
不好意思
Excuse me.

1235
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:54,901
十三个矮人...
Thirteen Dwarves...

1236
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:56,570
和一个半身人
and a Halfling. Hm.

1237
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,781
真是奇怪的旅行伙伴啊 甘道夫
Strange traveling companions, Gandalf.

1238
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,534
他们都是杜林矮人的后代
These are the descendants of the house of Durin.

1239
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,744
他们出身贵族 行事得体
They're noble, decent folk.

1240
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,622
而且都非常有教养
And they're surprisingly cultured.

1241
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:08,873
他们都非常...
They've got a deep love...

1242
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,668
- 热爱艺术  - 换首曲子 行不行?
- of the arts.  - Change the tune, why don't you?

1243
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,503
我感觉像是在参加葬礼
I feel like I'm at a funeral.

1244
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,130
- 有人死了吗?  - 好吧...
- Did somebody die?  - All right...

1245
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,716
伙计们 看我的
lads. There's only one thing for it.

1246
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:21,678
# 在 #
# There's #

# 古老的灰山脚下 #
# An #

1248
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,225
# 有一个小旅馆 #
# Inn, there's an inn There's a merry old inn #

1249
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:29,144
# 老旧又欢乐的旅馆 #
# Beneath an old gray hill #

1250
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,606
# 那里的人会酿棕色的啤酒 #
# And there they brew a beer so brown The man in the moon #

1251
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,107
# 某个夜晚 月中人来到人间 #
# Himself came down one night #

1252
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:35,233
# 在那里痛饮尽欢 #
# To drink his fill #

1253
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:36,610
# 哦 #
# Oh #

1254
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,278
# 马夫的猫醉醺醺 #
# The ostler has a tipsy cat #

1255
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,238
# 它还会弹五弦琴 #
# That played a five-stringed fiddle #

1256
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:42,449
# 马夫来来回回锯木头 #
# And up and down he saws his bow #

1257
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,242
# 声音时而低 #
# Now squeaking high #

1258
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:47,746
# 时而高 #
# Now purring low #

1259
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,916
# 有时不低也不高 #
# Now sawing in the middle #

1260
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,168
# 也就是说 #
# So #

1261
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:53,918
# 小提琴上有只猫 #
# The cat on the fiddle #

1262
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,379
# 弹奏古怪的歌谣 那酒有起死回生的功效 #
# Played hey-diddle-diddle A drink that'll wake the dead #

1263
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,590
# 他锯木头发出吱吱的声音 他欢乐得不得了 #
# He squeaked and he sawed And he quickened #

1264
01:33:58,841 --> 01:33:59,466
# 旅馆老板和小调 #
# The tune and the landlord #

1265
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:00,425
# 下了他一大跳 #
# Shook the man #

1266
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:01,384
# 回到月亮上 他才说道 #
# In the Moon "It's after #

1267
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,469
# "已经凌晨三点了" #
# Three!" he said #

1268
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,188
我们的事和精灵无关
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1269
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,190
看在上帝的份上 索林...
For goodness sake, Thorin...

1270
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:17,067
- 给他看看地图  - 地图是...
- show him the map.  - It is the legacy...

1271
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:18,568
我祖先的遗物
of my people.

1272
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:22,322
我需要保护它 以及它所承载的秘密
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

1273
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:25,033
你们矮人不要那么固执好吗
Save me from the stubbornness of Dwarves.

1274
01:34:25,284 --> 01:34:28,161
你的骄傲会给你带来麻烦
Your pride will be your downfall.

1275
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:31,247
站在你面前的是在中土世界仅有的几个...
You stand in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth...

1276
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:35,085
能看懂地图的人 把地图给爱隆
who can read that map. Show it to Lord Elrond.

1277
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:43,051
索林 不行
Thorin, no.

1278
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:54,979
是伊鲁柏
Erebor.

1279
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,149
你们为什么...
What is your interest...

1280
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,068
对这张地图感兴趣?
in this map?

1281
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,821
主要是学术方面的原因
It's mainly academic.

1282
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,114
你知道...
As you know...

1283
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:07,867
这样的文物上有时会带有隐含的信息
this sort of artifact sometimes contains hidden text.

1284
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,459
你还能看懂古矮人文 不是吗?
You still read ancient Dwarvish, do you not?

1285
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:23,459
是色斯文(一种基于月相变化的文字)
Cirth Ithil

1286
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,970
月亮文字?
Moon runes?

1287
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,847
原来如此
Of course.

1288
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:31,558
这是很容易被忽视的密码
An easy thing to miss.

1289
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,351
确实如此
Well, in this case, that is true.

1290
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:36,020
要解读月亮文字 必须有和写下密码那天...
Moon runes can only be read by the light of a moon...

1291
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,356
同样季节...
of the same shape and season...

1292
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:40,608
同样月相的月光
as the day on which they were written.

1293
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:43,194
你能读懂它们吗?
Can you read them?

1294
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,827
这些文字是在仲夏夜写的...
These runes were written on a Midsummer's Eve...

1295
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:55,290
在两百年前一弯新月的月光下
by the light of a crescent moon nearly 200 years ago.

1296
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:58,752
看起来你们注定要来到此地
It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell.

1297
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,879
这是你们的命运...
Fate is with you...

1298
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,839
索林・橡木盾 今晚...
Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon...

1299
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,133
同样的月光正在照耀着我们
shines upon us tonight.

1300
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:25,403
"画眉鸟...
"Stand by the...

1301
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:28,990
敲击之时 站在灰色石头旁...
gray stone when the thrush knocks...

1302
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:33,995
杜林日的最后一抹阳光...
and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day...

1303
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:38,541
- 将会落在锁眼上"  - 杜林日?
- will shine upon the keyhole. "  - Durin's Day?

1304
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:42,170
那是矮人的新年 当秋季最后的月光...
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year, when the last moon of autumn...

1305
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:45,215
和冬天第一缕阳光同时出现在天空的时候
and the first sun of winter appear in the sky together.

1306
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,424
这是个坏消息
This is ill news.

1307
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:50,011
夏天就要过去 杜林日马上就要到了
Summer is passing. Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1308
01:36:50,262 --> 01:36:51,471
我们还有时间
We still have time.

1309
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:54,098
- 时间? 干什么?  - 找到入口
- Time? For what?  - To find the entrance.

1310
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:58,061
我们必须要在正确的时间站在正确的位置上
We have to be standing in exactly the right spot at exactly the right time.

1311
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:02,023
那时 也只有那时 我们才能打开大门
Then, and only then, can the door be opened.

1312
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:02,941
所以...
So this is...

1313
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,777
你们的目的 就是进入那座山?
your purpose, to enter the mountain?

1314
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:07,987
是又怎样?
What of it?

1315
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,157
一定有人不赞同这种做法
There are some who would not deem it wise.

1316
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:13,868
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

1317
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:19,916
你不是中土世界唯一的守护者
You are not the only guardian to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1318
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:48,116
大人 那些矮人...

1319
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,616
他们逃走了

1320
01:37:55,071 --> 01:37:59,216
精灵追杀我们 我们...

1321
01:37:59,217 --> 01:38:03,016
我不想听借口

1322
01:38:08,571 --> 01:38:13,116
我想要矮人国王的脑袋!

1323
01:38:13,117 --> 01:38:15,016
我们寡不敌众...

1324
01:38:15,017 --> 01:38:17,216
我们实在没办法了

1325
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:20,916
我差点连命都没了

1326
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:23,916
你最好...

1327
01:38:25,117 --> 01:38:27,216
付出代价

1328
01:38:46,517 --> 01:38:52,316
很快 那群矮人就会自己出现的

1329
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:55,116
传我命令...

1330
01:38:56,517 --> 01:38:59,516
砍下他们脑袋者 重重有赏

1331
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:19,637
没和你的同伴...
Not with your...

1332
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:20,847
在一起?
companions?

1333
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:25,351
呃 没有 应该没人会记得我的
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

1334
01:40:28,313 --> 01:40:32,400
其实大部分人都觉得我根本不应该参加这次旅行
The truth is that most of them don't think I should be on this journey.

1335
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:35,028
真的吗?
Indeed?

1336
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,032
我听说霍比特人都很有毅力
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

1337
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:43,661
真的?
Really?

1338
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:45,747
嗯
Mm.

1339
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:54,130
我还听说他们都很喜欢家的温暖
I've also heard they're fond of the comforts of home.

1340
01:40:57,676 --> 01:41:00,386
我听说精灵的意见一点也不明智
I've heard that it's unwise to seek the council of Elves.

1341
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:03,473
他们的回答总是模棱两可
That they will answer with yes and no.

1342
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:14,901
如果你愿意的话...
You are very welcome to stay here, if that...

1343
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,486
我们非常欢迎你留在这里
is your wish.

1344
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:25,486
厨房表示压力很大 我们的酒也快没了

1345
01:41:25,492 --> 01:41:28,686
你觉得他们还会在这里待多久?

1346
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:31,886
这还说不准

1347
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,520
不 你也干过这样的事 你肯定也干过
No, you did the same thing. It's not like you didn't do it.

1348
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:53,940
朵力! 给 接住它!
Dori! Here, take that.

1349
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:00,113
庞博!
Bombur!

1350
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,007
我当然敢说 我等这个机会...
Of course I was going to tell you. I was waiting...

1351
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:25,054
已经等了很久了 而且 我觉得你应该相信 我知道我在做什么
for this very chance. And really, I think you can trust that I know what I am doing.

1352
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,807
是吗? 那条巨龙已经沉睡了...
Do you? That dragon has slept...

1353
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,600
六十年了
for 60 years.

1354
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,853
如果你唤醒那个巨兽...
What will happen if your plan should fail...

1355
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,814
- 但是你的计划失败...  - 万一我们成功了呢?
- if you wake that beast?  - What if we succeed?

1356
01:42:35,065 --> 01:42:37,150
如果矮人夺回那座山
If the Dwarves take back the mountain...

1357
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,026
我们在东部的防线就会加强
our defenses in the east will be strengthened.

1358
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,612
这一步走的太险了 甘道夫
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.

1359
01:42:41,864 --> 01:42:43,656
什么都不做也很危险
It is also dangerous to do nothing.

1360
01:42:43,907 --> 01:42:48,161
拜托 伊鲁柏的皇冠本来就是属于索林的 你在怕什么?
Oh, come, the throne of Erebor is Thorin's birthright. What is it you fear?

1361
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:49,745
你不记得了吗?
Have you forgotten?

1362
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:53,291
他们家族有发疯的病史
A strain of madness runs deep in that family.

1363
01:42:54,084 --> 01:42:56,752
他的祖父就变得神志不清 他父亲也是被...
His grandfather lost his mind. His father succumbed to...

1364
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,504
同样的疾病缠身
the same sickness.

1365
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:01,257
你敢说 索林・橡木盾...
Can you swear Thorin Oakenshield...

1366
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,301
就不会这样吗?
will not also fall?

1367
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:09,974
甘道夫 我们无需作出这样的决定 中土世界的格局...
Gandalf, these decisions do not rest with us alone. It is not...

1368
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:13,978
不是你我能改变的
up to you or me to redraw the map of Middle-earth.

1369
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:18,649
不管有没有我们的帮助 这些矮人都会向着那座山前进
With or without our help, these Dwarves will march on the mountain.

1370
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,736
他们决心要收复家园
They're determined to reclaim their homeland.

1371
01:43:21,987 --> 01:43:27,074
索林・橡木盾认为做这件事 不需要向任何人交代
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1372
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,951
我也这么认为
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1373
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,705
你不需要向我交待
It is not me you must answer to.

1374
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:46,594
凯兰崔尔夫人
Lady Galadriel.

1375
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,055
米斯兰迪尔
Mithrandir.

1376
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:58,055
时间或许能使我变老...

1377
01:43:58,312 --> 01:44:03,355
但是永远改变不了您 凯兰崔尔夫人

1378
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:10,618
我不知道爱隆请来了您
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1379
01:44:11,536 --> 01:44:13,162
他没有
He didn't.

1380
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,248
是我请的
I did.

1381
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:21,921
哦
Ah.

1382
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:25,091
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

1383
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:29,470
你最近好像很忙 我的朋友
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1384
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,306
告诉我 甘道夫...
Tell me, Gandalf...

1385
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:36,018
你是不是觉得你的计划和方案...
did you think these plans and schemes of yours...

1386
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,104
会无人知晓?
would go unnoticed?

1387
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:40,314
无人知晓?
Unnoticed?

1388
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:42,358
不
No.

1389
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,735
我只是在做我认为对的事情
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1390
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:48,656
那条龙一直让你耿耿于怀
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1391
01:44:49,157 --> 01:44:51,117
确实是 夫人
That is true, my lady.

1392
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:53,661
史矛革不会听命于任何人
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1393
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:56,664
但是如果他和大敌站在一边...
But if he should side with The Enemy...

1394
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:59,750
这条龙会发挥出极其可怕的作用
a dragon could be used to terrible effect.

1395
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,502
什么敌人?
What enemy?

1396
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:05,047
甘道夫 大敌已经被打败了
Gandalf, The Enemy is defeated.

1397
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:10,136
索伦被击溃了 他不可能再恢复原来的力量
Sauron is vanquished. He can never regain his full strength.

1398
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:15,599
你难道从来就没想过 难道最后一枚矮人之戒...
Does it not worry you that the last of the Dwarf rings...

1399
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:17,685
真的随着它的主人...
should simply vanish...

1400
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,937
一起消失了吗?
along with its bearer?

1401
01:45:20,188 --> 01:45:23,899
矮人七戒中有四枚毁于巨龙之焰...
Of the seven Dwarf rings, four were consumed by dragons...

1402
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:27,361
索伦坠入魔多之前拿了两枚
two were taken by Sauron before he fell in Mordor.

1403
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:32,074
最后一枚矮人之戒的下落却无人知晓
The fate of the last Dwarf ring remains unknown.

1404
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,288
也就是索恩戴着的那枚戒指
The ring that was worn by Thrain.

1405
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,498
没有至尊魔戒...
Without the ruling Ring of Power...

1406
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,376
那七戒对于大敌来说也毫无用处
the seven are of no value to The Enemy.

1407
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,254
要控制...
To control...

1408
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:46,630
其他的戒指...
the other rings...

1409
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:50,551
他就需要那唯一一枚魔戒
he needs the One.

1410
01:45:50,802 --> 01:45:53,346
而魔戒在很久很久之前就已经消失了
And that ring was lost long, long ago.

1411
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:54,555
它被安都因河的水...
It was swept out...

1412
01:45:54,806 --> 01:45:57,266
冲向了大海
to sea by the waters of the Anduin.

1413
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:02,605
甘道夫 四百年来我们一直生活在和平之中...
Gandalf, for 400 years we have lived in peace...

1414
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,357
我们小心翼翼维持着...
a hard-won...

1415
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:05,858
这来之不易的和平
watchful peace.

1416
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:08,819
是吗? 我们生活在和平之中吗?
Are we? Are we at peace?

1417
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:14,283
食人妖从山上来到平原 他们洗劫村庄 摧毁农田
Trolls have come down from the mountains. They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1418
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:17,578
半兽人在路上袭击了我们
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1419
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:19,580
这些并不是大战的序幕
Hardly a prelude to war.

1420
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:21,999
你总是喜欢多管闲事...
Always you must meddle...

1421
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:24,168
杞人忧天
looking for trouble where none exists.

1422
01:46:24,419 --> 01:46:26,545
让他说下去
Let him speak.

1423
01:46:27,672 --> 01:46:32,593
还有一种超越史矛革的邪恶势力在活动
There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug.

1424
01:46:32,844 --> 01:46:35,137
一种更加强大的力量
Something far more powerful.

1425
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:41,394
我们可以视而不见 但是我敢保证 它绝对不会放过我们
We can remain blind to it, but it will not be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1426
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:43,521
巨绿森林里藏着一股邪恶的力量
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1427
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:47,400
住在森林里的樵夫 改称那儿为幽暗密林
The woodsmen who live there now call it Mirkwood.

1428
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:48,984
他们说...
And they say...

1429
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:51,987
说什么?
Well?

1430
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,031
别停啊
Don't stop now.

1431
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:56,534
告诉我们樵夫是怎么说的
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1432
01:46:56,785 --> 01:46:59,036
他们说有个死灵法师
They speak of a Necromancer...

1433
01:46:59,287 --> 01:47:00,413
住在多尔戈多
living in Dol Guldur.

1434
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:03,624
他会召唤亡灵
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1435
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,209
真是荒唐
That's absurd.

1436
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,212
这世间根本没这种力量
No such power exists in this world.

1437
01:47:08,463 --> 01:47:12,508
这个死灵法师不过是一个凡人
This Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man.

1438
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:15,302
一个涉足黑魔法的方士罢了
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1439
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:17,054
我也是这么想的
And so I thought too.

1440
01:47:17,305 --> 01:47:20,724
- 但是瑞达加斯特看到...  - 瑞达加斯特?
- But Radagast has seen...  - Radagast?

1441
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:24,270
别跟我提褐袍瑞达加斯特
Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown.

1442
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:26,272
他很愚蠢
He's a foolish fellow.

1443
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:30,651
我同意 他确实有点奇怪 因为他过着隐居生活
Well, he's odd, I grant you. He lives a solitary life.

1444
01:47:30,902 --> 01:47:33,112
不是因为这个 肯定是他...
It's not that. It's his excessive...

1445
01:47:33,363 --> 01:47:35,239
过分食用迷幻蘑菇
consumption of mushrooms.

1446
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:37,158
导致神志不清...
They've addled his brain...

1447
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,827
牙齿发黄
and yellowed his teeth.

1448
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:41,620
我警告过他
I've warned him.

1449
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,040
一个巫师老是在森林里闲逛可没有好处...
It is unbefitting one of the Istari to be wandering the woods...

1450
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,918
你带着一件东西
You carry something.

1451
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:52,006
是瑞达加斯特给你的
It came to you from Radagast.

1452
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:55,468
他在多尔戈多找到的
He found it in Dol Guldur.

1453
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:57,761
是
Yes.

1454
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:00,806
拿出来
Show me.

1455
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,476
听我说
listen to me.

1456
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:07,480
他根本就没仔细听 我都觉得是我在自言自语了
I would think I was talking to myself for all the attention that he paid.

1457
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,690
无论如何...
By all means...

1458
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:11,901
那是什么?
What is that?

1459
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:16,530
是魔多的遗迹
A relic of Mordor.

1460
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,959
魔古尔剑
A Morgul Blade.

1461
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:32,296
是为安格玛巫王所铸
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1462
01:48:32,547 --> 01:48:35,674
并随他下葬
And buried with him.

1463
01:48:37,802 --> 01:48:39,803
安格玛死后
When Angmar fell...

1464
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:42,598
北方的人类带走了他的遗体...
the Men of the North took his body...

1465
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:46,810
和所有的遗产 葬于鲁道尔群山
and all that he possessed and sealed it within the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1466
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:49,980
他们将他葬在山下...
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1467
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,567
墓穴深埋...
in a tomb so dark...

1468
01:48:54,152 --> 01:48:55,694
永无天日
it would never come to light.

1469
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,072
这不可能
This is not possible.

1470
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:01,742
墓穴里有强大的魔咒
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1471
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:03,786
是不可能被打开的
They cannot be opened.

1472
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:08,832
你有什么证据证明这把剑出自安格玛的坟墓?
What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar's grave?

1473
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,501
没有证据
I have none.

1474
01:49:10,752 --> 01:49:12,253
因为这根本就是臆想
Because there is none.

1475
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:15,381
我来说说现在知道些什么
Let us examine what we know.

1476
01:49:16,174 --> 01:49:18,342
一群半兽人...
A single Orc pack...

1477
01:49:18,593 --> 01:49:20,844
胆大妄为 穿越了布鲁南河
has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1478
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,682
一把古老的匕首
A dagger from a bygone age has been found.

1479
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:30,229
还有一个住在废弃堡垒里...
And a human sorcerer who calls himself "The Necromancer"...

1480
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:34,358
自称是"死灵法师"的人类方士
has taken up residence in a ruined fortress.

1481
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:38,946
算算也没多少
It's not so very much after all.

1482
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:42,491
但对这群矮人...
The question of this Dwarvish company, however...

1483
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,368
我深感忧虑
troubles me deeply.

1484
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:46,245
你还没有说服我 甘道夫
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1485
01:49:46,496 --> 01:49:49,915
我觉得我无法容忍这次远征
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1486
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:54,503
如果他们来找我 我就不会先让他们有希望 再失望
If they'd come to me, I might have spared them this disappointment.

1487
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:57,798
我没法假装自己明白你燃起他们希望的缘由
I do not pretend to understand your reason for raising their hopes.

1488
01:49:58,049 --> 01:49:59,675
他们走了
They are leaving.

1489
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:03,721
没错
Yes.

1490
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:07,474
你早就计划好了
You knew.

1491
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:13,147
不 我想这件事...
No, I'm afraid there is...

1492
01:50:13,398 --> 01:50:15,482
没有其他意义了
nothing else for it.

1493
01:50:17,485 --> 01:50:18,360
爱隆殿下
My Lord Elrond.

1494
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:22,364
那些矮人走了
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1495
01:50:27,662 --> 01:50:29,538
大家提高警惕
Be on your guard.

1496
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:32,082
我们马上就要走出边境了
We're about to step over the Edge of the Wild.

1497
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:34,918
巴林 你认识路 你走最前面
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1498
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:36,754
好
Aye.

1499
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:43,385
巴金斯先生...
Master Baggins...

1500
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:46,722
我建议你快跟上
I suggest you keep up.

1501
01:51:00,236 --> 01:51:01,236
你会跟随他们
You will follow them.

1502
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:03,155
是
Yes.

1503
01:51:03,406 --> 01:51:06,450
帮助索林・橡木盾是对的
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield.

1504
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:09,870
但我怕这次远征会唤出...
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

1505
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:13,415
那些未知的势力
forces we do not yet understand.

1506
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:17,670
魔古尔剑为何出现 必须找到原因
The riddle of the Morgul Blade must be answered.

1507
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:21,382
有股势力正在暗处滋长 避开了我们的耳目
Something moves in the shadows unseen, hidden from our sight.

1508
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,592
他们不会轻易现身
It will not show itself.

1509
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:25,552
还不会
Not yet.

1510
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:28,555
但他们的力量与日俱增
But every day it grows in strength.

1511
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:30,516
你得小心
You must be careful.

1512
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:36,230
米斯兰迪尔?
Mithrandir?

1513
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:40,526
为什么选了半身人?
Why the Halfling?

1514
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:44,446
我不知道
I do not know.

1515
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,953
萨鲁曼认为只有拥有强大力量的人...
Saruman believes that it is only great power...

1516
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:54,081
才能与邪恶对抗
that can hold evil in check.

1517
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,042
但我不敢苟同
But that is not what I have found.

1518
01:51:58,169 --> 01:52:01,839
我发现真正驱走黑暗的...
I have found it is the small things...

1519
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:04,383
是平凡的人们
everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1520
01:52:04,634 --> 01:52:07,594
怀着仁慈与爱意之心
that keeps the darkness at bay.

1521
01:52:08,304 --> 01:52:11,598
所做的平凡而微小的事迹
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1522
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:16,353
为什么选了比尔博・巴金斯?
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1523
01:52:18,773 --> 01:52:21,483
也许是因为我感到害怕...
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1524
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:25,821
而他给了我勇气
and he gives me courage.

1525
01:52:30,618 --> 01:52:33,787
别害怕 米斯兰迪尔
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1526
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:37,124
你不是孤身一人
You are not alone.

1527
01:52:41,749 --> 01:52:43,124
无论你何时需要我的帮助...

1528
01:52:43,149 --> 01:52:45,124
我会来的

1529
01:54:17,392 --> 01:54:20,102
小心! 抓紧了
Hey! Hold on!

1530
01:54:26,317 --> 01:54:27,150
啊!
Aah!

1531
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:28,443
比尔博!
Bilbo!

1532
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,905
我们得找个...
We must find...

1533
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:33,866
避雨的地方!
shelter!

1534
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:35,617
小心!
Look out!

1535
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:42,875
小心 兄弟!
Look out, brother!

1536
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,252
抓紧!
Hold on!

1537
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:50,716
这根本不是雷暴
This is no thunderstorm.

1538
01:54:51,259 --> 01:54:53,635
这是场战争!
It's a thunder-battle!

1539
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:55,596
看!
Look!

1540
01:55:00,643 --> 01:55:02,603
天啊
Well, bless me.

1541
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:04,563
传说是真的
The legends are true.

1542
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:08,734
巨人! 石头巨人!
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1543
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:16,700
躲好 傻瓜!
Take cover, you fool!

1544
01:55:18,786 --> 01:55:20,495
抓紧!
Hold on!

1545
01:55:28,796 --> 01:55:29,796
怎么回事?
What's happening?

1546
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:31,214
抓住我的手!
Grab my hand!

1547
01:55:55,156 --> 01:55:56,114
快 快 快!
Go, go, go!

1548
01:55:56,366 --> 01:55:57,032
快跑! 跳过去!
Run! Get off!

1549
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:58,367
跳过去!
Get off!

1550
01:56:02,455 --> 01:56:03,997
- 快跑!  - 小心!
- Run!  - Hold on!

1551
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:10,754
小心!
Look out!

1552
01:56:31,901 --> 01:56:33,443
跳!
Jump!

1553
01:56:33,695 --> 01:56:34,820
快点!
Come on!

1554
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:40,283
抓紧!
Hold on!

1555
01:56:48,376 --> 01:56:49,042
不!
No!

1556
01:56:50,753 --> 01:56:52,254
不!
No!

1557
01:57:01,014 --> 01:57:01,680
不!
No!

1558
01:57:01,931 --> 01:57:03,348
奇力!
Kili!

1559
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:11,648
没事! 他们还活着!
It's all right! They're alive!

1560
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:14,026
比尔博在哪?
Where's Bilbo?

1561
01:57:14,652 --> 01:57:15,652
那个霍比特人呢?
Where's the Hobbit?

1562
01:57:17,238 --> 01:57:17,946
在那!
There!

1563
01:57:21,492 --> 01:57:22,409
快去拉他!
Get him!

1564
01:57:23,745 --> 01:57:24,745
啊!
Aah!

1565
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:25,662
抓住我的手!
Grab my hand!

1566
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:26,580
比尔博!
Bilbo!

1567
01:57:28,624 --> 01:57:29,666
欧力 小心!
Ori, be careful!

1568
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:31,043
抓住!
Take it!

1569
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:32,461
我抓牢你了 伙计
I've got you, lad.

1570
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:33,754
抓紧! 抓紧!
Grab on! Grab on!

1571
01:57:43,931 --> 01:57:44,639
快
Come on.

1572
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:46,683
抓紧他
Get him.

1573
01:57:46,934 --> 01:57:48,602
加油 伙计 爬上来
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1574
01:57:51,773 --> 01:57:53,273
我以为我们的飞贼会死呢
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1575
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:57,235
他离开家乡就死定了
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1576
01:57:58,071 --> 01:57:59,780
他就不该跟着我们
He should never have come.

1577
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:02,032
他在我们中间没有位置
He has no place amongst us.

1578
01:58:03,951 --> 01:58:05,410
德瓦林!
Dwalin!

1579
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:12,709
看上去挺安全的
It looks safe enough.

1580
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,211
到深处搜查一下
Search to the back.

1581
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:17,464
山洞往往都是有主人的
Caves in the mountain are seldom unoccupied.

1582
01:58:20,968 --> 01:58:22,928
这儿什么都没有
There's nothing here.

1583
01:58:24,806 --> 01:58:26,848
那好吧 大家生火
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1584
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,935
不 在这儿不能生火
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1585
01:58:30,186 --> 01:58:31,812
大家休息一会
Get some sleep.

1586
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:34,231
天一亮 我们就出发
We start at first light.

1587
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:38,360
我们应该在山里等着甘道夫来汇合
We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalfjoined us.

1588
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:39,903
这是计划
That was the plan.

1589
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:41,488
计划变了
Plans change.

1590
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:45,200
波佛 你守第一岗
Bofur, take the first watch.

1591
01:59:59,233 --> 01:59:59,900
你要...
Where do you think...

1592
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:01,651
去哪儿?
you're going?

1593
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:05,739
回瑞文戴尔去
Back to Rivendell.

1594
02:00:06,908 --> 02:00:09,159
不 不 你不能现在回去 对吧?
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1595
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:10,660
你属于远征队
You're part of the company.

1596
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:12,287
是我们中的一员
You're one of us.

1597
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:13,830
但我不是 对吧?
I'm not, though, am I?

1598
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:18,168
索林说我就不该跟来的 他说对了
Thorin said I should never have come and he was right.

1599
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:19,961
我不姓图克...
I'm not a Took...

1600
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:23,173
我姓巴金斯 不知道当时我在想什么
I'm a Baggins. I don't know what I was thinking.

1601
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:26,218
我就不该出家门的
I should never have run out my door.

1602
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:28,637
你想家了 我明白
You're homesick. I understand.

1603
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:31,306
不 你一点都不明白 你们都不明白
No, you don't. You don't understand. None of you do.

1604
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:34,184
你们是矮人 习惯了这种生活
You're Dwarves. You're used to this life.

1605
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:35,644
风餐露宿...
To living on the road...

1606
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:38,188
居无定所 毫无归宿!
never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere!

1607
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:43,777
哦 抱歉 我无意...
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

1608
02:00:49,533 --> 02:00:51,117
不 你说得对
No, you're right.

1609
02:00:54,538 --> 02:00:56,456
我们没有归宿
We don't belong anywhere.

1610
02:01:04,757 --> 02:01:07,008
我祝你能一路顺风
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1611
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,263
是真心的
I really do.

1612
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:16,935
那是什么?
What's that?

1613
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:21,106
什么?
Hmm?

1614
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:41,001
快醒醒!
Wake up!

1615
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:42,043
都醒醒!
Wake up!

1616
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:43,295
哇!
Whoa!

1617
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:06,609
小心! 小心！
Look out! Look out!

1618
02:02:10,823 --> 02:02:11,489
滚!
Get away!

1619
02:02:16,537 --> 02:02:17,203
肮脏的畜生!
Filthy scum!

1620
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:19,247
退后!
Get back!

1621
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,086
你会付出代价的!
You'll pay for this!

1622
02:02:32,428 --> 02:02:34,054
抓住你了
Got you.

1623
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:36,598
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

1624
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:41,853
放开我! 把你的手拿开! 放开我!
Get off! Get your hands off me! Get off me!

1625
02:02:47,401 --> 02:02:48,568
放开我!
Get off me!

1626
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:33,965
我想出了一首歌
I feel a song coming on.

1627
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,887
# 喀拉 噼啪 黑色裂缝咔嚓嚓 #
# Clap, snap, the black crack #

1628
02:04:39,138 --> 02:04:41,556
# 一抓 二拉 捉过来了捏着耍 #
# Grip, grab, pinch and nab #

1629
02:04:41,807 --> 02:04:43,433
# 梆梆捣烂继续打 #
# Batter and beat #

1630
02:04:43,684 --> 02:04:46,186
# 让他们结巴 #
# Make'em stammer and #

1631
02:04:46,437 --> 02:04:47,896
# 叫得哇哇哇 #
# Squeak #

1632
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:53,026
# 绕来 绕去 远远 #
# Pound, pound, far #

1633
02:04:53,277 --> 02:04:58,615
# 在地下 #
# Underground #

1634
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,911
# 哥布林城深深埋地下 #
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1635
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:04,996
# 哥布林城深深埋地下 #
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1636
02:05:05,247 --> 02:05:08,333
# 呼咻 啪啦 鞭子抽打 #
# With a swish and a smack and a whip and a crack #

1637
02:05:08,584 --> 02:05:11,294
# 人人上了我的刑台都爱说话 #
# Everybody talks when they're on my rack #

1638
02:05:11,545 --> 02:05:14,839
# 绕来 绕去 远远在地下 #
# Pound,pound, far underground #

1639
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:17,842
# 哥布林城深深埋地下 #
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1640
02:05:18,093 --> 02:05:20,720
# 哥布林城深深埋地下 #
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1641
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:23,598
# 拿出锤子 举起钳子 带上凿子和铜锣 #
# Hammer and tongs get out your knockers and gongs #

1642
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:29,062
# 在我的叉齿上你活不了多长 #
# You won't last long on the end of my prong #

1643
02:05:29,772 --> 02:05:31,189
# 咚咙 哐啷 #
# Clash, crash #

1644
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:32,899
# 哗啦 啪嗒 #
# Crush and smash #

1645
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:35,443
# 乒乒乓乓 吓得你全身打架 #
# Bang, break, shiver and shake #

1646
02:05:35,694 --> 02:05:39,822
# 任你抱怨大吼 没人会来搭救 #
# You can yammer and yelp, but there ain't no help#

1647
02:05:40,407 --> 02:05:45,078
# 绕来 绕去 远远在地下 #
# Pound, pound, far underground #

1648
02:05:45,913 --> 02:05:49,040
# 哥布林城深深... #
# Down, down, down in Goblin... #

1649
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:52,210
# 埋地下 #
# Town #

1650
02:05:57,091 --> 02:05:59,592
耶!
Yeah!

1651
02:06:08,811 --> 02:06:10,562
好听吧?
Catchy, isn't it?

1652
02:06:10,896 --> 02:06:14,315
我自己作曲的
It's one of my own compositions.

1653
02:06:14,733 --> 02:06:16,109
这哪里是歌
That's not a song.

1654
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,027
简直糟糕透顶!
It's an abomination!

1655
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:19,237
糟糕
Abomination.

1656
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:21,948
古怪 差异
Mutations. Deviations.

1657
02:06:22,199 --> 02:06:25,076
这地底下满是这些东西
That's all you're gonna find down here.

1658
02:06:28,998 --> 02:06:34,335
是谁胆敢全副武装 闯进我的王国?
Who would be so bold as to come armed into my kingdom?

1659
02:06:34,628 --> 02:06:35,545
是间谍?
Spies?

1660
02:06:35,796 --> 02:06:36,713
小偷?
Thieves?

1661
02:06:36,964 --> 02:06:38,047
还是杀手?
Assassins?

1662
02:06:38,299 --> 02:06:39,924
是矮人 陛下
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.

1663
02:06:40,175 --> 02:06:41,217
矮人?
Dwarves?

1664
02:06:42,094 --> 02:06:43,761
我们在入口那里抓到的
We found them on the Front Porch.

1665
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,764
那就别傻站着 搜他们的身
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

1666
02:06:48,517 --> 02:06:49,642
角角落落
Every crack.

1667
02:06:49,893 --> 02:06:51,060
好好搜搜
Every crevice.

1668
02:06:57,776 --> 02:06:58,693
我相信...
It is my belief...

1669
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:01,237
尊贵的大王 他们...
your great protuberance, that they...

1670
02:07:01,488 --> 02:07:03,197
和精灵是一伙的!
are in league with Elves!

1671
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:07,118
"瑞文戴尔铸造" 啊
"Made in Rivendell. " Ah.

1672
02:07:07,494 --> 02:07:10,455
第二纪的东西 送也送不掉
Second Age. Couldn't give it away.

1673
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:15,835
只是些纪念品
Just a couple of keepsakes.

1674
02:07:16,086 --> 02:07:18,212
你们到我的地盘上做什么?
What are you doing in these parts?

1675
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:23,343
别担心 兄弟们 我来处理
Uh, don't worry, lads. I'll handle this.

1676
02:07:23,594 --> 02:07:24,886
他... 他要做什么?
What's... What's that?

1677
02:07:25,137 --> 02:07:29,891
不准耍花招 我要听实话 毫无隐瞒
No tricks. I want the truth, warts and all.

1678
02:07:30,142 --> 02:07:32,727
麻烦再说响一点
You're going to have to speak up.

1679
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:35,396
你的手下踩扁了我的助听喇叭
Your boys flattened my trumpet.

1680
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,732
我会踩扁的可不止你的喇叭!
I'll flatten more than your trumpet!

1681
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,487
如果你要更多消息 就该跟我谈
If it's more information you want, I'm the one you should speak to.

1682
02:07:44,156 --> 02:07:44,864
嗯哼
Mm-hm.

1683
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:51,663
我们本来在路上走 不是大路啦 比较像小路
We were on the road. Well, it's not so much a road as a path.

1684
02:07:51,914 --> 02:07:54,374
其实想想 连小路也算不上 顶多是条小径
It's not even that, come to think of it. More like a track.

1685
02:07:54,708 --> 02:07:58,127
重点是 我们在这条像小路 又像小径的路上走
Anyway, the point is, we were on this road, like a path, like a track.

1686
02:07:58,379 --> 02:08:01,756
结果就遇到了问题 因为我们本该...
And then we weren't, which is a problem, because we were...

1687
02:08:02,007 --> 02:08:03,091
- 在上礼拜二...  - 闭嘴
- supposed to be in Dunland...  - Shut up.

1688
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:04,509
就到登兰德的(离此处脚程约...1个月)

1689
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,260
是去拜访远亲
Visiting distant relations.

1690
02:08:06,762 --> 02:08:08,471
我妈妈那边的亲戚
Some inbreds on me mother's side.

1691
02:08:08,722 --> 02:08:10,181
闭嘴!
Shut up!

1692
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,896
如果他们不开口 我们就想办法撬开他们的嘴
If they will not talk, we'll make them squawk.

1693
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:19,107
把绞肉机搬过来
Bring up the mangler.

1694
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:22,110
还有碎骨锤

1695
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:23,486
从最年轻的开始

1696
02:08:24,279 --> 02:08:25,446
等等!
Wait!

1697
02:08:27,991 --> 02:08:30,785
哎呀 看看 看看
Well, well, well.

1698
02:08:31,495 --> 02:08:32,662
看看是谁来了
Look who it is.

1699
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:38,209
原来是索林呀 索恩之子 索尔之孙...
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1700
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:42,088
山丘之王
King Under the Mountain.

1701
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:46,884
哦 但我忘了 你已经没有山了
Oh, but I'm forgetting. You don't have a mountain.

1702
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,678
也不是国王...
And you're not a king...

1703
02:08:48,929 --> 02:08:49,971
那你其实就是个...
which makes you...

1704
02:08:51,306 --> 02:08:53,224
无名小卒
nobody, really.

1705
02:08:56,645 --> 02:09:01,482
我知道有人悬赏了一笔可观的赏金 要买你的脑袋
I know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head.

1706
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:04,235
就一颗脑袋
Just a head.

1707
02:09:04,486 --> 02:09:06,154
别的不要
Nothing attached.

1708
02:09:07,948 --> 02:09:10,700
也许你知道我说的是谁
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

1709
02:09:11,285 --> 02:09:13,995
你的宿敌

1710
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:20,960
骑着白色座狼的苍白半兽人
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1711
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:25,715
毁灭者阿索格已经死了
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1712
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,344
他在很久之前的一战中已经死了
He was slain in battle long ago.

1713
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:34,307
所以你觉得他已经不能兴风作浪了 对吧?
So you think his defiling days are done, do you?

1714
02:09:36,435 --> 02:09:38,853
给苍白半兽人传话
Send word to the pale Orc.

1715
02:09:39,104 --> 02:09:41,773
跟他说我抓到了他要的人
Tell him I have found his prize.

1716
02:10:19,603 --> 02:10:20,686

恶心的哥布林!

但总比陈年骨头好 宝贝

骨头太多了 宝贝 都没多少肉!

1726
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:47,440
闭嘴! 把它的皮扒下来
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1727
02:11:48,442 --> 02:11:49,358
从它的头开始
Start with its head.

1728
02:11:55,782 --> 02:11:59,493
# 冰冷的地面 磨破了我们的手 #
# The cold hard lands. They bites our hands #

1729
02:11:59,745 --> 02:12:02,997
# 折磨着我们的脚 #
# They gnaws our feet #

1730
02:12:03,248 --> 02:12:07,293
# 岩石和石块 就跟陈骨头一般 #

1731
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,087
# 根本没有肉 #

1732
02:12:10,339 --> 02:12:13,716
# 冰冷如尸体 全无气息 #

1733

# 就能吃了 #

1734
02:12:54,466 --> 02:12:56,759
神还真是保佑我们...

1735
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:58,636

前进!
Post!

1965
02:26:50,635 --> 02:26:51,718
向前冲!
Charge!

1966
02:27:38,641 --> 02:27:39,307
砍断绳子!
Cut the ropes!

1967
02:28:03,207 --> 02:28:04,374

跟我来!
Come on!

1976
02:29:26,082 --> 02:29:27,040
小心背后!
Watch your backs!

1977
02:29:27,291 --> 02:29:29,834
还想逃过我的手心
You thought you could escape me.

1978
02:29:33,464 --> 02:29:35,924
你现在还想干什么 巫师?
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1979
02:29:44,392 --> 02:29:45,475
还真有两下子
That'll do it.

1980
02:30:20,886 --> 02:30:23,388
好了 这还不算最糟的呢
Well, that could have been worse.

1981
02:30:24,056 --> 02:30:24,848
乌鸦嘴!
Haver!

1982
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,435
开什么玩笑!
You've got to be joking!

1983
02:30:34,358 --> 02:30:35,025
甘道夫!
Gandalf!

1984
02:30:40,406 --> 02:30:42,574
他们太多了 我们打不过
There's too many. We can't fight them.

1985
02:30:42,825 --> 02:30:44,826
只有一样东西可以救我们 阳光!
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

1986
02:30:45,077 --> 02:30:46,244
快点!
Come on!

1987
02:30:46,495 --> 02:30:47,495
抓住我! 站起来

1988
02:30:50,583 --> 02:30:52,751
- 巴林  - 快!
- Balin.  - Come on!

1989
02:30:54,628 --> 02:30:55,962
慢着!
Wait!

1990
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:59,049
我的宝贝 等等我!
My precious. Wait!

1991
02:30:59,884 --> 02:31:02,469

This way.

1994
02:31:14,899 --> 02:31:18,026
- 跟上  - 快 跟上 快
- Come on.  - Come on, come on. Quickly.

1995
02:31:20,654 --> 02:31:22,363
没错 很好!
Right, good!

1996
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:50,785
巴金斯!
Baggins!

1997
02:32:52,121 --> 02:32:54,080
小偷!
Thief!

1998
02:32:54,957 --> 02:32:59,460
诅咒他粉碎他! 我们永远恨他!
Curse it and crush it! We hates it forever!

1999
02:33:12,808 --> 02:33:15,268
五 六 七 八
Five, six, seven, eight.

2000
02:33:15,728 --> 02:33:17,937
毕佛 波佛 十个了
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

2001
02:33:18,189 --> 02:33:20,648
菲力 奇力! 十二个
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

2002
02:33:20,983 --> 02:33:24,152
还有庞博 加起来十三个
And Bombur. That makes 13.

2003
02:33:24,904 --> 02:33:26,196
比尔博去哪了?
Where's Bilbo?

2004
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:29,073
我们的霍比特人呢?
Where is our Hobbit?

2005
02:33:30,201 --> 02:33:31,743
我们的霍比特人在哪儿?
Where is our Hobbit?

2006
02:33:33,245 --> 02:33:34,162
诅咒那个半身人!
Curse that Halfling!

2007
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:36,122
现在他丢了?
Now he's lost?

2008
02:33:36,373 --> 02:33:37,707
我以为他和朵力在一起!
I thought he was with Dori!

2009
02:33:38,542 --> 02:33:39,542
别怪我!
Don't blame me!

2010
02:33:39,793 --> 02:33:40,877
你最后见他是在哪?
Where did you last see him?

2011
02:33:41,128 --> 02:33:41,794
我记得他...
I think I saw him...

2012
02:33:42,046 --> 02:33:42,754
第一次被包围时...
slip away...

2013
02:33:43,005 --> 02:33:43,713
就溜走了
when they first collared us.

2014
02:33:43,964 --> 02:33:45,340
到底发生了什么?
And what happened, exactly?

2015
02:33:45,591 --> 02:33:47,842
- 告诉我!  - 我来告诉你发生了什么
- Tell me!  - I'll tell you what happened.

2016
02:33:48,093 --> 02:33:49,677
巴金斯先生趁乱...
Master Baggins saw his chance...

2017
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:50,845
逃走了
and he took it.

2018
02:33:51,722 --> 02:33:54,224
自从他踏出家门...
He has thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

2019
02:33:54,642 --> 02:33:57,268
他一心只想柔软的床和温暖的壁炉
since first he stepped out of his door.

2020
02:33:57,519 --> 02:33:59,812
我们不会再见到我们的霍比特人了
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

2021
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:02,065
他早就走远了
He is long gone.

2022
02:34:14,245 --> 02:34:14,953
不
No.

2023
02:34:16,247 --> 02:34:16,913
他没有
He isn't.

2024
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:22,460
比尔博・巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins.

2025
02:34:23,045 --> 02:34:24,170
我这辈子从没有...
I have never been so glad...

2026
02:34:24,421 --> 02:34:26,005
这么高兴见到谁过
to see anyone in my life.

2027
02:34:28,008 --> 02:34:28,675
比尔博
Bilbo.

2028
02:34:29,176 --> 02:34:29,884
我们都放弃你了
We'd given you up.

2029
02:34:30,135 --> 02:34:32,053
你是怎么逃出来的?
How on earth did you get past the Goblins?

2030
02:34:32,304 --> 02:34:33,846
真的 怎么会
How, indeed.

2031
02:34:43,023 --> 02:34:45,984
这个 有什么关系呢? 他回来就好
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

2032
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:47,986
有关系
It matters.

2033
02:34:48,612 --> 02:34:49,946
我想知道
I want to know.

2034
02:34:52,157 --> 02:34:53,866
你为什么回来?
Why did you come back?

2035
02:34:57,204 --> 02:35:00,290
听着 我知道你不信任我 一直都是
Look, I know you doubt me. I know you always have.

2036
02:35:02,501 --> 02:35:04,585
而你是对的 我经常想念我的袋底洞
And you're right. I often think of Bag-end.

2037
02:35:05,379 --> 02:35:07,213
想念我的书
I miss my books.

2038
02:35:08,173 --> 02:35:10,717
还有我的扶手椅 我的花园
And my armchair and my garden.

2039
02:35:11,969 --> 02:35:13,303
懂了吧 那才是我的归属
See, that's where I belong.

2040
02:35:14,013 --> 02:35:15,722
我的家
That's home.

2041
02:35:17,474 --> 02:35:19,559
这也是我回来的原因 因为...
And that's why I came back. Because...

2042
02:35:21,895 --> 02:35:24,772
你们还没有家
you don't have one. A home.

2043
02:35:25,441 --> 02:35:27,025
它被人侵占了
It was taken from you.

2044
02:35:30,112 --> 02:35:32,655
但我会帮你们夺回来的 尽我的能力
But I will help you take it back if I can.

2045
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:57,013
追杀他们!

2046
02:35:57,623 --> 02:36:00,443
把他们撕成碎片!

2047
02:36:06,148 --> 02:36:07,565
才出虎口
Out of the frying pan.

2048
02:36:07,816 --> 02:36:10,109
又入狼窝 跑
And into the fire. Run.

2049
02:36:10,444 --> 02:36:11,527
快跑!
Run!

2050
02:36:27,586 --> 02:36:28,252
快!
Go!

2051
02:36:56,156 --> 02:36:56,823
上树!
Up into the trees!

2052
02:36:57,074 --> 02:36:58,032
所有人!
All of you!

2053
02:36:58,283 --> 02:36:59,534
爬树! 比尔博 快爬!
Climb! Bilbo, climb!

2054
02:37:00,244 --> 02:37:00,910
快点!
Quickly!

2055
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:12,672
他们要来了!
They're coming!

2056
02:37:51,211 --> 02:37:52,879
- 抓紧!  - 抓紧 兄弟们!
- Hang on!  - Hold on, brothers!

2057
02:38:14,359 --> 02:38:15,818
阿索格
Azog.

2058
02:38:21,315 --> 02:38:24,683
你闻到了吗?

2059
02:38:25,315 --> 02:38:27,983
恐惧的味道?

2060
02:38:31,315 --> 02:38:37,283
我还记得你父亲身上恐惧的味道...

2061
02:38:37,515 --> 02:38:42,383
索恩之子索林

2062
02:38:42,513 --> 02:38:44,305
不可能
It cannot be.

2063
02:38:51,315 --> 02:38:53,483
这个是我的...

2064
02:38:54,478 --> 02:38:55,983
杀了其他的!

2065
02:39:23,278 --> 02:39:25,883
喝了他们的血!

2066
02:39:37,818 --> 02:39:39,235
树倒了!
It's going!

2067
02:40:28,827 --> 02:40:30,077
菲力!
Fili!

2068
02:40:54,686 --> 02:40:55,686
好哎!
Yeah!

2069
02:41:04,946 --> 02:41:06,113
不!
No!

2070
02:41:12,913 --> 02:41:13,579
哦 不
Oh, no.

2071
02:41:19,169 --> 02:41:20,628
甘道夫先生!
Mr. Gandalf!

2072
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:27,551
哦 别乱动 朵力!
Oh, no, Dori!

2073
02:42:38,498 --> 02:42:39,165
救命!
Help!

2074
02:42:57,893 --> 02:42:59,101
不!
No!

2075
02:43:11,782 --> 02:43:13,574
索林! 不!
Thorin! No!

2076
02:43:32,037 --> 02:43:36,486
给我砍掉他的脑袋

2077
02:44:25,037 --> 02:44:27,086
杀了他

2078
02:46:12,587 --> 02:46:13,253
等等
Look.

2079
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:03,262
索林!
Thorin!

2080
02:48:18,338 --> 02:48:19,922
索林!
Thorin!

2081
02:48:23,676 --> 02:48:24,718
索林
Thorin.

2082
02:48:42,278 --> 02:48:43,362
半身人呢?
The Halfling?

2083
02:48:44,447 --> 02:48:46,490
没事了
It's all right.

2084
02:48:46,908 --> 02:48:47,866
比尔博在这儿
Bilbo is here.

2085
02:48:48,118 --> 02:48:50,077
安然无恙
He's quite safe.

2086
02:49:00,004 --> 02:49:01,046
你!
You!

2087
02:49:05,009 --> 02:49:06,051
你那是在干什么?
What were you doing?

2088
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:07,761
你差点...
You nearly got...

2089
02:49:08,012 --> 02:49:09,179
害死你自己!
yourself killed!

2090
02:49:11,224 --> 02:49:11,974
我说过...
Did I not say...

2091
02:49:12,225 --> 02:49:14,143
你是个累赘
that you would be a burden?

2092
02:49:14,978 --> 02:49:17,437
我说你不会在荒野中生存
That you would not survive in the Wild?

2093
02:49:18,606 --> 02:49:20,524
我说你在我们中没有位置
That you had no place amongst us?

2094
02:49:26,114 --> 02:49:28,323
我这辈子都没有如此大错特错
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

2095
02:49:42,172 --> 02:49:43,714
很抱歉我怀疑过你
I am sorry I doubted you.

2096
02:49:43,965 --> 02:49:46,175
不用 要是我也会怀疑的
No, I would have doubted me too.

2097
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:48,010
我不是英雄...
I'm not a hero...

2098
02:49:48,261 --> 02:49:49,720
或者战士
or a warrior.

2099
02:49:51,681 --> 02:49:52,347
连飞贼...
Not even...

2100
02:49:52,599 --> 02:49:53,849
都算不上
a burglar.

2101
02:50:13,286 --> 02:50:15,537
前面是我们的目的地吗?
Is that what I think it is?

2102

伊鲁柏...
Erebor...

02:50:35,225 --> 02:50:37,184
中土世界矮人的...
the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms...

2105
02:50:37,435 --> 02:50:39,895
最后王国
of Middle-earth.

2106
02:50:42,607 --> 02:50:44,399
我们的家
Our home.

2107
02:50:48,863 --> 02:50:49,529
一只渡鸦!
A raven!

2108
02:50:50,448 --> 02:50:51,240
鸟儿...
The birds...

2109
02:50:51,491 --> 02:50:53,492
正在飞回山上
are returning to the mountain.

2110
02:50:56,913 --> 02:50:58,664
我亲爱的欧因...
That, my dear Oin...

2111
02:50:58,915 --> 02:51:00,666
那是一只画眉
is a thrush.

2112
02:51:01,918 --> 02:51:04,002
对我们来说 它是一种象征
But we'll take it as a sign.

2113
02:51:04,254 --> 02:51:05,254
一个好的预兆
A good omen.

2114
02:51:05,505 --> 02:51:07,005
你说的对
You're right.
