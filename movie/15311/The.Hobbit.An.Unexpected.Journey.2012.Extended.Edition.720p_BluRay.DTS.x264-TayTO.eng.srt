In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

666

He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

But if he should side with the enemy...

1612
01:44:56,872 --> 01:44:59,957
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.

1613
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:02,209
What enemy?

1614
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:05,254
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1615
01:45:05,255 --> 01:45:10,255
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

1616
01:45:12,053 --> 01:45:15,806
Does it not worry you
that the last of the Dwarf rings...

1617
01:45:15,807 --> 01:45:17,892
...should simply vanish...

1618
01:45:17,893 --> 01:45:20,144
...along with its bearer?

1619
01:45:20,145 --> 01:45:24,106
Of the seven Dwarf rings,
four were consumed by dragons...

1620
01:45:24,107 --> 01:45:27,568
...two were taken by Sauron
before he fell in Mordor.

1621
01:45:27,569 --> 01:45:32,569
The fate of the last Dwarf ring
remains unknown.

1622
01:45:34,534 --> 01:45:37,495
The ring that was worn by Thrain.

1623
01:45:37,496 --> 01:45:39,705
Without the ruling Ring of Power...

1624
01:45:39,706 --> 01:45:44,543
...the seven are of no value to the enemy.

1625

...he needs the One.

1628
01:45:50,759 --> 01:45:53,552
And that ring was lost long, long ago.

1629
01:45:53,553 --> 01:45:54,762
It was swept out...

1630
01:45:54,763 --> 01:45:57,473
...to sea by the waters of the Anduin.

1631

1632

01:46:04,564 --> 01:46:06,065
...watchful peace.

Are we? Are we at peace?

1635
01:46:10,153 --> 01:46:15,153
Trolls have come down from the mountains.
They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1636
01:46:15,325 --> 01:46:17,785
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1637
01:46:17,786 --> 01:46:19,787
Hardly a prelude to war.

1638

There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

Something far more powerful.

1643

We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1644

A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

call it Mirkwood.

...living in Dol Guldur.

1652

1653

That's absurd.

1654
01:47:05,417 --> 01:47:08,419
No such power exists in this world.

1655

This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.

1656

A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

A relic of Mordor.

A Morgul Blade.

Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

<i>Fiery mountain beneath the moon</i>

2435
02:53:41,325 --> 02:53:45,287
<i>The words unspoken</i>

2436
02:53:45,288 --> 02:53:49,457
<i>We'll be there soon</i>

2437
02:53:49,458 --> 02:53:53,461
<i>For home a song</i>

2438
02:53:53,462 --> 02:53:57,507
<i>That echoes on</i>

2439
02:53:57,508 --> 02:54:02,508
<i>And all who find us will know the tune</i>

2440
02:54:06,183 --> 02:54:10,186
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

2441
02:54:10,187 --> 02:54:14,357
<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

2442
02:54:14,358 --> 02:54:18,445
<i>Haven't seen the back of us yet</i>

2443
02:54:18,446 --> 02:54:22,449
<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

2444
02:54:22,450 --> 02:54:26,369
<i>All eyes on the hidden door</i>

2445
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:30,498
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne</i>

2446
02:54:30,499 --> 02:54:34,294
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

2447
02:54:34,295 --> 02:54:39,295
<i>Until we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

2448
02:54:41,302 --> 02:54:43,678
<i>We lay under</i>

2449
02:54:43,679 --> 02:54:48,679
<i>The misty mountains cold</i>

2450
02:54:49,018 --> 02:54:52,687
<i>In slumbers deep</i>

2451
02:54:52,688 --> 02:54:56,983
<i>And dreams of gold</i>

2452
02:54:56,984 --> 02:55:01,071
<i>We must awake</i>

2453
02:55:01,072 --> 02:55:05,075
<i>Our lives to make</i>

2454
02:55:05,076 --> 02:55:10,076
<i>And in the darkness a torch we hold</i>

2455
02:55:12,166 --> 02:55:17,166
<i>From long ago when lanterns burned</i>

2456
02:55:19,173 --> 02:55:23,218
<i>Until this day</i>

2457
02:55:23,219 --> 02:55:27,222
<i>Our hearts have yearned</i>

2458
02:55:27,223 --> 02:55:31,351
<i>Her fate unknown</i>

2459
02:55:31,352 --> 02:55:35,480
<i>The Arkenstone</i>

2460
02:55:35,481 --> 02:55:39,317
<i>What was stolen</i>

2461
02:55:39,318 --> 02:55:44,318
<i>Must be returned</i>

2462
02:55:57,503 --> 02:56:01,464
<i>We must awake</i>

2463
02:56:01,465 --> 02:56:05,510
<i>And make the day</i>

2464
02:56:05,511 --> 02:56:09,347
<i>To find a song</i>

2465
02:56:09,348 --> 02:56:14,348
<i>For heart and soul</i>

2466
02:56:15,187 --> 02:56:19,232
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

2467
02:56:19,233 --> 02:56:23,403
<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

2468
02:56:23,404 --> 02:56:27,532
<i>Haven't seen the end of it yet</i>

2469
02:56:27,533 --> 02:56:31,453
<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

2470
02:56:31,454 --> 02:56:35,498
<i>All eyes on the hidden door</i>

2471
02:56:35,499 --> 02:56:39,586
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne</i>

2472
02:56:39,587 --> 02:56:43,590
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

2473
02:56:43,591 --> 02:56:48,591
<i>Till we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

2474
02:56:50,056 --> 02:56:52,724
Far away

2475
02:56:52,725 --> 02:56:57,725
<i>From misty mountains cold</i>

2476
03:02:25,599 --> 03:02:30,599
