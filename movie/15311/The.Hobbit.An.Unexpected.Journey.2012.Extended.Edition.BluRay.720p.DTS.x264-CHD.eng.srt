1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:09,545


2
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:25,533


3
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:40,669


4
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,656


5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,608
My dear Frodo:

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,531
You asked me once...

7
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,411
if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures.

8
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,704
And while I can honestly...

9
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,997
say I have told you...

10
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,373
the truth...

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,877
I may not have told you all of it.

12
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,970
I am old now, Frodo.

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,225
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.

14
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,479
I think...

15
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,689
it is time for you to know...

16
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,860
what really happened.

17
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,822
It began...

18
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,824
long ago...

19
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,078
in a land far away to the east...

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,291
the like of which you will not find in the world today.

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,095
There was the city of Dale.

22
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,097
Its markets known...

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,390
far and wide.

24
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,893
Full of the bounties of vine and vale.

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,605
Peaceful and prosperous.

26
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,235
For this city lay before the doors...

27
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,321
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,448
Erebor.

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,701
Stronghold of Thror...

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,830
King Under the Mountain. Mightiest...

31
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,957
of the Dwarf Lords.

32
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,711
Thror ruled with utter surety...

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,338
never doubting his house would endure...

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,798
for his line lay secure...

35
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,800
in the lives of his son...

36
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,636
and grandson.

37
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,016
Ah, Frodo. Erebor.

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,476
Built deep within the mountain itself...

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,813
the beauty of this fortress city was legend.

40
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,941
Its wealth lay in the earth...

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,985
in precious gems hewn...

42
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,197
from rock and in great seams of gold...

43
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,658
running like rivers through stone.

44
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,871
The skill of the Dwarves...

45
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,874
was unequaled, fashioning objects...

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,791
of great beauty...

47
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,963
out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.

48
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,799
Ever they delved deeper...

49
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,801
down into the dark.

50
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,138
And that is where they found it.

51
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,396
The Heart of the Mountain.

52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,525
The Arkenstone.

53
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,238
Thror named it "The King's Jewel. "

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,407
He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule...

55
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,284
was divine.

56
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,702
All would pay...

57
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,995
homage to him.

58
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,247
Even the great...

59
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,916
Elven King, Thranduil.

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,006
As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew...

61
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,136
their store of good will ran thin.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,392
No one knows exactly what began the rift.

63
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,604
The Elves say...

64
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,897
the Dwarves stole their treasure.

65
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,942
The Dwarves tell another tale.

66
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:41,405
They say the Elf King refused to give them their rightful pay.

67
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,907
It is sad, Frodo, how old alliances...

68
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,075
can be broken.

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,578
How friendships between peoples can be lost.

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,248
And for what?

71
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,510
Slowly the days turned sour...

72
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,138
and the watchful nights closed in.

73
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,649
Thror's love of gold...

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,027
had grown too fierce.

75
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,948
A sickness had begun to grow within him.

76
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,910
It was a sickness of the mind.

77
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,499
And where sickness thrives...

78
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,586
bad things will follow.

79
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,847
The first they heard was a noise...

80
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,724
like a hurricane coming down...

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,933
from the North.

82
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,478
The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked...

83
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,272
in the hot, dry wind.

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,653
Balin, sound the alarm.

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,408
Call out the guard. Do it now!

86
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,077
What is it?

87
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,870
Dragon.

88
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,705
Dragon!

89
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,542
He was...

90
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,960
a firedrake from the North.

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,928
Smaug...

92
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,805
had come.

93
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,297
Such wanton death...

94
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,674
was dealt that day.

95
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,719
For this city of Men was nothing...

96
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,637
to Smaug.

97
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,764
His eye...

98
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,809
was set on another prize.

99
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,523
For dragons...

100
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,024
covet gold...

101
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,526
with a dark and...

102
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,528
fierce desire.

103
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,056
Aah!

104
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,187
No!

105
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,486
Come on.

106
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,323
Erebor was lost.

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,786
For a dragon...

108
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,830
will guard his plunder...

109
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,249
as long as he lives.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,260
Run for your lives!

111
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,138
Ah! Help us!

112
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,820
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against...

113
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,572
the wrath of the dragon.

114
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,991
No help came from the Elves...

115
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,620
that day, nor any day since.

116
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,958
Robbed of their homeland...

117
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,878
the Dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness...

118
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,382
a once mighty people brought low.

119
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,137
The young Dwarf prince took work where he could find it...

120
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,640
laboring in the villages of Men.

121
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,351
But always he remembered...

122
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,979
the mountain smoke beneath the moon...

123
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,399
the trees like torches blazing bright.

124
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,150
For he had seen dragon fire...

125
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,902
in the sky...

126
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,488
and a city turned to ash.

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,659
And he never forgave...

128
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,786
and he never forgot.

129
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,500
Far away, in another corner of the world...

130
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,459
dragons were...

131
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,460
only make-believe.

132
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,503
Up they go!

133
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,504
A party trick...

134
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,755
conjured by Wizards...

135
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,798
on Midsummer's Eve.

136
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,341
No more frightening...

137
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,634
than fairy dust.

138
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,138
Bilbo!

139
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,599
And that, my dear Frodo...

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,558
is where I come in.

141
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,477
Bilbo! Bilbo.

142
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,564
It was the beginning of an unlikely friendship...

143
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,735
that has lasted all my life.

144
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,534
But it is not the start of my story. For me, it began...

145
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,995
Well, it began as you might expect.

146
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,875
In a hole in the ground, there lived...

147
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,543
a Hobbit.

148
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,717
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole full of worms and oozy smells.

149
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,802
This was a Hobbit hole.

150
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,474
And that means good food, a warm hearth...

151
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,686
and all the comforts of home.

152
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,223
Thank you.

153
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,475
What's this?

154
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,851
That is private.

155
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,603
Keep your sticky paws off.

156
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,148
It's not ready yet.

157
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,858
Not ready for what?

158
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
Reading.

159
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,324
What on earth are these?

160
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,368
Replies to the party invitations.

161
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,164
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

162
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,749
They all say they're coming.

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,753
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses, who are demanding you ask them in person.

164
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,423
Are they, indeed? Over my...

165
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,466
- dead body.  - They'd probably find that...

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,551
quite agreeable.

167
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,928
They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.

168
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,807
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

169
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,560
And it still smells of Troll.

170
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,603
What on earth are you doing?

171
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,526
Taking precautions. You know...

172
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,154
I caught her making off with the silverware once.

173
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,782
- Who?  - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

174
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,745
She had all my spoons stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

175
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,121
Dreadful woman.

176
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,833
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I'm...

177
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,253
When I'm... When I'm...

178
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,756
When you're what?

179
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,763
It's nothing. Nothing.

180
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,479
You know, some people are beginning to wonder about you, Uncle.

181
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,356
- Huh?  - They think you're becoming odd.

182
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,026
Odd? Oh. Hm.

183
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,527
Unsociable.

184
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,614
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

185
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,073
Be a good lad and put that...

186
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,283
on the gate.

187
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:13,999


188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,127
Do you think he'll come?

189
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,462
Who?

190
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,963
Gandalf.

191
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,176
Oh... ho. He wouldn't miss a chance to let off his Whizpoppers. He'll give us...

192
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,844
quite a show, you'll see.

193
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,180
- Right, then. I'm off.  - Off to where?

194
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,516
East-farthing Woods. I'm going to surprise him.

195
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:34,020
Well, go on, then. You don't want to be late.

196
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,070
He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no. Not that I...

197
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,696
ever was.

198
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,866
In those days, I was always on time.

199
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,203
I was entirely respectable.

200
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,082
And nothing unexpected...

201
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,086
ever happened.

202
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,999


203
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:19,999


204
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,153
- Good morning.  - What do you mean?

205
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,241
Do you wish me a good morning or do you mean that it is a good morning...

206
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,701
whether I want it or not?

207
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,914
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning?

208
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,586
Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

209
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,964
All of them at once, I suppose.

210
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,717
Hmm.

211
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,805
Can I help you?

212
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,725
That remains to be seen.

213
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:59,188
I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

214
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,902
An adventure?

215
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,992
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree would have much interest in adventures.

216
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,580
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

217
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,791
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

218
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,792
Mm.

219
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,586
Huh.

220
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,755
Hmm.

221
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,841
Oh. Ah.

222
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,176
Good morning.

223
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,262
To think that I should have lived to be "good morninged"...

224
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,434
by Belladonna Took's son as if I were selling buttons at the door.

225
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,102
Beg your pardon?

226
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,521
You've changed, and not entirely for the better...

227
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,898
Bilbo Baggins.

228
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,316
I'm sorry, do I know you?

229
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,653
Well, you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.

230
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,321
I'm Gandalf.

231
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,615
And Gandalf means...

232
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,243
me.

233
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,496
Gandalf? Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

234
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,997
who made such excellent...

235
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,710
- fireworks? Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve.  - Heh, heh. Ahem.

236
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,963
No idea you were still in business.

237
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,548
And where else should I be?

238
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,551
Where else...? Ahem.

239
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,140
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember something about me...

240
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,060
even if it's only my fireworks.

241
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,480
Yes. Well, that's decided.

242
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,482
It'll be very good for you...

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,694
and most amusing for me.

244
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,529
I shall inform the others.

245
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,991
Inform the who? What? No. No. No... Wait.

246
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,367
We do not want...

247
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,746
any adventures here, thank you. Not today. Not...

248
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,667
I suggest you try Over the Hill or Across the Water.

249
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,463
Good morning.

250
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,222
Morning!

251
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,613
Twelve. There we go. Have a very good day.

252
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,177
Chum.

253
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,765
Hello, Mr. Bilbo. Here.

254
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,560
Have a feel of me tubers. Nice and firm, they are.

255
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,355
- Just come in from West Farthing.  - Very impressive, Mr. Worrywort.

256
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,317
Now, I don't suppose you've seen a Wizard lurking around these parts?

257
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,318
A tall fellow.

258
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,903
Long, gray beard.

259
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,071
Pointy hat.

260
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,241
Can't say I have.

261
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,709
Dwalin, at your service.

262
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,712
Hm. Uh...

263
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,841
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

264
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,092
Do we...

265
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,093
know each other?

266
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,345
No.

267
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,097
Which way, laddie?

268
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,308
Is it down here?

269
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,392
Is what...

270
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,852
down where?

271
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,103
Supper.

272
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,440
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

273
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,818
He... He said? Who said?

274
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,488
Mmm.

275
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,328
Mmm.

276
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,457
Very good, this. Any more?

277
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,126
What? Oh, yes, yes.

278
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,711
Ah.

279
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,010
Help yourself.

280
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:29,143
Hmm. It's just that, um, I wasn't expecting company.

281
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,607
That'll be the door.

282
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,445
Balin...

283
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,656
at your service.

284
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,366
Good evening.

285
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,493
Yes. Yes, it is.

286
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,454
- Though I think it might rain later.  - Hm?

287
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,872
Am I late?

288
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,250
Late for what?

289
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,542
Oh!

290
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,419
Ha, ha!

291
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,338
Evening, brother.

292
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,800
By my beard...

293
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,970
you're shorter and wider than last we met.

294
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,846
Wider, not shorter.

295
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,766
Sharp enough for both of us.

296
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,736
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

297
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,032
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure you're in the right house.

298
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,243
- Have you eaten?  - It's not that I don't like visitors...

299
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,078
I like visitors...

300
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,372
as much as the next Hobbit.

301
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,126
But I do like to know them before they come visiting.

302
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,627
- What is this?  - I don't know.

303
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,755
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.  - It's riddled with mold.

304
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:45,344
The thing is, I don't know either of you. Not in the slightest. I don't mean...

305
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,596
to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind.

306
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:48,848
- I'm sorry.  - You think...?

307
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,978
Apology accepted.

308
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,646
- Ah.  - Now, fill it up, brother...

309
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,564
don't stint.

310
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,151
- You wanna get stuck in?  - I could eat again if you insist, brother.

311
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,989
- Fili.  - And Kili.

312
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,991
At your service.

313
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,576
You must be Mr. Boggins.

314
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,911
Nope! You can't come in. You've come to the wrong house.

315
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,038
What?

316
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,498
- Has it been canceled?  - No one told us.

317
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,417
No, nothing's been canceled.

318
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,501
That's a relief.

319
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,840
Careful with these.

320
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,509
I just had them sharpened.

321
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,428
- It's nice, this place.  - Yeah.

322
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,890
- Did you do it yourself?  - What? No, it's been in the family for years.

323
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,934
That's my mother's glory box. Can you please not do that?

324
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,729
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

325
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,315
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

326
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,069
Shove this in the hallway. Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

327
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,113
"Everyone"? How many more are there? Where do you want this?

328
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,199
- Oh, no.  - It's really heavy.

329
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,993
No. No. There's nobody home!

330
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,913
Go away and bother somebody else.

331
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,291
There's far too many Dwarves in my dining room as it is.

332
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,420
If this is some clot-head's idea of a joke...

333
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,090
I can only say it is in very...

334
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,132
poor taste.

335
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,135
Get off...

336
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,512
you big lump!

337
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,435
Gandalf.

338
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,775
Excuse me, that's my chicken. Um...

339
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,778
If... If you don't... That's my wine. Excuse me!

340
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,159
He's got an injury.

341
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,036
You mean the ax in his head?

342
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,123
Dead? No, only between his ears.

343
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,500
His legs work fine.

344
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,003
Put those back.

345
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,088
Put that back.

346
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,339
Put that back.

347
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,298
Not the jam.

348
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,466
Excuse me. Excuse me.

349
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,553
It's a tad excessive, isn't it? Have you got a cheese knife?

350
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,597
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.  - Ugh.

351
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,184
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair... No, so is that. Take it back, please.

352
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,272
- I cannot hear what you're saying.  - It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

353
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:06,819
That is a book, not a coaster. And put that map down.

354
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,321
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?  - Yes?

355
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,158
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

356
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:17,121
Oh, no, thank you, Dori. A little red wine for me, I think.

357
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,793
Whoop! Mind out.

358
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,381
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

359
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,675
Oin, Gloin.

360
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,845
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

361
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,723
- Dori, Nori. Ori!  - No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

362
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,475
No, thank you.

363
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,105
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

364
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,566
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

365
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:51,197
He is late, is all. He traveled north to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

366
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,117
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine, as requested.

367
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,328
It's got a fruity bouquet.

368
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,830
Oh. Cheers.

369
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,876
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

370
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,465
No chance. Not from that distance.

371
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,592
Wanna bet? Bombur...

372
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,510
catch!

373
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,014
I'll help you with that.

374
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,564
Oh, you great...

375
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,857
galumphing git!

376
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,150
Who wants an ale? There you go.

377
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,068
Over here, brother.

378
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
I said have another drink...

379
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,531
Here you go.

380
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,995
Ale on the count of three!

381
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:40,913
One...

382
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,790
- two...  - Up!

383
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,469
I knew you had it in you!

384
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,264
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth.

385
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,557
But it's full of holes.

386
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,976
It's supposed to look like that. It's crochet.

387
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,145
And a wonderful game it is too, if you've got the balls for it.

388
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,231
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

389
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,150
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

390
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,153
What's the matter? I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

391
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,905
What are they doing here?

392
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,826
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering once you get used to them.

393
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,953
I don't want to get used to them.

394
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,290
Look at the state of my kitchen. There's mud trod into the carpet.

395
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,874
They've pillaged the pantry.

396
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,460
I won't tell you what they've done in the bathroom.

397
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,506
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't understand what they're doing in my house!

398
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,886
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but what should I do with my plate?

399
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,347
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

400
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:45,769
Take that back.

401
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,687
Excuse me.

402
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,188
That's my mother's...

403
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,940
West Farthing pottery. It's over...

404
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,358
100 years old!

405
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,487
And can you...

406
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,488
not do that?

407
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,406
You'll blunt them.

408
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,533
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

409
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:00,993
He says...

410
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,911
we'll blunt the knives.

411
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,997
# Blunt the knives, bend the forks #

412
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,666
# Smash the bottles and burn the corks #

413
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,668
# Chip the glasses and crack the plates #

414
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,130
# That's what Bilbo Baggin hates#

415
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,757
# Cut the cloth, tread on the fat #

416
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,800
# Leave the bones on the bedroom mat #

417
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,510
# Pour the milk on the pantry floor #

418
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,805
# Splash the wine #

419
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:22,723
# on every door #

420
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,516
# Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl #

421
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,310
# Pound them up with a thumping pole #

422
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,227
# When you're finished #

423
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,520
# If they are whole #

424
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,192
# Send them down the hall to roll #

425
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,577
# That's what Bilbo Baggins hates #

426
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,624
Bilbo.

427
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,301
He is here.

428
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,890
Gandalf.

429
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,101
I thought you said...

430
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,394
this place would be easy to find...

431
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,146
I lost my way, twice.

432
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,817
I wouldn't have found it at all had it not been for that mark on the door.

433
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,945
Mark? There's no mark on that door. It was painted a week ago.

434
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,198
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

435
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:26,120
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce the leader of our company:

436
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,622
Thorin Oakenshield.

437
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,374
So...

438
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,627
this is the Hobbit.

439
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,964
Tell me, Mr. Baggins, have you done much fighting?

440
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,716
- Pardon me? Ax or sword?

441
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,801
What's your weapon of choice?

442
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,471
Well, I do have some skill at conkers, if you must know...

443
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,267
but I fail to see why that's relevant.

444
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,227
Thought as much.

445
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,230
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

446
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,153
What news...

447
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,156
from the meeting in Ered Luin? Did they all come?

448
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,409
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.  - All of them!

449
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,203
And what did the Dwarves of the Iron Hills say?

450
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,290
Is Dain with us?

451
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,085
They will not come.

452
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,214
They say this quest...

453
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,634
is ours and ours alone.

454
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,347
You're going on a quest?

455
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:32,853
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have a little more light.

456
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,606
Far to the east...

457
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,984
over ranges and rivers...

458
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,529
beyond woodlands and wastelands...

459
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,073
lies a single, solitary peak.

460
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,412
"The Lonely Mountain."

461
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,123
Aye, Oin has read...

462
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:57,711
the portents, and the portents say it is time.

463
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,046
Ravens have been seen...

464
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,841
flying back to the mountain, as it was foretold.

465
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,636
"When the birds of yore return...

466
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,970
to Erebor...

467
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,722
the reign of the beast...

468
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,641
will end. "

469
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,729
- Uh, what beast?  - That would be a reference...

470
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,397
to Smaug the Terrible...

471
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,899
chiefest and greatest...

472
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,275
calamity of our age.

473
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,987
Airborne fire-breather.

474
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,239
Teeth like razors...

475
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,949
claws like meat hooks.

476
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,492
Fond of precious metals.

477
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,618
I know what a dragon is.

478
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,912
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

479
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,915
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron right up his jacksie!

480
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,833
Good lad, Ori!

481
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:36,750
Sit down.

482
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,168
The task would be difficult...

483
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,795
with an army behind us...

484
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,130
but we number just 13.

485
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,258
And not 13 of the best...

486
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,176
nor brightest.

487
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,303
Hey, who are you calling dim?

488
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,305
Sorry, what did he say?

489
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,432
We may be few in number...

490
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,228
but we're fighters, all of us...

491
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,479
to the last Dwarf.

492
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,898
And you forget, we have a Wizard in our company.

493
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,942
Gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons.

494
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,653
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

495
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,822
- How many, then?  - What?

496
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,323
How many dragons have you killed?

497
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,286
Go on.

498
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,787
Give us a number.

499
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,457
Excuse me. Please.

500
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,797
If we have read these signs...

501
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,675
do you not think others will have read them too?

502
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,555
Rumors have begun to spread.

503
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,641
The dragon, Smaug, has not been seen for 60 years.

504
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,562
Eyes look east to the mountain, assessing...

505
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,733
wondering, weighing the risk.

506
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,527
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected.

507
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,615
Do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours?

508
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,034
Or do we seize this chance...

509
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,201
to take back Erebor?

510
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,290
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

511
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,583
There is no way...

512
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,710
into the mountain.

513
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,213
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

514
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,677
How came you by this?

515
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
It was given to me...

516
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,056
by your father.

517
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,807
By Thrain.

518
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,559
For safekeeping.

519
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,102
It is yours...

520
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,437
now.

521
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,279
If there is a key...

522
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,865
there must be a door.

523
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,158
These runes...

524
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,954
speak of a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.

525
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,289
There's another way in.

526
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,293
Well, if we can find it, but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

527
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,465
The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map...

528
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,676
and I do not have the skill to find it.

529
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,096
But there are others in Middle-earth who can.

530
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,351
The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth...

531
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,645
and no small amount of courage.

532
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:07,567
But if we are careful and clever, I believe that it can be done.

533
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,319
That's why we need a burglar.

534
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,115
Hmm. And a good one too. An expert, I'd imagine.

535
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,617
And are you?

536
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,454
Am I what?

537
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,416
He said he's an expert.

538
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,754
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar. I've never stolen a thing in my life.

539
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,632
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr. Baggins.

540
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,843
He's hardly burglar material.

541
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,052
Nope.

542
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,515
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

543
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,600
He's just fine.

544
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,357
Enough!

545
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,151
If I say Bilbo Baggins...

546
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,861
is a burglar, then a burglar...

547
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,529
he is.

548
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,323
Hobbits are light on their feet...

549
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,703
In fact, they can pass unseen by most, if they choose.

550
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,498
And, while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of Dwarf...

551
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,205
the scent of a Hobbit is all but unknown to him...

552
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:10,538
which gives us a distinct advantage.

553
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,626
You asked me to find the 14th member of this

554
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,126
company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

555
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:18,383
There's a lot more to him than appearances suggest.

556
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:21,385
And he's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know.

557
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:24,306
Including himself.

558
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,556
You must trust me on this.

559
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,897
Very well.

560
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:38,816
- We will do it your way.  - No, no.

561
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,443
- Give him the contract.  - We're in. We're off.

562
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,653
It's just the usual.

563
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,818
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...

564
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:46,578
time required, remuneration...

565
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,618
funeral arrangements, so forth.

566
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:50,991
Funeral arrangements?

567
00:34:56,788 --> 00:34:58,290
I cannot guarantee his safety.

568
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,251
Understood.

569
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:03,258
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

570
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,470
Agreed.

571
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:08,939
"Terms: Cash on

572
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,184
delivery, up to but not exceeding one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

573
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,265
Hmm. Seems fair.

574
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:19,153
"Present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by...

575
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:24,568
or sustained as a consequence thereof, including, but not limited to lacerations...

576
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,657
evisceration..."

577
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:31,323
Incineration?

578
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:34,459
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye.

579
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:42,630
- You all right, laddie?  - Huh? Yeah.

580
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:45,720
Feel a bit faint.

581
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:48,055
- Think furnace with wings.  - Air.

582
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,716
I need air.

583
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:52,477
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.

584
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:54,637
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

585
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,020
Nope.

586
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,106
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

587
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,034
I'll be all right. Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

588
00:36:08,193 --> 00:36:11,538
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

589
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:15,993
Tell me, when did doilies and your mother's dishes...

590
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,828
become so important to you?

591
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,471
I remember a young Hobbit who was always

592
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:23,171
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

593
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,549
Who would stay out late, come home after dark...

594
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:30,341
trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

595
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:32,885
A young Hobbit who would have liked nothing better...

596
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:36,518
than to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire.

597
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,935
The world is not in your books and maps.

598
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:44,150
It's out there.

599
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:48,108
I can't just go running off into the blue.

600
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,448
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

601
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:53,742
You are also a Took.

602
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:59,077
Did you know that your great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...

603
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:01,872
was so large, he could ride a real horse?

604
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,208
- Yes.  - Yes, well, he could.

605
00:37:04,374 --> 00:37:07,253
In the Battle of Green Fields, he charged the Goblin ranks.

606
00:37:07,419 --> 00:37:11,265
He swung his club so hard, it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

607
00:37:11,423 --> 00:37:15,599
and it sailed 100 yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole.

608
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:17,517
And thus, the battle was won.

609
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:21,308
And the game of golf invented at the same time.

610
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:26,655
I do believe you made that up.

611
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:30,568
Well, all good stories deserve embellishment.

612
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,081
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.

613
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:42,045
Can you promise that I will come back?

614
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:45,499
No.

615
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:47,755
And if you do...

616
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:50,883
you will not be the same.

617
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:54,216
That's what I thought.

618
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:58,432
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

619
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:02,224
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

620
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:12,276
It appears we have lost our burglar.

621
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:15,320
Probably for the best.

622
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,865
The odds were always against us.

623
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:21,035
After all, what are we?

624
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:24,378
Merchants, miners...

625
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:27,169
tinkers, toy-makers.

626
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:30,302
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

627
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:33,637
There are a few warriors amongst us.

628
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:36,174
Old warriors.

629
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:38,719
I would take each and every one of these Dwarves...

630
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:41,016
over an army from the Iron Hills.

631
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:44,145
For when I called upon them, they answered.

632
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:47,485
Loyalty, honor...

633
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,692
a willing heart.

634
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,908
I can ask no more than that.

635
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,657
You don't have to do this.

636
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,697
You have a choice.

637
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:01,867
You've done honorably by our people.

638
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,500
You have built a new life for us in the Blue Mountains.

639
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,833
A life of peace and plenty.

640
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:15,639
A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor.

641
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:21,099
From my grandfather to my father, this has come to me.

642
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,600
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

643
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,903
There is no choice, Balin.

644
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:33,902
Not for me.

645
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:37,949
Then we are with you, laddie.

646
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:42,248
We will see it done.

647
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:11,859
# Far over the misty mountains cold #

648
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,401
# To dungeons deep #

649
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:21,780
# And caverns old #

650
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:26,577
# We must away #

651
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,256
# 'Ere break of day #

652
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:39,497
# To find our long-forgotten gold #

653
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:48,840
# The pines were roaring on the height #

654
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:57,891
# The winds were moaning in the night #

655
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:06,858
# The fire was red, it flaming spread #

656
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:15,676
# The trees like torches blazed with light #

657
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,758
Hello?

658
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,057
Yes.

659
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:12,064
Yes.

660
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:25,967
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

661
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,883
- Can't stop, I'm already late!  - Late for what?

662
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:32,145
I'm going on an adventure!

663
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:41,108
I said it. Didn't I say it? Coming here was a waste of time.

664
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,817
That's true enough.

665
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,946
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit? A Halfling?

666
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:48,694
Wait!

667
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:50,659
Wait!

668
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:03,467
I signed it.

669
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:06,466
Here.

670
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:18,308
Everything appears to be in order.

671
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:20,852
Welcome, Master Baggins...

672
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,069
to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

673
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:31,616
Give him a pony.

674
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:33,664
No, no, that won't be necessary.

675
00:44:33,823 --> 00:44:36,042
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

676
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,749
I've done my fair share of walking holidays, you know?

677
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:41,001
Even got as far as Frogmorton once.

678
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,763
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

679
00:44:58,764 --> 00:45:00,858
- One more.  - Thanks, lad.

680
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:02,610
What's that about?

681
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:07,324
Oh, they took wagers on whether or not you'd turn up.

682
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:10,325
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

683
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:13,287
And what did you think?

684
00:45:18,075 --> 00:45:22,672
My dear fellow, I never doubted you for a second.

685
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:31,468
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

686
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,717
No, wait, wait, stop.

687
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,437
Stop! We have to turn around.

688
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,764
What on earth is the matter?

689
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:42,108
- I forgot my handkerchief.  - Here.

690
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:44,769
Use this.

691
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:50,699
Move on.

692
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,664
You'll have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs...

693
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:03,212
and a good many other things, Bilbo Baggins...

694
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:06,754
before we reach our journey's end.

695
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:12,764
You were born to the rolling hills and little rivers of the Shire.

696
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:16,677
But home is now behind you.

697
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,971
The world is ahead.

698
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:04,057
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

699
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,524
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

700
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:11,655
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

701
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:17,449
What was that?

702
00:47:18,821 --> 00:47:19,868
Orcs.

703
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:21,574
Orcs?

704
00:47:23,284 --> 00:47:26,208
Throat-cutters. There'll be dozens of them out there.

705
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:28,502
The lone-lands are crawling with them.

706
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:31,543
They strike in the wee small hours when everyone's asleep.

707
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:34,883
Quick and quiet, no screams. Just lots of blood.

708
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:41,098
You think that's funny?

709
00:47:43,054 --> 00:47:45,432
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

710
00:47:46,223 --> 00:47:47,645
We didn't mean anything by it.

711
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:50,607
No, you didn't.

712
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:53,234
You know nothing of the world.

713
00:47:54,857 --> 00:47:57,110
Don't mind him, laddie.

714
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:01,998
Thorin has more cause than most to hate Orcs.

715
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:09,876
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

716
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:15,884
King Thror tried to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

717
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:21,100
But our enemy had got there first.

718
00:48:33,395 --> 00:48:37,445
Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...

719
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:42,330
led by the most vile of all their race:

720
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,909
Azog the Defiler.

721
00:48:48,202 --> 00:48:50,921
The giant Gundabad Orc...

722
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:56,344
had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

723
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:02,300
He began...

724
00:49:03,384 --> 00:49:05,261
by beheading the king.

725
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:19,491
No!

726
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:25,540
Thrain, Thorin's father, was driven mad by grief.

727
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:28,326
He went missing. Taken prisoner or killed...

728
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:31,087
We did not know.

729
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:33,422
We were leaderless.

730
00:49:34,165 --> 00:49:37,715
Defeat and death...

731
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:39,720
were upon us.

732
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:46,519
That is when I saw him.

733
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:50,480
A young Dwarf prince...

734
00:49:51,473 --> 00:49:55,068
facing down the pale Orc.

735
00:49:59,315 --> 00:50:02,910
He stood alone against this terrible foe.

736
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,254
His armor rent...

737
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:17,925
wielding nothing but an oaken branch as a shield.

738
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:35,644
Azog the Defiler learned that day...

739
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:40,569
that the line of Durin would not be so easily broken.

740
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:46,469


741
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:52,069


742
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,052
Our forces rallied...

743
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:13,772
and drove the Orcs back.

744
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:16,938
And our enemy...

745
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:19,736
had been defeated.

746
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,574
But there was no feast...

747
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:27,028
nor song that night...

748
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:31,995
for our dead were beyond the count of grief.

749
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:36,420
We few had survived.

750
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:46,509
And I thought to myself then...

751
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:53,604
there is one who I could follow.

752
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,858
There is one...

753
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:00,610
I could call king.

754
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,877
And the pale Orc?

755
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:24,760
What happened to him?

756
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:28,468
He slunk back into the hole whence he came.

757
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:32,517
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

758
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:58,517


759
00:52:59,522 --> 00:53:02,947


760
00:53:18,597 --> 00:53:22,227
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something about this deluge?

761
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,274
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

762
00:53:25,437 --> 00:53:29,158
and it will continue to rain until the rain is done.

763
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:33,783
If you wish to change the weather of the world, you should find yourself another Wizard.

764
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:36,744
- Are there any?  - What?

765
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:39,535
- Other Wizards.  - There are five of us.

766
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:44,207
The greatest of our order is Saruman the White.

767
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:46,884
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

768
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,588
Do you know, I've quite forgotten their names.

769
00:53:51,755 --> 00:53:52,972
And who is the fifth?

770
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:57,144
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

771
00:53:57,302 --> 00:54:01,057
Is he a great Wizard? Or is he more like you?

772
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:07,818
I think he's a very great Wizard, in his own way.

773
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:12,614
He's a gentle soul who prefers the company of animals to others.

774
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:15,825
He keeps a watchful eye over the vast forest lands...

775
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:18,578
to the east. And a good thing too.

776
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:23,792
For always evil will look to find a foothold in this world.

777
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:33,468
Not good. Not good at all.

778
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:42,189
Eww.

779
00:54:57,613 --> 00:54:59,957
Oh, no. Sebastian.

780
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,707
Good gracious.

781
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,646
Come on.

782
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:29,903
Move back! Give him some air, for goodness sake.

783
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:41,494
There. There.

784
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:45,498
I don't understand why it's not working.

785
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:48,130
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

786
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:53,422
Witchcraft.

787
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:58,599
Oh, but it is.

788
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:05,186
A dark and powerful magic.

789
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:49,586
Lerya laman naiquentallo.

790
00:56:50,008 --> 00:56:53,186
Si a hlare omaquettar.

791
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,786
Na coilerya en-vinyanta.

792
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:02,386
Si a hlare omaquettar.

793
00:57:03,008 --> 00:57:10,686
Na coilerya en-vinyanta.

794
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,531
Where on this good earth did those foul creatures come from?

795
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:45,452
The old fortress?

796
00:57:46,073 --> 00:57:47,245
Show me.

797
00:58:20,816 --> 00:58:22,568
We'll camp here for the night.

798
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:27,448
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies. Make sure you stay with them.

799
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:31,748
A farmer and his family used to live here.

800
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,709
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.  - Aye.

801
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:35,918
Right you are.

802
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:39,711
I think it would be wiser to move on.

803
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:43,590
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

804
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,757
I have told you already...

805
00:58:45,924 --> 00:58:47,801
I will not go near that place.

806
00:58:47,968 --> 00:58:50,266
Why not? The Elves could help us.

807
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,523
We could get food, rest, advice.

808
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:54,771
I do not need their advice.

809
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:59,025
We have a map that we cannot read. Lord Elrond could help us.

810
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,564
Help?

811
00:59:01,565 --> 00:59:03,693
A dragon attacks Erebor.

812
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:06,112
What help came from the Elves?

813
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:09,118
Orcs plunder Moria...

814
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,704
desecrate our sacred halls.

815
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:14,746
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

816
00:59:15,746 --> 00:59:19,796
And you ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather.

817
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,255
Who betrayed my father.

818
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:23,216
You are neither of them.

819
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:27,591
I did not give you that map and key for you to hold onto the past.

820
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:29,806
I did not know that they were yours to keep.

821
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:38,735
Everything all right? Gandalf, where are you going?

822
00:59:38,894 --> 00:59:42,319
To seek the company of the only one around here who's got any sense.

823
00:59:42,481 --> 00:59:45,155
- And who's that?  - Myself, Mr. Baggins.

824
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:48,112
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

825
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:51,994
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

826
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:54,785
Is he coming back?

827
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,499
He's been a long time.

828
01:00:00,707 --> 01:00:02,004
- Who?  - Gandalf.

829
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,298
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

830
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:07,552
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

831
01:00:08,131 --> 01:00:09,678
Stop it. You've had plenty.

832
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:13,471
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur. I've had worse.

833
01:00:13,637 --> 01:00:15,685
- Dori could've cooked it.  - Ha-ha-ha.

834
01:00:15,806 --> 01:00:18,104
Hilarious.

835
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:30,116
What's the matter?

836
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,700
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.  - Only we've encountered a slight problem.

837
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:36,709
We had 16.

838
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,709
Now there's 14.

839
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:45,343
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

840
01:00:45,544 --> 01:00:47,342
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

841
01:00:47,504 --> 01:00:50,132
And that is not good at all. Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

842
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:53,222
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

843
01:00:53,385 --> 01:00:56,639
As our official burglar, we thought you might like to look into it.

844
01:00:56,805 --> 01:00:58,182
Well, uh...

845
01:00:58,723 --> 01:01:02,853
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.  - That was our thinking.

846
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:07,532
It's something very big and possibly quite dangerous.

847
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,447
Hey.

848
01:01:10,026 --> 01:01:11,528
There's a light.

849
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:13,617
Over here.

850
01:01:16,157 --> 01:01:17,158
Stay down.

851
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:24,044
What is it?

852
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:25,629
Trolls.

853
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:44,936
Oh.

854
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:54,537
He's got Myrtle and Minty.

855
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:58,367
I think they're gonna eat them. We have to do something.

856
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:00,373
Yes, you should.

857
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,631
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid, and you're so small, they'll never see you.

858
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:06,799
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

859
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:10,588
If you run into trouble, hoot twice like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.

860
01:02:10,754 --> 01:02:13,724
Twice like a barn owl. No, twice like a brown... Once like a...

861
01:02:13,924 --> 01:02:15,847
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?

862
01:02:16,217 --> 01:02:19,266
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

863
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:22,899
and, blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow.

864
01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:25,977
Quit your griping.

865
01:02:26,186 --> 01:02:30,441
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

866
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:35,955
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have. Not enough fat on them.

867
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:38,456
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.

868
01:02:38,615 --> 01:02:42,995
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still picking bits of him out of me teeth.

869
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:47,458
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

870
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:49,589
Might improve the flavor.

871
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:52,300
Ah. There's more where that came from.

872
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:53,801
- Oh, no, you don't!  - Ow!

873
01:02:57,759 --> 01:02:59,636
Sit down!

874
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:11,990
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

875
01:03:12,148 --> 01:03:14,867
I don't like the stinky parts.

876
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,995
- Ow!  - I said sit down.

877
01:03:18,154 --> 01:03:19,201
I'm starving!

878
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:22,459
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

879
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:26,667
Shut your cakehole. You'll eat what I give you.

880
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:31,214
How come he's the cook? Everything tastes the same.

881
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:33,003
Everything tastes like chicken.

882
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:34,341
Except the chicken.

883
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:35,889
What tastes like fish!

884
01:03:36,006 --> 01:03:39,351
I'm just saying, a little appreciation would be nice.

885
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,475
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert. Lovely stew, Bert."

886
01:03:45,682 --> 01:03:49,607
- How hard is that?  - Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

887
01:03:50,061 --> 01:03:52,860
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

888
01:03:53,982 --> 01:03:55,905
Here, that's my grog.

889
01:03:58,528 --> 01:04:01,532
Sorry. Ow!

890
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:07,663
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

891
01:04:08,288 --> 01:04:11,212
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

892
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:13,209
Good, isn't it?

893
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,719
That's why I'm the cook.

894
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:29,693
Oh, my guts are grumbling. I got to snaffle something.

895
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:32,604
- Flesh, I need flesh.  - Ah! Ah!

896
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:37,108
Blimey!

897
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:40,780
Bert. Bert! Look what's come out of me hooter.

898
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:43,073
It's got arms and legs and everything.

899
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:44,874
What is it?

900
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:47,707
I don't know. But I don't like the way it wriggles around.

901
01:04:51,706 --> 01:04:54,926
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

902
01:04:55,085 --> 01:04:56,803
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

903
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:59,055
A burglar Hobbit?

904
01:04:59,214 --> 01:05:00,841
Can we cook him?

905
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,559
We can try.

906
01:05:06,346 --> 01:05:08,440
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

907
01:05:08,598 --> 01:05:11,397
Not when he's skinned and boned.

908
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:14,571
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits around these parts.

909
01:05:14,729 --> 01:05:17,733
Might be enough for a pie.

910
01:05:18,024 --> 01:05:19,992
- Grab him!  - He's too quick.

911
01:05:20,193 --> 01:05:23,493
Right. Come here, you little...

912
01:05:23,655 --> 01:05:24,872
Gotcha.

913
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:28,831
Are there any more of you little fellas hiding where you shouldn't?

914
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:30,628
No.

915
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:32,164
He's lying.

916
01:05:32,372 --> 01:05:36,718
- No, I'm not!  - Hold his toes over the fire.

917
01:05:36,918 --> 01:05:39,592
Make him squeal!

918
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:44,099
Drop him!

919
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:45,681
You what?

920
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:47,937
I said...

921
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:49,268
drop him.

922
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:15,958
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!

923
01:06:38,188 --> 01:06:39,656
Ow!

924
01:07:05,256 --> 01:07:07,429
Come on! Get up!

925
01:07:07,717 --> 01:07:09,014
- Bilbo!  - Don't!

926
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:12,639
Lay down your arms...

927
01:07:13,306 --> 01:07:15,104
or we'll rip his off.

928
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:31,741
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

929
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:33,535
Don't bother cooking them.

930
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:37,956
Let's just sit on them and squash them into jelly.

931
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:42,298
They should be sauteed and grilled with a sprinkle of sage.

932
01:07:42,502 --> 01:07:44,004
Is this really necessary?

933
01:07:44,212 --> 01:07:45,964
That does sound quite nice.

934
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,599
- Untie me, mister.  - Eat someone your own size.

935
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,223
Never mind the seasoning.

936
01:07:51,386 --> 01:07:53,138
We ain't got all night.

937
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:56,691
Dawn ain't far away. Let's get a move on.

938
01:07:56,808 --> 01:07:59,277
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

939
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,323
Wait!

940
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:06,485
You are making a terrible mistake.

941
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:08,904
You can't reason with them. They're half-wits!

942
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:11,164
Half-wits? What does that make us?

943
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:14,580
I meant with the seasoning.

944
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:17,503
What about the seasoning?

945
01:08:17,704 --> 01:08:18,956
Well, have you smelt them?

946
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:22,839
You're gonna need something stronger than sage before you plate this lot up.

947
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:26,096
- Traitor!  - What do you know about cooking Dwarf?

948
01:08:26,671 --> 01:08:27,718
Shut up.

949
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,722
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

950
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:35,559
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

951
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:38,817
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.  - It's, uh...

952
01:08:39,017 --> 01:08:41,065
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

953
01:08:43,604 --> 01:08:45,356
to skin them first.

954
01:08:45,523 --> 01:08:47,491
What? Skin us?

955
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:50,157
Tom, get me filleting knife.

956
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,993
I'll skin you, you little...!

957
01:08:52,155 --> 01:08:54,032
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

958
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,496
What a load of rubbish.

959
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:59,625
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

960
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,165
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.

961
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:05,088
He's right.

962
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:07,883
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

963
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:12,804
Nice and crunchy.

964
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:15,683
Oh, not that one. He's infected.

965
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,597
- Huh?  - You what?

966
01:09:17,764 --> 01:09:21,860
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

967
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,028
- Eww!  - Aah!

968
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,524
In fact, they all have. They're infested with parasites.

969
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:30,694
It's a terrible business. I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.

970
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,737
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?

971
01:09:32,904 --> 01:09:35,703
We don't have parasites. You have parasites!

972
01:09:36,407 --> 01:09:38,375
What are you talking about, laddie?

973
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:43,790
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

974
01:09:43,956 --> 01:09:46,550
Mine are the biggest parasites. I've got huge parasites.

975
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:50,054
- We're riddled.  - Yes, I'm riddled.

976
01:09:50,213 --> 01:09:51,510
Yes, we are, badly.

977
01:09:51,672 --> 01:09:54,551
What would you have us do, then?

978
01:09:54,717 --> 01:09:56,219
Let them all go?

979
01:09:56,677 --> 01:09:59,931
- Well...  - You think I don't know what you're up to?

980
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,486
This little ferret is taking us for fools.

981
01:10:04,936 --> 01:10:06,483
- Ferret?  - Fools?

982
01:10:06,646 --> 01:10:09,570
The dawn will take you all.

983
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:12,618
- Who's that?  - No idea.

984
01:10:12,777 --> 01:10:13,949
Can we eat him too?

985
01:10:40,096 --> 01:10:42,645
Get your foot out of my back.

986
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:49,901
Ah.

987
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,323
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

988
01:10:54,444 --> 01:10:56,162
To look ahead.

989
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:59,331
- What brought you back?  - Looking behind.

990
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:01,576
Nasty business.

991
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:03,244
Still, they're all in one piece.

992
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:04,913
No thanks to your burglar.

993
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,458
He had the nous to play for time.

994
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:12,254
None of the rest of you thought of that.

995
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:17,262
They must have come down from the Ettenmoors.

996
01:11:17,425 --> 01:11:20,178
Since when do Mountain Trolls venture this far south?

997
01:11:20,386 --> 01:11:22,480
Ooh. Not for an age.

998
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:26,643
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

999
01:11:32,523 --> 01:11:36,118
They could not have moved in daylight.

1000
01:11:36,652 --> 01:11:39,030
There must be a cave nearby.

1001
01:11:49,665 --> 01:11:51,963
Oh, what's that stench?

1002
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:55,300
It's a Troll-hoard.

1003
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:58,220
Be careful what you touch.

1004
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:13,781
Seems a shame just to leave it lying around.

1005
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:17,819
- Anyone could take it.  - Agreed.

1006
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:19,658
- Nori.  - Yeah?

1007
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,197
Get a shovel.

1008
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,512
These swords were not made by any Troll.

1009
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:50,735
Nor were they made by any smith among men.

1010
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:57,529
These were forged in Gondolin...

1011
01:12:57,692 --> 01:13:01,196
by the High Elves of the First Age.

1012
01:13:01,696 --> 01:13:03,915
You could not wish for a finer blade.

1013
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,718
- Set it down.  - That's good.

1014
01:13:20,673 --> 01:13:22,346
All right, come on. Quick.

1015
01:13:30,683 --> 01:13:33,357
We're making a long-term deposit.

1016
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:35,579
Let's get out of this foul place.

1017
01:13:36,022 --> 01:13:37,649
Come on, let's go.

1018
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:39,825
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

1019
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,013
- Bilbo.  - Hmm?

1020
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:03,507
Here.

1021
01:14:03,716 --> 01:14:06,265
This is about your size.

1022
01:14:11,932 --> 01:14:13,309
I can't take this.

1023
01:14:13,684 --> 01:14:15,652
The blade is of Elvish make...

1024
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:20,825
which means it will glow blue when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

1025
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:24,328
I have never used a sword in my life.

1026
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:26,455
And I hope you never have to.

1027
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:29,079
But if you do, remember this:

1028
01:14:30,493 --> 01:14:35,795
True courage is about knowing not when to take a life...

1029
01:14:36,457 --> 01:14:38,676
but when to spare one.

1030
01:14:44,006 --> 01:14:45,553
Something's coming!

1031
01:14:45,716 --> 01:14:47,844
- Gandalf.  - Stay together!

1032
01:14:48,678 --> 01:14:52,057
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!

1033
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:13,244
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

1034
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,427
Radagast.

1035
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,804
It's Radagast the Brown.

1036
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,681
Well...

1037
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,560
What on earth are you doing here?

1038
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:26,270
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

1039
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:27,813
Something's wrong.

1040
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,357
Something's terribly wrong.

1041
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,526
Yes?

1042
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,279
Oh.

1043
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,866
Just give me a minute.

1044
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:42,036
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.

1045
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,788
It was right there...

1046
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,665
on the tip of my tongue.

1047
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:46,916
Oh.

1048
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,377
It's not a thought at all.

1049
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,753
It's a silly old...

1050
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,257
stick insect.

1051
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,056
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

1052
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,684
A darkness has fallen over it.

1053
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,936
Nothing grows anymore.

1054
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,313
At least, nothing good.

1055
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,149
The air is foul with decay.

1056
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,110
But worse are the webs.

1057
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,445
Webs? What do you mean?

1058
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,739
Spiders, Gandalf.

1059
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,324
Giant ones.

1060
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:24,870
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant, or I am not a Wizard.

1061
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,248
I followed their trail.

1062
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:30,293
They came from Dol Guldur.

1063
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:32,920
Huh?

1064
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,172
Dol Guldur?

1065
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,593
But the old fortress is abandoned.

1066
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,220
No, Gandalf.

1067
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,557
It's not.

1068
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,568
A dark power dwells in there...

1069
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,695
Such as I have never...

1070
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,488
felt before.

1071
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:05,328
It is The Shadow of an ancient horror.

1072
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:14,754
One that can summon the spirits...

1073
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:15,921
of the dead.

1074
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,940
I saw him, Gandalf.

1075
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,736
From out of the darkness...

1076
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,029
a Necromancer...

1077
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,281
has come.

1078
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,409
Radagast.

1079
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,583
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

1080
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,420
Wait for me!

1081
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:11,977
Sorry.

1082
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,563
Try a little Old Toby.

1083
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,315
It'll help settle your nerves.

1084
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,945
And out.

1085
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,495
Now...

1086
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,207
a Necromancer. Are you sure?

1087
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,264
That is not...

1088
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:52,560
from the world of the living.

1089
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:01,235
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves out there?

1090
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:04,280
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

1091
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,328
Kili! Get your bow!

1092
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,004
Warg scouts.

1093
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,214
Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.

1094
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,340
Orc pack?

1095
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,925
Who did you tell about your quest...

1096
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,343
beyond your kin?

1097
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:27,511
No one.

1098
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,429
Who did you tell?

1099
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,889
No one, I swear.

1100
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,140
What in...

1101
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:32,391
Durin's name is going on?

1102
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:33,768
You are being hunted.

1103
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,687
We have to get out of here.

1104
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,063
We can't. We have no ponies.

1105
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,900
They bolted.

1106
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,401
I'll draw them off.

1107
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:44,361
These are Gundabad Wargs.

1108
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,529
They will outrun you.

1109
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,615
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

1110
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,036
I'd like to see them try.

1111
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,880
Come on! Come on!

1112
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,382
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

1113
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,310
Come on.

1114
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,256
Stay together.

1115
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:46,507
Move!

1116
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,229
Ori, no! Get back.

1117
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,733
All of you, come on. Quick!

1118
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,905
Where are you leading us?

1119
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,516
Move!

1120
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,935
Run!

1121
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,453
There they are!

1122
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,081
This way!

1123
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:43,374
Quickly!

1124
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,178
There's more coming!

1125
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:57,846
Kili!

1126
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,807
Shoot them!

1127
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,813
We're surrounded!

1128
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,568
Where's Gandalf?

1129
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,946
He's abandoned us.

1130
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,287
Hold your ground!

1131
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:32,881
This way, you fools!

1132
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:35,050
Come on, move!

1133
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,095
Quickly!

1134
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:39,263
All of you!

1135
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,889
Come on!

1136
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,766
Go, go, go!

1137
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:54,319
Eight, nine, ten.

1138
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,406
Kili!

1139
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:58,657
Run!

1140
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,157
Elves.

1141
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,036
I cannot see...

1142
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:46,914
where the pathway leads. Do we follow it or no?

1143
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,083
Follow it, of course.

1144
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,421
I think that would be wise.

1145
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,487
Gandalf.

1146
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,531
Where are we?

1147
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:21,657
You can feel it?

1148
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:25,536
Yes. It feels like...

1149
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,496
Well, like magic.

1150
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:30,207
That's exactly what it is.

1151
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,293
A very powerful magic.

1152
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,380
There's light ahead.

1153
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,631
The Valley of Imladris.

1154
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:24,219
In the common tongue, it's known by another name.

1155
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,555
Rivendell.

1156
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:34,313
Here lies the Last Homely House East of the Sea.

1157
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:36,648
This was your plan all along.

1158
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,652
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1159
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,156
You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield.

1160
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,283
The only ill will to be found...

1161
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,327
in this valley is that which you bring yourself.

1162
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,789
You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing?

1163
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,334
They will try to stop us.

1164
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:59,546
Of course they will. But we have questions that need to be answered.

1165
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:06,637
If we are to be successful, this will need to be handled with tact.

1166
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,180
And respect.

1167
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,849
And no small degree of charm.

1168
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,103
Which is why you will leave the talking to me.

1169
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:12,411
Mithrandir.

1170
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:14,913
Ah.

1171
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:16,581
Lindir.

1172
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,375
Stay sharp.

1173
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:20,775


1174
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,672
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1175
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,882
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1176
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,093
Not here?

1177
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:30,095
Where is he?

1178
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,570
Close ranks!

1179
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:11,636
Gandalf.

1180
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,930
Lord Elrond.

1181
01:29:14,888 --> 01:29:16,930


1182
01:29:17,388 --> 01:29:18,630


1183
01:29:18,988 --> 01:29:22,130


1184
01:29:24,988 --> 01:29:27,630


1185
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,743
Strange for Orcs to come so close to our borders.

1186
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:38,914
Something or someone has drawn them near.

1187
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,458
Ah. That may have been us.

1188
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,758
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1189
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:52,386
I do not believe we have met.

1190
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,889
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1191
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:57,641
I knew Thror when he ruled...

1192
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:02,062
- Under the Mountain.  - Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1193
01:30:05,292 --> 01:30:08,862
Nartho i noer, toltho i viruvor. Boe i annam vann a nethail vin.

1194
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:15,492
What is he saying?

1195
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,120
Does he offer us insult?

1196
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:21,998
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

1197
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:29,714
Well...

1198
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,883
in that case, lead on.

1199
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,261
Hey. Come on.

1200
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,389
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1201
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,182
I don't like green food.

1202
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,351
Where's the meat?

1203
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,521
Have they got any chips?

1204
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:46,314
Kind of you...

1205
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:47,941
to invite us.

1206
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,693
Not really dressed for dinner.

1207
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,111
Well, you never are.

1208
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:13,758
I can't say I fancy Elf maids myself, too thin.

1209
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:15,760
They're all high cheekbones...

1210
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,013
and creamy skin.

1211
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,639
Not enough facial hair for me.

1212
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:23,518
Although that one there is not bad.

1213
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,313
That's not an Elf maid.

1214
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,035
That's funny.

1215
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:55,467
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

1216
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:57,260
A famous blade...

1217
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:02,849
forged by the High Elves of the West, my kin.

1218
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:05,393
May it serve you well.

1219
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,436
And this...

1220
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,021
is Glamdring...

1221
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,149
the Foehammer. Sword...

1222
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,485
of the King of Gondolin.

1223
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,196
These were made for the Goblin Wars of the First Age.

1224
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:17,489
I wouldn't bother, laddie.

1225
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:21,159
Swords are named for the great deeds they do in war.

1226
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:23,662
What are you saying, my sword hasn't seen battle?

1227
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:26,164
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1228
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,584
More of a letter opener, really.

1229
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,629
- How did you come by these?  - We found them...

1230
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,131
in a Troll-hoard on the Great East Road...

1231
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:36,633
shortly before...

1232
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,887
- we were ambushed by Orcs.  - And what were you doing...

1233
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:43,306
on the Great East Road?

1234
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:45,684
Excuse me.

1235
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:54,901
Thirteen Dwarves...

1236
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:56,570
and a Halfling. Hm.

1237
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,781
Strange traveling companions, Gandalf.

1238
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,534
These are the descendants of the house of Durin.

1239
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,744
They're noble, decent folk.

1240
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,622
And they're surprisingly cultured.

1241
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:08,873
They've got a deep love...

1242
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,668
- of the arts.  - Change the tune, why don't you?

1243
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,503
I feel like I'm at a funeral.

1244
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,130
- Did somebody die?  - All right...

1245
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,716
lads. There's only one thing for it.

1246
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:21,678
# There's #

1247
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:24,598
# An #

1248
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,225
# Inn, there's an inn There's a merry old inn #

1249
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:29,144
# Beneath an old gray hill #

1250
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,606
# And there they brew a beer so brown The man in the moon #

1251
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,107
# Himself came down one night #

1252
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:35,233
# To drink his fill #

1253
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:36,610
# Oh #

1254
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,278
# The ostler has a tipsy cat #

1255
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,238
# That played a five-stringed fiddle #

1256
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:42,449
# And up and down he saws his bow #

1257
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,242
# Now squeaking high #

1258
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:47,746
# Now purring low #

1259
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,916
# Now sawing in the middle #

1260
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,168
# So #

1261
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:53,918
# The cat on the fiddle #

1262
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,379
# Played hey-diddle-diddle A drink that'll wake the dead #

1263
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,590
# He squeaked and he sawed And he quickened #

1264
01:33:58,841 --> 01:33:59,466
# The tune and the landlord #

1265
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:00,425
# Shook the man #

1266
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:01,384
# In the Moon "It's after #

1267
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:02,469
# Three!" he said #

1268
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,188
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1269
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,190
For goodness sake, Thorin...

1270
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:17,067
- show him the map.  - It is the legacy...

1271
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:18,568
of my people.

1272
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:22,322
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

1273
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:25,033
Save me from the stubbornness of Dwarves.

1274
01:34:25,284 --> 01:34:28,161
Your pride will be your downfall.

1275
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:31,247
You stand in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth...

1276
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:35,085
who can read that map. Show it to Lord Elrond.

1277
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:43,051
Thorin, no.

1278
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:54,979
Erebor.

1279
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,149
What is your interest...

1280
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,068
in this map?

1281
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,821
It's mainly academic.

1282
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,114
As you know...

1283
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:07,867
this sort of artifact sometimes contains hidden text.

1284
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,459
You still read ancient Dwarvish, do you not?

1285
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:23,459
Cirth Ithil

1286
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,970
Moon runes?

1287
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:28,847
Of course.

1288
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:31,558
An easy thing to miss.

1289
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,351
Well, in this case, that is true.

1290
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:36,020
Moon runes can only be read by the light of a moon...

1291
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,356
of the same shape and season...

1292
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:40,608
as the day on which they were written.

1293
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:43,194
Can you read them?

1294
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,827
These runes were written on a Midsummer's Eve...

1295
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:55,290
by the light of a crescent moon nearly 200 years ago.

1296
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:58,752
It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell.

1297
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,879
Fate is with you...

1298
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,839
Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon...

1299
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,133
shines upon us tonight.

1300
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:25,403
"Stand by the...

1301
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:28,990
gray stone when the thrush knocks...

1302
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:33,995
and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day...

1303
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:38,541
- will shine upon the keyhole. "  - Durin's Day?

1304
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:42,170
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year, when the last moon of autumn...

1305
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:45,215
and the first sun of winter appear in the sky together.

1306
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,424
This is ill news.

1307
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:50,011
Summer is passing. Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1308
01:36:50,262 --> 01:36:51,471
We still have time.

1309
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:54,098
- Time? For what?  - To find the entrance.

1310
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:58,061
We have to be standing in exactly the right spot at exactly the right time.

1311
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:02,023
Then, and only then, can the door be opened.

1312
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:02,941
So this is...

1313
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,777
your purpose, to enter the mountain?

1314
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:07,987
What of it?

1315
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,157
There are some who would not deem it wise.

1316
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:13,868
What do you mean?

1317
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:19,916
You are not the only guardian to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1318
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:48,116


1319
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,616


1320
01:37:55,071 --> 01:37:59,216


1321
01:37:59,217 --> 01:38:03,016


1322
01:38:08,571 --> 01:38:13,116


1323
01:38:13,117 --> 01:38:15,016


1324
01:38:15,017 --> 01:38:17,216


1325
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:20,916


1326
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:23,916


1327
01:38:25,117 --> 01:38:27,216


1328
01:38:46,517 --> 01:38:52,316


1329
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:55,116


1330
01:38:56,517 --> 01:38:59,516


1331
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:19,637
Not with your...

1332
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:20,847
companions?

1333
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:25,351
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

1334
01:40:28,313 --> 01:40:32,400
The truth is that most of them don't think I should be on this journey.

1335
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:35,028
Indeed?

1336
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,032
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

1337
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:43,661
Really?

1338
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:45,747
Mm.

1339
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:54,130
I've also heard they're fond of the comforts of home.

1340
01:40:57,676 --> 01:41:00,386
I've heard that it's unwise to seek the council of Elves.

1341
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:03,473
That they will answer with yes and no.

1342
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:14,901
You are very welcome to stay here, if that...

1343
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,486
is your wish.

1344
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:25,486


1345
01:41:25,492 --> 01:41:28,686


1346
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:31,886


1347
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,520
No, you did the same thing. It's not like you didn't do it.

1348
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:53,940
Dori! Here, take that.

1349
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:00,113
Bombur!

1350
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,007
Of course I was going to tell you. I was waiting...

1351
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:25,054
for this very chance. And really, I think you can trust that I know what I am doing.

1352
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,807
Do you? That dragon has slept...

1353
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,600
for 60 years.

1354
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,853
What will happen if your plan should fail...

1355
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,814
- if you wake that beast?  - What if we succeed?

1356
01:42:35,065 --> 01:42:37,150
If the Dwarves take back the mountain...

1357
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,026
our defenses in the east will be strengthened.

1358
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,612
It is a dangerous move, Gandalf.

1359
01:42:41,864 --> 01:42:43,656
It is also dangerous to do nothing.

1360
01:42:43,907 --> 01:42:48,161
Oh, come, the throne of Erebor is Thorin's birthright. What is it you fear?

1361
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:49,745
Have you forgotten?

1362
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:53,291
A strain of madness runs deep in that family.

1363
01:42:54,084 --> 01:42:56,752
His grandfather lost his mind. His father succumbed to...

1364
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,504
the same sickness.

1365
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:01,257
Can you swear Thorin Oakenshield...

1366
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,301
will not also fall?

1367
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:09,974
Gandalf, these decisions do not rest with us alone. It is not...

1368
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:13,978
up to you or me to redraw the map of Middle-earth.

1369
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:18,649
With or without our help, these Dwarves will march on the mountain.

1370
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,736
They're determined to reclaim their homeland.

1371
01:43:21,987 --> 01:43:27,074
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1372
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,951
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1373
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,705
It is not me you must answer to.

1374
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:46,594
Lady Galadriel.

1375
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,055
Mithrandir.

1376
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:58,055


1377
01:43:58,312 --> 01:44:03,355


1378
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:10,618
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1379
01:44:11,536 --> 01:44:13,162
He didn't.

1380
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,248
I did.

1381
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:21,921
Ah.

1382
01:44:23,423 --> 01:44:25,091
Saruman.

1383
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:29,470
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1384
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,306
Tell me, Gandalf...

1385
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:36,018
did you think these plans and schemes of yours...

1386
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,104
would go unnoticed?

1387
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:40,314
Unnoticed?

1388
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:42,358
No.

1389
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,735
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1390
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:48,656
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1391
01:44:49,157 --> 01:44:51,117
That is true, my lady.

1392
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:53,661
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1393
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:56,664
But if he should side with The Enemy...

1394
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:59,750
a dragon could be used to terrible effect.

1395
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,502
What enemy?

1396
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:05,047
Gandalf, The Enemy is defeated.

1397
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:10,136
Sauron is vanquished. He can never regain his full strength.

1398
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:15,599
Does it not worry you that the last of the Dwarf rings...

1399
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:17,685
should simply vanish...

1400
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,937
along with its bearer?

1401
01:45:20,188 --> 01:45:23,899
Of the seven Dwarf rings, four were consumed by dragons...

1402
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:27,361
two were taken by Sauron before he fell in Mordor.

1403
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:32,074
The fate of the last Dwarf ring remains unknown.

1404
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,288
The ring that was worn by Thrain.

1405
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,498
Without the ruling Ring of Power...

1406
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,376
the seven are of no value to The Enemy.

1407
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,254
To control...

1408
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:46,630
the other rings...

1409
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:50,551
he needs the One.

1410
01:45:50,802 --> 01:45:53,346
And that ring was lost long, long ago.

1411
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:54,555
It was swept out...

1412
01:45:54,806 --> 01:45:57,266
to sea by the waters of the Anduin.

1413
01:45:57,517 --> 01:46:02,605
Gandalf, for 400 years we have lived in peace...

1414
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,357
a hard-won...

1415
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:05,858
watchful peace.

1416
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:08,819
Are we? Are we at peace?

1417
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:14,283
Trolls have come down from the mountains. They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1418
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:17,578
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1419
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:19,580
Hardly a prelude to war.

1420
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:21,999
Always you must meddle...

1421
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:24,168
looking for trouble where none exists.

1422
01:46:24,419 --> 01:46:26,545
Let him speak.

1423
01:46:27,672 --> 01:46:32,593
There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug.

1424
01:46:32,844 --> 01:46:35,137
Something far more powerful.

1425
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:41,394
We can remain blind to it, but it will not be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1426
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:43,521
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1427
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:47,400
The woodsmen who live there now call it Mirkwood.

1428
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:48,984
And they say...

1429
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:51,987
Well?

1430
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,031
Don't stop now.

1431
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:56,534
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1432
01:46:56,785 --> 01:46:59,036
They speak of a Necromancer...

1433
01:46:59,287 --> 01:47:00,413
living in Dol Guldur.

1434
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:03,624
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1435
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,209
That's absurd.

1436
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,212
No such power exists in this world.

1437
01:47:08,463 --> 01:47:12,508
This Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man.

1438
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:15,302
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1439
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:17,054
And so I thought too.

1440
01:47:17,305 --> 01:47:20,724
- But Radagast has seen...  - Radagast?

1441
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:24,270
Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown.

1442
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:26,272
He's a foolish fellow.

1443
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:30,651
Well, he's odd, I grant you. He lives a solitary life.

1444
01:47:30,902 --> 01:47:33,112
It's not that. It's his excessive...

1445
01:47:33,363 --> 01:47:35,239
consumption of mushrooms.

1446
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:37,158
They've addled his brain...

1447
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,827
and yellowed his teeth.

1448
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:41,620
I've warned him.

1449
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,040
It is unbefitting one of the Istari to be wandering the woods...

1450
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,918
You carry something.

1451
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:52,006
It came to you from Radagast.

1452
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:55,468
He found it in Dol Guldur.

1453
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:57,761
Yes.

1454
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:00,806
Show me.

1455
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,476
listen to me.

1456
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:07,480
I would think I was talking to myself for all the attention that he paid.

1457
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,690
By all means...

1458
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:11,901
What is that?

1459
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:16,530
A relic of Mordor.

1460
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:28,959
A Morgul Blade.

1461
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:32,296
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1462
01:48:32,547 --> 01:48:35,674
And buried with him.

1463
01:48:37,802 --> 01:48:39,803
When Angmar fell...

1464
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:42,598
the Men of the North took his body...

1465
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:46,810
and all that he possessed and sealed it within the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1466
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:49,980
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1467
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,567
in a tomb so dark...

1468
01:48:54,152 --> 01:48:55,694
it would never come to light.

1469
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,072
This is not possible.

1470
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:01,742
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1471
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:03,786
They cannot be opened.

1472
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:08,832
What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar's grave?

1473
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,501
I have none.

1474
01:49:10,752 --> 01:49:12,253
Because there is none.

1475
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:15,381
Let us examine what we know.

1476
01:49:16,174 --> 01:49:18,342
A single Orc pack...

1477
01:49:18,593 --> 01:49:20,844
has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1478
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,682
A dagger from a bygone age has been found.

1479
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:30,229
And a human sorcerer who calls himself "The Necromancer"...

1480
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:34,358
has taken up residence in a ruined fortress.

1481
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:38,946
It's not so very much after all.

1482
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:42,491
The question of this Dwarvish company, however...

1483
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,368
troubles me deeply.

1484
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:46,245
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1485
01:49:46,496 --> 01:49:49,915
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1486
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:54,503
If they'd come to me, I might have spared them this disappointment.

1487
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:57,798
I do not pretend to understand your reason for raising their hopes.

1488
01:49:58,049 --> 01:49:59,675
They are leaving.

1489
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:03,721
Yes.

1490
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:07,474
You knew.

1491
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:13,147
No, I'm afraid there is...

1492
01:50:13,398 --> 01:50:15,482
nothing else for it.

1493
01:50:17,485 --> 01:50:18,360
My Lord Elrond.

1494
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:22,364
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1495
01:50:27,662 --> 01:50:29,538
Be on your guard.

1496
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:32,082
We're about to step over the Edge of the Wild.

1497
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:34,918
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1498
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:36,754
Aye.

1499
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:43,385
Master Baggins...

1500
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:46,722
I suggest you keep up.

1501
01:51:00,236 --> 01:51:01,236
You will follow them.

1502
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:03,155
Yes.

1503
01:51:03,406 --> 01:51:06,450
You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield.

1504
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:09,870
But I fear this quest has set in motion...

1505
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:13,415
forces we do not yet understand.

1506
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:17,670
The riddle of the Morgul Blade must be answered.

1507
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:21,382
Something moves in the shadows unseen, hidden from our sight.

1508
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,592
It will not show itself.

1509
01:51:23,843 --> 01:51:25,552
Not yet.

1510
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:28,555
But every day it grows in strength.

1511
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:30,516
You must be careful.

1512
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:36,230
Mithrandir?

1513
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:40,526
Why the Halfling?

1514
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:44,446
I do not know.

1515
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,953
Saruman believes that it is only great power...

1516
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:54,081
that can hold evil in check.

1517
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,042
But that is not what I have found.

1518
01:51:58,169 --> 01:52:01,839
I have found it is the small things...

1519
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:04,383
everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1520
01:52:04,634 --> 01:52:07,594
that keeps the darkness at bay.

1521
01:52:08,304 --> 01:52:11,598
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1522
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:16,353
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1523
01:52:18,773 --> 01:52:21,483
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1524
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:25,821
and he gives me courage.

1525
01:52:30,618 --> 01:52:33,787
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1526
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:37,124
You are not alone.

1527
01:52:41,749 --> 01:52:43,124


1528
01:52:43,149 --> 01:52:45,124


1529
01:54:17,392 --> 01:54:20,102
Hey! Hold on!

1530
01:54:26,317 --> 01:54:27,150
Aah!

1531
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:28,443
Bilbo!

1532
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,905
We must find...

1533
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:33,866
shelter!

1534
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:35,617
Look out!

1535
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:42,875
Look out, brother!

1536
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,252
Hold on!

1537
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:50,716
This is no thunderstorm.

1538
01:54:51,259 --> 01:54:53,635
It's a thunder-battle!

1539
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:55,596
Look!

1540
01:55:00,643 --> 01:55:02,603
Well, bless me.

1541
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:04,563
The legends are true.

1542
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:08,734
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1543
01:55:15,867 --> 01:55:16,700
Take cover, you fool!

1544
01:55:18,786 --> 01:55:20,495
Hold on!

1545
01:55:28,796 --> 01:55:29,796
What's happening?

1546
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:31,214
Grab my hand!

1547
01:55:55,156 --> 01:55:56,114
Go, go, go!

1548
01:55:56,366 --> 01:55:57,032
Run! Get off!

1549
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:58,367
Get off!

1550
01:56:02,455 --> 01:56:03,997
- Run!  - Hold on!

1551
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:10,754
Look out!

1552
01:56:31,901 --> 01:56:33,443
Jump!

1553
01:56:33,695 --> 01:56:34,820
Come on!

1554
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:40,283
Hold on!

1555
01:56:48,376 --> 01:56:49,042
No!

1556
01:56:50,753 --> 01:56:52,254
No!

1557
01:57:01,014 --> 01:57:01,680
No!

1558
01:57:01,931 --> 01:57:03,348
Kili!

1559
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:11,648
It's all right! They're alive!

1560
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:14,026
Where's Bilbo?

1561
01:57:14,652 --> 01:57:15,652
Where's the Hobbit?

1562
01:57:17,238 --> 01:57:17,946
There!

1563
01:57:21,492 --> 01:57:22,409
Get him!

1564
01:57:23,745 --> 01:57:24,745
Aah!

1565
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:25,662
Grab my hand!

1566
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:26,580
Bilbo!

1567
01:57:28,624 --> 01:57:29,666
Ori, be careful!

1568
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:31,043
Take it!

1569
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:32,461
I've got you, lad.

1570
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:33,754
Grab on! Grab on!

1571
01:57:43,931 --> 01:57:44,639
Come on.

1572
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:46,683
Get him.

1573
01:57:46,934 --> 01:57:48,602
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1574
01:57:51,773 --> 01:57:53,273
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1575
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:57,235
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1576
01:57:58,071 --> 01:57:59,780
He should never have come.

1577
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:02,032
He has no place amongst us.

1578
01:58:03,951 --> 01:58:05,410
Dwalin!

1579
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:12,709
It looks safe enough.

1580
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,211
Search to the back.

1581
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:17,464
Caves in the mountain are seldom unoccupied.

1582
01:58:20,968 --> 01:58:22,928
There's nothing here.

1583
01:58:24,806 --> 01:58:26,848
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1584
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,935
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1585
01:58:30,186 --> 01:58:31,812
Get some sleep.

1586
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:34,231
We start at first light.

1587
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:38,360
We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalfjoined us.

1588
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:39,903
That was the plan.

1589
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:41,488
Plans change.

1590
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:45,200
Bofur, take the first watch.

1591
01:59:59,233 --> 01:59:59,900
Where do you think...

1592
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:01,651
you're going?

1593
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:05,739
Back to Rivendell.

1594
02:00:06,908 --> 02:00:09,159
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1595
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:10,660
You're part of the company.

1596
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:12,287
You're one of us.

1597
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:13,830
I'm not, though, am I?

1598
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:18,168
Thorin said I should never have come and he was right.

1599
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:19,961
I'm not a Took...

1600
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:23,173
I'm a Baggins. I don't know what I was thinking.

1601
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:26,218
I should never have run out my door.

1602
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:28,637
You're homesick. I understand.

1603
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:31,306
No, you don't. You don't understand. None of you do.

1604
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:34,184
You're Dwarves. You're used to this life.

1605
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:35,644
To living on the road...

1606
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:38,188
never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere!

1607
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:43,777
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

1608
02:00:49,533 --> 02:00:51,117
No, you're right.

1609
02:00:54,538 --> 02:00:56,456
We don't belong anywhere.

1610
02:01:04,757 --> 02:01:07,008
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1611
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,263
I really do.

1612
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:16,935
What's that?

1613
02:01:19,730 --> 02:01:21,106
Hmm?

1614
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:41,001
Wake up!

1615
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:42,043
Wake up!

1616
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:43,295
Whoa!

1617
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:06,609
Look out! Look out!

1618
02:02:10,823 --> 02:02:11,489
Get away!

1619
02:02:16,537 --> 02:02:17,203
Filthy scum!

1620
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:19,247
Get back!

1621
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,086
You'll pay for this!

1622
02:02:32,428 --> 02:02:34,054
Got you.

1623
02:02:35,264 --> 02:02:36,598
All right, all right.

1624
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:41,853
Get off! Get your hands off me! Get off me!

1625
02:02:47,401 --> 02:02:48,568
Get off me!

1626
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:33,965
I feel a song coming on.

1627
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,887
# Clap, snap, the black crack #

1628
02:04:39,138 --> 02:04:41,556
# Grip, grab, pinch and nab #

1629
02:04:41,807 --> 02:04:43,433
# Batter and beat #

1630
02:04:43,684 --> 02:04:46,186
# Make'em stammer and #

1631
02:04:46,437 --> 02:04:47,896
# Squeak #

1632
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:53,026
# Pound, pound, far #

1633
02:04:53,277 --> 02:04:58,615
# Underground #

1634
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,911
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1635
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:04,996
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1636
02:05:05,247 --> 02:05:08,333
# With a swish and a smack and a whip and a crack #

1637
02:05:08,584 --> 02:05:11,294
# Everybody talks when they're on my rack #

1638
02:05:11,545 --> 02:05:14,839
# Pound,pound, far underground #

1639
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:17,842
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1640
02:05:18,093 --> 02:05:20,720
# Down, down, down in Goblin-town #

1641
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:23,598
# Hammer and tongs get out your knockers and gongs #

1642
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:29,062
# You won't last long on the end of my prong #

1643
02:05:29,772 --> 02:05:31,189
# Clash, crash #

1644
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:32,899
# Crush and smash #

1645
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:35,443
# Bang, break, shiver and shake #

1646
02:05:35,694 --> 02:05:39,822
# You can yammer and yelp, but there ain't no help#

1647
02:05:40,407 --> 02:05:45,078
# Pound, pound, far underground #

1648
02:05:45,913 --> 02:05:49,040
# Down, down, down in Goblin... #

1649
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:52,210
# Town #

1650
02:05:57,091 --> 02:05:59,592
Yeah!

1651
02:06:08,811 --> 02:06:10,562
Catchy, isn't it?

1652
02:06:10,896 --> 02:06:14,315
It's one of my own compositions.

1653
02:06:14,733 --> 02:06:16,109
That's not a song.

1654
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,027
It's an abomination!

1655
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:19,237
Abomination.

1656
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:21,948
Mutations. Deviations.

1657
02:06:22,199 --> 02:06:25,076
That's all you're gonna find down here.

1658
02:06:28,998 --> 02:06:34,335
Who would be so bold as to come armed into my kingdom?

1659
02:06:34,628 --> 02:06:35,545
Spies?

1660
02:06:35,796 --> 02:06:36,713
Thieves?

1661
02:06:36,964 --> 02:06:38,047
Assassins?

1662
02:06:38,299 --> 02:06:39,924
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.

1663
02:06:40,175 --> 02:06:41,217
Dwarves?

1664
02:06:42,094 --> 02:06:43,761
We found them on the Front Porch.

1665
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,764
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.

1666
02:06:48,517 --> 02:06:49,642
Every crack.

1667
02:06:49,893 --> 02:06:51,060
Every crevice.

1668
02:06:57,776 --> 02:06:58,693
It is my belief...

1669
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:01,237
your great protuberance, that they...

1670
02:07:01,488 --> 02:07:03,197
are in league with Elves!

1671
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:07,118
"Made in Rivendell. " Ah.

1672
02:07:07,494 --> 02:07:10,455
Second Age. Couldn't give it away.

1673
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:15,835
Just a couple of keepsakes.

1674
02:07:16,086 --> 02:07:18,212
What are you doing in these parts?

1675
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:23,343
Uh, don't worry, lads. I'll handle this.

1676
02:07:23,594 --> 02:07:24,886
What's... What's that?

1677
02:07:25,137 --> 02:07:29,891
No tricks. I want the truth, warts and all.

1678
02:07:30,142 --> 02:07:32,727
You're going to have to speak up.

1679
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:35,396
Your boys flattened my trumpet.

1680
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,732
I'll flatten more than your trumpet!

1681
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,487
If it's more information you want, I'm the one you should speak to.

1682
02:07:44,156 --> 02:07:44,864
Mm-hm.

1683
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:51,663
We were on the road. Well, it's not so much a road as a path.

1684
02:07:51,914 --> 02:07:54,374
It's not even that, come to think of it. More like a track.

1685
02:07:54,708 --> 02:07:58,127
Anyway, the point is, we were on this road, like a path, like a track.

1686
02:07:58,379 --> 02:08:01,756
And then we weren't, which is a problem, because we were...

1687
02:08:02,007 --> 02:08:03,091
- supposed to be in Dunland...  - Shut up.

1688
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:04,509
last Tuesday.

1689
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,260
Visiting distant relations.

1690
02:08:06,762 --> 02:08:08,471
Some inbreds on me mother's side.

1691
02:08:08,722 --> 02:08:10,181
Shut up!

1692
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,896
If they will not talk, we'll make them squawk.

1693
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:19,107
Bring up the mangler.

1694
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:22,110
Bring up the bonebreaker.

1695
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:23,486
Start with the youngest.

1696
02:08:24,279 --> 02:08:25,446
Wait!

1697
02:08:27,991 --> 02:08:30,785
Well, well, well.

1698
02:08:31,495 --> 02:08:32,662
Look who it is.

1699
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:38,209
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1700
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:42,088
King Under the Mountain.

1701
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:46,884
Oh, but I'm forgetting. You don't have a mountain.

1702
02:08:47,136 --> 02:08:48,678
And you're not a king...

1703
02:08:48,929 --> 02:08:49,971
which makes you...

1704
02:08:51,306 --> 02:08:53,224
nobody, really.

1705
02:08:56,645 --> 02:09:01,482
I know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head.

1706
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:04,235
Just a head.

1707
02:09:04,486 --> 02:09:06,154
Nothing attached.

1708
02:09:07,948 --> 02:09:10,700
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

1709
02:09:11,285 --> 02:09:13,995
An old enemy of yours.

1710
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:20,960
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1711
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:25,715
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1712
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,344
He was slain in battle long ago.

1713
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:34,307
So you think his defiling days are done, do you?

1714
02:09:36,435 --> 02:09:38,853
Send word to the pale Orc.

1715
02:09:39,104 --> 02:09:41,773
Tell him I have found his prize.

1716
02:10:19,603 --> 02:10:20,686
Yes.

1717
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:23,856
Yes.

1718
02:10:24,983 --> 02:10:27,318
Yes.

1719
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:31,322
Yes!

1720
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:33,407
Gollum, gollum!

1721
02:10:57,891 --> 02:10:59,308
Aah!

1722
02:11:02,062 --> 02:11:05,106
Nasty Goblinses!

1723
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,568
Better than old bones, precious.

1724
02:11:08,819 --> 02:11:10,695
Better than nothing.

1725
02:11:39,141 --> 02:11:43,811
Too many boneses, precious. Not enough flesh!

1726
02:11:44,062 --> 02:11:47,440
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1727
02:11:48,442 --> 02:11:49,358
Start with its head.

1728
02:11:55,782 --> 02:11:59,493
# The cold hard lands. They bites our hands #

1729
02:11:59,745 --> 02:12:02,997
# They gnaws our feet #

1730
02:12:03,248 --> 02:12:07,293
# The rocks and stones. They're like old bones #

1731
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,087
# All bare of meat #

1732
02:12:10,339 --> 02:12:13,716
# Cold as death. Without no breath #

1733
02:12:14,134 --> 02:12:15,176
# It's good to eat #

1734
02:12:54,466 --> 02:12:56,759
Bless us and splash us...

1735
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:58,636
precious.

1736
02:12:58,887 --> 02:13:00,763
That's a meaty mouthful.

1737
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:05,309
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

1738
02:13:06,603 --> 02:13:08,896
Back. Stay back.

1739
02:13:09,147 --> 02:13:10,856
I'm warning you...

1740
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:13,359
don't come any closer.

1741
02:13:14,444 --> 02:13:16,529
It's got an Elfish blade.

1742
02:13:16,780 --> 02:13:19,156
But it's not an Elfs.

1743
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:22,284
Not an Elfs, no.

1744
02:13:22,786 --> 02:13:24,495
What is it, precious?

1745
02:13:25,622 --> 02:13:26,998
What is it?

1746
02:13:27,249 --> 02:13:30,668
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

1747
02:13:31,628 --> 02:13:33,546
Bagginses?

1748
02:13:34,256 --> 02:13:37,758
What is a Bagginses, precious?

1749
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:42,221
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.  - Oh.

1750
02:13:42,472 --> 02:13:47,810
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes. But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

1751
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:51,939
Is it soft? Is it juicy?

1752
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:53,315
Now, now...

1753
02:13:53,567 --> 02:13:55,693
keep your distance!

1754
02:13:55,944 --> 02:13:57,820
I'll use this if I have to.

1755
02:13:58,071 --> 02:13:58,946
Aah!

1756
02:13:59,197 --> 02:14:00,322
I don't want any trouble.

1757
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:01,991
Do you understand?

1758
02:14:02,242 --> 02:14:05,244
Just show me the way to get out of here and I'll be on my way.

1759
02:14:05,495 --> 02:14:07,329
Why? Is it lost?

1760
02:14:07,581 --> 02:14:11,333
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost as soon as possible.

1761
02:14:11,585 --> 02:14:14,503
Ooh, we knows! We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.

1762
02:14:15,338 --> 02:14:16,213
Safe paths in...

1763
02:14:16,465 --> 02:14:17,757
the dark. Shut up!

1764
02:14:18,133 --> 02:14:19,133
I didn't say anything.

1765
02:14:19,384 --> 02:14:21,343
We wasn't talking to you.

1766
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:24,305
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

1767
02:14:24,681 --> 02:14:26,891
Look, I don't know what your game is...

1768
02:14:27,142 --> 02:14:27,808
but I...

1769
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,060
Games?

1770
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:32,521
Oh, we love games, doesn't we, precious?

1771
02:14:32,773 --> 02:14:34,982
Does it like games? Does it, does it?

1772
02:14:35,233 --> 02:14:36,942
Does it like to play?

1773
02:14:37,819 --> 02:14:39,111
Maybe.

1774
02:14:41,364 --> 02:14:45,910
What has roots as nobody sees?

1775
02:14:46,161 --> 02:14:48,829
Is taller than trees?

1776
02:14:49,081 --> 02:14:51,082
Up, up, up it goes

1777
02:14:51,333 --> 02:14:52,166
And yet

1778
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:54,210
Never grows

1779
02:14:55,295 --> 02:14:55,961
The mountain.

1780
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:57,797
Yes, yes.

1781
02:14:58,048 --> 02:15:01,175
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

1782
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:03,177
Yes! Do it again.

1783
02:15:03,428 --> 02:15:04,762
Do it again. Ask us.

1784
02:15:05,013 --> 02:15:06,639
No! No more riddles.

1785
02:15:08,391 --> 02:15:09,183
Finish him off.

1786
02:15:10,519 --> 02:15:12,895
Finish him now! Gollum, gollum!

1787
02:15:13,146 --> 02:15:14,855
No! No. No.

1788
02:15:15,107 --> 02:15:18,109
No. I want to play. I do.

1789
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,903
I want to play. I can see...

1790
02:15:21,154 --> 02:15:24,824
you are very good at this.

1791
02:15:25,492 --> 02:15:27,201
So why don't we...

1792
02:15:29,162 --> 02:15:31,413
have a game of riddles? Yes?

1793
02:15:31,665 --> 02:15:33,290
Just you and me.

1794
02:15:33,792 --> 02:15:37,920
Yes. Yes, just us.

1795
02:15:38,171 --> 02:15:40,131
Yes. Yes.

1796
02:15:40,382 --> 02:15:42,466
And if I win...

1797
02:15:42,717 --> 02:15:45,636
you show me the way out. Yes?

1798
02:15:45,887 --> 02:15:47,596
Yes. Yes.

1799
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:49,557
And if it loses?

1800
02:15:49,808 --> 02:15:51,433
What then?

1801
02:15:51,685 --> 02:15:55,104
Well, if it loses, precious, then we eats it.

1802
02:15:56,356 --> 02:15:59,984
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

1803
02:16:06,533 --> 02:16:07,491
Fair enough.

1804
02:16:12,455 --> 02:16:13,956
Well, Baggins first.

1805
02:16:20,755 --> 02:16:23,299
Thirty white horses on a red hill

1806
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:25,593
First they champ

1807
02:16:25,844 --> 02:16:26,844
Then they stamp

1808
02:16:27,095 --> 02:16:28,637
Then they stand still

1809
02:16:39,524 --> 02:16:40,566
Teeth?

1810
02:16:41,902 --> 02:16:42,985
Teeth!

1811
02:16:43,236 --> 02:16:45,779
Oh, yes, my precious!

1812
02:16:46,406 --> 02:16:49,116
But we... We...

1813
02:16:49,367 --> 02:16:52,494
only have nine.

1814
02:16:55,498 --> 02:16:56,790
Our turn.

1815
02:16:58,627 --> 02:17:00,336
Voiceless, it cries

1816
02:17:00,837 --> 02:17:03,297
Wingless flutters

1817
02:17:03,965 --> 02:17:07,051
Toothless bites

1818
02:17:07,302 --> 02:17:08,594
Mouthless

1819
02:17:08,845 --> 02:17:10,512
Mutters

1820
02:17:13,391 --> 02:17:14,725
Just a minute.

1821
02:17:14,976 --> 02:17:16,143
Uh...

1822
02:17:17,103 --> 02:17:18,479
Oh. Oh!

1823
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:20,356
We knows! We knows!

1824
02:17:20,607 --> 02:17:21,315
Shut up!

1825
02:17:28,156 --> 02:17:29,406
Wind.

1826
02:17:29,658 --> 02:17:30,741
It's wind.

1827
02:17:30,992 --> 02:17:32,117
Of course it is.

1828
02:17:32,369 --> 02:17:33,869
Very clever...

1829
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:35,663
Hobbitses.

1830
02:17:36,289 --> 02:17:37,498
Very clever.

1831
02:17:37,749 --> 02:17:38,624
Ah-ah-ah.

1832
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:39,833
A box without hinges

1833
02:17:40,835 --> 02:17:43,462
Key or lid

1834
02:17:43,713 --> 02:17:44,588
Yet golden treasure

1835
02:17:44,839 --> 02:17:47,466
Inside is hid

1836
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:51,387
Box.

1837
02:17:51,721 --> 02:17:54,056
Oh, um...

1838
02:17:54,307 --> 02:17:56,058
Box. The lid and a key.

1839
02:17:56,643 --> 02:17:57,685
Well?

1840
02:17:57,936 --> 02:17:59,895
It's nasty.

1841
02:18:01,982 --> 02:18:03,482
Box. Key.

1842
02:18:03,733 --> 02:18:04,441
Do you give up?

1843
02:18:04,693 --> 02:18:07,194
Give us a chance, precious! Give us a chance!

1844
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:22,251
Eggses!

1845
02:18:22,794 --> 02:18:24,420
Eggses!

1846
02:18:24,671 --> 02:18:25,671
Wet, crunchy...

1847
02:18:25,922 --> 02:18:28,048
little eggses. Yes.

1848
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:30,551
Grandmother taught us...

1849
02:18:30,802 --> 02:18:32,803
to suck them, yes!

1850
02:18:40,937 --> 02:18:42,062
We have one...

1851
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:44,356
for you.

1852
02:18:44,983 --> 02:18:48,986
All things it devours

1853
02:18:49,237 --> 02:18:50,779
Birds, beasts

1854
02:18:51,031 --> 02:18:54,283
Trees, flowers

1855
02:18:54,534 --> 02:18:56,076
Gnaws iron

1856
02:18:56,328 --> 02:18:58,662
Bites steel

1857
02:18:58,913 --> 02:19:02,666
Grinds hard stones to meal

1858
02:19:04,127 --> 02:19:05,085
Answer us.

1859
02:19:06,004 --> 02:19:10,466
Give me a moment, please. I gave you a good long while.

1860
02:19:10,842 --> 02:19:14,386
Birds, beasts... Beasts? Trees, flowers.

1861
02:19:14,637 --> 02:19:15,971
I don't know this one.

1862
02:19:16,222 --> 02:19:18,057
Is it tasty?

1863
02:19:19,601 --> 02:19:22,686
Is it scrumptious?

1864
02:19:24,147 --> 02:19:25,606
Is it crunchable?

1865
02:19:25,982 --> 02:19:27,232
Let me think.

1866
02:19:27,484 --> 02:19:28,776
Let me think.

1867
02:19:33,573 --> 02:19:35,657
It's stuck.

1868
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:41,205
Bagginses is stuck.

1869
02:19:44,751 --> 02:19:46,377
Time's up.

1870
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:51,924
Time.

1871
02:19:52,175 --> 02:19:53,133
The answer...

1872
02:19:53,593 --> 02:19:54,760
is time.

1873
02:19:57,055 --> 02:19:58,472
Actually it wasn't that hard.

1874
02:20:00,892 --> 02:20:02,184
Last question.

1875
02:20:03,895 --> 02:20:05,604
Last chance.

1876
02:20:05,855 --> 02:20:07,523
Okay.

1877
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:11,819
Ask us.

1878
02:20:13,279 --> 02:20:13,946
Ask us!

1879
02:20:14,197 --> 02:20:15,989
Yes, yes. All right.

1880
02:20:20,245 --> 02:20:22,454
What have I got...

1881
02:20:22,705 --> 02:20:24,581
in my pocket?

1882
02:20:27,460 --> 02:20:29,461
That's no fair.

1883
02:20:30,213 --> 02:20:32,131
It's not fair! It's against...

1884
02:20:32,382 --> 02:20:33,340
the rules!

1885
02:20:35,301 --> 02:20:36,718
Now ask us another one.

1886
02:20:37,137 --> 02:20:38,429
No. No, no, no.

1887
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:42,558
You said ask me a question. Well, that is my question.

1888
02:20:42,809 --> 02:20:45,060
What have I got in my pocket?

1889
02:20:46,646 --> 02:20:49,022
Three guesses, precious. It must give us...

1890
02:20:49,274 --> 02:20:50,107
three!

1891
02:20:50,358 --> 02:20:52,568
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

1892
02:20:52,819 --> 02:20:54,653
- Handses!  - Wrong.

1893
02:20:54,904 --> 02:20:55,863
Guess again.

1894
02:20:57,365 --> 02:21:01,201
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth, wet shells, bats' wings...

1895
02:21:03,997 --> 02:21:06,081
Knife! Oh, shut up!

1896
02:21:06,332 --> 02:21:08,041
Wrong again. Last guess.

1897
02:21:08,293 --> 02:21:09,501
String.

1898
02:21:10,128 --> 02:21:11,336
Or nothing.

1899
02:21:11,588 --> 02:21:15,466
Two guesses at once. Wrong both times.

1900
02:21:18,595 --> 02:21:19,887
So...

1901
02:21:21,431 --> 02:21:23,015
Come, then. I won the game.

1902
02:21:23,266 --> 02:21:24,933
You promised to show me the way out.

1903
02:21:25,643 --> 02:21:28,479
Did we say so, precious?

1904
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:31,648
Did we say so?

1905
02:21:34,903 --> 02:21:39,448
What has it got in its pocketses?

1906
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:42,367
That's no concern of yours.

1907
02:21:42,994 --> 02:21:44,995
You lost.

1908
02:21:45,246 --> 02:21:46,830
Lost?

1909
02:21:48,958 --> 02:21:50,000
Lost?

1910
02:21:52,003 --> 02:21:53,420
Lost?

1911
02:22:00,553 --> 02:22:01,720
Where is it?

1912
02:22:03,515 --> 02:22:04,181
Where is it?!

1913
02:22:05,433 --> 02:22:06,225
No!

1914
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:10,145
Where is it?!

1915
02:22:10,563 --> 02:22:11,230
No!

1916
02:22:11,481 --> 02:22:13,190
No!

1917
02:22:14,651 --> 02:22:16,235
Lost!

1918
02:22:16,486 --> 02:22:18,487
Curse us and splash us!

1919
02:22:19,155 --> 02:22:20,906
My precious...

1920
02:22:21,157 --> 02:22:22,032
is lost!

1921
02:22:24,452 --> 02:22:25,327
What have you lost?

1922
02:22:25,578 --> 02:22:28,872
Mustn't ask us! Not its business!

1923
02:22:29,123 --> 02:22:31,667
No! Gollum!

1924
02:22:31,918 --> 02:22:33,669
Gollum!

1925
02:22:46,349 --> 02:22:49,851
What has it got...

1926
02:22:50,103 --> 02:22:52,729
in its nasty...

1927
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:55,691
little pocketses?

1928
02:23:05,702 --> 02:23:07,703
He stole it.

1929
02:23:09,664 --> 02:23:11,707
He stole it!

1930
02:23:15,295 --> 02:23:15,961
He stole it!

1931
02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:24,219
# Bones will be shattered #

1932
02:23:24,470 --> 02:23:25,721
# Necks will be wrung #

1933
02:23:25,972 --> 02:23:27,855
# You'll be beaten and battered #

1934
02:23:27,857 --> 02:23:29,474
# From racks you'll be hung #

1935
02:23:29,726 --> 02:23:31,292
# You will die down here #

1936
02:23:31,644 --> 02:23:33,854
# And never be found #

1937
02:23:34,105 --> 02:23:35,606
# Down in the deep of Goblin-town #

1938
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,233
# Of Goblin-town #

1939
02:23:41,154 --> 02:23:42,613
I know that sword!

1940
02:23:43,114 --> 02:23:45,115
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

1941
02:23:45,742 --> 02:23:46,908
The Biter!

1942
02:23:48,161 --> 02:23:49,453
The blade that sliced...

1943
02:23:49,704 --> 02:23:51,538
a thousand necks! Slash them!

1944
02:23:52,749 --> 02:23:54,791
Beat them! Kill them!

1945
02:23:55,043 --> 02:23:56,668
Kill them all!

1946
02:23:56,919 --> 02:23:58,503
Cut off his head!

1947
02:24:28,618 --> 02:24:30,827
Take up arms.

1948
02:24:31,496 --> 02:24:32,788
Fight.

1949
02:24:34,123 --> 02:24:35,332
Fight!

1950
02:24:42,799 --> 02:24:45,175
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!

1951
02:24:45,802 --> 02:24:47,594
Bright as daylight!

1952
02:24:57,021 --> 02:24:58,313
Thorin!

1953
02:25:11,744 --> 02:25:12,911
Follow me.

1954
02:25:13,246 --> 02:25:13,912
Quick!

1955
02:25:17,208 --> 02:25:18,417
Run!

1956
02:25:27,051 --> 02:25:29,177
Give it to us!

1957
02:25:48,489 --> 02:25:49,656
It's...

1958
02:25:49,907 --> 02:25:51,366
ours.

1959
02:25:51,617 --> 02:25:53,368
It's ours!

1960
02:26:18,811 --> 02:26:20,979
Thief!

1961
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:25,233
Baggins!

1962
02:26:31,741 --> 02:26:32,908
Quickly!

1963
02:26:34,911 --> 02:26:35,827
Faster!

1964
02:26:46,672 --> 02:26:47,631
Post!

1965
02:26:50,635 --> 02:26:51,718
Charge!

1966
02:27:38,641 --> 02:27:39,307
Cut the ropes!

1967
02:28:03,207 --> 02:28:04,374
Come on, quickly!

1968
02:28:04,625 --> 02:28:06,626
- Come on, move!  - Bombur!

1969
02:28:12,967 --> 02:28:15,010
Go, go, go!

1970
02:28:18,514 --> 02:28:19,931
Jump!

1971
02:28:25,688 --> 02:28:26,479
Jump, lad!

1972
02:28:47,501 --> 02:28:48,251
Come on!

1973
02:28:51,130 --> 02:28:52,505
Push!

1974
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:12,984
Come on!

1975
02:29:18,574 --> 02:29:19,407
Come on!

1976
02:29:26,082 --> 02:29:27,040
Watch your backs!

1977
02:29:27,291 --> 02:29:29,834
You thought you could escape me.

1978
02:29:33,464 --> 02:29:35,924
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1979
02:29:44,392 --> 02:29:45,475
That'll do it.

1980
02:30:20,886 --> 02:30:23,388
Well, that could have been worse.

1981
02:30:24,056 --> 02:30:24,848
Haver!

1982
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,435
You've got to be joking!

1983
02:30:34,358 --> 02:30:35,025
Gandalf!

1984
02:30:40,406 --> 02:30:42,574
There's too many. We can't fight them.

1985
02:30:42,825 --> 02:30:44,826
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

1986
02:30:45,077 --> 02:30:46,244
Come on!

1987
02:30:46,495 --> 02:30:47,495
Here! On your feet.

1988
02:30:50,583 --> 02:30:52,751
- Balin.  - Come on!

1989
02:30:54,628 --> 02:30:55,962
Wait!

1990
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:59,049
My precious. Wait!

1991
02:30:59,884 --> 02:31:02,469
Gollum, gollum!

1992
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:09,100
Quick, quick!

1993
02:31:11,103 --> 02:31:12,103
This way.

1994
02:31:14,899 --> 02:31:18,026
- Come on.  - Come on, come on. Quickly.

1995
02:31:20,654 --> 02:31:22,363
Right, good!

1996
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:50,785
Baggins!

1997
02:32:52,121 --> 02:32:54,080
Thief!

1998
02:32:54,957 --> 02:32:59,460
Curse it and crush it! We hates it forever!

1999
02:33:12,808 --> 02:33:15,268
Five, six, seven, eight.

2000
02:33:15,728 --> 02:33:17,937
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

2001
02:33:18,189 --> 02:33:20,648
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

2002
02:33:20,983 --> 02:33:24,152
And Bombur. That makes 13.

2003
02:33:24,904 --> 02:33:26,196
Where's Bilbo?

2004
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:29,073
Where is our Hobbit?

2005
02:33:30,201 --> 02:33:31,743
Where is our Hobbit?

2006
02:33:33,245 --> 02:33:34,162
Curse that Halfling!

2007
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:36,122
Now he's lost?

2008
02:33:36,373 --> 02:33:37,707
I thought he was with Dori!

2009
02:33:38,542 --> 02:33:39,542
Don't blame me!

2010
02:33:39,793 --> 02:33:40,877
Where did you last see him?

2011
02:33:41,128 --> 02:33:41,794
I think I saw him...

2012
02:33:42,046 --> 02:33:42,754
slip away...

2013
02:33:43,005 --> 02:33:43,713
when they first collared us.

2014
02:33:43,964 --> 02:33:45,340
And what happened, exactly?

2015
02:33:45,591 --> 02:33:47,842
- Tell me!  - I'll tell you what happened.

2016
02:33:48,093 --> 02:33:49,677
Master Baggins saw his chance...

2017
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:50,845
and he took it.

2018
02:33:51,722 --> 02:33:54,224
He has thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

2019
02:33:54,642 --> 02:33:57,268
since first he stepped out of his door.

2020
02:33:57,519 --> 02:33:59,812
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

2021
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:02,065
He is long gone.

2022
02:34:14,245 --> 02:34:14,953
No.

2023
02:34:16,247 --> 02:34:16,913
He isn't.

2024
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:22,460
Bilbo Baggins.

2025
02:34:23,045 --> 02:34:24,170
I have never been so glad...

2026
02:34:24,421 --> 02:34:26,005
to see anyone in my life.

2027
02:34:28,008 --> 02:34:28,675
Bilbo.

2028
02:34:29,176 --> 02:34:29,884
We'd given you up.

2029
02:34:30,135 --> 02:34:32,053
How on earth did you get past the Goblins?

2030
02:34:32,304 --> 02:34:33,846
How, indeed.

2031
02:34:43,023 --> 02:34:45,984
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

2032
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:47,986
It matters.

2033
02:34:48,612 --> 02:34:49,946
I want to know.

2034
02:34:52,157 --> 02:34:53,866
Why did you come back?

2035
02:34:57,204 --> 02:35:00,290
Look, I know you doubt me. I know you always have.

2036
02:35:02,501 --> 02:35:04,585
And you're right. I often think of Bag-end.

2037
02:35:05,379 --> 02:35:07,213
I miss my books.

2038
02:35:08,173 --> 02:35:10,717
And my armchair and my garden.

2039
02:35:11,969 --> 02:35:13,303
See, that's where I belong.

2040
02:35:14,013 --> 02:35:15,722
That's home.

2041
02:35:17,474 --> 02:35:19,559
And that's why I came back. Because...

2042
02:35:21,895 --> 02:35:24,772
you don't have one. A home.

2043
02:35:25,441 --> 02:35:27,025
It was taken from you.

2044
02:35:30,112 --> 02:35:32,655
But I will help you take it back if I can.

2045
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:57,013


2046
02:35:57,623 --> 02:36:00,443


2047
02:36:06,148 --> 02:36:07,565
Out of the frying pan.

2048
02:36:07,816 --> 02:36:10,109
And into the fire. Run.

2049
02:36:10,444 --> 02:36:11,527
Run!

2050
02:36:27,586 --> 02:36:28,252
Go!

2051
02:36:56,156 --> 02:36:56,823
Up into the trees!

2052
02:36:57,074 --> 02:36:58,032
All of you!

2053
02:36:58,283 --> 02:36:59,534
Climb! Bilbo, climb!

2054
02:37:00,244 --> 02:37:00,910
Quickly!

2055
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:12,672
They're coming!

2056
02:37:51,211 --> 02:37:52,879
- Hang on!  - Hold on, brothers!

2057
02:38:14,359 --> 02:38:15,818
Azog.

2058
02:38:21,315 --> 02:38:24,683


2059
02:38:25,315 --> 02:38:27,983


2060
02:38:31,315 --> 02:38:37,283


2061
02:38:37,515 --> 02:38:42,383


2062
02:38:42,513 --> 02:38:44,305
It cannot be.

2063
02:38:51,315 --> 02:38:53,483


2064
02:38:54,478 --> 02:38:55,983


2065
02:39:23,278 --> 02:39:25,883


2066
02:39:37,818 --> 02:39:39,235
It's going!

2067
02:40:28,827 --> 02:40:30,077
Fili!

2068
02:40:54,686 --> 02:40:55,686
Yeah!

2069
02:41:04,946 --> 02:41:06,113
No!

2070
02:41:12,913 --> 02:41:13,579
Oh, no.

2071
02:41:19,169 --> 02:41:20,628
Mr. Gandalf!

2072
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:27,551
Oh, no, Dori!

2073
02:42:38,498 --> 02:42:39,165
Help!

2074
02:42:57,893 --> 02:42:59,101
No!

2075
02:43:11,782 --> 02:43:13,574
Thorin! No!

2076
02:43:32,037 --> 02:43:36,486


2077
02:44:25,037 --> 02:44:27,086


2078
02:46:12,587 --> 02:46:13,253
Look.

2079
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:03,262
Thorin!

2080
02:48:18,338 --> 02:48:19,922
Thorin!

2081
02:48:23,676 --> 02:48:24,718
Thorin.

2082
02:48:42,278 --> 02:48:43,362
The Halfling?

2083
02:48:44,447 --> 02:48:46,490
It's all right.

2084
02:48:46,908 --> 02:48:47,866
Bilbo is here.

2085
02:48:48,118 --> 02:48:50,077
He's quite safe.

2086
02:49:00,004 --> 02:49:01,046
You!

2087
02:49:05,009 --> 02:49:06,051
What were you doing?

2088
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:07,761
You nearly got...

2089
02:49:08,012 --> 02:49:09,179
yourself killed!

2090
02:49:11,224 --> 02:49:11,974
Did I not say...

2091
02:49:12,225 --> 02:49:14,143
that you would be a burden?

2092
02:49:14,978 --> 02:49:17,437
That you would not survive in the Wild?

2093
02:49:18,606 --> 02:49:20,524
That you had no place amongst us?

2094
02:49:26,114 --> 02:49:28,323
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

2095
02:49:42,172 --> 02:49:43,714
I am sorry I doubted you.

2096
02:49:43,965 --> 02:49:46,175
No, I would have doubted me too.

2097
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:48,010
I'm not a hero...

2098
02:49:48,261 --> 02:49:49,720
or a warrior.

2099
02:49:51,681 --> 02:49:52,347
Not even...

2100
02:49:52,599 --> 02:49:53,849
a burglar.

2101
02:50:13,286 --> 02:50:15,537
Is that what I think it is?

2102
02:50:30,762 --> 02:50:31,803
Erebor...

2103
02:50:33,431 --> 02:50:34,973
the Lonely Mountain...

2104
02:50:35,225 --> 02:50:37,184
the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms...

2105
02:50:37,435 --> 02:50:39,895
of Middle-earth.

2106
02:50:42,607 --> 02:50:44,399
Our home.

2107
02:50:48,863 --> 02:50:49,529
A raven!

2108
02:50:50,448 --> 02:50:51,240
The birds...

2109
02:50:51,491 --> 02:50:53,492
are returning to the mountain.

2110
02:50:56,913 --> 02:50:58,664
That, my dear Oin...

2111
02:50:58,915 --> 02:51:00,666
is a thrush.

2112
02:51:01,918 --> 02:51:04,002
But we'll take it as a sign.

2113
02:51:04,254 --> 02:51:05,254
A good omen.

2114
02:51:05,505 --> 02:51:07,005
You're right.

2115
02:51:07,715 --> 02:51:10,509
I do believe the worst is behind us.

2116
02:51:12,817 --> 02:51:20,551


2117
02:51:20,740 --> 02:51:34,567


2118
02:51:34,706 --> 02:51:48,677


2119
02:53:03,370 --> 02:53:10,049
# Far over the misty mountains rise #

2120
02:53:11,378 --> 02:53:17,602
# Leave us standing upon the height #

2121
02:53:19,177 --> 02:53:26,102
# What was before, we'll see once more #

2122
02:53:27,269 --> 02:53:32,491
# Is our kingdom a distant light #

2123
02:53:34,526 --> 02:53:39,874
# Fiery mountain beneath the moon #

2124
02:53:41,325 --> 02:53:47,879
# The words unspoken, we'll be there soon #

2125
02:53:49,458 --> 02:53:56,511
# For home, a song that echoes on #

2126
02:53:57,507 --> 02:54:02,855
# And all who find us will know the tune #

2127
02:54:06,141 --> 02:54:09,395
# Some folk we never forget #

2128
02:54:10,187 --> 02:54:13,532
# Some kind we never forgive #

2129
02:54:14,358 --> 02:54:17,487
# Haven't seen the back of us yet #

2130
02:54:18,445 --> 02:54:21,699
# We'll fight as long as we live #

2131
02:54:22,449 --> 02:54:25,623
# All eyes on the hidden door #

2132
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:29,715
# To the Lonely Mountain borne #

2133
02:54:30,499 --> 02:54:33,673
# We'll ride in the gathering storm #

2134
02:54:34,336 --> 02:54:39,342
# Until we get our long-forgotten gold #

2135
02:54:41,301 --> 02:54:47,149
# We lay under the misty mountains cold #

2136
02:54:49,017 --> 02:54:55,157
# In slumbers deep and dreams of gold #

2137
02:54:56,983 --> 02:55:04,041
# We must awake, our lives to make #

2138
02:55:05,075 --> 02:55:10,081
# And in the darkness a torch we hold #

2139
02:55:12,165 --> 02:55:17,513
# From long ago when lanterns burned #

2140
02:55:19,214 --> 02:55:25,516
# Until this day our hearts have yearned #

2141
02:55:27,222 --> 02:55:34,605
# Her fate unknown, the Arkenstone #

2142
02:55:35,480 --> 02:55:41,570
# What was stolen must be returned #

2143
02:55:57,502 --> 02:56:05,223
# We must awake and make the day #

2144
02:56:05,510 --> 02:56:11,483
# To find a song for heart and soul #

2145
02:56:15,145 --> 02:56:18,445
# Some folk we never forget #

2146
02:56:19,232 --> 02:56:22,486
# Some kind we never forgive #

2147
02:56:23,403 --> 02:56:26,498
# Haven't seen the end of it yet #

2148
02:56:27,574 --> 02:56:30,623
# We'll fight as long as we live #

2149
02:56:31,453 --> 02:56:34,832
# All eyes on the hidden door #

2150
02:56:35,499 --> 02:56:38,924
# To the Lonely Mountain borne #

2151
02:56:39,586 --> 02:56:42,806
# We'll ride in the gathering storm #

2152
02:56:43,590 --> 02:56:48,346
# Till we get our long-forgotten gold #

2153
02:56:50,096 --> 02:56:57,526
# Far away from misty mountains cold #
