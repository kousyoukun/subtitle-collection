1
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,841
霍比特人

2
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,143
亲爱的弗罗多
OLD BILBO (V.O.): My dear Frodo.

3
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,371
你曾经问过我是否我把
You asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my...

4
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:18,949
自己的冒险故事全告诉你了
adventures.

5
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:23,082
我可以诚实地说尽管我说了真相
And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth...

6
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,000
但我没把故事说完整
I may not have told you all of it.

7
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:36,766
现在我老了，弗罗多
I am old now Frodo.

8
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:41,238
我不再是以前那个霍比特人了
I'm not the same hobbit I once was.

9
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:48,651
我想是时候让你知道
I think it is time for you to know...

10
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:51,689
事情的全貌了
what really happened.

11
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,682
那是很久以前的事
It began long ago.

12
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:00,348
发生在东方国度之外的土地上
In a land far away to the East.

13
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:06,490
一个你现在不再可能找到的地方
The like of which you will not find in the world today.

14
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,566
那儿有个河谷镇
There was the city of Dale.

15
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:24,240
它的集市远近闻名，那儿满是精美的物品
Its market's known far and wide, full of the bounties of fine and vail,

16
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,798
一片安宁，繁荣的景象
peaceful and prosperous.

17
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:36,130
这座城位于中土世界最伟大的王国
For this city laid before the doors of the greatest kingdom in Middle- earth...

18
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,910
伊鲁柏前
Erebor.

19
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:43,616
那是山下国王索尔的要塞
Stronghold of Thrór, king under the mountain.

20
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,885
他是最伟大的矮人国王
The mightiest of the dwarf lords.

21
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:52,832
索尔从不担心自己的统治 从不怀疑王国能否延续
Thrór ruled with utter surety, never doubting his house would endure,

22
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:56,541
因为王位的继承稳稳地掌握在
for his line lay secure in the lives of his son...

23
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,885
他的儿子和孙子手中
and grandson.

24
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,619
弗罗多，
Ah, Frodo. 

25
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:06,093
伊鲁柏隐藏在深深的大山里
Erebor Built deep within the mountain itself,

26
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,727
这座要塞城的美是一个传奇
the beauty of this fortress city was a legend.

27
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:15,638
它的财富在于土地 在于岩石里开凿出的珍贵宝石
Its wealth lay in the earth, in precious gems humed from rock,

28
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:21,557
还有像河一样流淌于岩石缝里的金子
and in great seams of gold running like rivers through stone.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,775
矮人的技能无与伦比
The skill of the dwarves was unequaled.

30
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,152
能用钻石，绿宝石，红宝石和蓝宝石
Fashioning object of great beauty,

31
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:35,066
制作精美物品
out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.

32
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,859
他们越挖越深，挖到深处
Ever they delved deeper down into the dark,

33
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,004
就在那里发现了它
and that is where they found it.

34
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,947
大山之心
The heart of the mountain...

35
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:55,623
阿肯宝石
The Arkenstone.

36
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,860
索尔叫它“国王宝石”
Thrór named it the king's jewel.

37
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:03,733
把它作为自己神圣统治权的象征
He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine.

38
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:10,723
所有人都要来朝拜 甚至包括精灵国王瑟兰督伊
All would pay homage to him. Even the great Elven king, Thranduil.

39
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:16,145
不过安宁和富庶的日子不再延续了
But the years of peace and plenty were not to last.

40
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:20,488
慢慢地白天变得阴沉
Slowly the days turned sour,

41
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:23,900
夜晚总是提心吊胆
and the watchful nights closed in.

42
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:34,577
索尔对金子的爱越发疯狂
Thrór's love of gold had grown too fierce...

43
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:40,410
内心开始滋生病态
A sickness had begun to grow within him.

44
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:44,337
那是思想的病变
It was a sickness of the mind.

45
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,773
而病态滋生的地方
And where sickness thrives...

46
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,398
就有恶事相随
bad things will follow.

47
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:07,108
最先他们听到了来自北方的飓风般的噪音
The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane, coming down from the North.

48
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:13,100
山上的松树在干热的风中吱嘎响着断裂了
The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked in the hot dry wind.

49
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,745
巴林，放警报
THORIN: Balin, sound the alarm.

50
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,935
叫守卫出来，立马行动！
Call out the guards, do it now!

51
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:25,482
怎么了？
BALIN: What is it?

52
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,858
龙来了
Dragon.

53
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,284
龙来了！
DRAGON!

54
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,980
那是北方来的火龙
OLD BILBO (V.O.): He was a Firedrake from the North.

55
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,648
斯矛戈来了
Smaug... had come!

56
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:16,829
那日死伤无数
Such wanton death was dealt that day,

57
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,407
因为城里的人都敌不过斯矛戈
for this city of men was nothing to Smaug.

58
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,993
他盯上了另一件宝物
His eye was set on another price.

59
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:35,603
龙对金子也有邪恶而强烈的欲望
For dragons covet gold... with a dark and fierce desire.

60
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:09,611
不！
NO!

61
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:21,017
伊鲁柏灭亡了
Erebor... was lost.

62
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:30,688
只要恶龙还活着他就会拼命守护掠夺物
For a dragon will guard his plunder as long as he lives.

63
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,242
逃命吧！
Run for your lives!

64
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,148
救救我们！
Help us!

65
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:01,562
瑟兰督伊不会冒灭族之险与恶龙对抗
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the lawth of the dragon.

66
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:05,678
那天精灵没有帮忙
No help came from the Elves that day.

67
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:09,006
从那之后再也没有
Nor any day since.

68
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:16,147
丢失了家园的伊鲁柏矮人在荒野里游荡
Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness.

69
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,002
曾经伟大的矮人变得低贱了
The once mighty people brought low.

70
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:25,413
年轻的矮人王子干自己能找到的活儿
The young dwarf prince took work where he could find it,

71
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,012
在人类村落里劳作
laboring in the villages of men.

72
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,553
但他始终记得
But always, he remembered...

73
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:36,710
月亮下冒烟的大山 如同火炬般烧得通红的树
the mountain smoke beneath the moon, the trees like torches blazing bright,

74
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:42,919
恶龙在空中喷火，城池烧成灰烬
where he had seen dragon fire in the sky, and a city turn to ash.

75
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:49,256
他从没原谅过也从没忘记那些事
And he never forgave... and he never forgot.

76
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,669
亲爱的弗罗多，我就是这时掺和进去的
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.

77
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:02,348
算是因为机遇和巫师的意愿
For quite by chance, and the will of a wizard,

78
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:06,524
命运决定我成为这个传说的一部分
fate decided I would become part of this tale.

79
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:11,915
故事开始于，就像你期望的那样……
It began... well, it began as you might expect.

80
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:18,289
地上的一个洞里，那里住着个霍比特人
In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.

81
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,314
不是个肮脏，恶心 满是虫子和软泥臭味的湿洞
Not a nasty, dirty wet hole full of worms and oozy smells.

82
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,775
这是霍比特人的家
This was a hobbit home.

83
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:32,955
那意味着好食物，温暖的
And that means good food, a warm house...

84
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,468
舒适的家
and all the comforts of home.

85
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,733
谢谢
OLD BILBO: Thank you.

86
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,136
这是什么？
FRODO: What's this?

87
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:18,744
这是隐私，把你黏糊糊的爪子拿开！
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off!

88
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:21,859
还没准备好呢
It's not ready yet.

89
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:23,958
准备好什么？
Not ready for what?

90
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,521
给人看
Reading.

91
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,651
这些到底是什么？
OLD BILBO: What on earth are these?

92
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,672
聚会邀请的回复
FRODO: Replies to the party invitations.

93
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,403
天哪！
Good gracious.

94
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,436
是今天吗？
Is it today?

95
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:41,405
他们都说会来，除了萨克维尔巴金斯家
They all say they're coming, except for the Sackville- Bagginses,

96
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,717
他们要你亲自去请
who're demanding you ask them in person.

97
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,929
真的吗？除非我死了
OLD BILBO: Are they, indeed. Over my dead body.

98
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,999
他们或许觉得这可以接受
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.

99
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:51,614
他们似乎觉得你的地道里充满金子
They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.

100
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:55,107
只是一小箱，压根儿满不上来
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

101
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:58,300
还有巨怪的臭味
And it still smells of troll.

102
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,054
你到底在干什么？
What on earth are you doing?

103
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,416
做防备！
Taking precautions!

104
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,700
有一回我逮到她偷银器
You know I caught her making off with the silverware once.

105
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,841
谁？
FRODO: Who?

106
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,460
罗贝拉・萨克维尔巴金斯
OLD BILBO: Lobelia Sackville- Baggins.

107
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:16,171
她把我的勺子全装在口袋里
She had all my spoons stuffed in her pockets.

108
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,057
可怕的女人
Dreadful woman.

109
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,979
盯紧她，等我……
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I'm...

110
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,393
等我……
When I'm... when...

111
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,135
等你什么？
When you're... what?

112
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:34,545
没什么，没什么
It's nothing... nothing.

113
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,167
有些人开始琢磨你
FRODO: You know, some people are beginning to wonder about you.

114
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,216
他们觉得你变得很奇怪
They think you're becoming odd.

115
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,122
奇怪？
C Odd? C Hmm...

116
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,450
不爱交际
Unsociable.

117
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,106
我不爱交际？胡扯
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

118
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,669
做个好孩子，把这个钉在大门上
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

119
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:06,550
你觉得他会来吗？
Do you think he will come?

120
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,530
谁？
Who?

121
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:08,733
甘道夫
Gandalf.

122
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:12,511
他不会错过放巫师烟花的机会的
Oh, he wouldn't miss a chance to let off his wiz poppers.

123
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,040
他会上演一出好戏的，等着吧
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

124
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:16,094
那么我走了
FRODO: Right then. I am off. .

125
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:17,110
去哪儿？
FRODO: Right then. I am off. C Off to where?

126
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,499
东域森林，我要去给他惊喜
FRODO: Eastfarthing woods. I'm going to surprise him.

127
00:12:19,618 --> 00:12:22,877
去吧，你不会愿意迟到的
OLD BILBO: Well go on then. You don't want to be late.

128
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:30,123
他不批准迟到
OLD BILBO: He doesn't approve being late.

129
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:33,285
我也不
Not that I ever was.

130
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,614
那些日子，我总是很准时
In those days, I was always on time.

131
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,191
我受人尊敬
I was entirely respectable...

132
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:44,584
从没发生过
and nothing unexpected...

133
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:47,756
意外的事
ever happened.

134
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:54,683
意外旅程
AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY

135
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,683
（60年前）

136
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:14,268
- 早上好 - 什么意思？
C Good morning. C What do you mean?

137
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:15,699
你是在向我问好
Do you mean to wish me a good morning,

138
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,895
还是想说不论我是否喜欢，这个早上都还不错？
or do you mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not?

139
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:24,421
或者是想说在这个特别的早上你感觉不错？
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning...

140
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:28,981
或者你只是在说这是个值得过的早上？
or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on?

141
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,880
我想全都有
All of them at once, I suppose.

142
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:40,846
要我帮忙吗？
Can I help you?

143
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,815
看看再说
It remains to be seen.

144
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:48,835
我在找人和我一起冒险
I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

145
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,509
冒险？
An adventure?

146
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,082
不，我不认为布理以西的任何人
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree,

147
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,546
会对冒险有兴趣
who'd have much interest in adventures.

148
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:05,352
那是恶心，烦人，不舒服的事
Nasty, disturbing... uncomfortable things.

149
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,978
还会让你来不及吃晚餐
Make you late for dinner!

150
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,727
早上好！
Good morning!

151
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:22,961
真没想到竟然让贝拉多娜・图克的儿子
To think that I should have lived to be good- morninged by Belladonna Took's son,

152
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,467
把我当成门口卖扣子的小贩来问早！
as if I was selling buttons at the door!

153
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:27,702
再说一遍？
Beg your pardon?

154
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,832
你变了，并非完全变好，比尔博・巴金斯
You've changed, and not entirely for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

155
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:33,090
抱歉，我认识你吗？
I'm sorry, do I know you?

156
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,274
你或许记得我的名字 只是不记得我就是那个人
Would you know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it,

157
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,155
我是甘道夫
I'm Gandalf...

158
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,217
甘道夫意味着……
and Gandalf means...

159
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:43,663
我！
me!

160
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:48,675
就是那个造美丽烟花的游荡巫师甘道夫？
Not Gandalf, the wandering wizard who made such excellent fireworks,

161
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,871
老图克在仲夏节前夜都会放你的烟花！
Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve!

162
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:55,502
我不知道你还在做买卖
I had no idea you were still in business.

163
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,451
我还能做什么？
And where else should I be?

164
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,850
呃……
Well...

165
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:05,898
我很高兴你记起了我的一些事
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember something about me...

166
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,742
即便只是我的烟花
even if it's only my fireworks.

167
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,232
那么就决定了
So that's decided.

168
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,419
这对你来说很不错
It will be very good for you...

169
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,167
对我来说也很有趣，我去通知其他人
and most amusing for me. I shall inform the others.

170
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,475
通知谁，什么，不，不，不，等等
Inform the who- what- no, no. No, wait.

171
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:28,043
我们这儿不要冒险，谢谢，不是今天，不是……
We do not want any adventures here, thank you- not today, not...

172
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:32,989
我建议你去山那边或湖那边试试
I suggest you try over the hill or... across the water.

173
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,035
早上好

Which way, laddie?

就在这下面吗？
Is it down here?

什么在什么下边？
Is it down here? C Is- Is what? Down where?

184
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:25,888
晚餐，他说会有晚餐，还很丰盛
Supper. He said there'd be food. Lots of it.

185
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:29,418
他……他说？谁说的？
He- he said? Who said?

很棒的菜，还有吗？
Very good dish. Any more?

00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:46,405
什么？噢，有，有

请便
Help yourself.

只不过是，呃……
It's just that, hum...

晚上好
Good evening.

195
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:18,859
对，对，是个好天
Yes, yes it is.

196
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,497
不过我想晚些或许会下雨
Though I thing it might rain later.

197
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,695
我迟到了吗？
Am I late?

198
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,966
迟到……什么？
Late... for what?

天哪！
By my beard!

203
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:37,642
你比上回我们见面时还矮还壮
You are shorter and wider than last we met.

204
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:39,706
壮了，没矮
Wider, not shorter.

205
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,365
足以扛住我们两人合力
Sharp enough for both of us.

206
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,116
[Balin laughing]

对不起，抱歉，我不想插话
Uh... Excuse me. Sorry. I hate to interrupt.

209
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:58,529
但问题是我不太确定你们走对门了
Uh, but the thing is I'm not entirely sure you're in the right house.

210
00:18:58,678 --> 00:18:59,787
你吃了没？
BALIN: Have you eaten?

211
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,668
不是说我不好客
It- It's not that I don't like visitors.

212
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:05,175
我和其他霍比特人一样好客
I like visitors as much as the next hobbit.

213
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,468
但我希望在他们来……拜访之前 我就认识他们了……
But I do like to know them before they come... visiting...

C DWALIN: What's this? C BALIN: I don't know,

215
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:11,356
我想是奶酪
BALIN: I just thought it a cheese,

216
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,424
- 问题是…… - 变蓝了
C BILBO: The thing is- C BALIN: Gone blue.

C DWALIN: It's riddled, but mold. C BILBO: the thing is,

218

我不……我不知道怎么开始……完全不懂
BILBO: I don't- I don't know how to begin. Not in the slightest.

219
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:22,613
我不想太直接，但我…… 我得说自己的想法，抱歉
BILBO: I don't mean to be blunt, but I- but I had to speak my mind. I'm sorry.

220
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,811

上面都是洞！
BOFUR: But it's full of holes!

289

就该长成这样，这是钩针编织的
BILBO: It's supposed to look like that, it's crochet.

290

怎么回事？
What's the matter?

I am surrounded by dwarves. What they're doing here?

295
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,181
他们在聚会……一旦你习惯了他们
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering... once you get used to 'em.

Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected. Do we sit back...

看着别人拿走属于我们的东西吗？
while others claim what is rightfully ours?

399

你怎么拿到这个？
THORIN: How came you by this...?

405
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:26,424
这是索恩给你父亲，再传给我保管的
GANDALF: It was given to me by your father... by Thráin... for safekeeping.

406
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,596
现在是你的了
It is yours now.

407
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:41,137
如果有钥匙，那肯定有门！
KILI: If there is a key... there must be a door!

408
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:45,620
这些如尼文写着 通往低层大厅的一条隐蔽通道
These runes speak of a hidden passage to the lower halls.

409
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:48,444
还有一个进入办法
There's another way in.

410
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:52,287
如果我们能找到的话 但矮人门关闭时是隐形的
Well, if we can find it, but dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

411
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,815
答案就藏在这张地图上
The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map,

412
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,740
我没能力找到它
and I do not have the skill to find it, but...

413
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:04,026
但在中土，有人能
there are others in Middle- earth who can.

414
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:08,482
我设想的这个任务要求极大的隐蔽性
The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth,

415
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,055
也不缺少勇气
and no small amount of courage.

416
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,769
但如果我们机灵，谨慎，我相信能成功
But if we're careful and clever, I believe that it can be done.

417
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:18,564
所以我们需要小偷
ORI: That's why we need a burglar.

418
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:21,900
还是个好小偷，小偷专家，我想是
BILBO: Hmm. And a good one too. An expert, I would imagine.

419
00:30:22,377 --> 00:30:24,031
你是吗？
GLOIN: And are you?

420
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,517
我是什么？
BILBO: Am I what?

421
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:31,021
他说他是专家！
OIN: He said he's an expert!

422
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:34,597
我？不，不，不，我，我不是小偷
Me? No. No no no no. I-  I'm not a burglar.

423
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:36,714
我生命里从没偷过东西
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

424
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,564
我恐怕得赞成巴金斯先生
And I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr. Baggins.

425
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,158
他几乎不偷东西
He's hardly burglar material.

426
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:47,931
对，野外不适合既不能作战 也不会自我防护的温和的人
Aye, the wild is no place for gentle folk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

427
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,398
[All dwarves speak heatedly]

428
00:30:55,505 --> 00:31:01,854
够了！如果我说 比尔博・巴金斯是小偷，那么他就是
Enough! If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar, then a burglar he is.

429
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:05,555
霍比特人脚步很轻
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.

430
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,770
事实上，他们可以过而不为人所见
In fact, they can pass unseen by most if they choose...

431
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,888
虽然恶龙习惯了矮人的气味
and while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of a dwarf,

432
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,947
但霍比特人的气味他完全不懂
the scent of a hobbit is all about unknown to him,

433
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:18,726
这样我们有明显的优势
which gives us a distinct advantage.

434
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:22,324
你们叫我找到第十四名成员
You asked me to find the 14th member of this company,

435
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,261
我选择巴金斯先生
and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

436
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:27,070
他的能力远超过他的外在表现
There's a lot more into him than his appearances suggest.

437
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:30,721
他所能贡献的比你们任何人
And he's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know...

438
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:34,062
包括他自己，所知道的都多
including himself.

439
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,975
为此你们必须信任他
You must trust me on this.

440
00:31:44,306 --> 00:31:45,780
很好
Very well...

441
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:47,177
我们按你说的办
We'll do it your way. .

442
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:47,889
不，不
We'll do it your way. C BLIBO: No. No-

443
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:48,694
把契约给他
Give him your contract.

444
00:31:48,695 --> 00:31:49,655
- 我们加入 - 拜托
C BOFUR: We're in. C BILBO: Please.

445
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:50,277
我们准备好了
BOFUR: We're off!

446
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:53,408
都是寻常内容，总结下开支
It's just the usual: summary about the pocket expenses...

447
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:57,710
所需时间，报酬，葬礼安排等等
time required, remuneration, funeral arrangements, so forth.

448
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:00,209
葬礼安排？
Funeral arrangements?

449
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:03,931
Ooh...

450
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,463
我们不能保证他的安全
We cannot guarantee his safety.

451
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:09,025
理解
Understood.

452
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:12,015
他的命运我们不负责
We will not be responsible for his fate.

453
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:16,831
同意
Agreed.

454
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:20,016
总交付金额可达但不超过
“.. total's cash on delivery up to but not exceeding

455
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:24,107
总收益的十四分之一，看着挺公平
one fourteenth of total profit if any”. Seems fair.

456
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,152
所在队伍不负责由此带来的损伤
“The present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by or sustained

457
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,659
包括，但不局限于
as a consequence thereof, including, but not limited to...

458
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:33,841
撕伤
lacerations...

459
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,223
除脏？
evisceration?

460
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:40,338
火葬？
Incineration?

461
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:43,553
对，他会在眨眼间让你的肉从骨上熔化
Oh, aye, he’ll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye.

462
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,376
Hu...

463
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:49,694
你没事吧，伙计？
You alright, laddie? .

464
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:50,961
呃，没事，我……
You alright, laddie? C Huh? Yeah, I fe-

465
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,719
[Blows]

466
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,773
有点眩晕
Feel a bit faint.

467
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:56,424
想想带翅膀的火炉
Think furnace, with wings. .

468
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:58,235
嘿，我，我，我要点空气
Think furnace, with wings. C Hey, I- I- I need air.

469
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:03,310
一道亮光，灼热的痛，然后噗！你就只剩一堆灰了
BOFUR: Flash of light, searing pain, and puf! You’re nothing more than a pile of ash!

470
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:11,352
不
No-

471
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,530
很有用，波弗
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

472
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:16,700
我没事，只是……让我……安静地坐一会儿
I'll be alright. Just... let me... sit quietly for a moment.

473
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,714
你已经安静地坐很久了
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

474
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:21,731
告诉我
GANDALF: Tell me...

475
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:26,795
何时起桌巾和你母亲的盘子 变得对你如此重要了？
When did doilies... and your mother's dishes become so important to you?

476
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,791
我还记得那个总是在森林里 四处追寻精灵的小霍比特人
I remember a young hobbit who was always running off in search of Elves, in woods.

477
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,690
他会在外面呆到深夜
He would stay out late.

478
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,786
天黑后回家，拖着泥，树枝和萤火虫
Come home, after dark, trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

479
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:42,118
一个最喜欢探寻
A young hobbit who would've liked nothing better than to find out

480
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:44,926
夏尔边界之外的世界的小霍比特人
what was beyond the borders of the Shire.

481
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:49,495
世界不在你的书和地图里
The world is not in your books and maps.

482
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:52,860
它在外面
It's out there.

483
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,788
我不能就这么到外面瞎跑
I can't just go running off into the blue.

484
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:59,975
我是袋底洞的巴金斯一员
I am a Baggins... of Bagg End.

485
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,661
你也是图克家的人
You are also a Took.

486
00:34:04,313 --> 00:34:07,740
你知不知道你的曾曾曾祖叔吼牛图克
Did you know that your great great great great uncle, Bullroarer Took,

487
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:10,956
有多么高大，甚至能骑马？
was so large, he could ride a real horse?

488
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:12,920
- 知道 - 对，他能！
Yes, well he could!

489
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:16,082
在绿地战役中，他对战妖精军队
In the battle of Greenfields, he charged the goblin ranks

490
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:20,197
他猛挥棍棒，把妖精国王的头彻底抡下
he swung his club so hard, it knocked the goblin king's head clean off,

491
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,906
那头在空中飞了好几百码滚进兔子洞里
and it sailed a hundred yards through the air, and went down a rabbit hole.

492
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,758
这样，赢了那场战
And thus the battle as won...

493
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:29,805
也由此发明了高尔夫球运动
and the game of golf invented at the same times.

494
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:35,516
我相信你在瞎编
BILBO: I do believe you made that up.

495
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:39,453
好故事都值得修饰
GANDALF: Well, all good stories deserve embellishment.

496
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:44,673
你回来的时候就会有一两个自己的传奇了
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.

497
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,410
你能保证我回得来？
Can you promise that I will come back?

498
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:53,876
不能
No...

499
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:56,318
但如果你回来了……
And if you do...

500
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:58,900
你就不一样了
you'll not be the same.

501
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:02,983
我就是那么想的
That's what I thought.

502
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,535
抱歉，甘道夫，我不能签
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

503
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:10,301
你找错人了
You've got the wrong hobbit.

504
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:20,571
似乎我们没有小偷了
BALIN: It appears we have lost our burglar.

505
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,830
或许是最好的小偷
Probably for the best.

506
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:26,183
我们总是遇逆境
The odds were always against us.

507
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:29,378
说到底，我们是什么？
After all, what are we?

508
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:32,964
商人，矿工
Merchants, minors...

509
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:36,003
炉匠，玩具工
tinkers, toy makers.

510
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:39,232
完全不是造传奇的料
Hardly the stuff of legend.

511
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:41,780
我们中有几个战士
There are a few warriors amongst us.

512
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,568
老战士了
Old warriors.

513
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:49,388
我会带着这几个矮人统帅铁丘陵军队
THORIN: I would take each and every one of these dwarves over an army from the Iron Hills...

514
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,364
因为每当我召唤他们时，他们都能回应
for when I called upon them, they answered.

515
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:55,079
忠心
Loyalty...

516
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:56,548
荣誉
Honor...

517
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:58,274
热诚
A willing heart....

518
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:02,078
除此外，我别无所求
I can ask no more than that.

519
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,495
你没必要这样
You don't have to do this.

520
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:07,338
你可以选择
You have a choice.

521
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,846
你已经受到我们族人尊敬
You've done honorably by our people.

522
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,430
你在蓝山上为我们建造了新生活
Yоu hаvе bu?lt а nеw l?fе fоr u? ?n thе Βluе Μоuntа?n?...

523
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,915
安宁，富庶的生活
a life of peace and plenty.

524
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:24,167
完全胜过伊鲁柏金子价值的生活
A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor.

525
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:30,015
从祖父到父亲，这东西再传到我
From my grandfather to my father, this has come to me.

526
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:35,396
他们梦想着伊鲁柏矮人重得家园的那一天
They dreamt of the day when the dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

527
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:39,368
没有选择，巴林
There is no choice, Balin.

528
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,459
我没有选择
Not for me.

529
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:47,165
那么我们和你一道，伙计
BALIN: Then we are with you, laddie.

530
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:50,501
我们会看到成功的
We will see it done.

531
00:37:13,204 --> 00:37:21,204
?翻过远方寒冷的迷雾山脉
? Far over the misty mountains cold

532
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:29,847
?直至幽深古老的地窖山洞
? To dungeons deep and caverns old

533
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:39,177
?我们必须在破晓前出发
? We must away ere break of day

534
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:48,026
?去找寻久已忘去的金子
? To find our long forgotten gold

535
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:57,604
?高山上松树在怒吼
? The pines were roaring on the height

536
00:37:58,341 --> 00:38:06,341
?深夜里冷风在呻吟
? The winds were moaning in the night

GANDALF: What on earth are you doing here?

952
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,493
我在找你，甘道夫
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

953
01:12:35,595 --> 01:12:39,350
出事了，出大事了！
Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong!

954
01:12:39,447 --> 01:12:40,567
什么事？
Yes?

955
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,817
给我一分钟
RADAGAST: Just give me a minute, hm...

956
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,279
不
No...

957
01:12:49,315 --> 01:12:51,399
有个想法，可是忘了，是……
I had a thought and, now I've lost it, it was-

958
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,350
就在那儿，在舌尖！
it was was right there, on the tip of my tongue!

959
01:12:55,696 --> 01:12:58,373
噢，根本不是个想法！
Oh! It's not a thought at all!

960
01:12:58,889 --> 01:13:00,709
只是个……
It's just only a...

961
01:13:01,746 --> 01:13:02,964
竹节虫
stick insect.

962
01:13:07,236 --> 01:13:10,186
绿林病了，甘道夫
RADAGAST: The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

963
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:15,591
黑暗降临了，万物不再生长了
A darkness has fallen over it, nothing glows anymore.

964
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:18,120
至少好东西不再生长了
At least nothing good.

965
01:13:18,605 --> 01:13:21,105
空气满是腐烂臭味
The air is foul of decay,

966
01:13:21,683 --> 01:13:23,344
更糟的是网
but worse are the webs.

967
01:13:23,478 --> 01:13:25,319
网？什么意思？
GANDALF: Webs? What do you mean?

968
01:13:25,677 --> 01:13:29,604
蜘蛛，甘道夫，大蜘蛛
RADAGAST: Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones.

969
01:13:29,799 --> 01:13:33,874
像是……安格利昂的卵 不然我就不是巫师（安格利昂：远古巨蜘蛛）
Some kind of spawn of... Ungoliant, or I'm not a wizard.

970
01:13:34,473 --> 01:13:36,377
我跟踪它们
I followed their trail.

971
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,353
它们来自多尔哥多
They came from... Dol Guldur.

972
01:13:42,269 --> 01:13:43,669
多尔哥多？
GANDALF: Dol Guldur?

973
01:13:44,613 --> 01:13:47,525
但古堡荒废了
But the old fortress is abandoned.

974
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:49,910
不，甘道夫
No, Gandalf.

975
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:53,234
没有
It is not.

976
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:04,874
那儿住着黑暗势力
RADAGAST (CONT'D): A dark power dwells in there...

977
01:14:05,117 --> 01:14:08,669
我从没遇到过的恶势力
such as I have never felt before.

978
01:14:10,191 --> 01:14:14,324
那是远古光环的影子
It is the shadow of an ancient aura.

979
01:14:20,505 --> 01:14:26,151
能够唤起亡灵的影子
One that can summon the spirits of the dead.

980
01:14:42,982 --> 01:14:44,933
我看见他了，甘道夫
I saw him, Gandalf.

981
01:14:45,598 --> 01:14:47,838
在黑暗里
From out of the darkness...

982
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:52,327
死灵法师来了
the Necromancer has come!

983
01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:21,067
抱歉
Sorry.

984
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,405
来点老托比
GANDALF: Try a little old Toby.

985
01:15:24,077 --> 01:15:25,481
能帮你冷静冷静
It'll help setting your nerves.

986
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,706
再吐出来
Then out.

987
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:40,469
死灵法师
Now... the Necromancer.

988
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:42,212
你确定？
Are you sure?

989
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:59,769
那不是来自……
RADAGAST: That is not... from the world...

990
01:15:59,965 --> 01:16:02,371
活人世界的
of the living.

991
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,111
[Howlings]

992
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,233
是狼吗？有……那儿有狼吗？
Was that a wolf? Are there- are there wolves out there?

993
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:11,619
狼？
Wolves?

994
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,567
不，那不是狼
No, that is not a wolf.

995
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,842
[Growls]

996
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:29,129
座狼探兵！
THORIN: Warg scouts!

997
01:16:29,448 --> 01:16:31,471
意味着半兽人群不远了
Which means an orc pack is not far behind.

998
01:16:31,494 --> 01:16:32,494
半兽人群？
Orc pack?

999
01:16:32,518 --> 01:16:35,605
除了家族外，你还和谁说了探险的事？
Who did you tell about your quest, beyond your kin?

1000
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:36,666
没人
No one.

1001
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:37,637
你和谁说了？
Who did you tell?

1002
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:39,410
没人，我发誓！
No one, I swear!

1003
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:41,416
都林血脉怎么了？
What in Dorin's name is going on?

1004
01:16:41,565 --> 01:16:43,385
你被追捕了
You're being hunted.

1005
01:16:44,172 --> 01:16:45,594
我们得离开这里
DWALIN: We have to get out of here.

1006
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:49,592
不行，我们没有马，它们脱缰了
ORI: We can't! We have no ponies. They bolted.

1007
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:51,342
我把它们引开
RADAGAST: I'll draw them off.

1008
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:54,548
这些是刚达巴座狼，它们会追上你的
GANDALF: These are Gundabad wargs. They will outrun you!

1009
01:16:54,587 --> 01:16:57,608
这些是拉斯戈柏尔兔子
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

1010
01:16:57,987 --> 01:17:00,420
我倒想让它们试试
I'd like to see them try.

1011
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,710
[Wargs howl]

1012
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,513
来抓我呀！
Come and get me!

1013
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,880
[Radagast laughing]

1014
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:21,309
[Wargs bark]

1015
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:25,404
快点
GANDALF: Come on!

1016
01:17:53,683 --> 01:17:55,805
靠紧，前进！
Stay together. Move!

1017
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:08,279
欧力，不！
THORIN: Ori, no!

1018
01:18:08,372 --> 01:18:09,888
回来
Come back.

1019
01:18:12,638 --> 01:18:14,738
你们全都跟上，跟上，快！
All of you, come on, come on! Quick!

1020
01:18:17,223 --> 01:18:19,541
你把我们带到哪去？
THORIN: Where're you leading us?

1021
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,541
矮人渣在那边！

1022
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,241
追！

1023
01:19:27,715 --> 01:19:28,566
前进！
GANDALF: Move!

1024
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,283
跑
Run!

1025
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:48,457
他们在那！
GLOIN: There they are!

1026
01:19:50,462 --> 01:19:52,673
这边！快点！
GANDALF: This way! Quickly!

1027
01:20:03,837 --> 01:20:05,618
我想还有很多要来！
KILI: I think there's more coming!

1028
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:08,905
奇力，射死他们！
THORIN: Kíli! Shoot them!

1029
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,619
我们被包围了！
FILI: We're surrounded!

1030
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,889
甘道夫呢？
FILI: Where's Gandalf?

1031
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,803
他抛弃我们了
DWALIN: He's abandoned us!

1032
01:20:29,249 --> 01:20:31,069
稳住阵地！
THORIN: Hold your ground!

1033
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:42,363
这边，蠢货！
GANDALF: This way, you fools!

1034
01:20:42,997 --> 01:20:44,397
快，前进！
THORIN: Com'on, move!

1035
01:20:46,581 --> 01:20:48,401
快点，都快点！
Quickly! All of you!

1036
01:20:50,739 --> 01:20:52,139
快，快，快
THORIN: Go, go, go!

1037
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:03,729
九，十
GANDALF: .. nine, ten...

1038
01:21:05,935 --> 01:21:08,448
奇力，跑
Kíli! Run!

1039
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,374
[Hunting horn]

1040
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:25,579
[Noise of arrows]

1041
01:21:48,078 --> 01:21:49,583
是精灵
Elves.

1042
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,654
我看不清这通道通向哪儿
DWALIN: I cannot see where the pathway leads.

1043
01:21:54,746 --> 01:21:56,090
我们走还是不走？
Do we follow it or no?

1044
01:21:56,091 --> 01:21:57,545
当然要走了
BOFUR: We follow it, of course!

1045
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,388
我认为那很明智
GANDALF: I think that would be wise.

1046
01:23:01,259 --> 01:23:03,819
伊姆拉里斯河谷
The valley of Imladris.

1047
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:08,280
通常是叫另一个名字
In the common tongue, it's known by another name.

1048
01:23:09,504 --> 01:23:10,954
瑞文戴尔
Rivendell.

1049
01:23:13,652 --> 01:23:17,751
这里有大海东岸所剩无几的舒适小屋
GANDALF: Here lies the last homely house, east of the sea.

1050
01:23:20,048 --> 01:23:21,850
这就是你一直盘算的计划
This was your plan all along...

1051
01:23:22,561 --> 01:23:24,661
向敌人寻求庇护
to seek refuge with our enemy.

1052
01:23:25,179 --> 01:23:28,473
这里没有敌人，索林・橡木盾
You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield.

1053
01:23:28,794 --> 01:23:33,190
这个河谷能找到的唯一敌意 就是你自己带来的这个
The only ill-will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself.

1054
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:37,751
你认为精灵会为我们的探险赐福？
THORIN: You think the Elves... will give our quest their blessing?

1055
01:23:38,126 --> 01:23:39,649
他们会试图阻止我们的
They will try to stop us.

1056
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:41,456
当然，他们会
Of course, they will.

1057
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:43,970
但我们有问题需要解答
But we have questions that need to be answered.

1058
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:51,009
如果我们想成功，就需要策略
If we are to be successful, this will need to be handled with tact...

1059
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:52,633
尊重
and respect...

1060
01:23:52,804 --> 01:23:54,904
和不小的魅力
and no small degree of charm.

1061
01:23:55,677 --> 01:23:58,477
所以你要把沟通留给我来做
Which is why you will leave the talking to me.

1062
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,358
米斯兰达（甘道夫的精灵名）

Ah, Lindir.

1064
01:25:01,424 --> 01:25:02,824
提防着点
Stay sharp.

1065
01:25:03,824 --> 01:25:05,824
我听说你来河谷了

1066
01:25:06,376 --> 01:25:08,241
我有话和艾隆大人说
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1067
01:25:08,335 --> 01:25:10,435
艾隆大人不在这里
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1068
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,000
不在这里？
Not here?

1069
01:25:13,293 --> 01:25:14,693
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

1070
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,855
[Hunting horn]

1071
01:25:27,059 --> 01:25:28,879
[Thorin speaks dwelvish]

1072
01:25:28,918 --> 01:25:30,872
靠拢！
Close ranks!

甘道夫！
Gandalf!

艾隆大人
Lоrd Εlrоn.

1075
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,020
我的好朋友

1076
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,820
你去哪了？

1077
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,820
我们猎杀了一群来自南方的半兽人

1078
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,120
在秘密隘口附近也杀了一些

1079
01:26:15,031 --> 01:26:18,468
半兽人离我们的边界这么近真是奇怪
Strange for orcs to come so close to our borders.

1080
01:26:19,352 --> 01:26:22,739
某个东西或某个人把他们引来了
Something or someone has drawn them near.

1081
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:24,909
或许是因为我们
GANDALF: Ah, that may have been us.

1082
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:33,448
欢迎索林，索恩之子
Welcome Thorin, son of Thráin.

1083
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:36,369
我不认为我们见过面
I do not believe we have met.

1084
01:26:37,321 --> 01:26:39,217
你有你祖父的仪态
You have your Grandfather's bearing.

1085
01:26:40,554 --> 01:26:42,960
我认识索尔，在他统治山下时
I knew Thrór when he ruled under the mountain.

1086
01:26:43,046 --> 01:26:45,739
真的？他从没提到你
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1087
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:56,261
（精灵语）
[Speaks Elvish]

1088
01:26:57,415 --> 01:27:01,975
他在说什么？是在侮辱我们吗？
GLOIN: What is he saying? Does he offer us insult?

1089
01:27:02,171 --> 01:27:06,145
不，葛罗林大人，他在说给你们食物
No Master Glóin, he's offering you food.

1090
01:27:12,922 --> 01:27:14,042
Ah Well...

1091
01:27:14,435 --> 01:27:16,255
这样的话，带路吧
In that case, lead on.

1092
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:21,823
试试看，就一口
Try it. Just a mouthful.

01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:23,847
我不喜欢绿色食物
I don't like green food.

1094
01:27:24,808 --> 01:27:26,628
肉在哪？
Where's the meat?

1095
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,307
他们有炸土豆吗？
Have they got any chips?

1096
01:27:30,097 --> 01:27:33,946
感谢你善意地邀请我们 我……我没穿上盛宴着装
GANDALF: Kind of you to invite us, I'm... not really dressed for diner.

1097
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:35,779
你从来就没穿上过
ELROND: Well, you never are.

1098
01:27:56,164 --> 01:27:58,383
这是兽咬剑
ELROND: This is Orcrist...

1099
01:27:58,735 --> 01:28:00,330
斩妖精剑
the Goblin- cleaver.

1100
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:05,206
闻名的刀刃……由西方高等精灵锻造
A famous blade, forged by the High Elves of the West.

1101
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:07,601
我的国王
My kin.

1102
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:10,209
愿它能为你好好效力
May it serve you well.

1103
01:28:10,428 --> 01:28:13,373
这是格兰瑞
And this is Glamdring...

1104
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,215
敌击剑，贡多林国王之剑
The Foe- hammer, sword of the king of Gondolin.

1105
01:28:18,356 --> 01:28:21,156
这些剑是为第一纪元妖精战争铸造
These swords were made for the Goblin wars of the First-

1106
01:28:21,174 --> 01:28:22,357
我不在乎，伙计
BALIN: I wouldn't bother, laddie.

1107
01:28:22,529 --> 01:28:25,995
剑因在战争中的伟大功绩而得名
Swords are named for the great deeds they do in war.

1108
01:28:26,089 --> 01:28:28,889
你是说我的剑没经历过战争？
What're you saying, my sword hasn't seen battles?

1109
01:28:29,056 --> 01:28:31,210
我还不确定它是把剑
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1110
01:28:32,342 --> 01:28:34,339
更像是开信刀，真的
More of a letter opener, really.

1111
01:28:35,496 --> 01:28:37,001
你怎么拿到这些的？
ELROND: How did you come with these?

1112
01:28:37,096 --> 01:28:40,447
我们在东方大道的巨怪储物窖里找到的
GANDALF: We found them in a troll hoard on the Great East road,

1113
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:43,380
而后就遇到半兽人伏击了
shortly before we were ambushed by orcs.

1114
01:28:44,264 --> 01:28:48,386
你们在东方大道上做什么呢？
And what were you doing on the Great East road?

1115
01:28:50,066 --> 01:28:52,227
我们的事与精灵无关
THORIN: Our business is no concern of Elves.

1116
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:55,143
拜托，索林，给他看地图
GANDALF: For goodness sake. Thorin, show him the map!

1117
01:28:55,228 --> 01:28:57,328
那是我的子民的遗产
THORIN: It is the legacy of my people.

1118
01:28:57,514 --> 01:28:59,334
我的职责是保护它！
It's mine to protect!

1119
01:28:59,749 --> 01:29:01,207
包括我们的秘密
As are its secrets.

1120
01:29:01,317 --> 01:29:03,879
别再让我为矮人的固执烦恼了
GANDALF: Save me from the stubbornness of dwarves.

1121
01:29:04,143 --> 01:29:06,718
你的高傲会让你垮台
Your pride will be your downfall.

1122
01:29:07,322 --> 01:29:11,522
你面前站着一个中土世界 为数不多的能看懂那地图的人
You stand here in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth who can read that map.

1123
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:13,820
让艾隆大人看看！
Show it to Lord Elrond!

1124
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:21,920
索林，别给

1125
01:29:32,346 --> 01:29:33,765
伊鲁柏
ELROND: Erebor.

1126
01:29:35,281 --> 01:29:38,528
你对这地图有什么兴趣？
What is your interest in this map?

1127
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,880
主要是学术上的
GANDALF: It's mainly academic.

1128
01:29:42,283 --> 01:29:46,163
如你所知，这些东西有时包含隐藏讯息
As you know, this sort of artifacts sometimes contains hidden texts.

1129
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:55,471
你还看得懂古矮人语，对吧？
You still read ancient dwarvish, do you not?

1130
01:30:00,178 --> 01:30:02,707
对，色斯文伊西尔
ELROND: Yeah, “Cirth ithil”.

1131
01:30:03,438 --> 01:30:05,087
月亮如尼文
GANDALF: Moon runes...

1132
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:07,663
当然
Of course.

1133
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:10,391
一个容易被忽视的东西
An easy thing to miss.

1134
01:30:10,704 --> 01:30:14,342
在此，对，要读懂月亮如尼文必须借助
ELROND: And in this case, that is true. Moon runes can only be read by the light

1135
01:30:14,353 --> 01:30:19,633
与它们被写下那天相同季节的 相同形状的月亮的月光
of the moon of the same shape and season as the day on which they were written.

1136
01:30:20,155 --> 01:30:21,600
你能读懂它们？
THORIN: Can you read them?

1137
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:29,773
这些如尼文写于近乎两百年前的
ELROND: These runes were written on a mid-summer's eve

1138
01:30:29,795 --> 01:30:34,339
某个仲夏节前夜，当时是新月
by the light of a crescent moon nearly two hundred years ago.

1139
01:30:34,754 --> 01:30:37,876
似乎你注定该来瑞文戴尔
It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell.

1140
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:40,616
命运与你同在，索林・橡木盾
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

1141
01:30:40,687 --> 01:30:43,914
今晚相同的月亮照耀着我们
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

1142
01:31:03,268 --> 01:31:07,875
当鸫敲石时站在灰石旁
“Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks,”

1143
01:31:08,056 --> 01:31:12,858
都林日落日最后的余晖
“and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day

1144
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:16,388
将照耀在钥匙孔上
will shine upon the key- hole”.

1145
01:31:16,497 --> 01:31:17,557
都林日？
BILBO: Durin's Day?

1146
01:31:17,588 --> 01:31:19,682
那是矮人的新年
GANDALF: It the dwarves' new year,

1147
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:24,184
那时秋季最后一次月落和冬季 第一次日出将同时出现于空中
when the last moon of Autumn and the first sun of Winter appear in the sky together.

1148
01:31:24,311 --> 01:31:25,632
这是坏消息
THORIN: This is ill news.

1149
01:31:26,262 --> 01:31:29,166
夏季要结束了，都林日立马就来了
Summer is passing. Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

1150
01:31:29,229 --> 01:31:30,349
我们还有时间
BALIN: We still have time.

1151
01:31:30,507 --> 01:31:31,389
时间，做什么？
BILBO: Time, for what?

1152
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:32,616
找到入口
BALIN: To find the entrance.

1153
01:31:33,117 --> 01:31:36,897
我们必须找到绝对准确的位置和时机
We have to be standing at exactly the right spot, at exactly the right time.

1154
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:40,776
那时，只有那时，门才会开启
Then, and only then... can the door be opened.

1155
01:31:40,847 --> 01:31:44,651
那么这就是你们的目的，进入大山
ELROND: So this is your purpose. To enter the mountain.

1156
01:31:45,556 --> 01:31:46,956
那又怎么了？
THORIN: What of it?

1157
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:50,608
有些人认为这不明智
ELROND: There are some who would not deem it wise.

1158
01:31:51,608 --> 01:31:53,428
你指的是谁？
GANDALF: Who do you mean?

1159
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:58,406
你不是唯一看护中土世界的卫士
You are not the only guardian to stand watching over Middle- earth.

1160
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:26,406
那些矮人……主人

1161
01:32:28,606 --> 01:32:30,406
我们跟丢了

1162
01:32:34,206 --> 01:32:37,606
被臭精灵伏击，我们……

1163
01:32:38,206 --> 01:32:40,706
我不要借口

1164
01:32:47,306 --> 01:32:51,006
我要矮人国王的头

1165
01:32:52,206 --> 01:32:53,706
我们人数不足

1166
01:32:53,906 --> 01:32:55,406
我们无能为力

1167
01:32:56,306 --> 01:32:59,706
我差点丢了命

1168
01:33:00,406 --> 01:33:01,706
你最好……

1169
01:33:03,706 --> 01:33:05,106
为此偿命

1170
01:33:25,406 --> 01:33:30,706
矮人渣很快会露面

1171
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:33,706
放出口令

1172
01:33:35,406 --> 01:33:37,406
砍了他们的头有赏

1173
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:01,955
庞柏！
Bombur!

1174
01:34:05,309 --> 01:34:07,614
[Everyone laughing]

1175
01:34:08,705 --> 01:34:12,868
不论我们有没帮忙，这些矮人都会往山里前进
GANDALF: With or without our help, these dwarves will march on the mountain.

1176
01:34:13,053 --> 01:34:15,949
他们决意收回自己的家园
They're determined to reclaim their homeland.

1177
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:21,025
我不相信索林・橡木盾 觉得自己该对任何人负责
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he's answerable to anyone.

1178
01:34:21,456 --> 01:34:26,702
我也不要，因为他们不是要向我负责
ELROND: Nor for that matter am I, cause it's not me they must answer to.

1179
01:34:38,397 --> 01:34:40,199
盖拉德利尔夫人
Lady Galadriel.

1180
01:34:41,146 --> 01:34:42,943
米斯兰达
Mithrandir.

1181
01:34:44,443 --> 01:34:46,743
好久不见了

1182
01:34:49,343 --> 01:34:51,843
岁月或许改变了我

1183
01:34:53,343 --> 01:34:55,943
但罗瑞安夫人却没变

1184
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:05,511
我不知道艾隆大人请您来了
GANDALF: 'd no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.

1185
01:35:05,606 --> 01:35:07,006
他没有
SARUMAN: He didn't.

1186
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:09,001
是我
I did.

1187
01:35:17,584 --> 01:35:18,984
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

1188
01:35:19,396 --> 01:35:22,925
你近来很忙，老朋友
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1189
01:35:24,277 --> 01:35:26,097
告诉我，甘道夫……
Tell me, Gandalf...

1190
01:35:26,626 --> 01:35:32,147
你以为你这些计划和安排会无人察觉吗？
Did you think these plans and schemes of yours would go unnoticed?

1191
01:35:32,288 --> 01:35:33,688
无人察觉？
GANDALF: Unnoticed?

1192
01:35:35,164 --> 01:35:36,564
不，我……
No, I...

1193
01:35:36,688 --> 01:35:39,455
我只是在做自己觉得对的事
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

1194
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:43,033
恶龙……一直困扰着你
Galadriel: The dragon... has long been on your mind.

1195
01:35:43,425 --> 01:35:45,245
对，夫人
GANDALF: It is true, my Lady.

1196
01:35:45,426 --> 01:35:47,650
斯矛戈不对任何人效忠
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1197
01:35:48,096 --> 01:35:50,196
但如果他与敌人一道
But if he should side with the enemy,

1198
01:35:51,016 --> 01:35:53,816
他们会利用恶龙制造可怕后果
the dragon could be used to terrible effect.

1199
01:35:54,216 --> 01:35:55,616
什么敌人？
SARUMAN: What enemy?

1200
01:35:56,342 --> 01:35:58,855
甘道夫，敌人被打败了
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1201
01:35:59,355 --> 01:36:01,175
索伦被击败了
Sauron is vanquished.

1202
01:36:01,512 --> 01:36:03,612
他再也无法恢复全力
He can never regain his full strength.

1203
01:36:04,385 --> 01:36:05,697
甘道夫……
Gandalf...

1204
01:36:05,798 --> 01:36:09,803
四百年来，我们都和平地生活
for four hundred years, we have lived in peace,

1205
01:36:09,827 --> 01:36:12,832
这是艰难获得，小心提防来的和平
a hard won watchful peace!

1206
01:36:12,903 --> 01:36:14,926
我们……我们和平吗？
GANDALF: Are we- are we at peace?

1207
01:36:17,025 --> 01:36:19,260
巨怪从山里下来
Trolls have come down from the mountains,

1208
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:21,875
他们袭击村落，毁坏农田
they are raiding villages, destroying farms.

1209
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,302
半兽人在路上攻击我们
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1210
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:26,411
这不是战争的序曲
ELROND: Hardly a prelude to war.

1211
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:28,487
你总是爱插手
SARUMAN: Always you must meddle.

1212
01:36:29,027 --> 01:36:31,024
寻找不存在的麻烦
Looking for trouble where none exist!

1213
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:32,612
让他说
GALADRIEL: Let him speak.

1214
01:36:34,358 --> 01:36:39,202
除了邪恶的斯矛戈之外，还有个东西
GANDALF: There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug,

1215
01:36:39,472 --> 01:36:41,572
一个更为强大的东西
something far more powerful.

1216
01:36:43,057 --> 01:36:48,166
我们可以对它熟视无睹 但它不会忽视我们，我向你们保证
We can remain blind to it, but it will not be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1217
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,920
在绿林里满是病态
A sickness hides over the Greenwood.

1218
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:56,338
那里的樵夫现在叫它 幽暗密林，他们……他们说……
The woodsmen who live there now call it Mirkwook, and uh, they s-  they say...

1219
01:36:58,033 --> 01:37:03,458
别停下，告诉我们樵夫说了什么
SARUMAN: Well, don't stop now, tell us what the woodsmen say?

1220
01:37:03,575 --> 01:37:06,973
他们说有个死灵法师住在多尔哥多
GANDALF: They speak of a Necromancer, living in Dol Guldur,

1221
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:10,212
那是能唤起死灵的巫师
a sorcerer who would summon the dead.

1222
01:37:10,464 --> 01:37:11,782
荒唐
SARUMAN: That's absurd.

1223
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:14,694
世界上没有这种力量
No such power exists in this world.

1224
01:37:14,851 --> 01:37:19,374
这个……死灵法师不过是个凡人
This... Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man.

1225
01:37:19,645 --> 01:37:22,228
涉猎黑暗魔法的巫师
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1226
01:37:22,362 --> 01:37:24,674
我也这么想，但是
GANDALF: And so I though too. But...

1227
01:37:25,165 --> 01:37:26,290
瑞达加斯特看见了
Radagast has seen- .

1228
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,405
瑞达加斯特？
Radagast has seen- C Radagast?

1229
01:37:27,866 --> 01:37:30,666
别跟我提褐袍巫师瑞达加斯特
Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown.

1230
01:37:31,318 --> 01:37:33,138
他是个蠢货
He's a foolish fellow.

1231
01:37:33,339 --> 01:37:37,393
他很奇怪，我承认，他过着隐居生活
Well... he's odd, I grant you, he lives a solitary life.

1232
01:37:37,665 --> 01:37:38,727
不是那样
SARUMAN: It's not that.

1233
01:37:38,829 --> 01:37:42,123
是他吃了过多蘑菇
It's his excessive consumption of mushrooms.

1234
01:37:42,616 --> 01:37:46,504
那些弄乱了他的脑子，弄黄了他的牙齿
They've addled his brain, and yellowed his teeth.

1235
01:37:47,004 --> 01:37:48,404
我警告过他
I warned him.

1236
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:51,960
一个埃斯塔力在丛林里游荡不合适 （埃斯塔力：人类口中的巫师）
It is unbefitting one of the Istari wandering the wood...

1237
01:37:51,992 --> 01:37:54,038
你带了东西来
GALADRIEL (V.O.): You carry something.

1238
01:37:55,976 --> 01:37:58,435
是瑞达加斯特给你的
It came to you from Radagast...

1239
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:01,385
他在多尔哥多找到的
He found it in Dul Guldur...

1240
01:38:02,721 --> 01:38:03,841
对
GANDALF: Yes.

1241
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:06,869
给我看
GALADRIEL: Show me.

1242
01:38:09,904 --> 01:38:13,044
[Saruman keeps on speaking]

1243
01:38:17,316 --> 01:38:20,016
那是什么？
What is that?

1244
01:38:20,735 --> 01:38:23,837
魔多遗物
GALADRIEL: A relic of Mordor.

1245
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,835
魔窟剑……
ELROND: A Morgul blade...

1246
01:38:36,437 --> 01:38:39,195
是为巫师之王安格玛铸造的
GALADRIEL: Made for the witch-king of Angmar,

1247
01:38:39,496 --> 01:38:42,200
并与其一同埋葬了
and buried with him.

1248
01:38:44,596 --> 01:38:46,367
安格玛战败时
When Angmar fell,

1249
01:38:46,734 --> 01:38:49,583
北方的人带走了他的尸体
the men of the North took his body,

1250
01:38:49,608 --> 01:38:52,988
把他的全部所有物封在鲁道尔高山上
and all that he possessed was sealed within the high fells of Rhudaur.

1251
01:38:54,114 --> 01:38:56,914
他们把他埋在岩石深处
Deep within the rock, they buried him...

1252
01:38:57,596 --> 01:39:00,156
那是个暗得不可能
in a tomb so dark...

1253
01:39:00,758 --> 01:39:02,726
见到亮光的坟墓
it couldn't have come to light.

1254
01:39:02,828 --> 01:39:04,648
这不可能
ELROND: This is not possible.

1255
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:10,261
那些坟墓上有强大咒语，不可能被开启
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs, they cannot be opened!

1256
01:39:10,635 --> 01:39:15,601
我们有什么证据证明 这个武器来自安格玛坟墓？
SARUMAN: What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar's grave?

1257
01:39:16,304 --> 01:39:17,704
我没有
GANDALF: I have none.

1258
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,580
因为根本没有
SARUMAN: Because there is none.

1259
01:39:20,396 --> 01:39:22,378
我们来分析看所知的情况
Let us examine what we know.

1260
01:39:22,972 --> 01:39:27,529
一群半兽人大胆地跨过了布鲁南河
A single orc pack has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1261
01:39:28,275 --> 01:39:31,248
一把旧时的剑被发现了
A dagger from a by-gone age has been found.

1262
01:39:31,781 --> 01:39:37,067
一个自称是死灵法师的凡人巫师
And a human sorcerer who calls himself the Necromancer,

1263
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:41,251
在废弃的堡垒里住了下来
has taken up residence in a ruined fortress.

1264
01:39:42,322 --> 01:39:45,358
这些毕竟不是很重要
It's not so very much, after all.

1265
01:39:46,093 --> 01:39:51,239
然而，这群矮人才让我很担忧
The question of this dwarvish company however, troubles me deeply.

1266
01:39:51,302 --> 01:39:53,159
我没信服，甘道夫
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1267
01:39:53,526 --> 01:39:56,797
我不认为我能容忍这么一次探险
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.

1268
01:39:57,296 --> 01:40:01,270
如果他们来找我，我就不会让他们这样失望
If they come to me, I might just spare them this disappointment.

1269
01:40:01,754 --> 01:40:04,884
我不会假装理解你说要给他们希望的理由
I will not pretend to understand your reasons for raising their hopes...

1270
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,736
他们走了
GALADRIEL (V.O.): They are leaving.

1271
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,820
[Saruman still speaking]

1272
01:40:08,959 --> 01:40:10,079
是
GANDALF: Yes.

1273
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:14,411
你知道？
GALADRIEL: You knew.

1274
01:40:14,839 --> 01:40:16,702
[Saruman still speaking]

1275
01:40:19,647 --> 01:40:22,447
恐怕对此没有别的办法了
SARUMAN: .. I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

1276
01:40:24,364 --> 01:40:25,979
艾隆大人
LINDIR: My Lord Elrond.

1277
01:40:26,143 --> 01:40:27,543
矮人们
The dwarves...

1278
01:40:27,943 --> 01:40:29,343
他们走了
they've gone.

1279
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:36,239
警惕点儿
THORIN: Be on your guard,

1280
01:40:36,419 --> 01:40:39,232
我们要进入荒野边缘了
we're about to step over the Edge of the Wild.

1281
01:40:39,423 --> 01:40:41,819
巴林，你熟悉这条路，带路吧
Balin, you know this path, lead on.

1282
01:40:41,991 --> 01:40:43,111
是
BALIN: Ah Aye.

1283
01:40:49,218 --> 01:40:51,038
巴金斯大人
THORIN: Master Baggins,

1284
01:40:51,327 --> 01:40:53,147
我建议你跟上
I suggest you keep up.

1285
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,880
你要跟随他们？
GALADRIEL (V.O.): You will follow them.

1286
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:10,110
是
GANDALF: Yes.

1287
01:41:10,216 --> 01:41:13,088
你帮助索林・橡木盾是对的
GALADRIEL: You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield.

1288
01:41:13,558 --> 01:41:19,751
但我怕这次探险已经 惊动了尚未知晓的力量
But I fear this quest has set in motion forces we do not yet understand.

1289
01:41:20,571 --> 01:41:24,463
魔窟剑之谜必须解决
The riddle of the Morgul blade must be answered.

1290
01:41:24,741 --> 01:41:27,330
那个在阴影里移动的东西不可见
Something moves in the shadows, unseen,

1291
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:30,449
它躲着我们，不愿露面
hidden from our side, it will not show itself...

1292
01:41:30,587 --> 01:41:31,987
还不愿露面
not yet.

1293
01:41:32,571 --> 01:41:35,404
但它的力量每天都在增加
But every day it grows in strength.

1294
01:41:35,574 --> 01:41:37,279
你必须小心
You must be careful.

1295
01:41:37,428 --> 01:41:38,548
是
GANDALF: Yes...

1296
01:41:42,071 --> 01:41:43,695
米斯兰达
GALADRIEL: Mithrandir.

1297
01:41:45,446 --> 01:41:47,131
为什么选哈夫林？（哈夫林：即霍比特人）
Why the Halfling?

1298
01:41:49,413 --> 01:41:51,045
我不知道
GANDALF: I don't know.

1299
01:41:54,006 --> 01:42:00,652
萨鲁曼相信只有强大力量才能震慑邪恶
Saruman believes that it is only a great power that can hold evil in check,

1300
01:42:01,401 --> 01:42:03,289
我不相信
but that is not what I have found.

1301
01:42:04,906 --> 01:42:08,436
我觉得……平凡琐事
I found it is... the small things,

1302
01:42:08,659 --> 01:42:11,397
普通人每天的生活
everyday deeds of ordinary folk,

1303
01:42:11,536 --> 01:42:14,277
能遏制黑暗
that keep the darkness at bay...

1304
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:17,934
善与爱的平凡举动
simple acts of kindness and love.

1305
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:22,537
为什么是比尔博・巴金斯？
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1306
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:29,280
或许是因为我害怕
Perhaps it is because I am afraid...

1307
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:32,851
他能给我勇气
and he gives me courage.

1308
01:42:37,378 --> 01:42:40,706
别害怕，米斯兰达
GALADRIEL: Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1309
01:42:42,683 --> 01:42:44,786
你不孤单
You are not alone.

1310
01:42:47,886 --> 01:42:50,386
只要需要我的帮助

1311
01:42:50,886 --> 01:42:52,786
我就会来

1312
01:44:17,141 --> 01:44:22,318
[Thunder]

1313
01:44:24,464 --> 01:44:26,776
好，稳住！
Alright, hold on!

1314
01:44:32,906 --> 01:44:36,624
[Bilbo slips, all shout]

1315
01:44:38,393 --> 01:44:40,720
我们要找个避雨处！
THORIN: We must find shelter!

1316
01:44:40,953 --> 01:44:42,864
小心！
DWALIN: Look out!

1317
01:44:50,378 --> 01:44:51,778
稳住！
BIFUR: Hold on!

1318
01:44:56,094 --> 01:44:57,998
这不是雷雨！
BALIN: This is no thunderstorms!

1319
01:44:58,115 --> 01:44:59,935
这是雷战！
It's a thunder- battle!

1320
01:45:01,652 --> 01:45:02,772
看！
Look!

1321
01:45:04,042 --> 01:45:07,088
Rock breaking]

1322
01:45:07,804 --> 01:45:09,319
上帝保佑
BOFUR: Well bless me.

1323
01:45:09,623 --> 01:45:11,121
传说是真的！
The legends are true!

1324
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:15,129
巨人！石头巨人！
Giants! Stone giants!

1325
01:45:22,179 --> 01:45:24,786
躲起来，蠢货！
THORIN: Take cover, you fool!

1326
01:45:25,732 --> 01:45:27,286
稳住！
NORI: Hold on!

1327
01:45:35,474 --> 01:45:37,334
- 怎么了？ - 奇力，抓住我的手！
FILI: Kíli, grab my hand!

1328
01:45:36,007 --> 01:45:37,634
FILI: Kíli, grab my hand! C What's happening?

1329
01:46:01,964 --> 01:46:02,784
走！走！走
Go, go, go! .

1330
01:46:02,785 --> 01:46:05,125
跑，快点，跟上！
Go, go, go! C Let's run! Come on, keep on.

1331
01:46:55,193 --> 01:46:56,645
不！
THORIN: Noooo!

1332
01:46:57,449 --> 01:46:59,511
不！
Nooo!

1333
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:10,023
不！奇力！
No! Kíli!

1334
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:19,200
我们没事！我们还活着！
KILI: We're alright! We're alive!

1335
01:47:20,402 --> 01:47:21,330
比尔博呢？
BFUR: Where's Bilbo?

1336
01:47:21,534 --> 01:47:23,354
霍比特人呢？
Where's the hobbit?

1337
01:47:24,266 --> 01:47:26,070
[Bilbo yells]

1338
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:32,861
抓住我的手！
Grab my hand!

1339
01:47:32,862 --> 01:47:34,085
比尔博！
Grab my hand! C Bilbo!

1340
01:47:35,609 --> 01:47:37,429
加油，抓住！
BOFUR: Come on and take it!

1341
01:47:38,075 --> 01:47:39,223
我来拉你，伙计
BALIN: I've got you, lad.

1342
01:47:39,242 --> 01:47:41,247
加油，加油！
Come on, come on!

1343
01:47:52,489 --> 01:47:53,889
拉到了！
THORIN: Get him!

1344
01:47:58,687 --> 01:48:00,106
我以为把小偷给弄丢了
DWALIN: : I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1345
01:48:00,177 --> 01:48:01,297
不！
THORIN: No!

1346
01:48:01,539 --> 01:48:04,239
自他离开家起他就被弄丢了
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1347
01:48:04,865 --> 01:48:06,965
他本就不该来
He should never have come.

1348
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:08,963
他在我们中没有位置
He has no place amongst us.

1349
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,110
德瓦林！
Dwalin!

1350
01:48:18,432 --> 01:48:20,932
看起来很安全，看看附近
THORIN: It looks safe enough. Search nearby.

1351
01:48:21,556 --> 01:48:24,147
山里的洞穴不太可能没人住
Caves in the mountain are seldom unoccupied.

1352
01:48:27,761 --> 01:48:29,581
这里什么也没有
DWALIN: There's nothing here.

1353
01:48:31,557 --> 01:48:33,992
好吧，生火了
GLOIN: Right then. Let's get the fire started.

1354
01:48:34,001 --> 01:48:36,101
不行，不生火，不要在这里
THORIN: No. No fires. Not in this place.

1355
01:48:37,164 --> 01:48:38,584
睡会儿觉
Get some sleep...

1356
01:48:38,768 --> 01:48:41,091
黎明一到我们就启程
We start at the first light.

1357
01:48:41,591 --> 01:48:44,612
我们该在山里等到甘道夫回来
BALIN: We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalf joined us.

1358
01:48:45,355 --> 01:48:46,589
那是计划
That was the plan.

1359
01:48:46,879 --> 01:48:47,969
计划变了
THORIN: Plans change.

1360
01:48:48,493 --> 01:48:49,498
波弗
Bofur...

1361
01:48:49,877 --> 01:48:51,812
你第一个放哨
Take the first watch.

1362
01:48:56,101 --> 01:48:58,075
[Warg growls]

1363
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:01,412
刚留下的气味！

1364
01:49:01,812 --> 01:49:06,612

01:49:44,177 --> 01:49:45,297
好了
BILBO: Okay...

1366

回瑞文戴尔去
BILBO: Back to Rivendell.

You're part of the company. You're one of us.

1370

我现在不是了，对吧？
BILBO: I'm not now, am I?

1371
01:50:22,851 --> 01:50:25,583
索林说我本不该来，他说得对
Thorin said I should never have come, and he was right.

1372
01:50:26,264 --> 01:50:29,543
我不是图克家的，我是巴金斯家的 我不知道那时自己在想什么
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins, I don't know what I was thinking.

1373
01:50:31,343 --> 01:50:32,807
我真不该跑出来
I should've never ran out the door.

1374

你想家了，我理解

You're used to th-  to this life, to living on the road,

抱歉，我不是……

也不是国王了，这样……
And you're not a king. Which makes you...

1424

02:10:52,379 --> 02:10:53,837
咬剑！
The Biter!

1649
02:10:54,065 --> 02:10:57,274
它的刀刃斩掉了一千个头！
The blade that sliced a thousand neck!

1650
02:10:57,345 --> 02:11:03,506
砍他们，打他们，剥了皮，全杀掉！
Slash them, beat them, peel them, kill them all!

1651
02:11:03,584 --> 02:11:05,456
把他的头砍掉！
Cut up his head!

1652
02:11:07,342 --> 02:11:09,162
[Big explosion]

1653
02:11:35,203 --> 02:11:37,420
拿起武器
Take up arms...

1654
02:11:38,108 --> 02:11:39,699
作战
Fight.

1655
02:11:40,716 --> 02:11:42,316
作战
Fight!

1656
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:54,375
他拿着敌击剑，打剑，亮如白昼
GREAT ORC: He wields the Foe-hammer, the Beater, bright as daylight!

1657
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,820
跟我来
GANDALF: Follow me.

1658
02:12:20,194 --> 02:12:21,314
快
Quick!

1659
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:25,160
跑
Run!

1660
02:12:33,531 --> 02:12:35,630
给我们！
GOLLUM: Give it to us!

1661
02:12:35,959 --> 02:12:40,185
[Gollum screaming]

1662
02:12:55,342 --> 02:12:57,878
是我们的
It's ours.

1663
02:12:58,105 --> 02:13:01,144
是我们的
It's ours!

1664
02:13:13,472 --> 02:13:15,893
[Gollum yells]

1665
02:13:25,206 --> 02:13:26,326
小偷！
GOLLUM: Thiefs!

1666
02:13:29,019 --> 02:13:31,071
巴金斯
Baggins!

1667
02:13:38,108 --> 02:13:39,508
快点
GANDALF: Quickly!

1668
02:13:41,457 --> 02:13:42,857
别停下
Don't stop.

1669
02:13:48,498 --> 02:13:50,604
一！二！
DWALIN: One! Two!

1670
02:13:52,934 --> 02:13:54,347
稳住！
Post!

1671
02:13:57,065 --> 02:13:58,633
冲！
Charge!

1672
02:14:44,753 --> 02:14:47,033
切断绳索！
THORIN: Cut the ropes!

1673
02:15:09,688 --> 02:15:11,107
跟上，快！
GANDALF: Come on, quickly!

1674
02:15:11,163 --> 02:15:12,563
快！
Come on!

1675
02:15:24,892 --> 02:15:26,319
跳！
THORIN: Jump!

1676
02:15:54,199 --> 02:15:55,599
跑！
Come on!

1677
02:16:33,482 --> 02:16:35,901
你们以为能逃脱？
GREAT ORC: You thought you could escape me.

1678
02:16:39,558 --> 02:16:42,970
你现在要做什么，巫师？
What you gonna do now, wizard?

1679
02:16:43,689 --> 02:16:45,186
不！
Oh no!

1680
02:16:46,561 --> 02:16:48,080
Aouh!

1681
02:16:50,679 --> 02:16:52,499
够狠了
That will do it.

1682
02:17:00,166 --> 02:17:02,878
[All screaming]

1683
02:17:27,153 --> 02:17:29,253
幸好不是太惨
BOFUR: Oh, that could have been worse.

1684
02:17:32,234 --> 02:17:34,942
你没在开玩笑吧？
DWALIN: You've got to be joking!

1685
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:42,421
甘道夫
THORIN: Gandalf!

1686
02:17:46,917 --> 02:17:48,727
太多了，我们敌不过
DWALIN: There's too many, we can't fight them.

1687
02:17:48,743 --> 02:17:50,305
只有一样东西能救我们
GANDALF: Only one thing will save us.

1688
02:17:50,383 --> 02:17:51,419
白光！
Daylight!

1689
02:17:51,458 --> 02:17:52,873
快点
Come on!

1690
02:17:52,904 --> 02:17:54,724
这儿，踩好
Here, on your feet.

1691
02:18:01,008 --> 02:18:04,329
等等，我的宝贝
[Gollum still screaming]

1692
02:18:01,008 --> 02:18:04,329
GOLLUM: Wait... my precious.

1693
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:06,209
等等
Wait!

1694
02:18:06,373 --> 02:18:08,193
咕鲁！咕鲁！
Gollum! Gollum!

1695
02:19:55,758 --> 02:19:58,016
巴金斯
Baggins!

1696
02:19:58,498 --> 02:20:00,974
小偷
Thief!

1697
02:20:01,753 --> 02:20:07,032
诅咒他，诅咒他，我们永远丢掉他了！
Curse it and crush it, we lost it for ever!

1698
02:20:18,435 --> 02:20:22,003
五，六，七，八
GANDALF: Five... Six... Seven.. Eight...

1699
02:20:22,191 --> 02:20:24,446
比弗，波弗，十了
Bifur... Bofur... that's ten,

1700
02:20:24,494 --> 02:20:27,056
奇力，菲力，十二了
Fíli, Kíli... that's twelve,

1701
02:20:27,329 --> 02:20:30,272
庞柏，十三了
And Bombur, that makes thirteen.

1702
02:20:30,819 --> 02:20:32,381
比尔博呢？
Where's Bilbo?

1703
02:20:33,311 --> 02:20:35,131
你们的霍比特人呢？
Where is your hobbit?

1704
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:38,340
我们的霍比特人呢？
Where is our hobbit?

1705
02:20:39,754 --> 02:20:41,462
该死的哈夫林！
GLOIN: Curse that Halfling!

1706
02:20:41,556 --> 02:20:44,220
现在他走丢了？我以为他和朵力在一起
Now he's lost? I thought he was with Dori!

1707
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:45,798
别怨我
DORI: Don't blame me!

1708
02:20:45,885 --> 02:20:47,272
你最后一次见他是在哪？
GANDALF: And where did you last see him?

1709
02:20:47,421 --> 02:20:50,426
他们第一次围困我们时，我看见他逃了
BIFUR: I think I saw him slip away when they first cornered us.

1710
02:20:50,586 --> 02:20:52,406
到底发生了什么？告诉我！
GANDALF: And what happened exactly? Tell me!

1711
02:20:52,461 --> 02:20:54,287
我告诉你发生了什么
THORIN: I'll tell you what happened.

1712
02:20:54,381 --> 02:20:57,181
巴金斯大人逮着了机会就跑了
Master Baggins saw his chance and he took it!

1713
02:20:58,389 --> 02:21:00,868
他从一开始踏出家门起
He's thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth

1714
02:21:00,869 --> 02:21:03,449
就一心想着家里的暖床和壁炉
since first he stepped out of his door.

1715
02:21:03,793 --> 02:21:06,603
我们再也不会看到霍比特人了
We will not be seeing our hobbit again.

1716
02:21:06,783 --> 02:21:08,556
他早走了
He is long gone.

1717
02:21:20,705 --> 02:21:21,820
不
BILBO: No...

1718
02:21:22,609 --> 02:21:23,945
他没有
he isn't.

1719
02:21:27,612 --> 02:21:29,484
比尔博・巴金斯
GANDALF: Bilbo Baggins...

1720
02:21:29,693 --> 02:21:33,193
我从没因见到某人而这么高兴
I've never been so glad to see anyone in my life.

1721
02:21:34,532 --> 02:21:36,632
比尔博，我们以为你走了
KILI: Bilbo... We'd given you up!

1722
02:21:36,636 --> 02:21:38,659
你到底怎么通过妖精群的？
How on earth did you get past the goblins?

1723
02:21:38,669 --> 02:21:40,368
到底怎么做的？
DWALIN: How indeed?

1724
02:21:49,401 --> 02:21:51,221
那有什么关系？
Oh, why does it matter?

1725
02:21:51,672 --> 02:21:53,072
他回来了
He's back.

1726
02:21:53,477 --> 02:21:54,570
有关系
It matters.

1727
02:21:54,985 --> 02:21:56,883
我想知道
I want to know...

1728
02:21:58,474 --> 02:22:00,264
你为什么回来？
why did you come back?

1729
02:22:03,516 --> 02:22:06,601
我知道你质疑我，我知道你一直这样
I know you doubt me. I know-  I know you always have.

1730
02:22:08,133 --> 02:22:10,933
你说得对，我时常想念袋底洞
And you're right, I often think of Bag End.

1731
02:22:11,667 --> 02:22:13,487
我怀念我的书
I miss my books...

1732
02:22:14,448 --> 02:22:16,690
我的扶椅，我的花园
and my arm chair, and my garden.

1733
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:19,821
瞧，我就属于那里
See, that's where I belong.

1734
02:22:20,313 --> 02:22:21,782
那是家
That's home.

1735
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:26,539
我回来的原因是……
And that's why I came back, cause...

1736
02:22:28,205 --> 02:22:30,726
你们没有，家
you don't have one. A home.

1737
02:22:31,867 --> 02:22:33,702
它被抢走了
It was taken from you.

1738
02:22:36,425 --> 02:22:38,766
但如果我能，我要帮你们夺回来
But I will help you take it back if I can.

1739
02:22:59,110 --> 02:23:02,165
[Wargs growling]

1740
02:23:02,066 --> 02:23:03,366
追上他们

1741
02:23:03,766 --> 02:23:05,966
把他们扯成碎片

1742
02:23:12,486 --> 02:23:13,852
刚出狼窝
Out of the frying pan.

1743
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:15,983
又入虎穴
And into the fire.

1744
02:23:16,007 --> 02:23:16,700
跑
Run.

1745
02:23:16,907 --> 02:23:18,115
跑
Run!

1746
02:24:02,212 --> 02:24:03,945
爬到树上，都上去！
GANDALF: Up into the trees. All of you!

1747
02:24:04,008 --> 02:24:07,263
快点，爬，比尔博，爬
Come on, climb, Bilbo. Climb!

1748
02:24:18,326 --> 02:24:19,446
他们来了
THORIN: They're coming!

1749
02:25:20,874 --> 02:25:22,436
阿索格
THORIN: Azog!

1750
02:25:28,336 --> 02:25:30,836
你闻到了吗？

1751
02:25:31,836 --> 02:25:34,136
恐惧的气味

1752
02:25:37,736 --> 02:25:43,336
我记得你父亲就散发着恐惧

1753
02:25:43,636 --> 02:25:46,436
索林，索恩之子

1754
02:25:49,105 --> 02:25:51,071
这不可能
It cannot be...

1755
02:25:58,171 --> 02:25:59,671
那个是我的

1756
02:26:00,371 --> 02:26:01,971
干掉其他的

1757
02:26:30,371 --> 02:26:31,971
喝了他们的血

1758
02:27:34,834 --> 02:27:35,954
菲力
GANDALF: Fíli!

1759
02:28:11,071 --> 02:28:12,191
不！
GANDALF: No!

1760
02:28:14,405 --> 02:28:15,803
不！
Aah no!

1761
02:28:20,078 --> 02:28:21,445
不！
Oh no!

1762
02:28:25,570 --> 02:28:27,390
甘道夫先生
DORI: Mister Gandalf!

1763
02:28:32,967 --> 02:28:34,087
稳住，诺力
ORI: Hold on, Nori!

1764
02:28:41,715 --> 02:28:43,535
[The Pale Orc growls]

1765
02:30:04,234 --> 02:30:06,952
不
BALIN: Nooo!

1766
02:30:17,752 --> 02:30:20,648
索林，不！
DWALIN: Thorin! No!

1767
02:30:39,148 --> 02:30:42,248
把那矮人的头给我砍来

1768
02:31:32,248 --> 02:31:33,848
杀了他

1769
02:34:08,126 --> 02:34:09,758
索林
BOFUR: Thorin!

1770
02:35:24,764 --> 02:35:25,884
索林
GANDALF: Thorin!

1771
02:35:29,948 --> 02:35:31,219
索林
Thorin.

1772
02:35:48,744 --> 02:35:49,864
我失败了吗？
Have I failed?

1773
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:51,880
那是你的权利
It's your right.

1774
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:56,015
比尔博在这里，他很安全
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.

1775
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:07,795
你！
THORIN: You!

1776
02:36:11,295 --> 02:36:12,574
你傻了吗？
What were you doing?

1777
02:36:13,496 --> 02:36:15,878
你不知道自己可能丧命？
You know you could've yourself killed?

1778
02:36:17,902 --> 02:36:20,376
我没说过你是个负担吗？
Did I not say that you would be a burden?

1779
02:36:21,236 --> 02:36:23,374
你不可能在荒野里逃生
That you would not survive in the wild...

1780
02:36:24,916 --> 02:36:27,405
你在我们间没有地位
and you had no place amongst us.

1781
02:36:32,379 --> 02:36:35,744
我一辈子从没这么失误过
I have never been so wrong, in all my life.

1782
02:36:48,431 --> 02:36:50,225
对不起，我质疑你了
Well, I'm sorry I doubted you.

1783
02:36:50,257 --> 02:36:52,357
不，我……我也会质疑自己
BILBO: No, I-  I would have doubted me too.

1784
02:36:53,429 --> 02:36:56,004
我不是英雄，不是战士
I'm not a hero... nor a warrior.

1785
02:36:58,474 --> 02:37:00,294
甚至不是小偷
Not even a burglar.

1786
02:37:19,142 --> 02:37:22,493
那是什么？你们觉得？
BILBO: What's that? What do you think it is?

1787
02:37:37,266 --> 02:37:39,203
伊鲁柏
GANDALF: Erebor!

1788

孤山
The Lonely Mountain.

1789
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:47,051
中土世界大矮人王国的遗骸
The last of the Great Dwarf Kingdoms of Middle- earth.

1790
02:37:49,126 --> 02:37:50,936
我们的家
THORIN: Our home.

渡鸦
OIN: A raven!

1792
02:37:56,581 --> 02:38:00,063
