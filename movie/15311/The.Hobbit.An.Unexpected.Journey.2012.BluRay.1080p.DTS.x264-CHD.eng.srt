OIN:
A raven!

1916
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:00,089
The birds are returning to the mountain.

1917
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:07,405
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

1918
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:10,528
But we'll take it as a sign.

1919
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:14,002
- A good omen.
- You're right.

1920
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,289
I do believe the worst is behind us.

NEIL FINN [SINGING]:
<i>Far over the misty mountains rise</i>

1923
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:24,126
<i>Leave us standing upon the height</i>

1924
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:28,365
<i>What was before</i>

1925
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:32,650
<i>We see once more</i>

1926
02:40:33,800 --> 02:40:39,011
<i>Is our kingdom a distant light</i>

1927
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:46,410
<i>Fiery mountain beneath the moon</i>

1928
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:54,405
<i>The words unspoken, we'll be there soon</i>

1929
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:59,009
<i>For home a song</i>

1930
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,083
<i>That echoes on</i>

1931
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:09,365
<i>And all who find us will know the tune</i>

1932
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:15,929
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

1933
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:20,042
<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

1934
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:24,009
<i>Haven't seen the back of us yet</i>

1935
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:28,282
<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

1936
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:32,203
<i>All eyes on the hidden door</i>

1937
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:36,282
<i>To the Lonely Mountain borne</i>

1938
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:40,249
<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

1939
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:45,931
<i>Until we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

1940
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:53,688
<i>We lay under the misty mountains cold</i>

1941
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:58,046
<i>In slumbers deep</i>

1942
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,680
<i>And dreams of gold</i>

1943
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:06,729
<i>We must awake</i>

1944
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:10,604
<i>Our lives to make</i>

1945
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:16,640
<i>And in the darkness a torch we hold</i>

1946
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:24,050
<i>From long ago when lanterns burned</i>

1947
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:28,684
<i>Until this day</i>

1948
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,047
<i>Our hearts have yearned</i>

1949
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:36,525
<i>Her fate unknown</i>

<i>The Arkenstone</i>

1951
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,480
<i>What was stolen</i>

1952
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:48,081
<i>Must be returned</i>

1953
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:07,726
<i>We must awake</i>

1954
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:11,766
<i>And make the day</i>

1955
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:18,002
<i>To find a song for heart and soul</i>

1956
02:43:21,720 --> 02:43:24,963
<i>Some folk we never forget</i>

1957

<i>Some kind we never forgive</i>

1958

<i>Haven't seen the end of it yet</i>

1959

<i>We'll fight as long as we live</i>

1960

<i>We'll ride in the gathering storm</i>

<i>Till we get our long-forgotten gold</i>

1964

<i>Far away from misty mountains cold</i>
